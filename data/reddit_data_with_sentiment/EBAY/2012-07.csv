Ebay,Buyer has re-listed the item I have already paid for.,"I won an auction for a swiss rucksack and promptly paid for the item on June 22, the same day the auction ended. The item has not been shipped, and I have tried to communicate with the seller to try and rectify this problem but the seller has not responded. I discovered that the seller has re-listed the item I have already purchased using the exact same pictures. The seller has over 3000 positive feedback and is a top-rated seller, while I have 16 feedback, all positive. My money is tied up, I don't want to be refunded because the rucksack is worth much more to me than what I paid for it.

Ebay,"Having some trouble with a buyer, definitely think he's trying to scam me. Help?","**Case Closed**

So thanks to a very helpful ebay employee my case has been closed in my favor, thank you for the advise and help. Blocked the guy and wont be in contact or dealing with him again, thankfully.

___________________________________________




So a two days ago I sold tickets to an ebayer and it seems today he has received his purchase today. However he has now filed a case against me saying I have not sent him what he paid for. I 100% know that the tickets he received are legit, that the tickets are what he received and that all the information in my description was 100% accurate. 

I phoned ebay to see if there was anything I could do to help my case, they were very little help. The help he gave me was to just try convince him that the tickets are legit although this guy is claiming he didn't get said tickets.


*Here is the case message log:*

**Details provided by the buyer:**
The buyer said the item doesn't match your description
The buyer has tried contacting you
The buyer paid on 01 Jul, 2012

**More comments:** dear ebay, seller hasn't responded yet as i just sent the email.
The buyer did not give permission to share a phone number with you.
The item is wrong
Additional information:
""I paid for tickets to go to a festival, I didn't pay to get postcards sent to me. Please help me out I paid £215 for the tickets, to get postcards sent instead. Many thanks""


**The buyer wanted:**
The buyer prefers to return the item in exchange for a full refund.

**Me to buyer:**
""The item sold to the buyer is exactly as pictured and described. I sent him 2 tickets for wireless festival in London that I won through a Turborg competition. If he is claiming they are fake because they say the cost was £0.00 that is because they were won through a competition. The tickets pictured on the item page are exactly what was sent to the buyer through tracked next day delivery. I will not let my ebay reputation be put down by one man claiming I have scammed him when I 100% have not.""

**Buyer to me:** ""I SAID POSTCARDS!!! I DIDN'T SAY THE EXACT TICKETS THAT ARE SHOWN IN THE PICTURE. I KNOW HOW THESE TICKETS WORK. I DIDN'T GET WHAT I PAID FOR. YOU THE SELLER SCAMMED ME AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK. IF YOU DON'T THEN I WILL SERIOUSLY LEAVE A BAD FEEDBACK!""

**Me to buyer:** ""Well if you could prove that you got postcards and not tickets that would be good, because I do not believe you at all.""

**Buyer to me:** WHETHER YOU BELIVE ME OR NOT, THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY; I WILL TAKE PICTURES OF THE POSTCARDS AND SENT YOU IT.

**Me to buyer:** ""I asked you to take pictures a while ago... take pictures of everything you received, envelop etc.""

**Buyer to me:** And I responded saying yes I need to get a camera so I can proof you! ""

**Me to buyer:** I received no such message, the same as I received no message before you filed this claim despite the fact you said you had already tried to contact me and I did not reply.""

**I asked him again to take photos of what he recieved**

**Buyer to me:** YES OFCOURSE, DON'T FOOL ME WITH YOUR KIND RESPONSE!!!

**Me to buyer**: I'm not trying to fool you with a kind response. I'm trying to get this sorted out civilly but you're sending all caps responses accusing me of being a scammer which I am not. I sent you exactly as advertised and would like to see what you think I sent you. You have yet to provide any proof, while I have a photo of the tickets I sent you and the receipt from the Post Office where I bought the envelop and sent you the tickets. ""

_____________________________________________

Sorry for the long read but this guy is driving me mad, I don't know what he means by saying I sent him postcards, I definitely sent him the tickets. Anyone any ideas how I can solve this quickly?

Another problem is that if I accept him returning the tickets the concert is this weekend and the ticket will probably be useless.

Thanks


**Edit:** Just off the phone with ebay again and they have said that they're is very little I can do until the case has been open 8 days and then I can appeal the case to the resolution centre.

Ebay,Am I getting scammed? Something seems fishy here.,"I'm pretty new to eBay. I've been selling for about two weeks, just getting rid of some old stuff I've had sitting around forever (books, games, DVDs) and in the 20 or so items I've sold, I haven't had any issues until today.

I started a book at about $9, and it ended up getting bid up to $40, which is higher than I was expecting, but not completely insane. The winning bidder has 100% positive feedback and a score of 62,000, but they have feedback set to private. Payment was a little slow, but they paid today and I notice this message on the shipping screen:

&gt;USPS.com states that Media Mail (book rate) is $2.41 for the 1st lb and $.39 for each additional lb. Could you please send any overage I’ve paid for shipping via Paypal or simply place cash inside of the book cover? Whichever is easiest for you. Thanks very much! I look forward to the package arriving.


I googled around and this exact message appears a few times on the eBay forums, maybe from the same buyer. Basically, I don't know what to do. It seems a little fishy, but I'm not familiar enough with eBay to know what to do. Would you go through with the sale? I really don't like media mail, and sending this message after the auction has ended just strikes me as weird.

I just received an email telling me the person who outbid me on these items has withdrawn their bid making me the highest bidder, however, when I was outbid I took the money I intended to use on these items and spent it on another auction (I was under the impression that I had lost the chance of winning these items)

I am therefore unfortunately unable to cover the cost of this auction now and must request a bid retraction. I cannot express how sorry I am for this to have happened and hope that you still manage to make the money these items are worth.""

I'm pretty sure this guy is full of shit and just found cheaper tickets, especially since a well-honed system like ebay won't ""accidentally"" say he lost an auction when he actually won, so I go to leave negative feedback for this wishy-washy buyer.      
Only problem is, there is no option for negative feedback. Confused, I look up the ebay rules and sure as shit: ""While sellers can leave a positive Feedback rating and a comment for buyers, they can’t leave negative or neutral Feedback.""      
Fine, I'll leave a ""positive"" feedback but call him out in the notes. Wait a second, MORE ebay regulations about that sort of thing: ""We don't allow Feedback comments that contain... Negative statements left for a buyer that conflict with the positive rating""       
Can somebody please explain the logic of this and why it's okay for half-baked buyers to bid on things they're not going to buy?!

Ebay,"Haven't used eBay in awhile, decided to list a few things... Do folks not read listings?","Hiya folks! First off let me say I miss the old days where eBay didn't ""hold"" your money for you, I listed a few things thinking I could make some money before moving cross country but it turns out the money won't even free up until I'm already out there... Ha.

So anyway along with listing a few things, I also listed some watches for my father that belonged to my uncle -- they were Fossil watches that included the tins they come in the only issue was they needed new batteries (they've been in storage for like 6+ years, y'know?). I thought I had made it clear in the listing that the watches required new batteries, but otherwise were in great shape (my uncle had a really weird obsession of picking up really expensive stuff and just storing it).

First watch sold, I was thrilled. I even got it shipped that day (I love printing labels via eBay, that's definitely convenient) but after it was delivered today I got back a message from the buyer which stated ""Item I received is not as described"" and went on in semi-bad english to accuse me of misleading her and how she had purchased this for her anniversary and what was I going to do to help fix this -- suggesting I pay to have a ""watchman"" look at it/repair it...

Folks I'm about to be homeless after the 20th, luckily moving in with some family out in AZ but for all intents and purposes I won't even have a home until I drive out there -- I currently don't even have enough money to ship my own belongings ahead of me, much less help some person get a watch battery replaced.

I wanted to be snarky and rude but I responded by reiterating that my listing (included a link) clearly stated the battery needed to be replaced, but if they were still unhappy I would be happy to refund the money if they shipped it back (that's all I can do I figure).

Did I do something wrong here? Do eBay buyers not read listings or something? I would never bid/buy an item without reading the entire listing just to make sure I hadn't missed anything.

Two other watches of the four sold as well (via bids, auctions ended earlier today) but I'm hesitant to ship them because if they also didn't understand the watches require new batteries this is all an exercise in futility and I have more important things to do. I contacted them through eBay and I reiterated that the watches required batteries, waiting to hear back from them if they understand and are ok with that (if not I assume there's a way I can cancel the auction and refund their money?)

I'm now wondering if there's a way I can just cancel the auctions and not even bother shipping watches -- I don't really have the time or the money to be shipping watches across the US.

Anyone have any tips for when or if I use ebay again? Also is there something I could have done differently here?

Ebay,A question regarding automatic bids.,"I just bought something for $70 + shipping. There was only one other bidder, who bid the minimum ($69) a few days ago. For fear of being outbid, I added a few bucks onto my bid (making it $72), but ebay submitted my bid as $70.

Question portion: If the other bidder tried to bid $71 in the last few seconds of the auction, would my $72 bid have kicked in and trumped his? If we both offered $100+, would the automatic bidding just keep jumping up and up between us until the auction ended?

I'm especially confused because I lost a similar auction a few days ago, when I bid the minimum to be the high bidder, and someone outbid me by $2.50. If I had set my bid at $5 above the minimum, would his +$2.50 bid have been beaten out by my +$5 bid? What would have happened if his bid were actually $10 above the current high bid?",7,0,2012-07-10,EBAY,0.05720238387584686,0.8934306502342224,0.049366943538188934

Ebay,Advice Requested:  Returning to EBay as a Seller after about 1.5 years away...Questions inside!,"Hi everyone, I'm a long-time Reddit lurker and a casual seller on eBay.  I have some questions about returning to selling on eBay and figured the brilliant folks of Reddit are the best to ask! (This is my first post in 5 years or so on Reddit, so please forgive any formatting mistakes!)


My main question is:  **What has changed for sellers on eBay since about Winter 2010?**


Through perusing this sub, I've learned the following:
1. Postal rates have obviously increased.
2. eBay no longer allows sellers to leave feedback for buyers (?!?)
3. eBay &amp; PayPal now take a chunk of Shipping/Handling fees.
4. There are no listing fees for some amount of items in a certain period.


Please let me know any important changes I should be aware of, for example, how a seller can get burned these days, or things to watch out for.


Other specific questions:

1. I read that eBay (or PayPal) now holds a sellers money for a period of time, or something like that?  What is this all about?
2. If I insure or get delivery confirmation on a shipment, does eBay take a cut of that as well?
3. Can I still block international bidders?
4. I've noticed a lot of listings these days are ""Buy it now or Best Offer"".  Is this generally the best way to go?  Back when I used to sell, it seemed like the general ""auction"" style of eBay was on the decline (Or maybe just my items just weren't ""bidding frenzy"" provokers)....Is this the case still?


I know I'm asking a lot of questions here, but any help is very much appreciated!  Also, any tips for successful selling in the ""New"" eBay would be awesome!  (If it helps, I generally sell my old possessions, single items, in good condition)

Ebay,"As a seller, what do I need to do to protect myself from scammers?","After reading this forum - and a few others where there are horror stories about individuals selling things on ebay - I thought I covered my bases. 

I made an accurate listing of a used laptop. Sold it for the market price for the item. Before sending the item, I made a video of it's condition and in the same video showed myself packing it in the original manufacturers box and packaging materials. 

I shipped it to the buyer and a week after they received it they claim it was cracked but offer no proof and want to send it back for a full refund.

In my resolution center case I linked to the high res photos and to the video but was still ruled in the buyers favor.

Ebay,"So a guy says he never got the item, but the tracking info says delivered.. What should I do to avoid negative feedback?","So this guy writes me about 2 week ago, and says the item I sold him on ebay was not delievered, and the tracking information says it was delievered that day, and he wasn't sure what to do.


I told him not to worry about it, as sometimes the post office scans items going out for delivery as delivered, and maybe they just didn't have time to get to his place.

well 2 weeks goes by and he sends me this:

""I'm not sure what to do, the package has been lost somewhere?""


I assume he has not gotten it yet, and I'm not even sure how to respond to him. I realize i'm not obligated to refund him,  since I have proof that I mailed it.(i even saved the receipt), and I have the tracking number: 

https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction_input?qtc_tLabels1=03120860000094685219&amp;qtc_senddate1=&amp;qtc_zipcode1=


my question is what should I do? how should I respond? I've dealt with tons of assholes on ebay, I've dealt with scammers.(this guy MIGHT be one, but I'm not sure. he could have legitimately had his package stolen.), but I'm not sure how to respond to him.

I would offer him a refund, but I paid $10 to ship, and sold him the item for an additional $10. realistically the item cost me a little more than 8bucks to ship, and I paid $2 for the item itself. plus I paid ebays/paypals fees. and I'm sitting on very little profit. I don't want to refund him for the item, because i'd be losing out, and I'd feel stupid offering half of my profits which is like change. I doubt he would be happy with that anyways.  and I'd feel even worse if it went to a scammer.

Do i tell him: ""I'm sorry, it was probably stolen. goodluck!""

How would everyone handle this situation? does the post office have a department for dealing with stolen packages that are uninsured? getting negative feedback would suck, so i'd like to be sympathetic with the guy, but not get scammed.

Ebay,Questions about eBay Powerselling.,"So I posted an AMA request a while ago for eBay powersellers and never got much of a response, but then I stumbled onto this subreddit. I'm still debating trying my hand at eBay selling and I have a couple of questions. I've read all the older IAmAs about eBay sellers and I think they are fascinating. The thing is I've heard that the ""new eBay"" is a lot harsher on sellers than it was in the past, with high posting/selling fees and one sided feedback systems, and combined with the downturn in the economy it seems like it must be a difficult to make the small time eBay seller's model still work. Are there still small time eBay sellers out there and if so how are you making your living; just off of niche markets? Or are there only the big eBay stores and one time sellers left?",23,6,2012-07-12,EBAY,0.05079621821641922,0.9128046631813049,0.03639910742640495
Ebay,Buyer returned item despite me saying I would not accept returns,"I sold a tablet on ebay in mint condition and in my ebay auction I specifically checked the ""I will no accept returns"" box.  Later, while PMing the buyer I reiterated that I will not be accepting returns simply because the buyer ""doesn't like the purchase"" (because she simply doesn't like the device, similar to buying the tablet at bestbuy and returning it because you don't like it).  Today, out of nowhere, I received the tablet from the buyer (I have not opened the parcel, but I know that it's the tablet).  The money will clear through paypal in two days (the 21 day limit, the buyer has not left feedback yet) assuming the buyer doesn't cancel it or anything.  What should I do?

Ebay,"I have some large items that I would like to sell on eBay, they would need to be shipped via freight. Anyone have any advice on this? Details inside.","My father in law was a taxidermist, and when he passed away he had a shop full of animal mounts. I've been selling the ones that I'm able to box up here and there no problem on eBay. They sell surprisingly well too. I'm getting to the point where I need to unload some of the very large mounts. I mean one of them is two full running deer. It probably is in the vicinity of 60""x48""x48"" and probably weighs a couple hundred pounds. I also have some that are a bit smaller than that, but you get the idea these aren't going out via UPS or FedEx that's for sure. 

I could do 'local pickup' but I know this will vastly limit my potential buyers. I see a local shipper that offers freight services, but how do I coordinate this through eBay? Just list it as 'freight' and let the buyer know they will be responsible for whatever the cost ends up being? Can I just bring my item to these guys and let them box and pallet it up or should I do that part myself? 

If this isn't feasible I'm just going to contact a local auctioneer and see if they have an auction coming up that they would fit well into and see what happens, but eBay would probably net more profit in the end.

Ebay,Sold a Kindle Fire - Buyer hasn't paid nor contacted me.,"I'm new to Ebay and specifically signed up to Ebay and PayPal to sell of my Kindle Fire in favor of the new Nexus 7 coming soon.

So I put my Kindle Fire (with a case included) at a start price of $130. Three days later the bidding ended at a rather impressive price of $172.55. Normally these things go for less than $150 so I was a little shocked and definitely surprised. 

Sadly, the buyer hasn't paid or contacted me despite me attempting to get into contact with him. It's been nearly three days now and I'm assuming that at this point I have a non-paying buyer.

Should I immediately open a case at the 4 day mark? Or what should I do? And what can I do to prevent things like this from happening in the future?

Ebay,My recent ebay / paypal refund story... Also a warning to those might do this in the future...,"Alright then, on June 21, I sold a model car to Bobbo (Buyer's story name.) in Australia. He sent me a message after it ended right after it ended for $18.50 stating he was also going to try and buy one more that was ending soon.  He didn't win the second auction and then paid for the first one.  I had close to twenty auctions ending that day, so I wasn't able to send his invoice out with the corrected shipping amount, but it didn't matter since he already paid... Or so I thought.  Once I got to his auction I noticed the shipping quote was way to high and and he actually paid it, around $45 just for shipping.  I've already sold a bunch of these cars to Australia and the shipping is around $10 - $14 bucks each, since there small &amp; light.  I mail them out that afternoon and go back home to send him his shipping overcharge back as a refund through PayPal.  

His total came just over $60, so I went to refund him his $30.21.  But, being fast and not reading I put the invoice ID as 30.21 and left the $60 unchanged the the amount box.  So, I inadvertently refunded him everything  car payment and shipping and I also have no car since I already mailed it out.

I try messaging him (4x over a week) and calling him (3x over the same week &amp; ebay gave me his info after the first call to them.) and get nothing as he ignores me, while still buying other models on ebay.  I try getting ebay involved, but they can't get my money back as his PayPal account isn't linked to his ebay account.  Ebay, also tells me to open a non-payment dispute again him, which I tried previously and couldn't do because it showed on ebay that he had paid.  I then try to get Paypal involved who say that there is no way to reverse a refund / pull money out of his account.  Damn...

So a few more days pass, still no money or car.  I know I'll never see the model as it has already left the country and I either want my money or the car at this point, so I try calling ebay and PayPal again.  Same story with ebay and PayPal at first.  But, while on the PayPal call I ask to speak with the customer service guy's supervisior.  (I hate to do that to him, but sometimes it has to be done...)  He tell me that he can't transfer me while he's on the phone and he'll have his supervisor call me back in five minutes.  We hang up, I'm disappointed as I'm doubtful the boss will call me back, but no less than five minutes later, I've got the boss on the phone.  He actually said the same thing that there was no way to reverse a refund, but he still ended up giving me a credit to my account of the $30 I was out.  YAAAA  I just have to wait and see what kind of feedback he leaves, if any at all.  Overall, I'm happy with the outcome.

TL;DR - Pay attention when giving refunds.",1,0,2012-07-14,EBAY,0.08423282951116562,0.8883067965507507,0.027460359036922455

Ebay,eBay newbie has some questions,"Hey fellas,

I've been trying to find a Celtics jersey since last week. After I created a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/wrgvw/an_unusual_request_please_help_me_find_paul/) over at /r/BostonCeltics with a hope that maybe someone would reach out to me and sell me the jersey because I couldn't find it online (there are some websites that actually sell the thing, but they seem like a scam). Anyway, someone reached out to me and is willing to sell me the item. We've talked a bit and he's willing to sell me the item by putting it on eBay (first we were planning on making the transaction via PayPal) and the payment option will probably be PayPal. 

I'll cut to the chase; how safe is this? If I don't get the item at all, can I get my refund via PayPal or eBay? If I get the item, but the item is not legit (as in if it's a fake jersey), can I still be refunded? I'm from overseas, so shipment might be tricky. If the seller actually ships the item and I don't get it, can I be refunded? Is there anything I should be aware of before I buy the item?

Obviously this is far from the best way, and I am likely off a little bit each time.

My question is, how anal is USPS with how close you have to be? Will they send your package back/not take it if you are too far off? Do they even weigh the items themselves at all after you have your own label from home on the package? (I'm using ebay's label printing service from home)

Ebay,Are buyers actually more attracted to free shipping?,"I understand in theory that a buyer wouldn't want to pay for shipping, but what if the prices add up to the same value?

In my mind, I would think buyers would be more likely to buy something for $90 plus $10 shipping versus $100 and free shipping simply due to the fact they may feel they are getting a better deal by the price itself being less.

Also when you search, it doesn't show the shipping price, if there is one, so they may be more likely to look at your listing since they have no idea what the price will be.

Can any big time sellers weigh in on if they have more success with free shipping or a lower price on the item and shipping? (same total value)",16,11,2012-07-23,EBAY,0.037824224680662155,0.9107339978218079,0.051441777497529984

Ebay,Shipping reimbursement,"So I use half.com to sell old textbooks I no longer need.

I recently noticed, selling this year, that the commission is a lot more which was roughly $4. Now it is in the $6 range.  

I can only ship these books cheaply through USPS which cost me about $8 every time.

Now I don't mind I'm using their services. But if they are going to charge the buyer for shipping which is roughly $3-$4 then shouldn't that be sent to me directly rather than charging me this gross commission price and insulting me by reimbursing me for shipping for $2.   

I call the number to customer service which is a call center in the Philippines. No worries, my bestfriend is Filipino I enjoy their culture and don't mind an accent hidden in their fake American accents. 

Well after 20mins on the phone with her, she basically kept trying to repeat in a coherent thought that this was my fault I shouldn't have signed the terms and conditions and I should read it next time. I told her yes I don't have 72 years to read all the disclamers and legal gargle that people hide behind. I asked if it is possible if they can compensate me for the least. 

She (obviously being coached by management) was again saying incoherent thoughts hard to understand seeing that they were from a higher up. It's bullshit really I don't think I am comfortable with their service again. The attitude was yeah we are a big company you can't fight us either get use to it or make your prices higher to adjust.  But then I lost it at this point and pointed out that it is still going to be an unjust percentage your taking away from me still. **Where is dat feel ebay?!**

Ebay,How do I navigate this situation without getting shafted by the seller?,"I bought a Penny Nickel skateboard from a Buy It Now auction which gave me the ability to select the color I wanted from a drop down menu.

He said that I could choose a different color or wait for him to receive and ship one of the color that I wanted, with a $10 credit and some ""goodies ;-)"".

Meanwhile, the transaction sits in My Ebay as paid for, but not shipped. Is there a period of time, after which I can no longer dispute the transaction? I have no problem waiting for the seller to eventually ship me the color I want, but not if after 15 days or something I lose the right to dispute the transaction.

Secondly, the ""$10 credit""... is that to this guys online store, or a refund? Do I need to clarify this with him?

Hi,
I'm not available for a local pick-up.

- knowsguy

-----------------------------------------------------------

Dear knowsguy,

You could have spelled this out specifically in your original listing as well as in subsequent emails that you sent me instead of making bogus excuses about being out of town. What you are doing is making money--and a considerable amount (I know, I've sold plenty of stuff on ebay without charging people for anything besides postage)--on the shipping process. I will not pay 30$ for something that it costs you 10$ to ship. I made my bid with the understanding that I would be in Concord (and that I know someone there) and would therefore not have to pay your rip-off shipping charge. If you want to ship it, you can charge me a reasonable fee. Say $15. Otherwise, you will have to relist it. And if you give me a negative comment you better believe I'll do the same.

Dear p-----,

Hi again, I just wanted to let you know that I planned on sending this item via insured Parcel Post with Signature Confirmation.
The packaged item weighs 17 pounds, and the Post Office would have charged me $26.10, leaving me with $3.40 towards the cost of the box and bubble wrap, not to mention the fact that ebay charges me a fee on shipping. I never said I charge exact shipping, which is why I state ""S&amp;H"" (shipping and handling). It was not my intention to mislead anybody. If you would respond to the cancellation request, I can then attempt to sell it elsewhere. Thanks in advance.

Dear knowsguy,

Yes, you can go ahead and cancel this transaction.

Dear p-----,


Now you see why I don't do local pick-ups. At first, you sounded like a
semi-reasonable person, then you threw a fit because I didn't agree to you
inviting a stranger to my house. THEN you go on to make a complete fool of
yourself by guessing that a 17 pound package costs $10 to ship. I've met
some smug, self-centered, obnoxious folks in my life, but, then, you came
along, and showed me what I've been missing. I would be horrifically
embarrassed if I made such wildly inappropriate requests and accusations,
but, I'm sure you'll find a way to justify the crappy way you've treated an
honest seller. Great job.

Dear knowsguy,

What do you mean ""now you see."" Here's what I see. If you
had told the truth right off we wouldn't have had this problem in the first
place. Oh, and it costs you nothing to put ""no local pickups in your
listing"". In addition, I've recently bought several items of equal or
greater value and weight where I was charged anywhere from 10-20$ for
shipping. Fact: You are making a profit on shipping and now you are getting
all self-righteous because you got caught with your hand in the cooky jar.

Ebay,"Sold a concert ticket online, buyer gave me the wrong address, it might not arrive in time!","So, I sold an item on ebay for the first time a couple weeks ago and really wanted to do it right. It was a ticket for a concert this coming Thursday, 8/2. 

I sent it Priority Mail (I wanted to have a tracking number) on the 18th of July. However, two days later, the Track &amp; Confirm page gets updated with ""Insufficient address,"" and then immediately with ""Sorting Complete."" It hasn't arrived, and the page has not been updated since. I started getting nervous earlier this week, so I opened a ""case file"" and USPS ""put an agent on it"" a couple days ago, but still haven't heard anything back.

My question is, if the ticket can't get to the buyer in time, will I be held liable? In the case of a normal item, I'd assume the seller would just resend, but after Thursday the ticket will be worthless. The buyer did give me the wrong address; something is also up with USPS, because if the address was ""insufficient,"" it should have been sent back to me immediately (a week ago). I'm doing everything I can (I'm going to call the local post office tomorrow to see if it's being held there for some reason), but what happens if it's lost? I've never sold something on ebay before so I don't know how the claim process works...

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",12,3,2012-07-28,EBAY,0.06721524149179459,0.8980847001075745,0.03470000624656677
Ebay,Are these UGG boots fake?,"Hello /r/eBay!
I have been looking for some UGG Hannen boots for ages, and I just stumbled upon [what looks like a great deal on eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/UGG-MEN-HANNEN-CORDOVAN-LEATHER-Boot-US-11-EU-44-5-UK-10-/251029060616?pt=US_Men_s_Shoes&amp;hash=item3a727f7c08). I almost ordered them straight away, but now I am glad I hesitated.

The price seems almost too good to be true, almost $100 less than other online stores. They do look very real in the photos tho, and the seller has lots of positive feedback.

I am now very unsure, so I turn to you. Are these UGG Hannen boots fake, or are they the real deal?

Ebay,Someone help me from all the scammers!,"So, I am trying to list my Macbook Air and Canon t2i on ebay. I listed the two items a month ago and they both sold. The thing is, there were scammers who wanted to get my paypal email to send me a fake email that I got the money. The person who bought the Macbook Air said:

""Hello quickly send me your verified paypal email address so i can send the payment now.""

I said ok and sent my paypal email. Then they sent me a fake email from paypal that said they made the payment. 

Also, ""I will proceed with transfer of the funds as soon as possible,so you will receive a payment confirmation mail from paypal as soon as i send the payment so you can get the item shipped.""
I almost shipped the computer, but realized it was a scam. 

I then sold my Canon t2i. I got an email from the buyer:

""Hello just to inform you that i have send the payment per your request so check your paypal email inbox and spam folder for the confirmation mail of the payment from paypal and follow the procedure given to you due to the hold on the payment.
Confirm the shipping address

Name   Daniel Olusegun Peter

Address  No 22 Adams Street Dugbe

City        Ibadan

State      Oyo

Zipode    23402

Country   Nigeria.

Make sure the shipment is made by usps express mail international and send the tracking number to paypal as soon as you get the item shipped so they can verify and they can quickly release the hold on the 

payment...

Thanks..""

I knew that was a scam, and told the buyer that it was.

Now, after waiting a month because ebay won't let me sell the two items in the category, because I am on a new account (I'm a longtime ebayer), I re-list the computer. 

I sell the computer, then get this message:

""Hello,I just won your item. Am buying it for my grandson as a birthday gift and i will also take care of the shipping cost.Should i make the payment to this Paypal email address (*my ebay name* at yahoo.com)?Please get back to me as soon as possible.i want to be sure via payment.Thanks""

I know again this is a scam. I am annoyed that I can't sell my valuable items without scammers buying my shit. Oh, and I now have to pay ebay $130 for insertion fees, when I didn't even receive a payment. Please help me reddit.",6,2,2012-07-30,EBAY,0.051391564309597015,0.9200008511543274,0.028607606887817383

So payment went through paypal but didn't show up on my bank account yet. What is the likely issue? Is this going to show up in my account?

Ebay,Some good ole fashion buyer stupidity,"So this buyer said their paypal account wasn't accepting their credit card or something so they couldn't pay anymore. I opened a cancel transaction case and then the next day they said they got the CC onto paypal and can now pay. I tried closing the case, but apparently you can't yet. So I called ebay customer support to ask what to do (to be certain) and they said to have the buyer pay and then decline the case.

So, I send this exact message to the buyer

""ok then you have to pay first and then go to the case and hit DECLINE.

its vital you do this in the CORRECT ORDER

1. PAY
2. DECLINE CASE

i called up ebay and this is what they said to do

So, what does the buyer do? Declines the case first.
