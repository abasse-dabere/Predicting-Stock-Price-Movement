Ebay,"Give me one good reason to try to ""work things out"" with a buyer who has opened a case against me","Update:  I called Ebay earlier and they said I seem to have listed everything correctly with clear photos and the right condition description. The rep said I answered the case well, too. She said she couldn't do anything about the case until the buyer responded and even then, we had to wait the full 7 days to escalate.

The buyer responded to me this afternoon admitting he hadn't read the description and that it was his fault, but blamed me for listing the item for parts or repair as ""no one would want to buy this for parts."" Yeah, whatever. This being Ebay, I'm still worried I will do something to cause the defect to be unremovable, allow him to leave negative feedback (I think if I win the case, he can't leave negative feedback, but this seems to change daily), or I'll get some crazy rep who inexplicably decides in the buyer's favor. The rules at Ebay seem to change every couple of weeks and no one--buyers, sellers, or customer service reps--seems to have a firm grasp on what's going on anymore.

*******************************

I just had a buyer open an item not as described case against me for an item they say doesn't work. The thing is, the item was listed as ""for parts or repair"" and the listing explicitly stated it didn't work and I provided numerous photos of the damaged pieces that needed to be replaced and described the damage.

Clearly the buyer didn't read one word of the description or condition and now wants a working replacement. The item isn't that expensive, but I'm 

#1 not going to replace the item
#2 going to eat shipping both ways for their own mistake (I sent it with free shipping)
#3 not really motivated to do anything since I've already received the defect. 

A defect up front just removes any incentive to try to please the customer or work things out, in my opinion. I know I could still get a negative out of this, too. I have 100% positive feedback, but it seems like negatives and low DSRs don't even really count anymore with the new defect system. What is the incentive here?",9.0,5,2014-10-01,EBAY,0.09968787431716919,0.8643187284469604,0.035993434488773346
Ebay,Buyer's account was fraudulently accessed. Should I recall the package?,"I got an email from eBay yesterday, saying that the buyer of a jacket I recently shipped had their account hacked, and that the purchase was fraudulent. It said that my listing had been cancelled and fees refunded...but it didn't address the fact that the item was already sold, and I was already paid via Paypal. It did not say that the customer would be getting their money back from me in the future, but maybe that's implied.

The jacket is still in transit via UPS. Should I recall it so that I'm not out both money and product when the customer goes to eBay/PayPal to get a refund for the fraudulent purchase?",8.0,5,2014-10-01,EBAY,0.14224612712860107,0.8227983117103577,0.03495561331510544
Ebay,Does using eBay's global shipping center resolve any of the problems associated w/ USA shipping to EU?,"EBay has been pushing their global shipping center to us folks in North America for a while now. For example, whenever I put a new auction up, it's automatically selected, indicating that I'm willing to ship to their global center, permitting them to move my merchandise off to Europe and other scenic locales. 

I still have reservations though, and wonder if this center actually helps us sellers avoid the international return and fraud hassles. 

Is this new center taking any of the problems off our shoulders?

I don't know. Your thoughts?

Ebay,Buyer can't bid due to my strict bidding requirements -- do I make an exception?,"Hey folks, y'all have been a real help to me in the past, so I'm coming to you for help again.

Here's the deal: selling some high-end designer jeans. They're one of the main italian brands, so they are attracting a lot of attention. It's GOOD because more attention means more potential bidders, it's BAD because it also means more potential scammers, and pickier buyers (lots of knockoffs floating around, mine are legit though! Bought them myself from the designer's flagship boutique store).

Right now there are 5 days left and quite a few watchers, but no bids. I got a message from a potential buyer asking me if I'd sell them to him at the starting price and end the auction early. I have it listed with free priority shipping and I told him I'd really like to get more, so I would probably just let the auction run its course.

He messages me saying, ""no prob i got costs just make the startin price higher, i bid and u sell to me."" I honestly just want to sell them quickly and it's not that big of a deal so I agreed. I raise the auction price to give me a little more profit after shipping costs and let him know.

Then he sends me a message saying, ""ey man i xant bid they wont let me i got 2 unpaid so i xant its 2 things i dont want but i want these plz man maybe try buy it now? I font want anyone else 2 get em i need em man plz""

...so now what do I do? He essentially told me he sometimes doesn't pay for winning auctions when he decides he doesn't want them. That's throwing up a big red flag for me. He has 200+ 100% positive feedback, but as we all know that doesn't really mean anything for a buyer-only account.

My instinct is telling me to just block him and forget about it. The auction has plenty of watchers. But what if I'm missing out on an easy and quick transaction? Or a repeat customer? Or, what if he has a separate account (or makes one) and bids it up or buys something else in my store just to leave negative feedback?

Ebay,Feedback extortion - Report buyer immediately or wait for return?,"Sold an item (a fragile 78rpm record set with three discs).

Buyer claims one disc was not the correct one for that set and initiates return.

I apologize profusely and assure buyer all costs will be refunded upon return.

Buyer now says they do not want to return the item but want a full refund anyway.

His reply to my sincere apology and agreement to refund:

""I must say that while appearing earnest, I dont buy your response. You are an ebay member, and am quite sure you price to make a profit.Your asking price was half of so of what is being asked for the purportedly same item.I find it impossible to believe you would put this up for 50 % less than the same item being sold by another person.I thought it would be that the scoring of the quality of the disc would be the reason for the very low asking price.I was wrong. 

I suggest you give this to me for free for my hassle and disappointment and thus allowing me to avoid the hassle of repackaging and return as your item will likely have zero value if you list it as truly is-an incomplete mixed match.Otherwise you leave me no choice but to rate your service as deceptive and disreputable.""

I believe the item was complete, but my photos did not show all three discs, so I have no proof and accept that as my error. I am afraid if he does return it, he will substitute one of the discs and leave bad feedback. He claims it will have no value incomplete, so I should give it to him, but the cover alone has some value. The item sold for $130, incomplete it may only be worth $30. Return shipping will add another $15 or so.

Ebay,Was I wrong for refunding this guy instead of sending him the item?,"I sold a super nintendo system for $31 via buy it now format. the buyer purchased the item on sunday(post office closed), I have a 3 day handling period on my listing. he sent me a message Sunday night asking me if the item is shipped yet. I explained to him that I was a little backed up and I would get the item out on tuesday, and that the post office is closed on sunday so it was impossible for me to have already shipped the item.

tuesday morning around 6am pacific time I login to ebay, check my feedback as I see i have 4 new feedbacks, and he left me the following negative feedback:


""Horrible seller. I never want to deal with a guy like this again""


he has a history of leaving similar negative feedback to other users. infact 13 negative feedbacks in 40 purchases.

I highly doubt 9 of his 40 transactions have been ""broken"" as he claims, so instead of risking sending him the item, and have him come up with a new claim, I decided to give him a full refund and relist the item.


he sent me a message right after the refund saying:

""Why did u refund and not ship??!?""


I responded with:


I refunded you because of your past ebay purchase history made me feel uncomfortable, and you left me negative feedback when I communicated with you that the item would be shipped out today. My listing said 3 day handling time, and I told you I would ship it out within two, and send it priority if you needed it quickly. The feedback you left was unfair, and  you said didn't want to deal with me I assumed you wouldn't care to finish this transaction either.""



Now i know I came off as a smart ass, but I didn't re-read it when I wrote it out. he responds with this:

""well b/tch seemed like you took your sweet ass time to ship it that's why I left that feedback""


I ignored the message and he sends me this one 30 minutes later:

""The reason I did that was because you took forever to ship it. Can we plez start over?""





I've never canceled a transaction because I didn't care for the person, but honestly I think this guy has a terrible attitude, and I do feel like he would be the type to lie about a product having a defect when it does not.

It's used, over 3 years old, and it's a known issue that they are suffering, it's all over the internet, and the buyer wasn't willing to try a different dart.

Ebay,eBay not enforcing Extortion Policy,"tl/dr I recently sold brand new software on eBay and was extorted for a partial refund by the buyer. This directly violates eBay policy and they are refusing to take action.

The full story -- I recently sold a brand new, retail packaged copy of Adobe CS to someone on eBay that disputed the condition after it arrived -- this was still in retail packaging, yet user said it had fingerprints all over it. User lectured me about being a liar, yet he had no proof and wouldn't even provide pictures -- simply demanding a partial refund.

Asking for a PARTIAL REFUND is a direct violation of eBay's Extortion Policy: http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/feedback-extortion.html (I'm hoping the redditors leave this link, as it is informational only and does not point to an eBay listing, but rather one of their policy pages.)

I was very aware that this user was extorting money from me -- demanding a partial refund from me in order to protect my 100% perfect feedback record. (I have been on eBay for over 14 years and have NEVER had even ONE negative feedback, until this guy.)

I responded to the user by informing him of the eBay policy against requesting partial refunds -- I offered him a FULL refund, DESPITE the fact I also listed the product as NO refunds. This was a software product and could easily be copied as soon as any buyer received it -- then they could complain and I'd have to pay them for stealing my software -- so I never allow refunds on software.

The user immediately rejected my offer for a FULL refund, and instead berated me for being a liar and a ""bad eBayer"" -- he reiterated that he wanted my product, because there was nothing wrong with it, but he again demanded a partial refund.

Again, I refused and offered a FULL refund if he would return the product.

User's response was to leave negative feedback for me -- concluding his EXTORTION attempt by untruthfully harming my public record. This was user's last action.

I immediately contacted eBay. I informed them of the situation, provided all messages and details -- even had the agent on the phone read ALL communications between us, and HE agreed it needed to go to whoever deals with this on their side. That was the last I've heard from them.

It's been almost 4 months and this criminal's negative feedback is still ruining my perfect score -- eBay is taking NO apparent action, thereby proving that they no longer care about user's extorting each other on their platform.

The only reason why I'm seeking advice is because of the endless amount of ""scams"" and ""problems"" people have had with eBay. I just want to make sure that the buyer is satisfied and legit. I don't want any problems and don't want to get ""hustled"" for sure.

Ebay,Worst ebay experience as a seller! Loss of 800 bucks!,"I kind of needed to let my anger out as well as seek for advise

I sold a Galaxy s5 on ebay close to 2 months ago. I specifically said ""no international shipping"" However, I got a message from someone asking me to ship it over seas. I then replied saying ""I prefer not to, but possibly if you win the bid"". He did not reply back so I assumed he wasn't interested. 
Later he ends up winning the bid.

I use eBay's preferred shipping method since they recommended. At this point, I have no knowledge on which shipping method is most reliable. I picked first class thinking it was reliable.

Long story short, my item has been in transit in NY Jamaica since August 13th. According to USPS, it's shipped out of country and there is nothing they can do.

Buyer wanted his money back. After a month of dispute, eBay decides to give the buyer his money back. 

So here I am having to pay the buyer full amount, plus, eBay isn't giving me the fee they charged me when I sold the item. I also paid 30 bucks for shipping, but most importantly I won't be getting the phone I sold.

Ebay,Why is this upcoming 180 day return policy (and Seller pays return shipping) not being talked about?,"I'm a little surprised there isn't more uproar about this. Perhaps I'm overreacting, perhaps people don't see it as I do. Basically in a nutshell, with the new changes starting November 18th, the way I see it, eBay will be providing a six month warranty for nearly anything sold, and the seller will have to pay return shipping. PayPal says it's not a warranty, but when all someone has to do is follow these steps six months later, it certainly sounds like one to me:

1. Six months out, open a claim that the item you bought is Not As Described.
2. Simple state ""this does not work"" or something similar and vague. 
3. Request that you want to return it for a full refund.

Your money will be immediately seized, and you will be given the choices of these: http://i.imgur.com/2eiwq5B.jpg

The buyer has to prove nothing. There's no appeal. There's no fighting it. Theoretically the new item you sold six months ago will be returned to you, used and broken, and you'll get to pay for it's return. 

I understand allowing for 180 days for ""Not received"", that's something you can prove and it would be nice if some overseas buyers didn't file a claim on day 45. I for one suspect many of those items show up later. But 180 to make up your mind it's ""As Described"" or not is just flat ridiculous to me.",65.0,15,2014-10-04,EBAY,0.02998177520930767,0.9178562760353088,0.052161891013383865

I was incredibly worried, but this morning I wake up and find that EVERY single auction has been bid up to beyond what my BIN prices would've been. I started them all at .99 NR. This is incredibly convenient for me. All auctions end at the same time, I get to ship all of the items at the same time, and I get all of the money at roughly the same time.

So basically they're going to be selling this to people, buyer is going to realize it isn't 1080P and request a refund, then buyer pays 2x shipping.

Ebay,Need help/advice from experienced sellers on how to sell clothing...,"So I've done some ebay sales in the past- mostly collectables- but no experience selling clothes. I've got a few dozen pairs of Buckaroo jeans (Korean designer, not sure if its more in line with the Diesel end of the spectrum, or the Wrangler end...), left over from a show a few years ago. They are imported, each still wrapped in the loose, sealed plastic they were shipped to our location in. They're in perfect shape, but I'm not sure how to photograph them/how to ship them/how to establish whether a Buy It Now, auction, or combination format is best, etc.
1- Should I remove these from the clear plastic for photographing? I feel like people would be much more comfortable buying clothes that haven't even been opened from the shipping plastic, but then, its much more difficult to photograph them or for the buyer to have a good idea about what they look like while they're folded over in plastic.
2- Is there any way to establish whether these will be more successful in auction format, or Buy It Now? There aren't a lot of these on eBay so I'm not sure how to establish this.
3- While I think a big segment of the buyers for these jeans will in fact be in Korea, I'm hesitant about international shipping. Seems very expensive, laden with potential issues/headaches, and I'd just assume avoid it. Ideas?
4- Anything else I should know about this? I can read the tags and post info but as most of this is in Korean and/or British English, I don't know what information to post with the ad so that people know whether they're their size, a style they want, whatever.

I actually looked around for a professional eBay seller in my area (Baltimore) but surprisingly, didn't find much.

Ebay,"Selling $300 worth of RAM, this is my first listing. Have I done everything I can to prevent scammers?","I just put up a listing for RAM with a fixed price of $300 (accidentally, I hit the enter button and it listed it even though I wasn't done yet). I have clearly listed the model number and state that I do not accept returns. My shipping is $5.80 economy shipping., and I made sure to not allow international shipping. 

After reading some horror stories on here, I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to make sure that once the item is sold, the buyer gets it, and I don't have to deal with the hassle of a return, or worse, deal with the hassle of a scammer.

Ebay,1st time seller w $1000 limit - listing item for less isn't working?,"Hello,

I'm selling my first item on ebay.

The item item I'm selling usually goes for $1200-$1600. I'm aware of the $1000 transaction limit I have. 

However, the auction won't post even when I list the starting price at something lower than $1000 (I've gone as low as $890 US - just a little lower than $1000 CAD).

Ebay,Feedback wanted from active eBay users for a start-up,"Hi,

Let me just start by telling you my name is Tyler and I am an active seller on eBay like many of you who view this subreddit. Throughout my time selling on eBay I have encountered many issues that bother me. A few of these are ebay taking 10% from final sale, 2-3% from PayPal, listing fees, and the buyers having too much power when it comes to claims. Just recently I was talking with one of my friends about this and then I got an idea. What if we (me and my friend) created a site similar to eBay that was 100% free and we took care of all the issues eBay sellers/buyers were complaining about? I did some research and found very few sites like this and the ones I did find none of them have any activity on them. This led me to believe that although it was free they weren't able to meet the needs of their customers and they would rather pay for the features of eBay.

Basically I'm just asking three questions:

If there was a site similar to eBay that was 100% free and you kept all of your money from sales would you switch over?

What would it take to get you to switch over? Like certain features or things that would make it worth it.

What are some current problems with eBay that you wish would be fixed or improved upon?

Please be as open and honest as possible and share every little thing no matter how small it seems. I am in the very very beginning of this start-up and any information you provide would be extremely helpful, and could quite possibly deliver you a product someday that you love (or so I hope).

I can't wait to hear what you all have to say!",0.0,1,2014-10-07,EBAY,0.026390613988041878,0.924731433391571,0.048877961933612823
Ebay,Want to share my experience about increasing my selling limits. Hopefully this can save you some time in the future.,"TL;DR If you have having a category limit, it must be increased instead of removed to have any effect. (maybe?)

I was doing my daily call as usual to try and connect with someone at eBay to increase my selling limits. To my surprise I only had to wait 30 minutes to get a hold of someone. It should be noted that this is the very first time I have ever gotten a hold of someone about raising my selling limits. 

The woman was very nice and helpful but when she looked at my account she couldn't see any limitations at all. Apparently there is a dollar amount limit that I hadn't reached and there is a listings limit that I hadn't reached yet. 

[This is the message I see when trying to make new listings](http://i.imgur.com/rTaSL6J.png)

I told her about this message and she said the only thing she can think of is a category limit is happening. She said she would check what she could do and call me back. She called me back 10 minutes later saying she was able to take care of the limit by removing it altogether. 

I told her I had another issue and she said she needed me to talk to a different department. Before she transferred me she said it would take 5-10 minutes for the limit to be removed, but it was definitely removed. 

I was transferred to seller support after waiting another 30 minutes and while he was working with me to fix another issue I noticed my limit hadn't been removed. He checked and noted that the limit had actually been removed and couldn't figure out why I was still seeing that message. He recommended I talk to account support and transferred me.

A quick hold later, I was talking to account support. He read to me the exact message I was seeing to confirm if that was it. It was. He said this is a category limit and he sees that it was removed but it's not possible to remove a category limit. Since she removed the limit, the moment I tried to make another listing the limit was put back on. He said the only remedy is talking to limits support again and having them increase my category limit instead of removing. If we didn't do that I would need to wait until the beginning of November to make more listings. 

By the way, I only have 12 listings right now. 

The account support person told me I needed to talk to limits support and that he could transfer me. He said the wait would be one hour plus to talk to someone again. 

So here I am on hold..still. I am just going off what he said. He might even be wrong. I could be holding for no reason at all.",4.0,1,2014-10-07,EBAY,0.05492524430155754,0.8992255330085754,0.045849237591028214

Ebay,Dealing with an eBay return...,"Hey folks! Hope you can help me out here.

I've been selling stuff on Ebay for a long while, and recently started offering returns (they sucked me in with the discounted fees.)

I recently sold what probably is the biggest ticket item I have ever sold-- A framed, signed poster of Derek Jeter. The transaction went smoothly, I shipped it through Ebay using Fedex, and everything seemed okay. However, just today, I received a message from the buyer asking for a refund. His reasoning, and I quote: ""This picture came wavy and does not fit in this frame. The edge was less than perfect..overall the picture was not in even good shape. It is wavy. Very disappointed for 610 dollars..""

The picture came exactly as is from Steiner Sports and is authenticated, and I definitely never took it out of the frame.
When I go to the return center, it only gives me three options-- Agree to the refund and pay for the return shipping, or let him keep it and give him his money back in full or partial. Obviously, none of these are a good choice for me. This seems like a big case of buyers remorse.

Is there are a way for me to get through this without having to accept the return? I've never dealt with any sort of return with eBay, and really am not in the mood to deal with someone backing out at the last second.

I can post the auction in question, I just don't want to break any rules in the subreddit.

Ebay,This guy is charging me 6% sales tax on his eBay item.,"I know I should have read it before bidding, but I ended up winning an auction for 1100 dollars on eBay early this morning.  
I go to checkout/pay for this, and I see a 6% AZ sales tax.  I live in Arizona and the seller is in West Virginia.  
Is he even allowed to charge me this?  It just seems like a sneaky way for him to get 6% more from his listing.  

Update:
I'm pretty new to reddit so here are some clarifications and updates.
One of the things that was a red flag to me was that he was collecting 6% sales tax across the board, all 50 states and Samoa, and D.C., etc... Even if he was legitimately collecting it for tax, I couldn't believe the 6% rate would apply to all states.
His eBay account has 317 positive transactions and no negatives since 2003. He does have an eBay store.
I asked about the sales tax and his reply was: ""Because I have to pay sales tax in WV.""

Ebay,"Believe my item i sent was stolen, buyer is claiming it wasn't delivered and was left outside in a recycling box.","Hello, i recently sold my PS3 on Ebay and the buyer was out and the delivery was failed the first time, he rearranged for thursday (today) but UPS decided they would delivery it yestarday and of course it failed again as he was out. They left a card to say it was left under his recycling box (even though the package is ALOT bigger and wouldn't fit) and coming home to find it wasn't there.

The delivery company was UPS and i arranged the delivery through interparcel, i had a cover of £500 (incase it was damaged, didn't think it was going to get stolen) but feel this is useless as it says to file a claim i need proof of value, and i no longer have the receipts for the console or games.

I'm now lost as what to do, as UPS say to contact interparcel, i did that and now there attempted to see where it was actually left.

I was wondering if this fails, is it possible to have the police involved and sony? i have my serial numbers and mac address on my phone as a photo, i know in the US you can have sony trace it if the console is stolen.

Ebay,Is my low-tech tamper evident tape worthwhile?,"I used to work in a warehouse where we'd receive boxes of merchandise sealed with ""tamper evident tape"" which merely consisted of tape with stripes on it.

I lay down one piece of tape, apply stripes across the gap, then lay down another piece on top -- staggered so I get maximum purchase with the tape.  My thinking is, it might prove someone opened a box that they claimed not to have opened.  

Does anyone else used tamper-evident tape?  If so, has it assisted you with winning a case or deterred unscrupulous buyers from pursuing a bogus case?

Ebay,No idea at what to value my ebay listing at + other questions from a potential first time seller on ebay.,"short back story is, I've never really used ebay much, I've been aware of it for ages, but never bothered with it, now I'm looking to offload my xbox 360 and a fair number of games, selling them individudally on amazon will take a while and I would rather just drop them all in one go.

my first question is how to know how much to charge? Its about 40 xbox games in good condition + a controller + cables + the black 250 slim + turtle beach headphones. What should I put as the starting bid + do I put a buy it now price? 

second question is how much does it hurt chances of selling when putting collection only? I don't have any boxes suitable for shipping that much stuff and was thinking about just doing collection only or will that put off too many people?

third question is will it sell and how long to leave it up for? Is there a limit/recommended length of time?

Ebay,FedEx did(n't) deliver?! Now what?,"Hopefully this is the correct subreddit. 

I have standing instructions with FedEx and UPS to deliver to my side door, as I've had an eBay package 'disappear' from my front door a few years ago.   Both UPS and FedEx have been exemplary about this, and delivery notification by email or text.   

I won an auction on eBay for around $350 for a recording device.   I paid with PayPal.   I gave the seller my FedEx number, and he shipped it out.   No problems yet. 

It's been a bit, and I haven't received my package.   After finding the tracking number, it was *allegedly* delivered on Tuesday, September 30th, *on the front porch*.   I didn't receive a package.  It was 'delivered' around 10:30a (usual time is around 6:30p), and my roommate was in and out all day (heck, I didn't leave the house until around 11:30a), and neither of us saw/heard/perceived a delivery person, a knock, *or* a package. 

What do I do from here?   Ideally, I'd like to get my item.   Failing that, I'd like to get a
 replacement, or my $350 + $11.85 shipping costs back. 


Help?   Please?

Edit/Follow Up:

FedEx *badly* misread the label, decided the misread address didn't exist (it didn't), and picked a somewhat close street with the misread house number on it, then dropped the package off, marking it delivered.   The own of the 'corrected' address was nice and told FedEx they mad a mistake.   FedEx picked the package up and shippd it to a FedEx store close to the address it was shipped from *originally*, and failed to update any records, websites, tracking information, etc, and failed to notify the sender or me. 

After talking with their 800# for about half an hour, I convinced someone to actually investigate, where they told me about the misdeliver and takeaway, but couldn't tell me where the package *was*, but were confident it was delivered either to a) the sender, b) the FedEx store it was shipped from, or c) another FedEx associated office somewhere in California, at exactly 2:58pm.

The seller was kinda enough to do a bit of legwork as well, and FedEx admitted to *him* they totally misread the address, and when they find the package they'll contact me to arrange shipping, which I *might* or *might not* have to pay for.   I was *assured* the that if I called their billing office, I'd be refunded my initial shipping expenses, minus fees.  :/

FedEx is usually pretty good to me, but ***damn***, when you are a global company with stuff moving everywhere, I suppose *any* screwup will *also* be global (or at least regional).

I received the item yesterday. Thanks for the fast shipping!
I carefully examined the Zune and found out that the earphone socket is working fine (very tight). This Zune has the following problems: very low audio output, audio distortions and very poor radio receptions. The most likely causes are the electronic components malfunctioned and some of the circuit boards need to be replaced. I'm not sure if I can fix it because the product is discontinued therefore parts are hard to find. I'd like to present two options for you to resolve this problems.

&gt;1) I'll keep this Zune as a future project if you could refund $30 to me.
2) I ship the Zune back to you.

&gt;I don't blame you for the problem since not everyone knows electronics. Please let me know your decision.

Ebay,Has anyone used the USPS/UPS flex label for returns and dropped the package off at a post office? A question about tracking.,"Hi all,

This is only my second eBay return, so I'm not really sure how it all works. On Monday eBay provided me a return label for an item that was not as described by the seller, and I dropped it off at the post office later that day. It stated ""accepted"" an hour or so after that but hasn't updated since. Their return policy said to return the package within seven days, and at this point I really can't see it making it there in time unless the package is currently in transit and just not updating. I've called the post office and they're attempting to locate it, and I've emailed eBay about the strictness of their return window, but I haven't heard back in over a day.

My questions are: a) Do USPS ""Return Service"" labels update before delivery, and b) Is eBay strict about their 7 day return window? I'm not sure what to do in this case, and assuming I don't receive a response in the next day or two I need to figure out the next course of action due to how expensive the item was.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Ebay,[Question] What is your experience with 'Second Chance Offer' or relisting,"*If you want to know the whole story, I'll post it below.*

What is your experience with offereing a second chance offer to a buyer who did not win an auction, but was the second (or whatever) highest bidder? I'm afraid if they refuse I would have to relist the item, and by doing that would it make me look 'fishy'. Any and all advice is very appreciated!
** **
**Full story**:

I'll first admit I'm new to the selling game. I just sold my second item to a buyer who made an account minutes before the auction ended. There were 27 bids in total with 9 different bidders. I received an automated email from Ebay saying that the buyer requested my information. Minutes later I received a text message on my phone stating the buyer was having difficulty making a payment, and wanted me to send them my Paypal ID. Now even though I'm new to selling though ebay, I know enough for that to raise a flag. So I called CS and they told me to contact the buyer, and if after 2 days they don't pay I can submit a report. I did contact the buyer and explained to them everything, and if they had trouble to contact CS. 

Now lets say hypothetically they don't pay and I have the option to make a second chance offer. Should I contact some of the other bidders and explain what is going on? What should I do if I have to relist the item? Should I explain on the item description what happened? I'm afraid of getting a lower selling price because the original bidders don't trust me, because I don't have the selling history to back me up. I do have 100% feedback, but that is from 5 buying items and 1 selling.

Ebay,How exactly do you pay for return shipping if you've opted to pay for it with returns?,"I accept returns on all of my listings, and on most I require the buyer to pay return shipping. However, since I sell a lot of high end designer clothing, where prices can reach in excess of $200 for something like a single shirt, on the more expensive items I offer to pay shipping on returns, as an incentive to attract more customers who otherwise might not be willing to spend $300 on a piece of clothing knowing they could lose $10-20 on shipping if it doesn't fit.

I recently accepted a return on an expensive men's suit that I had opted into paying shipping on. The guy was super nice and understanding and sent it back promptly. I issued his refund through ebay, and saw on the package that it cost him $13 to ship it back. I messaged him and told him I'd refund his shipping costs, but he has not responded.

At first I thought I'd send his paypal ID the $13 and call it a day, but his paypal ID isn't visible to me... Am I missing something?

I've searched and searched and haven't come up with any solid info. Is there a way in the future that I can just pay the shipping directly and send the buyer a label they can print off? Does ebay do this already? Is there a way the buyer can send me an invoice, since I can't see their paypal ID?

I just want to streamline the return process as much as possible. If one of my customers wants to return something, I want it to be an easy, positive experience for them in the end. Ideally, it'd be as easy as:

1. Suit arrives, doesn't fit, buyer requests a return.
2. I accept return, send him a prepaid shipping label.
3. He prints out the label, tapes it on the original box, sends it back.

Ebay,Me vs a dirty rotten scoundrel (I think),"I, stupidly, shipped an Xbox One game of Destiny without tracking (1st class Royal Mail). Surprise surprise the buyer hasn’t received the package and has opened a dispute against me. In our communications he has highlighted this is the fourth package that has gone missing off Ebay in the last six months!

Thought I’d google his Ebay name which leads to a www.raptr.com account, has his picture and everything. On this account it identifies his Xbox Live username, upon a search on http://www.xboxgamertag.com/ this username played Destiny last week, exactly when my package should have arrived.

I’m assuming Ebay wouldn’t care about any of this, as he could just say this isn’t him or that he played a friends copy? I’ve got until Friday to find a resolution, do I have a leg to stand on here, is there anything I can do that would make Ebay question his claim?

If I could find his Facebook account I could link his real name to the Raptr account. Alterntively I could present him with all the information I’ve gathered and ask for an explanation?

Edit - done some more sleuthing. Found his G+ and youtube account. The youtube is under his name and lists his Xbox live name.

Subject went to the buyer (the best, for the lack of evaluation). After some time, came a reminder of the negative account balance on ebay. And here the story is in full swing...

As you can see, my merchant account does not exist. There was nothing that would allow me to pay up online.

I was very desperate and I exchanged several emails with customer service, (In which persistently fails to understand that I do not like to pay by credit card because they simply do not have such options unlocked.)  before we came to the conclusion that nothing in me does not work. (chronology - half of August). I was asked to send a check to eBay - yea it is still twenty-first century. (Here's another story from my bank, for which I waited almost a month for the checkbook cheers). Somewhere between my account has been blocked completely.

In early September, I sent them a check. On the bank I saw a few days later: http://i.imgur.com/xHzYCqp.png
After a few more emails, where staff claimed ""we did not get your check"", they were able to find the check - at the end of September. I also got information that someone will contact me within two days and the problem will be solved. After more than a week, I allowed myself to send a reminder email:

There are lock-holes for security, but rather than complicate the issue I would most likely be using zip-ties rather than locks as a tamper-barrier in case it needs to be inspected at the Can/US border. Or is that too naive of me?

If I can avoid it, I would rather not have to re-box each case, not only because the cases are described as ""unbreakable"" but they seem as though they practically serve the same protective purpose that a box would if I were shipping any other item.

Ebay,i feel like im stuck in dispute pergatory,"I sold something on eBay 3 weeks ago. Sent flat rate with tracking, updated immediately with the tracking #. The guy I sold it to has 0 trades with eBay. 

The day it was marked delivered he opened a dispute saying he didn't receive it. 

He was very hostile saying he wanted a full refund and stopped replying to me. eBay stated if we didn't resolve the problem by the 3rd they'd close the dispute unless it was escalated. I told him since it was marked delivered to open a claim with USPS about the package and he didn't. 

Fast forward to the 5th.... Still not escalated, still not closed. I escalate it to have eBay decide since nothing's happening and there's a $130 hold on my Paypal account. I state that it was marked delivered, his verified EBay/Paypal address match up with the address I shipped to, and that he's unresponsive. eBay says to allow until the 12th to get in contact with the buyer **about the condition of the item he received** 

He has not responded to eBay regarding that message, and here we are a day after the decision date and I've heard nothing.

Ebay,International buyer requesting I re-ship package to alternate confirmed address after it couldn't be delivered to his home.

Because it's an international order, the buyer needs to pay customs duties (UPS told me I could not prepay these even if I wanted to, not sure if everyone has that policy).  I sent the item to the buyer's confirmed address, apparently his home.  He was not there to meet the delivery truck and, thus, did not pay the customs duties.  I then had to pay to have the package returned to me.

Buyer and I have been messaging, and he requested I re-ship to his office address.  I asked if it's confirmed through paypal, he says yes.  He also volunteered to pay the re-shipping price.

""What can we do about Ebay sellers charging way too much for items that we can find online cheaper than what they are asking?

I found them online $60 cheaper. seller wants 210 a piece for them meanwhile if you google them online I can purchase them from several diff vendors for 149.99.

Ebay,Help with an international buyer.,"Hi.  I'm a small time seller that just sold their second item overseas.  The item is a 39.00 article of clothing and we sold it to South Korea.

I understand this is more expensive for the buyer but we opted for it because frankly we don't know what we're doing.

**Is there anyway to remove her shipping charge and invoice her directly for the shipping cost in the way she is asking?**

Ebay,Rant about a crappy transaction,"I bought a guitar with aftermarket parts on Ebay. When I got it, it arrived with the parts removed, no strings because the parts were removed, and a cheaper model than the seller claimed.

I asked for the parts, and the seller said he would send them. I filed a case so that I could document this. I wanted a partial refund for the value difference between the instrument that he claimed he had and what I was sent as well as the aftermarket part.

Ebay honored in my favor and wanted me to return the item at my cost.

I called and said that was unreasonable, as I would be out the cost of shipping for someone else's mistake. They said they would send me a label. I asked them to send it via message, they said they would.

Two weeks later, I come back from a work trip and no label. The case has closed. I call Ebay and the first person tells me, before doing anything with the case, it needs to be reopened.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/2irble/believe_my_item_i_sent_was_stolen_buyer_is/

TL:DR Buyer claiming item was left at front door on a re-arranged delivery day when he wasn't in, got home and item wasn't where the failed attempted card said it was.

But now i've run into a new problem. After talking to interparcel, kind people of reddit and asking Ebay what i should do (and mailing tracking information to prove delivery) i had messages from the buyer about an update and also stating ""still no item or no money"" this left me to believe he wanting nothing but his money, and also made my suspicion of him trying to scam me higher.

I then messaged him saying i was calling the police and was told to contact sony and get mac address traced. He then messaged me the same day asking if there was an update on my claim and also can he have the mac address, i ignored the message (seeing as he hasn't really ""owned"" the ps3 giving the mac address would be silly).

2 days later, today, he sent a message which made me and my partner laugh. He said he arrived home and found a box under his recycling bin and has seen so far the ps3 is inside and will check later to make sure it's all there. 

The problem i have now i believe he will try and scam me again by saying not all the items are in the box, or claim it's damaged. I wasn't sure what to write back besides saying it's great news and asked for a reply when he has checked it and also was the box opened or tempered with at all.

What should i do next? I feel he will try the above and claim it was either damaged or part(s) missing.

Update: Just got another message from him saying its ""hard to tell as i dont know how you package it did you use selotape"" i knew he would try and say it was damaged/parts lost anyways. I havn't replied to the message just now sure what to do now as i knew he would try do this. The thing is he's apprently only had the box for 24 hours but during all that time he still hasn't bothered to check to make sure it's all there? first thing i do when i get a package is check to make sure all of it's there.

Okay so a little backstory: I went to the Blizzard World Wide Invitational event in 2008. They gave out goody bags with a lot of worthless stuff, except for one thing: a card with a code for an unannounced beta test and a code for a world of warcraft 'ingame pet'.

If that last bit doesn't make any sense to you it's something like [this](http://img.bubblesofmischief.com/2013/07/Mini-Tyrael1.jpg)
Now, I didn't think much of it at the time since I've never really cared about WoW, but it seems like this is worth quite some money to a lot of people:

http://www.wowtcgloot.com/tyrael_pet.htm

I cant add ebay links so just look for 'Mini tyrael pet' on ebay

Now, my problem is: I've scratched off the protective coating that covered both codes. I only used the beta code though, and apparently the pet codes don't expire. So! How do I make sure people don't think this is fishy? Should I ask a lower price because of this? Nobody cares about that beta key anyway (that one is expired) so it's basically the same product. Will I be fine if I just clearly mention that it's been scratched but never used?

Also - is it required by ebay that I actually send a physical item? Or can I just scan it and transfer it over a secure connection?
I just wanna cover all bases here. This thing is a little miracle, I'm struggling to pay rent so I'm super happy to catch a lucky break!",11.0,2,2014-10-17,EBAY,0.0400526262819767,0.9296833276748657,0.030264059081673622
Ebay,Questions about weird tracking info on Global Shipping Program order,"Sorry for the confusing title, this is a strange problem. I sold a few expensive orders (~$800). I sold two recently through the global shipping program. Two separate buyers to the same country. These two items were shipped at the same time so they should be arrive at similar times. Anyways the first order had no problems, it went to the shipping center and has almost arrived to its global destination. The second order has been very strange. The tracking info never updated on ebay, when I click the tracking number it still says [this](http://imgur.com/LLQc9Zy). But when I dig deeper I see [this](http://imgur.com/72RaZ9V). This tells me that it reached the global shipping center about 8 days ago. It should have been shipped to the international destination by now. I am getting worried that they may have lost the item. Has anyone experienced this before? I contacted ebay but they have been very slow in getting back to me. I cant call because I am out of the country. If anyone has experienced something similar could you help. Also, if the package was lost it will be on ebay correct? The package made it to their center but I have not heard anything else.

Ebay,Warning to iPhone 6 seller,"Hi everyone.

I just wanted to send a quick warning to anyone looking to sell their iPhone 6 on eBay.

I'm a top-rated seller that consistently sells iPhones, iPads, and iPods.

So far with the iPhone 6, I've listed 3 of them in the past two weeks.
Out of these 3, two were scammers - they either stole someones PayPal information or fraudulently claimed ""unauthorized"" after I shipped.

Just a tip - always use signature confirmation when selling if its over $250 - I did that and I was covered.

Luckily PayPal's seller protection isn't bad and they actually covered me so Im not really out any money but it's sucks having your funds on hold.

So far eBay sends me a message like 2 days after the transaction has been shipped telling me the buyer is a scammer etc and then later on I either get a chargeback or unauthorized claim etc.    

Good luck",7.0,11,2014-10-17,EBAY,0.058975160121917725,0.9045068025588989,0.036518000066280365

I have a negative from a client claiming that he made a return, that we did not received it and that he has never been refunded. 

I have never had a message from this particular buyer or any type of case opened and I have no idea what is he talking about.

Does this kind of feedback qualifies for a removal?

Ebay,Why can't I leave negative feedback for a seller's canceled purchase?,"I purchased an item on eBay and promptly paid through PayPal. The seller contacts me and tells me they are canceling the purchase. They issue a refund in PayPal. I did not approve the cancellation, but the case was automatically closed by eBay after the refund was issued. 

However, I wanted the item I purchased. If I can't cancel my bid as a buyer without consequence, a seller shouldn't be able to cancel a sale without consequence either. I left negative feedback. The seller has the negative feedback removed. I can't find anything that says my leaving negative feedback is against eBay policy. 

Thoughts? I want sellers to know that there are consequences to canceling purchases. Otherwise, what's to stop them from canceling a purchase where they didn't get as much as they wanted? I know there's a magic black box system that keeps track of large numbers of canceled purchases, but I want there to be public record of it (in the form of negative feedback).",7.0,3,2014-10-18,EBAY,0.24778996407985687,0.7316542863845825,0.020555751398205757

Ebay,Would it be beneficial for me to get Ebay involved in this case? I'm the seller.,"Hello! Quick little story about a case that a buyer filled with me. 

I was selling masks for Halloween and sold one to the Buyer during mid September. I print &amp; ship from Ebay every time, always tracking, and these masks were going Priority or First Class. The first mask gets to him no problem. 

A couple weeks later I get another purchase of the same kind of mask by the same Buyer. I send it out using the same method, seemingly no problem. Days later Buyer files a case against me(don't you hate when they don't message you first!?) saying that although the tracking says it was delivered he never received anything and that he needs it by the 23rd. I think 'mistakes happen' and offer to send out a new mask free with me paying shipping with signature confirmation. The SC was me trying to protect myself, I ask him about it first. Buyer agrees stipulating he needs it by the 16th now. He says he'll take down the case after he receives it by that date.  Okay sure. We've had pretty good communication so far.

I send out a new mask 2 day priority. Following the tracking, it gets to him on the 16th but no one is home to sign for it. It's ""Notice Left (No Authorized Recipient Available)"". I message him about it politely asking for the case to be dismissed since it arrived by the date specified. I haven't heard anything since before I shipped it out. According to the tracking, he still hasn't picked it out.

My question, do I ask Ebay to step in? Do I let the case expire? I don't want to be held accountable when, I feel, that I went above and beyond to help this customer. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

TDLR USPS loses an item maybe. Buyer opens case. I send out a new one priority. Buyer wasn't home, item at post office. Now I got this case just sitting here masturbating. Help?

Ebay,"Sold an iPhone 6 on eBay, buyer requests return, I accept and they send me a faulty iPhone 4 in the post, which they are denying and demanding their money back. What can I do?","Dearest Redditors, long time lurker but I would really like some advice.

I sold a new iPhone 6 128GB (locked to EE network) on eBay UK, listed it and it sold fairly quickly. Buyer paid quickly so I posted the item later that day.

Shortly after I marked 'dispatched' I receive a message from the buyer explaining that they made a mistake and did not read the item description. They would be unable to use the phone as it is locked to the wrong network, and that I shouldn't send it.

Obviously the item was on its way but I was willing to accept the iPhone back provided it remained unopened and the package unopened. They thanked my understanding and requested a return which I accepted.

Item arrived two weeks ago, open the package and the vile human has put a faulty iPhone 4 inside an iPhone 5S box and kept my iPhone 6.

The mail had to be signed for but I didn't check the contents until after signing.

I quickly told him that I received the wrong item but he is denying this and is demanding the money to be refunded, saying that I am in fact the scammer.

Now currently he has not escalated a case despite my insistence as I'm unable to.  Reading online it seems that eBay usually always rules in favour of the buyer and will not consider evidence in most cases.

Ebay,"A buyer is requesting a return and making claims which I believe are false. Unfortunately, the situation's complicated. What recourse do I have as a seller to protect myself?","This is gonna be long one. Let me explain.

Recently, a popular electronic artist released a very limited edition vinyl box set for which there were only 200 copies made in the world.

Given the extremely limited nature of the item and that it's meant to be a collectors item, its value lies solely in it being unopened and undamaged. Because of this, I never opened the original shipping container it came in. Instead, when I received it from the distributor I slapped a new package slip on the box and sent it insured directly to the buyer. 

Unfortunately, that buyer is now asking for a return. He claims that he received the package damaged and that it ""showed signs of being opened prior to delivery"", the latter claim being patently false. He filed a return stating the item ""doesn't match the listing description"" and he wants his money back, which I declined to process. My only guess is he'll file a claim with eBay arbitration, which will likely happen in three days.

As the seller in this situation I'm highly aware that I'm already at a disadvantage. However, as I said, the situation is complicated. The following are a few facets of the transaction that might give you a better idea of the situation. Note that not all of these facets are in my favor.

* The item was unopened when shipped as stated in the listing description, but the buyer also explicitly requested I not open the original shipping container I received the item in. Since I could not verify the product was undamaged when I received it, I can make no guarantee of the quality of the product.
* Since I cannot guarantee the quality of the product, I have no proof of where the damage occurred. It may have occurred during shipment to me, or during shipment to the buyer. Potentially, the damage may have occurred after the buyer received the item, though I have no way to verify.
* This buyer mentioned to me before buying that he had originally purchased a different copy of this item but received that one defective. As a seller without proof of the original quality of my item's package contents as stated above, in the case of a return, how am I to know that the buyer wouldn't send the defective product back to me, thus profiting at my expense?
* Given that this is a collectors item and its value is inherently linked to being unopened, the fact the buyer opened it significantly decreased its value. In the event of a return, I'd be forced to bear the cost of the buyer causing the product to decrease in value.
* I took no pictures of the package upon receiving it from the distributor and before shipping it to the buyer. This is my fault. However, by some twist of fate this happens to be the second one of these products I've sold as I won the distributor's lottery twice. I do have pictures of the first item in its original shipping container, of which the copy in question looked nearly identical. 
* I handled both copies of the item in the same way, both with the original shipping container unopened and shipped to the buyer with no extra packaging. The first copy shipped to its buyer overseas and made it there without incident. That copy garnered me good feedback and is in my seller history.
* That said, the buyer of the copy in question requested I put an extra box around the original shipping container which I did not do. Since I was both paying for shipping myself and had a successful transaction with the previous copy of the item, I shipped it in the same fashion as the first, unopened, using the same shipping container as I received it, the same carrier and the same shipping method.

Given all the above, especially the fact that that the product was shipped unopened by buyer request and that my listing description mentioned the product as unopened, I don't believe I should be responsible for any damage to the product. As well, I don't believe I should bear the cost of the buyer decreasing its value by opening it. Some questions:

* Should the buyer have reported damage to the shipping container before opening the package? 
* Do I have any leverage being the seller in this case, given that I have no pictures of the item nor pictures of the item's shipping container in their original condition? 
* Does my previous successful transaction handled in the same way help my credibility?  
* Lastly, assuming eBay arbitration rules force me to process the return, will I be forced to accept a product that is now inherently less valuable?

This is a rather unfortunate turn of events. Any help you can provide would be extremely appreciated.",4.0,2,2014-10-20,EBAY,0.15533338487148285,0.8114277124404907,0.033238865435123444
Ebay,Problem selling camera on eBay,"I sold my DSLR back in September, as I had a number of big bills coming up, and knew I wouldn't get a chance to shoot with it again till spring anyway - when I hope to be able to buy a new one. This was not a small decision for me, as it was my only camera and one of the more valuable things I own.

Now the problem came when the buyer received the camera and told me that it was giving an error message and not working for her. I work in the photo industry and I know the camera was tested and working when it was sent out, and I packed it safely, myself.

In the interest of a good transaction i offered to pay for a repair shop if the quote was a reasonable amount. She said she brought it in and they said they thought they could fix it - however, she gave me no price quote. I followed up to ask about it, but was told that since she ""hadn't heard from me"" she was going to escalate the case to eBay.

I continued to try to communicate but didn't hear back. a couple weeks later she opened a return for the item. Since she is not communicating I escalated it to a case with eBay.

Now I'm afraid of eBay finding against me, and being stuck refunding money I can't afford to lose, and having a damaged item returned to me with no way of knowing what actually happened to it.

What is my best course of action here? Is there anything I can do at this point to protect myself from that situation or to help the resolution in my favor?",3.0,6,2014-10-21,EBAY,0.06224784627556801,0.8799592852592468,0.057792890816926956
Ebay,What is wrong with Ebay's tracking and validation statistics?,"I have two separate issues:

1. Items showing as not validated. Four items are showing as ""No scan recorded."" Three were shipped on 9/14 and one on 10/14.  All four items were scanned at the post office or by the mail carrier and were reported as delivered by USPS.

2. Items showing as tracking not uploaded within tracking time.  I have two items where the buyer paid very late at night. I am on on Eastern Time.  

One package was paid for on 7/7 at 11:20PM PST. That's 7/8 here. Handling time stated as one day. Tracking was uploaded on 7/9 at 8:30 PST (maybe that one was late, can't remember the cutoff time).

Second package was paid on 9/8 @ 8:45PST. That's 11:45PM here. From my understanding, that should be considered as 9/9. Tracking was uploaded on 9/12 @ 2PM PST.  Handling time stated 3 days.

Ebay,"I just got this question about a BIN dress with best offer available i have listed. I don't even know how to respond, but I find it a little annoying. What would you guys say?","""Hi my mom want to know what is the lower price for this dress, she love this one even is not her size , she will need to fix it, thank you god bless"" 

My knee jerk reaction is that this would be a nightmare buyer, because they've already decided something is wrong with the dress, they don't like the reasonable price i'm asking to begin with (which is fine- make me an offer) I just see this being a bad buyer

In any case, I don't understand how a buyer would expect me to do their haggling for them. I'm annoyed.

ugh. lol. :) i just responded ""This is a beautiful dress, I'm sure your mother would love it. You're more than welcome to make an offer. Thanks so much! "" there seems to be a ton of interest in the dress already so I'm not particularly worried about it selling.

""Oh no I don't know to much about this , if you just said a price I tell her, and we can make the purchase right now, thanks""

seriously? i know you have bought on ebay before- i can see you've been a member for **11** **years** what a crock

""I'm offering it for 14.99 which is a great price for this brand and quality dress. This is a new listing and I'm unlikely to accept a lower offer unless it does not sell closer to the end of the listing.

Ebay,I feel like I'm being defrauded by a foreigner. What can I do?,"American here from East Coast. I lost my job back in August. Haven't had luck finding work so I hang around the thrift stores to see if there's anything good for flipping. 

I bought an (100% can be verified) authentic mink fur coat on the Labor Day 50% off sale. I listed it on eBay with a starting bid of $50. I said in the listing that I do not offer refunds. 

The highest bidder was a Ukranian immigrant living in NYC. She paid $215 for it. Mind you I had 0 feedback and my account was brand new when I listed the coat. I mailed the coat within the same hour that she paid. I live right across the street from the post office. She and I both gave positive feedback after she received the coat. 

Next day I got an email with no explanation as to why she wanted a refund. She has poor English, but she said something like ""i want my mon bak."" I explained the auction stated no refund. I reported to Paypal. 

3 weeks or a month or so went by. No reply from coat lady so I thought all was well. Took her money out of my PP and put them towards my credit card bills. The other day I got an email saying she filed a PayPal claim. I replied to it and told PayPal I would not give her a refund. Now I am waiting to receive the coat, but even so I do not feel it is fair to have to give her a refund. Not because I don't have the money and am sad to have to re-add the debt back to my credit card, but because I feel it unfair. What can I do?

Ebay,Positive eBay Support Post [Seller],"I feel a buyer was trying to scam me on an item I sold them.  They waited almost the complete 60 days to request a return on an item they claimed that was damaged during shipment.

**Story:** I received a return request from a buyer last night stating the following about a drinking glass they had purchased: ""I just received this item.  Upon opening it I discovered that it was damaged during shipping.  I can send you pictures.  I am requesting a complete refund without returning the item since return shipping costs just don't make any sense.""

The item was purchased on 8/24/14 and tracked delivered on 8/27/14.  Yesterday was 10/20/14, 52 or so days after it was delivered.  I believed they were out to get a full refund and keep the glass.  Heck they might have dropped it themselves.  Buyer has 195 feedback.

I call customer support to ask them how they would like me to proceed.  I told them I believed it was somebody trying to get a refund for no reason.  They specifically stated in their return they just received the item, although the USPS states they've had it almost 2 months.  The eBay representative quickly told me to decline the return, not to leave any comment as to why I was declining the return, and to not worry about any negative feedback from the buyer as eBay has my back.

I got a message from the buyer asking if I'd be refunding them.  I'm giving them the silent treatment.

REPLY 2: can you please specify your intentions, first you messaged me that you are opening an insurance case with the shipping provider and then you send me a return item request. i saw your comment on the return item request and the item was carefully packaged loose with the bubble wrap like that so it would not cause pressure on the fragile parts.

Other established redditors could forward a list of blocked ebay user names, and the moderator could compile a comprehensive listing. 

Less established redditors could forward a list, but the list of names are not automatically added in order to prevent misuse.

Ebay,"eBayer wants to buy item now instead of bidding, not sure how to proceed","I was emailed by a potential buyer for an item I am selling and they messaged me saying they want to buy it for $50 (bids are currently at $20, I don't expect much more than $40 or so)  ASAP.

Ebay,The Global shipping program center shipped my purchase to the WRONG ADDRESS and Ebay doesn't want to help?!,"At the end of August, I purchased an item on ebay. I am canadian and the seller is located in the USA.

Anyhow, he shipped my package, a somewhat rare comicbook that was going to be a gift to my father. Weeks passes and still no comic books. I check on my tracking and it turns out it had been delivered.. TO ANOTHER HOUSE IN MY CITY?!

I contact the seller, he gets madly pissed off and says he shipped on the address provided by paypal/ebay, in KENTUCKY. I'm like what the heck? I investigate and it turns out that he shipped to the GSP Warehouse to have it reshipped to my home in Canada. The guy was legit.

I bought hundreds of items on ebay and NEVER had a problem, I buy expensive arcade boards from Japan and I never changed my address or any details in a DECADE+ on my ebay and paypal account.

Anyhow I open a claim with ebay for never having received the item in question (this is my first time doing this) and it somehow turned into a claim against the seller. 

The seller emailed me back asking me what was going on, how come I wanted my money back, and that he had done nothing wrong.. Obviously, in a way, he was right. But Somewhere along the way, the item was shipped to the wrong postal code.

Ebay wrote me back in a few hours saying they had ruled in favor of the seller and that it was a closed case.

The tracking number provided by ebay SHOWS that the package was shipped TO THE WRONG POSTAL CODE. It went to another house in my own city. 

I contacted twice ebay about this, but It seems that they are avoiding the question. A chat rep even said that a supervisor would contact me and nothing has happened.  I am being ignored? I've searched around and found posts  and youtube vids of people with similar problems.

I work in support, and I just don't understand how it can be complicated to sort out my issue. THey have access to my account, they can see the messages exchanged between me and the seller, they can see there was no foul play. I don't understand why it's an issue.

I'm out of 50$, I never got the gift for my father, and the comic book is lost.  I'm out of ressources and I don't know what to do.I can't blame the seller, he did his part of the deal.. It's that damn GSP center that screwed up.

Ebay,Difficult situation in Brazil,"I just need a bit of advice on what to do. I'm not sure where else to ask since eBay is more relevant to my question. 
Anyways, my father sold some electronic equipment to a person from Brazil. At first he was hesitant on selling the item to him because well..he's located in Brazil and was pretty insistent on purchasing the item. Then he sold it to him and shipped it out with tracking through FedEx International Econ. Delivered to Brazil in 4 days but is going through customs. 
Fast forward 1.5 months later the item is still stuck at customs or a broker. I have been through several calls with FedEx and they can't do anything about it. There was paperwork to be done but that has been completed through a broker with the receiver. 
Now the wait...the item is supposed to be let through customs because everything is completed. There's nothing else they need to do, but they haven't even released it or the broker is holding onto the package and the receiver has not even responded to any of the eBay messages I have sent him. He then filed a dispute through Paypal for not receiving the item. Well I kept telling him to check tracking and call the broker..He doesn't listen. Several messages later and a call to Paypal there is nothing I could do at the moment. 

My father does not want to be at a loss with money. He doesn't want the package to go missing or to be shipped back because it would be at his cost. FedEx ain't going to ship it back free since it costed ~$400 to ship to Brazil. 

Why is it taking so long be release in Brazil ? What is the broker for ? What should I do to help my father? He doesn't want any negative feedback on his account as well. 
Btw the reason why I am helping my father is because English is not his first language.",8.0,2,2014-10-24,EBAY,0.06996701657772064,0.8991250395774841,0.03090798296034336

Ebay,Need advice on potential scammer.,"So as many of you saw, I posted a thread about the iPhone 6 scammers on eBay.  

So far, PayPal/eBay has protected me on the claims so I continue to sell.

Anyways this recent sale is a bit tricky and is a new type of scam - I suppose.

So I sold an iPhone 6 to a buyer and shipped to the confirmed address - I printed the label using eBay's shipping service.

Apparently it didn't arrive in time for him or something - He said he wants his money back.  He didn't ask me to ship it overnight or anything and even if he did I wouldn't have to comply unless I agreed to it. (I specified 2 day handling and shipped using priority mail just as stated).  He purchased the item and never contacted me - then like a few days later he said he wants his money back.   

The reason the phone didn't arrive is because of this - Apparently when we checked the tracking # it says that its ""forwarded.""  He claims its coming back to my address but nothing has happened in the last few days and USPS won't help.  

Googling tells me that he requested the post office to forward all mail received to that address to be routed to his new address.  

PayPal tells me I'm not covered unless I can prove that he submitted the forwarding request. 

So now I'm stuck.  My $800 is on hold, PayPal won't help - USPS won't help - and this guy pretty much scammed me.

Any advice on what to do?   

Also, the buyer is accusing me of not putting down the apartment # but I did since I shipped through eBay by printing a label.

To top it off, eBay sent me one of those messages saying that I shouldn't ship the phone and stuff and they banned the buyer - but this happened like 4 days after the listing ended!",6.0,2,2014-10-24,EBAY,0.06507541984319687,0.9107664227485657,0.024158092215657234

Ebay,Ebay's New 'Money Back Guarantee' REALLY Screws the seller.,"I recently sold a pair of earrings. Accepted a best offer for $5. Buyer didn't pay for 4 days, and automatic Unpaid Buyers Assistance opened a case on day 2 of that. Buyer finally paid, and I shipped. Customer received the product on Oct 22. Today, I receive a message saying the buyer wants to open a return case because they are not as described. Here is what they wrote:

&gt; These earrings are not as described in the picture. The are so little you have to have a magnifying glass to see what you see in the picture. 

They are also upset that they didn't arrive in a box, but rather on an earring card. This is standard for us, and out of the ~80 sets of earrings we have sent out, has never been a problem. 

So, to the point, eBay only gives you 3 options now. 

&gt; Accept the return:
&gt; You'll pay for return shipping and can send our return label or send your own. Wait to get the item back before you refund the buyer.

&gt; Refund the buyer:
&gt; The buyer will keep the item, and you can fully refund the buyer to close this request.

&gt; Offer a partial refund:
&gt; The buyer will keep the item, and you have one chance to offer an amount.

Now, we state in our listings that we don't accept returns. Our pieces are either custom made, vintage, or antique. The problem is, everything is exactly as it was supposed to be, but she is upset about the size. You can clearly see the size of the earrings in the photo, based on the post and butterfly. We take all closeups of our products so people can see details.

I think he has swapped out old cartridges for the new ones and is trying to get them for free. I always video myself packaging and sealing anything I sell on eBay. If I sent that video to eBay confirming the contents of the package, would it trump his pictures or is it a lost cause at this point?

Ebay,eBay Is No Longer A Safe Marketplace,"I'm looking for sellers who have had a recent uptick (past 60-days) in fraudulent returns and cases. I successfully moved 80% of my business off the site back at the beginning of September, but based on my recent experiences that remaining 20% is more dangerous/stressful than ever. 

I think this is a combination of buyers becoming aware of the holes in the system along with recent policy changes. The upcoming 180-day PayPal buyer protection change is really going to be a test for me.

Just to give a stat that kind of reflects my statements, I was at a 1.0% defect rate in August and am now at 1.4% with no real change in how I ship or my items sold.

Ebay,Advice needed. Buyer with no feedback on BIN item.,"I buy and sell sporadically on Ebay. I have used the service since, basically it's inception.

That being said, over the past year, I have acquired quite a bit of cosmetics that I have been reselling and doing quite well at. I was even considering a side business. 

Being that I have been quite active in the past and have been protected in the past on fraudulent buyers, I was a bit in the dark about the staggering seller changes going on.

Normally, I list items as BIN. I had a few very inexpensive items that were not selling that I listed as auctions (excuse my naïveté about this). Much to my surprise, I'm suddenly dealing with nonpayers, getting paid upto 11 days later (?!?) and no recourse via the feedback/report changes. One buyer has literally left negative feedback for every item they have bought from other sellers in the past few months. I am just counting the minutes until I get mine.

I started researching here (thanks for all the info, everyone) and have appropriately become a little paranoid. I mean, I've been using Ebay on and off since around 1996/97 and had never experienced such a thing until October this year. I have considered moving to Amazon, but, when grossing less than $200 a month, I am concerned about investing the $30 a month to upgrade there.

Aptly, yesterday, I had a purchase on a BIN item for $25 from a buyer with a precarious looking username (doesn't seem like a guest account) and no feedback. In the past, I kind of jumped on working with no feedback buyer/seller situations, wanting to give a good experience to create rapport, etc. 

Now, I am wary- which I understand is partially my own paranoia. I understand my risks of losing out with cosmetics on returns- if it's open, lose/lose. But, I also don't want to fall head first into a scam that's raising red flags for me. Especially with the sudden crazy uptick of these out of control buyers.

Would it be advisable to refund the purchase on the item and let ebay know I am suspicious due to various reasons? Canceling the order leaves me open to NFB from the buyer, no? Should I bite the bullet and ship the item, hoping I'm just being paranoid? I would appreciate some guidance.

I normally never gave this a thought as I have dealt with 2 scam buyers over the past 2 years and ebay/paypal has protected me from some shady acts. But, from the research I have been doing, it doesn't seem like this is happening anymore. My feedback is also under 200 but swiftly increasing, it would be quite a blow to receive any NFB on a 11 year old UN with 100% positive, especially when I just started doing so well.",4.0,1,2014-10-27,EBAY,0.10660753399133682,0.8668394088745117,0.02655302919447422

Ebay,"Could someone explain the ""Updates to automatic relist on November 6"" email?","On Oct 27, I received this email stating that there will be more changes to the relist features on eBay. I'm already bothered that the free automatic relist has been moved from 3 free relistings to only 1. Now, I'm not sure, this email says that the 1 automatic relisting won't even be free (it'll take up one of the allotted free listings that I'm allowed?).

Here is the email text:

&gt; As a seller who has taken advantage of our automatic relist feature, we are writing you today to inform you of recently-announced changes, which take effect next month:
Starting November 6, items relisted via the automatic relist feature will count towards your monthly allotment of free listings*. Once your allotment of free listings is used up—or if the relisted item does not qualify for free listing—the standard insertion fee of 30¢ per listing will apply, as well as any optional feature fees.
Starting later this year, the automatic relist feature will no longer be available for 1- and 3-day duration listings.
The automatic relist feature currently relists an unsold item once. Starting November 6, if you are opted-in to this feature, your item will automatically be relisted up to two times.
Note: You will be credited—either via your free listings allotment or on your invoice—for insertion fees for these relistings where the free automatic relist feature was selected prior to November 6. The manual relisting policy will still apply.
When listing an item, be sure that the automatic relist option is either checked or unchecked, depending on your preference. Note that before choosing this option, you may want to check the Selling section of My eBay for any personalized recommendations to improve your listings.
As always, thank you for selling on eBay.

Ebay,I resell second hand items and it's about half my income. How do I take it to the next level?,"Currently I go to a handful of thrift stores and visit the flea market once a week. I've purchased a handful of storage units during auctions and also win items at auction to resell. I also go to estate sales/ yard sales if interesting.

I make a comfortable $1k-$2k a month in profit with maybe 15-20 hours a week when you add up the searching for items, listing them and shipping them. I've done about 600 transaction in the past year, grossing $30k in sales.

However, how do I go to the next level? What IS the next level? I've tried to think of ways to get people under me that I pay to do the searching etc. I think if I can cut out the searching and somehow get the items to come to me, I'd be sitting pretty. I just don't know how.

Ebay,Having difficulty with shipping to China and Malaysia,"I run an eBay business (under the guidance of my more experienced father) selling collectible stamps from around the world. I've been doing this for several months.

A not insignificant number of my shipments to China and Malaysia mysteriously get lost in the mail. I always ask international buyers to wait at least a month before requesting a refund to allow time for the mail to arrive. I find it extremely difficult to believe, however, that 30% of mail to China and Malaysia doesn't arrive.

But due to eBay's buyer protection policies, I feel I have no choice but to issue the refund. If the value of the lots is $50+, I send them via registered mail whether the buyer is willing to pay the extra cost or not (unsurprisingly, a number of them aren't). But all the refunds from the smaller lots are adding up.

Ebay,Customer bought wrong product,"Hi, I am relatively new to ebay but have come across a problem with a buyer.

I sold an Xbox Power Supply for an Xbox 360 Arcade. The unit was in perfect working condition, was clean, had no knicks or cracks or anything like that. 

The person who bought it has just messaged me and said that it doesn't connect to their Xbox because the model for their Xbox has a different shaped Power Port than what my power supply is compatible with. They want to know if I can simply trade a different one in.

Two problems with that: 1) I don't have another type of Power Supply. 2) I don't want to be losing out on money by paying for shipping for another one out to this customer even if I could find one. 

What is the best way to go about this? My listing was perfectly fine and the customer bought it. I am afraid that if I refuse a trade then I will get boned out of the sale because eBay may take the customer's side if they accuse me of selling an item that has a problem with it (I.E. lying about it).

Ebay,eBay Claims no Liability/Responsibility for Return Shipments...,"I am the seller in a case where the buyer requested a return due to a malfunction with the product I sold to them.  The buyer provided photos with clear indication of the described malfunction and I initiated the return process.  For ease, I opted to use an eBay shipping label.  I received the item and upon inspection, found physical damage that was not evident in the before mentioned photos, that the buyer claims to not have caused, and completely breaks the item (worthless).

Attempted to pursue a USPS claim for damage, but two problems: 

1. Claim form requires shipping charges and insurance amount, both of which I don't have due to how the label was generated 
2. Tracking information states there is $50 (standard) insurance on the item - the eBay selling price was $355. 

Neither the buyer nor I know any of the information for issue #1, and for issue #2, neither the buyer nor myself was ever notified about/prompted for additional insurance when sending or receiving the eBay shipping label!

I called eBay customer support, had the issue escalated to an eBay specialist and explained my situation.  I was told the following:

1. For any open cases where returns are concerned, after the return is received by the seller, eBay will side with the buyer, close the case, and initiate a refund.
2. eBay is not responsible for shipping issues and to work with the buyer and/or shipper.
3. As a seller in this situation, I should accept this issue as a loss.

I stated that eBay should be liable given there was no option presented to the buyer or seller add insurance.  I requested to have my statement of liability noted in my open eBay case and was told ""I will not add your statement to the case, have a nice day"" &lt;click&gt;.

Ebay,After months I still hasn't recived item from Top Seller! Please help!,"I immediately apologize for the long post and for my bad grammar (I'm italian and I know my english isn't the best) but this is quite a long story.

**I would like to note that all our conversations have been screen saved by me and that I still have all the e-mails from this seller.**

On 09/07/2014 I purchased a couple of plushes from a International Seller (11164 - 99,8% positive feedbacks)from America. Those plushes (a blue one and a multy colored version of the same) where not avaible in my country or Europe since where exclusive merchandise from SDCC 2014. 

During the convention (26/07/2014) I've recived a mail from the seller warning me that Blizzard (the brand producing the plushes) couldn't release in time the multy-colored version. The seller asked me what I wished to do with my order and I told him that I would prefer to wait for the release of the other version for the shipping (I was trying to be kind and not cause him troubles etc.).

On August 18 I've messaged him asking if he had any news and he confirmed me that still the multy-colored version wasn't release.

After almost 2 months (Oct 7) being a bit preoccupied by the fact the he never contacted me back I've sended him 2 messages asking him what was going on with my purchase. He answered to the second message (since I pointed out that I knew by watching at the merchandise on his shop that he would attend to NYCC 2014) telling me this: 

*Hi, I am looking into this right now to see what happened. Both Faerie Dragons were purchased for you. I am trying to locate them and if they were sent already with confirmation. I will get back to you!*

Apparently, by reading the message, he purchased both plushes so I was kinda ok with that and i waited patiently for him to send me some news regarding my purchase.

As you guys probably figured out... He didn't send me any news, so I tryed to contact him with 3 different messages during this days. I recived 0 answers back so right now I'm really really in a bad mood.
I'm both sad and frustrated since I trusted this seller and he's ignoring me. I've spend 150€ for a present and I don't know where my purchase is nor I know if I'll have my money back.

My problem here is simple, if he shipped my order he should have some sort of bill that can confirm that the shipping was done (it's all I'm asking for) but he's ignoring me and he's refusing to cooperate with me to find a solution so we can both be happy.



What I'm asking you guys here is simple... Is there anything I can do?
Can Paypal help me (I saw a guy post today about 2 chargebacks from 1 year ago so this seems my only solution)? 

I would really be glad if you guys can give me some advice since as of right now I really don't know what to do.

All of them showed up on tracking about 3-6 hours later. Yesterday I dropped off two packages at around 11:30 AM. I put them in the drop boxes like I normally do. One of the packages showed up on tracking at maybe 7:00 PM but the other one still says ""Pre-Shipment Info Sent to USPS."" I'm a bit worried since this was the more expensive item of the two ($120).

Ebay,Should you leave negative feedback for bad sellers? (Also update from the crappy Birkenstocks/item not as described post),"I recently posted about these Birkenstock sandals I bought on eBay that were in real shitty condition: http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/2jmmad/item_not_as_described_pics/  
 I shot the seller a message explaining that I wanted a refund and I waited 2 days for a response before opening a case. Once opening a case, I almost immediately got offered a partial refund of $10 which I promptly rejected. Then I clicked the button asking for eBay to step in because I wasn't having any of that. Paypal refunded me the price of the sandals + shipping within a few hours. I was confused because there was nothing about how to send the seller the sandals back and no credit for postage. The next day I called customer service explaining the situation, and they told me that eBay refunded me and that the seller still got the money for the sandals. It pissed me off that it was eBay that took the hit for it and not the seller because they were not worth what I paid for them.   
Anyway, getting to the purpose of the post, should I leave this seller bad feedback? They deserve it, but I don't want any negative feedback in return because I sell on eBay myself.",9.0,1,2014-10-30,EBAY,0.1955133080482483,0.7728525400161743,0.031634096056222916

Ebay,Most eBay reps can't answer the most simple questions. another August update seller story,"Something has to be done with the new August update. That's the bottom line. We are a large used electronic store on eBay and my business is crumbling to the ground. I always accept returns and even if an item has been cherry picked and parts removed, I write it off and move on. 

If somebody buys something on error and they don't want it, instead of contacting me a lot of them just open a dispute and say it doesn't work. Almost all of the time, it works just fine when received. However, eBay does not care and rates me based on that. 

We recently were hammered by quite a few returns ""not as described"" in the 14 day return policy, so the return requests hit me with a bump on my seller dashboard to put me at 3.52% all in the course of a few weeks. Now I just noticed my evaluation is from August 1st - October 31st.

My question is, tomorrow does this reset completely, or should I maybe shut down my eBay account for a few months and bite the bullet and scrape together to keep things alive. I don't want a low standard rating to flag and me somehow be in a suspended seller purge. 


I know how to fix it in the future. Quit selling sub 100.00 tablets to people (They expect quality of a $300+ tablet)… I received a not as described on a KINDLE TOUCH because it didn't have a camera and chat feature. eBay reps told me that I need to make sure and note they don't have cameras. I always keep my cool with them because they can't do anything but help me and I don't want to upset them, but I asked if I should also disclaim numerous other features it doesn't have (lead paint, visible antenna, it's not purple, etc). It's obnoxious that I receive hits on items such as that. It's just not right.

Anyways, back to the original question. If I am at a 3.52% and don't want to hit the defect percentage of 5%, can I just stop selling on eBay for a few months and it will start over, or does it reset tomorrow? I want to get a fresh start on everything and get away from these small tablet sales that are killing me. 

This is my life, and I have two employees. If I can wait it out and reset, I will do it. We can sustain on Amazon, Craigslist, Swappa, and Liquidation.com I am sure. I just don't want to be part of a huge suspension purge on eBay and we need eBay for our unique items/ industrial type stuff we sell. You would think me paying them 20,000+ in fees a year they would at least sit down with a level head and see I am not trying to cheat anybody. It's in the messages with every buyer. But instead they always say some generic response.


EDIT:
This blows me away. So I mentioned that eBay reps weren't willing to help me (Well the ones I had previously talked to). One of them really was ready to go to lunch or something because he was telling me ""I would have to look into each case to see…"" when I was asking if some of the cases could be pulled off.

SO I decided to call eBay until somebody answered that seemed like they might care about helping people. The first lady that answered just had a drag about her, when asking about cases I had against me that said items not received, she was asking questions I had answered. I hung up (didn't get mad, yell or anything. Just hung up). Called again and got a nice lady that actually looked into the items not received claims and took every one off because they were not valid. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Thanks to that lady I could really be saved here, but numerous calls this week yielded nothing but a lot of lazy employees in my opinion. I am sure there are lots of good ones but there are in fact some that are just awful.

I still have the Return Requests: Items not as described dinging my account but hopefully I can clear everything up, make it through this rough patch, get my lower value electronics off eBay, and not get suspended or banned. I can't believe they even suspend accounts forever that are genuine good people.",11.0,9,2014-10-31,EBAY,0.08186494559049606,0.8911676406860352,0.026967477053403854

Ebay,"Warning to all Ebay sellers! You need to know about this new policy, it will change everything, horror!!","WARNING TO PEOPLE WHO SELL ON EBAY, THIS IS YOUR FAIR WARNING OF THE NEW POLICIES IN PLACE THAT CAN EFFECT YOUR BUSINESS IN A HORRIFIC WAY!

Ebay has a new policy, ""No hassle"" returns on all items... what does that mean for us sellers?

While at a glance it just seems like a nice way for buyers to feel confident in their purchase. There is, however, a huge problem with this policy that sellers aren't aware of.

I've been a power seller on Ebay for years working hard to build a great reputation through fair practices. However, today I found that my honesty &amp; high selling record is unappreciated by Ebay to say the least.

This is what occurred, you tell me if you still feel safe selling on Ebay... 

 I sell ""Designer items (Chanel, Burberry ect),"" occasionally a buyer will accuse me saying, ""Yeah, I don't know it's authentic?"" Fortunately, most high end designer products have codes, numbers on the items for the purpose of identifying a real from the fake. You would think that that would be enough to protect sellers from false accusations and mistreated returns... not so with Ebay's new policy.

This last week I had a buyer purchase an expensive group of items from me. I don't offer returns on these particular items for the reasons above. I noticed under the ""new policy,"" that there was a request for a return and a case had been opened against me. I received a message from Ebay saying, ""A case had been opened, please respond with your side of things."" Yet there was no way for me to do that, so I contacted customer service. They explained to me that the buyer had accused me of selling inauthentic item, it wasn't true.

 I asked Ebay if they could explain what the buyer had said. They refused to tell me... other than to say that he accused me of selling something inauthentic. Ebay told me that they were going to review the case and get back to me in a few days. Meanwhile, I wasn't allowed to respond to the case or give any proof of the authenticity of the items. A few days later I got a notice saying that the case had been closed in the buyers favor, he was free to return the items and get a full refund.

This didn't make sense, so called Ebay and again asked what was going on? The rep transfered me to the department handling the matter, but nobody picked up the line 45 MINUTES!

Finally a women answered the phone... She told me that the buyer was given permission to return the items -never mind the fact that he failed to provide any evidence of inauthenticity. I explained to the rep that I've had buyers returned items that were damaged...what happens if these items get damaged in the return from poor packaging? The rep told me Ebay WOULD NOT get involved with that. For clairty sake, I said, ""Let me get this straight, anybody get on Ebay and purchase an item, damage it, accuse the seller of a fake product and return it without any consequences?"" The answer was yes. Not only that, but a buyer can send back a completely different item and get away with it as long as they provided tracking. Again, once the buyer put's in the request for the refund, it's a done deal, no questions asked, nor does Ebay follow-up to make sure that the buyer got back the item in good condition or in any condition, because they don't follow up period!

Other selling sites such as Amazon, Esty doesn't treat their sellers this way. Nor would ANY store accept returns on items that's been damaged, they always reserve the right to refuse a return at their leisure. As a seller, I feel I've been put in an extremely vunerable situation and expressed this to the rep. It was amazing how unconcerned she sounded. She spoke in an extremely cavalier  tone about the whole thing, (After-all it's not her personal inventory at stake). She even implied I was fortunate to have a site like Ebay to sell on... It was such a wowsa moment. Needles to say, I won't recommend selling on Ebay with this new policy.
