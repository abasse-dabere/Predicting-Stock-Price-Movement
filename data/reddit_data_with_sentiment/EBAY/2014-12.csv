Ebay,Is anyone just completely done with ebay?,"I know this sub doesn't want for rants but as a pre Y2K eBayer, both buyer and seller, who fondly remembers back when it was the COMPLETE wild west and very much enjoyed those few golden years in the early 00's when you could make $50K in your sleep flipping garage sale stuff before everyone else woke up to ebay, I'm done with ebay now and it wasn't one horrible experience that soured me. The camels back just finally broke under the weight of their terrible seller policies. 

The buyer/seller imbalance is just repugnant. The removal of two way negative feedback has had serious unintended consequences, to the point that I can now safely assume that at least 20% of my sales will involve a predatory buyer complaint seeking 'partial refunds'. I run very clean auctions with VERY well described and photographed items. Its gotten totally out of hand. 

Unfortunately, it seems that too many grifters have learned how to work the Buyer Compaint and Paypal chargeback systems to the point that its become a total minefield for sellers where you run a huge risk of losing your item AND not getting paid. Go read the nightmare stories of people who sold items in the hundreds, even thousands of dollars only to get hit with a return and receive back a package with a brick in it.

This is without even getting into the fees...

Adios, eBay. I never thought I'd see the day when your company was vulnerable to a well funded competitor but I think that day might finally be coming. 

* tl;dr cliffs:  I had a bunch of stuff that previously would've gone on ebay 100% of the time but now, my first instinct was to sell it locally because for the first time in 15 years all, the headaches and risks ebay now creates has finally made it not worth the few extra bucks they tend to bring. Will probably stick around as a buyer but am now done selling.",19,18,2014-12-01,EBAY,0.11700861901044846,0.854732871055603,0.028258537873625755
Ebay,"F'd over, lied to, neutral feedback!","I sold four super Nintendo games, and shipped them in a small flat rate box with no packing, as I've done many many times.

This buyer leaves a neutral ""Extremely poorly packed. No bubble wrap nothing to protect these games at!""

I wrote the buyer a message saying something along the lines of, hey, the games arrived in the condition as described, otherwise you would have complained about that, my question to you is, if I refund your shipping (since that's what you had the issue with) would you accept a feedback revision request, and change the neutral feedback to a positive?

He replies, Yes, I agree to that.

So I send the revision request, and yup, you've guessed it, no reply...

I called eBay about a day before it expired, and they said, ok I see the messages, call back if It times out and we'll get it removed.

So I call eBay today.. spoke with two different reps, and they kept quoting the removal of feedback policies, along with throwing in some 'you knew this could happen when you signed up to do business online', 'the feedback is an opinion and cannot be removed', and of course I said, if you actually read the messages, you would note that this was an agreement between us, etc, etc,.

No sorry, nothing we can do, etc.

So, I get a defect, lose shipping costs, and get lied to by the buyer and eBay rep. 

What a lovely day, all I tried to do was 'make it right' for the buyer.",13,4,2014-12-01,EBAY,0.06676817685365677,0.8856764435768127,0.047555457800626755

Ebay,Trying to resolve a bug with the shopping cart.,"I'm not certain if this is the best sub, but I'm not sure where else to post. 

I attempted to purchase several items from different sellers on 10/29/14, and followed the steps for payment, as I have done countless times before. I quickly received a receipt from paypal stating the item numbers, sellers, amounts paid, and transaction numbers. However, one item was still in my cart upon returning to ebay, even though paypal shows the item was paid for. The item is now sold, and there is no record of my interaction as far as ebay is concerned. 

I found a replacement item, and have been in touch with my credit card company to credit the payment. I am not looking to file a dispute with the seller for an item they never sent, because they had no notification from ebay that I sent payment for said item. I would rather they have no repercussions as the fault is not theirs. 

Is there any way to bring this to the attention of one of their developers or other concerned party? I got the runaround from ebay customer service who could not understand the issue. If there is a better way to let them know of this issue, I'd like to help resolve it.

Ebay,What happens if I refuse a buyer's request to cancel an order?,"I'm sorry for this noobish question but I'm hoping somebody will shed some light for me.

I know that I can offer a second chance to another bidder and I know that refusing a cancellation request is largely futile. But I'm curious as to what would happen if I refuse to cancel the order.

So after waiting generously 2 weeks I put up a cancellation on a order since the buyer was not responding to any of my emails (he did not pay up) however, I decided to text the buyer a few days ago and he wasn't aware that he didn't pay for it and still wanted the item.  

Well he went ahead and paid it off and plan on shipping it out today.  However, eBay writes back saying ""All done. This order is canceled."" and I will be credited for any fee's....  what do I do? am I safe to go ahead and ship it out?  or could the buyer get the item and write to ebay that I never refunded him since I was told to refund prior to cancellation.

Ebay,Problem with Ebay buyer - what to do?,"I sold an item on Ebay recently. It sold last Saturday (11/22). The user paid on the evening of 11/24 (after USPS was closed). I shipped, via USPS priority, on 11/25. However - I made a mistake - I shipped to the wrong address. So I had USPS intercept the package and forward it to the buyer. This added a few days to the delivery time, and it was delivered on Monday, 12/1. I should note that in my auction I specified that it could take as long as 3 days for me to ship (and thus another two days for delivery). I informed the buyer of my mistake and he was not happy - please see conversation log below. What do you all suggest I do? Out of principle I do not want to refund this guy anything - I have not done anything wrong. As a proud American - I do not negotiate with (ebay) terrorists.


**Me:**
&gt;Hi - when shipping your item yesterday I accidentally entered the wrong address and had it sent to a different person who also just purchased some bib tights from me. I have asked USPS to reroute the package but it may delay things a day or two. Please let me know how it goes - I'm very curious as I've never had to reroute a package before. My apologies for any delays that happen.

**user:**
&gt;Thanks for the update on wrong ship address.  Please refund $10 in shipping for your tardiness and good customer service.  I was really hoping to use these during the holiday break

**Me:**
&gt;If they arrive late I will refund shipping. EBay auction specifies I have 3 days to ship. I shipped early

**user:**
&gt;If they arrive late I will refuse shipment and send back for refund.  Or you can take care of business and refund shipping now.   I expect no less!

**Me:**
&gt;you paid on Monday. The Ebay auction states in the shipping section ""Will usually ship within 3 business days of receiving cleared payment"" So that means I would have till Thursday to ship, except USPS is closed on Thursday, so that means I have till Friday to ship. With two day shipping that means that they have till Tuesday to arrive. I shipped on Tuesday. Two days early. On Wednesday I realized the mistake I made and asked USPS to redirect the shipment to you. This cost me $18.22 (plus whatever I had already paid for the shipment). I expect they will arrive on Friday or Saturday. But we'll see. I do not understand why you would refuse shipment when the item is expected to arrive within the timeframe given in the auction. Can you please explain that to me?

**user:**
&gt;Let me know your decision, I can refuse shipment or I would accept a $10 credit on shipping.

**Me:**
&gt;I pride myself in keeping my customers happy. I work very hard to make sure that always is the case. However, in this case, I have fulfilled all my obligations to you and you received the item within the time frame described in the auction (I show it as being delivered today). Your demand for $10 is without a valid reason, so as a matter of principle I will have to deny it. If I had done something wrong I would be much more understanding - but again, you have received your item on time.

&gt;Please understand that I do not accept returns. This is called out in my auction.

&gt;Again, I am sorry that you are not pleased but I can only advise you to read the auction more carefully in the future and to pay more quickly when you need something quickly.

**user:**
&gt;I received your notice so I will be shipping this item back.  I will be going into great detail on my reason with ebay.  I find you very unreasonable and inflexiable to work with on this matter.  I will give you an extra 24 hours to think of another resolution.  Please refund in full.

Ebay,Another odd customer story,"So I have this lady who wants to get a custom piece of semi precious stone jewelry made for her, where she has a drawing and knows in her mind exactly what she wants.

and she lets it be known that her budget for this project is $75 but if absolutely necessary she's willing to spend $90 which she says should be enough because that's what mass produced plastic jewelry from china sort of like what she wants goes for.

Oooooookay, obviously that's not going to work and I write a polite reply that her budget doesn't even cover material costs (I even send a link to what the materials she wants to use are selling for) and wish her luck in finding something mass produced more within her budget.

Ebay,Massive eBay Vulnerability for Sellers: Seller (me) Scammed when Buyer Returned Wrong Item. eBay Forcing Refund. What can I do?,"TL;DL Due to a huge flaw in eBay's website that opens sellers up to massive liability, a buyer is trying to scam me by initiating a refund claim and sending me back a lower value item.

I sold an iPhone 6 on eBay a few weeks ago. I described the item extensively and accurately and took a ton of pictures. When the buyer received the iPhone he messaged me to tell me that the phone I sent him was not what was advertised. I sent him an unlocked Verizon 128gb iPhone 6, but he claimed he received a locked Sprint iPhone 6. He also looked up the IMEI number and sent an IMEI report showing that it was a Sprint phone. He initiated an eBay refund and sent the phone back to me. 

When I received the phone I noticed that the identification number on the phone the buyer sent back was different from the identification number on the back of the box and from the identification number on the back of the iPhone I sent him (I took pictures of it before I shipped it). It looks like the buyer swapped the phone I shipped him with a different one that is of lower value. 

When I called eBay to appeal the claim, they told me that because the buyer sent *anything* back to me I am forced to refund him. It doesn't matter that he sent me the incorrect phone, he could have even sent me a piece of plastic, as the seller I'm still required to refund him. eBay said they chalk it up to seller loss. This is quite a **massive** vulnerability to sellers on the eBay platform. The person I spoke with at eBay High Value Claims said there is nothing I can do and if I don't refund the buyer within 3 days they will automatically remove the money from my PayPal account.

Is there anything I can do? The phone sold for over $800. That's a lot of money to be forced to refund for the incorrect item.",39,10,2014-12-04,EBAY,0.11128468811511993,0.8586503863334656,0.03006492555141449
Ebay,Removing 19 Negative Feedback - A Seller Success Story,"So with all the seller horror stories to be had on this sub, I thought you might enjoy a small success story.

We sell [live koi](http://www.ebay.com/sch/nextdaykoi/m.html?item=201206487628&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&amp;rt=nc&amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2562) on eBay.

We've had a buyer who has been a problem for about the last 4 months.  At first it wasn't much, mostly haggling over prices and just being annoying.  Then he started asking us to sell him stuff outside of eBay, which always turns out to be a huge pain for us.  Then he has a couple DOA fish (small, young fish, completely normal) and he FLIPS OUT.  Claiming that our koi have a deadly koi disease with a mortality rate over 90%, claiming he's going to sue us, blah blah blah.  We get him talked down and eventually smooth it out.

Fast forward to a month ago, and he bottom feeds a few items for really cheap.  No problem, someone has to bottom feed.  Then he messages us saying he's going out of town, and asks for the items to be shipped A MONTH LATER.  We have a 10 day limit for holding items.  With live fish, if they stay in holding too long, they can start to break down and become less than 100% healthy.  But he's the buyer, we can't say no and ship the fish while he's not home, that certainly wouldn't end well.

So we come to today.  We pack his order up, but one fish is sick from sitting around in holding for the last 2+ months.  I email him about it, issue a refund.  He responds back and is very, very unhappy.  Claims we are reselling fish that sold for cheap.  Claiming that ""your water is diseased"" and going on and on about how unhappy he is.

So I say fine, here's a full refund, I pulled your shipment, and I've canceled the order.  What does he do?  Immediately leaves 19 flame-bait feedback, basically all libelous, about how our fish have that deadly disease discussed before, that we're crooks, that we always resell fish that sold for cheap.  Basically 100% lies.

So most would think we're screwed right?  Well I called eBay, talked to a nice young man named Jonathan, and although it took 45 minutes of waiting through eBay's unbearable hold music, got all the feedback removed!  Bumped us all the way from 99.3% back up to 99.7%, where we rightfully belong.

So to all sellers out there - **If someone violates the terms of your listing, or otherwise goes outside of what is set forth in your listing details, call eBay, it may be worth a few minutes wait on the phone to get some negative feedback removed.**

Ebay,Question about seller cancelling Buy It Now,"A couple days ago I purchased an item via Buy it Now on eBay, for what was a rather good price. The next day I received a message from the seller through eBay informing me that the item had been listed incorrectly, and therefore he had cancelled the order and refunded me. He has now re-listed it at a higher price (the item was about $35 and he re-listed it at $45, for some perspective). I was somewhat annoyed that he cancelled it without even asking me beforehand, especially as it's not like he didn't have the item to sell me- he just wanted to sell it at a higher price.

I assumed this was the end of it and didn't bother responding, but today I received an email asking me to ""accept"" the cancellation in the resolution centre.

Where I last checked in, Ebay over the phone told me that the buyer is definitely in the wrong and has no rights here.

Buyer initiated a return today. He says it's the wrong size for him (it's the size advertised). He also tried to say that I did not describe the item properly, but his explanation does not hold water.

I called Ebay today, and they said I should ignore the return request. That I should not respond at all. That after about a week of no response the buyer will have the option to escalate, and that if/when the buyer does I should then contact Ebay. The gentleman on the phone told me, based on the evidence in my inbox, they should probably find in my favor.

Does that make sense? Not responding feels dangerous.

Ebay,1st negative in 15+ years,"So..I encountered my 1st negative feedback of doing 'garage sale"" selling/buying on ebay.

I post an electronic device on eBay.  I won't go into detail what it is in case he reads reddit. :)

Whenever I post anything for sell on eBay - I try to describe it as much as possible, include as many pictures as I can, over-pack anything I send to avoid damage, and include a statement for the buyers to contact me to avoid any confusion or problems.  

So - I verify this device works to the best of my abilities with what I have.  For some reason, I overlooked testing a certain feature of the device - human error on my part. 

Winning bidder pays for the item and it's shipped out.  A few days later, he received the item and happens to test the exact feature I forgot to test.  He proceeds to open up the device and notices residue inside which he thinks was caused by some liquid.  He submits a refund request which I didn't get a chance to respond to for about a week [my fault for setting up gmail to filter eBay messages into it's own folder]. 

Over the course of that week - he proceeds to disassemble the device further and clean off the residue.

When I finally log in to read his eBay email - I let him know that I made a mistake for not testing that part of the device and would refund his money [part of me thinks I shouldn't since he opened up the device and already cleaned it off - there is a chance he could've damaged it further].

After he receives a shipping label from ebay so he can ship it back for free - he decides it's too much hassle and asks if I wouldn't mind giving him a partial refund to repair the damage he found.  My gut feeling is he's trying to scam me as he didn't provide any pictures of the damage to the device.   I decline as I want the device shipped back so I can inspect it and request him to send it back.

Over the course of multiple emails of me requesting him to send it back, he complains about the device not working, that he's looking into seeing how much it will cost to fix it, and eventually tells me I'm naive that I didn't see the damage [which was INSIDE the device] and will let me know if he plans to keep it depending upon how much it'll cost for him to fix it.

Today - the request for him to return it expires and he chooses to keep the device.

He then posts a negative comment about how I shipped a defective item and he has to pay out of his own pocket to fix it.

Yes - this is a clear INAD [item not as described] and I admit that.

However - I requested multiple times for him to return it and he chose rather to keep it and give me negative feedback.

I responded to his negative feedback ""buyer refused the refund and chose to keep it"" so future buyers will know I offered to refund his money.  This is what I would suggest anyone do if the buyer is in the wrong - keep it simple.

I've also contacted ebay to investigate him in case he's tried to what I think is scamming other buyers.  From reading other posts - this sounds like a recent trend [?] which will make me rethink what I will sell on eBay anymore..if at all [I have other avenues to sell items which don't involve excessive eBay/PayPal fees]",10,5,2014-12-06,EBAY,0.18381159007549286,0.7865557074546814,0.029632681980729103

Ebay,Am I protected under Ebay's money back guarantee if I use it on purpose?,"I was browsing for a winter coat, and filtered for items made of 100% cashmere.

Ebay,Advice on an idiot buyer.,"So on November 22 I sold an item to a buyer via best offer I had it up for $125, they offered $88 and I countered $100.  They accepted but then didn't pay.  I sent them a payment reminder on the 29th then opened an unpaid item case on I think Dec. 3rd.  The day before the unpaid item case was to resolve I sent them a message letting them know that it was their last opportunity to pay.  Stupidly I forgot to block them so when I relisted it this morning they sent me a $100 offer and then 30 seconds later clicked buy it now for the full $125 and sent me a message asking me to adjust the price down to $100 or refund $25 after they payed.  I'm an understanding and pretty easygoing guy so I said sure I'll refund the $25 if you pay immediately(forgetting that I'm going to lose an additional $3.25 because of this).

So they paid and then sent me this message ""thanks, please also call ebay and have the stike removed from my account since I payed..im not sure why payment didnt go through before""  Now I'm a pretty chill guy like I said but there is no way I'm going to waste 30 minutes to 2 hours on the phone trying to get this strike removed for him.

Ebay,Am I getting scammed?,"Right, so I am selling an iPhone 5 in Germany for €230. Yesterday, I get an offer from someone of €300. He spoke English, so I wrote to him the product description in English in case he couldn't read German. He said that's okay, and kept offering me €300. I accept his price. He says he bought the device on ebay (but my ebay doesn't say so) and I got an email from fund-verifications@accountant.com saying that there is €350 being transferred to my PayPal however, it won't appear until I respond to the email with shipping information. btw, it's €350 now because he says the extra €50 is going to cover shipping.  

At first I thought nothing of it, packed the device up and just before going to the post, I checked the address. Going to Ibadan in Nigeria. Red flag for me. I look for the specific address, and it doesn't exist. The street does but the building with the house number doesn't. I contact the ""buyer"" about this, he says it's a local place, I should send it, it will get there. I say I'm not sending anything until I see the money on my PayPal. He says that I need to prove shipment to get the money. He ""assures"" me that I am going to get it, he apparently has been using this method the past 3 months and it ""works"". I still refuse to send device before seeing the money on my PayPal. I still have the device on my table so I haven't been scammed, but I want to know if this is. 

------------
tl:dr

To me it is pretty obvious that it is a scam (going to Nigeria from Germany, 6488km). I wan't to report this user for scam so others don't get scammed, however, I don't have evidence. Should I fake the shipment slip and tracking number and send that to prove shipment (because then I should get the money transferred to my PayPal)? I want to do that to see if I actually get the money. If I get it, then I will send device if not, then I know it's a scammer and I don't lose the device and I can report user. I have actually faked the shipment slip already, just haven't sent it to them.

Ebay,Would paying for a transaction using a PayPal invoice be against eBay usage policy?,"(For context:  I'm a longtime seller, first-time buyer.)

Earlier today, I won an auction, and am encountering problems with a seller.  In attempting to pay, I was told by eBay that their PayPal account cannot currently process the payment (I suspect, but can't confirm, that the seller's PayPal account being restricted is the cause).  In trying to resolve the matter with the seller, she proposed using a PayPal invoice as a payment method for me instead.  

Obviously, PayPal is (for now) a subsidiary of e-Bay, and PayPal transactions are normally used for eBay payments.  However, since this would be a separate transaction, would this still be considered ""resolving the sale independent of eBay"" and void my consumer protections offered through the service?",15,2,2014-12-07,EBAY,0.08535673469305038,0.8953430652618408,0.019300220534205437

Ebay,"I'm currently being scammed by ebay, what should I do?","Ebay is currently running a scam. For several months they have been offering a promotion at [ebay]/ebayforthewin for selling your used phones. The promotion details are: if you sell your phone on ebay, and you get less than the current ""trending price""; they will give you an ebay coupon for the difference. If it doesn't sell they will give you a $100 coupon (within 7-10 days). This is an utter lie. Here is exactly what happened to me:

&amp;nbsp;

I saw a message in my ebay inbox, detailing the promotion with a link to the page sometime around September; I didn't initially put it up because I wasn't up for a new phone until November. Come November, I clicked the link and their selling tool had you enter in all the information about your phone and created the listing (including the price you have to start the phone at) automatically. In this listing it showed you the trending price of your phone (that they based the coupon on). **It was around $300 dollars for my phone at the time**. That was what made me sell my phone, I was so excited I told my coworker and emailed him the link to the promotion. My auction sold for ~$100 less than what they offered. I was not happy, and was justifying the new phone cost on the amount that was quoted me. No sweat though, I would be getting $100 dollar coupon back right? Nope… Read on.

&amp;nbsp;

After my phone sold I was a little worried because I was $100 short of the price; I went to refer to the message ebay sent me to verify all the details. I searched everywhere for that original message and it was nowhere to be found. Very strange, considering I referred to it at least 4 times in the past week (I have never deleted any messages from my ebay account) luckily the link I sent my coworker a week earlier was still live.  I was still concerned at this point. Before I shipped the phone, I wanted to make 100% sure I would be receiving the coupon, so I requested a call. The original CSR acted like she didn’t know anything about the promotion (they had been running it for over a month now) and asked me for the message that was sent (the same one that disappeared). I told her it disappeared and she started acting like she couldn’t help me **(first red flag)**. I had the link memorized though so I gave her the link and she later came back and said I need to talk to a specialist. The specialist lady was **extremely** nice and verified my listing qualified (I knew it had to because I used their selling tool to do everything). She verified it and even looked up the trending amount again for me, told me exactly how much the coupon would be and “marked the system” to make sure the coupon got sent out 7-10 days. Wow, that was super reassuring! Before she hung up I asked her **can you add all of these details to the notes under my account?**. She told me she already did and I was set. Great!  After the 31 minute phone call, I sent the phone out without any concern.

&amp;nbsp;

It was about 15 business days later when I decided to check up on the progress of my coupon. I request another call; this is when everything changed. I explained the entire situation to the CSR who informed me there were no notes and no evidence at all of any communication on this situation. I was extremely upset and said there are very detailed notes and they need to look harder. After a 10 minute phone call they said they would need a couple hours to research their system and try to find the notes. We scheduled a callback for 12:30 – two hours later. Surely they’d call me back right?

&amp;nbsp;

About 4.5 hours later I requested another call. At this point I felt for sure they were avoiding the situation, and feeding me BS. This time I was not happy at all. Again I explained the entire situation, and again was told there were no notes or anything on the situation. I was being extremely courteous to the CSR (knowing it wasn’t their fault). She looked up the **current** trending price and said that I would receive a coupon for $13 dollars for the difference. I told her that was completely unacceptable. She said that I would have to provide her with the trending price at the time of the auction. I knew that wouldn’t possibly work. I said that was ridiculous: ebay has to know that amount and it should not be the costumers responsibility to know such details. She told me that is how the promotion works. At this point I lost my temper. I asked her if everyone who took part in this promotion literally has to call and request their coupon, and must also remember the trending price at the time of listing? She said yes. I told her I need to talk to your supervisor. She told me to hold and came back on to tell me again that they need me to provide them the trending price at time of listing and I again said that is unacceptable let me talk to a supervisor. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was transferred to an accounts specialist. I again explained my entire situation. I told her there were detailed notes, the date and time of my original call. She informed me again that there was nothing. I was asked for a reference number (which I was never given or heard of such a thing). Then she offered a miracle: she said they could pull audio records from the phone call. Yes that will do it I said. I remember every time I spoke to someone, they mentioned the call would be recorded and I had to say it was ok. Perfect! I told her the exact date, time and even how long the phone call was when the specialist told me all the detailed information. I told her we didn’t even need to talk any further and that would clear up all the issues immediately. She said it would take 2 days to recover. That’s fine. I made a prediction that either a) I wouldn’t get a call back or b) they would say they had no audio records.

&amp;nbsp;

The answer was c) she said they had audio records but there was no mention of the trending price. Thanks for playing! The specialist offered me a $13 dollar coupon again. At this point it became personal. I wrote a message back telling her that was unacceptable and explained how with all the historical information ebay has that this request is ludicrous. I explained how I felt I was being taken advantage of and how there were (at quick search) 150 other phones similar to mine that were sold **on the same day**. I proposed many different ways to get the trending price at that time, including looking at any of the 150 auctions coupon amounts (that is if they weren’t denying them their coupon amount also) and reiterated the details of the first phone call I made. I requested a copy of the phone call audio so I could be sure I wasn’t being scammed. All being said, it was a lengthy message with many details. Surely, I would get a decent response back right?

&amp;nbsp;

I received a response: “We understand that at this point, you want to have the call recording. However, such information is not available for customers and we keep call recordings for training and quality purposes only.” That’s it; end of response. You got to be f’ing kidding me.

&amp;nbsp;

I responded with this: “Thank you for responding in such short time. That is especially convenient for ebay. I am really trying to hold my composure on this issue. The fact that you did not address any of the issues (other than the recording) in my message in your response leads me to believe that you are no longer interested in helping me. At this time I would like to request that you transfer or elevate this request to someone who will be interested in helping me. Additionally, you have not denied that I am being scammed, and offered me no assurance that I am not being taken advantage of. At this point I am starting to feel this conflict is becoming personal. Unfortunately, I do have a tolerance and although it is high, it is near that threshold. I will not let this issue go until it is righted. I really truly hope that people who are trying to take part of this promotion will not get scammed as I feel I am, and I feel like it may become my responsibility to raise awareness of this situation.”

&amp;nbsp;

It’s been 2 days. What do I do?

&amp;nbsp;

Tldr; ebay is straight up scamming it’s customers by advertising they will give you a coupon for selling your used phone if it doesn’t reach it’s current trending price, but they will not. Promotional details obtained at [ebay]/ebayforthewin.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit**: I submitted a complaint to the BBB about the matter.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit2**: clarified site location

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit3**: BBB responded saying it could not submit the complaint:We regret to inform you that BBB cannot process your complaint. The case has been reviewed by one of our Complaint Specialists and was found to contain issues that are out of BBB?s purview. I have no idea what they are talking about. I filed a second complaint.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 4**: Second BBB complaint filed successully

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 5**: Ebay must have a team handling BBB complaints. I got a response extremely fast but I didn't happen to notice the email because it went to spam. They did a short investigation and were able to determine the trending price and issued me a coupon which was more than promised. I never received an ebay message so I didn't know, but I called ebay again and asked about any progress and they told me. I later went back to the BBB site and saw the response. It was a nice gesture on their part but I still feel like nothing would have been done if I didn't register the complaint.",41,8,2014-12-08,EBAY,0.04441729933023453,0.9212301969528198,0.03435254096984863
Ebay,What sniping service/program do you use and how secure do you feel it is?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction_sniping

&gt;Auction sniping is the practice, in a timed online auction, of placing a higher bid than the current highest public bid at the last possible moment (often seconds before the end of the auction), giving the other bidders no time to outbid the sniper. This can be done manually, or by software. 

Sniping is legal and allowed, whether you like it or not. If you don't use this technique manually or with a service/program, it will be used against you. See http://www.ebay.com/gds/Sniping-The-Best-kept-secret-on-Ebay-/10000000002571474/g.html

Not using it means you will pay more for more items in the long run, which is only to the advantage of eBay and sellers. Obviously eBay could get around this by adding time to the auction if there was a late bid, but they have not done so.

Unfortunately I have to be at work and can't sit and time a last minute bid very often, which is why I'm looking into this. Thank you for your help.",11,6,2014-12-08,EBAY,0.05296442285180092,0.9122458696365356,0.034789714962244034

Ebay,Possible buyer scam. Thought I would share so you can beware.,"About a week ago I sold a painting and a frame to a user that had a 0 rating with a brand new account. The buyer paid on time and was very insistent that I give her feedback right away because she just paid. I gave her good feedback because she did pay quickly and then I shipped the package. A week goes by and then I receive a communication stating that the package never arrived. I looked on my eBay account, clicked the tracking number associated with the sold listing and noticed it said delivered at mailbox. I replied to the buyer and she ignored my comments and sent me the USPS tracking info which stated the package was refused and back in transit to me and she wants her money now for a birthday gift. I asked if she refused the package and she ignored me and said ""never received item"" in broken english. She demanded a refund again and I told her that there is a no refund policy and if she has a dispute to please open a claim. She again asked for her money back and threw some russian words at me. I responded to her and said she has to open a claim. Finally she opened a claim last night at 3am. I called USPS this morning for more details and I was informed that although the package tracking says ""refused"" on the public tracking info, the package was actually delivered and the buyer returned it to a post office in another zip code which was not the originating post office. The buyer essentially had the package for 24 hours, claimed she never got it and was trying to return it. I don't know if she sent back my goods or a sack of potatoes. I called eBay after to dispute the claim and they closed the case in my favor and paypal released the funds.

Ebay,eBay Black Friday Deal - Still hasn't shipped...,"So the week before last week, on Wednesday Night, right after midnight (technically Thursday, the 27th), I purchased my Wii U -- an eBay Black Friday deal advertised on their home page from the seller ""buy"" who I guess is eBay affiliated somehow. buy

It was estimated to ship Friday the 28th from a few hours away in PA (I'm in NY).
Estimated Arrival was between Wed 3rd - Thurs 4th.

Wednesday comes around, no package (cool, whatever).

Thursday comes around, no package. Checked tracking. Doesn't look like there's much info.

Friday comes around, I take off work to wait for the package in case I have to sign for it (Amazon I don't, eBay I usually do). I wait all day in visual sight of the door, with it open. Nothing.

Saturday. Still nothing. Saturday night Smash party I planned a week and a half in advance, sent out invitations for, bought lots of beer and food for, ruined. (We still got drunk, anyway).
I contacted the seller to ask what the issue was, no response yet. The shipping status says the label was printed the week before last week on Friday the 28th. Doesn't show any more steps beyond that.

Help please. What can I do? I obviously can't go back in time now and buy a different Wii U on a Black Friday deal, which sucks, because now it's $100 more anywhere else. I just want my Wii :'(

I ordered a cat angel for a Christmas tree topper. I knew it would be a little smaller than I'd like but...

Me:Hi- I was a little disappointed by the size of this item. From the tip of the wing to the bottom of the cloth it's almost 7"", not the 8"" in the description. Looks kind of small on the top of my 6' tree. However I do love it and adding some lights around it helps a bit. I didn't want to include this info in my feedback because I'm sure it was just a mistake but I thought you might want to know in case you are selling similar items. Other customers might get upset.
I really do love it though and it will always have a place on top of my tree. Hope you have a very, merry Christmas!

Seller:I measured it as thought I should. I had no reason to misstate size. Selling things cat as it breaks my heart reminds me of my dying cat. Nothing else I gave like it. Wanted to find my cat things s loving home. 

Me:Please understand- I never thought you tried to misrepresent the size. My measuring tape just showed it to be smaller than stated.
I assume it was just a mistake. But it's okay, I'll get over that. As I said I do love it still.
I'm so sorry for your baby. I still mourn for my boy who died in 2012 on Halloween, from heart disease. For me the best part of Christmas is the joy my cats get out of it.

Ebay,I think I am screwed already,"I'm sure that I'm screwed now so I want to tell my story so people can avoid getting scammed like that in the future.

So my ebay account I normally deal with cards( magic the gathering, yugioh). What happened is: I've listed a complete deck core worth about 500 for sale. Some days later it gets sold, buyer asks me to ship it fast since he needed the deck for Saturday. 


It is Monday now and I ship the item using xpresspost and insure it for 500 to make sure it doesn't get damaged on the way and make sure it arrives there.


Wednesday arrives and according to the tracking information the item arrives at destination, buyer is not there so they leave a card to have them pick up at his local postal office. He picks the item in the same day. 


I see no issues with that as few days passes so I transfer the money to my bank account. Comes in next Monday he says in broken english to contact usps to say he received wrong item. I reply saying that I'm 100 sure he got the right item and That I do not accept returns as I marked. He then says he will contact ebay since item not as described and he opens a case for item not as described. 


Here is where things get sour. I still get no information from the buyer in regards what is wrong with the item or anything so I decided to let ebay solve this since I believed (wrongly) that since he took 5 days to say the cards were not as described, sent a weird 1st message to me to contact usps. 


I lost the case. Ebay told buyer to ship item back to me and he will be refunded once I receive the item. He puts a tracking number and sends it. Comes day of delivery I do not receive the item and in the tracking information it says recipient not found item is being returned to the sender. Regardless of this ebay refunds the buyer.


I tried to contact ebay so I could at least get the ""my"" item back and withhold  the refund. Appeal agent gives me bad service by not listening to my concerns and insists in saying that I need proof from canada post that it was shipped to the wrong address. I call canada post and they tell me they don't have the address for the goods since the sender didn't send it in a package, but in a padded envelope. (For regards I shipped as a parcel in a box, so clearly buyer didn't ship the cards I've sent.) 


I tried contacting ebay again but the second agent is even more unhelpful than the 1st one. Tries to cut me off when I try to explain things, says no wrong address proof we won't do anything. I got angry at a point of shouting ""I'll sue you"" and other profanities. 


So I learned my lesson. Ebay will blindly side with the buyer even if he has a low rating and the seller is 5 stars etc, no matter how sketchy the buyer is acting, no consideration of the nature of the goods, not even when the messages the buyer are off or not even caring that the buyer never said what was wrong with the item.


I guess if I want to sell with ebay again I'll have to film everything (unless they still side with the buyer)


tl;dr

Buyer pulls an evident scam, ebay still sides with him.",14,4,2014-12-09,EBAY,0.18679580092430115,0.789635181427002,0.023569030687212944
Ebay,I feel like you guys can help me with a buyer trying to scam me,"I shipped an item out to this woman and immediately I knew something was up. I was receiving emails for tracking information and being bombarded with questions why there wasn't tracking. I reassured her there was nowhere in my listing that tracking would be issued as it is a ridiculous cost to ship with tracking from Canada.

The item has finally arrived to her after numerous complaints of the shipping time and what do you know... the item I sent her and tested prior to being sent ""doesn't work"". I entertained her fallacy and she insisted I give her a refund. I looked up online and there is a history of the item I sent her being fake (Mine is 100 percent real). After a back and forth finally I agreed to take the item back if it is the exact item I sent to her in the same working condition, and I have pictures to prove what mine looks like, as I fear she will return a fake one she may have received. Immediately a time bomb goes off and she starts complaining I am harrassing her and that i should know longer contact her and that ebay would be contacting me through a dispute.

I ignore this nonsense and reply that it is under ebay policy that she ships the item first and if it is the same item I sent in the same condition I should return the money. She wants me to send the money first. I have dealt with ebay customer service before and I know if i send her that money I will never see my item or money again.

She is smart. She hasn't threatened to leave negative or anything that breaches the buyer protection program. I don't know what to do. Can anyone help?

Ebay,Item location scams?,"I bought a USB cable a couple weeks ago. I paid a little more to buy an item from the US instead of China because it takes so long to get them from China, and none of the USB cables I've purchased from China have ever worked.

It took them almost a week to mark the item as shipped, and the tracking number says it was supposed to be delivered this past Monday. When it didn't arrive, I checked the tracking, and the tracking hasn't been updated since the day they shipped it.

So this morning I looked at the seller's details. They've only been a member since January, and yet they have tens of thousands of feedbacks. Despite having quite a few negatives, they have a top seller status because they've had so many transactions. (Whether all of those were legitimate, I don't know.)

It turns out this seller is located in China, despite the fact that the item location said USA. Looking through their feedback, I see that every item claims to be located in the same country as the buyer.

Since when has eBay let the seller choose another country to be the item's location?

Ebay,Help figuring out how to mass upload listings?,"Hello,

On Monday this week, I searched for a part I had listed earlier in the day and found another seller had just posted it as well. After clicking on their listing I realized they did not have any feedback (weird?). After doing a little more digging I see that they've only been a member of eBay for a week or two, BUT they have 40,000 items listed!

Now that got the wheels in my head turning, I knew they couldn't have an army working for them and they had to be using some sort of tool to be uploading these listings in bulk. So I check today, and they are now at over 60,000 listings. 60,000+ listings in less than 2 weeks! 

I've contacted my distributor, and they were able to enable an option so I can download all of a brands parts and the file will have all the part numbers, prices, title, link to image (in a zip format unfortunately), description (with each bullet point in a new column). Here is a link to a screenshot of how the spreadsheet looks when I get it from my distributor.

http://i.imgur.com/1UBKuEq.jpg

Now my question for all of you are, what is the best way for me to take this information from my distributor and turn it into eBay listings in bulk? I've researched some options, it looks like I can use Seller Manager Pro or Turbo Lister to import csv files. But I'm just sure the best way to go about it. I really want to spend as little time as possible with these listings and just get them up there in bulk ASAP. We have hundreds of thousands of products we could potentially sell, but only have 3000 listings on eBay because we've been doing it by hand...

TL;DR: Need options for taking a distributors spreadsheet filled with part numbers, prices, image links, and descriptions and turning it into eBay listings which I can upload in bulk.

Ebay,Buyer is demanding a full refund and contacted customer support on Dec 8 because 'his package never arrived' when it got there yesterday (he has had a tracking no. since Dec 2),"This guy has been a problem from day 1.

He buys a remote control for a model train set we (my dad and I) can no longer use [Nov 30] and waits a full day to pay [Dec 1.] He pays, then opens a claim the day after [Dec 2] during the middle of the day while everyone is still at work that it hasn't been shipped yet. 

We message him back saying that he shouldn't have waited to pay and that we would've gotten it shipped the day before, and that my dad was just getting home from work. It's shipped promptly the next morning [Dec 3] with a tracking number we give to him.

5 days later [Dec 8] he escalates the claim, claiming 'the item should have arrived two days ago.' He has the tracking number, he knows we shipped it, and yesterday [Dec 10] it arrived and was delivered, meaning he knowingly signed for it. The case is still open awaiting Ebay's customer service.

Basically, my question here is - is Ebay actually going to do anything? I don't see how they could, since we shipped it very promptly, included a tracking number, and did everything we could to be polite to him even while he was being impatient, condescending and just plain rude. It's been 3 days since he contacted customer support and we still haven't heard anything.

Ebay,Advice for dealing with an upset buyer seeking a refund.,"I sold a small collectible item to a buyer protectively wrapped inside of a bubble mailer. Today I got a very irate message from the buyer about how they specifically requested I send the item in a box and even sent an extra dollar to cover the cost. They're claiming that a part of the item was bent in shipping and they want an immediate total refund of the purchase price, shipping cost and their extra dollar. I did not see their message before I shipped the item and feel I packaged it with sufficient protection.

After looking through the order details and my ebay messages for the buyer's request I figured out what they had done. After paying for the item they sent me $1 in a separate paypal transaction and wrote the request in the transaction's note section. I did not notice this among my other paypal transactions. 

This isn't a high value item so normally I would just offer a refund upon return, but I think that even that would anger the person and could lead to negative feedback because they feel I purposefully ignored their request. From my perspective they sent that request in an obscure, inconvenient fashion and at the wrong juncture. A request for special shipping should be agreed upon before they bid on the item or at least before payment so I can alter the invoice. Also I don't see it as the buyer's place to decide how much a change in shipping should cost. This person is an experienced ebayer so I assume they know how to use the message system and also that ebay buyers are generally favored in disputes.

So basically I'm looking looking for advice on how to proceed. What's my best bad option? Should I just issue the total refund and return shipping and hope they send it back? Should I offer to issue a refund on return and hope they choose to do that rather than open an ebay case? Thanks for reading this and giving your input.

Ebay,Lets talk about the worst loopholes in the system.,"I think the worst loophole is the automatic refund for ""Delivered"" returns from opened disputes/cases. A buyer can open a case, demand a return and if granted a return they simply put in a tracking number. The funds are held and the moment that tracking number is marked ""Delivered"" the funds are removed from the seller and refunded back to the buyer.

I once shipped out a bunch of broken PS3 consoles and controllers. Fantastic deal for parts/repair. Buyer complained, said the items were broken/damaged (haha) and the situation above happened. I sent out a 20lb box and got back a 5lb box filled with broken xbox 360 items and literal trash and negative feedback to boot.

The photo of the lady was of her and her kids, they sold parts to electronics like the ""left back short screw for the Xbox 360"" or the ""Center bracket for X model vacuum"" etc. Junk most people wouldn't bother with. She had a touching story written in the profile section too.

First of all, I'm a new seller, &gt;10 feedback, and I recently sold a pair of headphones for around $80-100. It was sold just a little ago and to a user who registered today with 0 feedback, but they paid instantly through Paypal. However, on Paypal it says the user is unregistered, but the address is confirmed. I foolishly printed out the shipping label immediately (Only thing I got was insurance) and completely forgot that they were a new user. 

My thought process was that since they already paid, I should be okay, so  I went ahead and printed out the label. I'm worried that this may be a scam or something bad may happen and what would be the best way to go about this. In my other case from about an hour ago, the buyer was highly rated, but I don't know if I should just ship the item out to this user with 0 feedback tomorrow or if I can even cancel it.

Any suggestions on what I should do? Am I protected from any problems since I paid for insurance?

Ebay,It feels like I have to be a detective to use eBay safely: questions in description.,"During the final hours when a particularly valuable auction is closing, I check my buyer requirements activity log.  I've noticed in at least a few instances, a brand-new account mysteriously appears and bids on the same day someone was blocked from bidding.  I have an auction at about $1K closing within the next 24 hours which got [10 blocked bids](http://i.imgur.com/SXEw0c0.png) from a handful of people today.  Also today, a brand-new account bid on the same item.  The activity log only records the feedback #, feedback % and date the blocked account was created.  

I'm trying to check if there is a correlation between one of these blocked people and the new account.  I've called eBay customer service about this once before but the rep seemed unconcerned and unprofessional (I was not asking for the person's info, just that eBay look into it/what are my options if they win it, etc).  I know reps vary, but the experience was enough to put me off from trying this time.  I don't know why I hadn't thought of this before, but I tried googling ""has been an eBay user since ____"" in an attempt to find the blocked buyer (in case their main account has a similar name or bids on similar items).  I'm not certain if it's working because although I *can* find [a handful of users with the same date](http://i.imgur.com/cuQAcGH.png), their feedback doesn't seem to match the accounts in the activity log.  

**Questions:** Anyone know if this lack of correlation in the activity log is intentional or if certain countries are blocked in this type of google search?  Is the info in the activity log actually random?  Is there some search strategy I'm leaving out?  Anyone ever just ask the 0 feedback person if they're really a blocked bidder?

He mentioned that it is a gift and to not put in the invoice inside because of that. Should I send to the address from the Paypal?

Ebay,"eBay told me I didn't have to refund, and now, they're making me refund.","Hello all, I have a question about a weird thing that happened with a return request I got from a buyer.

A buyer bought a brand new electronic item from me, opened it, used it, then decided that they didn't want it any longer. They opened a return with the reason ""No longer want item."" The header for the return stated, **""The buyer requested a return, but you're not obligated to accept a return for this item. Just reply to the buyer soon.""**

I replied to the buyer apologizing that she did not like the item, but noting that both the listing's return policy and [eBay's official return policy](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/return-item-condition.html) state that new consumer electronics must be returned unopened.

Well, she threw a fit, left negative feedback claiming I pulled a ""return trick"" on her because she had to open the item in order to try it, but this made her return void. Umm? The item was not defective, she just didn't like it... and the return policy was clearly stated when she bought it.

When she left neg feedback, I escalated the case thinking maybe if they took action against the buyer they'd also auto-remove the defect. That was stupid, I realize, but I also escalated because *the case wasn't closing on it's own* and there was no option to simply decline the return, just to keep sending more messages (even though it still said I didn't have to accept it). Maybe I was just supposed to leave it open perpetually, or it would eventually have closed after an unknown number of days, idk.

Here's a weird thing; when I escalated the case, it converted the reason for return from ""No longer want item"" to ""This item doesn't match the description in your listing.""   Wtf? Bad bit of coding?

Anyway, this morning rolls around, and of course eBay in all their great illogic decided to favor the buyer and initiated a return for her. Is there anything I can do about this?",4,5,2014-12-16,EBAY,0.056571971625089645,0.9096141457557678,0.03381386399269104

This is why I have not written the appropriate feedback.
Best,
A.

-----------

I don't care about feedback, I care about getting paid for the item I sold. What is my recourse?

I sell maybe 3 items a decade on eBay. I called them (eBay) before I sold and verified that this is the best way to insure that I will not be taken advantage of. In fact, I cancelled my first order's sale because I wasn't sure of the buyer. 

What can I do? I'm feeling like I was just fucked out of $500.

Thanks.


EDIT: I just checked the PayPal account, and it shows that the seller issued $518 (per the sale and shipping cost) in one transaction. There was then a second transaction for ""-$502.68 USD"". 

This means that PayPal let him have most of his money back? What the FUCK?!?!",13,2,2014-12-20,EBAY,0.03880530223250389,0.9250402450561523,0.03615448996424675

Ebay,Ebay Invoice Help,"So I sold a PS3 Bundle in its original box with two games and two controllers, it weighed around 14-15 pounds. Ebay didnt charge the buyer the $20 shipping and instead charged only $2. I ended up paying for the shipping and now im being charged $24.77  for an invoice. After I contacted ebay and informed eBay about this they told me it wasnt their fault the buyer wasnt charged. They're blaming the post office for not charging the buyer( if it makes any sense), and have even asked me to open a case at the post office.
 I asked them if they could at least deduct $20 from the invoice and they said the only thing I can do is ask the buyer to pay the shipping or return the item. I sold it a month ago so asking the buyer to pay shipping this late would be stupid. I dont feel I should put the buyer in that position when this is a mistake on eBay's part. 
 So I guess my question is:

Is there a way to not be forced to pay an invoice?

Ebay,Annoying situation with eBay and potentially PayPal? Any advice/help appreciated.,"Hey!
So the short version of this ridiculous situation is I work for a very small business. Part of what we do is sell machines on eBay. We sold one machine to a buyer in Germany (we're in the US), and gave them a discount in exchange for not sending a couple removable/exchangeable parts (like, there are 10 different types of these parts, depending on what you'd need the machine for). Told them over and over, X and Y parts are not coming with the machine. They bought it, then once it arrived told us that X and Y parts were missing and we needed to send them for free or they'd open a case with eBay. We fought it, and the buyer ended up closing the case before eBay could get involved (since there were like, 5 messages where we explicitly said ""machine will not be coming with X and Y). Sidenote: we're assuming this buyer does this often, and just hopes that the seller will send free things instead of taking the risk of eBay ruling against them. Ugh.

Anyways. Now the buyer is opening up a dispute within PayPal (since going through eBay didn't work). Should we just tell/show PayPal what we showed eBay? Is eBay even allowed to be involved? Like, we have a ton of messages on eBay, will PayPal be able to look at those when looking at this claim? It's all so ridiculous.

Sorry that turned out kind of long. Thanks for any help!

Ebay,Person says item is fake left negative FB,"tl;dr - person bought item, said it's fake, demanded a refund, left a negative feedback, opened a case with ebay. Whats to stop them from swapping the real item with a fake one? What are my options?


So the story goes like this. I've been selling Urban Decay Naked, 2, &amp; 3 pallets on ebay for about $45 each. They are purchased from Sephora and I have receipts for them. This one buyer has said that it is a fake, there were scratches on the case, and they wanted a refund immediately.

They opened a case with ebay and also left a negative feedback.

So, now I'm here with a negative feedback for a ""fake"" item. I agreed to refund them once the item has been returned. My concern is that they have a fake one and instead of sending me the real one back they're going to send me the fake one. Now I've lost my item, I will have a fake item I can't do anything with, and I've got a negative feedback.

Size 6=size 10 UK. In addition to some brands being Next Petite which will be smaller therefore a size 14 in a petite will be a 10/12 in any other shop. And that they all fit me being a size 10/12 like stated in the auction. I also stated no returns on the auction.

This is the description that I gave...
"" A huge bundle of ladies clothing to fit a size 10/12 woman. There is a variety of clothes, they are all in a good condition from a smoke-free household.

 Brands to include...

Then I gave postal instructions and general stuff. 

What do you think? Should I give a return or are they being unreasonable? 
I do see that maybe I should have been slightly more specific but am I really at fault for an incorrect/misleading description or is it that the buyer is simply not happy with his purchase?

Ebay,My first dispute with a buyer - please give me some guidance! (eBay UK),"Hello

I sold a laptop. It was listed as spares or repairs, as although it booted up fine the fan was extremely noisy and needed replacement.

Because it was something I listed as ""For Parts or Not Working"", I said there were no returns. I am happy to accept returns on anything else, but if it's something complicated that needs to be dismantled to be put back to working order, I feel it's reasonable.

The seller sent eight messages in a very short space of time. He said he can't get into the main user account because it's password protected, and told me the login name. He then set a screenshot of the computer asking for a BIOS password, and asked for a refund, promising me he'd post the laptop the next day.

It sounded like a scam, so I told him I'd give him a refund if he sent the laptop back. He then raised a dispute, saying the computer doesn't boot up and I'm witholding the passwords to make it boot. I have to either:

1. Give him a full refund.
2. Pay him to post it back to me, then give him a full refund.
3. Do nothing, and have Ebay refund him.

I wrote him a message pointing out that if the computer wouldn't boot, he wouldn't know the username of the main user (my partner's name, which we used when reinstalling the operating system). He said that it just asked for the BIOS password once.

Of course I haven't said anything, but I smell a rat. I reinstalled the operating system, I know there are no passwords on it. 

I think it was straightforward buyer's remorse. That won't stop me losing the dispute.

I tried contacting Ebay through the live chat section which was less than useless. I was told in the session that my questions couldn't be answered and was disconnected. I might post the transcript of the chat session, it reads like a play.

I am still worried that I will lose my money. It's the same week as Christmas and we're not on a high income; we can't afford to lose this money! 

As Ebay support doesn't really want to know, I just want some guidance really. Is there any way I can get a human from Ebay to read the discussion between us before they make a decision on the 30th? When I caught him out, he just said it went back to booting and asking for a login password. He tells me he doesn't know what a BIOS password is.

Ebay,Paypal dispute: Proof of postage needed,"Hi, I've been selling on ebay since 2008, but I've never had to deal with a paypal dispute before(only ebay). 

A buyer filed a 'item not received' claim on the 24th. That was found in my favor automatically because I purchased the postage through ebay and the tracking showed as delivered.  They quickly escalted the case to a dispute, and now paypal requires that I submit 'proof of postage'. I honestly don't know what they mean by this, and searching hasn't yielded an answer. The only physical proof of postage I have is a receipt from when I dropped the package off at the Post Office, but this only shows the tracking number and time of drop off. All other documentation is electtonic. Has anyone else had this happen? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Ebay,"Did I just buy ""hot"" property?","I recently bought a router which was listed as ""new-other"", and the posting advertised it as a former display model, but had CDs, accessories, etc. I got the item yesterday, and two issues caught my attention: I seem to have gotten the install software and warranty card for another, cheaper router. Checked those serial numbers and they verify as belonging to a cheaper model. The item did not include the original box (was advertised as no-box), but instead there was a photocopy of the serial number/MAC address panel of ""a"" box for the same model router ordered. On the back of the actual router, there are what look like razor blade marks around where the serial number sticker should be, and what appears to be a regular paper, shrunk down photocopy of ""a"" serial number/MAC address sticker glued onto the back of the router. The numbers on the glued ""sticker"" do match the box panel photocopy. The glued ""sticker"" is placed where the original would have been. This serial number does come back as belonging to the correct model router I ordered. (Looked it up at the manufacturer's warranty site). FWIW, when I powered up the router, the firmware did seem to support that the router itself is in fact, the advertised model, and the MAC address was the same- but I don't know if this alone actually proves that the photocopy info provided really goes with this actual router, or if they just copied the box panel from some other router of the same make/model. Anybody know? And what do you make of the razor marks and ""homemade"" serial/MAC sticker? Did I just receive a stolen router? Or just a mis-listed refurb? Ever heard of this kind of thing?

I did some googling and found only one or two mentions of stores removing serial number labels from floor/demo models, for theft/resale deterrence or something- anybody ever heard of that? My one friend in retail (large appliances) says he's never heard of a store doing anything like that- seems suspect.

Is there a way to see if my item is hot? Do I have any recourse if it is? I have not yet attempted to register it with the manufacturer. Their website does say for them to honor any warranty, the serial number must be present and not tampered with. (So I may have no warranty here anyway).

If it helps- seller has about a dozen total feedbacks, all positive. I see they earlier sold a router model corresponding exactly with the docs/warranty card I was sent- maybe they got switched by mistake? I paid a slightly below average price (maybe ""average"" given it was an open box).

Ebay,Buyer's Protection/Returns,"I sold an $800 item on eBay, shipped it on the 11th. I've sold a few things on eBay/Amazon but never had any problems with buyers before. This guy has been a nightmare through the entire process, blamed me for the slow delivery, etc. According to USPS tracking info, the package was REJECTED on the 15th then had to be sent to a FORWARDED address. 

It was just delivered TODAY and basically immediately the guy emails me that he is returning the item because it was ""not as described."" There were about 10 pictures of the item on the page, item was exactly as described, but whatever. I'm pretty sure this guy is trying to scam me.

Anyway, I have a few questions. 

1) The guy just sent me a message about the return but didn't actually file a return claim. According to ebay policy ""The cost of return shipping is the seller's responsibility. For return of items with a total cost of $750 or more, we require signature confirmation."" I'm assuming this asshat shipped it this morning, didn't offer tracking or anything like that. 

2) I'm wondering if eBays buyer protection, which DOESN'T cover ""Items shipped to another address after original delivery"" includes items that had to be forwarded during delivery. 

Basically, I'm wondering if I would be liable to return his money, considering that he hasn't actually filed a claim (yet), didn't even ask/consult about the return first, and the fact that the item was sent to a different/forwarded address. I've been very active about communicating with him over the last 2 weeks, since he opened a case against me after not getting the item in 2 days.

Does any of this fall under the ""14 day money back guarantee"" or eBay's buyers protection? I seriously doubt I'll be getting my item back at all or in any reasonable condition. Any advice would be really appreciated.

EDIT: Words.

UPDATE: Called eBay and asked for my options. Because buyer has not opened a return claim or provided a tracking number, if this is not done in the next 12 days, I won't be obligated to refund. Also, buyer's remorse isn't covered so if I can prove that (item was listed as ""used"" + 10 pictures and description on listing) then I won't be obligated to refund (ditto for if buyer trashes/tries to switch out item). I'm nervous about how reasonable eBay's resolution center is but I guess I'll find out if/when I get to that point.",6,3,2014-12-27,EBAY,0.05220796912908554,0.9163764715194702,0.03141556307673454
Ebay,Buyer opened a case for unreceived package and we sort of resolved it through messages. Case not closed and money still on temporary hold.,A buyer opened a case because he did not receive the package but the tracking number confirmed it was delivered to him a week ago. I told him to check with neighbors and the post office. He eventually responded that he doesn't think it is my fault and thanks me for responding. I checked my paypal and the money is still on hold because the case is active. Should I message him and ask him to close the case? Or should I just wait until the case expires (if this is possible)?

Ebay,Cancelling a transaction before the buyer pays,"I had an auction and the winner is located outside of the US. ( the global shipping program was turned on by default and I didn't notice that when I listed the item)

So far the buyer has not paid nor responded.

I was wondering what could happen next if:

1. the buyer never responds or accepts the cancellation. Will I receive the final value fee automatically given a certain period of time? 

2. the buyer still pays eventually without accepting the cancellation request (not sure if this is possible) . Will the cancellation be auto completed after I refund the buyer ( or will the refund be processed automatically when there is an open cancellation request?)

Ebay,To any sellers w/ a buyer currently attempting a scam through INAD or claiming the item is broken: You're boned.,"You may remember me from my previous posts. Well, I'll cover it again just for kicks.

So a while ago, a buyer wins an auction for a ~$300 item. The day after he purchases it, he opens an item not received claim (don't know how he did this since you're supposed to be physically unable to until after the estimated delivery date) and refuses to close the claim even after we provide tracking information. 

He escalates it when it's 2 days late for delivery (HE HAD TRACKING INFORMATION!!!!) and lo and behold, it gets delivered and ebay closes the case.

Part 2.

The buyer has the item for 5 days, and messages us demanding feedback. He says he will only leave positive if we will, and I inform him that he can't leave feedback, and that he won't be getting any. Now he begins demanding a refund because it's suddenly broken since we wouldn't give him good feedback, and opens another claim when we refuse to give it to him.

We drag this claim out as long as possible. My mother calls ebay, they inform her not to do anything until he escalates this case and that we'll probably win, so we wait. Come Friday the 19th, the day he's able to escalate, he does, and my mom calls ebay yet again - this time, some other department I can't remember the name of the first guy told us to call. 

They basically tell her we're screwed and can't win because they 'have to protect the buyer.' This contradicted everything the first customer service rep told us. GG ebay.

So the buyer won the case, our money is floating around in the void, and 6 days after the case was closed he still hasn't shipped it back. I have no doubt we'll receive our $300 item smashed by a sledgehammer, or a brick, or a collection of rocks. We're going to be opening it on camera and report it to USPS for fraud if necessary, since ebay will do literally nothing even with video evidence.

I can't believe how ebay handles these things. Where's the seller protection? How is a buyer demanding feedback then opening a claim when we refuse to leave it not suspicious??

Give up, sellers. You'll lose.",0,5,2014-12-28,EBAY,0.06962861120700836,0.8968040943145752,0.033567287027835846

Ebay,"Sold new xbox one 2 weeks ago, buyer wants to return due to issues","Folks, looking for any assistance and advice here.

I sold a brand new unopened xbox one item through eBay. I have 100% positive rating and I would like to keep it that way. The buyer who purchased from me also has the same history. The purchase was made on Dec 06, 2014. My return policy for the item listing is to contact seller within 14 days for money back, buyer pays return shipping. The buyer contacted me today and specifically said that he wanted to contact me directly before filing a report with eBay that he tried plugging in his xbox and it does not work. I responded back to buyer and advised him to contact Microsoft Tech support located on the warranty brochure and check to see if they can determine it to be a defect or if it's something they can help to resolve. I also told him that in the meantime, I will see if there is anything else that can be done. 

At this point, per return policy, it is in my favor, but I've heard that eBay / paypal always sides on buyer for most things. What should I do? I do feel bad because if this happened to me, I would be really upset and want to try and help them out, but also have to think about the loss I would take. I actually bought the xbox unit through a newegg listing on ebay on the 24th of November and did not arrive until the 3rd of december.",5,2,2014-12-29,EBAY,0.04248593747615814,0.9180919528007507,0.0394221693277359

Ebay,"Zero feedback buyer just did ""buy it now"" on my $699 item - what should I do?","UPDATE / TL;DR - Buyer ended up being great; got my money and feedback. Chalk one up for ""every eBay user has to start somewhere"". Thanks for the reassurance, everyone!

I'm selling a Native Instruments Maschine drum machine + Komplete 9 software synthesizer bundle, and I have it up for $699 buy it now or best offer. I just had someone buy it now who has zero feedback and created his account 5 days ago (I started the 30-day fixed price sale 3 days ago). ~~He has not paid yet (I did not send an invoice because I wasn't sure if I should look for alternative options first)~~. His username seems like a spam username to me. I'm not sure if he's legit but just a brand new ebayer, a scam artist, or perhaps another competing seller just trying to get my item off the market.

How should I proceed? I am selling this in order to pay rent so I can't afford to get scammed and have the money tied up for 2 months and/or gone forever. I have been doing some quick googling and have been seeing that sometimes these zero feedback buyers will indeed pay for the item, but then file a complaint about it being broken when it ships.

What protections are in place for me? Should I go ahead ~~and invoice him~~ and proceed as if he were any other buyer? Should I contact him first in some way? Could I just contact him, tell him I am not selling to such a new and dubious account, and cancel the order / relist the item?

Thanks in advance - this did not occur to me when I put up the auction, so I did not make any mention of zero feedback buyers in the listing. I just want to make sure that I don't lose $700!

Ebay,"[Help Needed] Seller doesn't accept returns, what do I do if the item isn't as described?","The seller had a really bad picture so I asked for more and it was met with a rude reply which was warranted I suppose after I sent 3 messages with the last one saying I wouldn't pay until my questions were answered. I know I can't do that for real but it definitely made him reply. I waited 3 days (2 business days which is 1 too little for eBay's standards for the whole lack of a reply thing) and he finally replied today after that message. He's threatening to open a case already because I haven't paid after wanting a better description/pictures of the item *during* the bidding process. 

I also had one of those bidders come in and bid me up and then retract so I would have to pay more. How can I report them? I know it's against eBay's rules but they keep directing me back to the page with that rule every time I go to contact them. I wish I didn't have to pay the amount I was bid up to (my max bid had $10 or so over the first bid). 

So I have not gotten a single picture, better description, etc. of the shoes I have now bought and it seems I won't get better ones. The item was described shortly in the auction area and I can't tell if the shoes are from China or England. 

Any advice here? I'm paying in around 8 hours or so as I'm practically forced to and the 8 hour thing is pretty much the time it takes for him to be able to open a case.

It just seems a bit odd that there are no returns, the picture was very very shaky, and the item is not described well. I don't want to be scammed here or anything. He has positive feedback but that's mostly from the people he bought stuff from. There's negative and neutral feedback talking about how he doesn't ship and how the item didn't come as described.

Well you'll be delighted to know they were for my 9 year old son.  He's in 3rd grade and just recently did a geology project at school and was fascinated by it. The person who came in to give them a talk, brought each of them a few rocks, and so then he asked me if he could get some more different rocks, and this fit the bill perfectly!

When he was leaving positive feedback everyone of it was ""could have shipped faster!"", but the main one which make me worry about is negative left for him as a seller ""BEWARE&lt;HE IS A FRAUD, ,HE TAKE YOUR MONEY NO TV,DONT BID!!!!!!"".


I don't really want to worry and think about will he or not, leave me a negative feedback, which would have a big impact on my relative small feedback score, since I started selling a couple of month ago, so if he wins the auction, is there a way to cancel it or do something which won't allow him to leave me a negative feedback?",5,5,2014-12-30,EBAY,0.220123291015625,0.7474954128265381,0.032381292432546616
Ebay,Attempted Scam or something else? Can anyone figure this out.,"I drop shipped an item from a retailer for UPS 2nd Day Air and it arrived to the recipient on 12-22-14. Immediately after signature confirmation I recieve a return request message saying that they don't need it anymore. I declined the request because the listing had no return policy. The buyer sends another message pleading for a refund saying that his wife didn't like the present and that they are going to break up, and he's out of money because he used up all his savings. I went ahead and decided to do an exception for this transaction stating if everything checks out and I get the item back i'll refund the money back. 

So, I get the item delivered to me today via FEDEX and the outer box seems to be the manufacturer's box. I opened it up and then opened up the main item box to make sure I didn't get bricked or that everything was in it's unopened packaging. Everything appears to look new and untouched. I didn't see any traces of the retailer from where I originally purchased the item. After inspecting a bit, I find a small label affixed to the bottom of the outer box with a UPS Ground tracking # different than the one I was given(FEDEX) or My UPS 2nd Day Air tracking. It displays the same name and address that I originally shipped to, but the tracking shows that it shipped the same day the buyer received my drop shipped package. 

My tracking # shows departure scan from VA Beach at 12-19-14 and Arrival at buyer's address on 12-22-14

Ebay,Need some advice on a undelivered item.,"Country: UK

Have been on eBay for years for personal use but recently converted my account into a business one and have started selling wholesale jewellery. For the most part, I'm quite experienced on dealing with certain odd situations but not sure how to resolve this one.

So, I sold a necklace for £30 via Royal Mail 1st class Recorded Delivery (requires a signature that can be checked online). It was dispatched on the 17th December and this type of postage is 1-2 working days. However, the item is still undelivered and when I check the tracking number, it says Royal Mail still have the item.

I've checked Royal Mail's claims process and it says I can't claim until 15 working days have passed. This is fine, but I have a buyer who most likely is annoyed that he still hasn't got his item (he's just sent me a message to say it's still not there).

So my question is, how's best to deal with this situation? The item should have been delivered by now (obviously) and I can't start the claims process yet. But, I've got a customer to please, how should I approach this?

p.s. I've also noticed that Jewellery can't be claimed for unless a special next day delivery is used. This is a bit of a cop out if they have lost my item!!",2,2,2014-12-30,EBAY,0.03350599855184555,0.9234296679496765,0.04306434839963913
Ebay,"After 4 years of doing most of my business on eBay, I have decided to move more toward my own website and Amazon.com... Things have really gone down hill","Hey everyone,

I am more of a lurker to this section and notice many people post about moving off of eBay. For a while I just thought those situations were isolated and those sellers maybe doing something wrong. But as of recently I realized eBay is really going downhill, and they truly are making it difficult to be part of the top sellers on their site.

I hope many sellers are still doing well on eBay, but I cannot deal with the poor customer support and the rise of buyers trying to extort money from every transaction.

Ebay,Best way to combine shipping on cheap items?,"Here is the deal. I sell about 50 different items in my store. They are all very small and light. Most of these go for about $9.99 to $49.99 and I make out fine offering free shipping. I want to offer small add on's that go with the items, that will mostly be $0.99 to $2.99. I can clearly not offer these alone as shipping first class with tracking would eat up all the cost, so was thinking about doing them as $0.99 to $2.99 plus $2.25 shipping. I want to do it this way to keep anyone from buying just these items, but I want them to be able to add it with no extra shipping cost. How do I do this best?


So far I have tried two ways.

1.) A shipping promotional rule that allows for any multiple item purchase of greater than $3 to allow free shipping.

2.) Each additional item having a shipping cost of $2.25 less. I thought the second item would take the $2.25 shipping fee of the first item, and subtract $2.25 from that to make any multiple item purchase 0.


Checking out my store from another users account, neither worked right and both tried charging $2.25 for an order with the cheap item along with a $49.99 free shipping item.",9,1,2014-12-30,EBAY,0.029556261375546455,0.9214381575584412,0.049005571752786636

Ebay,Ebay Customer Support told me to go to Amazon,"This isn't an Ebay-hate thread. In fact, I'm so upset because I LIKE Ebay and I am still hopeful I can take advantage of the benefits of auctioning stuff online. 

However, I can't even begin to describe how awful their customer support is. I don't know if this is an isolated incident, but if they treat new users this way every on a regular basis, how do they ever expect to beat out Amazon?

The answer is that they simply don't expect to beat Amazon. In fact, they want Amazon to grow!

I created an account to sell a Pick 1/4 PS4 video game voucher that came with my PS4. A friend recommended I sell it over Ebay and gave it a shot. I added all my info, posted it up and wrote in the description that I'll send the code over a message. I decide to read the terms. It says I can sell digital games as long as I ship them the code. Oh shit! I edit the description to say that I'll ship them the code, but can provide it over message as well if they don't want to wait. I put it up at $15 as all the other codes listed were around that price. 

Then I received an email saying my account was suspended for appearing risky. I assumed it was because I'm a new user and never bought anything. I look up in the help section and it says I'm supposed to receive a message saying what I can do about the suspension. I check the inbox. Nada. I ask them to send me something. Still nada. 

So I call them up. A guy named Jed tells me that my account was suspended for suspicious activity. I asked him what I did wrong. He says that digital codes just aren't allowed on Ebay. I read him the line that explicitly says it IS allowed with physical shipping. He says there's other problems with the account. He says he can't say what because then I'll just go make another account. I ask him what I can do to appeal the suspension. He says nothing. I ask him if he just wants me to take my business elsewhere? He says that Amazon is available. I tell him WTF, how is he even allowed to send customers over to Amazon?? He says it's completely allowed to send UNWANTED customers over. I was at a loss. I told him to get me a supervisor. He says one will call me back. 

Supervisor Daniel calls me back. Daniel says that he went over the report and that I'm permanently suspended. I tell him that Jed told me to go to Amazon and that doesn't seem okay. He doesn't have a problem with it. I ask him if there's anything I can do? Provide credit card info, credit rating, background check, etc?? He says nope, they just don't want me to use Ebay. I am at a loss since I didn't do anything wrong and he says that 99% of people who are told why they were suspended create another account and he needs to prevent that. I tell him that by not giving me any venue to appeal or do anything about this ensures that I have no other recourse but to make another account, but if he gave me explanations and walked me through this service that I am new to, I would be able to become a productive member of the community with the handle that they are already monitoring. 

He says ""I understand, but we just want you to use another venue. Goodbye."" I tell him this is ridiculous and I need another superior. He tells me he's the highest they have. I remind him that he called a complaining customer personally and has stayed on the phone for 15 minutes with him, which means he is NOT the highest on the chain. He insists that he is, until he eventually caves and says he'll put on his manager. 

I talk to the manager. Forgot to get his name. He tells me that this happens all the time and that I can file an appeal, but that nothing will be done and that Daniel was just trying to save time by telling me to go. He tells me that if I don't like Amazon, there are plenty of other services I can use. I tell him I want to use EBAY. He says that won't be possible. I ask him WHY?? He says he doesn't know. 

I wasn't expecting that. What do you mean ""you don't know?"" 

He says that once a new account is suspended, it's pretty much over. There's really nothing you can do. It could have been suspended in error, but it doesn't matter. There's no such process that will reverse that decision. 

I am completely shocked at this development. How could Ebay be so disorganized? I ask him if he wants me to resort to making a new account. He tells me absolutely not, and that if I did, they'll find me. He again tells me to go to Amazon, and that ""I can get just as good of a service there as I can on Ebay""

What-the-fucking-fuck??? 

I hung up. I wrote down my case-id before doing so in case I call again. Although I frankly have no idea what even to do. I didn't do anything wrong except be a new user. I don't even know how people are able to survive their screening process when it basically goes ""If he's new, he's a scammer!"" 

But more importantly, I had absolutely no idea that Ebay was such an Amazon fan that they turn away all complaining users to the service. If I didn't know better, I'd imagine Amazon is sponsoring them in some way. 

**TL:DR** Opened an account. Tried selling something. Got immediately suspended without explanation. Called customer service. Three different people told me to go to Amazon instead. The latter of which emphasized that their service was just as good. WTF?",0,2,2014-12-31,EBAY,0.38151098787784576,0.5942542999982834,0.024234740994870663

Ebay,HTML question. I've just started an eBay store to compliment my website. The HTML in the description doesn't seem to be formatting like I want it to.,"I tried using an eBay description checker tool I found online and it seemed to work fine, but just not on eBay and I'm not sure why. It's pretty basic HTML.

Ebay,Advice: How to ship stickers.,"Hello all,

I recently bought some stickers to sell on ebay cheap. I am planning on shipping them through a regular mail envelope with a small, thin cardboard sleeve protecting the sticker inside. 

However, I am unsure if this would be an okay method.",4,1,2014-12-31,EBAY,0.018445439636707306,0.8737969398498535,0.10775763541460037
Ebay,Possible buyer scam(s)?,"Hi all,

Wondering if I am being held up by some type of scammer...or just someone who is incompetent.

I listed my XBox 360 bundle on eBay, the auction ended on 12/22 and after a few days, I had a pending transaction in my PayPal via eCheck for the item + shipping costs. I told the buyer that I'd ship the items as soon as the payment cleared. 

On 12/28, I log into PayPal to see that the buyer has canceled the payment. I messaged her on eBay and she said it was ""an issue with her bank and she would pay after work."" Today, I messaged her and told her I would be opening an unpaid item case if she didn't send payment. 

She now just messaged me and said she was ready to pay, but that when she won the auction, it said shipping was free. I've always had shipping at a fixed cost of $35 for the auction. The closed auction page lists $35 as the shipping cost. She replies by sending me ""screenshots"" she had when she won the bid, showing the item cost + ""free shipping.""

I have no idea where these screens came from, but she is saying she won't pay for shipping, because ""it was free before.""

WTF?

Is it at all possible that the listing said shipping was free when she won? I'm assuming this is some type of scam. I've opened an unpaid item case so far...not sure what I should do next. What can she do? I just started using my eBay account again to sell things before I move...will she be able to leave any type of negative comments on my profile, if I continue with the non-payment case?

Thanks in advance...",0,1,2014-12-31,EBAY,0.09931063652038574,0.8744966387748718,0.026192735880613327
Ebay,Questions about shipping and delivery times.,"So, while creating a listing, and selecting the shipping services, I chose economy shipping parcel select 2-9 days shipping. After i create the listing and when I look at my listing it says ""Delivery in 4 days!""
