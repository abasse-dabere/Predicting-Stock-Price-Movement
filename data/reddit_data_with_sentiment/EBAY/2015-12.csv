Ebay,"Left Seller negative feedback and they messaged me with my home address and ""see you soon""","I won an auction for a high-end mtg card, and paid for it via PayPal literally within minutes. Three weeks later, I did not receive the card (seller kept saying he was a new ebayer and needed to wait for my payment to clear). I proceeded to open a case with Ebay and the seller then canceled the purchase, saying that I delayed his receipt of the funds by even longer, and he was going to sell the card to someone ""more deserving"". 

I left negative feedback and this morning got a message from the seller with my home address and ""see you soon"". I called Ebay and they said thanks for letting them know, but there would be no follow-up with me.

Ebay,"Sold an item, afraid I'm going to be scammed","Hi all! 

I've recently started helping my (hoarder) mom sell some of her things to help clean her life up. Prior to this, I've only ever sold one thing on eBay and it went smoothly. 

I'm trying to sell a $275 pair of boots for her that she's never worn and are still new, with box, original packaging, certificate of authenticity, keychain (yep, a keychain model of the boot!) and dust cover. The only defect is that the box has sat in a closet for a few years and has taken some wear from moving, but everything else is immaculate. I've listed them a few times but they didn't sell. 

Last week I listed them for $229 with a buy it now of $299. A few days into the auction, someone across the country bought the boots for the $299. Stoked, I waited for payment and then shipped them off. Since my paypal is still new, the funds were never released to me, so although the buyer paid shipping, I had to buy shipping in hopes of reimbursing myself. 

Last night I got an email from the lady demanding a full refund and for me to pay return shipping. She's stating the boots are knockoffs and that I'm trying to be fraudulent. She believes the boots are fake because she has another pair of the exact same boots and they are not the same. I know my mom bought these from the manufacturer and that they aren't fakes, so in afraid she'll switch them out or take some of the accessories, and I'll be out $300 plus $40 shipping to her and $40 return. 

What can I do? If anything. 


[EDIT] first, this is the original message the buyer sent me wit hint minutes of the package being confirmed as delivered. 

&gt;Shoes are not authentic. I do not need your explanation trying to verify authenticity because I own another pair of these exact boots that are 100% authentic. If you choose to NOT ACCEPT my return I WILL write a very bad review for you in paragraph form. Otherwise, ebay will be contacted tomorrow morning and I will get my money back. My return shipping MUST be included. This is FRAUD. I own the ORIGINAL AUTHENTIC PAIR ALREADY AND KNOW A FAKE FROM A REAL.

Second, I talked to eBay and the escalation team member sounded somewhat hopeful for me. I provided a thorough explanation of the item with detailed pictures and the return message was threatening extortion. The employee said I had the right to ask for pictures and an explanation of why she believes the boots are not authentic. I should try to work something out but after 3 days, eBay can step in. 

I'm not going to hold my breath for a positive outcome on my end, but I'm hoping just a little bit. 

Thank you all for your help and advice. As a new eBayer, I truly do appreciate it. 

[EDIT2] [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/6Ko07) an album of the photos I posted to the eBay item page. 

One of the things she's upset about is seen the ~9th picture down of the heel of the boot where it is branded with the company's logo. She's stating that because the material is a lighter material (and on her boots, it's black) they're knockoff. She did provide me with pictures of both items and I can see exactly what she's talking about.

[EDIT3] We've come to an agreement and she's going to send me the boots back. She did send me photos of the differences between the boots which I can compare to my original photos if they happen to be different. I don't think I'm being scammed, but it does suck that I'm out ~$40 for shipping them. Now I just have to figure out whether or not these are knockoffs or not. /Awesome",15,3,2015-12-01,EBAY,0.05018775165081024,0.9149946570396423,0.03481755033135414

Ebay,New account (5 days old) outbids himself over $100. Scam?,"I am selling an iPad 2 (3G, 64GB) and within the last five minutes of auction I see the bid skyrocket from $180 to $305.

Ebay,Confused about how I should handle a return request.,"I've been selling a lot of used lego on ebay. In all my listings I've included detailed photographs and descriptions of what I have to offer. I don't offer returns. 

Anyways, a woman opened up a return request, unhappy that the item isn't brand new in box. She opened a "" Doesn't match description or photos"" claim. I never said anything stating the item was new in box. She even included photos of her opening the item, with the item being EXACTLY as I described it and pictured it. 

I responded to her, saying I'm not sure why she would think the item was new in box, and sorry but I don't do returns.

Ebay,Seller keeps canceling order,"Hi there. I recently found an item I wanted on eBay, made an offer, the offer was accepted, I paid for the item, and then later that day the seller refunded my money stating they can't afford the shipping. The seller relisted the item with shipping increased from $20 to $40. I made an offer, and the seller accepted the offer once again. Then later that day, same exact thing: order canceled, seller refunded my money and left a message saying ""I can't afford to lose money shipping it... It would cost me $50."" Keep in mind, both the seller and I are in the USA and not some continental shipping option. 

Question is: can I leave negative feedback for him? If so, should I? Personally, I find this to be extremely unprofessional. When I sell on eBay, I always let the shipping calculator figure out costs, and even when I've taken a small hit on shipping, I eat the cost.

This smells like the ""I'm a pastor ship it to my niece"" crap I get on craigslist all the time (formal weird English).

My understanding is that ebay is very buyer oriented and as a seller I can get screwed on this if I don't watch myself.

Ebay,What is the etiquette here? Someone bought my item as I was negotiating through 'make an offer',"I recently listed an item for $60 on eBay. This afternoon I got an offer for $50. I countered at $55. The buyer offered $52.50 and I rejected it; she then sent a note about how she really wanted the item, couldn't do more than $52.50, etc, and I'm soft so I caved even though I wasn't too eager about it. I couldn't find out how to settle at $52.50 -- I had rejected it already and it didn't seem like eBay would let me accept it now -- so I told the buyer to resubmit the offer. 

Half an hour later or so, I go to check my email and I have an item sold notification. I opened it to find that my item sold at $60, the originally listed price. It took me a bit to figure out that this was a second buyer who'd just purchased my item, after the first buyer resubmitted an offer of $52.50 but before I could accept hers. Now the first buyer is giving me grief, but it doesn't seem right to cancel the second buyer's purchase. I admit that I'm actually kind of happy someone else purchased at listed price, though if I had had the option, I would've rejected it since I'd already agreed to $52.50.

Ebay,"Sold a brand new camera lens on eBay, buyer said not as described, Ebay forced a return, buyer never shipped, Ebay refunded him anyway","I shipped a fairly expensive camera lens that I'd used for an hour (but was basically brand new) to a buyer. Shortly after the lens was delivered he disputed the case as an ""item not described"". He claimed the lens was scratched and posted a picture showing the lens. There was no visible scratch.

Ebay forced the return. I called to complain about having to pay for return shipping and worried about the veracity of the claim. Was told that they would issue a shipping label and I'd have to pay for it. Great.

Then the status of the case switched to ON HOLD. Every time I logged in it said waiting on the buyer. He never shipped anything back. 

Today eBay refunded everything to him. I got notes that my PayPal account was over-drawn. American Express messaged me saying that they had an unapproved charge from PayPal.

I called eBay. They said that the buyer had trouble printing their label so I needed to provide one. When their system said the case was ""ON HOLD / Waiting for Buyer"" that implied that I needed to send him a separate shipping label. Since I didn't do that, they simply refunded him the money and let him keep the lens. Case closed. SOL. They told me I could request the buyer's contact info and call or email him and try to get him to return the lens to me, but....

The phone operator wouldn't escalate the case further. I reported the buyer through eBay. Obviously this is why no one should ever sell through eBay, but...

Ebay,Crazy Buyer,"I hate typing this, I'm mobile. Have mercy.  

I sold a laptop on eBay, the buyer, messages me after the auction ended and he wanted to send me a shipping label. He wasn't happy with the shipping method or cost. (UPS 3 Day).  I told him that I wasn't comfortable with that, I'd be shipping it myself. He wasn't happy with that, I offered to cancel the transaction so I could relist and move on as he hasn't paid and it wasn't looking good. He immediately posts a negative feedback and goes on a rant...
I told him that I wasn't comfortable proceeding, and I immediately called eBay because this is a bit too much for thirty minutes after an auction ends. They were as helpful as you can imagine. 
During the call, he pays and says ""send it, its mine"". Then he follows with a message telling me to ship it USPS, the cheapest way possible and refund the difference... I stopped responding because I'm sick of his messages, trying to dictate the whole transaction, rude comments and remarks  
Today, he messages me again wanting to know if it shipped... I responded and just told him as the auction states, handling time is two business days and I'm going to have to repackage since he refuses UPS .... He fires back, I already paid just ship it!!  I'm really getting hot, he keeps going back and forth and at this point I don't want to ship it or continue because he is being shady..I think he would just smash it and file a claim. Idk what to do. I've had over 90 messages in two days.",18,4,2015-12-04,EBAY,0.10700254887342453,0.8638795018196106,0.02911795675754547
Ebay,I have an item not received open on me. What happens now?,"I sent an item from Canada to the U.S., I shipped it next day, paid for 4 day shipping.  I uploaded the tracking the next day - but it's been 17 days (including weekends) now and the buyer said they haven't got it yet, that it was a gift for their granddaughter, and now the birthday has past.  

Looks like it got stuck in the USPS facility in Chicago for like 2 weeks....customs?  Never had it happen before.  But the website updated today to say that it's in the buyers home city now.  It should be delivered Friday, or worst Monday.  I don't think I did anything wrong.  I packed it nicely, shipped it on time, paid for the proper 4 day shipping.    

What happens here?  Am I going to get a defect?  Can I get Ebay to remove any negative feedback?  Paypal has my money on hold...it obviously will get delivered.  When will they release the hold?

Ebay,"Buyer buys a new photo printer. Claims it's been used when they receive it, claims there is already ink installed, and wants a refund based on these false claims. Help?","I recently sold a new-in-the-box printer to someone.  It had never been used.  Even the cords were sealed in their original plastic bags.  My buyer claims that the printer was used, has ink inside of it, and makes a rattling sound from something broken internally. These things are false.  If there is ink inside of it, it's from ink that my buyer purchased and installed themselves!

My buyer says: ""The listing was for a new unused printer but I received the used one which has ink installed in it. There is some noise coming from the printer, I am guessing some broken part. Please send me the return label to ship this back.""  There was no used printer; it was new although in an unsealed box, which I had been very clear about in my original listing. 

I'm afraid that this buyer is trying to take advantage of a new seller.  I am not wanting to issue a refund for this because their claims are 100% false.  How should I proceed?

Furthermore, if I did issue a refund and let them ship this printer back to me, I'd be getting a (now) used printer with ink THEY installed that I can't sell as easily!

Edit: e-Bay has sent me a message requesting that I refund the buyer within two business days.  I see that I have the option to offer a partial refund, and the buyer would keep the (now) used and broken printer.  Should I do that?

Ebay,Payment still pending after manual release,"I recently sold an item for about $1100 as a second chance offer after the first buyer was found to be fraudulent. The item was shipped and delivered on November 27 according to USPS. Everything went smoothly; however, the payment that I received is still pending in PayPal, even though it has been much more than three days after delivery.

About three days ago I called eBay support, and I was told that the support specialist would request a ""manual release"" of the funds and that I should receive the funds within 24 hours. Nothing happened, so I called again two days later. Again I was told that they would fix it and that I should receive the funds within 24 hours. So today I waited for the funds to be released, but to my dismay they are still in my pending PayPal balance.

I called support again about a half hour ago, and I was told that they would try manually releasing funds and that I should receive my payment within 24 hours. Needless to say, I'm not very convinced that the payment will be released. Paypal reports that I should receive my payment on the 13th of December, but that date is different from the one eBay reports (Dec 7th). Also, when I try to view my ""Estimated Funds Availability"" date on the classic PayPal site, I just see ""Try Later.""

Ebay,"Sold an item, buyer telling me he's locked out of his account, don't want to be scammed","Hey fellas. Decently green when it comes to eBay so I'm worried about this recent item I sold. 

I listed a 1st gen iPad for sale. Started bidding at $30, BIN at $100. Bidding ended at $91. The user who won it has a 300 feedback score and all are recent and positive. The user also sent me a message about the item prior to bidding, asking about the condition and if it came with the charger and box. I responded to those messages and they replied back, then bid. 

Now, this user won the item about 10 days ago. I send multiple messages asking when I should expect payment. Just today I got a message on eBay from said user, saying they were ""locked out of their eBay account"" and gave me an email to send a ""payment request"" to via PayPal. 

So, I think it's a scam, but I don't know for sure. It sounds sketchy, and they claim to be locked out of their eBay account, yet I got a message on eBay from them?

However, they are a very active user with good feedback and have been a member since 2004. But I'm not taking any action until I hear from you experts.

Ebay,Buyer says her kid purchased item - 2 days after it shipped! [Update],"I sold an item of clothing recently for near $400. Two days after, on the day of its' arrival, I received a message from the buyer claiming the item was an order by her kid. See her message on the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3vspcv/buyer_says_her_kid_purchased_item_2_days_after_it/) here. 
I have a no returns policy and would not like to lose out on the hefty shipping/final value fees, obviously I would not like to be scammed.

[Update] As of yesterday she has signed for and accepted the package. This morning I received a second message:

Ebay,"I found and reported some fraudsters but nothing was done, now either ebay customers or paypal are out £1000s","I found a series of fraudsters on eBay selling DJ equipment from China. There was no reason for them to have 100 of them in China, because it is made in Germany and at the least they wouldnt be able to sell it at 1/8th of the price if it was imported. Plus, all 50-100 over 5 or 10 sellers all had the same pictures, title, listings, etc.
So I reported them all and was told that ebay would deal with it(as per usual, but I assumed they wouldnt). I followed all the sellers and about a three weeks to a month later I saw negative feedback start rolling in for the sellers, with no positive at all. Bare in mind that all of these sellers had 0 feedback.
So basically 50 - 100 ebayers are out like £50 each because I know paypal / ebay will not want to pay this out 'cause its thousands and thousands of pounds or theyll take the hit themselves.
The reason I knew for a fact this was a scam is because I risked it before for I think £30, and it took months of harassment to get my money back. They didnt want to refund any of the other buyers that time but I, completely by coincidence got talking to another one of the buyers on a forum who confirmed to me that paypal would not give him his money back either. Ebay even removed all 10 sellers negative feedback that time. I think so other buyers couldnt see that we'd all been scammed.

Ebay,Buyer says her kid purchased item - 2 days after it shipped! [Update 2 Chargeback],"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3vy4f8/buyer_says_her_kid_purchased_item_2_days_after_it/) You've given great help so far, I'll keep you all in the loop with the latest development. Here is a little backstory first:
I sold an item of clothing recently for around $400 and 2 days after the sale, the day of delivery, I get this message from the buyer:


*I need to contact u because i did not aprove these ...it was my 13 year old son i just find out cause of my bank account. Sorry about those ..i will return ur package let me know how to return it*


That day the buyer accepts delivery of the package, and the funds are safe and sound in my Paypal account. I feel as though my obligations are complete, that nothing good would come from my entering this situation, and ideally I'd like to keep the money and not accept a return as to be out my final value fees &amp; risk being scammed. I have a no returns policy. 
The next day I receive this message from the buyer:


*I leave u a massege yesterday i need to return ur packagr i dont want these like i tell u before ny child is undar age and uder with out my concern ....i will never paid $379 for something like that i already report my bank im assuming that u want ur iteam back ...got here today 12/8/15*


I continue on doing nothing as I don't know how to proceed. Generally my rule on eBay is to treat seller disputes somewhat like interactions with the police; Say little as possible since anything can/will be used against you.

Today I see this email and an open case on my Paypal account:

*We are writing to let you know that a payment you received was reversed by the sender's bank.
The transaction may be covered if it is marked as eligible on the Transaction Details page and you provide us with an online tracking number or proof of shipment.*

*We'll accept any documentation that shows the shipping date, the shipping address, and official acceptance (like a postmark or receipt) from the shipping company. Proof of delivery is an acceptable alternative to proof of shipment.*

I do not have a physical receipt as I printed my label and dropped the package at the post-office. I do have the tracking number and as the item exceeds $250 I purchased signature confirmation as well (the signature is in the name of someone other than the buyer, I'm not sure if this will make me lose a case). 
The buyer has also admitted she received the package in message two. I am unsure of how to proceed. 

Am I to call Paypal, perhaps simply upload screenshot of delivery and the online tracking #? Worst case scenario at this point is that I'm out both my funds, my item plus stuck with a charge-back fee. I have until December 19th to respond before I automatically lose the dispute.

 I do feel as though I am in a good position to make a stand however I'd like to know how to handle this correctly - Thank you again for the help.",14,12,2015-12-09,EBAY,0.05344359576702118,0.916348934173584,0.030207514762878418

So what do I do? Do I cancel the transaction? Do I wait the 4 days or whatever and close the case? Or do I tell her to cancel the transaction? I just want to be sure I don't end up with any bad marks for her screw up.

I did already block her (or her kids or whoever).

Ebay,Paying for Shipping Labels via CC. Anyone find an easier way then back up funds?,"I'm a fan of getting points on my credit card so I try and direct everything into it. One big expenditure is shipping labels. I go through eBays labels.

If you looked into this you know that you can absolutely pay your Fees via credit card. So Fedex fees get tossed in with that.

However, for USPS in order for your shipping labels to be bought they go through Paypal Balance first. In order for it to get charged to your credit card, the balance has to be 0 and your backup funding has to be your card.

This gets pretty shitty when you add in Paypal Working Capital and it's automatic withdraws. If your balance is 0 then PWC tells you it had a problem taking money and a rep told me that it affects the mathematical chance of a future loan. Well that's not good.

I just checked out Paypals multi order shipping labels, but the funding source again is the balance and it doesn't look like you can change it.

Ebay,"Shipped item, says delivered, but buyer did not receive","Hello,

I shipped an item about 2 weeks ago and got a message from the buyer last night that it was never received. The tracking is peculiar, the location is accurate up until the final delivered entry. It goes from the shipping location, to every point between, to finally the buyers PO, then out for delivery at the buyers city, then finally delivered.. But the delivery location is the shipped location. It's very strange, and I'm convinced it's an issue with USPS.

That being said, the buyer has requested a refund. I responded that I would contact USPS and to check with whoever might receive their mail (they live in an apartment building). Buyer said that a desk clerk will typically accept packages larger than that which would fit in the cluster unit. This package was larger than the standard box.

Buyer has now said that regardless of the outcome of the USPS investigation, they would like a refund as it was for a birthday party on the day they contacted me.

I don't have a problem dispensing a refund once the item is back in my hands, but as of now it's effectively lost. The buyers initial contact was with a case being opened, so there's a deadline now. As far as I know the shipment could end up with the buyer or myself at any point.

Ebay,Trying to cancel a transaction with an 'American' located in the Russian Federation,"Hi guys,

I recently put some high end electronics up for sale (worth around $550).

I didn't know about buyer preferences and listed an item via the quick listing tool. The default behaviour is to not require (or even let you enable) immediate payment upon 'Buy it Now'. If I had known I would have used the advanced tool - you get a full page asking you to choose if you use eBay.com but not eBay.com.au which only has some small text linking to it.

Now I have a customer (new account made within the last five days) who has won the transaction, not paid, is 'American' but has an address located in the Russian Federation. 

I've requested to cancel the order with the option ""there's an issue with the buyers address"" and I have a message from eBay saying ""You agreed to cancel this order"". Does this mean that the buyer requested a cancel too? What happens now? I understand that I should have waited and filed an 'unpaid' claim but even if they paid, I don't feel comfortable shipping to Russia (no way I'll be able to get insurance on the package) and the item I'm selling is pretty time critical (it might not be worth anything in two weeks).",2,3,2015-12-11,EBAY,0.05488468334078789,0.9101355075836182,0.034979742020368576

**Current bid**: $500

**My Maximum bid**: $650

I'm assuming the person who was in first place before me (Person A) was just notified that they've been outbid.  Let's say their personal max is **$700**. Does Ebay automatically up the bid for them after I just stole it? If so, does it do so by the lowest possible amount, or does the bid automatically jump up to their Max bid after I outbid them?

Ebay,Buyer wants to return an item due to finding a lower price. Do I have any obligation to accept this request? I stated no returns on the listing.,"I sold an item last week which the buyer has received.  She opened a refund request stating that she ""found a lower price"".  Now I explicitly stated that I do not accept returns and all sales are final.  I realize that this doesn't mean much if a customer files a SNAD case with Ebay though.  

What are my options here?  Will Ebay side with me since the buyer has already stated that her reason for a refund is because of the pricing, and not an issue with actual item?  What happens if the buyer then opens a SNAD case (can she do this after I decline the return?)?  This is my first time dealing with a return request in 150+ transactions and I'm unsure as to how to proceed.",16,17,2015-12-12,EBAY,0.10784697532653809,0.8645427227020264,0.027610285207629204
Ebay,First time selling - Having an issue with buyer,"This is my first time selling an item on ebay.  I just sold 2 brand new in box sealed smartphones.  I listed them today and some person bought them both one after another.  She then paid for both coming to around $760.  I was happy my items sold, and I messaged her and told her congratulations and that I will ship them out shortly.  She had ~100 feedback, all 100% positive.

Wanting to be a good/fast shipper, I went this evening and shipped them together with priority mail with tracking (I paid shipping).  Then I came home and to my horror she had just messaged me minutes before, stating she only needed 1 and that she ordered 2 by mistake.  I told her that unfortunately I had already shipped the items and am unable to modify the order anymore.  I did have my listing set as no-returns accepted.  I haven't heard back from her yet, but it just seems odd that someone could purchase 2 items, and pay for both, without realizing how much they are buying.  Especially at that kind of price ($380 each).

Now I am very worried.  I do not want to return the item, because I specifically made sure it was listed as no returns, and I really need the money as soon as possible, and don't want to have to wait for it to get back to me, and then relist it and jump through more hoops etc etc.  I just wanted to sell the items and be done with it.  I am of the mindset that it's probably more a case of buyers remorse, due to her going through all the checkout process, agreeing to pay for the items at the cost, reviewing the order, etc.  And not only that but I'm sure she could easily resell the item herself on ebay, for what she paid for it, if she doesn't want to keep it.

So realistically what are my options here?  Am I safe to just tell her she bought them and it's hers?  Will ebay side with me?  And like what if she decides to get the item and then smash it or something?  Am I going to be out all my money?  My shipping receipt says it's only insured for $50.  Maybe I am overthinking worst case scenarios here, but I am just a dude who needs the money for Christmas expenses for my family, and am now terrified that I might be having a big Christmas disaster instead.

Ebay,"Bestbuy messed up a AT&amp;T phone serial number I sold. I had it fixed but the buyer still insists the phone is stolen and doesn't work and has opened a Paypal case, what can I do?","Essentially I had purchased a phone from Bestbuy and sold it on eBay(brand new condition). The buyer I sold it to contact me saying AT&amp;T told him it can't be activated as Bestbuy still owns it(i.e. stolen). The buyer gave me the serial of the phone and sure enough the serial in the order was 2 numbers longer than the serial on the actual packaging. I called Best Buy mobile and the rep was able to fix the error and he even verified for me that the phone previously showed an activation error but that their system now shows it can be activated.

So I relayed the information to the buyer that it's basically fixed now and to retry activation. Buyer proceeds to say something about how he's going to get charged again for activation and he's not going to pay for that? I told him sorry but I can't help him with that as that would be an AT&amp;T thing. He then insists that the phone is stolen. Oddly he didn't state that he tried to activate it again, just insisting that its stolen and can't be activated without proof of purchase and he wants a refund. He opens a case on eBay with the reason as ""external damage"" and has his whole stolen phone reasoning. I reject the claim citing that there was simply a serial number error and that the phone was fixed and that proof of purchase can be provided if needed. 

I guess he didn't like that and he then opened a similar case through Paypal instead with the same ""external damage"" reasoning. I reject the refund and reply with the same thing this time with the Best Buy order number and serial number of the phone as well as saying I have proof of purchase and will provide if needed. He then escalated the case and I have responded again providing as much information as I can.

Ebay,"Bought a camera that arrived damaged, seller is stalling - Advice?","Hi everyone. So I recently bought a camera off eBay. The listing stated it was barely used, and in like-new condition. I get it to find a completely opposite description. I'm kind of shocked since the seller has well over 100 positive feedback ratings left for him and he has been a member for a long time.

Anyways the shutter button works periodically, whenever it wants, and not even an hour after trying to get the shutter button unstuck (by only pressing it to try to take photos - no abuse), the spring that sends the mirror back down broke.

So I first contacted the seller and informed him of the button. I informed him FedEx kind of threw/slid the parcel across my porch upon delivery. I also informed him that after the camera became stuck and kept taking photos that the mirror spring broke - immediately after this happened in real time. He said he'd open a claim with FedEx as I suggested it may have been damaged in shipping - giving him the benefit of the doubt. 

I sent him photos of the camera, including some views he didn't show in the listing. Not surprisingly some screws look stripped - hopefully I won't be accused of trying to scam him by ""purposely breaking it"". They weren't visible in the auction as they were hidden under the body cap. They were visible in the proof photos and video I had sent him of the camera button and mirror malfunctioning. He accepted the proof. Could have been a manufacturing defect, I don't know. The warranty card wasn't completed by an authorized Canon seller and was in the box blank, so I don't know the history of the camera.

The problem is, I used Pay After Delivery, so I used PayPal's dispute system in order to open a claim so that my bank account didn't get dinged for a faulty useless camera. He wants to stall it until the FedEx claim is over, but I don't want to get screwed out of roughly $300. 

Should I work with him on the FedEx claim or should I push PayPal to pursue in their claim? I asked the seller if I can return it and he's avoiding responding to that. He has not responded to the PayPal dispute, but he talks to me. It's been open since the 10th. It was escalated to a claim.

Regarding the packaging, he threw it all into the original box, shoved it into another box where it could slide side-to-side. No padding or anything. Just opening the tape with my knife damaged the camera box a little, that's how well it was packed. Camera was able to bounce a little in the original box.

Originally I was going to make a deal with him to get a half refund and send it to a repair shop until the spring broke, and that was when I became uncomfortable with the item.

This is my first major issue I've had on eBay. I've sold a few expensive things, bought a few expensive things and I've only been a member for 3 months. No issues until now. It's racking up my nerves,  I don't want to be out of $300.

Your advice would be helpful and appreciated.

So, how do you deal with this or similar cases? I'm interested in hearing how others choose to deal with these buyers. Is it a case by case basis? Depending whether they've left feedback?",11,3,2015-12-14,EBAY,0.05184298753738403,0.9024052023887634,0.04575177654623985

Ebay,"Listed an item for Auction, 1 day left and I may be selling it through craigslist tonight. Thoughts?","Hi everyone,

I don't sell a lot on ebay but do sell occasionally.  I listed a MacBook pro for auction, and it currently has 1 day left and is at over $700 dollars.  Someone recently reached out to me on craigslist so there is a high chance I sell the item tonight in person (Which I would 1000% prefer).  Do I cancel the item on ebay and pay the $70 dollar fee for cancelling, or just let the item auction finish and not ship the item out.  I know both are crappy things to do, but I'd like to not pay a fee if possible.

Thanks.",14,2,2015-12-14,EBAY,0.028086723759770393,0.9208999276161194,0.051013410091400146
Ebay,Question about shipping. (from someone inexperienced),"I'm going to make myself look very dumb here, but keep in mind I've never shipped an item before and am only 19 yrs old. And no, no one ordered anything from me so don't worry.

Ebay,Do I have a claim or am I just an idiot?,"Hey guys, bear with me because I had a brain fart or something. I bought some tape listed as ""packing/shipping tape"", and the picture on the listing showed average size packing/shipping tape rolls, and I was like, great! So I bought it, and what arrives is regular dollar store tape. Since you can't seal a package with tiny tape rolls, I don't understand how that could be considered shipping/packing tape. Now the seller had in the title 3/4"" but I thought they meant 3/4"", so I guess they have everything covered. But I feel the tape was misrepresented by the picture and the title. This is definitely my fuck-up I guess for not asking them for clarification, but are they also at fault for not making it clear what I was getting?",4,2,2015-12-14,EBAY,0.02749548852443695,0.9168686270713806,0.055635903030633926
Ebay,Is this eBay buyer trying to scam me or something?,"I have a buyer that bought a broken iPhone a month or two back (backlight is fucked). Before I sold, I made sure to disable the iCloud lock. Suddenly, I get a return request, with the buyer claiming the activation lock is on. He even included the serial and IMEI. Checked both myself, device is NOT iCloud locked, device is NOT blacklisted, there isn't a thing wrong with this phone. So what could this be about? This iPhone used to belong to my manager and he already got all of the cash from the sale, and I don't even have $100 to my name to accept a return.

Ebay,HUGE TIP FOR UNFAIR CASES OPEN! Call and ask for appeals department instead of case resolution department!,"So I recently had an unfair case opened on me for my shoes not as described. I spent an hour in the case resolution department (which they did not speak English well) and was transferred to the appeals department for some reason. There (they were American) I was given great advise on how to build evidence for my case to help me. I then got more evidence and had myself transferred back to the appeals department. I found out today that appeals can also work on current cases. There, the rep listened (yes, actually listened) to my side of the case and read our correspondence. He then concluded that there is no way that I should be responsible and escalated my case in my favor. It took some time to describe the situation but they are willing to listen as long as you are polite and calm. They are also very friendly and willing to help. I just wanted everyone to know just in case you are stuck just like I was. This community has helped me and I just want to pay it back in a way.

Ebay,"Buyer wore shoes to ""try them on"" then says there are marks and wants a return. First eBay rep was no help even with clear proof and pictures from buyer. What should I do?","So to try make this short, I sold a fairly expensive pair of Nikes and the buyer claims they have marks and are defective. There were no marks when I sent them. But then after he clearly states that he tried them on and wore them. He then shows pictures of the extra laces included cut off of its plastic tab. This I feel as if it is removing the tags. He also has pictures of the shoe stretched out and tied still. I thought that should be clearly enough evidence and I should be better than good. I called and the first rep was no help. I was then transferred to the supervisor. He then went on to tell me that ""It's the customers right to test and wear the product to see if they want it. They are able to return it then."" I want to add I also do not accept returns. Even though I'm aware eBay will force returns when needed I thought they would side with clear proof of a scam. He went on for thirty minutes. I asked for someone higher up and he said he was the highest. I ended up telling him that I will call at a different time to solve this. So do I roll over and take a $200 loss and a defect or do I keep trying until I hopefully get someone with logic? I feel like this rep was completely wrong but I don't want to waste even more time if I'll get the same answer.

Ebay,"About to be scammed, anything I can do? (UK)","**TL;DR:** Sent an item to different address than the one registered on paypal, is there anything I can do? 

So it's been a long time since I've sold anything on eBay, and recently I sold something for around £250. The buyer sent a message via eBay to send to a different address, so like an idiot I sent it to a different address than the one registered on paypal. 

Now I'm finally getting around to checking up on my paypal payment, which is marked 'pending'. I'm pretty sure the buyer is going to claim the package wasn't delivered and then withhold payment. 

Is there anything I can do? I haven't opened a dispute on eBay or anything so as far as the 'buyer' is concerned I don't know what's happening yet. 

As a side note I had to relist the auction several times due to non paying bidders and time wasters... I think I'm going to look into eBay alternatives from now on, I can't be bothered to deal with this kind of crap again. 

I have the message he sent me on eBay asking for the item to be sent to the new address if that helps. Planning on going to the police if eBay and Paypal don't help. 

Edit: so all I can do now is wait for him to claim the item hasn't been shipped; he hasn't filed anything so I guess we just play the waiting game. Will keep this updated as to what happens next. 

EDIT 2 16th Dec 2015: Holy crap, it's a Christmas miracle you guys, the payment on Paypal just cleared out of nowhere... It said it was going to clear on the 22nd so something must have happened in the meantime, maybe he gave me good feedback and I didn't get notified or something. Either way stoked! Thanks for everyone's advice, will never send a package anywhere but the official address again. Hoping I haven't missed something but looks like it worked.",17,5,2015-12-15,EBAY,0.05513947084546089,0.9155921936035156,0.029268326237797737
Ebay,What is the difference between State and Country?,"Sorry if the question sounds dumb, I'm new to eBay.

When asked to give the address, it requires a State and a Country. In my native language there is no difference between the two, so I'm kinda confused.

For example, if I'm from Italy, do i input ""Italy"" as both the State and the Country?",4,5,2015-12-15,EBAY,0.06386025249958038,0.895249605178833,0.040890101343393326
Ebay,Question about global shipping program &amp; training an employee to ship that way,"I am scared of things that eBay does, so I've been nervous to use their GSP for this long.  But I'm a bit tired of paying for lost international packages, so...

I have a very specific question.  I run my ebay business remotely from Thailand, with a lister employee and a shipper employee, so I will have to train her from here.  How complicated will it be to migrate to GSP?  What are the shipping steps involved?  We ship jewelry in padded envelopes, and the jewelry is individually wrapped (and quite well -- none broken in a long time).  How about printing the labels and stuff?  How does that go?

Ebay,buying an iphone on ebay(.uk I suppose),"hey redditers,

I recently aknowledged that a friend of mine and his brother bought each one an iphone 5 at eBay (the .uk one I think since it was shipped from the UK because I live in Portugal and shipping it outside of the U.E. will get it stuck due to customs).

One of them was bought on auction by 80€ and the other by 'buy it now' for 100€. 

If anyone here have already bought an iphone or any other smartphone on ebay, I have those 2 questions:

1 - How can I know if it's a real iphone or a replica?

2 - How do I know if it's blocked to any telecompany and if not, isn't there a change that it won't work in other countries?

I'm totally new to this and I'm thinking about getting an iphone there to give my mother as xmas gift.

Ebay,Strange problem on selling multiple items to the same buyer,"A buyer just won 7 of my auctions for magazines.  When I try to send him an invoice, it only shows 6 of the items (even if I click Send  Invoice on the item that is missing on the list).

Ebay,Desperately need advice on a phone I sold!,"I recently posted to here asking about shipping to GSP centres which thankfully was resolved and the item that I sold, an iPhone 5s, reached the buyer. However after a few days I got a message from the buyer saying that the phone wasn't working as intended, stating that the screen had white marks appearing from the edges and also that the home button on the phone wasn't working either. Obviously I was worried about this as I rarely sell items on eBay and when I sent my iPhone I double boxed it in perfect working condition, I know as I was only using it a week prior to getting my new phone.

Anyway because I read that in cases where the seller states the item is broken I decided to reluctantly ask her to return it to me and I would issue a refund as I could see no other way of resolving the situation, I should also mention she sent some photos of the phone which were darkly lit and not very good photos overall, I couldn't even tell if it was my iPhone or her old iPhone which had broken and she was trying to get money out of me for it.

So after confirming that she could return the phone to me I received a message today saying that she could only ship it through FedEx as the other shipping options wouldn't allow her to ship a phone with a battery in? Which I also found strange because I was able to ship the phone to her without any hassle, the message also stated that I would have to pay for the return shipping cost and that it would cost **77 euros**! I immediately messaged her back and stated that I would not be paying that amount for return shipping for a phone that was in perfect working condition when I sent it, which has now supposedly broken in her hands!

I am obviously very upset at this entire situation and being someone who rarely sells on eBay I am unsure what to do, her profile has good feedback but I can't help but feel I am involved in some sort of scam... Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Ebay,eBay needs stricter controls on neutral/negative feedback for new buyers.,"Not looking for help here, just looking to rant, hoping other sellers feel the same way.


I sold an item in perfect working condition, the buyer had 2 feedback, and I figured everything would work out fine. Item was only sold for $20.




Today I receive a complete garbled message from the buyer, saying the item works, but not in a certain way. (Issue is most likely buyer's fault/equipment)

I fear the worst, and check my feedback page, and sure enough, they left a negative feedback saying ""I bought the (item) for $20 and it doesnt do x""


I never had a chance to help the buyer, they just left the negative, and didn't even start a return request. Buyer also waited almost 4 weeks to leave the feedback, and send garbled message.

I can't say how mad I am that buyers can just do a drive-by if you will, and leave us seller's with our reputation tarnished. 



imho I feel that eBay should not allow new buyers with less than x feedback to leave neutral/negative.

I previously worked at both Apple and Oakley, and when I made these purchases I sent the receipts to my work emails.

The sunglasses were purchased over 8 years ago! How in the heck am I supposed to provide a receipt? Well, Ebay's answer is for me to go to my previous employer and have them dig up those receipts for me. Otherwise my SS number and fact I've been an Ebay user for a decade isn't enough.

He messages me (10 days after recieving): ""Did not fit my Macbook Pro Late 2008 Model. The bottom piece does not fit into the LCD Cover flush.. The cover that was included is not for an Macbook Pro Late 2008 Model. LCD also appears to have a damaged inverter for the back-light. Requesting full refund.""

I had included the cover to protect it a little better in shipping, it had a few scratches, so really had little or no value. 

I messaged him and told him I won't accept the return; I'm calling eBay to see if I can get it closed.

Edit: So, eBay says it's a case of ""buyer's remorse"" and I have to take the return. 

Update: I called back and spoke to another Rep. Explained that it couldn't be returned in the original condition as there had been an install attempt and the 2008 model isn't even close to fitting in the 2009/2010 model. She escalated the case and closed it in my favor.

Ebay,"First-time seller, is this buyer legit?","I just put my Galaxy S6 up on eBay last night and it sold in about an hour, which I was surprised at because it was priced on the higher end of the market. I got an email from eBay saying that it had sold and there was this message attached from the buyer:

&gt; Hello, Just bought your item. I will like to make immediate payment for the item but i need this further information. 1.Please send me your PayPal email i.d or send me a money request to my email ID: *generic-email*@yahoo.com 2.Picture of the item. 3.Also provide me your EBAY USER ID and item number just to be sure am making payment to the right person. Regards

The name on the account does not match the name on the address I received. Also, the address he/she sent me shortens the street address by leaving out vowels, but I figured out what it was supposed to be and it was for a retirement home in North Carolina. Are these red flags that I should worry about? Thanks!

Edit: also, the buyer's account is over 10 years old and has 19 reputation (?) but no positive feedback in the last month. I messaged them through Ebay saying the address was incomplete and that they must give me a complete one if they want to continue, I'll see what they say back.",11,8,2015-12-18,EBAY,0.03453442081809044,0.9290526509284973,0.036412857472896576

Ebay,Seller shipped me wrong item but is hostile + accusing me of swap scamming,"Made a lowball Best Offer on a piece of rather common music equipment. To my delight, the seller accepted! (We're talking $49 total here)

  Unfortunately the wrong item showed up. A different type of music gear, easily confused for the other by a layman. It's nice, it is just not what I need for my project.

I opened a seller-shipped-wrong-item dispute and the seller is SUPER hostile and accusing me of making this all up and trying to return somebody else's mixer to her for a refund. Which is ridiculous, as the item she sent me has the same value as the other one! She'd only be out shipping! It's just not the exact right device I need.

Now, I'm seeing some scary stories about how this goes for some buyers, and I am now a little freaked out because i did the ""Ask ebay to step in"" escalation and get a big red YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM THIS ACTION error. Which, given that the seller sent me a bunch of unsolicited messages four days after my initial exchange with them, leads me to think that they're abusing deadline extensions by waiting until the last minute to respond to me - I had somebody try to do this on Paypal on me this summer (full refund there). Just rambling accusations and comments as to how 'they use a different size of bubble wrap'.

  To be quite honest, I don't have the time or inclination to sit on the phone for hours arguing with eBay about this shit, and if eBay has a system that can be abused by sellers like this, I'll just do a CC chargeback and close my eBay account. I don't need to shop there that badly. However, I'd like to resolve this on eBay if it is indeed possible.  What are my next steps here?


E: Closed in my favor. Called ebay, explained, no question about it, got a prepaid label.

A few hours later he relisted the same hats (it was 1 of 10,) for a higher price.

It was only a few bucks and not really a big deal, but it bothers me that the seller didn't bother to at least shoot me a quick message as to why he felt the need to cancel the order. It just seems kinda shady.

Ebay,Am I getting scammed by this buyer?,"The listing doesn't accept any returns before we get started! The package was also insured for the full eBay value!

Buyer agreed, purchased a turbocharger, I refunded half the cost (like 5 bucks.)

Ebay,So this happened...,"I put up a BOSE mobile headset. I listed it as a buy now and best offer. This guy sent his first offer. I countered it. He sent the same offer. I countered it with 10 dollars more than his offer. He agrees. He waits for a invoice, so I send it. He pays via PayPal.

I send the packaged item on Friday. It gets there Saturday. Problem. The mailman couldn't get a signature and couldn't leave the package because there was no secure location for the said package. So the mailman left a notice to pick up at post office.

What can I do if this turns into a ""I DIDN'T RECEIVE MY ITEM"" or a ""ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED"" case? I have the receipt for the shipping of the item. It had tracking and sig confirmation (Plus limited $50 insurance). The item was unopened and new but the package/box it came in was a bit banged up. I put that in the description and even took pictures showing the condition of the package/box the item is in. I marked the item as ""New Other"".

Ebay,"Mom bought a ""Chromecast"" on Ebay.",Last Christmas I bought my parents a Chromecast. They liked it so much my mom decided to buy one for my grandpa this year. I helped her buy my niece a gift card off EBay back in October and she was happy with the deal she got. So she goes onto Ebay (without my help this time) and orders a Chromecast. She is pretty proud of herself because she saved about $7 and got free shipping. A day or two after she ordered the Chromecast she shows me the item. It was not a Chromecast. It was an Easy Cast. In the title the item was listed as an Easy Cast Chrome Cast (whatever that means). It looks almost exactly like a Chromecast and even says Chromecast in the title. To make it even worse the item was being delivered from China so it would take another week to even open a case. The seller offered us $5 and told us we could keep the item. I asked eBay to step in and the seller refunded her the full amount and we didn't have to send the easy cast back. I'm glad I was able to get my mom a full refund. Keep an eye on what your buying (keep an eye on what your inexperienced parents are buying). I'm sure this has happened to other people too.

It takes 2-4 weeks for delivery, but **today**, as I was tracking the order, it showed me that it was on Alert, returning to sender! as of 22/12/2015. I was shocked, so I talked to the sorting center or post office that received the item (Dubai sorting Center - Emirates Post), and they told me that since you don't have a post office or mail registered for your home or something like that, they will send it back (the shipping method was through post offices). I usually receive items through a courier, so I never knew that it needed a post office or mail. I have never purchased an item from another country or even used eBay and Amazon  before so I never knew about something like that.

Ebay,"Sold a phone, buyer claims it no longer works.","I am a casual eBay user - a consumer mostly.  So I sold a phone the other day on eBay.  It was in working condition and not a scratch on it.  

A few days after the buyer gets it they email me saying the sim card is recognized by the phone, but they can't make calls.  I offer some basic troubleshooting tips, like rebooting, calling their carrier to register the sim etc.

A few days go by and I get an email saying the buyer wants a refund because the item was not as described i.e. they cant make it work.  In the request they do not indicate that they tried any of these troubleshooting steps.

Just to be perfectly clear, the phone I sent was packaged very well and was perfectly functional.  I have no way of knowing if they damaged it, or are swapping it or what is going on.  All I know is that I listed the item honestly.

So, the more I think about this the more it upsets me.  I listed the phone as working, because it was.  And just because the buyer cant get their SIM card to work ( allegedly ) I now have to accept a return? On an item listed as ""Returns not accepted""?!

I have a feeling I'm getting screwed out of a few hundred dollars here.  Might not be the end of the world, but it sure makes me not want to sell on eBay anymore.

Oh, I am further suspicious because this buyer left a review for someone else complaining about receiving another electronic gadget they claim did not work.

Ebay,[Update] Ordered item off eBay. Item never came and seller never replied to my messages. Open case and requested refund...,"I just wanted to give everyone an update from my [last submission](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3x84lt/ordered_item_off_ebay_item_never_came_and_seller/).
So after an eBay seller repeatedly ignored my questions, failed to follow-up with what he said he would do as per our phone conversation, and never gave me a status update about the shipping of an item I bought from him, I opened a case because I didn't receive the item and requested a full refund. I won the eBay case and a full refund was issued to me.

Next, the item arrived in the mail and I needed to send the item to the seller, but wondered to myself who should pay for the shipping and *why*. (In the last thread, nobody ever really explained me *why* in an objective, logical manner.) Some of the jaded eBay sellers in the last thread had it in for me and made all kinds of assumptions. I was told things like:

[""To me, it's clearly a case of buyers remorse.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3x84lt/ordered_item_off_ebay_item_never_came_and_seller/cy3dp2i)

[""Holding a small-time seller accountable for USPS delivery times during the holiday season, then slamming them with a 2-way postage bill, is pretty dick-ish, I must say.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3x84lt/ordered_item_off_ebay_item_never_came_and_seller/cy2u2jt)

How does this person even know this seller is some ""small-time seller""? I think it's pretty inconsiderate when an eBay seller repeatedly ignores their buyer's questions.

[""Please remember sellers can't control what the post office does. ... My point: consider cutting sellers a bit of a break. Or pay for guaranteed next day delivery if you must have something it urgently""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3x84lt/ordered_item_off_ebay_item_never_came_and_seller/cy48c12)

[""I respond within 2 days, which is very reasonable. I don't respond on weekends...because screw off, I'm busy.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3x81tw/ordered_item_off_ebay_item_never_came_and_seller/cy4c8to)

Some people in the last thread assumed I was upset that the item arrived late and proclaimed this was the post office's fault. (I was out of town when the item was originally scheduled to arrive and this isn’t a time sensitive item for me.) I understand that items sometimes arrive later than normal during the busy holiday season, I'm not refuting this. Repeating that items sometimes arrive later than normal during the busy holiday season doesn’t add anything to the discussion.

The underlying problem was that **I got no response from the seller** about a status update regarding the shipping of an item I bought from him. Some of the comments in the last thread basically used the post office as a scapegoat for the seller's poor communication. Again, **the seller repeatedly ignored my questions** and abandoned me after he received my payment.
This past Friday I sent the seller a message informing him that if he wanted me to send the item to him, he would be responsible for the shipping.

After the seller ignored all of my previous messages, **the seller responds to me *the next day*** on a *Saturday* with a prepaid shipping label.

Let that sink in.

When I just asked for status updates regarding the shipment of the item I purchased, I was repeatedly ignored by the seller. The item arriving late is irrelevant. **The chaos and confusion that goes on the post office should not have justified this seller's lack of communication.** For those of you that think eBay seller’s shouldn’t have to follow [eBay’s selling practices]( http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-practices.html) and be bothered with having to respond to their entitled buyer’s questions promptly, then that’s not my problem so take it up with eBay or use another service.

When I sent the seller a message informing him that he needs to pay for shipping if he wants me to send the item to him, he responds to me **the next day**. (I just don't see how some of you sympathize with this seller.) That's not somebody I want do business with as his customer service is nonexistent. (And please don't respond with the, ""Of course he's going to respond to you because you have your full refund and the item!"" **The seller could have used that same hustle to respond to me initially and the whole outcome would have been different. The seller would have made his sale and not have to pay for shipping.**)
Furthermore, I responded to the seller about a minor issue with the shipping label and he responded to this message **the next day**. The seller even sent me a follow-up message to make sure the prepaid shipping label was alright. (Where was this type communication before?)

In the end, I printed out the seller's provided prepaid shipping label and taped it onto the unopened package over the old shipping label. Next, I drove to the post office and had it sent if off. Finally, I sent the seller a message letting him know I had taken the item to the post office.

The end.

**Tl;dr:** Ordered item off eBay. I waited and waited and saw that the shipping status was unchanged. Tried to communicate with seller to get a status update on the shipping. Seller repeatedly ignored me. Item still never came in the mail. Opened a case and requested a full refund for item not received. A refund was issued to me. The item came in the mail. Sent the seller a message informing him he would be responsible for the shipping. The seller magically responds to me the **next day** with a shipping label. I took the item to the post office to be shipped to the seller.",7,4,2015-12-23,EBAY,0.0877839382737875,0.8485647737979889,0.06365125440061092
Ebay,Still getting used to GSP...,"Ok I added GSP to all my listings a few days ago, but I thought it would automatically override my other shipping options.  

1.  Example 1: Item 221975512848 shows my old prices for international shipping; GSP is checked.  I never removed my old intentional shipping services/prices, but oddly after enabling GSP, it no longer will let me set a price (but seems to remember the old price.) but it does still have the services / countries.  When I select a foreign country to ship to on the listing page, it has no mention of GSP.

2.  Example 2: Item 221974353480 I removed all my international shipping details and left the GSP checked.  It seems to show correctly now.

3.  Do I need to go through and delete all my other listings' int shipping options in order to use GSP?

Ebay,I need advice on my experience with a scammer (or scammers),"So I put a relatively high-value item up for sale (just over $1000). Within an hour of the posting, someone's claimed (but not payed for) the item. Ok, maybe they'll finish the transaction soon. After 10 minutes I get a message on ebay from the buyer asking for my email address. Before I can respond, they do an ""information request"", which sends both buyer and seller both their personal information. So the buyer gets my name and phone number but not my email address. I didn't know this was possible for buyers and I'm not happy with ebay about it, because shortly after I get an SMS, in broken english, from an anonymous web-based messaging service asking for my paypal email address. Ok, I'm not stupid. I do some googling, and this is a well-known scam. They subvert ebay, send me the payment directly through paypal, then do a charge-back or dispute the transaction or whatever after I send the package. So I report the buyer to ebay, ebay nukes the whole transaction and the buyer's account, and I relist the item. Great.

The first buyer continues messaging me asking for my paypal email address through SMS, and I just ignore him. One week later, someone (maybe the same person) with a different account buys the item from the new listing, completes the transaction through paypal and immediately messages me saying they need to give me a different address. I check my paypal account, they've paid, so I ask them what address they'd like me to send the item to. Then I get an email from paypal indicating that they're ""investigating a payment reversal"" because the ""payment you received may have been made without the account holder's consent or in error"". I soon get another email from paypal that the reversal was denied to the buyer and that they haven't taken the money back. I check, and the money's still in my paypal account.

Probably not the best idea, but I already started the transfer they money from paypal to my bank account (paypal says it'll take 4 days to clear), and I still haven't received a response from the buyer with the correct address (it's been 2 days). I think I've found the worst scammer ever. What happens if they never give me the correct address? Should I mail it to the original address? Should I just not mail it, and keep the money? That seems unethical (and maybe illegal?), but they're scammers (so I don't feel bad), but maybe it's not the scammers' money. How would I even declare that as income on my taxes?

Ebay,Question regarding damaged product,"Hello,

I sold a MacBook Air for $500 on eBay which was water damaged. I outlined all the deficiencies that occur as a result of it that has happened in the past three or so months since that occurred, which was on occasion the laptop would freeze and you would have to restart it. I made it very clear in the advertisement that these were the current problems as a result although it is completely operational at the time of sale, as was shown before giving him the laptop in person.

Quite naturally I feel bad and thought I should give him the money back. But he pretty much broke the computer somehow downloading something I  am assuming because some completely brand new issue has started. Like I said it isn't my responsibility if the product gets worse after the time of sale as I could not foresee it occurring. I would normally give him the money back but I think he's done something to break it.

What should I do? I did everything right as far as I know and this guy was either unlucky or did something weird. I feel pretty bad but I would feel worse having a laptop returned completely broken when it was fully operational when I sold it earlier today after daily use for the last 3 months when the issue occured.",10,6,2015-12-24,EBAY,0.4181492030620575,0.5459970235824585,0.03585374355316162

Ebay,eBay keep sending non-relevant canned answers,"I'm an eBayer for 9 years now, I got terrible customer support in 2 different cases, I lost $185 in total... I'd like to share one of these cases and would love to get your opinion - 

I ordered an ""Original"" Lenovo battery from a Chinese seller. When it arrive it didn't resemble the picture in the item page so I opened a ""Item Not As Described"" dispute. Long story short, the seller needs to pay the [return shipping cost](http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/return-item.html#shipping-charges) in this case. I asked the seller for a return shipping label and he responded as follows: **""We're sorry. We have not a shipping label. When we receive it, we will pay for your shipping cost via PayPal. Best regards,""**

I sent the battery back and after a while I got a confirmation that the seller signed and accepted the package, it cost me $25 to send the battery back, I uploaded the receipt to the return page and was asking the seller / eBay to pay it back. The seller ignored me. I turned to eBay customer care about it and they said to me that I should've been waiting for the return label and that they can't cover this expense. I asked them to step in and help and ask the seller to keep up to his word but they **didn't even try**. Their response was: Needless to say, this is very disappointing.

In the return page, and in their [policy](http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/return-item.html#shipping-charges), eBay clearly present sending the item back yourself as a viable option.

Ebay,eBay nor refund on Digital Items,"Translation (thank you @Jaynepatience):

This is very frustrating. A salesman ripped me simply. At this eBay he ruled in his favor and even removed the negative comment I had left him, perhaps because of my difficulty with English, or perhaps because eBay says not offer the eBay Protection program for digital items. I find it discriminatory that eBay does not have telephone service in Spanish. I bought my iPhone 4S unlocking Sprint to use with other GSM company outside the US. I chose this seller because he spoke Spanish, but also because others offered breakouts for Sprint iPhone 4S price three times higher. I should have known it was a scam, but I did not. The ad said that 24 to 48 hours would already be unlocked. It did not, but I was patient. 84 hours later I received an email from the seller sending an unlock code called MSL, which only serves to activate the CDMA mobile technology. I complained that this was not what I had paid, that is not how the GSM iPhone breakouts for work, but ignored all my messages. After my complaint, the vendor released the description of his announcement and said this: ""iPhone 5 and lower MSL will get no itunes sim unlock code will still be invalid untill you give the code to new carrier not take it all carriers."" In my first claim, eBay failed in my favor, but to refund my money should I return the item, it seems the seller is very skillful and provided them with traking number of a shipment that had me (do not know how, if digital) article. And since I obviously could not return the item as it is digital and seller never sent me anything, eBay now ruled in his favor and sent me this message: ""eBay Customer Support has made a final decision Unfortunately, this item is not eligible. . Money Back Guarantee eBay for Final decision: A refund will not be issued for esta case "". In the same article, the seller already has 5 negative feedbacks of users who have had the same problem as me. eBay after ruling in his favor erased the negative feedback I had left. I think the seller knows how cheat and emerge unscathed. He says in their ads: "". I will send this item by mail postcard Sending this item by email or by any other digital delivery method is not allowed and Violates eBay policy"", but actually does not. Not physically send the item because it does not make sense to do so, but instead is protected because eBay can not force him to make the money back while the buyer does not return the item.


Original:

Esto es muy frustante. Un vendedor me ha estafado de forma simple. Ante esto eBay falló a su favor e incluso removió el comentario negativo que le había dejado, quizá por mi dificultad con el inglés, o quizá porque eBay asegura que no ofrecen el programa eBay Protection para artículos digitales.
Me resulta discriminatorio que eBay no cuente con atención telefónica en español.
Compré el desbloqueo de mi iPhone 4S de Sprint para poder usarlo con otra compañía GSM fuera de EEUU. Elegí este vendedor porque hablaba español, pero también porque los demás ofrecían los desbloqueos para iPhone 4S de Sprint a precio tres veces más alto. Debí sospechar se trataba de una estafa, pero no lo hice.
El anuncio decía que de 24 a 48 horas ya estaría desbloqueado. No fue así, pero fui paciente. 84 horas después recibí un correo del vendedor enviándome un código de desbloqueo llamado MSL, que sólo sirve para activar el móvil en la tecnología CDMA. Le reclamé que eso no era por lo que había pagado, que no es así como funcionan los desbloqueos GSM para el iPhone, pero ignoró todos mis mensajes.
Luego de mi reclamación, el vendedor editó la descripción de su anuncio y agregó esto: ""iPhone 5 and lower will get a Msl unlock code no itunes sim will still be invalid untill you give the code to new carrier not all carriers take it"".
En mi primera reclamación, eBay falló a mi favor, pero que para devolverme el dinero debía yo devolver el artículo, según parece el vendedor es muy hábil y les facilitó un traking number de un envío que me había hecho (no sé cómo, si es un artículo digital). Y como yo lógicamente no pude devolver el artículo pues es digital y el vendedor nunca me envío nada, eBay ahora falló a su favor y me envió este mensaje:
""eBay Customer Support has made a final decision. Unfortunately, this item isn't eligible for eBay Money Back Guarantee. Final decision: A refund won't be issued for this case"".
En el mismo artículo, el vendedor ya lleva 5 feedbacks negativos de usuarios que han tenido el mismo problema que yo. eBay, luego de fallar a su favor borró el feedback negativo que había dejado.
Creo este vendedor sabe bien cómo estafar y salir ileso. Dice en sus anuncios: ""I will send this item by postal mail. Sending this item by email or by any other digital delivery method is not allowed and violates eBay policy"", pero en realidad no lo hace. No envía el artículo físicamente pues no tendría sentido hacerlo, pero en cambio queda protegido pues eBay no puede obligarlo a hacer el reembolso del dinero mientras el comprador no devuelva el artículo.",19,1,2015-12-26,EBAY,0.05625303275883198,0.903815507888794,0.039931461215019226

Ebay,"Frustrated with eBay search, sellers gaming the system","This issue isn't really caused by eBay, but by sellers (and, eBay's policies that allow it) 

The issue (which can really be for any product) is the way sellers combine product listings and set prices. I'm looking for a two wheel self balancing scooter. I search for ""self balancing scooter"". I use the refine option to set buy it now listings, new only, and sort price from low to high. I also set the minimum price to $100, to filter out all/most of the junk/accessories/etc. 

The problem is sellers combine listings with the hoverboards (around $250, more or less) and accessories, which they list at lower prices so their listing shows up near the top in my search. For example, all the hoverboard listings sell the carrying bag only. The bag is probably worth about $20 realistically, at the most. 

But sellers list bags only for $100, $110, $120, $130, $140, 175.99, etc, and combine it with their listings for the scooters.  so they are always at the very top of the search results when people search for a product and set a minimum price, even though the actual scooters in those listings are significantly more expensive. It makes it very difficult to find the minimum price for an ACTUAL self balancing scooter. 

Of course, this goes for any product, really. I wish eBay would do something about it.",2,1,2015-12-28,EBAY,0.04923795536160469,0.9196361303329468,0.031125962734222412

Ebay,Lost package responsibility?,"Hey everyone, 

I had a recent issue on ebay as a buyer... here goes..

**Backstory**


I bought a 300 dollar item.  it was shipped priority insured.  A signature was required.  


The USPS attempted to deliver the item while I was getting married a few states away (Dec 17th), so I promptly scheduled a re-delivery for a date when I would be in town after my honeymoon (Dec 26th).  

Well, I was home all day on the 26th and nothing ever came, so I checked tracking.  The USPS says that the item was delivered and signed for by **MY NAME** on the 24th.  I was in Florida, and have travel documents and receipts to prove it..

The seller is saying tough luck, but let me know if you need anything, so I have filed a postal fraud case with the USPS Inspector general and a help case with 800-ask-usps (they have not returned my call 72 hours later).  


**Question**


Who is responsible for handling this, the buyer(me) or the seller?   Isn't it best practice for the vendor to just file the USPS case and refund me or replace the item?  I feel like I am sitting over here doing all the leg work to either find the package or get it insured while he/she does nothing.  

What is the ethical course of action here, what would you do?

**Edit:**  the seller has just informed me that the insurance he purchased was only 100 when the item was 320... and that i will only get 100 from insurance and he will not make me whole, so there's that...",15,2,2015-12-29,EBAY,0.036802031099796295,0.9309937357902527,0.032204244285821915
Ebay,Multiple listings - single vs lots,"I feel like this is definitely against eBay policy but I just wanted to double check. For example if I'm selling widget A at $20 can I create another listing for 3 of widget A at $50? Also, if I'm selling a widget that has five different varieties instead of lumping them all in one listing can I have them separate?


Each of these tactics are used by my competitor to flood the search results page. So 9/10 results will be their widgets in different varieties and quantities with my single listing falling somewhere in-between.


If I keep the compiled listing for individual widgets I lose out of the increased margins for lots and the increased exposure. If I forgo the individual listings and only offer lot pricing I will lose out on the best match/lowest price options. Could I possibly use one listing for singles with variations and one listing for lots with variations?",4,1,2015-12-29,EBAY,0.05988983064889908,0.8983399868011475,0.04177015274763107

Ebay,Why might a seller end multiple listings of similar items within a few hours of each other?,"I'm a music enthusiast who often buys photos, records, and t-shirts of various artists from eBay. A few days ago, I came across a photo negative I wanted to buy, but I decided not to do so right away because I didn't have much money at my disposal and thought I could discover other items I had an equal or greater interest in purchasing. Today, though, when I finally elected to buy the photo negative, I saw the following message on the listing: ""This listing was ended by the seller because the item is no longer available."" The auction was said to end this Wednesday, so I reasoned that there was likely something wrong with the negative and that's why the seller removed it from his shop. Quickly, I started looking for similar ones in the guy's store and saw that he was selling 22 other photo negatives of the same artist. ""Good,"" I thought, ""I'll check back later in the day and comb through them more vigorously to find one I'd like to buy.""

Except after a few hours, when I did just that, all the photo negatives of the artist were gone. Further research showed that every single listing was branded with the aforementioned message. Interestingly enough, though, there were still a few printed photos of the artist, and hundreds of other photo negatives of different artists, suggesting that there wasn't anything wrong with selling pictures of the artist or negatives of any artist on eBay. Also, dunno if this helps, but the seller had a really high (in the thousands) and perfect feedback score - why he'd do something that could potentially damage it is confusing. What might be a reason for his having pulled 23 photo negatives of the artist within hours of each other?

Ebay,Need a little help with weird buyer,"Hi everyone

I was selling my gaming PC when a guy offered me well below my asking price, due to the need for the sale I took it. The guy seems okay but a bit weird. He text me telling when I had to be home as he has paid and wants to pick it up same day. I changed my plans to help this guy out as afterall he had just paid.

Currently the payment is in ""Pending"" as I have never used ebay before. I sold the computer as it as and I just got an email telling me that he hasn’t got some of the screws on the inside and when am I going to send them to him, surely as I sold with no boxes or added things I shouldn’t be responsible. He brought the PC and mains plug…
He then went on to say that the copy of windows is non legit, now I installed this fresh a few days ago and am 100% sure its legit as used a old copy of windows xp and then updated to windows 10. 
Now he is saying he would like to return the item based on the previous comments even though the ad says no refunds?
What should I do as my money is in pending and I don’t want to have no money AND no computer.

Ebay,"Question: How do you avoid deadbeat buyers, and what, if anything, will eBay do about this?","Edit: Ignore the dramatic title ending. I realize eBay will probably do nothing since this isn't a new problem. 

Genuinely curious about how everyone handles bidders/buyers who win the auction, but never pay or claim that they never bid on the item themselves. 

I've been buying and selling on eBay since 1999. In general, my experiences have been positive and smooth. However, in the last *year or so,* I've had the pleasure of 8-10 BIN and Auction-style sales where the highest bidder/purchaser has not paid for the item. In two separate situations, the purchasers BOTH claimed that they were not ""the individual"" who purchased the item on their account, and I was SOL. 

What I've learned to do with BIN auctions (regrettably, late to the game!) is to request immediate payment to close the sale. But for auctions, this isn't possible. 

Any advice or pointers from long-time eBayers out there? I feel like anyone can ignore an auction they regret bidding on and/or claim it wasn't them who bid on it, and it feels like the consequences of doing so on the BIDDING side are slim to none.

Ebay,Seller isn't refunding money despite receiving item,"I bought a laptop off eBay for £115. I received it on the 9th of December. At this point I had changed my mind about the laptop because in hindsight it would not be suitable for my needs, instead I purchased another laptop from a different seller. I was not worried because the seller stated a 30 day return period with full refund. I notified the seller and initiated a return request on the 9th of December. At this point the package was unopened, so still in its original packaging and taped up. I explained this to the seller in the return request. However, the seller was not confirming the return request, nor was replying to any of my messages. Despite this because the seller promised a refund within the 30 day period, and the fact I believe I'm covered by law to return an item within a 14 day period, I just returned the item to the specified return address which was given to me in the return request. I used an alternative courier because Parcelforce does not cover laptops, so I used DX delivery which eBay does not track automatically. I was not worried about this because this delivery method was still tracked, signed for and insured. I gave her the tracking number and kept her in the loop the entire time. The laptop was delivered to her on the 18th of December and was signed for. Eventually the seller confirmed the return request on the 21st of December and eBay asked me to provide the shipping details, so I entered DX as the courier and provided the tracking number just for record even though it was delivered on the 18th. Because eBay does not automatically track this courier, the return request tracking still saying that it is ""In Transit"". I asked the seller the confirm whether or not the refund has been initiated, but she is saying she won't do it until eBay confirms via the tracking that the item has been received. She says it is hard to track individual items because of so many coming in and out, but the item was delivered to her and signed for on the 18th of December. I have told her that eBay will not automatically update this because it is an alternative courier, so I provided her with the tracking number and website to track it. She is again not replying.

Have I went about this the wrong way? I was led to believe I was protected via a return policy and also buyer protection. I delivered it to her before she confirmed the return request because she was not doing anything and I wanted it delivered to her before 14 days were up because I read that in the Consumer Rights Law. Because a return address was given to me I returned it anyway because it would be obvious what it was when she receives it. The tracking does specifically say it was delivered on the 18th and signed for. Why would she not say she has received it? My name and address was on the label as well. Will I get my money back?

Ebay,Re-seller wanted me to ship to multiple locations and I messed up.,"Hello everyone. I offer a promo at my ebay store that if you buy 4 or more of some items shipping is free. I have been using this for a few months now and a few times a week I get the occasional buyer who didn't read my listing and bought 4 items separately instead of adding them to the cart first to get the discount automatically taken out. I used to just cancel those transactions and have the buyer check out a second time, but recently have been taking a hit with the paypal fee to refund the buyers the cost of shipping to keep them happy for the holidays. 

Well with the holiday rush I have been getting many more people not doing the promo right so I am pretty much on autopilot when I see 4 separate listings for the same thing by the same buyer I refund the money and ship 4 items in one box. Yesterday a buyer bought 4 of my items separately so I refunded the shipping today and sent the buyer a message letting him know. I sent out his items and just now I got a message saying he had 4 different addresses.

Crap I have turned into the guy who doesn't read! He did have 4 different addresses, all different states. I guess this guy is a re seller and relists things that are already on ebay. He then has the seller forward his item to the winner. Never have I had the same seller with 4 different addresses for the same item. Has anyone else had to deal with these ""sellers""? 

My question is what do I do here exactly? It is my mistake. I refunded him for the shipping cost of the 4 items before my screw up. I then printed the shipping label for the first auction and copied the same tracking to all 4 listings. So some lady in California who ordered 1 is getting 4 and 3 other people are getting screwed, most likely. Should I give this guy more money back? I already refunded him 15% of what he paid for the shipping promo that he didn't want. 

What I might do is ask the seller to send me back the original refund and ship out the items to the 3 other sellers, but that just hurts for me to think about right now.",5,1,2015-12-30,EBAY,0.047503795474767685,0.9209160804748535,0.03158014267683029

Ebay,Refunds on my re-loadable visa green dot cardn to appearing on balance.,"Earlier this week I returned some shoes to a seller that he received today. I asked when he would process the refund, he did promptly. My question is that it appears on my Paypal account that my refund has been received on my visa green dot card, yet when I check my balance for it, it remains the same as if no activity has been processed into it. I'm kind of scared that I wont receive my refund. Any one have any ideas on how this works? Thanks a lot friends!",2,2,2015-12-31,EBAY,0.03648993745446205,0.864788293838501,0.09872178733348846
Ebay,Is it allowed to ask a seller to relist part of an unsold lot? (specifics inside),Somebody is selling four pokémon plushes as a lot for buy it now or best offer. Their listing expires in two days (I think it was set to 30 days). Would it be allowed to message the seller if it doesn't sell asking for them to relist just one of the plushes on its own? I know soliciting a sale of ebay items outside of ebay isn't allowed so I just wanted to make sure before going ahead.
