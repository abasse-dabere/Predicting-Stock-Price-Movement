Ebay,Great Experience on eBay,"I recently bought a computer, advertised as a 2017 model, on eBay. The computer came, with a number of issues:

- The RAM wasn't installed properly. I reinstalled it and it worked fine.

- The power supply and cord was missing. I have 2 extra cords.

- The DVD burner didn't work. I have an external blu-ray drive, so this is extraneous.

I related these to the seller ending with ""this is just FYI, I'm not seeking a refund, nor do I want to return the item"". In a couple of hours, I checked the ebay account again to buy my wife a gift, and the seller wrote back to me saying he was sorry and that he's refunded 79% of the final price, as 21% was VAT. I said this was completely unnecessary and he said it was too late to cancel the refund and to enjoy my new purchase.

Ebay,I'm sick of buyer abusing returns for clothing...,"I don't do many sales in clothing... let me get that out there first. Secondly, I list all of my items BIN with pictures clearly defining the measurements of each article of clothing. From chest and length on shirts to inseams, outseams, and leg widths on pants.

​

It is absolutely absurd that buyers claim an item doesn't fit, then immediately open return cases. This is when a) I don't accept returns (but eBay does!) and b) I've had multiple eBay reps through twitter (who of which are extremely helpful)/phone saying that buyers aren't allowed to open returns for clothing not fitting as they expected.

​

My problem with this involves the fact that eBay expects small sellers who don't do this for a living to eat shipping costs like we're shipping from China. Next, if they're not allowed to return items for clothes not fitting, how in the world are they allowed to actually initiate a return case for that reason! C'mon eBay! Get your shit together!

Ebay,Sick of buyers abusing returns for clothing... (Part 2!),"Hey guys, I was here last night discussing a buyer abusing a return for two shirts he purchased from me, which can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/9c0lur/im\_sick\_of\_buyer\_abusing\_returns\_for\_clothing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/9c0lur/im_sick_of_buyer_abusing_returns_for_clothing/)

Just an update for you guys. I called eBay to discuss how to decline the return, since a) he mentioned in the messages the clothes didn't fit (which qualify as buyer's remorse) and b) he opened the return as INAD. Upon calling eBay, they informed me that he was removed from eBay's Money Back Guarantee program due to misusing and abusing returns previously. Go figure! I offered to take the shirts back under the condition that he pays return shipping, and of course he's declining to do so and is adamant that I must pay return shipping.

Not to speculate, but... he originally messaged me before opening the return, sending pictures about how the chest measurement was 1 inch larger than what I measured and showed in my listing pics. I've been sitting here wondering how this is possible, because both of our pictures show a pit to pit, seam to seam measurement with the shirt laid down flat. After opening up both pictures and comparing them side by side, it is clear to me that his tape measure uses a smaller inch than mine. I'm gonna try to put some pics in here as an edit for you.

In conclusion, he really thinks he's gonna walk away from this unscathed. I will be reporting his account, and hopefully my report triggers a suspension against him.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: The fact that some of you are actually agreeing with someone who has been removed from eBay's money back guarantee program for abusing returns in this very way is upsetting. I can and do appreciate people's opinions, positive or negative, however.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 3: I've literally had multiple eBay reps tell me I'm in the right here, but since some of you appear to know more than eBay, I'll gladly hear you out. Reminder: eBay is on my (the seller's) side in an INAD case, which is rare.

Ebay,Rules about warrantys,"Hello!

​

So I bought some headphones back in May and the seller page stated that the items have a 30 day refund period and a 6 month warranty. About 28 days in I needed a replacement set of headphone cables which was supplied. Now one of the headphones doesn't work, at all whatsoever.

​

I've contacted the seller to find out how to go about activating the warranty and such. My question is should the seller not honor the warranty, could I take it up with eBay? I recognize that only the manufacturing company for the headphones can issue a valid warranty but I was under the assumption that any and all item descriptions would be part of the legal contract of sale. So if you say there is a warranty and there isn't that would put you in bad water?

I don't use eBay that much so I feel like I've done a big no no and am going to suffer for it. Just want to know if I have a case or not.

Ebay,Can something be done about listing spam?,"If you're an eBay browser like me, you'll be familiar with spam listings. These are dozens of near-identical seller listings that differ only by a few random letters in the title.

After scrolling through page after page of useless, near-identical ads for the same product from the same seller, I'm sick of it. Listing spam turns eBay buying into an unpleasant experience, and may well be driving buyers away.

The spam is only going to get worse until something is done - and that is to ban offenders. In addition to banning their eBay accounts, eBay should also ban the names, emails, phone numbers and any other identifiable characteristics of spammers. If they can't operate freely, spammers will change their behaviour.

It's time for eBay to act on this. It's easy for humans to detect spam listings, and it would be trivial for eBay to provide a reporting method. Crowd-sourcing the detection of bad players offers an effective way to single out spammers.

But will this affect my account in any other way? The implication seems to be I lied about the condition or sabotaged the bag for a refund, but I was never asked about it. I have photos to prove otherwise if necessary.

I'm worried if this will affect any future transactions or not. Most returns I've made are open/shut cases for obvious reasons, but this one is a bit too close to ""she says, he says"" for me.

Edit: The exact text was: ""After reviewing your case, it appears that the item was returned in a different condition from how it was shipped.""

Edit: Got an email this morning from ebay requesting additional information. I called in and they said the seller is appealing the decision, but the refund has been issued. She said it looks like the seller needs to fill out an affidavit. They're outside of the US, does this complicate things?",6,4,2018-09-04,EBAY,0.040739599615335464,0.9243443608283997,0.034916091710329056

I recently got my TRS and Powerseller status. I mainly sell low $ items at high volume. I've been looking at my final value fees and it doesnt seem like the 10% has been applying? Or is it because I don't ship with tracking?

Ebay,New partial refund option on returns for sellers - has anyone been using?,"As a seller of brand new, expensive items (iPhones, iPads, etc), the new return policy which allows us to issue a partial refund is almost too good to be true.  I'm curious as to whether anyone else has had any experience using this and/or have ran into any problems, because I just can't see how eBay can sustain this (as long as we don't abuse it, which is what I'm afraid many sellers will do).

Or maybe I am just not used to having the advantages that eBay buyers have always had?

In case anyone is not familiar, I believe it was late July or early August that this went into effect.  eBay eliminated the restock fee option (which buyers could get around easily anyway by choosing ""item not as described"" or some other reason that would have been the seller's fault) and provided sellers with the ability to issue a partial refund, no matter what the buyer chooses as the return option.  The only stipulation was that 30 day, ""free"" returns had to be offered.  It doesn't make a lot of sense, because the return is showing to the buyer as ""free"" but we are then allowed to issue a partial refund.  If the buyer complains, eBay covers the cost and refunds the buyer the partial amount that was not refunded by the seller.  It also eliminates and negative feedback or defect from the transaction.

So in my case, I sell mostly iPhones, as stated before. None of these are defective (since they are new) but people will buy them, use them, and a lot of times return them by either making up a reason or just because they didn't like it (after using for nearly a month).  In the past this would leave me with a huge loss on the value of the item (around $150-$200 difference from a new iPhone to a used one), not to mention shipping, insurance, etc both ways on the return.  But now I can issue the partial credit, have eBay issue the rest, and I'm good to go for the resale.

So has anyone else been using this?  Like I said before, I'm afraid eBay is going to realize how much this will cost them and this is going to be changed very quickly.  And this is all for legitimate partial refunds... I'm sure there are sellers out there who are dishonest and issuing 50% partial refunds every time, leaving eBay to foot even more of the bill.",21,6,2018-09-05,EBAY,0.06641609966754913,0.9015284776687622,0.03205545246601105

i have 100 Free a day for the month, When i list on Mobile it's charging me. When i list on PC it isn't charging me. 

If i click on 'sell similar' no matter if I'm on PC or mobile it charges me. Also if i click 'Relist' It's also charging me. 

Another issue is When something is relisted automatically it's Charging me for some and not for others. I'm at the point now where i just take everything off and redo it myself so i don't get charged the fee as it's not taking it off my free listings per day. 

I'm not a Business seller as of yet as I've only been doing it just under 2 months, i've been given an extra 750 Items i'm able to list a month now which gives me 1k i think, i've not totalled much (around £1400) for the last 60 days but ebay only took £1.35 out of my Paypal as charges.. Anyone know whats going on? 

Also I've has quite a few unpaid items and for every one of those listings it's charged me to relist is that normal too?

Ebay,How can I increase my Conversion/Traffic (Trying to do $1000/mo)?,"Hi, I've recently started going all in with selling on ebay, and in the last two months, I've come near doing $1000/mo, but right now it feels like I lost all traction this month. Right now I have about 47 items (16 watchers for various items), and currently no bids on 7 of those items (the rest are fixed priced).  I'm wondering what are some tips to improve traffic to my listings. Here's what I've done so far:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Went back and took better clear and clean pictures of all my items.

\- Changed the price of my fixed items and included the shipping price in it, and added ""Free Shipping"" in title (e.g. a book I had listed for $4.99, I added the 2.66 to ship and made it $7.65 (free shipping)).

\- Deleted some old listings that have not worked, and added a few new ones.

\- I would say the average price of my items can vary. From $5 books, to $10 audiobooks, $100 electrical equipment and tools, and games around $20, so maybe average is $25.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some recent stats (I believe this is  Jul 12, 2018 - Aug 4, 2018):

Listing impressions 24,101

Click Through Rate 1.0%

Listing page views 669

Sales Conversion Rate 2.2%

&amp;#x200B;

Still no luck. In the last 30 days, my gross sales have been $701.98 (with one item actually going in the negative, I forgot I had free shipping checked when I converted it to auction).

They will list something being in (for example), London, or Essex. Now i end up purchasing something by purposely filtering my search results to ""Ships from UK only"". As i don't want to wait months for a tiny item to arrive in the mail from China. 

What is ebay's policy on this? If a seller states they are shipping an item from London, and yet it takes well over 3 weeks to arrive, and then turns up in a China air-mail stamped package, surely this is breaking ebay's policies in some way?

Having to wait so long for things to arrive, when i am expecting something to be shipped from a few towns away, expecting my item to arrive in less than a few days.

Ebay,Sold five items. Apparently I have a 80% shithead rate. Is this normal?,"Submitted first time with a typo, sorry for the repost.
First time posting on here, and if it sounds like I'm complaining, it's because I am.

I had some old electronics I wanted to get rid of, and so I decided to go the eBay route. I don't buy or sell very often so I only have about 50 feedback. I have a no returns policy due to having been burned in the past, and I also explicitly state that I 1) ship only to US addresses and 2) do not ship to freight forwarders.

Results of my five sales were as follows:

**1) Camera lens #1**: Buyer paid immediately, I shipped, no issues.

**2) Camera lens #2**: Buyer received the lens and immediately asked to return it because it doesn't fit his camera, also wanted me to pay for return shipping. I explicitly stated the lens mount in the title of the listing and in the description. I denied the request and said that it is not my responsibility to make sure that the lens fits his camera, only that the listing is correct.

**3) Motherboard**: I listed a motherboard and stated in the listing that I am only selling the board and the box. The buyer received it and is pissed that it isn't retail packaging with all the accessories (I never said it was in the listing). I pasted the listing in the message and he followed up with a refund request and, once again, wants me to pay for shipping. I told him he can return it in the same condition as he got it, but has to pay for shipping. He did not reply.

**4) Headphone amplifier**: Buyer gave me a freight forwarder address that does not match his PayPal address. I told him that I do not ship to freight forwarders. Then, he gave me an address in Canada which also was not a match. I cancelled the item using the ""problem with buyer's address"" option and relisted.

**5) Unopened vape kit**: Buyer didn't pay for two days, I sent an invoice to remind them. They reply saying that they don't have money to pay for it right now and that I have to wait a week or two. I opened an unpaid item case. Now the buyer wants me to cancel the transaction, which I cannot do and do not want to do anyway.

Ebay,Getting harassed by lowballing buyer?,"Hey all, 

I recently started selling on eBay part time (from Canada). I had a pair of shorts posted for $18 CAD+free shipping. A couple weeks ago I received an offer of $11 from a buyer. I countered with $14. The buyer countered back with $11 again. This sort of pissed me off so I just declined. A week later the same buyer offered $12.5. This time I countered with $16 to which the buyer countered $12.25. Obviously I declined this offer. This buyers offers made me rethink my price and made me realized that with free shipping I would not make any money as shipping as I’ve come to realize that shipping is crazy in Canada. I changed my BIN price to $28+shipping. Then, the same buyer sent me an offer of $1+shipping.  And now the buyer has begun to send me $1 offers on my other items too. 

Is it frowned upon to change the listing price? I feel like as a seller I have the right to change my listing price whenever I please and if the buyer doesn’t like that they should have accepted my (very reasonable) offer to begin with.
Is there anything I can do about this? I suppose the buyer hasn’t broken any rules but can I report them or something?

Ebay,PSA: eBay has been serving malware JS for at least a year!,"I was trying to buy a power cable on ebay yesterday when something weird happened. I went to ""recent purchases"" and got redirected to an amazon phishing site! Here's a video of the incident I took: https://twitter.com/yifanlu/status/1038856717180657664

Here's some technical background:

* I'm running stock iOS 11.4.1, the latest release. It is not jailbroken.
* No 3rd party certificates are in use
* The domain is clearly ebay.com and is on HTTPS
* The above should make this irrelevant, but I'm on my home wifi, not public/shared

Since I know there's no way I'm getting hit by an iOS 0day that was used to serve a JS phishing site, I downloaded Charles Proxy and dumped a traffic log and I found what I believe is the culprit: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DmrEZm6UYAEeW9c.png:large

The ""x.bidswitch.net"" one seemed to download a script that redirects to some random domain that eventually downloads a script that redirects to the phishing site.

I can think of a couple of reasons for this.

1. One of the third party ad providers were hacked or are malicious.
2. eBay's own ad server was hacked.

There's a high chance that #2 is the case. The malicious javascript from the screen above was downloaded from a ebay.com domain. The JS it loads lists a LOT of 3rd party ad providers. It would seem crazy to me that ebay has legitimate contracts with so many providers and would also choose to load them at once. If so, this is a separate issue where ebay has zero respect for user privacy by loading more than a dozen trackers from different companies, most of which I've never heard of before. The second giveaway is that a lot of these ads/trackers are loaded with URL params that seem to be spoofed. Such as ""ssp=aol"" (Referring to AOL?) and ""uid=[MM_UUID]"" (placeholder? bad coding? spoofing?) and a bunch of uid/ids that are hard coded. I even see a ""meid"" (should be unique for any CDMA phone) that is hard coded and not my MEID. So there is a high chance that this JS was not loaded with ebay's knowledge. But it was from ebay's domain and that means it has privilege to access anything ebay delivers to your computing device and anything your device thinks it's delivering to ebay.


In the course of my investigation, I noticed the redirect stopped happening after about 20 minutes after initial discovery. Dumping the logs again I've noticed the same ""napkinapi"" request started returning drastically different data. See for example https://gist.github.com/yifanlu/ea160aeaf0099669b45e72bc343e3dfd (I've removed anything that looks like uniquely identifying information). Now I'm unsure if this is ""legit ebay"" tracking but it passes the sniff test more than before. For one, it seems to be loading from just one provider instead of over a dozen. Second, it seems to contain a lot of unique params (which is more typical of a real tracker vs malware).


So was this a one-time incident and I just got lucky/unlucky? Or is there something more insidious like the malware deciding to only show up &lt; 100% of the time? I have evidence that it is the second case. First, from memory, I recall multiple instances in the past where I visited the ebay desktop site on my phone and I clicked a ""my ebay"" link and something weird happened. This ""weirdness"" was not always consistent but I remember getting an infinite refresh as well as getting blank page loads and once I was redirected to the HTTP page even though I was on https://ebay.com (that time actually started writing an angry email to ebay but just like this time, after half an hour or so, when I tried to record a video, I noticed it stopped happening and I thought maybe there was a screwup on my end). Then I was tipped off by a twitter user to google ""ebay redirect virus"" and ""ebay redirect spam"" and I found tonnes of instances of other people experiencing similar issues


Examples:

* https://community.ebay.com/t5/Technical-Issues/EBay-site-redirect-to-virus-scam/td-p/28292480 One reply near the bottom saw the same ""Spreeddiscount"" spam.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/7hcmpk/getting_redirected_to_scam_websites_by_ebay/ This was 9 months ago on this very subreddit
* https://community.ebay.com/t5/Archive-Technical-Issues/eBay-needs-to-stop-with-the-ad-redirects-to-spam-sites-You-are/td-p/24031752 This is from 2 years ago any may not be the same issue


What makes it hard to track down when this malware started is because I'm sure a lot of these reports ARE due to infected computers. Since it is well known that adware likes to redirect random sites you are browsing to a spam/phishing site HTTPS be dammed. And of course, just about every report I've seen was dismissed by other users as ""you're probably infected."" I would guess that people who ""reported"" this to ebay would get told the same line. Someone on twitter told me that they called ebay about this issue in the past and was told to disable ad personalization (lol). The other difficulty is that it's hard to reproduce because I tried dumping the traffic from my computer and I couldn't get it to reproduce. And as I said before, after about half an hour the behavior changes. And from personal experience, I only ever got weird behavior from my ebay from my phone, never my desktop. There's likely some device-specific targeting. With javascript, this would be trivial to do. I think a lot of us, me included, just thought we were crazy and didn't actually see anything weird. That could explain how it has remained undetected for so long. Another explanation could be that any tech savvy user likely has ad-blockers installed so most of these trackers would have been blocked. I actually do have an ad blocker in use but out of the dozens of trackers the script loads, at least one managed to slip through and hijacked the page.


Those with the technical expertise should try to collect more traffic dumps of the my ebay ""purchase history"" page (it seems to work in other my ebay pages as well, anything that uses that ""napkinapi"" but better to be consistent). I think if we have more samples with different accounts, different devices, different times, we can have a better idea of 1) what a ""legitimate"" tracking code looks like vs. malware code (tbh to me, all tracking is malware but I digress). 2) when the malicious code shows up and under what circumstances. I've tried looking for a security disclosure email from ebay but couldn't find any. The only thing was their phishing scam email report where I sent them my traffic dumps but never got a reply. I also tried tweeting at them, but no reply in the last 24 hours. I believe that posting this information publicly would not cause any harm because I am not disclosing (nor do I know) HOW ebay may or may not be hacked. I think it is important that users know that something might be up and that more research should be done before we can safely use ebay. **Even though I've only observed redirection to phishing pages, the fact that an unauthorized agent might be loading JS from ebay's domain onto your device means there's a high chance that they can capture any data sent to/from ebay to you including payment information, purchase history, and so on. This isn't a guaranteed but at this stage we cannot discount the possibility.**


**tl;dr**: There is a good chance that for at least a year (and maybe more), ebay or someone with access to ebay's ad servers has been silently serving malicious javascript that is redirecting users to ads/phishing pages and could be doing more that we don't know about. This malware seems to only loads at specific times for specific devices so the behavior isn't always reproducible and more research is needed.

This is meant to be a PSA--you are not forced to do anything.

Ebay,Ebay Account Suspended After Buying something???,"For some background: I have only tried to sell one item on eBay, but I took it down after no one bought it. Since then I've purchased two items in July and one in August (all from verified sellers) so I don't see why eBay's algorithm would wait until now to mark my account as suspicious. This happened last week but eBay says to wait until the estimated delivery date to try and resolve the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, I was looking to buy an iPhone X this month and decided eBay would be the best place to find a great deal considering I've bought more expensive items there before. I found a good price and the seller posted photos so I purchased the phone and everything went through as usual.

But of course this is where things go haywire.

A few minutes later I get an email from eBay saying my account has been suspended, but the email is void of any reasons as to what I did to get suspended: [https://imgur.com/a/p7kq5CZ](https://imgur.com/a/p7kq5CZ)

I've been on the phone for hours trying to get in contact with an agent but I got no response. I've tried eBay's Twitter but the same thing happens there. I've also emailed the seller and explained my situation but got no response.

What makes things worse is that the money has already been sent to the seller and the transaction is marked as ""completed"", but the item's been removed by eBay: [https://imgur.com/a/yWStNGs](https://imgur.com/a/yWStNGs)

Ebay,"Need advice from experienced sellers on inventory, etc.","I'm finally living my dream. I now have my own shop with a garage that's absolutely perfect to rob my eBay business out of. I have a ""reception area"", a ""private office "" and the rest is all garage.  
This is all I've ever wanted..I should be incredibly happy, but I'm not. I'm overwhelmed,  distraught,  and distracted all the time. 

I got this retail office so I could have all my stuff out if the house and in one location where I could do everything.
The office is an absolute mess. Stuff everywhere, no organization,  barely any room in the garage to walk, etc. Its a disaster zone. 
I'm getting behind on orders,  have no inventory record what so ever, and there is just stuff everywhere you look.
See my problem is I always over do everything.  My inventory consists of school surplus,  mostly electronics,  and my problem is I dont know what to throw away, what to part out, what to scrap, what to spend time into making better for higher resale. A good example is the computers.  I have a bunch of laptops and desktops that are still administrative password locked and have to be bypassed in order to reset them.  Its just too time consuming. But if I do figure out how to do all that the value doubles..

I just need advice from experienced sellers that work with large inventory lots,  or just anyone with some advice.  I'm not saying you have to be big time I'll take any advice. 

Please tell me what you do when you get large quantities of inventory.  How you break it down and organize it.  How you manage your time and just give me something that gives me a glimmer of hope and some motivation.

Ebay,Why do book sellers insist on shipping their books in bags? Almost all the books I ordered have come damaged.,"I ordered close to 20 books for $4-$5 listed as all like new or very good and they are starting to arrive last friday and today, and of the 8 I received 7 were damaged. All shipped in bags. Like new and very good are advertised as no page marking, folds, tears, little to no wear, unbroken spine, etc. In general stuff like that from the sellers. But all have come dented, mixed softcovers and hardcovers, smashed, actual dirt and glue marks, strong stickers that peel the paper and ink, broken spines, etc. 

What the hell? Isnt this all media mail and super cheap to ship even if its like 20lbs of books? Bag or box media mail is media mail and really cheap. Why the bag? One bag had holes all over it.

I did return requests for them and these sellers, who dont accept messages due to high sales volumes, all did auto instant refunds and saying I can keep the book.

Ebay,Intentionally sold a broken item,"Hi, 

A fews weeks ago I bought an item on Ebay. The item required me to buy some additional stuff to get it working, I've spend an additional $300 on ""accessories"". 

&amp;#x200B;

However when I received the item the unit was broken, and I discovered just by moving the unit it had an loose item inside. So I opened it up and found out that the item was not attached. 

I asked for a refund, that was accepted 1 minute (!!) after I submitted it, late evening. I found that to be strange. Sure I provided pictures but I would have guessed the seller would want to work with me to solve the issue. This was a fairly expensive unit &gt;$2000.

&amp;#x200B;

So when I investigated a but further it showed that the loose item did not even belong to the unit, the seller had just placed an random item in the unit hoping the buyer would not blame him/her for the mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got the unit for free as the seller is not asking for the unit to be shipped back, but I feel this is a fraud as it was intentionally sold broken. My ebay case is now closed as I got my refund but I'd to let ebay know I got a non working unit and I have claims ($300) above the purchase price (I realise that I might not get those back without suing the seller).

Ebay,"Jumped from selling $10 Funko For My First Item to a $5,500 Switch For My Second Item Any Recommendations Would Be Awesome","TLDR: I am a real guy with a really expensive item for my second eBay post ever is there anything I can do to improve the possibility/timeframe of it selling?

Hey guys, I am not a big eBay seller. To be honest I am just a  normal random guy and this is only my second time posting an item. My first item was just a Funko Doll that I had stilling around the house and no longer wanted. Because it was just something I no longer wanted I posted it like like 20% under other sellers and It sold almost instantaneously.

Then yesterday I was down in my mine (I have a medium sized cryptocurrency mine) and with prices the way they are decided I would sell some stuff. The most obvious candidate is a $5,500 switch that has literally been sitting in its original box INSIDE its original shipping box so literally mint condition for months. So I posted it for $4,500 ($500 less than the next one and $1000 less than I paid) because I want it gone and could really use the money right now.

My worry is will I have issues selling such an expensive item as my second item with only one feedback on a very small item before this. Would it help if I explained the situation in the post and said I am very much a real person and the item is real? I am a total noob at eBay and just want to get this sold ASAP.

Ebay,Detail questions about how eBay markdown sales work,"Does anyone have a link to a really good guide about exactly how ebay sales work (I mean 'markdown' sales specifically).

Specfically, I'm talking about ""overlapping"" sales.

e.g. 

* I put in a sale that says 'everything 10% off'...
* Then I make one that says ""things with this keyword 20% off""
* Then I make one that says ""anything over $500 30% off"" (yes, I realize I could put in 2 sales for &lt;$500 and over $500, but for the sake of argument...)
* Assume everything is eligible for markdown (that's not the question)

Does the 'highest discount"" prevail? Will it combine them all and apply ALL the discounts? Does it freak out and do nothing?

Both links to a good guide and/or direct answers welcome. Thanks in advance.

Ebay,Bet you can't figure out this scam...,"I've been selling on eBay for a few decades. Generally high dollar stuff. I'm used to the normal scams buyers run on sellers but this time I got scammed as the buyer and I have no idea what happened. 

On the 22nd of August I purchased a camera. It was $1000. The seller immediately uploaded tracking info for USPS that showed an estimated delivery date of the 30th of August. The price was suspiciously low and almost immediately after buying the item I looked at the seller's other offers and noticed that he had sold this item three times prior that same day. Ok, so it's a scam. I'll wait for the mystery package and then open a case once it ends up being an envelope full of air. 

So I wait and track the item. It ""arrives"" on the 27th only it's not there. USPS says ""left with individual"". The mail box place I use says they received no package. This is odd to me. I mean, how would this show as delivered when they received literally nothing and how could that be the seller's scam? The seller would have no control over that. 

So I wait. We buy a lot of stuff and generally take care of problem purchases in batches. Today I finally decide to dispute this. So I log into my account. I go to open a case and it says there's already a case open on it. What? That makes no sense. So I look at the case details and it says I opened a return on the camera on August 24th and then closed the return  minutes later. The reason for the return request was a missing lens cap and the reason for closing the return was that I found it in the bottom of the box. Only I didn't open this return request nor did I close it. Also the return request was opened and closed three days before the package shows it was delivered.

So I call eBay. They say that I CALLED in on the 24th. But I did not. I asked if she could pull the call and she said she could and that she would but whereas I was expecting her to explain to me just how I got scammed here, she had no answers. She was as dumbfounded as me. 

I just don't get all the coincidences. The package that said it was delivered but wasn't. And a return request that was opened by me but not opened by me. I have 2 step authentication set up on everything. The only thing I can think of was that my eBay account was compromised but how? Someone lists something on the site and then waits for someone to buy it at which point they just hope they can compromise that account? And how would my account have been compromised? I assume the return request/ return closure was just a ruse to show that I as the buyer was confirming receipt of the item. 

WTF happened here guys! I feel like I'm nuts.

I've replied to all of their messages within a couple hours while they've taken days, and I've provided all the help I can directly.

This is ridiculous. The buyer received an item that was exactly as described, their only problem is that they have unrealistic expectations.

Ebay,How to Report a Seller,"Hi /r/Ebay,

I recently purchased baby clothes from a seller on eBay.  The seller shipped me the wrong item.  

Ordinarily, this wouldn't be an issue, however the seller has been insanely difficult to deal with and I am not happy.

In our initial contact, the seller took ownership of the problem but implied that I was responsible for return shipping.  Instead, he offered me a 35% refund and I could keep the ugly outfit which I received (if we were happy with the outfit, we wouldn't even contact him, but it was ugly.

I told him that's not acceptable to us, and he lied and said that he couldn't do a full refund without receiving the return, but ""generously"" offered me 50% and whined about his profit margins.  In that same email, he asked me to leave him positive feedback. I suggested that he send me a prepaid shipping label  and his retort was sending me his address and but no shipping label.  I asked for a shipping label once again and he ignored my request.

I left him negative feedback, it seemed like the logical thing to do.  Suddenly, he changed his tune.  Now he wants me to revise my feedback and he's offered me a full refund, but I have to revise my review first (I thought he couldn't give me a full refund if I didn't ship the product back?!).  I think this is ethically questionable, plus I'm certain eBay will side with me after reading the messages.  I assume that manipulation of the feedback system (believe me, this seller deserves every bit of the feedback I gave him, every message has started with what he wants as a seller and not FIXING HIS MISTAKE) is heavily frowned upon by eBay, but I'm having trouble seeing where I can report this poor behavior.

Ebay,Ebay reneging on promise to give my buyer a partial refund on shipping because of GSP delays,"So, I sent my first order via eBay's Global Shipping Program. Long story short, it was delayed by a couple weeks, and when I talked to Ebay on the phone to see what the heck was going on with the package, they said that it would soon be shipped to the buyer, and promised that eBay would give the buyer a partial refund on shipping when it arrived, since the delay happened with GSP (I shipped the item the same day). The buyer then received the item about a week later.

Now, the buyer is contacting ME, and telling me that eBay told them that they should get the partial refund from ME via a PayPal partial refund (I didn't even charge anything for shipping). When I called eBay about this and told them that they promised my buyer a partial refund because the delay was on THEM, they are now sounding wishy washy and are seeming to go back on their word. They said that they would contact GSP, but that they usually do not do that (i.e. give shipping refunds). In the meantime, I'm the one looking bad to my customer, when I was and am just relaying the information given to me from them (eBay).

Also, to make things worse, the eBay representative said that they would contact the customer on my behalf, and ended up leaving a confusing message, fraught with spelling and grammar mistakes, and on top of it all, they used MY actual eBay email, making it look like I sent it.

Ebay,Customer wants to use my return policy to 'try' item I told him doesn't fit. Was I wrong to BBL?,"Guy writes up and says ""will your part off an '02 Model X fit my '06 Model X.""

I write back and say, ""no, it only fits '02-'04. You need an '05 or later.""

He writes back and says ""well it looks the same to me, if I buy it and it doesn't fit, can I still return it in 30 days?""

I responded ""It will not fit: the mounts and connectors are different."" Then BBL'd him.

Yes, I get that the part he's looking for is hen's teeth. Yes I know it would be nice for him if the one I have would fit. But it just ain't so.  Technically, mine could be made to fit with some modest modification (drilling &amp; threading one hole in aluminum bracket and splicing in his existing connector, if he has one), but a guy who has to ask about compatibility knowing enough to do that? I think not.

I mean for pete's sake... the pro who does this for a living says ""it won't fit"" but you ""think it looks the same""? Seriously?

Guy didn't do anything ""wrong""... per se but I see no way selling to him goes anything but wrong for me, right? BEST possible outcome is he pays shipping both ways, I refund him, part comes back unscathed, and I get + feedback... but have a desirable part off-sale for a month. It's downhill from there. 

I suppose I'll take comfort in the notion I BBL'd him ""for his own good""...and that he at least 'forewarned' me.

Hi,

Thanks for the fast response... I'm interested in buying this item as a surprise gift 

for my step son on a trip to AFRICA for his birthday which is few days from now.

And I'm pretty sure he would love this item since its in a good working condition.

I'm also willing to pay £240.00 GBP for this item and shipping of the item to him. 

I want item insured and shipped via Royal Mail Int'l tracked &amp; signed for, as that's the 

most reliable shipping company have known.

Send me a PayPal payment invoice or send me your paypal details to me 

so I can commence on payment if you accept my offer.

This is my email ( littlegood1671 at outlook dot com )

I actually wrote it like that because eBay wouldn't allow me write it the normal way.

Let me know as soon as you send the invoice.

Ebay,36 pence insertion fee?,"Hello all,

My first post in this sub. Now i don't want to come across all tight fisted as this is more a matter of principle than anything but...

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently being charged an insertion fee on all items of £0.36, but everywhere i have looked all I can find is articles claiming insertion fees should be £0.35, the smallest difference possible I know but over a lot of items and a lot of 30 days and it all begins to add up.

Can anyone think why the extra penny? there are no listing upgrades that cost one penny as far as I can tell. If this is just the price of an insertion fee I don't mind, just don't want to be paying too much. I am registered as a business seller if that makes any difference at all.

Ebay,Benefits of running an eBay business full time as your primary income.,"Being an entrepreneur of any sort is not easy, nor a path to ""working less"" (if you're gonna do it right), and generally really tough. Being an eBay entrepreneur is no different.

But it has its advantages, to me. Here are mine. I'd love to hear yours:

1) Work-life balance. I define this differently than most. It doesn't mean I work X:00 to Y:00 and don't think business outside that. Rather it means I can mostly work when I want and have 'off' time when others can't. Do I work on weekends? Yes. Do I work evenings? Yes. Can I have a day free if needed?... Yes.

2) I take great vacations a couple times a year. I shut down the store and go. I hit Sturgis, take the family to the beach for a week, go to the mountains and stay in a cabin hunting and shooting and hiking for a week, etc. No boss to ask, no need to 'check email' periodically, no worry that something's 'going down' while I'm away.

3) I've had a great time being with and there for my kids. I spent the first 7-8 years of their lives AWOL with a high-powered corporate job. I'd never go back to that. Since then I'm there. Soccer game at 3PM? Teacher conference at 11am? I can make it. Yeah, it's me and the soccer-moms while most of the dads have to work, but okay (and some of the soccer moms are pretty hot). Full properly cooked family dinner every night? No problem. That's important for us, so I'm there, I cook, we eat together and talk over our day. Either of my kids ever calls and says ""Dad, I need you"" I'm there. No 'I've traveling on business,' no 'I'm in a meeting right now' no nothing: I'm there. My biggest issue there is they're both off to college in 1-2 years respectively, and I'm not sure WTF I'll do then! 

4) I like it. I know that sounds funny, but I know so many 'traditionally employed' folks that just hate their job and only do it as a means to an end. I did that for years and years, and mostly hated it. Now that I 'cut the cord' I actually -like- what I do. *It's why I'm here: I dig talking about it, helping others with it, learning from what others say.* My single #1 piece of advice to prospective entrepreneurs is simply this: you gotta love it. If you're ""just doing it"" then go buy a pair of Nike's and get a job. You gotta want it, need it, love it for its own sake or you won't succeed. What's the point of business? Business. If that seems crazy or weird or nonsensical to you... don't do it. When that eBay app on your phone makes the cha-ching sound you gotta go ""woohoo!"" and mean it. Some entrepreneurs and business coaches will say you gotta be able to separate yourself from your business. I disagree. If you have a bad revenue day and you are NOT depressed, driven to find out why and spending your time going nuts to 'fix it' then you shouldn't be in business.

5) Tax advantages / Mo Money. I consider it the single most unfair part of our tax code, how business and individuals are taxed differently. But that doesn't stop me taking full (legal, legit) advantage of it. As an 'individual' you have to pay taxes on your income (revenue) and then pay all your expenses out of the after tax money. As a business you start with your revenue (income) but then DEDUCT all your expenses and only pay taxes on what's left (profit). I'm a proud American and happy to pay my fair share. OTOH, if painting my business name and number on the side of my car makes it a deductible business expense - at least partly - vs. a personal after-tax expense... I just LOVE promoting my company while I drive!",9,7,2018-09-16,EBAY,0.051939573138952255,0.9174104928970337,0.030649954453110695

Ebay,[Seller] Cancel transaction or open Unpaid Item Case?,"I have an item that I offered free shipping on, however I set the listing to ""no international shipping.""

Well, a buyer from another country purchased one of the small quantity I have listed, time of purchase was early morning on the 13th. It was a BIN but they didn't pay immeadiately.

I messaged them when I got the alert on my phone (i.e. right away) and told them that while I would be willing to send the item to them, I couldn't offer free shipping internationally and (after checking the USPS website) that the cost of shipping would likely be almost as much as the item itself. I asked what they wanted to do and said I could either send them an invoice with shipping costs included or I could cancel the transaction.

Yesterday evening I hadn't received a response so I sent a follow-up message asking what they wanted me to do. I still haven't received a response and we're now past 48hrs with no contact and no payment.

It got me thinking..I remember seeing on some forums before that the speed and frequency with which you respond to buyer messages can affect your visibility. I have no data to support this, just something I've seen repeated a few times.

Is there any truth to this? My problem is that I sell in a niche and have made a few ""eBay friends"" that message me multiple times a day about items in the niche, new releases, etc. I should just cut them off, I know, but I feel bad and don't mind too much, so I reply to them every now and then but don't drive myself crazy. Does anyone think it's possible that responding to maybe 2 or 3 of every 10-20 of these messages can somehow affect sales?",2,6,2018-09-18,EBAY,0.10956525802612305,0.8521135449409485,0.03832114487886429
Ebay,What's the catch? Just bought a sketchy laptop listing on ebay.,"This morning at 3am, I was scoping out the  acer predator helios 300 like I normally do. Trying to get  myself a good deal. I say to myself that if I can get it for less than $600 it's a good deal because it recently came out so it's mostly people  who bought something they can't afford who want to liquidate it. It retails for roughly $1200.

I found an interesting listing. $500, buy it now for an acer predator 17. Brand new...somehow.

The listing description was entirely in spanish and was just a copy-paste of the product specs.

The pictures consisted of stock photos from the acer website and one photo stolen from a review site.

The seller was listed as living in Mexico. However, after I bought it, it says that it is shipping from Hong Kong/Taiwan.

The seller has zero feedback and appears to have just signed up to list this one laptop.

Interestingly  enough, the product description claims that the laptop contains a GTX  1080 which is actually the Acer Predator 17X.

The model number is ""G9-793-706f"" which is a version of the Acer 17 only available in Mexico containing the GTX 1060 6GB.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what's the angle? I don't mind floating $500 for maybe getting a sick laptop for more than half off. What should I look out for when purchasing listings like this?

If I do get anything in the mail I'm going to make sure to video myself unboxing it, showing the tracking numbers just in case it goes to arbitration.

Ebay,Sales dropped to 0 for over a week. Any advice?,"Hello! 

I typically get 1 or 2 sales a day on my eBay. The last month alone I had only one day I didn't have a sale. Now, since September 7th I have had 0 sales.

It's really weird. My sales graph is full, and then after that day it's been nothing! I have an etsy account selling the same stuff and the sales have been better than ever...

Is it possible there's some kind of glitch or something I'm doing wrong preventing people from buying or seeing my products? I've been on eBay for 2 years now and never had this long of a dry spell, and it's weird that it just hit all of the sudden. 

I talked to a  friend who has an eBay account and he recommended taking down all my listings and relisting all of them individually, but I have over 100 on there. If that will really fix it, I would do it, but wanted to get some other advice first.

Ebay,Handling a persistent blocked buyer,"So this guy reaches out a couple months ago and makes a non-ridiculous but fairly low (40% off) offer on an item. The item does NOT have OBO enabled, this is via messaging. 

We replied with our standard text... ""Thanks for your interest, but we don't consider offers on items without OBO enabled""...

Before doing that, I checked his profile and his feedback left for others is a sea of red, and all generic ""Bad communication."" So I immediately BBL'd him.

Since then, a barrage of communication. Initially I just ignored them, but the volume/consistency was such I figured I better have a look. None rude, none crazy, just continuing his lowball offer every couple days. All told 3-4 items, all parts for the same car, on which we're now getting a couple messages from him per day. 

I see why he'd say ""Bad Communication"" if his expectation is sellers respond to all that!  

I don't think he's tried to buy anything, or I'd get the dreaded ""What? You blocked me???"" note. But I fear that's coming if/when he ""capitulates"" and tries to buy at asking price. He seems ""OCD"" enough to try a runaround like use his GF's account to buy then neg and 1-star us...  I can't be the first seller that's blocked him!

We do have a polite but firm note we've sometimes used when folks go into ""You blocked me!"" hysterics. I'm wondering if maybe it's better to send that now or just let him keep at it until he gets tired of radio silence or tries to pull something...?

in summary: fees going up and ebay hates sellers


## Sales Support phone number

&gt; Provide your customer support phone number to answer buyers' questions before the sale

Only the bigger stores can manage to do this... and you just know search results will favour those stores that do

## Ebay's payment system: 

&gt; Managed payments for simplified buying and selling

&gt; You will benefit from consolidated pricing, simpler invoicing of your fees, and __daily payouts direct to your bank account__

This is a warning flag that ebay could now potentially threaten to with-hold a whole day's worth of payments or at least have money to force refund buyers without you being able to stop them. also as it's direct to your bank account they'll also be able to take money out of your account...

&gt; eBay expects to transition the majority of sellers to the new payment experience by 2021

I read elsewhere paypal has a contract with ebay until 2023


&gt; Will this affect my seller fees? __Most sellers can expect lower overall selling costs__. All sellers will also benefit from a simplified pricing structure and more visibility to sales and payouts.

## Fee updates: 
- Reserve price, Subtitle, and Value Pack feature fee increase, 
- Starting October 4, 2018, unlimited insertion fee credits for auction-style listings that end in a sale will be available exclusively to US and Canadian Store subscribers with Basic, Premium, Anchor, and Enterprise Store subscriptions. __Starter Store subscribers and non-Store sellers will no longer receive these insertion fee credits.__ Only listings created after you sign up for a Store subscription will be eligible for a credit.

This is why ebay has been running lots of insertion credits encouraging sellers to use gtc listings... so they can charge sellers when these credits stop and the listings will auto-relist

- Media price increase: Starting September 15, 2018, __the final value fees for Books, and DVDs &amp; Movies categories will increase from 9.15% to 12%__ for Store subscribers and from 10% to 12% for non-Store sellers.
- Starting September 15, 2018, the __final value fees for the Music category will also increase from 9.15% to 12% for both Store subscribers and non-Store sellers,__

Buyer contacts eBay saying he never bid and that someone hacked his account. eBay cancelled auction before I even saw his message. I’m beyond frustrated at this point. I relist on the 24th for 3 days. It sells for $102.50 again. Buyer pays. Shipped it. Added tracking. All good. So I wait for the coupon that says it’ll arrive 9/14. No coupon comes. I call. Had all the info ready. Explained coupon and gave reference number for the offer. Gave her all 3 item numbers as well. She says I see. As a one time courtesy, we will reward the coupon. But I will send it to billing department and I will call you back when they do it. I’m like great. Next day I get a VM from her saying to check my email. Didn’t mention declined.

This is June from Billing Department.

It was denied by our Accounts Manager as the original transaction was not successful.


So basically they denied it even though it was relisted(twice) and sold by 8/30 but the first transaction failed because of the BUYER, which I still have in my eBay messages from the buyer stating he wont be paying.

I was asking for 100% as I purposely buy things only within Canada for multiple reasons. One of them being there’s no unexpected custom fees. 

Will eBay side with me if I decline the sellers offer of 50% of the customs fees? I expected to only pay what I paid at the checkout but was given this unexpected charge of $57 Canadian. Is the seller lying about the item location enough to insure I get 100% of the custom fees refunded ?

Any ideas or sugggestions would be appreciated.

Ebay,M25OFFSEP Fall Sale Coupon not applying to Officially Listed Items (for that particular sale),"I logged in to Ebay and found placards aplenty telling me all about the Fall Sale, where all I'd have to do is pick an item from the massive list of stuff and apply the code M25OFFSEP on checkout to get a 25% discount.

Ebay,Variation Listings - had a listing taken down even though it's common practice. Anyone else been cracked down on recently? Ebay UK,"So I have a load of Xbox 360 games that are only worth a couple of pounds each. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the last several months I have been selling them on ebay UK using a variation listing (in part because it's a simple way to organise my listings rather than having 100 separate ones I have to keep track of / renew / take down if I go on holiday etc, and also because if I run out of free listings the 35p insertion charges mean out of a £2 sale ebay is essentially taking 25% of my sale - which after postage and paypal means I may get 30-40p per game if I'm lucky). Personally I hate the variation listing  shopping experience, but clearly a lot of ebay customers don't because these listings of mine get the most views (in the 1000's) and sell really well.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I received an email saying one of my variation listings has been taken down. Apparently I'm breaking the rules. I called ebay to ask what the? and they have told me it's their policy, nothing has changed, and it's always been not allowed. Curiously when you make a variation listing in the video game category, 'Game Name' is a preset option, so seemingly that implies you can do different games within the same listing - contradicting their rules?

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is, aside from the fact that I personally have 5 other variation listings up (so clearly there is ZERO consistency in this policy) soooooo many other people are doing the exact same thing - including 'top rated sellers' I follow, and including 2 scammer sellers I and others have repeatedly reported to ebay wiith zero effect. The link they sent me to explaining why I was in trouble explained that people may get confused, unhappy customers, avoiding insertion fees blah blah blah. Well I've sold almost 150 games in the last 2 months and I've had 0 complaints. I have had almost 95 positive feedbacks from these sales (and no negative or neutral). I'm also pretty different in that in my variations I include a picture of every single item (the exact one I send) and clearly describe EVERY SINGLE ITEM in detail). Most people with similar variations have a blanket statement saying 'conditions may vary' etc and use stock images so you have little idea what you're getting. And most of the time I have loads of free listings so I don't pay insertion fees anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finding ebay extremely frustrating lately as every time I make some progress / sell some stuff / get in my groove they sh\*t on me - and I feel singled out because I'm not doing anything different to anyone else. It's also driving me mad watching people cheat and get rewarded, and I'm feeling like I'm doing the right thing by my happy customers and I get nothing but grief from both ebay and PayPal.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know why my listing would have been taken down (as in is it because someone reported me etc or did I do something wrong when listing that may have flagged me up)? Has this supposed 'crackdown' I was told was taking place by ebay customer service caught any of you? Anyone know of a way around it? Would be interested to hear if anyone else has been stung :)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Been using 'variation listings' to sell a pile of video games, had listing taken down because I'm breaking the rules. Everyone else does this so don't see why I'm being singled out. Has this happened to anyone else? And why am I being targeted?

Ebay,Should I Post Negative Feedback (Seller),"Hello Everyone

I would appreciate an impartial second opinion.

I sold a vintage video game and there was a bidding war. The winning bid was 306 USD but he never sent payment. I reported to ebay and they refunded my selling fees for that transaction and I was able to take advantage of the second chance offer.

I emailed the second highest bidder and he accepted and bought the item at 302. So in reality I only lost 4 USD plus a bunch of aggravation and wait time. In all, by the time the second winning bidder paid, I waited about 3 weeks.

I have been tempted to post negative feedback on the first guy but have been afraid of retaliatory feedback. Let it go or not?

Ebay,Advice about retaliatory feedback,"Thank you in advanced and I apologize because my story is a bit long. I am both a buyer and seller on eBay. I am mostly a buyer but I maybe sell 1-3 items a year. I collect coins and currency and found a seller selling many notes at a decent price. I purchased six notes on six different transactions. They all arrived and they felt really off to me. They did not feel genuine at all. I took them to an exchange and they agreed that they were likely not genuine. I messaged the seller expressing my concerns, but he did not respond. After waiting about 3-4 days I decided he was likely never going to respond. Because I was dissatisfied with the counterfeit notes, I posted negative feedback for all six transactions and returned them. A few hours later he accepted all the returns, still not replying to any message. About a hour after he accepted the return, I received notification that I had sold four out of my eight listings on my own seller profile all within 30 minutes of each other. This seemed odd since I rarely get one sale, so getting four back to back is insanely unusual. These sales were all to different eBay accounts. One eBay account was the eBay account I left poor feedback on in my own purchase discussed above. The second was to an account with the same name and address as the first eBay account. The third was to an address in the same city. The fourth did not appear related at first glance. This situation made me nervous since I highly suspected all these accounts belonged to the account I left bad feedback for. Fearing that I would be scammed out of my products, i cancelled all four orders. About a hour after that, all four eBay accounts posted poor feedback on my profile describing how I was a scam artist and a fraudulent seller. 

How do I deal with this situation? Is there anything I can do? Should I not post negative feedback on profiles?",10,5,2018-09-22,EBAY,0.3911092281341553,0.5865685939788818,0.02232210338115692

Ebay,Permanently Suspended just after creating an account,"Earlier tonight I tried to make an account to buy a monitor, but I decided to bid on it to see if I could possibly score it for a lower price.

Ebay,Need advice - buyer claims not receiving item despite tracking showing item delivered and signed for.,"A month ago I shipped an expensive item ($400) to the buyer with FEDEX with signature required. The address was for a UPS Store (Am guessing the buyer has a mailbox there) A few days later, I saw in the tracking item had been delivered and signed for.

Today  (a month later), all of a sudden, the buyer contacts me that he had not received the package. I told him that I see that it was delivered and gave him name of the person who signed for it and told him to check with that ups store.

Anyway it's an expensive item and am worried buyer is trying to scam me or something. If he opens a Item not received dispute, would I win it since I have a tracking number that shows the item delivered?

The buyer himself has a lot of positive feedback so maybe he isn't lying and the package got misdelivered somehow (though not my fault?), but what's very weird is that I'd have assumed after buying an expensive item like this he would  not have waited a month to check the tracking (which I uploaded to ebay the same day), also doesn't ebay notify him that a package has been shipped and delivered?

Ebay,Forgot to Monitor EBay Account for 5 months. What will happen??,"Hi Everyone,

I wasn't able to monitor my Ebay account for about  5 months due to some family and personal issues. These were some very tumultuous times and my Ebay account was the last thing on my mind. I didn't even check the email associated with my account. During that time (about 5 months ago) 2 orders were placed for $6.50 each. Since I wasn't able to monitor the account, I didn't ship the items.

One buyer filed a case with Ebay and  Ebay refunded them their money. The other did not file a case at all.  

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I finally logged in and I saw the activity which happened when I was absent. I immediately issued the buyer who did not file a case a refund. Furthermore, I send both buyers  messages sincerely apologizing for what happened. The buyer who never filed a case acknowledged my apology. The other did not. 

My questions now are:

1. What should I do now? 
2. Am I in any sort of trouble because of this? I never intended for any of this to happen. I do plan to closing my Ebay account because of my other commitments.

Ebay,Account suspended for selling something other users sell.,"Hello fellow redditors. I'm posting this in the hope someone that works on ebay can enlight me on what just happened and maybe warn others.

I've been a member of ebay uk since 2008. I've used it mainly to buy things. Used the bid option maybe twice. Last Saturday I saw users selling a fortnite skin code for ps4 and thought in doing the same. 

So I listed the code, informing that was to be sent by email once the purchase was done. Well, after 8 hours or so, ebay suspended my account, saying ""Your account was suspended because it exhibits a risk to eBay and to its community. As eBay is an internet-based business, and its members are our customers, we have to carefully weigh the risks involved in allowing users on our site.""

I contacted the customer support this morning and they say the decision is final. No appeals. Even when I stated that other users were doing the same thing.  ""We're not comfortable with your selling practices or business model, and we feel they don't help to promote a positive buying and selling environment"".

So, if any of you is trying to sell something similar be careful. If you have any insight about this, please respond to the post or pm me.


Update: I have my account back thanks to a very helpful and nice ebay representative. After I told my whole story by phone, he looked into the situation and explained that, since I've never sold anything, my account was flagged as a possible unathourized use (someone could hacked my account and used to sell a digital good). 

This served as a lesson. No selling of digital goods on ebay ever again. Thank you to all of you for your help and a big thanks to Eric of Ebay UK costumer service.",15,2,2018-09-24,EBAY,0.05538685619831085,0.9135738611221313,0.031039291992783546
Ebay,"""I'll pay this and nothing more, then blame you because it was too much!""","I'm cleaning out some old mailboxes and came across this gem from a couple of years ago so I thought I'd share.

**TL;DR: I accepted a buyer's offer for two hard drives. Buyer took several days to pay, then complained about the cost and the delivery speed before harassing me, lying to ebay, damaging my item, and generally being a world-class prick.**

I had a couple of external hard drives to sell so I listed them on ebay as BIN with Best Offer enabled. The drives were posted on a Sunday as a seven-day listing. On Tuesday a buyer made an offer which wasn't lowball but was lower than I liked. I made a counteroffer. On Wednesday morning he made a counteroffer which split the difference, and a few hours later I accepted it and sent him the invoice.

Wednesday ended with no payment. Thursday came and went, no payment. Friday morning I sent him a pleasant, polite reminder. No payment. Saturday morning, still nothing.

Saturday evening at around 9:30pm, the buyer finally submits payment and immediately demands a tracking number. Because I was busy with my family I didn't actually see that payment and message until Sunday morning. I printed out the receipt and shipping label (which automatically posted the tracking number) and packed everything up nicely. It being Sunday, there was nowhere for me to drop off the box for shipping.

Then the campaign started.

1. The first PM was my buyer expressing his disappointment that he didn't have the drives yet, and ""for the money (he) paid"" the shipping time was terrible. I reminded him that (a) I didn't receive payment until Saturday night, (b) the earliest possible ship time was Monday morning, and (c) *I* didn't set the price but rather *he* made the offer, so if he thought it was too expensive he should have lowered his offer.
2. The second PM said that I was ""ripping him off"" and that I should have hand-delivered the drives myself. (He was in NY, I'm in NJ, so it would be about 2-3 hour drive in both directions.) I reminded him that if he had paid for his purchase at the time I accepted his offer, he would have had the drives already. I told him if he wanted to cancel the transaction I would be more than willing to do so.
3. The third PM was little more than a threat against me, that I had better get his drives to him ""or else"". I told him I intended on dropping off the drives at UPS first thing Monday morning.
4. The third PM (sent Monday morning *after* I had dropped off the drives at USPS) was a demand for a full refund. I told him he can refuse the package and, after the drives were returned to me, I would happily give him a refund -- provided the drives were in the exact same condition as I sent them, as per ebay's rules. He followed that up with an accusation that I was lying about shipping the drives (despite the tracking information showing that the package had been accepted at the counter).
5. I then got notification from ebay that my buyer had requested my personal details, and I similarly received his. I then started getting emails from the buyer rather than through ebay's PM system. Every email he sent to me, I copied/pasted and replied to him via ebay's PM system.
6. Via email, he said that I'm ""ripping him off"" because I overcharged for the drives, didn't meet the delivery window, and I'm lying about having shipped the item. I again reminded him that *he* set the price for the drives, the delivery window starts counting down when payment was received, and the tracking information shows the item en route. He just blew all that off, then told me that when the drives arrive he plans on taking a hammer to them and then filing an INAD claim to get a full refund.
7. I called USPS and asked for the package to be returned to sender. Unfortunately they couldn't guarantee an interception. I looked up the buyer's ship-to address and discovered it was a UPS Store, not a residential home. I called the store (it was after hours) and left a message that briefly explained the situation and asked them to refuse the package, giving them the tracking number for reference.
8. The following morning I get a mocking, angry voicemail from the buyer telling me that I've ""broken federal law"" by asking the UPS Store to refuse the package, and he intends on contacting them and filing charges. I called the UPS Store and ask if (buyer's name) is available. I'm told to hold on and a few seconds later a different person gets on the phone. I hang up, now having learned that my buyer works at the UPS Store in question and undoubtedly retrieved my message and deleted it. About an hour later I asked to speak to the manager and was forwarded to my buyer again. Wonderful.
9. Two days later I get an email from the buyer telling me that he's filing an INAD because one of the drives doesn't work. Action follows; he files an INAD and wants a FULL refund in order to return ONE of the drives. I provide ebay with all of the back-and-forth communication, then follow it up with a phone call to ebay. Ebay agrees that he can either return both drives for a full refund, or one drive for a half refund.
10. The buyer ships a package and is refunded half. He sends me taunting emails about enjoying his ""free"" hard drive, apparently not bright enough to be aware that he's only been refunded half.
11. The package arrives at my house. It had *clearly* been dropped several times. The aluminum case is badly warped in several places, with deep gouges on it, and is very shoddily packaged. The only thing in the box is the drive, the power supply, and literally one piece of brown kraft paper. I call ebay and provide them with pictures and testimony. I am told that I need to fill out a form, then have it notarized and faxed to them.
12. The next day I jump through ebay's hoops. I call ebay and confirm delivery of the fax.
13. Several days (and phone calls from me) later, ebay closes the case. I'm still out the drive and money. I call ebay and, with as much honey as I can, ask what I did wrong. I followed all of the rules, the buyer did not. I kept all of my communication via ebay, the buyer did not. I was courteous and professional and polite throughout it all, the buyer was not. What was it that ebay says I did wrong which would warrant me losing this case? After perhaps an hour of going through multiple people (always politely), I'm told that ""as a courtesy"" ebay will refund my $200 which they do.
14. I send a screen shot of the refund notices I received to my buyer, and thank him for his business before blocking him on ebay and setting up an email redirect so that every email he sends to me is simply sent back to him.

I keep his UPS Store bookmarked on Google Maps so that if I'm ever in the area, I can stop by and say hello.",20,42,2018-09-25,EBAY,0.05873668007552624,0.9088272452354431,0.03243610821664333

Ebay,"Buyer went straight to paypal claim, bypassed Ebay","Not sure what to do in this situation so advice would be welcomed.    
I had a message via paypal that a buyer had put in a dispute with the reason ""want a refund"" , I messaged back via the paypal dispute no problem, just open a return request in Ebay and you can send back for a full refund.    
The buyer then without messaging me back when straight to claim so ignoring my suggestion about opening a return in Ebay.    
So I had four options in paypal , one was to accept the return and will refund when it's back , seemed a no brainer as that is what would happen anyway, only thing is that I would lose the refund on my selling fees but I could dispute that with Ebay later.    
Now here is the problem - I accept the option for the buyer to send back and I would refund BUT because it was an overseas order and we send all overseas orders via the Ebay GSP program, paypal have listed the return address for the buyer to send back to is the UK Ebay GSP Hub instead of my address (which is the same address that we have registered on our paypal account).    
So there is little chance (if any) that if the buyer sends back to that address that we are going to get our goods back for me to refund it.    
I presume the best action is just to give paypal a call to discuss the problem but should I also involve Ebay on it as well as the buyer has bypassed the normal procedure of dealing with return requests.    
Any advice from anyone?

EDIT: Ok just to follow up I contacted Paypal and they weren't sure why I was seeing that the return address was to the GSP Hub as they said on their side it saw our paypal registered address which is the info that they passed on to the buyer.",8,6,2018-09-25,EBAY,0.10348370671272278,0.8709424734115601,0.025573818013072014

Ebay,How can I save sold listings longer?,"Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I sell used car parts on eBay. This summer I dissected an old car in my garage and i am selling everything across 150-200 different listings. Each listing can take 15-20 minutes to create because it involves looking up part numbers, cross-referencing which other cars a part might work in, figuring out shipping details, etc. Now I'm at the point where my 90-day old sales are starting to expire. I really down't want to lose this information, because I might tear apart another car this winter. How can I preserve as much of these listings as possible? I can turn them into drafts, but that only buys me another 30 days, right? Is there anything else i can do?

Doesn't the Xbox One install games fully on the system, so that if there was something wrong with the disc it would have been found out on the install of the game?  And doesn't the system just run a basic disc check after the install of the game to see if you still own the physical copy of the game when you try to launch it?

I mean he basically is mad because I gave him exactly what he bought. He must have purchased this without looking at a single picture or even reading the title. I think this is a clear sign of buyer's remorse

Any hope of winning or is eBay just too far gone at this point?

EDIT: UPDATE!

I just got off the phone and the rep was as unhelpful as always. 

He said basically "" I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not sure what will happen for this. It's clear the buyer didn't read the description."" and I said. ""OK so how do I proceed."" and he responded ""Don't do anything. If you get the item back call eBay"" 

I asked him like 5 times ""what does that mean??"", are they accepting the return for me? Is he getting a refund? am I paying for the return label? What's happening? and he just kept saying vague things like ""well just wait, eBay will contact you. on October 2nd"" or ""just wait until the item shows up and then call eBay""

Ebay,Ebay Auto Accepted a Return but claiming I did it.,"So I sold an item August 13th and it was delivered August 16th.

Today September 27th they requested a return because the buyer said they bought it by mistake and Ebay accepted it automatically. 

To be clear I logged into my account and the return showed up as having been accepted and the only option I had was to either pay for a shipping label or give them a full refund.

I have no problem accepting returns but this was outside of the 30 day window so I would have declined it.

I called Ebay and they basically said that they did not automatically accept it and that I did.  When I told them I didn't they said my account was compromised.

So they passed me to an ""account safety expert"" who told me that no one but me had logged onto my account (which they supposedly verified by Ip address) and that I must have accidentally clicked accept return. 

They also said that they couldn't undo the accepting of the return because they can't ""undo the actions of the seller"".

You can make fun of me if you want for this but I am 100% positive I didn't accept it because I was raiding in World of Warcraft at the time and wasn't on Ebay at all.  I didn't even notice I had a return until 4 hours after I supposedly accepted it.

So is this some kind of Ebay glitch ?  Has it happened to anyone else here ?  Or do I have a secret hacker living in my house that only logs on my Ebay account to accept returns for me.

EDIT: I wonder if Ebay accepts Warcraftlogs as evidence.  I was literally in the middle of fighting Taloc Heroic when I supposedly accepted it !  At least I know I am not insane I guess.

EDIT 2:  So I called back the next day and this time the rep said that Ebay did in fact accept the return and that because I had free returns on the item it auto accepts return request.  However the rep had no idea why it auto accepted more than 30 days after the item was delivered and said it shouldn't be happening.

So the Rep closed the case in my favor and the funds are released back to me.  He also said he would forward this case to higher ups to fix the issue of it auto accepting returns after the return window is over.

Just mystifying all around and the vastly different experiences based on the rep I get is just insane to me.",8,2,2018-09-28,EBAY,0.05895782634615898,0.9102201461791992,0.03082205355167389

Ebay,Need help with claims.,"Hey guys, I posted this problem before, but now my head is clear and a lot more light has shone on what has happened.  I shipped a GTX 960 (Graphics Card) to a buyer, he then carried it in a backpack to Thailand, and finally claims the card is broken. He wants a full refund, even though the card still works, but is stuck in a low resolution with green lines.

1. I put the card in an anti-static bag then proceeded to wrap it with bubble wrap. I put the card in a box where it wouldn't move around.
2. When the buyer received the card, he says the box was a little messed up but the card was still in good condition. This is early August.
3. It's now September 27th and he messages me saying ""The card worked for 4 days, but then got green lines running through it"" He then took it to a shop and he says they tried every trick they know, but it's the card that is broken.
4. He sent me pictures of the broken graphics card (It looks fine?) and pictures of his monitor with the card in. He says the resolution is stuck at a low resolution and boot time is at over 3 minutes while his 560 takes only about 30 seconds.

The buyer has since opened a return claim, but the card DID work when he received it and I had declared in my listing no returns, I have no idea what he's done to it or if it broke in the backpack, and he states that shipping from Thailand to U.S is about $100. Am I at fault? Do I give him the refund? Sorry if the post is the exact same, I just wanted to add more details.

Ebay,First time instrument sale - buyer wants a return,"Listed a Fox Renard oboe for $1650 that I played in school. A user that resales instruments offered $1500 and I accepted. It was listed as used with 10 pics or so and no returns.

I explained this but he started a return request. I have no option to deny the request. In my opinion he has buyers remorse and feels that he can't resale it for enough profit?
