Ebay,Have I out scammed a potential scammer on eBay?,"Hey this is me popping my reddit posting cherry but anyway here's the scenario:
I recently decided to sell for the first time on eBay and have been a buyer for the last year with no problems.
Anyway I sold the item which they have paid for through paypal, sent the goods off well packaged (electrical goods) and have photos of them working on date of dispatch. They were most definitely working perfect and well packaged. 
I then got a little suspicious between looking at their previous products bought and decided to straight away transfer the funds into my bank a/c and now I have the cash.
Next as I had previously expected I get the ""these goods are faulty and I want a full refund"" message along with a sob story about such and such and they then proceeded to open a case as I had not replied to the message in 10 hours even though I had previously been in regular contact without a reply.
Well anyway I researched online and found this to sound very like a scam that happens where somebody has something that doesn't work then buys the same good and replaces it with the broken one and expects you to refund them and send their piece of crap back to you.

I am still waiting on the final result of the case and am wondering as I have the money and I no longer care about my account on eBay, or my paypal account, do any of ye wise redditors think I may have I beat this scammer? 

I am also wondering can eBay do a chargeback from a credit card previously linked with paypal account? I had my bank a/c from which I transferred the funds into linked aswell but I removed both credit card and bank a/c and a visit to my bank told me they cannot take anything without my permission and to bring any letters etc into them to examine.

Thanks for your time in reading this and if anything isn't really explained well I apologise and will explain again any questions you may have.",2,0,2011-06-10,EBAY,0.05835900455713272,0.9068019390106201,0.034839071333408356
Ebay,How is your shipping station set up?  What's your Workflow?,"In the near future I'm planning on starting to sell/ship a large quantity of items (sports and Magic cards).  I'm wondering what fellow redditors have for a setup:

* Do you print your shipping labels through eBay?
* Do you have a specific label printer and scale?
* If you sell a lot of the same sized item do you use a flat-rate shipping cost or is it all calculated on distance?
* Any tips?",5,6,2011-06-12,EBAY,0.026497527956962585,0.9338564872741699,0.03964594006538391

Ebay,"selling laptop on ebay, buyer marked payment as ""sent"" but not received, help?","Any help is much appreciated! I'm new to selling high-value items on ebay, so any help is much appreciated.

I put up a listing for a laptop on June 2nd. It was a 7 day auction. It ended up selling for $1,075.00 on the 9th to a guy who has only 2 feedback, but 100% positive.

On the 10th, he marked the payment as sent via Ebay (PayPal payment only), however I have received nothing in my paypal account, no email, nothing. I double-checked to make sure I had the right paypal address listed for the auction, and I did.

I've messaged the guy numerous times on ebay and via email, but no response at all. I opened a dispute via Ebay, but STILL no word from him.

I really needed this to sell, I'm in desperate need of cash right now. Sigh.

Anyone have any tips of how to get my money? thank you.",4,0,2011-06-13,EBAY,0.038943465799093246,0.9077829718589783,0.05327356606721878

Ebay,Being charged for warranty repair because I bought it on eBay,"Hi folks.

I bought a professional digital recorder off Ebay back in November. It's been used extensively in a completely safe studio environment since and yesterday one of the mics died, completely.

Tascam is now telling me I have to pay for the repair because I bought it on eBay - is this true? It is still under warranty and again, has worked for almost 8 months without issue.

I've written to the seller to see if I can get a receipt/maybe return it to the original dealer through him.

Am I out of luck? Thanks.

Edit: They are now refusing to supply me with a copy of the warranty, saying that ""this is one of the pitfalls of buying on ebay"" and that I should have it.",9,1,2011-06-27,EBAY,0.018110590055584908,0.8335031867027283,0.1483861654996872
