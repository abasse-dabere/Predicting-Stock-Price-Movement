Ebay,Seller listed Buy It Now item again the day after purchase?,"Hi all.

I purchased a Buy It Now item - took it to the cart, check out, filled out payment details, etc - and placed the order. I assumed everything would be fine, until checking back today and noticing the very item I purchased had been relisted by the seller. Normally, I'd assume they have multiple copies, but the item in question was a fairly old and somewhat rare game with the box and related items (manual, etc), so I'm skeptical they'd have multiple sets. Not helping my suspicions is the fact that the re-listed item has the same name, same description, same price, same picture - pretty much as if it was never bought.

I have not received any messages that the seller has taken action regarding the purchase, so I'm a little puzzled what to do here. (much as I'd like to assume the best, it seems unrealistic here)

Now, had this happened occur within the one-hour cancellation period, I would've just done that, made a note not to buy from that seller, and moved on. But well, it seems they waited until that was no longer an option for me.

This is a situation I haven't encountered. So realistically; what's the proper action to take here? Contacting the seller and asking if there's an issue with my order? Wait, and file an Item Not Recieved if the delivery date passes?

Ebay,Sold a game recently. Buyer messaged me today saying it doesn't work. What are my options?,"Hi all,

I sold a game about 4 days ago and shipped it out on New Years Eve. Today the buyer messaged me stating that the household received the game but that it isn't working, and that there is a huge scratch on the disc. The buyer promises that they did nothing to the disc on their end but before I shipped it I made sure that it worked and even cleaned a small fingerprint that it had on there, there were no scratches whatsoever. Ive only ever played the game once (when i tested to see if it worked) it was an extra copy that I won from a tournament here at my university. Ive never been in a situation like this before, so im wondering what my options are? How do situations like these usually get resolved?

Firstly, I am an extremely low volume hobby seller. Yesterday I received an email informing me that I had sold an item. Yay. It was a legit email from the ebay system. However, there was no follow up Paypal ""ship now"" email. I then check my ebay selling/sold page, and I see that someone did purchase an item.

The item has a ""sale date"", but ALL of the icons are grey in colour - shopping cart, dollar sign, package, feedback star, and envelope star. Normally, the Shopping cart icon is solid black (in the US) or blue elsewhere. I then moused over the shopping cart icon and it reads ""Checkout not complete"". It's been over 24 hours since the ""purchase"" and clearly the buyer is not going to finish the purchase and pay (item was around $10). I have a few questions:

1. How it is possible for the item to be in it's current state? It's sold, but the check out is incomplete.

I had a buyer refuse shipment then start a dispute with PayPal (they bypassed eBay all together).

This smelled funny, I mean if he shipped it with tracking why not provide the #? Why send me a message telling me you are going to do something that takes two seconds to do online. I messaged him back asking for the tracking number. His response:

&gt; i contacted ups about your package. they are tracing it to try and find where it is , I should have an answer by the end of the week

&gt; ups lost the package . I put a claim in. If you request a refund ill process it for you

He ended the relisted auction, ignored all my questions, and rather than just issuing me a refund, he tells me to request one. I messaged him back saying I would like a refund and opened a case. Somehow he went from responding immediately to my questions to not responding in 3 days.

Ebay,Buyer may be trying to scam me out of a gaming computer,"Hello all, I recently sold a gaming computer on eBay for around $311. I shipped the computer via FedEx with insurance on it for $311.

I have already contacted eBay and the lady was very kind and said she would send him an email regarding the return.

Ebay,Purchase with eBay Bucks improperly applied...,"I got $9 in eBay Bucks yesterday and, knowing they were coming and only last a month, I purchased 3 items in the amount of $4, $4, and $3.  All buy-it-now, all free shipping, all added to cart and checked out at the same time in one combined order.

eBay said it would take the entire $9 certificate and charge $2 to my Paypal account.  After the order, however, it charged each of the $4 transactions to Paypal directly and removed $3.50 from my certificate.  

Not only was I overcharged $0.50 in total, but my certificate wasn't fully used (and I have no other purchases that I wanted to use it on before it expired), and my paypal account was overcharged by $6.

I called support on the phone and they looked at my account and said it was very strange.  They also told me that the $3 item seller had not received the money yet.  They told me I could cancel the items from all the sellers, they'd reissue the certificate, and I could try to repurchase them.  However before I could do that, both of the $4 items had shipped.  

Today, in my eBay summary page both the $4 items show up, but the $3 item is not there and is, in fact, in my cart as if I had never bought it.  The only record of me purchasing the $3 item is on my order details.  That page lists all 3 items as well as the fact that the subtotal was $11, a $9 coupon was applied, but then for some reason it says the total is -$4.  It also does say that the $3 item seller has not received money for the purchase.  Lastly, nowhere on the website is my eBay Bucks certificate -- in part or in whole.

Ebay,Just a small observation/rant on my experience.,"I am a very small time seller on eBay. I've been flipping miscellaneous stuff, or selling stuff around the house, for 10+ years. I have barely 100 feedback, but it's 100%.

I rarely buy on ebay. I just don't think of it as the first place when I want something. However, I've purchased a few things here and there. I've had 2 issues with purchases, both from high volume, top rated sellers. I purchased a DVD, and the seller shipped it in a plastic envelope. It provided no protection and the DVD case was broken during shipping. It was more painful than it needed to be to get a refund. I recently purchased a $200 Target gift card for $185. It was one of eBay's daily deals. The gift card arrived empty. I didn't know until I tried to use it online. I contacted the seller. They tell me that they contacted Target and said I used the card. I contacted Target myself, and they told me that the card was never activated. I had to raise the dispute to eBay to get a refund.

Ebay,Package Dimensions and Pricing,"I'm incredibly new to the selling aspect of Ebay, as well as shipping anything other than a standard letter. When listing an item, there's the package options near the end that asks for dimensions and weight. I don't currently have the boxes I'm going to ship the items in as I was going to pick them up later this week, so I was wondering just how specific those dimensions had to be.  
How strict are carriers usually when it comes down to stuff like that? If my package is an inch larger in one dimension than I listed it for, will it possibly be denied and returned to me? For what it's worth, I'm shipping through the USPS.",12,2,2016-01-06,EBAY,0.01605837047100067,0.9117320775985718,0.07220955938100815
Ebay,How Does This Work? How Does the Seller Make Money?,"I apologize for the vague title, I have a bunch of questions and ideas that I couldn't fit there.

I was looking to buy a certain item and had checked all over the internet to see where I can get the best price for it.  It turned out that eBay had the best price.  The MSRP on the item is $499.99, Amazon had it for $377.99, and the going price on eBay for a new one was $295.00.

I continued to look around other sites for a few days (while waiting for bills to clear), and when I finally decided to buy from eBay, the price had went up.  I submitted a best offer on an item (seller had it for $312.99 BIN OBO, free shipping) for $295.00.  The seller countered with $310.00.  I bid on a couple other ones knowing that they'd end before the offer expired, and lost both of them, with the final selling prices higher than $310.  So, I accepted the offer, and the seller shipped right away.  I thought the tracking number looked funny even though the seller selected USPS as the shipping method when submitting the tracking number to eBay.

That evening, I received the item.  I was surprised.  It was sent same day shipping via Amazon Logistics.

How did the seller do that?  If he simply drop shipped via an Amazon order, how does the seller make money in this case?  Amazon was selling them at $377.99, and same day shipping probably cost him another $10-20.  He'd be losing $70-80 on the sale.  Perhaps he was trying to cash out an Amazon gift card?  If so, then why would he go through the trouble of eBaying it and losing so much of the value instead of just outright selling it?  The seller had two of the item available according to the eBay listing.

The item by the way, arrived fine, brand new as described, but did not contain any sort of invoices or receipts that usually accompany Amazon orders.

This one has me scratching my head!",6,2,2016-01-06,EBAY,0.07264178991317749,0.893536388874054,0.03382185101509094

Ebay,Seller Requesting More Funds after Shipping the Item,"So I recently made a computer purchase through ebay. It was Sunday afternoon when the auctioned ended and I was the highest bidder. Sweet! Day is enhanced because I won and people love winning and material objects. Moving on. 

Fast forward Tuesday afternoon. I ask the seller about the shipping and when he/she plans to send it off. I get a response saying they will do it before the end of the day. Another sweet moment. 

No we are present time. Wednesday morning rolls around and I receive a message from the seller requesting that I send an additional 40$ to cover additional, unforeseen shipping charges. The original listing was 20$ and that shipping fee was for FedEx's standard ground shipping. Now the seller listed the shipping as standard ground shipping that will take up to 5-7 (this is accurate to the post) days but now telling me that I owe more money due to the shipping cost being $60.53. Even after calculating the cost on the FedEx website with all the box dimensions and weight and with the appropriate service I get $39.46. 

Seems like a lot of people through the Ebay website are cut throat and just want to leave negative reviews and shit on the seller when this happens. I get that unforeseen charges occur and it is sometimes unavoidable.
But is it the fault of the seller for not calculating correctly and doing their homework or is it the responsibility (even when the seller is in the wrong-meaning that after the agreements have been met and payment received, the seller alters the terms of agreements ie. requesting more money) of the buyer to cover the additional cost?

What does everyone think?

My conclusion at this point is asking to see a receipt with the price or just waiting for the package to arrive and checking out the price then before throwing $40 dollars to this seller or hastily being a prick. But nonetheless, any stories or relevant info for handling this would be desired and welcomed!

Ebay,Seller here. I'm hoping you guys can help walk me through an iPhone 6 Plus potential return so I do not make any mistakes. (Long),"I've read the horror stories so I'm a little leery of this. I sell on eBay fairly regularly and have processed returns in the past as I do offer a 14 day return policy with a 15% restocking fee for most items. 

On the 4th I sold an iPhone 6 Plus via best offer. There were 2 people with offers so I chose the person with a higher rating. The person I sold it to also sells about the same amount I do with a 1500+ rating so I was thinking that was a good pick.

I did a chat with AT&amp;T to verify the IMEI and saved that transcript. I then video taped the packaging process getting a clear view of the serial info all the way to drop off at the post office where I got a receipt for the drop off. I had printed the label through eBay and included full insurance and delivery confirmation.

Fast forward to today when the phone is scheduled for delivery I received the following message:

""I haven't actually received this yet but I need to return it. When I was searching it came up in the searches with the 6 S and I didn't notice that it was a 6 Plus until I was looking at delivery confirmation. I'm sorry the search brought it up that way. I won't even open it so there is no concern with whether or not I did any damage to it. I will just send it back as soon as it arrives. Sorry for the confusion.""

To note this is the listing title: ""Apple iPhone 6 Plus 16GB Gold AT&amp;T Smartphone Cell Phone Sim Included Bundled."" The title is also in the description as the title there.

Further, I double checked the model number it was listed under and it was iPhone 6 Plus.

I'm thinking this is buyers remorse as they should know how to use eBay at this point (1500 buyer feedback 780 seller feedback).

Anyway, I do offer returns within 14 days with a 15% restocking fee and buyer pays return shipping. These are all selected in my generic eBay return policy. This is my specific return policy:

*seller store*

Does that look ok? Normally I would send a more personal response with this information, but I know the iPhone 6 has a higher scam potential and I don't want to make any mistakes. 

Further, I just thought of this. Can they register it and then send it back then try to claim it is stolen or anything? I suppose I can do another chat with AT&amp;T to ask this question.

Thank you guys for your help. 

TL;DR - Sold an iPhone 6 Plus. Buyer claims they thought it was a 6S. Wants to return it. I do have a return policy but I don't want to get scammed.

Ebay,Received Counterfeit off of eBay,"Hi everyone,

I bought an item off of eBay and received a counterfeit item. I first asked the seller for a return and they refused to pay return shipping, so therefore I escalated to eBay customer support. At first the service rep said they will inform the seller to pay return postage and resolve the case, but then they asked me to prove that it's counterfeit. (this took some time) but I got a message from customer service of the manufacturer which I submitted to prove that it was counterfeit. However, eBay ruled in the sellers favor because it took to much time. Then I started a chargeback with my credit card issuer, who also ruled in the seller's favor because the message from the manufacturer wasn't enough, they require a full on letter with their letterhead. 

At this point, is there anything I can do to get my money back? Or am I out of luck?",17,2,2016-01-08,EBAY,0.04229143634438515,0.9177845120429993,0.03992404788732529

Ebay,Paypal check bounced and no buyer response,"Hi all, my father recently sold a phone on ebay for $570 and thought he had received the payment 3 days later.

Now here's the problem. My father is not too familiar with ebay (admittedly neither am I) and somehow he let the deadline to open a claim go by (by only 1 day...).

Ebay,Ebay store or regular listings?,"Hello all,

Ebay seller here for many years with a standard account (not an ebay store).  I've always used this account to list mostly personal items, but over past 1.5 years I've been using this account to also list between 500-1000 items a month which are related to my business.

Obviously the fees get crazy listing this volume of items using a standard account.  The .30 insertion fees alone can push $300 a month, and of course the final value fees are significantly higher than that.  I've been very reluctant to move over to an eBay store for a few reasons, primarily due to not being found with as much priority in search results.

So I do have a few questions to the good folks here on the /r/Ebay subreddit that I'm hoping I can get some clarification on:

- If listing your items in an Ebay store (and not a regular auction or fixed price listing), do your listings in fact come up in search results with lower priority?  Meaning, after all auctions and fixed price listings which match the search term, then way down at the bottom of these results your Ebay store listings would be found?
- In order to easily manipulate the volume of listings we work with, I depend heavily on TurboLister.  Can you still use the TurboLister software to list/modify your listings if these were done through an Ebay store?
- I also have some custom development in place where Ebay will send an XML file notifications upon both bids and completed sales.  These XML files are then parsed by scripts on my server, and imported into a database and a series of profit/loss spreadsheets.  Moving over to an Ebay store may break this entire functionality with the XML files being pushed... not entirely sure.
- And I guess overall one of the biggest questions would be... what would we actually stand to save by moving over to an Ebay store vs standard listings?

Our entire sales operation is primarily done through our own website.  Ebay accounts for new customer acquisition, and maybe 15% of our overall sales.  Fees are crazy, but we've continued with Ebay simply for that new customer acquisition which is very important to us.

Any response on these items would be greatly appreciated!",8,4,2016-01-11,EBAY,0.05010891333222389,0.9028124213218689,0.04707862436771393

Ebay,"Bought a book with a coupon. Was described as good, solid condition, but has arrived in poor condition and badly packaged. Should I/Can I ask for a partial refund?","I got a coupon that expired on December 28th, and it had to be spent in a single transaction. So, I bought this cool old astronomy book, which was described as in ""good condition"" and ""solid."" Got home today and found the package waiting, but my heart kind of sank when i picked it up. This is a hundred year old book sent in a thin, manila, bubble envelope that was way too big for the book and had zero other packing material inside. Having sold a few antique books myself, the packing job was a bad omen, but I decided to brush it off and hold out hope.

Well, the book wasn't much better. It *is* pretty and interesting. However, it was not in good condition. The spine is completely separated. The text block is loose - thankfully not loose enough that any of the signatures or pages are falling out, but it feels pretty close to that state. Also, the book is ex-library, which was not mentioned anywhere in the description or pictures. There's a library sticker on the spine, large library stamps inside the front cover, and a library card pocket inside the back cover.

So, I'm kind of torn on what to do here. It was essentially free for me, and I like the book, but I feel like I traded in a free $50 bill for $10. There were other items I would have bought instead if I knew the condition this book would arrive in. Also, the seller seems to sell only books, so I feel like they should know to list something as ex-library, describe the *real* condition, and make sure to pack everything snugly. Basically:

**Tl;dr** I'd like to keep the book. So, is it possible to get a partial refund on a coupon, and how would I go about that? Thanks.",10,3,2016-01-12,EBAY,0.021813351660966873,0.9281325936317444,0.05005411058664322

Ebay,Interesting one...do you think Ebay will remove this defect?,"I sold a facial cleaner to a buyer.  I have a 14 day return policy, the buyer started a return request within the 14 days.  She states the item does not turn on, despite her charging it fully.  The item also comes with a gel.  She admits to using the gel.  But that's no problem, I know the item doesn't work, and she shouldn't be stuck with it - I will accept the return and refund her.      

What's funny is...she actually offered to pay for the return shipping.  I gave her two options: 1.  Return the item to me, once I receive, I will refund in full.  2.  I give her a partial refund now...basically a full refund minus shipping costs.      

So I have two questions:  

1.  Can I accept her offer for her to pay her own shipping if she does return it?  Or does Ebay frown on that?
2.  I will refund her no matter what options she chooses.  I sell enough volume, she shouldn't be stuck with a non-functional product.  However, I really don't want the defect - will Ebay remove the defect for me, since she used the gel and now the item is no longer in the same condition as received?  Will me accepting her to pay for the shipping affect any chance I get of calling Ebay and getting the defect removed?  The reason I am so adament about getting the defect removed, is this defect will push me out of top seller....again.  Dammit.

Ebay,"Return dispute for item, user claims item has no warranty and is damaged.","Having an issue with a buyer who is saying that the GoPro I sold him didn't come with the warranty as I described.

The buyer had raised this with him at 11:26 this morning after the delivery had been confirmed at 11:11.

The product had 6 months warranty remaining and still does, I gave him instructions on how to get the serial number from the camera and check it with GoPro whilst also linking to their warranty page to confirm.

I also sent a picture of my original receipt of the product to confirm it's purchase date, I offered to drive it to him (as he was 20 mins away) if he required it urgently.

The buyer then responded saying it was too late and they didn't have time and have arranged to get another as he is no longer in Birmingham?

I fail to understand how he is able to say in such quick succession of the delivery time 11:11 a confirmed by the courier that he is no longer in Birmingham? Surely he has to be at that address to receive the item?

5 hours later in the same return case, he/she then comes out of the blue and says the camera has damage to the screen? Surely if you are buying a GoPro, the first thing you are going to do is check the GoPro? So I don't understand how it's taken 5 hours to raise this.

The buyer has then uploaded several pictures of the item of which on one of them I notice that it shows the camera in it's case with NO damage to the screen. I quickly download the images he has placed on there and show a comparison and upload it back to ebay..

I then contacted telephone support but was told because the other account was so old it had been archived and they were unable to see the reason why it has been blocked and that it was therefore impossible to reverse the suspension on the new account.

Ebay,What should I do if a seller is claiming a fake item is real? UK,"I bought some Vans from a seller as a gift for my brother only to find out they were fake after he looked at them. I contacted Vans, sent them pictures of the shoes, and they got back to me telling me they were definitely fake (because of the stitching, logo, general quality of the shoes, etc).

I pressed and said I'd like to return them and they told me 'Only with the tag. Other wise no dice. Game over. I wanna return them myself and get the money back cause I bought them from a good store.'

Sadly, I no longer have the tag, as I took it off due to it showing a price. At this point, am I basically stuck because I no longer have the tag?

Ebay,Return requested stating 'does not match desciption',"I recently sold my old OnePlus One mobile phone on eBay, it went for less than I wanted, probably due to now using my own account (with a low amount of feedback), when historically I have always used a family member who had a high feedback rating.

Anyway, after a few days the seller filed a claim saying it didn't match the description as the OS was different to what he's used previously. I've tried explaining that it's a software update, but he's not having any of it... the device is in perfect condition, and is just on the latest version of Cyanogen.

I know eBay always seems to side with the buyer, but I really don't want to have to spend another $15 on postage to get it returned, then have to sell it *again* and spend another $15 on postage, totally $45 in total... cutting deep into my profits, and time.

The only reason I rarely use eBay is due to the time involvement, now this has put me right off.

Ebay,New Shipping Prices? Buyer paid last night and I printed labels this morning and prices were different!,"This is kindof an FYI and kid of a rant. Last night I sold items to three different people. Two paid last night and when I went to go print their shipping labels (around 10 pm Central), eBay said that printing labels was down and try again at 11:01 Pacific time. So, I just went to bed and would try printing labels again in the morning.

This morning I go to print labels (by now, all three buyers had paid) and I'm noticing that the shipping calculated is different than what they paid (i.e. they paid $5.75 and the shipping is now $6.10) and I'm confused because I know I calculated the price for them last night.

And then I remembered that the cost of shipping was changing this month, and lo and behold the new prices went into effect today! So three people paid for the old shipping cost and for each of them I had to pay for the new shipping cost! I mean, it's only like a dollar difference, so I'm not too beat up about it, but still!

Ebay,"Received a ""Received in Damaged Condition"" item back.","Sold a pair of tennis shoes early in January. They came back on Friday and I just sent a message to the buyer asking if they would like me to re-send them or refund their purchase. I haven't heard from them at all yet. No note about ""where are my shoes?"" or ""they arrived in damaged condition"". Ok. A little odd but everyone is busy right?

Once I opened the box and took out the shoes I noticed the laces on the right shoe were very much loosened, like you would do when you try on a pair of shoes. Inside the shoe there is actually a bunch of pet hair? transfer from their sock. Looking closer at the box there is a second piece of tape placed over my tape. The second piece of tape does not have the same teeth cut as my dispenser at all. The box was opened from the bottom to avoid cutting any labels.

So they got the shoes. Tried them on, at least one, and decided they did not want them for whatever reason. Put them back. Taped the box. Punched a hole on the side of the box. Dropped them off at the post office and claimed ""Received Damaged"" to avoid paying the $15.50 return shipping. Amazing.

$10 says they do not want me to resend them the shoes because they ""will not be here in time"" or ""bought another pair"".

Ebay,USPS Rate increase specific to First Class International Packages?,"Okay, I thought I had a handle on the new rate increases. Revised everything yesterday based on the advertised 21% increase on First Class International. Never could find a new rate table for FCI for 2016. 

For a 2 oz box shipped FCI Stamps.com is showing a rate of $12.xx. It used to be $6.xx. After a bit of confusion (because that's helluva rate increase) I determined that everything between 1 and 8 oz gets the rate for 8 oz. 

Wut?

Is this new -- a ""minimum"" weight for 8 oz for FCI packages? Or is Stamps.com being stupid? (They used to default to 2 oz when there were lower rates for 1 oz, but it was a moot point for me because I don't think I've ever shipped a box that weighed less than an ounce.) 

USPS website and eBay's postage calculator and assorted other sites still have the old rate tables, and I can't find a rate table ANYWHERE that shows the 1/19 FCI rates.

Ebay,"Frustrating sale, how would you proceed, I just got a message from a seller I sold a mug to over a month ago.","So, a few weeks before Christmas, I sold a mug for $14 with shipping included.  I buy lots of mugs then list them in batches, so I had this mug, and it ended up being worth less than I expected, but I had arleady taken pictures of it, and was listing them so at that point even with a small profit, I was at the point where it was worth it to just list it though.


So I get a message from this guy on a saturday asking if i could get the mug to him by Monday, and I told him it was pretty much impossible, unless he paid for express which would be 40 bucks or so.  Then Monday night he orders it, then I get a message Tuesday morning, saying not to send it unless I can get it to him by Friday, I tell him its likely I can get it there by Friday, I shipped out 12 things 11 of them get there by Friday, his item goes completely off of tracking and disappears until Monday when its delivered.  

In the meantime I get multiple messages from him every day, on Friday, he tells me that he is moving that day, and if he doesn't get the mug he won't be able to receive it, I tell him he should have his mail forwarded to his new address.  He asks me if I can intercept his package and have it forwarded to his new address.  I tell him that that's not really an option.  Somehow, he has a friend get it for him and he ends up getting it.

Now a month later I get a message from him about how disappointed he was in my service and the transaction.  How should I respond.  I hate that I've spent so much time on some thing that in the end I probably profited 4 bucks on.  Any ideas what to do with this?  

Oh, another annoyance I forgot, was having them send messages, before the item was expected to be delivered in the morning, then that afternoon sending even more irate messages that I haven't gotten back to them about their earlier message from a few hours earlier.

Ebay,Preserving TRS status with impending 4th cancelled order... Any way around this?,"Hey everyone,

I've been a little too sloppy regarding keeping my inventory updated in turbolister. I've cancelled 1 order for an unknown reason and cancelled 2 more because I forgot to update turbolister, then sold an item I no longer had. It happened again yesterday, which would make this order the 4th order I've cancelled, and means I would lose my Top-Rated Seller status.

Is there any way around this? I've thought of sending a message to the buyer, notifying him that I no longer have the shirt, but that I would be willing to send him another shirt of the same size for just the cost of shipping, or if he would like he may request to cancel the order. I'm not sure this would work, though, as I've never done this and eBay seems to only allow buyers to request to cancel an order within the first hour of purchasing.

I've also thought of ""marking the item as shipped,"" then taking the hit on an item not received case, refunding the buyer, and being docked by eBay for not uploading tracking in time (rather than a cancelled order).

On a side note, I have an older cancelled order, from Jan 13, 2015 that is currently counted against me.

They just purchased more stuff today(their name is very memorable) so I looked it up and it's the same buyer as before, same home address, 2 different purchases, two different paypal emails on the account(nothing like the email he is using for eBay). So I assume hacked accounts again.

Hello,
I m in the process of becoming a makeup artistAnd I am starting from scratch and was wondering if you have any over stock items you could donate (2/2) I'm wanting to try all the different makeup brands and I'm open to anything
Thank you ,


then today, there is another message from another buyer.

I have 200+ items on sale there, and I have two accounts one message was sent to one account the other message was sent to my other account , so I doubt that these two are the same person

here is the copy of that message:


Hello kind ma'am or sir,

Is there any way you can donate a few pieces to me. I am a single mother with a newborn son , twin one yr olds, a two year old and a 14 yr old girl. her birthday is next week I have no money. I just got laied off and im trying to jet a job but I dont have anything and I am trying to get her something , anything. She told me all she wants is makeup , perfume,and something to put make up in .She wants to become a makeup artist and im trying to find some she can practice with .I will pay it forward anyway I can. I will be forever greatful. Thank you so much have a blessed day.


on the top of the second message, it mentioned the other user's name so this person is copying and pasting the message to several users.


is this a new trend? I have never received such message but this is the second one in three weeks.

I mean, this is a business I run and I work hard for it. I run it with intention of making profits, I am not just getting rid of items that I no longer need for a fraction of what i paid.

Ebay,"I think I'm being scammed, anything I can do?","Hello all! Thanks for reading if you do! So the other day I bought an item (N3DSXL) for a great price! I don't know why I was so amateurish about this, because I've done this before but I can make excuses all day either way I MESSED UP. Seller is a month old, 1 rating (it's good), unverified PayPal, and stock image. After I bought the item (sent a best offer, it was accepted) I messaged him (too late) and asked for a couple pics of the item. He said he couldn't because he would be buying the item online and have it sent to me. This was SO SKETCHY. I asked for an update today, and haven't heard back. I just know I'm getting scammed, but the est. delivery date is Jan 28th, so eBay says to wait until then. 

Does anyone have advice on what I should do? I know I messed up, really really dumb decision on my part to buy from this guy, but I'm stuck where I am. Do I just have to wait until the 28th and start working from there? 

Thanks for any advice in advance!

Ebay,"The buyer wants to find an ""amiable solution"" but I feel I've done enough...","In mid November I sold an electronic item to a buyer.  Due to the holiday season the package took 7 business days to arrive.  I uploaded a tracking when I shipped, but the buyer messaged me inquiring about updates.  He was polite and I felt bad due to the holiday season, so I sent him free attachments for the device as a thank you for him being patient (basically ate all my profits).  The device got delivered in early December and he got the free accessories (which he likes) a few days afterwards.  He left a great feedback.       

Forward to a few days ago, and he said that he bought the device as a gift for a family member in Russia.  He sent it there by post, and now the person in Russia said the device worked the first time but is now no longer holding a charge.  He has asked what he should do next.  We have many messages exchanges, and he was polite the entire time.      

I went through some forums to see if I could find a reason why it wouldn't charge.  I offered some advice but it didn't work.  The device still won't hold a charge.  I told him there's nothing I can do, that the device worked when he first got it.  I have a 14 day return policy, but it's now been more than 60 days since he first bought the item, and more than 40 days since the item was delivered.       

I tried to explain that I've been nice and sent him extras because the item was delivered late, and that even a retail store such as Macy's won't accept a return after 30 days.  How can he expect me, a small online seller to accept a return this long after the sale?         

He said he would call Ebay customer service.  They told him to open a return case.  He said he won't do that, as he feels he's already past the 30 day return window and it would just be a waste of his time.  However, he still wants to find an ""amiable"" way to settle the dispute.  The manufactuer also won't repair the item for him.  I figure if he does open a case, it will be decided in my favor.  Yet he still wants to find an ""amiable solution.""       

He asked me if I had the same item for sale, and if I would be willing to ship to Russia.  I promptly blocked him as a buyer after that.  As I didnt' want to be scammed into sending something working and have them send the broken device back.      

Tell me fellow sellers...am I being too harsh here?  I feel like I've done enough.  I've told him several times now, I am sorry, there's nothing else I can do.

Ebay,"Seller shipped item in the wrong type of packaging, cost me an additional $20 to pick it up","I won an auction for an item on December 31st. The seller was on vacation but didn't have his status set to away, and I didn't get a reply from him till 5 days later on Jan 5th. Understandable. He apologized, albeit nonchalantly. He printed his own priority 2-day shipping label on the 7th and didn't ship out till the 11th. The estimated arrival date range listed on the auction was the 3rd through the 9th. The item finally made it to my city on the 13th, but a signature was required for delivery and I was at work. Fearing I would be gone again if I attempted to reschedule a delivery date, I decided to just go pick it up at the post office when I had the time. 

Today I took the pink slip of paper they left to the post office to pick it up. Apparently the seller used an overnight envelope instead of the proper priority 2-day packaging, and it was marked as ""postage due"". So, in addition to the $6.15 I had already paid for shipping, I had to pay $20.60 just to pick the item up. I sent a message with pics of proof to the seller about an hour ago explaining what happened and politely asking him to PayPal me the $20.60 (he hasn't responded yet). No idea how this guy has 100% positive feedback with only 3 neutral ratings. 

Since the item itself was $15, plus the agreed upon $6.15 shipping, I can bet he'll be apprehensive about immediately reimbursing me the $20.60. So my question is, what course of action can I take with eBay if he tries to dodge responsibility and refuses to reimburse me this outrageous bonus shipping charge? I've never had anything like this happen to me before and I've been using eBay to buy and sell, but mostly buy, for over 10 years. But this is undeniably his fault, and there's no way I'm going to eat the $20 and end up paying $40 for this item.

Ebay,Received payment for item but ebay has no record of a sale.,"I sold a circuit board on ebay last night.

Not long after, a second payment came in from another customer.  But no emails from ebay followed.  Smelling something fishy I checked ebay and there was only the one earlier sale listed on my dashboard, and no returns.  Checking Paypal, the payment was there, so this isn't a case of someone somehow faking a Paypal email with the correct description for an ebay item.   I think....

The first customer was in the US, the second in Spain, and they were hours apart, so its clearly not the same guy somehow paying twice.  I also sell items overseas quite a bit so that's not unusual either.

If it's a legit sale then ebay's clearly screwed something up.  

But it also seems like it could also be someone who somehow manipulated paypal to make it appear they purchased an item from ebay for some nefarious purpose.  Perhaps they plan to reques a refund from Paypal and hope that when Paypal requests verification of the sale from ebay they'll find no sale has occurred or something and grant the refund despite the item being delivered?

Ebay,Question about declining a return request for a two month old sale,"Hi There,

I sold someone a brand new Nexus 6 phone on November 30. He asked for rush shipping, and i decided to be generous and upgrade him to overnight shipping. It shipped via USPS Express mail with insurance. Just today, I received a return request because he's having some kind of issue with the device... Maybe he is. Maybe he isn't. Not my call to make.

The phone is under warranty, and Motorola has a replacement program, if there truly is an issue. I now have like negative $300 in my PayPal account When I go to resolve the issue on eBay, I see that I can accept the return, issue a refund / partial refund, send hi a message, or decline the return.

I want to do the right thing, and I want to not lose money. I've had some bad experiences like ten years ago with Paypal chargebacks, and I know they rarely side with the seller. Here is what I would LIKE to do. Tell me if this is smart or if there are potential downsides to this approach. I'd like to send him a message, tell him that I can't accept returns, but that Motorola has a great warranty program where they will send him a new phone before he even sends the old one back. I'll give him a link to that. Then I'll decline the return. I believe this is the ethical thing to do.

Ebay,"[Rant] Please don't advertise ""one day handling"" if you don't plan on shipping it in ONE day.","Sorry I'm just a little frustrated right now.  Let me explain...

I run a fairly small, but profitable eBay store.  I don't sell a very large amount of items, but I take pride in the items I sell, and my customer's satisfaction.  I offer same day shipping because I believe in this day and age, same day or 1-day shipping should be expected.

That being said, I am also a very active buyer on eBay!  eBay is an awesome marketplace with some great deals; however I still find myself being frustrated constantly.  I am leaving for a trip in 3 days and this trip requires me to have some winter attire.  About a week ago I purchased a SWEET Patagonia Jacket for a very reasonable price.  I knew I needed the jacket soon, so I ended up spending a few dollars more, just because I wanted to buy from someone who offered ""Next day shipping"".  I made my purchase and didn't think much of it.

Over the past seven days I have been messaging the seller and I just received a reply TODAY saying, ""Hi there :), thank you for your patience.  Your package will be shipped out tomorrow.  Thank you for your business.""  Needless to say I am a little upset.

For any eBayers who may read this (especially if you are new to eBay), please just be honest with yourself.  If you can't ship items on a regular basis, THAT'S OKAY!  Just be sure to describe your shipping methods in the description and accurately mark your ""handling time"".  If for some reason you won't be able to ship an item for an extended period of time, then 1.  You should make this known to eBay  2.  You should message the buyer immediately after they purchase an item.

Also, I had a case decided against me (seller) by PayPal and they gave a refund to the buyer even though he returned the package to the wrong address.","This has been quite the saga but I'll try to keep it short: I sold an item in late December, the buyer received the item and said it didn't work. (of course, it was tested before I sent it out.) In his first email to me he said that he had taken off the cover and replaced it with the one from his old machine. I asked for some guidance from eBay about this and they said that since he had modified the item then if he were to open a case they would decide in my favor. Because of this I told him I would not give him a refund.

So he then opens a case with PayPal. PayPal initially was in agreement with eBay's policies but ultimately decided against me. They told me he had 10 days to return the item to me. A few days later I received a tracking number and a few days after that I check tracking and it says ""delivered"" but to a zip code that is not mine.

Now I'm dealing with USPS and they say that the package was addressed to the wrong place (very similar street names Street vs Avenue) but I'm still working with them to get the package. PayPal told me today that they have a policy that sounds crazy but is something like ""if it shows delivered within 10 miles then that's good enough for us."" 

But PayPal has issued the refund because the tracking says ""delivered"" even though it shows that it was delivered to the wrong zip code. The buyer did not get full purchase price insurance on the package and now it looks like it was lost.

So I'm out $165 for the sale price $22 for the shipping they paid (actual shipping was over $30), eBay fees, and my merchandise. It just seems really crazy and frustrating. And all along I'm getting mixed messages from PayPal. What can I do besides not sell on eBay?

The clerk had no idea that the limit had gone up for commercial customers to 16 ounces and it caused a minor furor at the Post Office with the local Postmaster becoming involved and telling the clerks about the change.  The clerks told me they had no training or information on the change.

Also it appears that the big Priority Regional Rate Box C is no longer a Regional Rate Box, just a Large Mailing Box.  This being said the clerks think it is no larger a valid PM box...at least at my PO.  For now, until they are trained, I am either turning them inside out or covering up the Regional Rate Box C printing on these boxes to avert problems at the counter.",11,4,2016-01-22,EBAY,0.05908385291695595,0.9010041356086731,0.039912059903144836
Ebay,Question on unpaid item case.,"I had a listing for an item without international shipping, the bid ends and the winner sends me an invoice request with a message saying, ""Would you be willing to ship to India?"" I tell him sure (since he had already won the auction), and send him the shipping invoice for $22.00. He sends me a message saying ""That's more than I wanted to pay. I thought it would be no more than $14.00."" I then offer to pay the $8.00 difference. He then shoots back with, ""Will you send pictures of the (item's) screen to my personal email?"" I already had photos of the screen showing the flaws that I had also described in the listing, so I tell him the pictures he's requesting are in the listing. He comes back with, ""I can't clearly see the pictures. I don't want the screen going out on me!""

After calling Ebay support and them telling me my options, (pretty much canceling or opening a case), I open an unpaid item case. The buyer messages me saying ""Next time include pictures when asked, an unpaid item case won't bother me!""

Will the case help me in any way? I know Ebay can kind of screw the seller with all the buyer protection stuff.

I just found it unfair that he can buy the item knowing I wasn't offering international shipping, then refuse to pay because the price is too high, then again refuse to pay after I offered to meet his needs on the price, and then use the excuse that I wouldn't provide pictures he already had access to get me to cancel the order. He had plenty of time in the 10 day auction to send me a question. He shouldn't have bought it if he had so many unanswered questions.

Ebay,"Seller keeps delaying shipping, can I do anything?","What are my options, what if they just keep telling me they will ship?

I ordered something with best offer on Monday.  I paid immediately.  The auction says 3 business days to ship.  I emailed Wednesday to ask for tracking.

It didn't get shipped on Friday and she said she would ship first thing this morning and send me the tracking.  I still haven't heard anything from the seller regarding the tracking.  I really want the item (it's more than 300 dollars) but she says I'd have to pay for expedited shipping if I want it to arrive definitely on time.  I said to just ship priority as that's what I paid for today and we'd hope it arrived on time.  I'm worried she didn't ship today since I haven't heard anything from her.

Ebay,Am I about to be scammed out of my money?,"Hi all,
Selling a product on ebay that is really just a redemption code in a box. I bought it originally, not remembering that I had bought it previously. So when I tried to redeem the code it told me I already had redeemed a similar code.

So I'm selling the product on Ebay, and I mentioned in the listing, if it gives the buyer more confidence, once they pay I'll send them the code digitally then ship them the box (not sure why I did that).

Had a buyer contact me yesterday saying:
I am the highest bidder on the item. If I win the item as mentioned on your listing will you please share the code before you ship the item? Also can you just send normal shipping with tracking instead of priority I don't want to spend more money just for shipping if this is ok with you. 

It's been years since I've sold something on Ebay. Am I opening myself up for being scammed if I go along with his request?

Ebay,Please help. :( I am a seller who is being scammed out of $900,"**Update:** I have called ebay about the situation. They assured me I wouldn't have to refund unless he returned the item.  I felt safe calling them since it's past the 45 buyer guarantee window. Unsure if I should pre-emptively call PAYPAL as well, since it's under the 180 day timeframe and he hasn't yet filed a claim. I worry that if I do, paypal may contact him, and he may not have even been aware of paypal being an option for himself as he messaged me saying he'd call ebay with no mention of paypal.

&amp;nbsp;

Hi, I'm a relatively new ebayer. I recently sold a piece of DJ equipment that's very expensive for about **$900** after shipping. It had left my hands in perfectly working conditions with 0 history of any issues. There was also a few pictures in my listing of the dj deck turned on and shown working. What I sold was actually one of a pair, and the other one of the pair I sold has had 0 complaints from a different person who purchased it.

&amp;nbsp;

**3 weeks after my item was delivered to the buyer, they claimed it won't turn on**. They said it was completely damaged internal components (so no photographic proof). 

&amp;nbsp;

I package my items well previously working at a post office so I start an insurance claim. The person emails me back and forth but ALWAYS **dodges my direct requests for: pictures, an official quote of the damage and repair cost estimate, etc.** *(all they provided was the serial number which does match).*

&amp;nbsp;

**It's now 2 months since it was delivered** and they have not cooperated with the Post Office who sent them an email package to report the alleged damage. (By the way believe me if it was possible for me to do all the work without him for the claim I would but the post office MUST get confirmation from the receiver in order to process anything).


Anyways NOW the buyer is saying they don't believe me that it was damaged in the shipping and that they're contacting ebay tomorrow. I swear to god on everything I am telling the truth that when I sent it, it was working 100% there really is no other explanation other than shipping damage OR buyer damage.

&amp;nbsp;

**Please advise me what to do I'm so worried because it's so much money for me. :( They paid by paypal so even though ebay SNAD window is over (45 days) they still are within paypal's 180 days!!!!!

Ebay,eBay asking for all account info + SSN...is this new?,"Hello /r/eBay!  

I have been trying to go on eBay for the last few weeks, and every time I try to go on the front page (just ebay.com) it asks for my sign in, address/name, etc, and a credit card, SSN, and info of that like.  

Now, having been on the internet for more than a minute, this raises all sorts of red flags for me. Why is eBay asking for all this info when I already have an account? Why WOULD I be entering this info? Is this some new policy set since they split PayPal off, or is this some kind of phishing thing like I think it is?  

I tried finding info on this other places, but nothing comes up. If anyone knows anything about this, I would much appreciate it.  



EDIT: It looks like I had a deeper issue with my network that was mostly hidden from my eye that was causing this. Somehow my network was tapped into and the DNS was changed to some Norwegian DNS provider instead of the normal ISP provided one.  

I figured this out when I went to Amazon and had the same issue as eBay, only it was styled like Amazon log ins. It's a really dumb issue that I think I have fixed now that I can see both of the *normal* ebay.com and amazon.com pages. My only concern is that they both share the same IP, so I hope the issue isn't still present somewhere. Thanks for all the helpful comments, it helped me think a bit and identify the issue.  

Tips anyone else who encounters this: Check your router settings. If it is not your custom DNS, or your ISP one, search the DNS number and add the 'dns' to the query. It should help you identify what's going on.",12,4,2016-01-24,EBAY,0.033405400812625885,0.933756411075592,0.03283822908997536

Continue reading if you're bored:
&gt;I've never had many questions from buyers and the ones I had were about little details that I assumed were obvious. Nevertheless, I've edited the descriptions with added new info which already are appropriately detailed in the description. Now I got this guy/gal asking me about a brand new magazine I was selling. It's a few months old, OOP, never read and I carefully stored them after I bought them. It had a sound cover and exclusive content, so I made my bet. No creases, rips, no edge nor spine wear. They look the same as the day I took them home from the store. They don't come sealed as they don't include extras or offers nor are sensible material for under legal age people. And I pick the best ones from the shelf. I always include a couple of photos from it's inner pages and index, being careful not to bend pages, corners or create creases. Also, as I ship worldwide, I usually do two listings one for Europe/World and another one for USA/World. Prices are the same but ebay has some shipping category limits and I figured it'd be easier if I passed the shipping costs to the item price and comply with their maximum shipping price (no way on earth I'd be able to ship an almost 1kg magazine, tracked and signed, for under 15€ but ebay.com imposes a max of $6 USD!). Now, this guy/gal messaged me about a week ago (listings were still active) asking me about the condition and if they were sealed. I replied back with an extensive mini-text-wall detailing about law and distribution and how I securely pack them and how he'd be covered from any inccident during it's way. I never heard back from him until three days after, contacting me on the other listing with slightly different questions but basically asking the same (sealed, creases, rips, wtv). I had a feeling on the first time and considered not to even reply but this second question just settled my decision. I've blocked him, but before that I checked his feedback. So he has an account for a decade now, has no more than 40 feedback and seems not to shop for more than a year. 15% of the few feedback he left is neutral+negative (yeah, I did the math). The neutral one seems to be for pathetic reasons, mostly refer to the package handling by the postal service, while inner protection and items themselves were intact? A neg because package arrived with folded corners, wtf? I'm sure sellers could contest this kind of feedback, even the positive ones he seems to look for any detail he can get to frame the seller.
Anyway, the mags sold out and none to him. Still, I've added him to the blocked list. This episode got me thinking how unfair (and possibly costly) can be an insecure buyer.

Ebay,Tips for managing customer service with multiple employees,"I work for a company that recently opened an eBay store for some of our over-stock products. We are a well established company, but a bit more recently opened our eBay storefront.

Our eBay store essentially plugs in to our regular online store via Magento (via M2EPro) which runs like clockwork, however managing customer communication and return requests with multiple employees on the team is kind of tricky. We do pretty high volume, and if it wasn't for that it would be fine to have one person on the task. The issue is that there isn't a way to have employees ""take ownership"" of eBay message threads with certain customers, so that if a customer messages us one day and then replies back another day, they will likely be talking to another employee that might not be ""in the loop"" of what's going on.

Also keeping track of and staying on top of Return Requests can be a pain in the rear with the volume we have. Does anyone have any tips?",2,1,2016-01-25,EBAY,0.04713663458824158,0.9194058775901794,0.03345740959048271

Ebay,Buyer is forcing me to offer a refund for his mistake,"So I recently offered a couple of antique silver napkin rings up for auction on Ebay and other auction websites and received quite a lot of interest. Eventually the item was sold to a person in the States on Ebay who judging from his own sales clearly deals in that sort of thing. He paid for the items in a timely manner and I sent them. All was good.

Fast forward to today and suddenly I get a message that the buyer is not happy with the items he received, stating that they are damaged. The thing is, the damages (they are antique) are clearly visible on the many high resolution photo's (about six of them from different angles and close ups of halmarks etc) I posted in the listing, and even made mention of some of the damage in my short description.

He demanded a refund (dispite the fact that refunds were not offered in my listing) and gave several options, all of them resulting in a severe fiancial loss to me. I responded by saying that I would offer a refund for the items upon delivery, but not for the transport costs, since the mistake was clearly his. And I assumed since that is clearly the case I would have a leg to stand on if he opened a dispute.

Thing is, this is the first time I've had anyone ask me for a refund in over 300 transactions. And I assumed that like a dispute, I would have a chance to defend myself. Not so, apparantly. All of the options available put me at a loss. Either I refund the whole thing including transport costs, or partially refund in which case he still keeps the items for free, or ... well that's pretty much it. I can't open a dispute and defend myself.

Now obviously I am rather frustrated about this :-)

What can I do? Is there any way I can open a dispute, after having given positive feedback immediately after he paid? Can I contact someone from Ebay or something? Because as it stands I'm going to lose money and this guy is likely to do the same to someone else. At this point I don't care as much about the money as about the principle of the thing.

TLDR; Buyer demands refund for damage that is clearly visible on HR photo's, I apparantly can't open a dispute.",23,10,2016-01-28,EBAY,0.03375128284096718,0.9289923906326294,0.0372563898563385

Ebay,"Bought $1100 item that wasn't shipped, seller cancels order and issues refund that failed. Scam?","On 1/19, the seller accepted a best offer of $1100 on a NIB MacBook Pro mf840. It had free 2 day shipping. 

He hadn't marked anything shipped by 1/21, so I politely asked if he had shipped the item or when I should expect it, since I knew I'd need to be home to sign for it. He said he would ship the next day (Friday).

He never gave a tracking number, but I expected it was shipped so I had my wife wait for it.

It never came, so I messaged him again, politely wondering if it had been shipped. 

He sent me a message (I believe close to the time when I could file an INR) saying he's very sorry, but due to the bad weather in Detroit, several water mains had broke and flooded his basement, ruining all his electronics including ours. He cancelled the transaction and refunded $1100... But today the refund went from ""pending"" to ""failed"". PayPal says it was removed.

I called eBay and they said they would ask him to resend the refund, but that he has until February 3rd. 

Of course, I find all of this fishy. I googled him and found he has been arrested for mortgage fraud. His Facebook has a lot of posts asking for money to launch his own smart wristwatch.

Other items he sold that week (Apple parts) are receiving positive feedback. He mostly sells Apple parts but had said he used his Apple employee discount to buy a couple MacBooks and an iPad he was selling.

I've gone from thinking maybe he just had remorse to thinking maybe he needed a loan or I was scammed.

&gt; Doesn't match description or photos
I bought this vintage cast iron wok, specifically to put to use. I just used it for the first time this last Tuesday, and this is NOT cast iron, but base metal. The result for the eater, is a form of metal poisoning, which is palpable on the tongue, as an acidic metalic impact, which is very pronounced, and which is drying and dehydrating. I do not want to pay the cost to return this, and I am so sorry that this is not the true vintage cast iron wok that I was looking for, as I am a wok cook, in a world which is no longer producing true old formula hammered thin form cast iron woks. Please let me know what to do, as this one may have an added metal patina, over real cast iron, but I am not in a position to remove what is now there, as an added problem. Thanks,

Hello, thank you for purchasing my wok. This is indeed an estimated 50 year old cast iron wok, imported from Thailand. Cast iron, as you know, is a form of base metal. All cast iron cookware has its own unique and individual taste conditioned into the metal over time. 50 years is a lot of time and cooking. This wok had been cleaned and seasoned by my own hand and used regularly in my own kitchen with perfect results.

However, due to the high temperatures required to cook with a wok I only use a single layer of seasoning, thus it is not a thick seasoning and you will see the base metal of the cast iron. I would advise you re-season the wok with additional layers if you prefer to not see the base metal.

This item was sold with specific instructions that all sales are final. I will not be able to provide a full refund for this purchase, as it was sold in perfect description and condition. You have been provided an invoice which states No Returns, in addition to your purchase receipt which also states No Returns.

I am an individual, not a business, who sells personal belongings to those who appreciate and enjoy them as much as I do. As an individual who pays fees to provide these items to others, full refunds are not a part of my selling structure. Please provide photos of this item as it appears in your possession, so ebay and I may review any discrepancies. Thank you for your understanding, 


&gt; You should become more educated about cast iron. Read the wiki on Cast Iron: Cast Iron is not base metal---and that is exactly the point of cast iron and its importance historically in cooking, and why the loss of it, is a much decried social problem. Selling a cast iron wok, which is not cast iron, when you have not had it appraised by a metalurgist---means that you are exposing the new buyer-user, metal poisoning, as this is what I immediately had, upon using it, and eating what was cooked in it. Please note this in the future. Thanks,

Hi, Hari. Thank you for the Wiki info for cast iron. Without a physicians note, I can only consider your medical claim as suspect. I have used this wok on MANY occasions without any medical issues. To remedy this issue, please provide photographs of the purchased item with accessories as you have them in their received condition, as previously requested. Thank you for your cooperation.

&gt; You are not being sued. You should instead, understand that the issues of base metal passing as cast iron, is the key issue right now, in cookware, overall. Base metal poisoning in purchasing and using brand new Lodge cast iron, as an example, is 100% the norm, and too common to mention. The internet is rife with falsities and complaints on this subject as well. We lost the old cast iron formula for cast iron, in society in the mid 1990s. Since that time, and after numerous tries, I have only been able to find a vintage cast iron skillet, that matches up to the refinement of the cast iron formula that we had in my mother's kitchen, with her olden cast iron skillets, when I was growing up in the 1960s. There is much to this, and I encourage you to look into it widely, as it informs the issues of cooking today. More later,

At this point I'm not sure how to respond to this. He keep rambling. The wok he bought is pre-1960s and originates from Thailand. All of this he/she knows and I know as well, because of my own decent cast iron collection. But there is no ""lost formula"" that is mentioned.... And still no photos! I have asked twice now. Now I'm afraid this is definitely broken in some way and when I get it back I won't be able to sell it again due to damage. This user has 20 feedback since 2013 and has never left feedback for his purchases.

Hari, I understand fully that new cast iron cookware, such as Lodge brand can have it's negative qualities. However, your cast iron wok is not new from the 1990s. I have an very large cast iron collection of vintage cookware and am very familiar with its structure and properties. I need you to send me photos of this wok and accessories immediately. Why haven't you done this as requested? Please send me clear and precise photos, similar in style to those on my purchase page so I may be reassured that this has not been damaged. Thank you.

I have until Feb 2nd to give him a partial refund and to keep the damn thing. If I decide to do this, will they be able to appeal for a full refund or would the case be closed?

Ah, I just noticed the claim opened ""Doesn't match description or photos."" If he sent me the photos I am requesting, and ebay sees no discrepancies, then they will lose the case (maybe). Should I call ebay today and request that they step in to get this done? It's either that, or this guy is just stringing me along to get closer to the deadline.

&gt;Jenni: It was not clear that you are willing to make a return based on photos---are you?

~~Here is the tipping point! I drafted this response, but would like advice on revisions: ""If this item is pictured in its original condition, your refund will be automatically denied by Ebay and I will not be able to assist you. If this item appears damaged, I will also deny your request for return as you have been responsible for the care of this item. Ebay has been notified to review this case for fraudulent activity and will make a final decision.""~~

~~I want to give her the benefit of the doubt (turns out this is an older lady, not a man, whoops). But i don't want to throw all of my eggs in her basket just yet. This is what I want to also include in the message, but I'm not sure:~~

~~""I would be happy to compensate you for your time and effort in the effect of a partial refund providing you submit the photos. In this resolution, you will be allowed to keep the item in addition to a partial refund. If you still wish to return this item to me, you will be responsible for return shipping with insurance in addition to a restocking fee of 20% the original purchase price of $160 (the restocking fee will not include your original shipping charge of $42 as this was a charge directed to USPS mailing service). Metal poisoning is a serious allegation and will not be tolerated by Ebay or myself. If this is an attempt to get a free item, your case will be closed.""~~

EDIT: After speaking with an ebay rep, I will be sending a short response with instruction. ~~Still revising it, but thinking this will be good enough:~~ Sent: ""Hello Hari, your return request will be reviewed when your photos have been submitted today. Ebay has been notified to review this case.""

&gt; Yes I wll send photos today, vis a vis a return. I will do it in about an hour. Thanks, Hari

Freaking hours later:

&gt;Here are two photos, in an effort to return this wok, with 2 wok rings, and a sieve, see the attachment. Thanks, Hari

I am assured now that it isn't broken, the photos are near identical as my original listing's photos. I will not reply until tomorrow. I'm not sure how to reply to her now that I know it is in perfect original condition. What would ebay think, now having proof this is as described? What do you think?

Reply with photos:

I have also included two photos from the original listing. Pending review. Please wait for instruction.

Reply I'm going to submit:

""Hello Hari, I have reviewed this request for return with three ebay representatives over the course of the week. They each have advised me on the outcome of your request and my options. Each representative has reviewed the descriptions, photos and all related material involved with the case. Each representative has come to their own, individual, conclusions and advised me on how to move forward. The following conclusions were made by the ebay representatives about your case for return: The descriptions listed in the original sales listing and here in your messages match. The photos you have provided also match original purchase condition. Each representative decided for me that this case is invalid and that you are trying to abuse the ebay return system due to Buyer’s Remorse. Three factors lead to this decision:
 
""(1) You have stated that you cannot mail this back to me due to the required cost ($42). This leads me to believe that you should not have made the purchase in the first place and you are attempting to keep this item in addition to your original $160+$42 payment due to buyer's remorse and financial constraints.
 
""(2) Your opinion that the cast iron wok was ""poisoning"" you was unsubstantiated and you were unable to provide any form of proof beyond your own taste and research. I provided you with additional instructions and information regarding the use of cast iron.
 
""(3) You have attempted to claim that this item is not as described, stating that it is a ""base metal.”. When questioned further you stated that ""Lodge"", the most common brand of cast iron, also uses base metal in their cast iron, suggesting that millions of people are being poisoned a day due to use of items such as mine, because we have lost the ""ancient cast iron recipes.” I understand that the words ""rare"" and ""vintage"" may have lead you to believe that this wok was made by a ""previous formula” for cast iron. I assure you that the listing was written in good faith to provide all information available about its age and origin and was NOT written to suggest that the item is 200+ years old. This wok had been in production at the same time as Lodge, Wagner, Griswold and many other companies within the last 100 years.

""In summary: You have provided photo evidence that you have the same wok in your possession, along with the accessories. You have filed a ""not as described"" claim against an item that is as described, by your own admission and proof. It is against ebay policy to attempt to do this and can result in account suspension and/or termination. 

""An ebay representative has advised me that a gesture of good-faith, I may choose to refund the original shipping cost of $42 at my expense in order to award you some closure. As the suggestion is most generous, I have agreed with this representative and will be refunding you the $42 original shipping charge. I would suggest that, in the future, you take careful consideration to prevent further ""misunderstandings"" of this nature. I trust that this has resolved the issue. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you require additional clarification from myself or ebay.""

Ebay,"I was just scammed, what do I do?","I mailed the package through USPS.

The very moment I discovered that the email that was sent to me was a scam, I paid to have the package intercepted. The package was sent using 2-day priority (which makes sense why they would do that). 

I'm worried because I haven't read a single story about package interception actually working and I already paid for the service. I cannot file a claim or report besides reporting the email to Ebay. I tried talking to someone from Ebay, but I'm only redirected to contact Paypal. Since the transaction wasn't actually recorded with Ebay, they cannot help me. I tried calling USPS to ensure that the package is successfully intercepted as it won't be delivered until the 1st of February, but I'm only met with automated calls. I tried for the last 2 hours to speak with a human, but it never goes through. The item was worth at least $330 and I It was the first item I've ever sold on Ebay.

I admit I was an idiot and caught up in having someone pay full price for my item. I should have done more digging and researched about scams before selling the item. I should have been more critical about how selling something on Ebay works but I've never done it so I wasn't really aware of how it works. I should have looked that up too.

I sent the package yesterday at around 9:20 and i just received an update that it arrived at the Origin facility and is currently in-transit. 

I can only cross my fingers and hope that USPS tracking tracks and returns the item. 

I just want to know if there's anything else I could do to ensure that I get my package back, I'm completely helpless here.

Thank you.

Ebay,Ebay $5000 Gift Card Redeem Limit,So eBay has a $5000 gift card redeem limit per verified paypal account. Does anyway know how to bypass that? I mean I've tried registering a business paypal account on top of my personal one but it allowed me to redeem one only. It is verified as well. Any ideas?,4,2,2016-01-31,EBAY,0.02476232871413231,0.9248862266540527,0.05035145953297615
Ebay,Sent a partial refund on overpayment of shipping then had to cancel the transaction. Do I manually refund the rest? Or does eBay?,"Sold a kitchen aid mixer to someone in Denmark, I am in the US. I received a discount on shipping for $30 and I passed that on to them. Then we mutually decided to cancel the transaction. I started a request through eBay, they just approved it. I do not see that eBay issued the full refund for the remaining amount they paid. Do I need to manually send that? Or is there just a time lag?",3,2,2016-01-31,EBAY,0.16402103006839752,0.7896146178245544,0.04636434093117714
