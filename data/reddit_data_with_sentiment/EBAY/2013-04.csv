Ebay,"Any Canadians thinking of stopping using eBay due to these new ""import charges""?","I went to buy a $75 dollar item and ebay was trying to charge me a ~$25 import fee.  

I mean I understand that there are fees to import to Canada but that's just a ridiculous amount.  Even fedex doesn't charge that much and that's with their $10.50 fee just to import and not the actual import fees.

And looking around it seems the sellers aren't even aware of how much buyers are being charged in these fees.

It's just getting really annoying to me how much ebay is trying to rip people off with all the fees they charge.  Really wish another viable alternate to ebay shows up soon because this is pissing me off.",3.0,8,2013-04-01,EBAY,0.08962062746286392,0.847018837928772,0.0633605346083641
Ebay,Two different kinds of sellers,"I recently purchased a University of Miami hat and sweatshirt from different sellers.

The person who sold me the hat sent me a hat that used a different color scheme, was off-color,  and was made by a different company (not the brand name one that I paid for). When I messaged him asking for a refund, he refused, saying the hat was 100 percent authentic. When I explained the differences between the hat used in the pictures and the hat he sent me, he refused to respond.

The person who sold me the sweatshirt refunded me $5 immediately after my purchase because he used a high quality camera and he did not want me to be disappointed by the colors of the sweatshirt, saying that the green was not as deep (I couldn't notice a difference). When I received the sweatshirt it was in better condition than described and it also included a University of Miami beanie. When I asked her about the beanie, she said that he found it in my house and she thought that it would go well with my sweatshirt.

Two completely different sellers. Sorry for the rant, I just wanted to tell someone about my experiences.",6.0,6,2013-04-01,EBAY,0.05261504650115967,0.9140609502792358,0.033324021846055984

Ebay,New retardation with negative feedback and scammer.,"TL;DR - Ebay still has a business where people arn't allowed to make any common sense decisions at all.

This happened with my brothers business and I oversaw it and have dealt with the scammer.

Buyer buys product (Â£20~) using a CC or some method which causes it to be pending.
Brother accidently clicks dispatched before its cleared but does not dispatch the item because he was aware of it pending.
Payment is now cancelled
Buyer is Pmed and asked if he cancelled it or anything like this.
Buyer pretends to be an idiot and says he knows nothing.
Paypal ask my brother what he would like to do now the funds are pending so he just says full refund as he still has the item
Buyer leaves a negative feedback slandering the business


Now today after a long phone support conversation I find out from ebay they can confirm it was the buyer who cancelled the payment once it was marked as dispatched.
However they cannot remove the feedback because he ""paid"" and it does not meet X criteria to be removed.


I have since phoned the guys dad (it was the only phone number available on the internet) and told him we will pursue legal action against him if it's not removed, which we probably will. Updates to follow.",16.0,5,2013-04-02,EBAY,0.2068587690591812,0.7767493724822998,0.016391903162002563

Ebay,I need some advice on getting scammed.,"I sold 4 DLC pre order codes on ebay. The guy purchased them and said that one of the codes (one of the least expensive) was used. I had never used it and know for a fact it never fell in to anyone's hands but my own. He asked me to correct the problem by sending him another code or a full refund. Well seeing as he had used the three expensive codes and I didn't have another code he knew he had me backed in a corner. I was afraid of buying her code on ebay and sending it to him because he could just as easily say that the new code didn't work. So I looked up the code he wanted on ebay and offered to refund him the exact amount of that code so he could purchase it that way everyone was happy. He then gave me bad feedback ""Buyer sent me used DLC and told me to go buy it somewhere else"" I have never gotten bad feedback and never been ripped off. I do not know how to handle it or how to open a ticket with ebay, I reported him twice but they seem to have changed a lot of menus since I last had any sort of problem.

Ebay,Questions about an item I sold and now auction winner wants a refund.,"I sold my MacBook Pro on March 23rd on eBay.  Ended up going for about $670.  The machine has NEVER had any sort of issues since I bought it brand new in 2008.  

A few minutes ago I get an ebay message from the person who purchased/won the auction.  Here is what the message said:

*Hey, so the package finally arrived. For the first few days it ran just fine, but once I transferred some pictures and music over, it starting going super slow--even with no applications running. I took it in to a Mac repair place and they said it may be that the hard drive is failing. 
There are several things I could do, but I think the simplest would be to ship it back to you and have you give me a refund. Will that work for you?*

I find this extremely hard to believe.  This thing ran like a champ the entire time I owned.  This buyer also has no buyer/seller feedback whatsoever.  In fact, he created his account the day the auction ended.  It left me very leery selling it to him. 

Now I'm worried if somehow he may be trying to scam me?  What are his rights in regards to any returns or filing a claim if I don't agree with his request?  If I have to accept his return I suppose I will but it's such a huge pain in the ass!  

What would you do?

Ebay,Signatures are required for items over $250 -- what if an item is *exactly* $250?,"I recently bought an item whose final value ended up being exactly $250. With shipping, it was aroind $260. The seller provided a Priority Mail tracking number right away, and two days later the tracking information showed that it was delivered.

The only problem is -- I never got it. The seller says that because it says ""delivered"" it's out of their hands.

Looking through various eBay and PayPal sites, it looks like $250 is a magic number. Above that, sellers are supposed to get signature confirmation. This seller didn't do that -- were they obligated to? The info seems kind of vague; depending where I look, I see that it's necessary only for items valued over $250, or I see that it's necessary for items valued $250 or above, or I see that it's necessary for total transactions over $250, or that it's necessary for total transactions $250 or above.

Now I don't want to screw over an honest seller. But I'm not sure if I'm being scammed. They don't have any seller feedback, and only a handful of buyer feedback. Now my mind is wandering to such scenarios as them mailing something small to any other address in my zip code (since zip code is all that USPS tracking shows)... Of course, it's also possible that it was delivered and someone stole it off my porch before I got home from work.

In any case, I guess I just want to know if the seller had an obligation to get signature confirmation (which would have prevented the theft if that's what happened). Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",13.0,2,2013-04-03,EBAY,0.043768804520368576,0.9199033379554749,0.0363277867436409

Ebay,Questions about listing numerous items.,"I've been on eBay since I was 16 (I'm now 28), so I know the ins and outs of eBay. I might have found a job working for a company that parts out cars, listing the parts in their eBay store (they've never had one before). I'm currently a top rated power seller (I have a VERY small business on there, that really only covers my cell phone bill every month).


My question is for the people who have to make listings on a regular basis. How long does it take you to do a listing from start to finish? The reason I ask, is because whenever I add a new product (I find something at a garage sale or thrift store to buy and resell), it takes me about a half hour from the moment I research it, to the time it is listed. I know if I got this job, it would be a bit unrealistic to list 2 items an hour.

Are there any easier ways or more efficient ways of doing this?

Thanks.",6.0,5,2013-04-06,EBAY,0.029234804213047028,0.9291267395019531,0.04163847491145134

Ebay,A couple questions about wanting to sell items on eBay.,"I have quite a lot of coins that I would like to try and sell but not as a really big seller (~20 coins, don't have to sell them all at once). Anyway, here are my questions:

* If I have an eBay account on which I buy items, can I use the same to sell items or do I have to make a new one?

* According to [this table](http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html#if_auction), I can list up to 50 items a month for free and pay 9% as a fee of the final buying price. Is this correct and does it tally up and I just pay the fees before the end of the month?

* Does the 'up to 50 items a month' reset and go back to 0 at the end of each month?

* Am I allowed to make the listing 'Buy It Now' instead of an auction and will still have no other fees than the final buying price fee? (So instead of a coin starting at 99c, I have it 'Buy It Now' for $5)

Ebay,"Seller shipped to wrong address, was returned, now asking for *another* shipping fee?","The title is the boiled-down version, but here's the longer version:

I purchased a used razor on Ebay, paid within an hour or so, and got a shipping confirmation by the end of the day.  I have tracked the purchase as it went through USPS until it reached my home town, where the message read ""Moved, Left no Address"", and was sent back to the seller the next day.

I contacted the seller about this, and was told that it was sent to the proper address listed through PayPal, but that the PP address did not include an apartment number.  For reference, the only address I ever set up and used with PP includes the apartment number, and is also my confirmed shipping address.

Of course, the seller told me, they would be happy to reship for another iteration of the shipping fee.  

I have used PayPal numerous times prior and have never had an issue like this, and am unsure as to how a ""Moved, Left no Address"" message would crop up from a missing apartment number in any case.  What is going on?  And what should I do?  I'd rather not pay another inflated shipping charge (yes it is inflated, I have sent this item before through USPS and it costs about 1/3 the price charged), but am unsure where to go from here.

Ebay,A simple question about shipping costs as a seller.,"When you list an item and include 'free shipping' in the listing, doesn't that take your profit margin down? I mean in so far as eBay fees are concerned, with the final value fee taken out. Does it not make sense to add shipping costs therein to make up for this fee? Perhaps even inflate it .20, .30, even .40 cents for handling and maybe extra tape that you might need from time to time, to cover these fees?
For example say in the end I charge, say...5.90 for shipping and handling, for an item that fits into a priority mail envelope that costs $5.60 to ship?

Three weeks ago I had posted [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1al8a2/received_an_interesting_message_from_an/). It pretty much was about an international buyer with zero feedback (from Norway) who contacted me about shipping costs for international shipping. I told him shipping from the US to Norway would cost $25, which is the rate for First Class. Why would I make my customer pay an extra $25 on priority? Well after shipping via First Class International I did a little bit of research and realized that it doesn't come with tracking. It has been three weeks now and I got this message from the buyer:

""Hello again.

It seems like my package is stranded in some terminal in usa. Could you check up if its gone missing, or if there are some other problems that delays it?

Best regards,
Jorgen""

It seems like once the package has departed the US, it does not update with tracking information. Do you think I'm fucked? Should I call USPS to see if it has arrived in Norway or is that a waste of my time?

Ebay,Banned,"Beginning in October and going all the way to early January, I sold fake headphones and sports jerseys (even though every jersey that someone buys from Nike or Adidas is ""fake"" considering it isn't the quality players wear), and made a total on $1,000 profit.

Anyway, in terms of the jerseys, no one knew, and I never had any complaints; I knew that the headphones weren't even close to real looking though, and because of this I stopped selling them. Eventually eBay handed me a suspension and by the end of January I was suspended ""indefinitely"" (so banned basically).

I've called eBay numerous times, asking for them to unban me so I could sell other things (not as a hobby anymore, but like if I wanted to get rid of MW3, I could do it that way). Every time, I was put on hold for 10-15 minutes (at which point I hung up), except for the last time, where without even looking into another option the guy said ""you can't sell here, you'll have to find another website blah blah.""

So I now have three options: I squander what dignity I have left and go to craigslist (just kidding), I stop selling completely, or I make a new account, paypal, ebay and all.

I really am leaning towards making a new account, because I wouldn't be doing anything illegal and I don't see why not. My problem is, I know eBay would find some way to crack down on me and get me banned again.

Ebay,Help - Buyer went around set EBAY buyer requirements to snipe and win $1K auction.,"The requirement: Only pre-approved bidders from certain countries may bid on item.  

Buyers ""location"" is one of these countries, not EBAY contact address, and not ""verified"" Paypal address.  Due to the correspondence between buyer and myself, he is clearly forwarding this item to his country.  The verified address in Paypal is not where buyer will pick up item.  So regardless of delivery confirmation or direct signature, according to Paypal--im not covered under seller protection.

The business name in his EBay contact info and ""verified"" Paypal address is not real.  It looks like the name of a real business that was modified.  So when you google the business name, you get the real business that is actually located 20+ miles away, but not an exact name match.  But somewhere in the google search results there is a sentence that does match his business name.  But the context is an action and not a business.  For instance, if real business name is Reddit, buyers business name would be ""Chicks/Dig Reddit.""  (yes with the slash as well)  


I didn't fully realize most of this until later... I added shipping option because I was getting badgered by buyer and multipleID's from same ""location.""  At the time, I thought someone just ""really"" wanted to bid.  But when I added a verifiable shipping option, person bitched saying it was too much.  Which it was not.  I quoted two exact amounts from usps and fex.  At this point bidding was up to 7 or 800 something, and this guy bitches about 40 bucks then requests regular aimail???   I refused, then locked down auction requiring pre-approval. I told him that I wouldn't ship to him, that he was basically full of it (in as pro a way as possible).  I'm assuming buyer just changed his contact info or used one of his other id's.  But I didnt know about the location and contact matching rule until after.  Buyer contacted me using multiple ID's, and I know its the same person I have no ""proof."" All of the ""locations"" of the 5 or 6 ID's were the same.  Not impossible, but very non-probable.  I have had enough auctions to know that this whole thing doesn't jive, and I know something is not right.  

This wouldn't typically be a big deal--as I will usually ship anywhere, and I don't mind taking one for the team.  I also understand that a percentage of loss is just a cost of doing business.  But its $1,000 and the most expensive thing I have ever sold.  And the way buyer went about weaseling his way into my auction to outbid legit people with hundreds and 1,000's of feedback.  I have been selling to buy plane tickets for my family to uk and this was one of my last things to get enough.

Buyer paid and I can either ship to a shitty looking place.  I have Lexnex report showing address does not have the business that I am supposed to ship to.  The state tax records filed shows a different business is there.  I am obviously wanting to cancel.  Yes, I need this money, but I am 100% confident that I will be f***ed.  

The ebay process requires buyer to agree to cancel.  This guy ain't gonna cancel.  There is no reasoning with this person, they want what I have.  But they didn't want it enough to pay an extra $40 for express shipping so they had someone else buy it?  Zero confidence buyer is on level.

TL;DR

* Buyer weasels way into auction by going around EBay settings

* Buyer will forward to his location

* Seller supposed to ship $1000 item to shitty ""bombed out"" looking warehouse to a business name that is fake, so that it can somehow be forwarded to buyer.

* Is there a way to cancel/refund proper or break something?

* I'm ok with getting bad feedback but I don't want to lose my account.  I read this board everyday and see horror stories with calling support and resolution processes.  Yes, I was a slight gullible dumb ass and I didn't see this coming.  
 
Any advice or snide remarks appreciated.  I like selling on ebay as a hobby, but I feel like I am about to lose my item, then money and I have no control...except not ship.  I need this off of my plate as it's stressing me the heck out.",4.0,5,2013-04-16,EBAY,0.05267154797911644,0.9229937791824341,0.024334633722901344

* The user purchased the memory and had it sent to a US location and now they are starting a claim/dispute in order to extort the money from me and get the purchased product.
*The eBay Item sold clearly states that the sale is available only to buyers within the continental US.
* It is clear that ""Lau Wing Kiu"" aka eBay user ""Flowerwithpin2013"" is no more than a scam buyer.
* This scam takes advantage of eBayâs buyer protection program.

Ebay,Did I handle this the right way?,"I recently purchased two t-shirts on eBay. The shirts were designed by the eBay seller, and the subject of the shirts was an American sports team. 

On the item's original page it said that these were new designs (and it did say there were no refunds). What it did not say was that after you bought the shirt, the seller then uploaded the image to an online printing service, which then mailed the shirts directly to you. 

That became an issue when the shirts came in and the color was not as advertised. The orange in the shirt looked decidedly red (especially in one of the shirts) and I didn't feel adequately reflected A) the sports team I wanted the shirt to support or B) the concept art he used to sell the image. 

When I received the items I contacted the seller and he re-iterated his no refund policy, and gave me the web address of the company that printed them. I contacted that company, and I could have sent the shirts back to them for a coupon for another shirt purchase, but I didn't feel like I should have negotiate with them since they were never mentioned in the original transaction. 

I left negative feedback for the seller and contacted eBay about getting a refund since I didn't feel the product was advertised accurately. Eventually, after escalating the issue, eBay informed him that the product was not as advertised and he offered a refund. 

Was I too quick to give negative feedback? (It wasn't something I've done before). Is the shade of color being wrong too nit-picky?

Ebay,Advice on refunding a buyer while funds on hold in paypal due to open case.,"I sold an item to a German buyer. He then did not receive the item and instead of contacting me directly, opened a case in eBay requesting clarification of the shipping date. 

There is no tracking number, and I am fully aware of insurance and tracking codes for seller protection but that is not the issue right now.

I clarified the shipping date and have been in contact with him once, when he emailed me to ask me to send a replacement item.

I told him I may have a replacement item available in a week or two.

It turns out that I cannot get a replacement easily, so I just want to refund his money and move on. There is no proof, he may be scamming me, but I really don't care right now, it is not a huge amount of cash and I just want to close the case, be done with selling to Germans and get beyond the matter.

The problem is that he is not responding to my emails. I cannot refund his payment as paypal has the funds on hold while eBay is ""waiting for his response."" 

When I go to resolution center, it redirects me to eBay Germany and German paypal, which is unhelpful to say the least as I do not have fluent German.

Anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?

Ebay,"Want to pay for an auction, but the invoice is wrong","Well I am quite new to shopping on ebay, and have a possible problem on my hands.

I was interested in buying a deck of cards (Dishonored pre-order bonus or something), and messaged a seller if they offered international shipping was, and how much it would cost. On the item's page it said they only offered shipping to the states, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.

They said the price was the same as shipping in the states (right around 3.50 using the shipping calculator). I was fine paying that much, so I placed a bid on the item.

I won the auction, and was told to request an invoice for the total cost, shipping included. I did, and a day later, received an invoice for a total of 44$. The deck of cards I ordered cost 9.99, and the seller wrote the shipping as 35$, instead of 3.50$.

I immediately wrote an email explaining things, and asked for an explanation. The seller said that he made a mistake, and was having trouble re-sending the invoice. I sent him a link explaining how to do this, and that was the last time I have heard from him.

A few days have gone by now, and I have received an email from ebay telling me to pay for my item. I have requested that the transaction be cancelled, but have yet to hear back from him.

I have not paid yet, and am worried that a non-payment case will be opened against me, and that I will be forced to pay this absurd fee, or a mark will left on my account. 

I'm not sure what to do now, because the sellers communication has been so poor, and fairly unprofessional. I suggested that we cancel the transaction and re-list the item as a buy it now, for the price I won the auction at. At this point however, I don't trust the seller to even send my item properly packaged, if at all, so I would probably just take my money elsewhere.

What are my options? If I don't pay, and the seller does not send a new invoice, what could happen?

Ebay,Ebay Motors being gamed by parts sellers,"I'm writing about auto parts seller's misusing the wildcard ""fits:"" to get included in more search results.

A quick search of ""1970 Mustang"" returns 35,822 active listings. Include the filter ""-fits:"" (excludes any listing with ""fits:"" in the item description) to that search and get 10,407 results. These ""fits:"" listings are for car parts that may or may not ""fit"" the car you're searching for. 

Problem is, these listings are pure clutter - most are listed dozens of times - the same part/same seller over and over ad infinitum and appear in every search regardless of make and model.

Now, I recognize I can filter them out, but it shouldn't be necessary and searching specifically for ""cars and trucks"" limits useful results.

I'm hoping someone with Ebay can take a look at the problem - there are plenty of complaints.

One of them was a vintage toy playset with many action figures and accessories that I had to research and then describe.

I also listed a projector that I had to test and disassemble from the mount.  

Last night and typically what I do is take a handful of photos of each item, one after the other and then I store the item in my closet or garage.  I currently have about 250 items on ebay with half of them media(cd dvd video games) and the other half random stuff.  CDs, DVDs and video games are easy to list, the other stuff is very time consuming.  

TL;DR tell me your process of how you sell items.  Are you using a turbo lister or something similar for an item you only have 1 of.  Do you take photos, create the listing, store the item and then package it or do you take photos, package it, do the description etc.

Ebay,Is this tax bill going to kill our businesses?,"Assuming this tax legislation passes, are we in hot water? If I had to pay sales tax on stuff I bought online I would more than likely just buy it at a brick-and-mortar, especially if the price was comparable. 

Seems to me that eBay's main attraction to the general public is that you can get goods for cheaper than elsewhere. With fees recently raised and the possibility of sales tax being enforced I see eBay losing it's edge, big-time. The only way for eBay to stay competitive is to drastically lower fees to allow market prices to drop enough that the tacked on sales tax isn't a big deal. But, I highly doubt that is going to happen.

I've contacted ebay and they removed the nice feedback he left me.

**Dbag:** Dear z0mbie_slayer,

I just get the Bracelet and it doesn't go with my style, So I like better the one that is in the picture item 281090771025
I will send you back for exchange for that one that is reversible.
Thanks.

**Me:** Dear excalibur-jr,

It may just be cheaper for you to purchase another one instead of shipping that one back and paying for the shipping on the new one. I have one about to end at $8. If you really don't like the other one you can sell it of give it to someone as a gift. 

- z0mbie_slayer

**Dbag:** Dear z0mbie_slayer,

I don't think so, I'll send u back for a full refund.

- excalibur-jr

**Me:** Dear excalibur-jr,

I don't do refunds on specialty items because I cannot re-sell them, I specified that when I listed the item. 

- z0mbie_slayer

**Dbag:** Dear z0mbie_slayer,

At this point you will get a NEGATIVE feedback score!

- excalibur-jr

**Me:** Dear excalibur-jr,

I cannot re-sell the item so you would be putting me in the hole. I make these custom to order by hand and they take quite a while to make so the buyer gets excellent quality. I clearly selected no refunds when I listed the item because of this reason.

I asked you what you wanted your item to look like and made it to your specifications. I tried to help you out by letting you send it back and pay for the shipping on the next one. What do you want to do?

- z0mbie_slayer

He left me NEGATIVE feedback and said ""this guy is scamer he ripped me off and was very rude.NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELER!""

After contacting customer support, they were able to remove the feedback because I selected no refunds and I showed them our conversation.

B: i just bought your gamecube and i need to arange a pickup with u k

*So figuring he lived nearby I responded:

ME: When would be the best time/day for you? my schedule is pretty free and if I'm not around I can have someone give it to you at my address. Or we could meetup in Salisbury somewhere if needed.

*and he responds with:

B: i clicked local pickup by mistake so is there any way u can ship COD and do u need my address or any information 

*What does ""COD"" mean, anyway I respond with:

ME: Well, as shown in the listing; shipping is $12.00 so if you send me the $12.00 I will happily ship it to you.

*he responds with:

B:can you send it COD if not can u plz give me your address and i will send it to your address if not i can send it to paypal i will send it to that which one should i do plz respond if i mail it i will send it tomorrow in mail

*and (in 2nd message):

B: I need u to give me your address over phone if i mail it to your house my phone number is 985-***-**** call me if u want to tell me what to do either ship it to your address ,paypal, or send it COD tell me which one thank you have a nice day.

*I personally refuse to deal with my buyers over the phone due to the fact that anything ""could have been said"" instead I stick to eBay messaging so Ebay has every thing on record in-case something goes wrong. I respond with:

ME: I cannot put my PayPal address in an eBay message, so in attached photo you will see the address where you can send the $12.00 for shipping through PayPal. (Attached Photo with paypal email)

*Responds with:

B:Thank you so very much

*and immediately after that one with:

B: i wanted to send it to your home address i gave you my number to call me 

*and right after that one:
B: i will send you your money through paypal thank you 

*And happy with this response I reply:

ME: Sounds good to me! 

*He sends all $12.00 to my PayPal and messages me: 

B: i have sent you your money now can you send me the gamecube either today or tomorrow call me when you send it my phone number is 985-***-**** thank you bye

*Pretty happy that I have been paid for the shipping I reply:

ME: Thanks for the payment! I will drop it off at my local post office first thing tomorrow. You can find the tracking information for the item in your Purchase History. 

*and he replies:

B: thank you very much i will buy more stuff from you thank you 

*At this point I am quite glad that I finally got that box out of my house. He sends me 2 messages throughout the next week:

B:how long will it take for this idem to ship? 

B:how much longer should the idem take to deliver from Memphis Tennsee to Slidell Louisiana 

*I did not respond to these two mostly because it is information that he has access to and should expect a delay in shipping due to him paying for the shipping on a saturday night. He even left me positive feedback before he received it:

B (Feedback on my account): i thank you for your help 

*I am thinking this is the day he received it:

B: does the gamecube work? 

*Knowing that I fully tested the console the moment before I rubber-banded all of the cords and sealed it all in the box I replied with:

ME: I don't know why it would not work. 

*He then sends 4 messages and opens a case on me:

B: do you know anything about the gamecube im sorry but if not im going to send it back :( and i dont want to do that

B: here if you could call me at this number 985-***-****

B:  the reset button doesnt work im thinking the delver y person dropped it 

Case:  âBâ let us know that ""Nintendo GAMECUBE Platinum Console Fully Funtional 2 Memory Cards (NTSC)"" didn't match the description and has requested a refund. A case is open and you can view the case and the buyer's message in the eBay Resolution Center. 
B: all i want is a working Gamecube or my money back. 

*So I simply responded to the last message he sent with:

ME: Stated in the description: ""the Reset button is stuck in the down position"". Please read the description before bidding. 

*Here is the full description for you all:

 Up for auction is a Nintendo GameCube Platinum Edition with every thing needed to play and two memory cards. The Console is missing one of the covers on the bottom (see picture #3), A bit of he controller's wire insulation has came off and has been repaired with electrical tape, and the Reset button is stuck in the down position, none of this effects the game-play. The corners of the Cube are a bit worn. 

 (And all of my policy stuff)

*I replied to the case with selecting the option of allowing the buyer to return the item for a full refund. I have the slightest feeling that he will not send it back well packed or not send it back at all. I don't know, I guess only time will tell. I don't want to give you guys the buyers name or mine until this is all resolved, I hope you all understand.

Give me some love Reddit!

UPDATE: Buyer sent back the gamecube without letting me or eBay know but I gave him a refund for what he initially paid me (Cost of item only :D due to the whole local pickup ordeal) and that ended the case. mrmeep2013 and a few others are now on my blocked bidders lists, Thanks for telling me about that too Reddit!

Ebay,"On return policy; I think it's good, but it might be frightening.","After some issues occurred very early on in my eBaying, I intentionally wrote the longest most complicated return policy possible to try and deter people.  I believe it has worked, but I have no idea if it frightens off buyers ever.

Does anyone else have a return policy that reads like a legal document?

Edit:  I originally didn't want to post it, but fuck it.  Here it is.  Note that I don't even know if any of this is even allowed for me to enforce, because I have not had a return since I started using this.

Edit II:  I should say haven't had a crappy return.  I have good spirited returns of course - if someone is nice, I don't ""open a case.""

**A) RETURN POLICY: The buyer automatically accepts the full return policy of the seller Axxxxxxxxx upon completing a paypal transaction for an item purchased on ebay.com for a sale posted on the ebay account of seller. Should the buyer wish to return an item purchased, the buyer agrees to contact the seller within 14 days of the delivery date and this will constitute an open âcaseâ for the purposes of this agreement. No refund will be given to a ""non-communicative"" buyer - see item B)(3) of the return policy. By requesting a return the buyer agrees to return the item to the seller in the condition in which it was delivered to the buyer. No refund will be given on original shipping costs, as defined by the cost paid by the seller to the shipping agency, regardless of the shipping price paid by the buyer to seller. B) RETURN PROCEDURE AND ELIGIBILITY (1) The buyer must contact the seller within aforementioned period via eBay message or other electronically traceable methods. (2) The buyer agrees to return the item with adequate shipping practices similar to that in which the item was delivered so as not to damage the unit upon arrival to the seller. (3) The buyer agrees to cooperate with the sellerâs instructions on packaging and shipping practices for the return shipment. (4) Should the buyer neglect to ship the item in a manner agreed upon by the seller and the buyer, damages to the item shall not be the responsibility of the seller, in which case the damaged item will be returned to the buyer and no refund will be given. (5) Upon returning the unit, the buyer promises the returned item will be (5.a) the identical unit which was shipped from the seller to the buyer for the original sale verified by the serial number and other identifying marks (5.b) will not be damaged, either by the seller or during shipping. No refund will be given until 1 business day AFTER the seller receives the returned, undamaged item. No refund will be given in the case of policy violation of items (1) â (6.c.3) in which case the item will be returned to the buyer. (6) Partial refunds can be given as an alternative to returns, in the case of âitem not as describedâ (INAD) claims . A buyer must be âcommunicativeâ [B)(3)] to receive a partial refund and in initiating such a case, the buyer agrees to the policies herein. The buyer is required to provide photographic evidence, if possible, if the seller requests such or else no partial refund can be considered. A buyer is not entitled to a partial refund for any damage proven to, or otherwise agreed upon between seller and buyer, to have been caused during shipping. Unless otherwise agreed upon, claims to the shipping agency are the responsibility of the buyer. In the case of shipping damage the buyer can either accept a settlement to close the case, or initiate a return in which all of the policies of B)(1)-B)(6) shall apply. INAD claims will be handled and settled individually between the buyer and seller, who must make attempts to mutually agree to settlement of the claim for there to be a refund given, at which time the case is considered âclosed.â If a buyer accepts a monetary settlement for an INAD claim, the buyer may not initiate a claim to the shipping agency and the case is considered closed. Once a case is closed in regards to a transaction with the seller, the buyer forfeits his or her right to initiate a return or receive settlements for/open any further âitem not as describedâ cases, or open a claim to the shipping agency unless otherwise noted in communications between the seller and buyer. Any communications between the seller and buyer before or after a sale and/or claim may be recorded and can be used in unaltered form to enforce sellerâs return policy or for any reason, legal or otherwise. The buyer agrees in any case whatsoever that the buyer will not leave negative feedback to the seller or otherwise make any attempt to damage the sellerâs reputation once a case is closed. (6.a) If a buyer agrees to return an item, or begins communications with the seller to dispute and settle an INAD claim, he or she will be asked to electronically authorize the that the case is closed, at which time the policies of B(6) shall apply. (6.b) Upon closing a case as described in (6.a), the buyer agrees to remove negative feedback already left for an item addressed by said case. (6.c) Any action taken, outside of feedback left, taken by a buyer to damage the reputation of the seller is also subject to retroactive removal as described in (6.b). The policy of 6.c applies to, but is not limited to, (6.c.1) eBay forums (6.c.2) Yelp postings (6.c.3) any personal page or blog held by the buyer (6.c.4) any other medium on the world wide web, public or private, which is deemed to have the potential of reasonable impact on the seller and other potential buyers of the seller.**",15.0,7,2013-04-28,EBAY,0.11014101281762123,0.8605170249938965,0.02934194728732109

Ebay,Import charges to Canada as a buyer,"Hey, I'm thinking of buying something off an American seller, but I realized that there are ""import charges"" that will be provided at checkout. I have no clue how much the charge will be. I only have a limited amount of money in my PayPal account, and I am afraid the import charge send the price over the money I have in my account.

Ebay,"Well, I'm about to get negative feedback. There goes my Top Rated Seller","A couple weeks ago I sold a digital converter cable box. I listed it and described it by the brand name, and also RCA as it converts digital airwave signals to RCA outputs, as I figured that would be a keyboard people search for (as opposed to HDMI).

Well now the buyer is irate because I sent her some ""Made in China crap"" and not an RCA brand box like I said. The only place RCA showed up was in the listing description, and I had 4 large, clear pictures and in each one you can clearly see the actual brand name (along with the words Made in China).

Ebay,"eBay noob here, first time selling and I don't want to screw up.","So, I just (unbelievably) managed to sell a  Super Monkey Ball game for Wii. I plan on shipping it tomorrow, but I am a bit confused as to how this is all supposed to work.

eBay tells me I must print out a shipping label, but I must pay for online and I cannot do that, since I absolutely do not want my main credit card associated with my PayPal account. Currently I don't have a penny in my PayPal account, but planned on getting the PayPal MasterCard and just using that as the only card. My questions are; 

Can I entirely avoid paying for postage online, and just do it at a USPS location? 

eBay says the buyer has not completed the transaction. While I don't actually care that much if get scammed (this game is awful, I'm willing to freaking give it away), I would prefer some money. Should I continue with the shipping, or should I wait until they have actually paid? 

Once shipped, how do I let the buyer know it is shipped? How do I enter a tracking number for the buyer to receive? I want to keep my seller reviews positive, because I have a handful a games I would like to sell.

Ebay,Question regarding whether or not a payment has actually been made.,"First off, this is the first time I've sold on eBay, so I apologize if any of this sounds stupid.

I sold an item on eBay this weekend for a pretty large sum. The buyer asked me to send a PayPal invoice for the total, and I did. I received an email the next day (this morning) from eBay that says:

*""Your item is marked as payed and you need to send it out as soon as possible. Ship out the item now and update the tracking number on eBay via myeBay.*""

Then, the buyer emailed me and said that they have already paid, and have a receipt for payment and to ship the item out.

I still haven't received any notifications from PayPal or anything, and the invoice is still marked as ""sent"" and pending payment.

Does it sound like the payment was actually made, or is it possible for the buyer to tell eBay that they made the payment without actually making one?

Thanks!

**EDIT: I forwarded the email from ""eBay"", stating that it had been paid, to spoof@ebay.com and the security team confirmed that it is a scam. Thanks for the help guys.**

Edit 2: Called eBay Customer Support and tried to cancel the transaction and have the 10% fee refunded. I was told I can not have the fee refunded if the buyer does not agree to cancel the transaction (not likely to happen), so I will have to wait until tomorrow morning to open an unpaid item case.

Edit 3 (8:00 am PDT 4/30): Contacted the buyer and asked if he agreed to cancel the transaction. No answer, of course. Looks like he just jumped ship on the whole deal. Still have to wait another hour to open an unpaid item case. Seems like eBay should have some sort of protocol to free people from transactions that are obviously failed scams, but hey, that's just my two cents.

Edit 4: Just opened an unpaid item case. Now have to wait until May 4th to close it and receive a FVF credit for my item. 

I understand that eBay needs to provide buyer protection, but what about the sellers? I'm trying to unload an item to get money for school and some random guy, with 1 click, puts it on lock down for a week. Seems lopsided.

Edit 5: [Checked the buyer's feedback today because I noticed he had gotten some in the last couple of days.](http://i.imgur.com/aY0vVvV.jpg) Of course, I still have to wait 2 days to close my unpaid item case, get my FVF back, re-list my item, and hope that it doesn't just get bought by another scam account and locked down for another week. Good thing eBay is protecting its buyers!

Final edit: Received this email from eBay today:
