Ebay,Will I earn a bigger profit by listing an Xbox now or after Black Friday?,I want to sell my 360 with some games and controllers but I'm not sure when I should list it. Give me some reasons why listing it now or after Thanksgiving would yield a larger profit. Thanks!,1,1,2010-11-05,EBAY,0.027964984998106956,0.833422064781189,0.13861298561096191

Ebay,"Need advise on the best ""CYA"" method to deal with a scam buyer","As a first time seller, I put an iPhone up for sale and after the auction ended I got a notice that the winning bid was four times my initial sales price.  The buyer's account was created today and looking over their bidding history, they have about twenty or so other really inflated winning bids on other similar items.  I sent the user an invoice from within ebay and got a reply message (through ebay's message center) a few hours later giving some story about the phone being a surprise birthday present for his fiance.  He included an address and requested that I verify it for shipping (I'm not sure of the significance of this).  He also asked for my paypal e-mail address for payment.  I'm pretty sure that the invoice that ebay sent included a way to pay through paypal and that I don't need to give out that information.

Anyway, since I'm new at this, what is the proper way to deal with this so that I can protect myself from falling victim to whatever malicious intent this guy may have?  I haven't yet replied to the message and want to make sure I don't say the wrong thing.  Also, what is the point of this type of scam anyway?

Thanks for your help!",5,2,2010-11-12,EBAY,0.025531047955155373,0.9183393120765686,0.05612964928150177

Ebay,Advice on Selling Vinyl Records,"So, I have roughly 40-50 vinyl records I want to sell. Roughly half are electronic music, and half are scratch/breakbeats. I guess I'm not sure if there's a ""good"" way to sell these things. Individually, they aren't worth that much and probably aren't worth putting up and selling for $5-7 and having to ship it. It seems to make more sense just to sell them in bulk (maybe just split them into assorted electronic music and assorted scratch/break records). Does anyone have any advice or experience with this kind of thing?

P.S. I guess the same thing can apply to movie DVD's and music CD's as well.",3,1,2010-11-23,EBAY,0.02183230035007,0.9315878748893738,0.046579793095588684
