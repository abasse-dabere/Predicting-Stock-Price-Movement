Ebay,Will ebay ever side with sellers again?,"I sell about half as much as I buy on ebay.  

Every couple of months I get a return request that I know isn't true but I always know ebay will side with them.

Ebay,Buy &amp; then cancel quickly. Some sort of Scam?,"I complained about this activity in another thread a few weeks ago.  Since then the rate of this has increased... from ""about"" (~) one a week, to something over that.

Just now I got a sale &amp; then cancellation request. This is one is suspicious as the buyer has 0 feedback, is an international buyer (shipping more than the item), &amp; the buyer did not request cancellation through ebay, they just sent me an ebay message, exactly 15 minutes later.

All very suspicious.

Paypal shows the payment as a ""regular"" payment.  No echeck or anything, no email about the transaction being ""under review"".

I'm going to delay refunding for as long as possible because I am suspicious.

1) is it a scam of some sort?

2) if so, how's it played?

Ebay,eBay UK August 'promo' actually just installing more fees....,"So not sure if anyone else has noticed this change?

For months I've had 100 free listings per day on [ebay.co.uk](https://ebay.co.uk) (though I've never got anywhere near hitting that number). Realised today that a new promo is running (instead of the old one) that says no insertion fee BUT they're adding 35p to the 10% final value fee - pegging it as a 'no sale no fee' promo, but given 95% of things I list sell it's essentially just a guaranteed extra 35p they get on every sale.

I'm not a particularly prolific seller but my partner sells a lot and worked out that if this had been running over the last year (instead of the 100 free per day) we'd have paid an extra £250 in ebay fees!

Has anyone else noticed this / have issue with it?

Ebay,"Item says it will ship from US, but then ships from China trend. Anyone else notice this?","I don't buy on eBay a lot, I mostly sell, but I noticed a pretty frustrating thing that's been happening lately.

So about a month ago I buy something. It says ""Item Location: Los Angeles, CA"" which is pretty close to me. I think cool, and buy. It doesn't arrive on the date. I look and the tracking and it says it's coming from Hong Kong! Seller just gives me a partial refund when I complained.

Yesterday I purchased a charger for my old PSP I found in storage, says it's first class coming from Arcadia, CA. Even closer. Now today label says it's coming from china with DHL. I talked to my friend who buys a lot an he's saying that he's noticed this happening to him too.

Ebay,Item Destroyed in Global Shipping Program,"First time having this happen to me with anything but an item I shipped was destroyed at some point during shipping.

Item name,
Item name a,
Item name b,
Item name c,

Ebay,Bent pins on new motherboard,"Hello All,

I recently purchased a few hardware parts (CPU, motherboard and RAM sticks) in order to upgrade my home-test server. I don't usually by expensive parts from eBay, but since these were either hard to find in my local market, or extremely expensive, I decided to buy them from eBay.

All parts seemed fine until yesterday that I received the motherboard. When I opened the socket protector and lifted the metal bars in order to place my Xeon CPU, I immediately noticed a few bent pins on both edges of the socket...

I work in the IT for several years and I've been building computers for the past 15 years. I know it's easy to bent pins (although I've never done it) and I am very careful when it comes to building computers and much more when it comes to placing the CPU in the socket. The motherboard is a Supermicro, intended to be placed on my home server. Just saying all this in order to indicate that this is not the first time a build a computer.

I also want to clarify that the seller is not an person but a store with high feedback and that's why I chose them, because I wanted to avoid issues like that. According to them and their listing, the motherboard was a brand new one. I'm not here to blame them, especially since the package was held (and I guess opened since I didn't received it sealed) in the Customs. 

But all I know, is that currently I am stuck with a non working server (on which I run all tests before deploying them in my work environment), and with a 400 euros motherboard (about 250 the motherboard, 60 shipping and 90 customs) which arrived DOA to me and I never damaged.

The current status of all this, is that I immediately opened a case requesting a return, which they accepted but without sending me a return shipping label, so I will ship it today on my expenses. They also replied to me that SM doesn't cover bent pins (no one does) and that they charge 50$ for the socket. They also noted that this is ""the most common user error""...

I've never been in a situation like this before. I have opened cases in the past and get refunded for small, ""Chinese"" staff that cost 2-3 euros, but never for an item as expensive as this.

What should I do in order to prove that all this mess was never caused by me and get a full refund?

I'm talking about a refund and not a replacement, since to be honest, I don't want another motherboard from them, cause I don't even want to imagine to get in a loop of the above once again...",5,3,2018-08-03,EBAY,0.0734759047627449,0.8854366540908813,0.04108745604753494

Ebay,"I think I'm getting scammed, what should I do?","Hey there, I recently sold my first item on ebay, it was a rather expensive (at least for me) old casette player. I shipped it to the address and name I got from Paypal and yesterday the package finally arrived at the buyers house.

Today I got a message on eBay from the buyers account, saying that he was the father of the account owner, giving me a different address and name, and that the player was **""totally defect""**, he wanted his money back, but if possible **without ebay getting involved**.

I don't think that this is true, since I've a.) tested the player one time before listing the item, and one time before shipping it, both times it worked, which I also have videos of and b.) I've used lots of bubble wrap, and big air pads when shipping.

I've also asked him if he thinks that it got damaged while shipping, to which he responded with ""no, the packaging is fine, also I don't see any outer signs of damage on the player"". A few messages later, when I asked him if maybe he just uses it wrong, he told me, that he is a profesional in this area, and **opposing to his first message** where he stated that it was ""totally defect"", that everything **except playing** cassetes works.

The package was insured by the shipping company (DHL), so should I just tell him to fill out their damage claim form and send it to them since it was working before I shipped it? Should I message the eBay support? It really seems shady to me that suddenly his father also uses his account, and that in his first message he says it's totally defect, and later he says that only one function isn't working.

The item is shipped to me so my question is do I wait until I receive it and then contact the seller/ebay, or do it now that I noticed it even though I haven't yet received the item.

I am a complete novice at selling on Ebay and have never had to deal with a refund request. From reading online it sounds like I do not have any choice but to honor the refund. The buyer is claiming that the item received was not a described, as the soles of the shoes are not immaculate. The 'never worn outside' description was to address the top portion of the shoes (leather) - the function / form are perfectly in tact. My thought is the buyer decided against the shoes after almost a month and is using this as an excuse for a refund. Any thoughts / recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Instead they just pushed the button. I called Ebay customer service this morning and told them my story. They saw that I have 30 day returns and sided with me.

 I have found that if you treat them with respect, they will usually do the same. So, if you do get a negative feedback that you truly feel was unjust. Take some deep breaths. Wax on and Wax Off and call Ebay using a clam professional voice. They hopefully will work with you.

Ebay,Buyer returned item but to wrong address.,"Hi there, after reading horror stories on here of sellers losing out I'd like to know what sort of chance I'd have with this case. 

Long story short my buyer purchased an item off me which totaled around £50, they then sent me a message a few days later saying they would like to return the item as ""it wasn't working""

I honoured the return and sent them a label using ebays prepaid system to my return address, my return address was 125 wheelie bin drive. 

Anyway, she sent it back a few days ago but she did not use the prepaid return label I sent her, she went to the post office and sent it from there, however she sent it to the wrong address, she sent it to 128 Wheelie bin drive, I know this because of the tracking number she uploaded along with a copy of the receipt she sent me. 


Now, I have checked with the neigbour at 128 and they said they haven't got any parcels, he is a very dodgey person so I presume he is lying, anyway, it was addressed to 128, not 125.


The buyer is insisting that I told her to sent it to number 128 even though the prepaid label I sent her States 125 along with my return address on my eBay profile. 


Since I don't have the item as she sent it to the wrong address, will I have to refund her or will eBay take her side even though she was at fault..

I was scammed by an otherwise very trustworthy looking account (check my post history if you want to see details of the scam).

Ebay,Suggestion: Ability to instantly cancel an order,"So this morning I am browsing deals on mobile and there's one where you have to see the price in your cart. I went to next step to see if the ""PRONTO15"" code was live yet, and it wasn't. I go to hit the 'alt-tab' equivalent key of my android device, to switch from eBay app to Chrome app where the 15% off sale details were. But I fat fingered it and hit 'Confirm and Pay' instead, and just like that, I've prematurely ordered something that I wanted to order tomorrow, when the code goes live. 

So I immediately submit a cancellation request, and 5.5 hours later I get an email from the company that the item is getting ready to be shipped.

This is incredibly frustrating for me, because I don't want to pay to have to ship this bulky item back, and especially when I wanted to buy it just the next day.

I understand that this is frustrating to the sellers as well, because as I understand it there is a 30 cent fee that isn't returned to them, and it is more bookkeeping work.

Now, Amazon I know lets you 1. alter payment method or 2. cancel an order before it is shipped, automatically through their system. So you don't trouble a seller, and you yourself aren't troubled because of an honest mistake. 

Why oh why can't eBay implement something like this I wonder?

Ebay,What happens if the seller refuses to accept the return and refuses to provide return shipping?,"My fiancé ordered a 2016 12 in Macbook for me and what arrived was a very old, very large Macbook Pro. It was shoved into a medium sized priority mail box with the end tabs bent over the edge of the laptop and taped into place to make the laptop fit, totally inappropriate packaging especially for a fragile item like a laptop, but I thought maybe the seller had wrapped it up with dozens of layers of padding to the point that it wouldn't fit properly in the box...We opened a return request pretty much immediately after opening the box and realizing that -- no -- it's not wrapped in a million layers, it's just a BIG ASS LAPTOP that is TOO BIG FOR THE BOX! 

After providing detailed photos of the item and the box it arrived in, the seller provided us with the dimensions of a Macbook Pro and of a medium USPS priority mail box, claiming that a Macbook Pro \*could not possibly\* fit into a medium sized box, so he challenges my assertion that we received a Macbook Pro in the medium-sized box he shipped. (for reference, the priority mail box is 13.625"" long and the laptop is 14.25"" long -- less than an inch difference. So we put the laptop back into the box and took pictures to show how the end tabs had been bent to fold OVER the remaining quarter-inch of laptop, and taped into place....boom, it certainly does fit.) Without actually saying so, he insinuated that \*we\* altered the box to its current mangled state, and that we are trying to scam him. 

I genuinely feel like I am taking crazy pills, since I am certain \*he\* is the one trying to scam \*us.\* I'm starting to wonder if this was all a set up - that he purposely used a medium-sized box that just barely fits this laptop with the express intention of using that excuse when we inevitably wanted our money back. 

The return request currently says the seller has until 9 August (today) to accept or deny the return request. He has stated in the messages that he will not accept the return, but he hasn't actually denied the request. I called ebay today and they said to give it one more day, and if he hasn't done anything by tomorrow, then I should call back and they will step in to resolve the issue.

Ebay,Seller says item is unavailable.,"Hey guys,
                   Just wondering what the correct course of action is here. I bid on a mouse and ended up being the only person to bid and won. I paid for said item yesterday and today the seller messages me to tell me that the mouse is no longer available and that I should cancel my order. A few minutes later he issues a full refund through paypal of which I'm notified via email.

Am I supposed to cancel the order or is there another protocol that ebay suggests you follow?

Ebay,What's the point of leaving negative feedback if the seller can just call ebay and have it removed?,This infuriates me. I bought a comic listed as NM+ / beautiful condition.

The seller decided to just refund it instead of making me return it. Now the item shows up as cancelled in my purchase history and the negative feedback is nowhere to be seen on his profile.

Ebay,Is this lady trying to scam me?,"So I just sold a pair of shoes yesterday and I got a message from the buyer asking about the condition, extra pics, sending an invoice, her phone number, etc. She also asked for my paypal which I thought was weird, but I sent it to her anyway. She then asked for a phone number to text me on and a few minutes later I get a text from her. The odd thing was it was a different number than what she sent me. She then said that it was a gift for her brother, and that he got excited and logged on to her eBay account which eBay saw as third party activity and that there’s some issue with it and she’ll get it resolved. This morning I got an email from eBay saying the purchase was cancelled due to unauthorized activity on the buyers account. I offered to relist the item so she could buy it again through eBay but she refused. 
What I’m thinking is that she’s going to try to purchase the item from me outside of eBay and try to refund the money on PayPal or not send it at all. Is there any possibility her story is true? I’m pretty sure she’s trying to scam me, but she hasn’t done anything yet. I just want to know if I should give her the benefit of the doubt or not waste my time.

EDIT: yup she’s a scammer. I was hoping the story would be true and we would be able to do all this through eBay but she just asked to have it sent to Nigeria and she’ll send the money through PayPal lmao",4,3,2018-08-09,EBAY,0.038309648633003235,0.9261210560798645,0.03556930273771286

Ebay,People taking longer to pay...is it just me?,When I first started selling on eBay maybe a year ago anytime somebody would make purchase (or win an auction) they would pay instantly or the next day at the latest.

I waited an entire week for a buyer to pay (mainly just wanting to see how long it would actually take them) and even sent a payment reminder. I finally decided to open up a case and they finally paid. 2 days after they paid (the same day I had mailed the item) they messaged me asking if I was going to hurry up and send the item!!!!

Ebay,Looking for sellers,"Ok, so I'm tired of the eBay fees, I run my own store and I'm losing $1000 a month in eBay fees. I know some losing more than that. So I need sellers who wouldn't mind me listing their products on my website (you can still continue to list on eBay and I'm working on an import script from eBay to my website) but I need content so I can build my SEO. I have a few products, but I don't want to just help myself, I want to help everyone. My site will never have any fees, EVER (I'll put it in writing I don't care) I just want the fees to be gone. I have a dedicated server that I am barely putting a dent in for the few clients I host, so I'll host as many stores as I can and we can ride this train together. All I ask is that you pass some of your savings onto the customers. This will help us be cheaper than anyone else and I could post a link to eBay/Amazon showing we have the cheaper price. Please message me if you would like more details.

Also, the merchant backend that I will give you access to will need an API key to Paypal, which will be your only fees. So all purchases go directly to you with no commissions taken.

For anyone interested I'm a PHP developer and Web Designer (Well... My girlfriend is the designer) with 15 years of experience. If there's any suggestions you have, I can implement it into my platform. I also have 5 years of Email Marketing and A/B testing experience. I have plans to integrate within the next week MailChimp (So you can email your customers with sales or new products) and Google Analytics so you can monitor traffic vs your sales.

Thank you for your time.

Ebay,"Ebay buyer payment is ""Pending"", dispute opened a month after purchase on PayPal?","Hope this is the right place to post this as it has more to do with PayPal. A month back on July 12 a buyer made a payment of around $30 via ebay. Buyer sent a number of messages as normal, got their items done and sent. They sent a message saying they'd look at my other items and thanked me for the items they received. 

Today, exactly one month later, a dispute was opened in PayPal. ""There are unresolved problems. Check on the status or respond"".

Sounds like either an unauthorized purchase was made for my items or they are trying to scam me out of money:

""The buyer reported that someone made the order without their permission. Until this case is closed, we've also placed a hold on the transaction amount.""

Essentially I have 10 days to work things out with PayPal. 

At this point, does eBay have impact on any of this? And how exactly would I be able to win this case? I realized I had forgotten to upload tracking info as I paid in store and normally I do this via ebay/USPS which has the tracking info uploaded automatically. However, according to ebay messages the buyer shows satisfaction with the service/items. Can I somehow upload ebay messages to PayPal as proof?

Ebay,"Buyer issued a chargeback, first time this had happened, help!","I logged in to my paypal last night and saw a negative balance and thought “great, what now”. So I opened up eBay and didn’t see any cases, which I found odd. So I looked at the case on PayPal and see the buyer circumvented ebay and went straight to PayPal for “item not as described”.

I sent the buyer and email asking what was up, then checked their feedback and saw some recent “beware! Buyer will issue chargeback!” From multiple sellers.

Fantastic. So I call PayPal and tell them what’s going on and the lady says “oh..they issued a chargeback. It’s out of our hands.” I said what do you mean it’s out of your hands? their feedback shows they’re scamming. She said “yeah I see we’re going after them for too many open cases.”

I then asked “so, will I get my money back?” The lady says “I don’t know..it depends on their bank. It could take up to 90 days” Which is ridiculous, and apparently this isn’t protected under seller protection.

Then tonight I see I’m hit with ANOTHER $20 chargeback fee and if they get it back from the bank, they’ll refund it back to me.

I’ve been selling on eBay for over a decade. 100% feedback, thousands of items and 1000+ feedback so I know this is a rare occurrence, but what can I do in this situation? Would a supervisor help? I’ll be out $64 in total which isn’t the end of the world, but it’s the principal of the thing. If a buyer can simply do a chargeback with no repercussion, what incentive at all is there to even sell on eBay?

I made a conscious decision after this regardless to never sell anything above $100 anymore. I’d hate to think if I sold something expensive.

Has anyone encountered this? What do I need to do? Please help...",15,4,2018-08-13,EBAY,0.058771003037691116,0.9072766304016113,0.03395233303308487

Ebay,Selling two items to same buyer...,"A potential buyer wanted to know how much shipping would be if they bought two items from me.

I wouldn't assume to just add the two shipping as that's for two parcels and I'd be shipping both items in one.

I've combined the weight, and did a draft listing with that info to communicate to the buyer potential ship cost.

My question is this: if the buyer purchases the two items will eBay recognize that it's the same person and combine the shipping? Or should I make a new listing which contains just the two items the buyer was interested in with updated accurate shipping info?",8,3,2018-08-13,EBAY,0.027632327750325203,0.9445047974586487,0.027862904593348503
Ebay,Is this an empty box scam?,"I'm trying to determine whether this is an empty box scam. The details are a bit more nuanced than usual so I thought I'd get some opinions.  The dispute process is working its way through ebay amicably and I'm less worried about that than knowing if its a scam - the dispute is largely going in my favor but there's a small part of me that thinks this might be a legit story and I don't want him to get screwed, so here goes:

1) Buyer with 2 feedback buys a laptop - lack of history certainly a warning sign.

2) I ship USPS priority mail in a priority mail box, so I have tracking. Weight is \~4 lbs, taken at a retail USPS location (I did everything at the post office).

3) Package arrives at buyer's address. Tracking at final delivery stage says box visibly damaged - but nothing more than that. No indication that box is unsealed or without contents.

4) Buyer says box was delivered 100% empty with side flaps open but bent inwards (it would be nearly impossible for the laptop and bubble wrap to have fallen out through this gap). No paper or note inside, nothing. No letter from USPS. So if postman was delivering and noticed the lack of heft he'd easily notice that it was completely empty by peering in the gaping hole.  

5) He sends pics of the box. The box has red ""received unsealed"" and ""received without contents"" stamps. But they are the generic stamps you can buy at walmart (exactly the stamps, to be precise). No stickers or stamps denoting the zip code or post office that received the box in such condition and applied the stamps. Based upon a google image search it appears that the facility that applies such stamps usually identifies themselves in some form.

6) There was some clear tape added to one side that I did not put there.  No USPS blue tape anywhere to be found. 

The story seems very odd to me, but not impossible. That the tracking noted damage to the box gives me pause.  But that might have been a convenient excuse to try to pull the scam and apply some generic stamps. That USPS would deliver a box that is both empty and open at all seems odd, not to mention that they did not mention it in tracking or provide a bag or note to say the content went missing. There is no 'official' acknowledgement at all. That said, my own post office was worthless in providing guidance and I have spent hours on hold on the phone with USPS unable to get through to anyone. Still working on that.

Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated.",9,3,2018-08-13,EBAY,0.05018636956810951,0.9190072417259216,0.030806394293904305

Ebay is a scam, and what stops people from just buying something and claiming it was lost, then pocketing the items. Might as well buy $300-500 items and claim I never got it, then ebay will give me  my money back. Good shit.

Ebay,Am I about to be scammed?,"Hey. So I'm a big user of eBay both selling and buying. The last item I sold was a huge problem I got scammed big time. The buyer was a bidder, co-operative and had all positive feedback and a lot of it. There was lots of fuss so now I'm pretty weary. 

I have more items to sell and I made a new eBay account but I thought no I'll stick to my old one because I have lots of postive feedback that I don't want to lose.



I've listed an DVD box set for £30, it's an item I bought for that same price. It's on auction and best offers, and someone just best offered me £50. £50. 



I am suspicious because of my whole scandal with this other person.  I messaged asking why they would do that, offer me an extra £20, they said they don't want to get involved in a bidding war and has a shop where they resell items. Also their feedback is 100% positive...as was the previous person who scammed me. They've said if I don't want to sell it to them fine, and they've also said they can just bid if I want them to, but bidding and best offering all lead down the same path.

Ebay,Removing a dishonest negative feedback?,"Little back story:

My dad used to sell software a couple decades ago. More than 15 years ago, he bought a shitload of Collector's Editions of a particular game (EDIT: These were bought wholesale straight from the company), and split them up to sell each item individually (the game, strategy guide, soundtrack, etc.) because there was a lot more money in doing that.

Ebay,SPRING UPDATE = Devastating drop in listing impressions.,"Ever since the spring seller update, I've seen a devastating drop in listing impressions. Went from 1.5 million in previous months to less than 400k for recent months. The result is that my sales are down 655 year over year. Here are the two policies that I feel have hurt me. 

30 Day Returns / Top Rated - I've never offered returns and yet I've maintained 100% feedback with 2000+ transactions. Even though I technically am top rated, I'm not getting the listing placement in best match because I don't offer returns. I'm also not getting the top rated badge on my account because I don't offer 30 day FREE returns.

14 Day Requirement for Markdown - Most of my customers like to shop my sales. Ebay has implemented a new rule that an item must be on the site for 14 days with no price change before it can be placed into a sale. What they did not make an exemption for is RELISTED items. So every 30 days my items relist an even though they have been on ebay for months, they are treated as NEW items and have a 14 day waiting period. Therefore, for the 30 days the items are listed, 14 of those days I cannot have the item on sale. This is hurting both me as a seller and my customers. The work around that eBay gave me is that I can use GTC (good til cancelled). The problem with this is that when you use GTC your listings eventually become stale, they don't get good placement, and they need to be relisted as ""sell silmilar"" in order to refresh. 

My point is that eBay is holding me hostage unless I decide to accept returns. They are also making it harder for me to put an item on sale. This is the damage that happens when you make sweeping changes across the board. Small sellers are in a totally different boat from large sellers as are vintage vs. new. There should be different rules that are designed to balance the needs to small sellers with the desires of customers. 

Another month or two of these kinds of sales numbers, and I'll unfortunately have to leave eBay.",7,10,2018-08-17,EBAY,0.1612538844347,0.799811601638794,0.03893448784947395
Ebay,I have taken eBay to Court (in UK),"I have taken eBay (UK) to court and have a scheduled hearing for December.

eBay permanently suspended my account as in I can no longer sell anything - and I did quite a lot, as part of my small business.

The reason for suspension - not meeting eBay sellers' standards, which went above the require level by 0.04% This was only because the IT system I use sold some items which I did not have in stock, so cancellations followed with full refund to customers, yet eBay penalises sellers for things like this (but also many other, like ""item not received"" or ""not as described"" so things which can be very subjective but which you cannot contest as part of these ""ratings"").

My reason for taking them to Court is for breach of business to business contract. eBay has done the suspension but nowhere in their Terms and Conditions it is written explicitly that this can happen in this specific situation.

eBay is of course contesting this and shows some paragraphs which for example do confirm that a suspension can (generally) happen. The problem is, it's so confusingly written and up to a personal interpretation that for an average user it is simply not easy to guess that this could be a possible outcome. Plus, eBay completely does not care about this and does not offer any tools, e-mails, contesting, improvement etc - there is just a sudden ban, which is definitely no fun, especially to those sellers who gave up their jobs and deal only on eBay. There are many other similar stories on various forums.

To increase my chances I have even started crowdfunding on UK's crowdfunder so that I could afford more legal help and even representation (so far I have done majority of the legal work myself). I won't be pasting the link here as this post is not for this intention though but to share the fact that I am trying to take on the big player for their incredibly unfair behaviour towards genuine eBay sellers.",38,5,2018-08-17,EBAY,0.07846954464912415,0.8945173025131226,0.027013150975108147

Ebay,"Ebay says item delivered, USPS says item not delivered?","Long story short. I'm a buyer. I bought a bunch of stuff during one of eBay's 15% off sales. I had 350+ bucks in my cart of different stuff from various sellers, with the most expensive item being 175 bucks, and the least expensive item being 15 bucks, with a few different items in between. Everything went fine except for the 15 dollar item. The seller sent this USPS, with a tracking number. If you look at the tracking number directly through USPS web site, it says it was delivered to an address that is not in my state. If you look at the tracking number through eBay's site, it says that it was delivered to that same address that was not in my state, then, 4 days later, it says that it was delivered to my mail box. There is no movement between those 2 time stamps. It simply says on the 13th it was delivered to an address in California and then yesterday it says it was delivered to me, with no tracking in between those 2 spots. I don't have the item, it wasn't in my mailbox yesterday. I already filed a claim but the seller is being a dick about it. Am I going to get my 15 bucks back on this or is ebay going to try and make me eat it? If they make me eat it, is there any recourse short of small claims court over a 15 dollar item?

Ebay,Would you ask for a return?,"**EDIT:** Looks like my source for the size of the 1st Generation was wrong. So I'll be eating whatever loss this will be.  

To keep things short, I was in the market for a used Moto 360 2nd Generation smartwatch. I found a buyer that listed their item as ""Motorola Moto 360 - 46mm Case Black Leather - Black"" which is what I thought I had wanted. Motorola has produced the following versions:

* Motorola 360 1st Generation - 40mm
* Motorola 360 2nd Generation - 42mm
* Motorola 360 2nd Generation - 46mm
* Motorola 360 Sport - 45mm

Upon receiving the watch today, I check the software version to make sure it has been updated to the newest version (v2.10) only to find out that it is on v1.5 (the newest and last release for the 1st Generation). After reviewing the ad, it does show the MPN for the 1st Generation but has conflicting information with size of the watch face which led me to buy it believing it was a 2nd Generation.

Ebay,"Bought something defective, returned it and seller claims I sent back something different","I paid around $1,000 which is why I need help. I know these cases usually side with buyers but this is $1,000 we're talking about here.

I received the item a day ago through one day shipping as I needed said item ASAP. Upon receiving it I opened it only to find it being defective. I'm not sure what's causing the problem but it will not turn on.

I immediately opened a return request as a item not as described. I cited the ""brand new in box"" from the seller's listing and entered the problem I was facing. He insisted it was brand new and even implied I might be the problem here, user error perhaps. I assured him I was not making any mistake and he was still reluctant. Days later the return request processed and I got a return label.

I packed everything back up even reusing the same bubble wrap the item originally came with. I was checking the tracking the package every day and in about half a week, the package has been returned. Within a few hours of delivery the seller submitted a message into the request claiming I sent back a complete different item. He even had pictures to ""prove"" it. The pictures he submitted were not the things I sent back. He says he will be contacting ebay about this and possibly police/post office.

What can I do? My anxiety is kicking in hardcore and this dude sounds really condescending to the point of me being scared. At the same time is a $1,000 item, I bought it as a birthday present  thus the 1 day shipping. Do I just ignore him and I will eventually get a refund?

I have over $26,000 in sales and a 100% Rating, but over the past few years, I've only sold here and there.

I decided to put up about a dozen listings this summer.  What a friggin' nightmare.  So far, I've had:

- A buyer attempt feedback extortion
- MULTIPLE buyers make offers that I accepted only for them to immediately request to cancel
- Non-Paying bidders on nearly every listing at one point or another with BIN.
- Buyers (*plural*) make offers, I accept, they pay, then minutes later request refunds/cancellations.
- Buyers message me for details, make purchases, then just not pay.
- Potential international buyers get verbally abusive when I either refuse to ship (My listings are for N. America only.) or gripe about how much the actual shipping is to them.
- Returns made (despite me stating I do not accept returns) under ""defective product"" that upon return are perfectly fine.
- Buyers not reading that the listing is a multiple item listing requiring a quantity entered, then buying one thinking they were getting 2 of the item for a ridiculously low price.
- SOOOOOOO MANY 0 FEEDBACK BUYERS

Ebay,Still no refund from eBay,"Following up on my last post from about a month ago, Me and many others purchased an Xbox for $399 with a debit card from someone who scammed us and said that they were stolen so he was going to issue us all refunds which he never did. He didn’t respond to any messages at all and even tried to convince me to buy another one. I opened a case and eBay eventually closed it in my favor and said that I will receive a refund through the eBay money back guarantee. 2 weeks later I never received anything so I called customer service and they said that the refund “failed” so she was issuing me another one. I was told it would take up to 4 business days. One week later, nothing. I call again and they say that they’re issuing me a refund and it will take 5-7 days... 2 weeks later, nothing. I call again and this guy tells me that the refund was processed almost two months ago in June... which was before I even opened a case to get a refund. He told me to call my bank which I did and they said that there has been no attempt to process any money into my account for $399. What do I do at this point? There is no way eBay is fulfilling their eBay money-back guarantee policy and I’m a college student who could use that money lol. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",7,3,2018-08-20,EBAY,0.025498220697045326,0.9293528199195862,0.045148953795433044
Ebay,Is this buyer suspicious?,"A buyer just won an auction for a laptop I'm selling but clearly misspelled the address on it. It's obvious what address he intended, but I'm worried USPS will return the package for undeliverable address. (I haven't shipped it yet)

Ebay,"Sold a NIB phone, buyer tried to scam me. Ebay actually decided in my favor!","I sold a NIB Virgin Mobile Kyocera smartphone for $60. Buyer with 1 feedback, created within the last few months purchased it. Weary, I held up my end of the bargain.

Two weeks later, I get a claim saying that it ""wasn't as described"". I messaged them asking what was up since it was supposed to be NIB. No response. A week later, I message again, following up. No response.

So a week later yet, I called eBay and asked what to do. They escalated the case and said if we don't hear anything within a week, they'll close the case.

A week goes by and still silence, so the case was closed.

Yesterday, I get an envelope in the mail with a ""certified mail"" sticker on it. Inside was a busted up SPRINT version of the phone just slapped inside (no accessories, box, etc). I was thinking ""what in the world...""

Then today, I get an email from eBay saying they've ""decided in the buyer's favor"" and would be withdrawing $60 from my PayPal account.

I called eBay ready to tell them that I want my account closed immediately. I calmly explained that I've been selling on eBay for (literally) 20 years and this new guy was trying to pull a fast one... I tell her the whole story and she asks if she can put me on hold.

Amazingly, she came back and said that she's reviewed the appeal and would be reversing the decision and that I would have the money back in my account within 24 hours.

Hell hath frozen over?

Surprisingly good experience with eBay customer service.

I filed a claim on both eBay and Paypal. eBay reuled in my favor before Paypal decison. However, they claim that the refund cannot go through because I have already opened a dispute on Paypal.

I waited for more days and the Paypal case was closed on the sellers favor! They said that based on the tracking number i have already received the item but it was not the case !

Ebay,Stupid questions from buyers,"I sell prints.   On every listing the available sizes are specified in the item specifics (details) &amp; in the item description.

However, the listings are multi-variation listings with a drop-down selection box for  1) size &amp; 2) media type.

Yet I still get questions like ""What size is this print?""  ""Is this print available in XX size?""

Because of this I even started putting in the item title that is available in X number of sizes (can I be any more clear?).

So last night, I get a message from a buyer about a print.  It's clearly stated the item is available in 11""x14"" inches, 18""x24"" inches &amp; in size A2 (420x594mm) &amp; A3 (297x420mm).

The message:

""Am interested but need the following information. The sizes you have listed...which one is the closes to 24x36 inches? Thanks.""

I considered blocking the guy right then.  I did NOT reply.  This morning I get:

""Let's try this again...sent previous inquiry regarding the sizes of the posters. Asked which of the measurements you list is the actual poster size 24'x36'? Your previous response did not specify. Please provide this information.""

Ebay,"Return advice, am I being scammed?","I listed a mint in box limited edition collectible item I got from a convention. Great pictures and description, the item is as described.  This guy asks me a ton of questions about it, will I lower my price? I reply, No sorry it’s rare and collectable, I’m not willing to lower the price at this time.  Then he asks what’s it made out of? It’s clearly a plastic toy in a cardboard box. I reply, umm plastic..  He buys the item, I ship it right out. 
The auction says no returns. Well now he wants to return it, he says it’s not what he expected. Item is not as described because it has cardboard backing and I said it was made of plastic.  

 it’s a collectable so I have no idea if he opened it or damaged it or just found it cheaper and now has buyers remorse. But I feel like I’m getting scammed.. Do I have to refund him? What can I do? I have perfect feedback and I don’t want the negative but If I don’t I’m sure he’ll just call PayPal and get his money back and Ill be out the $100 toy and the money. 

What can I do? If I call PayPal and explain will stop him from getting his item for free at my expense? I feel like that is his end game. And I’d totally take a return if I misrepresented an item and it was my fault but it’s clear what this item was.

Ebay,Is there any shop on eBay that accepts credit cards?,"It might be or might be not my problem. 

Anyway, I currently have an 35% eBay cash back offer from my bank, but I have to pay directly with credit card in order for that to work. I could use that for a lot of things at the moment, but that seems impossible because virtually every store I visit has PayPal Credit and credit card options greyed out. 

Now, I'm not in the US, so it might be the country problem (but why in that case would bank give that cash back offer in the first place?) or it might be the fact that my account is new and has no previous transactions. Also, my old account got suspended for not paying $44 fee (I sold a thing and then cancelled transaction via PayPal, I was young and didn't like to read the rules).

Changing my password seems obvious, but I'm still confused as to why ebay would let someone have 46 go's at my password, or guessing the security code because they already have my password?

Anyway, sorry if this has been asked before or if it is easily answered somewhere else.

Thanks in advance.

Edit:  changed password to eBay, and edited a couple words.

Edit v2.0 -  Sort of solved it myself by ringing Ebay directly, and resetting my password via e-mail.

When resetting my password via text, I couldn't log in using the new password - hence the reason for a direct call.

Ebay,Another ebay glitch (Top-Rated Seller status is it even worth it),"Got a message from ebay this morning saying that I failed to meet the standards for top rated seller status.

I don't get a lot of returns, but I simply refuse to offer ""Free Returns"" on principle.  I believe that is a pandora's box that will attract problem customers... you know the ""buy it &amp; try it"" then send it back type.

Ebay,Am I covered by seller protection?,"I have recently been seeing a lot of payments from buyers coming with addresses that are clearly for mail forwarding companies.  Presumably these companies are forwarding items to buyers outside the USA as a way to get around the restrictions of sellers that do not ship internationally.

If the payment through paypal lists the mail forwarding company's address as a confirmed address that is seller protection eligible, does that mean that I am covered if the buyer issues a chargeback?  Does the involvement of a mail forwarding company change anything in terms of how the seller protection policies work?

I contacted ebay and spoke with their customer service.  They said that as long as the address on the transaction page is marked seller protection eligible and I have proof of delivery to that address then that is all I need.

I tried contacting Paypal to ask the same question, but I waited on hold for over an hour and eventually had to hang up.  There does not seem to be a way to send them a question about seller protection policies by e-mail, so it seems as though there is no way to get an answer direct from them.

Ebay,Buyer abusing free returns now found selling our item on Craigslist. eBay support won't do anything. Possible scam? How to proceed?,"Sold a $230 laptop a couple weeks ago. Buyer immediately left neg fb on delivery and opened SNAD claim. There was no issue; the item was exactly as advertised and buyer's own photos and claims confirm this. Even eBay support confirmed the item was accurately described and appears to be a remorse return, but they gave us no option but to pay for the return label and appeal for the postage fees on receipt due to policy.

This afternoon, we received a message alerting us our information was on Craigslist. Turns out that this buyer is trying to resell the item locally (at a loss). They didn't bother to take photos, and only use screenshots of their eBay purchase history. These images show the original sale date, item number, tracking number, our name/address, etc. The photo even shows ""Status - You've requested a return...""

We contacted eBay support again, who did not care that the buyer was trying to resell with an open return claim, or that they were sharing our information publicly. 

Why would someone go through the hassle of selling locally for a loss when they could return for free? Is there any reason besides scam? Think the buyer is trying to sell locally for cash, then send back a box of rocks to get the eBay refund, too? Worth noting: the buyer runs a terribly reviewed pill-pushing ""pain management clinic,"" so I won't be surprised if the doc is a scumbag in his personal life.

It's been 5 days since we accepted the return but the buyer still hasn't mailed the item back.

Ebay,should I sell to a known scammer ??,"First, let me say this I LOVE unauthorized transactions cases.  In fact, I pray every single one of my transactions is an un-authorized.  Theory is this:  you don't have to worry about not as described cases, you don't have to worry about paying shipping both ways on a force return.  Un-authorized transactions is very easy:  simply provide valid tracking and you are done.  When a buyer files an un-authorized transaction it voids them of any ebay or paypal claim, let alone a not as described case with their card.

Guy from Israel (feedback score of 11) bought a tablet from me (listed $600 or best offer) probably worth $500-$550, he paid the buy it now price of $600 and my over priced shipping of $130 international.  Sent me a message asking if it can work with 220V (valid question).  Then messaged from a brand new account with 0 feedback asking me to ship it to some place in Delaware.  Then messaged me from the account he bought on to tell me he wants to cancel it.  I responded to his first message and said it works with 220V outlets and he messaged back and said ignore the other messages he wants it.

Ebay,Seller Cancelling Item,"I bought an out-of-print DVD from a seller and paid for it immediately. The seller listed that the item would ship after 1 day of cleared payment, but I waited 5 days (3 business days) with no response. I'm okay with waiting, but when I messaged the seller 2 (business) days after the cleared payment, they never responded. On the 6th day of me purchasing the item (4 business days later), I sent another message asking about when the item would be shipped. They ""shipped"" it a few hours after my sent message without saying a word.

After 2 days of eBay marking it as ""shipped"", they messaged me saying that there was something wrong with the item and that they're unable to ship it to me. They said that they ordered from a different seller to ship it to them to ship it to me, and that that seller cancelled on them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if this is because of seller's remorse from selling an out-of-print DVD for relatively cheap and I was wondering how often sellers order from different sellers to ship things on eBay. It sucks because I was pretty excited for that DVD.

Ebay,HELP with potential fraudulent buyer,"Hi,  


Today I've relisted one of my items on eBay and almost instantly, someone bought it. It was paid through Paypal a minute after that.

When I'm in Paypal, the person doesn't have an account, I can only see his eBay username. Usually, I can see the email of the buyer on the transaction. My worries ? I think that the person might have stolen a credit card and I think that the money could be taken back when card is declared stolen, so I don't want to ship the item, but at the same moment I have the payment in my Paypal account.

Ebay,Help needed after selling an item,I got a set of headphones with my phone and sold them on ebay.  I was in meetings all day at work so asked my housemate to post them 1st class signed for but it was sent 1st class only by mistake.   I sold a pair for my boyfriend on ebay  the previous week as he got the same phone and deal as I did.  I've never sold on ebay before last week so my rating as a seller is low. So the money being held for 21 days is not an issue and understandable.  The guy I sold my headphones to said he hadn't received them and it was 6 days on.  So i asked him if hed check with neighbours etc and I heard nothing for a couple of days then he messaged again asking for help. I asked if he's been in touch with the sorting office checked safe spaces and such and he didn't reply.  I asked if he'd not received it that he'd have to open a case with eBay because I didn't want to just refund money. Anyway today his money cleared and its less that 21 days.  Does this mean he's confirmed receipt or is it a shorter period on pending  for a 2nd item.  I have positive feedback for the pair sold last week but this buyer has left no feedback.  Is there a way of finding out if he has confirmed receipt. Lessons have been learned in terms how an item is sold tracked is definitely the way forward that's if I sell again.  I don't need this worry at the minute with things going on in my life so it's an extra stress I don't need and I'm really panicking that I'm going to be out of pocket with ebay and PayPal fees if I have to refund him.

Ebay,"has anyone had to deal with fraudulent USPS shipping cost ""adjustments"" yet?","I've dealt with this for years with UPS and that's one of the reasons I almost never use them now, instead I use USPS for almost all of my sales shipping. Recently we got a report that USPS was going to start doing automated scanning audits of packages for weight, size, and service discrepancies and back-charge you any difference they found.

I weigh and measure all of my packages and I am familiar with the difference in the various services and specific service packaging. 

Recently ebay sent me a notification that I was being charged for alleged discrepancies. One such was a pair of small items weighing maybe 4lb that was sent regional rate A and labeled as such, yet they claim it was actually a regional rate B box and charged $2.50 more. 

The other which is the much greater concern, was a relatively small item weighing about 3lb which was also shipped in and labeled as a regional rate A box, yet they claim that the service was actually ""usps priority mail"" and upcharged me $45.xx difference. This seems ludicrous, even if I had done what they claim, the difference should have been no more than a few dollars (regional rate A boxes usually ship for about $8-10, and regular priority boxes of similar size and weight maybe $10-15). 

The notification reached me the day after they already forcibly removed the money from my paypal account.
