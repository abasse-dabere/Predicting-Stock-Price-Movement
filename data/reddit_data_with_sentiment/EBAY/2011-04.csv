Ebay,Question about e-bay etiquette.,"So I won an auction, but just realized I need to pay through pay-pal.  I'm waiting on paypal so I can confirm my card, then pay for the item.  Might take a day until I can confirm it, so should I pm the seller and tell them, or does it not really matter?",3,3,2011-04-04,EBAY,0.04009126126766205,0.9232233762741089,0.03668537735939026
Ebay,Is it possible to search for items without pictures?,"As the title suggests, I would like to search for items on ebay that have been listed without any pictures. I could imagine this would be a good (but risky) way of finding bargains.
So does anyone know if it's possible? Even with an external search engine or plugin?
Many thanks!",3,1,2011-04-05,EBAY,0.02082587592303753,0.9182066917419434,0.060967426747083664

Ebay,I need tips to to avoid a scam.,"I recently sold a pricey item to someone ($300). In my listing
I mentioned that only people with X+ ratings could bid but the winner 
only had a 5 rating. I just went with it.

I shipped the item in perfect condition with insurance and signature confirmation. The tracking said the Item arrived already today, but I am starting to get paranoid.

If she doesnt email me or doesnt leave me positive feedback, would it be wrong from me to ask about how it arrived? Or email her asking about the item or if everything is ok?

I ask because i read somewhere about people not leaving rating and then claiming a dispute months later, just to scam.

This is most likely not a scam but I still cant afford to lost those $300.
Any tips?",15,3,2011-04-12,EBAY,0.035792406648397446,0.9218435883522034,0.04236403852701187

Ebay,A few tips for sellers on eBay to protect yourself from the bad buyers out there.,"Ok folks I have been sifting through the posts here and seeing some real interesting stuff so I wanted to throw out a few tips.  
  
""they found in the buyers favor on my case""   
A few things here, Paypal wil ALWAYS find in the buyers favor if you do not provide tracking showing that the item was delivered to a VERIFIED PayPal address. If you cant get a verified PP address dont ship the item. International shipping in most cases will only track your item to the customs department of whatever country you might be shipping to. Do not ship internationally unless you are ok with the risk involved or are willing to pay out the ass for signature confirmation (USPS only has this available on Express international which is rediculously expensive)  
  
""People keep buying my items and now they aren't registered""  
When scammers setup accounts on eBay they almost never are able to keep the account active long enough to link it to a verified PP account. You can set buyer requirements that do not allow people who do not have a verified PP account to bid on your items. if someone is no longer registered on the site (usually this means eBay has suspended them) then you are able to open and close an unpaid item strike imediately.  
  
""Someone bid on my item from outside of my country""  
You didnt setup the buyer requirements did you? If someone bids on an item and lives in an area where you dont ship just invoice them the cost of shipping the item to their country including insurance and packaging materials. As I mentioned earlier international shipping with delivery confirmation is prohibitively expensive. after invoicing them proceed to let them wait for 3 days while they refuse to pay then open an unpaid item case.  
  
""I sent a cancel transaction request because the person was disputing the charges or refused to pay""  
Obviously there are times when things come up and someone would want to cancel a transaction. If it is a buy it now item and they already bought and paid for the same item from you it was probably an accident. Aside from that individual situation almost every other request by a buyer to cancel a transaction (use your judgement) is complete crap. 95% of the time you should open an unpaid item case instead of a cancel transaction. if the buyer recieves an unpaid item strike you will get a refund and it only takes a few unpaid item strikes for an account to be suspended. People scream and yell about not being able to leave neg feedback for buyers but this is how you leave neg feedbac for buyers.

""I think this person is lying about my item being broken""  
PEOPLE LIE some of the cost of doing business is going to be shrinkage and customer satisfaction. when you are selling on eBay your buyers are your customers and your feedback is your advertising. in some situations it is better to take a small hit on your wallet then on your feedback. again this is a judgement call.

""I didn't get my item back and eBay told me to give a refund"" You should never be required to provide a refund on a not as described item until you recieve the item back. If the buyer doesn't have proof of return delivery eBay  and PayPal should NEVER give a refund. And neither should you. if this happened dispute the resolution center case and make sure it is overturned.
  
These are some of the better ones I can think of. Always protect yourself, your rules in your auction are always superceded by eBay rules so make sure you know what eBay's rules are and follow them.  
  
Feel free to ask any questions you might have and I will do my best to answer them.",0,3,2011-04-23,EBAY,0.08456016331911087,0.8892198204994202,0.026220029219985008
Ebay,Having a problem with a seller on eBay.,"Hi guys.
I am a long time ebay user and for the first time a am having a problem in dealing with a seller.
So, I was on a committee at work planning our annual banquet, to be held on April 9th. 
The theme was Hollywood and I contacted a seller on ebay (UK) about ordering Oscar statues from him (cheap novelty ones), asking if he posted to Iceland, which he said was fine. This was on the 8th of march. Having confirmed how many statues we would be needing I sent the seller a request for the price, on the 17th. He promptly replied and I bought the items, telling him I would be needing them before April 9th. The seller takes a couple of days to send me the invoice but I make the payment on the 21. Seller states in his listing that items are always posted within 48 hours.
Then I get a message from the seller on the 29th telling me that he will have the items posted tomorrow...

Then a week passes and nothing is heard of the package, I contact the post office and there is nothing. On the 6th of April I email the seller requesting a tracking no. for the package. The day after I get the tracking no. and after contacting the post company the package was sent with I am told the it wasn't posted until the 6th of April.

The package obviously didn't arrive in time and I contacted the seller asking how this could be solved, as I had no need anymore of the statues and the package was sent out way too late and had not arrived in Iceland on friday (I contacted icelandic customs, that are very efficient, and the tracking status also said it was still in the UK on the 8th).
I get an answer from the seller and he said that he could not be held responsible for this, that there was a delay in receiving payment from me, the the postage cost was more than he originally quoted me for etc.
As I have no need for the items now I am very reluctant to pay for the customs charge and I requested the the seller would pay for the postage back to the UK.

This may be a bit confusing but if any of you have a greater experience in these kind of situations that would be very helpful.",0,1,2011-04-25,EBAY,0.05627179890871048,0.9087600111961365,0.034968242049217224

So, should I, to get a refund for the items, pay for the shipping back to the UK, or does anyone have any comments on what I can do?
