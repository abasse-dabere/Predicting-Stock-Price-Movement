Ebay,"""I missed the auction, can you relist it as buy it now?""","I've gotten that message about half a dozen times in the past weeks. A few months ago when fixed price items had some promotion of zero insertion fees, I reluctantly obliged, just to make a sale. But now fixed price listings have 30 cent insertion fees, I really don't want to get in that habit of unnecessarily listing something as fixed price just because the buyer wasn't paying attention to the auction end time. Especially when people don't even buy half the time. 

So how do you respond to those requests? I don't want to sway potential buyers or sound rude. But 30 cent fees on top of final value fees adds up.

EDIT: Jeez, I'm not looking for sympathy. Just asking how you all respond to a buyer. I'm not exactly a professional ebay seller. Good grief.",9,5,2014-07-01,EBAY,0.043324507772922516,0.9209902882575989,0.03568517789244652
Ebay,Restricted Selling,"So my ebay selling is restricted to not being able to sell because my sister's (who lives in the same house) account was ""restricted indefinitely"". Her account was basically restricted without warning, despite having ~1200 feedback and a 97% positive feedback with all DSR in the 4.8 to 5 range. That info is a little besides the point, but just to show the ridiculousness of this. 


Now I received a message saying I'm also restricted from selling because her name was on my account in 2006. I have been an ebay member since 2002 with 185 feedback (100%) and my DSR's are 5,5,5,4.9. I have tried to call but have basically been told there's nothing I can do because I admit the relationship with the linked account (my sister's) and the only way I could become unrestricted is if her account becomes unrestricted. She has tried to talk to ebay customer service about this also, but was basically told that her account was restricted because of a few low DSR's in the past month, even though her overall ratings are all still high.


I've basically been told that I can't even up my limit to just a few per month or even a probationary period to go through. I don't really sell on ebay often, as you can tell from my feedback and time registered, but the principle of this whole fiasco has me pretty upset. I basically went from having no problems in 12 years to just being shut down and then been told ""that's the way it is, there's nothing you can do"". I think it would be fairly obvious if all of a sudden my sister (who is a power seller) started using my account as the sudden spike in activity would be extremely noticeable, which is why I was hoping to be able even to sell a limited number of items, but apparently that's not an option. 

Does anyone have any idea what I could do or any experience with anything like this? I feel like I've been blindsided into going from having no problems to all of a sudden an extremely restricted account.

Thanks to anyone that can offer some help.",9,5,2014-07-01,EBAY,0.0863589271903038,0.8878171443939209,0.02582385763525963

Ebay,"Open case, refund question ~ Explain like I'm 5","I sold a wrap around skirt to a buyer.  I listed the waist as 36"".  

She gave me Neutral feedback for inaccurate description before contacting me - boo!  I didn't respond to the feedback.  I'd already left her positive feedback.  In my listings I ask people to contact me before leaving feedback if there's any issue.  

She opened a case for ""item not as described"" and asked for a full refund of purchase and shipping ($5 for item, $6 for shipping.)

I sent sent the buyer a message and said, ""Will you send it back with tracking?""

If I approve a ""full refund"" does she get the $11 back and get to keep the item (skirt)? 

Please help me understand.  

Edit - Update -
I requested that the skirt be returned to me with a tracking number.

Ebay,Annoying buyer that is just so... blah,"I have this buyer who just messaged me telling me it doesn't look like the photo and he didn't like the smell of it. The photo is of the product I used to send to him and the fragrant was just a smell and that it was described in the description.

Anyways at that point I replied and offered him a full refund if he returns it and his reply is ""I can't return it"".

So what am I to do at this point? I try my heart out to make it as positive as possible but this buyer isn't giving it back. Our policies states that items must be returned before a full refund is giving and if the item doesn't match the description of the exact photos with angles I took then what am I to do?

Looking at his past feedback there are quite a lot of negatives given to other sellers spread out, and you can see some of the seller replies that he is rude, looks for freebies etc.. 

So I am now expecting him to give my account a nice big red dot and I am mentally prepared for it.

Is there anything I can do about it. It really is the buyers word against mine and as we all know, buyers have the total advantage over the seller at this point and win most of the time.

Why can't I even block these types of buyers in the first place? I should be able to block buyers who frequently leave negatives at the very least.. 

any advice?",10,1,2014-07-01,EBAY,0.043823178857564926,0.9215829372406006,0.034593939781188965

Ebay,need help with potential case (as a seller),"Hi,

I recently sold a Samsung Galaxy S4. The product was fully functional, and had some signs of wear as I stated in the description, but apart from this it was fully working. 

The buyer initially asked me to send it to a different address than the one given by eBay, but I refused, and we agreed to cancel the transaction and he can repurchase it using the correct address.

The buyer messages me 2-3 days later saying the touch screen is not working properly and he wants a full refund. I state that it was working when I shipped it, and after a back and forth discussion I agree for him to return it to me so I can assess the problem and potentially refund him if it's an easy fix. He refuses, telling me there was no guarantee he was getting any money back, calls me an idiot, a retard, and threatens to smash the product several times.


After reporting his abusive tone he is blocked from messaging me, but I am prretty sure he will open a case in a few days.


Where do I stand? I only have 2-3 pictures of the product that I listed and I used for the listing, no 'video' to prove the touch screen was functional. Advice would be great.

I won't waste your time making long introduction so I will go straight to the point. I am creating a mobile marketplace for selling used electronics fast and easy, users will post their products in less than 30 seconds and it will be auctioned for 120 minutes starting with a suggested selling price. 
Due to this, premium buyers (you) can get bargains. These people want to get rid of their products very fast and do not have time to sell on eBay. But you have time and expertise. So instead of going to recycling companies like Gazelle (US), MusicMagpie (UK) we connect them with you so you can purchase their products at low prices and then resell them on eBay to make a profit. This is nothing different from what this companies do; Gazelle buys your product at a very low price and then resell it on Ebay. We are aiming to supply you constantly with products at good prices.

In the future, is it okay to do this with smaller, cheaper items, or should I just factor in a tracking number into the shipping costs in the future, even if the item is only listed for .99 or something?",10,1,2014-07-04,EBAY,0.025636907666921616,0.916740357875824,0.057622674852609634
Ebay,Business opportunity offered by stranger to sell motor homes over ebay. Does this sound like a scam to you?,"Sorry if this post isn't allowed here but it's the most relevant place I could think of. 

I've come into contact with a stranger over the internet who claims to want to hire someone (with good ebay feedback) to sell motor homes for him on ebay. He says he would pay a fixed amount of money + fees per listing of motor homes on my ebay account (through me, he wouldn't have access to my account).

I was obviously sceptical at first as this seemed like easy money. I emailed him a couple of times and asked questions such as why he can't do it himself and his background. He claims to have been selling motor homes for 12 years and has previously had someone doing the ebay stuff for him for the last 4. He says he doesn't have an ebay account and little to no experience on ebay. 

For some reason it still feels a little too good to be true, but I can't think of how I could be taken advantage of here. Am I at any risk doing this? Is this similar to a known scam or am I breaking any ebay guidelines doing this? I've asked for a link to a previous listing but until then I'd appreciate comments on this situation from people.",13,1,2014-07-04,EBAY,0.036606524139642715,0.9331205487251282,0.030272891744971275

Ebay,Seller is requesting I revise my feedback in exchange for a refund after eBay already resolved the case. What should I do here?,"Almost two months ago I ordered an item from a seller, they marked it as shipped, it never arrived. A day or so after the last estimated delivery day I filed a case with ebay and sent off a message explaining the situation and requesting a refund from the seller or at least some sort of info on where my item was. 3 days later I had no response, but I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and sent *another* message, again getting no response after a few days. So I escalated the case to eBay and they refunded me. I left negative feedback for the seller after that because they were so unresponsive.

Now, about a week after all that I got a message from the seller asking me to revise my feedback in exchange for a refund. I responded by telling them that eBay had already refunded me and because they failed to respond to any of my messages I didn't feel there was anything left to really resolve. This is the message the sent in response (they're an overseas seller so the English is a bit wonky):

""Dear friend,

Thank you for your fast reply.

We'd like to refund you,but we need you help us to revise the feedback to positive.

And do hope you can revise asap,because the Request Feedback Revision is very precious,eBay only send the seller 5 pcs when the seller received 1000 positive feedback from the buyers.

If you agree,we will send you the Request Feedback Revision and refund you.

The feedback is very important for us.Your surport and help will keep us moving forward and constantly improving our service.

Highly appreciate for your understanding and help.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Ebay,I'd like to let you guys know of a policy that can help you avoid problem buyers. Reshipping completely nulls Buyer Protection.,"I've currently been plagued with a lot of buyers from the Dominican Republic. Even though I don't ship there, they buy my product and have it shipped from an American service that sends the it directly to their door. 
While some I haven't ever heard from again, a lot use eBay's feedback system to extort partial refunds. 
Even more don't bother researching what they are buying and buy phones that can't possibly work in their area.
They make demands for return shipping which can cost more than the item cost originally.
Some of you might have had problems with them as well.
You can recognize them by seeing some crazy code in the name they use for shipping and if you google the address, you'll see it belongs to reshipper. Most seem to go to Doral, FL.
There are weapons that you can use to avoid problems with these buyers.

You can cancel a transaction with anyone that uses a reshipping service with no consequences to you.
If you see the reshipping code in the name and the address to a reshipping service, you can halt shipment and cancel the transaction and you will be able to get any negative feedback removed.

If someone that used a reshipping service opens a Buyer Protection case against you, you will win that case every single time.
If you can convince them to open a case, do it. eBay will always side with you and this will prevent them from leaving negative feedback.

It's really best to nip it in the bud and cancel all transactions outright, but if something slips through, you have to get them to open a case.
Some of the smarter ones will leave negative feedback outright and try to negotiate a refund for negative feedback revision.
Others will just neg you and move on.
The ones that know of this limitation, will generally word their emails properly so that they aren't technically extorting you.
That's why canceling the transactions before they ship is the best route to avoiding these problems.

Here is an example of a message:
""I BUY PHONES FROM LONG AGO ALMOST 5 YEAR BUYING PHONES ON EBAY, YOU CAN SEE MY RECORD, OF THE 4 PHONES ONLY ONE IS IN GOOD CONDITION THE OTHERS ARE IN FAIR OR POOR CONDITION, HAS CORNER SCRATCH BEATS ON ALL SIDES, WANTS PICTURES? MY WORD IS INVALID, I AM SERIOUS AND I WANT TO DEAL WITH SERIOUS PEOPLE, BUT IF YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS, IS NOT LIABLE. TELL ME AND NOT DISTURB MORE, ONLY PUT NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND SAY GOOD BYE, YOU HAVE THE LAST WORD.""

When offered an exchange or return they replied ""I CAN'T SENT ÍTEM BECAUSE NOT LIVING IN EEUU, I'M LIVING IN LATÍN AMÉRICA.""
and then left a negative feedback.


This is becoming a regular occurrence for me and my team.
I really hope sharing this information helps you guys avoid unruly buyers.

TL;DR
You should cancel transactions with people using reshipping services. The return costs are insane and many don't research what they are buying. They also might try and scam partial refunds. Negative feedback in abundance.",11,11,2014-07-07,EBAY,0.15502165257930756,0.8202541470527649,0.02472415752708912

Ebay,"Sold my iphone over ebay, seller not picking it up at post office","!!Title should say buyer not picking it up!!

Alright well this is basically just to get some answers as to how this scenario might play out.

I sold a gentleman my iphone 4s on June 27th. He paid me through ebay with paypal $290.00 and I shipped it out that day. I didn't charge him for shipping. I shipped it requiring a signature and also insured it. 

The package arrived in North Carolina at his registered eBay address on the 30th, and nobody was home, so the post office says it left a note to come pick it up.

The buyer, a person who apparently lives in China and speaks English as a second language, just contacted me on July 5th saying he still hasn't gotten it and if he doesn't ""get it before July 9th when he has to go back to his country, he'll return the phone."" I listed the sale as no refunds

I responded back to him saying he needs to go pick it up at the post office and he was saying stuff like god bless you, i will go monday, thank you thank you...it was kinda odd.

Anyways, I called eBay to see how this could play out..They weren't much help but the did send him an email in Chinese. 

I am a first time seller, and don't plan on selling many things on ebay. The $290 is frozen in my paypal account because of this. Like I said, I want to know how this scenario can play out..Will this guy end up getting his money and they just send me the package back?

Ebay,"I'm up to -five- non-payers in a row, all on the same item. Am I missing something?","Trying to sell a used video game. It's not especially rare or valuable: around $20~25. I sell in this category a lot and honestly find it to be my *easiest* category that I sell in. It's usually very straightforward.

However, I'm about ready to throw in the towel on this particular item. I am opening my **fifth** UID over it. I give 4 days before opening an UID, and attempt to contact the buyer before doing so. None of the winners have responded to me after winning, and the cases always are open-and-shut.

The buyers have varied. A couple have had feedback (3-20), while the rest are brand-new-made-today accounts. The last listing was a bidding war between 0 feedback brand-new accounts. The bid on the item pushed one cent over my BIN price (this happened in one of the other UIDs as well.) And, lo and behold, when it comes time to actually pay, I heard nothing.

I was googling around a while ago and read somewhere on the official ebay help site that there was a period of 45 days where if the buyer doesn't respond or open a case, they're out of luck and lose the item, but does this mean that I do not have to refund him? Be aware that I do not want to steal anyone's money, but I did my part as the seller and once more, took the precautions for my situation with the inclusion of ""no refunds"" on my listing.

Will I be fucked over with ebay's buyer protection if he decides the last day he wants a refund?",17,2,2014-07-08,EBAY,0.11074493825435638,0.8643195033073425,0.024935560300946236

Ebay,Can't see sellers attached photos? Please help! &lt;3,"Hello! :) 
I'm currently in the middle of trying to buy something on eBay. 
This would be my first buy, but I've lurked around on eBay for a few years. The seller I'm buying the item from is a top seller, but the photos shown of the item are a bit off. 
I'm trying to buy a 34 pc makeup brush set, and the pictures how half a set here, a few more pieces there, a random different brush there, never the full set. I figured since its a top seller I could trust them. But since its my first buy and I am extremely broke as it is, I emailed the seller asking ( super friendly and nicely ) for a picture of the FULL set. Just to make sure. The seller was great, replied back within a day and was also friendly. They said they attached photos, but I can't see them anywhere in the email. So I looked and looked, and finally replied letting them know I couldn't see the photos. So they replied again and said they attached photos again. I still can't see them. I don't know if I'm losing it, or extremely tired or something haha, but I was wondering if I was to screen shot the email, could someone let me know if the pictures are indeed there or not? I just want to make sure everything is as is before I spend any money. Thank you so so much in advance! :)",5,3,2014-07-09,EBAY,0.03821991756558418,0.9109621047973633,0.05081799626350403

Ebay,I got my first negative feedback! By mistake :-/,"It ended up being a mistake by the buyer but I learned some interesting things in the process that I thought I would share. The review said that I denied a refund and told them to sell it on their own to get their money back. It was ridiculous! I always accept returns and refunds. When I first read the review, I figured it was an easy fix/obvious mistake. They never once communicated with me and there was obvious proof of that, so I called eBay. EBay's customer service said ""we are unsure if the buyer contacted you outside of eBay's messaging system, so the feedback stays"". (I used to bank on eBay messaging to save me during some sort of issue with communication, but i was wrong). I had to prove that the buyer made a mistake, which can sometimes be difficult getting a response since some buyers don't communicate at all. I was scared that the buyer would just ignore it and move on, but luckily she replied with an apology! Happy ending, but it was a close call.

Ebay,Forgot to cancel auction. What do?,"Hi r/ebay,

I recently tried to sell a hoodie of mine on ebay. This was my first time selling something, and was recommended by ebay to sell the item over the weekend as an auction starting at $0.99.

The weekend flew by, and I forgot to check up on the auction and someone eventually purchased the item for $1.05, which is obviously a much lower price than I am willing to sell the hoodie for.

I understand that it was my fault to forget about the auction, but I'm wondering what I can do in this situation. I've messaged the buyer asking politely if we could cancel the transaction. He has already payed me the $1.05 + $5 shipping that I listed. He has responded, simply asking if there is anything wrong with the product. I told him that nothing is wrong with the product, but that it was sold at a much lower price than I intended due to my forgetfulness, and that I've refunded his money on Paypal, which I don't think he's accepted. I'm not sure what to do from here.

Thanks in advance for any help!",11,2,2014-07-09,EBAY,0.03550484776496887,0.8839983940124512,0.08049674332141876

Ebay,"eBay sellers, quick question about store design.","Hi,

I posted this on r/Entrepreneur, but just found this subreddit and thought i might get more feedback.

We recently opened our eBay store (in march) and have seen great results. We've gotten over 1,000 sales, became a power and top rated seller, are close to 500 positive feedback ratings, and we're starting to average 300-400 orders a month.

We've been using the default eBay store design. But before we opened our store, I was doing a lot of research, and I ran into a statistic reported by several design sites that said if we chose to redesign out eBay site, our sales could increase by 30%.

http://www.trusky.com/ebay-design-portfolio

This is an example of one of the developers we were thinking of using, and their portfolio. My question is, do you really think that having a professionally designed eBay store can increase your sales? Or have any of you seen your eBay business grow due to a redesign on your eBay store.

eBay also recently introduced their new store layout, where one can add a banner and more brand presence (it looks very similar to the facebook timeline look if you ask me). It generally seems like a more simple design. Do you think this layout update has made the need for a custom eBay store irrelevant?

I'd love to hear your feedback, thank you!",8,2,2014-07-09,EBAY,0.013083526864647865,0.7950525283813477,0.19186392426490784

I waited another week, nothing, so I sent the seller another message, saying that the wait for this is getting ridiculous and I didn't even want it anymore, and just asked for a refund, or I was going to go to eBay's Customer Support about it. 24 hours passed &amp; no word from the seller.

Ebay,"Return on heavy, expensive to ship typewriter","I purchased a typewriter at a thrift store for $12 and sold it on eBay for $135 shipped. The person that bought it bought it off of a Buy it Now in about 4 minutes after I posted the listing. The buyer included a message with the purchase:

&gt;*Please do not include a receipt or packing slip, or any indication of the price paid with this purchase. I must have a tracking number for this item. Please pack well and presentable and ship soon and provide tracking information in a timely manner.*

I thought he was super rude not saying thank you, but I obliged with his requests. I paid FedEx $75 to professionally pack and ship the typewriter (was going to anyways). Per the tracking on FedEx, it was received on **June 10.**

I think he resold the typewriter because I shipped it to a County Clerk's office in Northern Michigan, and because he didn't want the receipt/packing slip/etc.

Anyways, I didn't leave him positive feedback, because I thought he rude, and he never left me feedback, but I thought all was well.

Today (month later to the day) I received this message: 

&gt;just tried using this but it doesnt work, we need to return

I tested the typewriter before sending it. It worked fine. I even included pictures in the listing of it mid-typing. I typed out the words ""tested and working.""

Furthermore, my return policy clearly stated 14 days (it's been 30) and buyer pays return shipping.

How should I proceed? Am I being scammed? Is he going to send me a broken one? If I refuse to do the return and he gives me negative feedback, what evidence do I need for eBay/PayPal to side with me and remove it? At the very least, can I make him pay return shipping?

EDIT: I do have pictures with the device's serial number.

EDIT 2: I sent the buyer a message along the lines of what /u/onlytounsubratheism described. I even got in touch with FedEx to learn how to get a claim going. No response yet.

Ebay,Is fighting for Top Rated Plus really worth it?,"Hey everyone! First let me say that ebay, in the long run, has been good to me.

Nintendo, super, sega, playstation etc. TONS of games!

Like many ebayers, I sell to actually help pay bills and keep my family afloat. 

All that out of the way, I spent the last year aiming towards top rated seller status. I finally acquired top rated seller status about 2 months ago. Ever since then, I""ve been walking on egg shells about my listings and feedback. I've had 2 neutrals and apparently 4 or 5 lower detail ratings for 'item not as described'. Which sucks because up until I received TRS i had perfect item as described. I just now got a neutral feedback which simply said ""Got here fast!"" no other details and it was from a game i sold almost a month ago. Wtf? Its like if people have an issue with the item, they just immediately assume they are screwed. I'm so concerned with maintaining TRS that i'll do just about anything to keep feedback positive. In turn, i honestly find myself stressing out over it. I'm not even leaving feedback anymore. In case someone leaves me some unnecessary feedback i can at least retaliate. Which is sad but its about the only form of self defense i feel i have for feedback issues. 

The real question; is TRS really worth it? I mean, I never had any trouble making sells before but i have honestly noticed an increase in buys and at higher premiums.

Ebay,"Account Limit got raised, good idea to fill it to try to be full time?","Hey Fellow friends just a curious question. 

My 9-5 is stupid and I would like to do eBay as a full time gig. You can list a certain amount of items for free, but then you have to pay the insertion fee. My limit got raised to about 500 items a month or 10K a month. Some stuff I have sold within hours of listing and some stuff has taken about 6 months to sell, but got a pretty good price out of it. I do the usual clearance retail arbitrage, thrift stores, garage sales, estate sales, and do a little wholesale. I have a decent eye for it and have very little loss. I am currently selling 92 things, if I go do some hauls and list 500 things in the next few weeks will my fees be outrageous? I am wanting some opinions and advise from other full time people. Most of my items are BIN. Is there a way of setting up my account to get less fees? What are your thoughts.",9,5,2014-07-12,EBAY,0.02231162041425705,0.9159979224205017,0.06169043481349945

Ebay,Funny eBay item description for a video game,"Here is the description:

""OH MAN GET A LOAD OF THIS AMAZING GAME!  DUDE LET'S PLAY SEGA SPORTS FROM 11 YEARS AGO YO!

Toss that copy of Metroid out the window!  Shred that disc of Wind Waker,  because THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT!!!1!1  College Basketball 2K3 - because tuition doesn't get hiked to fund the Engineering department that's for sure.

Let's face it, this game is an insult to serious gamers but collecting is a dirty job and sometimes we need to just be done with it.  To add insult to injury, the only customers who originally bought this game were ""bro gamers"" who multipurposed their games as beer coasters so it's hard to find a good copy in existence.  Mine is no different but I'm a fellow collector, so I'll give you the real scoop in contrast to posting a stock image and a bogus ""LIKE NEW CONDITION"" in a poorly guised attempt to maximize my next Jagermeister purchase.

1. No manual.  It's not like the target audience even knew how to read, but maybe the guy I got it from tried to roll it up and smoke it or something.  Either way it's gone.  I know this isn't kickstarter but if this auction hits higher than $65 I'll include a hand-drawn game manual (2 pages).  FYI my art skills are sub-par to the stuff my 5 year old brought home from kindergarten but rest assured I will put my heart and soul into recreating what the real manual probably looked like.

2. Case has a ton of shelf wear, dirt, and grime.  Seriously I think there's even a spec of cheeto in one of the crevices (1st photo, upper right), likely a casualty of the previous owner bro gamer's ""munchie night"" after too many bong hits.

3. Despite gross case, the insert is in pretty decent (but not amazing) condition.  There's some minor indentations from the case but no tearing.  There's about a 1mm nick on an edge on the back of the insert (2nd photo, zoom in on left about 2/3 way down the side).  Bro probably never used the case anyway as he likely left the disc face down on his stack of Kid Rock CDs (also not in their cases).

4. Disc bottom looks fantastic, I had to look pretty hard to find 2 extremely minor scratches.  It's possible that this was the only game he owned and just left it in his Gamecube the whole time while he played Medal of Duty 6  Modern Ops Call of Battlefield 1492 on his Xbox.

5. Disc top (label side) has a lot of minor scratches (almost like it was stored in a plastic sleeve).  I've had two copies of this game and noticed similar scratching on the top disc label so I'm a little curious if it's a result of the soft manufactured label material itself.  Very odd though that the bottom looks great but the top leaves some to be desired.  Could be that somebody polished the bottom before it got to me causing this strange phenomena.

Game loads up and plays great, but I'll be honest:  it was a chore to even watch the intro video.  Please somebody buy this game from me so I don't have to sell plasma to afford the ridiculous price I paid for Pokemon Box last week.  I need a new hobby.""

I thought this was pretty funny. Defiantly worth a read.",4,6,2014-07-13,EBAY,0.05877713859081268,0.9093868136405945,0.031836044043302536

I said I had the device for close to 2 years. The item was listed as used. I remarked that there was some damage on the built-in kickstand.

I failed to mention/take pictures of some scratches on the backplate of the tablet. They were minor cosmetic scratches and something that I personally would expect to see on a used item. The buyer was not happy when she received it and asked for a partial $40 refund to purchase a case. I obliged because I felt guilty for not taking those pictures. It was my first listing, and I was not very careful or thorough. Lesson learned. That was my bad.

Fast forward a couple days, she now wants a full refund. She is concerned that the damage indicates the device is frail and doesn't think it'll last as long as she wants it to. To me, this sounds like a change of heart. Based on how she bought it, it seems like an impulse purchase that she's now regretting. I listed the item as no returns but she wants a full refund for it. It sounds like she just changed her mind and wants her money back.

Here's the bad news: I already spent the money. I know that's usually a big no-no, but she saw the device already, told me her gripes, and we settled them. At that point I felt the transaction was over with. An unexpected expense came up and I had to use the paypal funds to cover for it. Times are tough and I only get paid monthly. If she sends it back for a refund now, I would not have the money to cover it until I get paid again at the end of the month.

I'm not sure what to do. I want to refuse the return because at this point I feel like she's just got buyer's remorse and getting the money together for the refund is going to be tough for me. Please advise.

tl;dr, buyer asked for a partial refund because I failed to mention some cosmetic damage on the backplate of a tablet. I obliged. She now wants a full refund days after the partial one but I listed it as no returns. Unexpected expense came up and I won't be able to refund until the end of the month.",14,3,2014-07-15,EBAY,0.12440426647663116,0.8500558733940125,0.02553982101380825
Ebay,Buyer filed case against me and I'm not sure if its final.,"Hello /r/Ebay, recently I sold a $100 amazon giftcard on ebay and received the payment then shipped it to my buyer. Now, normally in my past, giftcards are hard to deal with because people want you to send them a code and then say that you did not ship it which leads to you reimbursing them due to Ebay's terrible policies. When this card sold, I shipped it to him, an account with 475 positive feedback, and two months after, he files a case for not having received the card. I did not ship it with tracking, however the money on the card is spent and I tried emailing Ebay with that. As of today, I am at -$67 in my Paypal after $97 being taken out for Ebay Buyer dispute. Now I get this message, ""We have issued the buyer a refund and closed this case. Please reimburse eBay now.""  
This buyer is a liar, how can I get this to swing into my favor? I have tried reporting him as a buyer and responding to the case but now that is closed. Help is appreciated and further info can be supplied.",9,2,2014-07-15,EBAY,0.03893633931875229,0.9277542233467102,0.03330940753221512

I know better than to depend on eBay money, but I'm in a rough spot this month, and am using it to get through to September (when all will be well again).

Ebay,Haven't received item. What Do I do?,"Hi, I bought a book from Ebay on June 14, seller shipped item on the 16th through USPS and was processed at sort facility on the 18th.  Item tracking hasn't changed since sort facility.  As a note the item is being shipped from the US to Canada, apporx 550mi travel.

I have been in contact with the seller twice but the first time I contacted them I unknowingly opened a case for the item under ""I haven't received my item yet"" thinking that's how you contact people.  He responded to the case file and said that the item was shipped but is still in transit for an unknown reason.  I was satisfied with his response and closed the case file without really thinking about what I was doing.  Just recently I contacted him again asking him to contact USPS and inquire on what is happening with the package, that was 5 days ago.

I don't really know what to make of the situation at this time, it's possible the item could just be delayed at the border or something.  

What should I do?  Is it reasonable for me to ask for a refund since he did in fact ship the item?

Ebay,Do you think I will be able to get Top Rated Seller?,"I've been an eBay member for a little over a year now and have had some pretty steady and decent sales. Only recently have they mentioned the new changes in ""Top Rated Seller"" and they have the full list of criteria and I'm wondering if they allow any leniency on this.

So I have 100% feedback. I've only ever gotten good feedback. And roughly 4.5 stars or above in all the selling categories. I also have a 1.37% defect rate. This was due to an item I had to cancel because of accidental destruction of the item.

I have 0% closed cases without seller resolution.

I have 92% for ""Tracking uploaded within handling time and validated by carrier"".   You only need 90% for this, and it was only one single case that I did not upload the tracking on time and this was because I was away for a few days. But I still meet criteria for this.

My sales amount is $1,464 and I only need $1,000.  I was a bit surprised I had made this many sales in only a year!

However, the single ONE criteria I do not meet is the NUMBER of sales I have had. Up to June 26, 2014 I have only made 73 out of 100 of the sales I'm supposed to make. Since then I've been trying my hardest to make sales, trying to get that 100.

Do you think even if I only get 99/100 eBay will deny me Top Rated Seller? I think I am a great seller, and I strive to be the best. I make sure to do same-day handling or 1 day handling at the most. I pack my items safely and neatly and I provide good prices and detailed information on them. You would also think that I'm actually doing better than the ""average"" seller considering I have made more money in sales than the recommendation it gives.

Ebay,Just got scammed by a buyer on ebay,"Im kinda scratching my head at this and would appreciate some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation.

Background: Im selling some graphics cards that are opened but new, I have sold one successfully no problems - I checked it was working before I sent it, I then sold another one were the buyer received the card and immediately kicked off saying it was broken, one fan didn't work. This gave me immediate alarm bells as it was very very well packed, excessively to say the least and I checked it before sending it  - was working fine. I apologised and said if it had been damaged in the post I will replace or refund and cover the cost of the return postage too.

I received the card back and inspected it, it looked clean and new but on closer inspection I could see dust buildup in very hard to see places, which to me lets the cat out the bag. On further inspection comparing the card serial number to that on the box it is massively different. So basically from what I can tell the guy switched his old card for the new one, kept mine and sent his older one back claiming it was faulty.

I have checked the other cards that are all identical, and all serial numbers matched the boxes. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and even contacted the other buyer incase I had put those cards back in the wrong box, the other buyer said he was really happy with the card and that the serial numbers matched.

I promptly contacted ebay and explained what the situation was, they asked me to sign an affidavit to this, which I have done. 

Then today I get a resolution to the case in the buyers favour. Im a little in shock buy this. Ive been an ebayer for 15 years and never had a negative comment of issue with anyone. Now I have this guy who has basically stolen from me and been allowed to call me in scammer in feedback. Not sure how to progress from here.

Ebay,"Item not as described case decided in buyer's favor, what can I do to minimize the impact?","Hello /r/Ebay,

I'm a casual seller and eBay user in general.  I've been using eBay for 11 years but still don't quite have 100 feedback.  Recently I sold some spare items lying around work to buy a couple new toys to use here.  Among those were two imaging units for photocopiers....basically just some regular maintenance parts for a copier...they aren't exactly cheap and they sold for $250 each to the same guy.  (EDIT: NOTE: these were two separate BIN listings as the imagine units were for different colors, so there are two cases that were opened.  I used the same responses in each case.)

A day or two after they arrive, he opens an Item not as described case.   He said there were “rips and tears all over.”?  I go WTF, immediately reply, and ask if there was shipping damage and ask for pictures.  A few days later he finally responds and says the same thing…no follow-up to my questions so I ask again within an hour.  A few days later he says there is ‘tape all over and I cannot accept the items in this condition’.  He attached pictures, which exactly match my pictures from the auction.  I listed the items as new, because they are…it’s not a freaking collector’s item, it’s a utility item installed by copier technicians.  So as long as the box is sealed and in structurally good condition, it’s new.  No one in their right mind should have any concerns about extra packing tape on the outside of the box (That’s how the distributor sent them to me).  Basically, it seems this guy just bought the wrong part and wants to return it.

So I reply and indicate that his pictures match my auction, I apologize but state I don’t feel that I am at fault, however I would be willing to give a refund as long as he pays return shipping.  He asks for my address (a few days later again), and I promptly start the refund process in the case, as well as send a message on the case with my address just to be sure.

That was last Thursday, and I hadn’t heard anything from him until yesterday afternoon, when he escalated the case to eBay support.  The hell?  I was giving him what he wanted.  And now overnight **eBay decided in his favor** to have him return the item for a refund.  I called them this morning, and the rep told me I was pretty f’d all around and basically I am going to have to wait until the case is closed to appeal and do anything corrective to my reputation.  So this is where I come for advice:

1)	What should I do to have my best chance to make the appeal go in my favor?  The case has a history of this guy changing his story as to the condition of the item, pictures from him clearly showing the condition of the items matching my pictures in the listing, quick responses from me, slow responses from him, and an agreement to refund before the the case was escalated.

2)	Final Value Fees – the eBay rep indicated they would not be refunding these fees since the case was escalated!  That’s nearly $50.  They said I might be able to get those refunded through the appeal.  Is that accurate, and what do I have to do to ensure I get those back?

3)	Bad marks on my account-I understand from searching this subreddit there is a mark just from a case being filed with no current resolution (something about calling back around August 20th?), but once it’s closed in the buyer’s favor, will a successful appeal clear the case as much as possible?  What kind of repercussions are there for these marks?

4)	Negative Feedback-Based on this guy's history, I’m reasonably certain I’m getting negative feedback.  Will having the appeal go in my favor allow for that to be removed?  I have a response written up already (very tactful and non-degrading), should I post that or wait?  I have a few items listed and I've started selling some of my old toys and video game stuff at home and don’t want any potential buyers to be scared away.

Thanks in advance for all your advice.  I’ve heard of crappy buyer horror stories and hoped I would never have to experience one.  And somehow I even hoped that eBay would give a shit about its sellers…sigh.",13,2,2014-07-17,EBAY,0.06296093016862869,0.9054104685783386,0.03162865713238716

Here is that letter and the tripe response from eBay's office.



To whom it may concern,

For 10 years eBay provided a service for me, and in turn has made both you and me lots of money! I'll spare you the details on my decade of selling and get to the crux of this email. Currently I and every other seller on eBay is at the mercy of the buyer. Sellers are no longer reviewed on the quality of their transactions, but on their buyers' whims and moods. In addition, the mechanism to balance the relationship, the resolution center, has become skewed to favor the buyer. As a result, the seller's performance metric has become overly subjective. Furthermore, if delivery is delayed due to weather, this detail is ignored, and a penalty is given to the seller. Put another way, the seller metrics formula requires the following: honest buyers, competent resolution center judges, and reliable delivery. If any one of these fail, the seller is OK. If two fail, the seller is negatively impacted. If all three fail, the seller is removed from the market entirely.

If you are looking for examples of the above issues, then you need to look no farther. eBay's mechanism for checks and balances failed me for the last time as the monthly algorithms made judgement to suspend the account ""lightbluehorizon"". I believe 10 years and $25,000 in sales allots a response from someone higher-up than an automatic algorithm. I ask you these 3 questions: What values has eBay protected by suspending the account? Is this suspension valued to be greater than the cost of another potential decade in income? Finally, was the potential damage to eBay so great that only the permanent suspension of selling able to resolve its threat? Take a few minutes and make an analysis of the account, the resolution center's judgments, and the account's feedback from members. Tell me, in your own words, if this suspension seems correct, and there is no value in continued selling, or if this account fell victim to the flaws in the system, and could still be a valuable contributor to eBay's marketplace. Either way you decide to call it, I'm looking forward to hearing back, as contacting anyone higher up at eBay is difficult at best. Many other long-time sellers share my ""buyer's market"" view. We coming to the conclusion eBay is no longer a fair and balanced trading market. If your conclusions on this account are aligned with mine, your actions will be needed to steer the market's balance back on-track, or risk losing an entire generation of sellers.

Sincerely,

Thank you for contacting John Donahoe. We’ve reviewed your correspondence to better understand your concern, and we wish to follow up with you regarding our findings.

Firstly, I would like to apologize if the information received from our Customer Service teams did not clearly define why this action was taken. I understand that not having the reason for why we made this decision clearly outlined can create uncertainty and additional questions from your point of view. Based on this, I am happy to provide you a complete update regarding our business decision.

I have found that a selling restriction was put in place for your account due to ongoing concerns with your Seller Performance. As you are aware, prior to your restriction your account was showing a Below Standard performance which indicated that your business was not meeting our Minimum Performance Requirements.

I understand that you have concerns regarding the effectiveness of our ability to review the performance requirements set for all sellers within the eBay Community. However, I assure you that the proper attention has been offered to thoroughly review your account and confirm that the correct action was processed in accordance with our User Agreement.

While you noted concerns about eBay not offering the proper considerations for delivery issues due to inclement weather, I assure you that we are fully aware that weather issues may impact delivery times. In these situations, we may look to extend the period of time in which a buyer is eligible for refunds under the eBay Money Back Guarantee. Although weather issues may delay a delivery, it does not absolve a seller from being responsible for this shipment. The extra time allowed for a buyer to file a claim is to allow us to take into consideration the buyer's location, the shipping service used, national holidays, or delays due to circumstances such a natural disaster, national emergency, labor strike, or governmental act. When we extend timelines for eBay Money Back Guarantee coverage, in cases where the seller is responsible for cases opened during such extended timeline, we'll notify sellers with an announcement on eBay.com.

In an effort to open and honest with the eBay Community regarding the standards sellers must maintain to continue selling on eBay, we do make our policy details available through our Customer Support Help Pages. Our Performance Standards Policy can be found under the following Customer Support Help Page: http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/seller-non-performance.html

Recognizing that seller’s needed assistance in identifying the concerns against their customers which impact their Seller Performance, we put the Seller Dashboard in place. Sellers are encouraged to refer their Seller Dashboard to monitor their performance percentages against our minimum performance requirements; thereby having the opportunity to areas of their business which may require improvement. We also offer sellers additional information regarding how to monitor their Seller Dashboard through the Customer Support Help Page listed below:

http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/seller-dashboard.html

As our Customer Support Help Pages outline the requirements to meet our Seller Performance Standards, I can confirm that all the necessary information is provided to eBay sellers regarding the requirements for businesses to participate on the eBay Platform.

Our top priority is to ensure that eBay remains a safe and reputable place to buy and sell. We don't allow members to continue selling on eBay if they're repeatedly unable to fulfill their obligations to their buyers and we are unable to make an exception considering the high level of low detailed seller ratings you received within the Item as Described, Communication, Shipping Time and Shipping and Handling charges categories of your seller Feedback; as well as the eBay Buyer Protection cases closed without seller resolution. Due to the concerns expressed by your customers, we simply could not allow you to continue selling onsite. As such, a selling restriction was placed on your account.

We appreciate your tenure with our site and recognize that a lot of work went into building your business on eBay. Unfortunately, your passion for wanting to continue selling on our site and a decade history with eBay do not allow us to offer you exceptions to our Seller Performance Policy. Please know that this was a difficult decision for us to make. As we must be diligent in ensuring that positive experiences are being created onsite, we have determined your business may not be right for the eBay marketplace and have made the decision to deny your appeal. At this time, you will need to explore alternative avenues for your business partnerships.

Please note that as your eBay account is restricted from selling, you are prohibited from using another eBay account in order to circumvent the eBay action; as stipulated in our User Agreement. Should you attempt to circumvent this action, it will result in action being taken against the account(s) used.

At this time, we feel that your complaint regarding this situation has been appropriately addressed. As the correct information has been provided, please note that although we may read any future correspondence that you send to us regarding this issue, we may not respond.

Nevertheless, thank you for taking the time to escalate your feedback and experience to eBay’s Executive Office.

Regards,

Alynna Wesley eBay's Office of the President

Ebay,Need some advice here - a buyer is demanding that I refund his shipping fees.,"Last week I sold a ""Forge de Laguiole"" knife for $100, and shipped it out via a small flat rate box (~$6).  

A few days later the buyer sent me a rambling email about how I'm Hitler and the knife is a fake. - I told him that I believe the knife to be authentic, and I'll gladly accept a return.  I also told him that I'd be contacting the US importer of the knife and if they believe that it's a fake I'll also refund his shipping.

I sent the listing to the importer, along with some higher quality pictures, copying the buyer on the email.  They confirmed that the knife was authentic.

The seller, who claims to be a previous sales rep of this brand of knife doesn't seem to care and is demanding a full refund (he shipped it back next day/signature required ~$20).

Should I just eat the $25? I have 100% feedback, and I'm sure he'll leave me a negative rating if I don't.

Additionally, just to confirm - there is no way that the knife isn't authentic.  The buyer sent over the specifics of why he thought that the knife was a fake and the US importer addressed them...",5,6,2014-07-18,EBAY,0.10703205317258835,0.8604726195335388,0.032495394349098206

All hardcover and in EXCELLENT, condition with some very very minor edge / corner wear if any. Great for a teachers classroom library, collector, or just someone who wants to read the whole series. I HAVE 3 SETS TOTAL OF OF THE WHOLE LOT. ENTER QUANTITY: 1 AT CHECKOUT. (1 LOT = THE 7 BOOKS). The pictures prove that i have 3 sets. Please ask questions if needed, as titled, pictured, and described."" 

BUYERS MESSAGE TO ME: 

""Hello, I have just opened my package of the Harry Potter books I bought from you and I'm very disappointed to find that most several of the books are not in the condition that you had advertised them to be.

- Book #7 has several scratches on the dust jacket
- book #3 has writing on it
- book #4 has a large fold on the dust jacket of the book
- binding on book #1 is cracked and is starting to fall out
- binding on book #5 is also beginning to fall out.

All of the books have some minor damages on the dust jackets, as well as glue stains on the spines. I can understand minor wear due to shelf wear on the books, although most of the damages I've mentioned are just too severe considering the claims that were made about the condition to be expected of the books. Your store says you accept returns, but I was just wondering if there was any way to fix the situation without sending the entire package back, because I feel like that's not fair since I was told the condition would be very good""


--The pictures he sent me were of some minor fold marks in the dust jacket and little cuts at the tops and edges of the books. There is 1 persons name inside one of the books. This is an international buyer. I just feel the pictures and description do justice for being in very good and excellent condition, so do i tell him to just open a case against me because i have a feeling he will want most of this for free

EDIT UPDATE!! - His new reply after asking him if $20 partial refund is fine
""Thank you for the fast reply, I was just a bit disappointed when I first looked over the books, although the books overall were in very good condition still for the amount I paid for them. A partial refund of $20 would be perfect, I'm sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you, but thank you for being so accommodating of the issue. Thanks again.""

Ebay,Buyer complaining about make up I sent - need advice,"I need advice.

I had a case opened against me from somebody who bought my foundation because it hadn't arrived. She didn't even give it a week to arrive but a case was opened either way without her even trying to contact me first.

I said give it a little more time and today I sent her a message through the case saying had it arrived? She said yes, but she wasn't happy at all because the foundation had some make up on the lid and on the box that it came in so it clearly had been used.

I marked the item as NEW because it was unused but open, I made this very clear in the listing. So it isn't really a surprise that the lid has make up on because it has obviously moved around a fair bit in the post. The box wasn't even meant to come with the item, I never mentioned this in the listing but sent it anyway because I had it. The only make up that I can think was on it was from it being stored with my other make up, so a little bit of powder that will come straight off.

I just want to know where I stand? I think she wants money but I don't see why I should have to give it to her as the item was sold as described and is useable and new, albeit a slight bit messy which is because it has been opened. 

I don't know what to do?! What would you recommend? This is the first problem I've ever encountered through everything I've sold. My feedback is currently at 100%

Ebay,How to get rid of Java security warnings and prompts during 4x6 label printing!,"I've had a few requests now for this info.  It is possible to get rid of the Java security prompts completely!  Keep in mind this potentially opens your browser to java security exploits / malware.  If you don't feel comfortable with this, then don't do it.

Its been a while since I've done this, so its possible I missed a step or two.  Give me your feedback and I'll edit this post as needed.

Alright.  I'll keep this somewhat brief and assume you are reasonably adept with windows.  If you get stuck, feel free to shoot me a PM.  The instructions are assuming you are using Chrome as your browser.

To fix untrusted security warnings, frequent java hangs and crashes:

1. UNINSTALL Java 7.x completely (Its crap. Ver. 6 is stable)
1. Install Java 6 release 45 (Runtime environment, NOT the SDK!) from here:  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/archive-139210.html 
1. Create or modify shortcut to Chrome on desktop to include ""--allow-outdated-plugins"" command line parameter.  Should look like:  **""C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"" --allow-outdated-plugins**
1. Open Java Control Panel.  Go to the advanced tab, and expand ""Security"".  Find the Mixed Mode Security Verification, and disable it.

To get rid of allow access to printer prompts:

1. Run Wordpad (Not notepad!) as Administrator (right click).
1. Open C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\lib\security\java.policy
1. Add this line to the end of the file: **permission java.lang.RuntimePermission ""queuePrintJob"";**
1. Repeat for C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\lib\security\java.policy if it exists.

These should get rid of the prompts entirely if done correctly!

EDIT:
If you ever get a prompt from Java to update, decline it, and disable automatic updates.  You want to stick with Java 6 release 45!",3,11,2014-07-20,EBAY,0.07213269919157028,0.9003746509552002,0.027492588385939598

Ebay,Looking for a little advice on auctions performing poorly recently,"I recently became the manager of a store with a large library of extremely rare and expensive photography books, that operates on Amazon, our own .com, and with a heavy focus on 100 weekly eBay auctions with a ""top rated seller"" rating.

Once the summer started, our sales dropped off dramatically, from yielding thousands of dollars a week before the summer, to tens or hundreds of dollars a week in the last month and a half to two months.

We make sure to post 100 titles that haven't been on auction in weeks or months, at extremely competitive starting prices, we have over 1000 titles available for ""buy it now"", and we send a newsletter out announcing sales and our weekly auctions to around 1500 people that performs statistically higher than the industry average.

I am fairly new to this business, and my boss has been doing this for over 10 years, but neither of us can figure out why we suddenly aren't making any money.

Ebay,how to increase visibility?,"i have been trying everything to increase the visibility of my items with only temporary or no luck. i list about 100-120 items a week, and a good week (where my items are being seen to a reasonable degree) would result in about $500 in sales. lately i have not even been cracking $200. i know this is because, when sorted by ""best match,"" my items aren't showing up until dozens of pages in, by which point most buyers just stop looking.

i have tried using ""sell similar"" rather than ""relist"" as new listings seemed to show up higher in the ""best match"" sorting than relists. this worked for a couple of weeks but has since petered out. 

i have tried listing a handful of items at 1 penny starting bid, and hoping users check out my other items from there. again, this worked at first, but now i'm ONLY getting bids on the penny listings. one guy recently got 7 different items from me for a total of $7. 

i switched to an ebay store, which does save me a small amount in fees, and has a few useful tools. i had hoped the ability to ""sell similar"" en masse would help, but it doesn't seem to have done anything. simply having a store doesn't seem to make a difference for visibility either.

does anyone know how this ""best match"" sort chooses which items to show first anyway? i'm hoping that it doesn't come down to ""be a drop-shipper selling 10,000 fixed-price brand-new items per week."" what else can i do to make sure people actually SEE my items?",15,2,2014-07-20,EBAY,0.030875515192747116,0.9098538756370544,0.05927062779664993

Ebay,Any way to manage multiple accounts at once?,"Hey guys, bit of an odd (maybe not) question for ya.

  I do listing on my own for random stuff that I want to sell of my own, as well as professionally for items I buy to list, and also list things for my friends to sell. I manage these through multiple accounts online to keep my taxes and money and everything more simple and segregated, however business is starting to pick up more (yey!)

   My only problem with that, is that throughout the day I'm constantly switching out between accounts and while the selling manager having them linked is helpful, it's still a lot of wasted time, and annoying time, signing in and having them all to switch between. 

Do ya'll know of an extension with Chrome or otherwise to help with this? Some form of a logged in account selector? 

I know I can just use multiple browsers and stay in that way, but to be honest having 3+ browsers open isn't great especially since they all treat the site and listing (especially photos) differently.

Ebay,You are no longer covered by eBay Buyer Protection?,"I won an auction for an item from a seller with a 99% rating. A few days later I checked my shipping status only to notice that their rating had gone down as people were reporting that the seller wasn't shipping items out. Today is the first estimated delivery day for the item and the seller currently has a 67% rating due to the massive increase in negative ratings.

Hopefully this is just due to having to wait a bit longer, but I went to try and ""resolve a problem"" due to assuming I got scammed and I was greeted with a ""You are no longer covered by eBay Buyer Protection"" message.

A quick google search didn't give me any definitive answers.

The only things concerning my account that might make Ebay decide to mark me as suspect:

Ebay froze my account with a MC999 ban not long after I created it. It was unbanned the following day after proving my identity. When this happened I had only made one ""buy now"" purchase, won several low denomination auctions, lost even more, and one item over $100. Payments were always made promptly.

Paypal limited or froze my account twice to also ""prove my identity."" During one of those freezes they suspended payments and one seller failed to respond to inquiries so the payment was reversed. I tried fixing it, but the sellers Customer Service was incredibly incompetent so I decided to live with being banned from bidding on their items after spending several days going in circles with them.

One seller refused to ship an item and tried to cancel the auction after it ended. Despite denying their request to cancel, they refunded me anyways.

So, anyone know if this ""You are no longer covered by eBay Buyer Protection"" is just a poorly worded message given to buyers if they try to report a problem too soon?

And yes, I've sent multiple messages to the seller without a reply.",2,2,2014-07-21,EBAY,0.27341046929359436,0.702424168586731,0.024165315553545952

He also implied in the case that he both installed cables and didn't install cables (if you try and install them incorrectly it can break the shifter).

Ebay,Question about PayPal and dealing with a persistent customer (I'm a small time seller and this has never happened before). Possible scam?,"About three days ago, someone bought something expensive from me (roughly 11 PM). I waited until the payment had been processed (around 7 AM the next day), and then shipped the item (around 9 AM) on my way to work.                   


When I got home from work (4:30 PM) to add the tracking information I found that the buyer had filed a claim against me on PayPal under ""never received item"". I gave PayPal the tracking number and they're still reviewing it.                 
I got on and the buyer had sent me several messages asking when I was going to ship the item. I told the buyer I had shipped the item in the early morning, gave them the tracking information, and said that the item would most likely be there in 3-6 days. The buyer told me that's not good enough and that it needs to be there in 2-3 days, which they neglected to tell me before I shipped the item.                 


Since then, the buyer has been writing me every 4-6 hours asking why the package hasn't arrived yet.

Ebay,Could use some help regarding the August 20th update,"I have a small ebay store and do about 100 sales a month.  When the new performance standards kick in on August 20th I'm going to be below standard.  I'm right on the borderline and was hoping to raise it before the 20th but that doesn't look likely right now.  I'm not concerned with top seller status, just keeping my ability to sell.

Now I did receive the email a while back stating that I would be protected through March 20th 2015.  That caveat to that was that I have less than *""400 or more transactions over a 3-month period""*.  But I don't know what 3 months that is referring to.  3 months prior to that email?  3 months prior to August 20th?  Any 3 month period over the last year?

Ebay,"Is there any ""guidebook"" or document in writing that explains what ebay's policies are with regard to user feedback ?","I'm a seller and the few times I try to get (what I perceive to be) unfair comments, usually negative, I get shot down (after they waste 15 minutes of my time on hold).  

The customer service representative will generally make comments like ""Well, there's nothing present that goes against our guidelines...yada yada yada...""

Are there any good guides out there, or general outlines, for sellers to try to get rid of improper feedback from buyers?

Presently, I have one in which the buyer just left negative feedback, without ever contacting me or attempting to get a refund.  How do I get rid of that ?  Can I ?

I have another one that is presently ""pending"" in which the buyer opened a case, sent the item back (as I requested), and then immediately escalated the case before I could actually refund the money.  Supposedly, ebay says that I have 24 hours in which to do this - and the buyer escalated after about 20 hours.  (Got the item back 12:30 p.m. Monday, they escalated about 9:00 a.m. Tuesday).  Ebay immediately ""ruled"" in their favor, and then I subsequently got negative reviews from the buyer commenting on my unwillingness to pay their shipping costs.  This is not fair !!!  Currently, I have this ""on review"" with ebay.

This ""24 hour to refund after item received back"" is apparently one of the policies that they have.  I only learned about it because the customer service rep kind of blurted it out when I was arguing with him and screaming at him to remove the negative feedback.  THAT'S the type of information in some sort of guidebook, outline, crib sheet, etc., that I'd love to see or get if it exists.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return item because it isn't as described but is refusing because she has to pay postage cost?,"I sold a bottle of foundation on eBay which was open but unused. The woman opened a case within a few days of auction ending because she hadn't received the item. I could tell from the start she was pretty fussy, because she didn't even message me or even give it a chance to arrive and just straight up opened a case.

Anyway, a week later I message her and ask if the item has turned up. She tells me it has but she is really unhappy as the bottle shows sign of use because there is make up on the lid and on the box. I never even listed the item with a box but I sent it anyway because I had it, I also told her there was foundation on the inside of the lid because the bottle was OPEN and had been moving around.

She basically kicked up a huge fuss and I told her she could return it. She asked me if I was paying return postage to which I had a quick look at eBays policy and seen that the seller has to pay. She then gave me a big lecture and told me I was the one who had to pay because the item was faulty, so I told her if that is how it works then I'm more than happy to pay for it.

I spoke with eBay on live chat just to double check and they said I didn't have to pay because I don't agree with what the buyer is saying about the condition of the item. The buyer messages me a few days later with the tracking info for her returning my foundation so I told her thanks for that, but I've been told I don't have to pay postage cost and she shouldn't expect that. 

She messaged me back saying how I was a bad seller, how she has spoken to eBay and they are showing all the pictures to team manager because it is appalling and then she told me she is keeping hold of my item for another 8 days at least but she wants a refund.

I'm really confused, and I'm sorry if this is all confusing. Can she keep my item if she wants a refund?

Ebay,A seller agreed by email to refund the shipping on an item but now refuses after I paid.

At first she lowered the price, but not to $40 but after multiple re-postings without a sale I emailed her again asking if she would reconsider, and she agreed. But she had some story about how eBay was going to charge her to change it so she would just refund the shipping (only $5). So I went ahead and bought it and she never refunded the shipping. The first day I checked in, and she said she would. The second day I asked if she needed help, and she said she didn't and would refund it. The third time I emailed her she said she wouldn't refund me unless I gave her feedback. I hadn't gotten the dress yet and said I wouldn't and that she shouldn't hold a refund ransom for feedback. The next email (today) I said that it had been so long that it was looking like we weren't getting anywhere and it was time to contact eBay. She replied she would send it today. Then, without any response from me she emails me accusing me of threatening her, and that she thought she shouldn't have to refund because it cost her so much to ship it and it was only fair for me to pay shipping. I replied that I honestly would not have bought it if it wasn't free shipping and if she hadn't wanted to refund the shipping she shouldn't have agreed. Now she emails me saying that she contacted eBay and I have to return the dress and pay the return shipping myself. I honestly don't want to try to return the dress because I definitely don't want to pay for shipping again (that would be twice I've paid when I thought I wouldn't have to pay at all!) and I'm worried she won't give me a refund or will do something fishy and I'll have no dress and no money. I wouldn't mind sending it back but I'm nervous about it and I would hate to have paid a bunch of money in shipping just to get a bad experience with a difficult person. I've tried really hard to be super civil and polite and she always replies yelling in all caps and changing her story or replying to the same message multiple times with opposite responses and it's stressing me out.

Ebay,Questions regarding placing store on vacation mode. Getting contradicting information from google and ebay customer service,"Ok, so a little background on me. I am currently Top Rated with a store subscription and about 500 active listings. I started casually selling personal things in 2009 but really ramped up efforts this past December. It's been pretty rewarding with around $5k-$6k average a month in sales. But this summer (my first summer selling) has been brutal with a drastic drop in sales. Pretty much from May 2nd to today, sales have been cut in half .. this month, even more than 50%. So I have decided to take this opportunity and go visit family in Europe for the month of August. 

I started researching what the best way to handle the store would be and found quite a bit of information on ebays community forums. Some people raved about placing the store on vacation mode and returning home to great sales and others suggested completely hiding your listings so nobody is able to purchase anything. They claimed that although they put their stores on vacation mode without hiding their listings, and a banner appeared at the top of all their listings letting buyers know that there would be a delay in receiving their purchases, they returned to their stores after vacation only to find that they would lose Top Rated status due to shipping times while they were away. 

This is confusing. If I place my store on vacation mode and keep my listings active and a buyer sees that I am away until a certain date but still chooses to make a purchase, I risk losing TRS because of shipping times? You would think that if a store is on vacation, the shipping times wouldn't matter. Again, if a buyer sees that a seller is away and there will be a delay in receiving their purchase and they are ok with that, why would I get punished as a seller and risk losing TRS? 

So I called ebay to get a straight answer. I was lucky and landed a US customer service rep .. but I don't think this girl had a clue. She insisted that when a store is placed on vacation mode, NOBODY can make a purchase regardless of what option you choose so there was nothing to worry about. I told her that she was mistaken and that only when you completely hide your listings are you sure to not have sales and that if you choose the regular vacation mode, buyers will still see your listings and will be able to make purchases. I even read this part of ebays policy to her but she refused to accept it .. 

To turn on your Store vacation settings:
1. Click the Messages tab in My eBay.
2. Select the Change settings link on the top right side of the page.
3. In the Store vacation settings section, select Turn ON.
4. If you'd like to hide your fixed price listings and prevent buyers from making purchases from them while you're away, select Hide and block purchases from my fixed price listings.
5. If you'd like buyers to see a return date, select Display a return date, and enter a date in the box provided.
6. In the Message to display on your storefront section, edit the default   text displayed in the textbox if you would like to customize it.
7. Click the Apply button.

Am I missing something here? Despite researching this for a week, I am still unable to get a clear understanding due to such contradicting information. Can anyone offer any solid info/advice? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",7,3,2014-07-26,EBAY,0.15706545114517212,0.8180617690086365,0.02487282082438469
Ebay,"Can someone please explain to me how the ""Top Seller"" Fee discount from 10% to 8% works.","Hello, 

I just achieved ""Top Seller"" status as of July 20th.  If I understand correctly, all of my items should have a final fee of 8% instead of the standard 10%.  But, when I look at the individual fees, they're still at 10%.  

Reading over the information provided a few times, it makes it seem like they could give you a 2% discount as a lump sum the following month (i.e. If you owe $1000 in fees, they'll give you $200 back)

Personal preference, I'd love to know my price point prior to listing my auctions.  

So what exactly do I have to do to get this fee reduction?  Do I need to both have a ""Top Seller"" status at the start of the period (July 20th) AND at the next period (August 20th) in order to get the discount?  Will all of my July20-Aug 20 auctions be discounted, regardless of whether or not I keep the Top Seller status the following month?  And, lastly is there any way I could get that fee just reduced on each individual auction, so I don't have to edit all of my sales speadsheets the following month?

Ebay,Alternative to ebay...its a new online marketplace with a different niche!!! ;),"Hi,

I am new to reddit, but I started an online marketplace that is alternative to ebay, that would help sellers sale their items...and for buyers to get a GREAT DEAL!!! ;)

The website is https://www.atmomshouse.com/. As a seller, I understand it could be frustrating if you could not sell items, and be stuck being charge for those fees. On my website there is no fees unless, you sell your items. And the listings are free. 

As for the buyers, you are able to set the price that you want to pay and not waste time. Why sit and wait for a deal...when you, as a buyer, could get a deal that you want!!! ;)

But my site is not an auction site. It has a different niche...where my focus will be offers that is made to you, the sellers!! As a seller, you are able to set the prices that you want and to MAKE A DEAL!!! I also attached a video tutorial for the Sellers and Buyers. If you have any questions or suggestions, let me know? I am open for it!!! ;) 

Thank you.

Ebay,Question about an opened eBay case,"I listed and sold a Pan's Labyrinth  BluRay in the category ""Genre:	Foreign, Sub-Genre: Spanish"" and a case was opened against me:

July 11th
The buyer opened a case: Item doesn't match the description
""THERE IS NO ENGLISH AUDIO ON THE BLU-RAY! ""

July 13th 
My message to the buyer:
""Sorry you are not satisfied with the purchase. The film Pans Labyrinth is a spanish film and there is actually no english version. If you would still like a refund please return the Blu Ray and I will refund the purchase price.""

July 24th 
Buyer's message:
""I am not satisfied with that decision of the refund will be the item only and will not include the shipping cost as well.""


I could pay shipping both ways and solve the issue now, but it doesn't seem completely fair since in my opinion the customer made the mistake. Is it worth handing the case over to eBay to decide? or should I pay the shipping costs and take the loss?


Update:
I took it up with eBay, they gave the buyer a refund, and decided not to count the case in my seller performance evaluation. win win. 

eBay opened a case because of an issue with an item purchased from you. We reviewed the case and have decided to issue the buyer a full refund of $10.18. The refund includes the purchase price plus original shipping. The hold on this PayPal transaction has been removed.

Ebay,Regarding refund policy. Need help,"Good Evening,      
  I need some guidance. I sold a lightly used unknown smart watch on ebay just recently. The deal was no refunds and contingent on that the watch works which it does. During the week I used it, it functioned properly - telling time and connected with my mobile device.    
  The buyer is now asking for a refund because the company mobile app and update software is not working towards his favor. I don’t like taking refunds due to inconvenience and the fact that the buyer actually messed around with the product, especially if they are saying the update program is not working who is to say the device isn’t messed up now. How can I handle this situation? I don’t want to be the bad guy but the watch was perfectly find and I said no refund. Thank you.

Ebay,Mobile Phone - I think im about to be scammed.,"I think im about to be scammed, or something is not quite right at least. I sold an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S4 for 220 last week, only to find the buyer has opened a case claiming ""Item not as described"".

I know people advise against using ebay for phones as there are a lot of scams, but no one was interested locally (Gumtree etc.) I took precautions - only selling to buyers with a proven history and good feedback, using paypal etc.

The buyer claims they have contacted their provider and that the phone is ""Black listed"". I know for a fact it is not as it was working when i had it.

Does anyone have advice? I dont want to issue a refund for fear of receiving a boxed up lump of rock in the post. Or could the issue be with his provider/service plan etc?

Ebay,Ebay Double-dipped my seller fees,"Last week my sister told me my seller fees for June were taken from her personal checking account. I called Ebay, and after being disconnected numerous times, was told that yes, this was their mistake. I was told that if I paid the original amount for June (approximately $137) and paid the accumulated seller fees for July (another $75), they would expedite the reimbursement to Paypal. I was told this would take three days.

Three days later there was still no money in my Paypal account. I called Ebay and was told that someone would get back to me within 24 hours.
Nobody did.

Two days later I called again, and again was told that someone would get back to me within 24 hours. Nobody did.

When I called again, I was told that the billing department had decided to not release my funds until July 27th.
So effectively, my sister and I have both paid the Ebay sellers fees for June and I have paid the seller fees for July though they are not due until August.

I have recordings of all of these phone calls. Ebay admits they were not authorized to charge fees against her checking account. They know she lives on Social Security Disability income and that her medical insurance premium was due July 25th.

Has anybody had Ebay double-dip their seller fees or is this the result of incompetence?

My sister has degenerative disc disease, is in constant pain, and will need back surgery soon. She left the house angry and in tears last week. She will not tell me what she did to get the money to pay the insurance premium.

Ebay,Sending an airsoft rifle to Ebay's Valet program,"Hello all,

I was considering sending in two of my airsoft rifles I no longer use to Ebay's Valet program. However, looking through their FAQ on what is excluded there is:

&gt; 19. Firearms, weapons, and knives/ Police and Military paraphernalia   – examples include pepper spray, replicas, and stun guns (military items), air rifles, air pistols, pellet guns, or pop guns that are greater than .25 caliber (toy guns and kitchen knives are acceptable)

As written, would you believe that airsoft rifles are or are not included in this? Airsoft rifles use plastic pellets weighed in mm (28mm, 30mm, etc) and not a caliber. Also, air rifle/pistol is not the same as an airsoft rifle/pistol. My worry is that the person selling this may not know this distinction or that I'm not reading the exclusion correctly myself and I'll simply have my item returned minus $10.

I was hoping someone here would be familiar with selling these types of items before I messaged Ebay directly. Thanks for any information.",3,1,2014-07-28,EBAY,0.027145350351929665,0.9341521859169006,0.038702476769685745

Ebay,Got neutral feedback on antique -- buyer thinks it might be fake -- do i do anything?,"Hello,
I am currently cleaning out an estate that includes a large amount of world's fair memorabilia.  I sold an item for over $300 and sent it out priority with signature required. Check my feedback today and have a neutral saying ""the jury is still out - I have my doubts"".  The thing is, I have no way of proving it is what it is, short of taking it to a world's fair antiques appraiser or something. it didn't come with a certificate.

personally, i think it's real. it's heavy cast iron and has the right markings on the bottom, and has patina and a bit of rust on the inside. it is in incredible shape for its age. and given it came with a bunch of authentic items from the same collection--if it's a fake it fooled that collector, and probably the ebay dealer that it originally came from.

The buyer did not message me and has not requested a refund, but if she did I would gladly give with return of item. as of now i don't have a defect but it says ""as of July 28"" so I guess I will be getting a neutral defect when it updates.

I don't want to lose Top Rated status over this.  Edit: if I understand correctly, I can only get one defect on each sale. so this would be my third defect in 1 year, giving me a 0.92% defect. Which wouldn't lose me top rated, but it's getting uncomfortably close.

Ebay,"I made a rookie seller mistake, was I just screwed out of my money?","So I put up a OnePlus One invite code up for auction, and it ended yesterday. I stated in the listing that once the auction was over, the buyer needs to message me their email so I can send the invite code. 

The buyer did just that, however I made the mistake of sending the invite code before waiting for him to pay. Just a matter of not thinking straight. I've checked my OnePlus account, and the buyer has redeemed the code, but has yet to send payment on eBay. 

I know an unpaid item case will open automatically after 3 days of not receiving payment, but that won't be helpful to me, because even if I win that, it'll just cancel the transaction and refund me any fees, but that won't change the fact that he has the code and I haven't been paid.

Ebay,Please help me take the best course of action!,"Hi, just yesterday I purchased a Samsung Galaxy s3 off eBay to use for Verizon. Unfortunately, Verizon couldn't get it to activate to my account.

Here's where it gets tricky. 
He said the only way he would refund it, is if I send the phone back with the sim card I tried activating the phone on. He stated that if the phone activated for him, and didn't give him the same problems it's giving me, that he would refund me the money. If the phone acted up for him, he was going to send the phone back to me and deny me a refund claiming that I tampered with it or dropped it, which is not the case at all. I've already opened a complaint with ebay buyer protection just in case he tries to screw me over. Did I do the right thing? Is there a different course of action I should be taking?

Ebay,"I am locked out of my account due to registration problems, but have a really weird problem that I cannot figure out.","So I have two ebay accounts accidentally.

I asked him if he could send a code or give me my money back about an hour ago and no reply so far. (Mind you he could be busy, but he was extremely quick to reply to other messages.)

Ebay,Ebay pick-up - best way to arrange (as a seller),"I've only sold via postage so far, for a few different reasons but mainly because I don't want to have to arrange a time for someone to come to my home to pick up an item. It all seems like too much trouble. I don't want my ebay activities to slip into a mire of ebay messages and missed appointments. I also don't want angry customers aware of my address. Not that I should have angry customers, but you know how people are. 

But I'm getting to the stage now that I'm listing items that have expensive postage and as such arranging a pick up is starting to make more sense as it will probably allow me to sell items faster (in some cases) and will allow me to make more profit (in some cases). 

I have a potential buyer of a fairly large item that I'd like to sell as it's been listed for several months that has asked if I do pick up. I'm finally ready to say yes, but before I do I'd like to know the best ways to go about handling a pick up - given that I have zero experience. 

I called Ebay, didn't help. So if I could ask a few questions here, and if anyone could let me know of any other considerations that would be great:-

And to be clear, this is all from the sellers perspective that I'm asking...

- If an item is listed as having free postage, should I give a discount if someone picks up?

- Should I receive payment by paypal or cash? 

- How do I get ebay / paypal protection should the buyer want to claim that they paid for the item but didn't pick up the item (when they did pick it up)

- Should I ask the buyer for a signature? If so, what should be stated on the paper they sign?

- Should I arrange pick up at my home, or at a meeting point (Craigslist style)

- If I receive cash should I tell ebay that I've made the sale so that they can take my profit?

- How successful is arranging by pick up in your experience?",35,1,2014-07-30,EBAY,0.07459457963705063,0.8984599709510803,0.026945464313030243
Ebay,Is Ebay down for everyone?,"Its not working for me and tried going to sites like downforeveryoneorjustme.com and some say its up and some say its down. Need to print some labels

Ebay,Reasonable expectations for shipping from Japan to the US?,"I bought and paid immediately for an electronics lot (valued at roughly $400) from a Japan seller on 6/21.  The item was shipped on 6/23 and tracking provided, which was last updated on 6/25 with no changes since then.  The estimated delivery time was 9-21 business days, which has since passed.  I've had small items take over a month to ship from Japan and I was patient because they were cheap, but this is a rather expensive item.  Any suggestions on how to proceed?  Do I keep waiting, or start thinking about retrieving my money if the item was lost?  Thanks for any insight!",8,5,2014-07-31,EBAY,0.06446877866983414,0.8611505031585693,0.07438069581985474
Ebay,Feedback etiquette as a seller?,"I've read around and see conflicting viewpoints on this... I recently sold/shipped an item that will take about a week to be delivered. Of course the buyer has already sent PayPal payment and it has cleared.

Is my feedback as a seller solely based on their prompt payment? I ask because my instinct is to wait and see that it has been delivered as intended and the customer is happy with the product.

I don't have any reason to doubt the buyer other than the fact they have only 1 previous purchase on record. However, I don't want to run the risk of being scammed by them and then see that my positive feedback remains. How does a seller deal with this possibility? eBay has some 'buyer guarantee' that seems to take the side of the buyer by default if something should go ""awry.""

Then again it turns into a stand-off where it's seen as passive-aggressive to not leave feedback first as the seller. I don't want to be rude about it, but I also want to ensure the entire delivery and receipt is confirmed by their feedback first.",11,5,2014-07-31,EBAY,0.06446804851293564,0.9031177163124084,0.0324142724275589

This was my chat with an ebay representative after creating an account that very same day and having it suspended.

**eBay Rep**: Welcome to eBay Live Help. This is **eBay Rep**. How may I help you today?


**eBay Rep**: Hi.


**eBay Rep**: May I know your concern please?


ignexo-online: I just finished a chat with another represnetative. I made an ebay account to sell sme spare stationery and on that very same day I was suspended. The last person said my ""selling practices were not good"" despite the fact I haven't sold any items?

**eBay Rep**: Hi.


ignexo-online: hey


**eBay Rep**: I'm sorry to hear that your account was suspended and I understand that you would like to appeal this decision.


ignexo-online: I'm shocked my selling practices are bad, especially when I've sold nothing


**eBay Rep**: Alright. Can you please give me at least 2 minutes to investigate this for you?


ignexo-online: thanks **eBay Rep**, that's good


**eBay Rep**: I'll need a few moments longer, thanks for your patience.


ignexo-online: alright, thanks


**eBay Rep**: Thank you for patiently waiting. Looking at your account, I can see that there are some serious policy breaches, so I'm afraid we won't be reinstating your account.

ignexo-online: which breaches? I SOLD NOTHING


ignexo-online: check my buy/sell history, I was suspended on the day I made the account


**eBay Rep**: I'm sorry to hear that. However, please understand that we want to keep eBay a safe and enjoyable place to buy and sell. We may suspend an account if we have cause for concern. Though I acknowledge your eagerness to help resolve this, it's with much regret to inform you that the suspension placed in your account doesn't have an appeals process to help resolve this.


**eBay Rep**: We've taken this precaution to protect our members and the eBay community. Due to the suspension, you won't be able to use your eBay account in any way. This includes using another existing account or registering a new account.


ignexo-online: Thanks **eBay Rep**, but how on earth could I have breached any rule?


ignexo-online: This is my point, I've never sold anything so how can i breach seller practices


**eBay Rep**: I'm afraid that we are unable to disclose further information on why your account was suspended indefinitely.


ignexo-online: What? So you suspend for no reason and don't tell me why? how would I - or anyone - be able to sell properly if they weren't aware of what rules they've broken


**eBay Rep**: I fully understand that you'd like more precise information on why we have suspended your eBay account. In order to safeguard our community, I'm afraid we’re not allowed to divulge specific information about what led us to take action. By revealing this, we could help members’ intent on breaching the policy to avoid detection.


ignexo-online: I don't know how anyone could ""avoid detection"" when apparently selling nothing is a violation of policy.",23,4,2014-07-31,EBAY,0.09214719384908676,0.8778471946716309,0.030005596578121185

Ebay,Did i make a mistake?,"I listed a couple video games, eBay asked me to do the automatic payments thing and i agreed to it. but i was worried my items would sell before we get our check (Thus overdrafting the account) so i took both down. eBay/Paypal won't charge me will they?",9,2,2014-07-31,EBAY,0.0753047987818718,0.8809595704078674,0.04373560845851898
Ebay,I currently have 30 positive feedback. Should I be concerned about my first and most recent neutral seller feedback?,"I had an international buyer purchase a handheld sega system who left neutral feedback. He claims the sound does not work and the packaging was poor. I stated that the system turns on and buttons work, but never mentioned the sound as I did not realize it was not working. I packed it rather well. I wrapped it in bubble wrap, placed it inside a waterproof mailer and then stuffed in newspaper and enclosed it in a box. I can only assume that the seller was unhappy with the sound issue, which I did not catch and was looking for further complaints or that the international shipping program did not handle the package with care. I could attempt to offer a refund, but I have heard that ebay does not usually make feedback removal easy. I have some significantly more pricy items to liquidate soon. Should I write this off, or attempt to rectify?",5,2,2014-07-31,EBAY,0.04793673753738403,0.9129237532615662,0.03913953900337219
Ebay,Ethical Question: Better item shipped to me by mistake,"I recently purchased a sports card from a dealer that had a really low serial number (/5). Before he shipped my card, he listed the same card only it was the 1/1 parallel of it. I asked if I could pay a bit extra to him to see if he would swap the cards out before shipping. He gets back to me and says that the card had already sold.

A few days after this, I received an email today from the seller saying he accidentally shipped the 1/1 card to me instead of the /5 by mistake, offering to pay shipping costs back to him to return the card along with a few lesser basic cards I had previously asked for but turned down because he was asking way too much.

My question to you is, do I have reason to send the 1/1 card back? Could I offer him some funds via Paypal once the card arrives at me to offset the difference in value? I could be looking at a $500 difference in value between the /5 and the 1/1 if I were to resell it. Thoughts?",7,2,2014-07-31,EBAY,0.0364396832883358,0.9052193760871887,0.05834094062447548
