I've been on ebay selling for quite a number of years. I sell higher priced items... computers, ipads, iphones, etc.

Lately I've come across many buyers... frequently buyers with little or no feedback and weird scrambled letter names or hyphenated names who buy an item in the $100-400 price range and then within a few hours message me that they've bought the item by mistake, their phone was slow and just ""bought it"" in error, etc. and they are asking for a refund.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return item even though I offered him solution. Is this buyer's remorse?,"Hello, So I sold and electronic from my personal collection. I know it works because I had it hooked up and used it myself for a while. I sold it offering no returns.  

Buyer received item and says it works great but when he tries to do something specifically it doesn't seem to work. I recognize this can be fixed by changing a setting in the menu that needs to be changed. I know this because I had to do the exact same thing. I explained to him exactly how to fix it and that it's not broken and even sent him a link to an article talking about how to do that very thing. 

He responded basically saying that he doesn't want to try it because he's already spent an hour trying to get it to work. I asked him if he'd tried changing the setting and he said no, but that he'd just like a full refund and that he wants me to pay for return shipping.

Do you think this is worth fighting? The item was very expensive and heavy and I really rather not take a loss on shipping it again over something with an easy solution.

Ebay,Need help with sale of valuable comic,"I recently auctioned a very valuable comic on eBay - it sold for slightly more than $10k. 

When I entered the shipping info I accidentally entered USPS instead of UPS.

By the time I woke up and saw the messages the buyer had already opened a dispute and requested a refund with eBay. EBay also suspended my account at the same time - I can't figure out why.

Right now I have no way to get in touch with buyer to let him know about the mistake in shipping info and no way to get in touch with eBay about this or my suspended account. I'm stuck in eBay hell where nothing on the site works and there is no way to contact anyone. 

Item is very valuable and will arrive Tuesday by 1030 AM.

The shipping label he provided me used his address as both the To and From address. This concerns me because if the package doesn't get delivered, or the seller decides to have it returned to sender (his address), it will show up as not delivered and I won't have the product. 

I messaged the seller asking him to fix the issue. He emailed me a new label, but now the return address is different. Additionally, he refuses to update the shipping label on ebay, or even attach it to a message on ebay. 

What do I do at this point? I don't want to be a difficult buyer, but I feel like there are so many red flags here that I need to be careful. Thank you. 

Edit: I contacted ebay, but all they did was send canned message (to me oddly) that explained how to do a return.",5,3,2017-09-05,EBAY,0.05140748992562294,0.9088901281356812,0.03970234841108322

Ebay,Received fake watch but eBay won't issue me a refund.,"I opened up a return request on 23/08. On 24/08 I shipped out the Item via Canada Post and they told me it would arrive in 6-10 days.


The big realization: the seller convinced me to send it back to him via the cheapest method available and me, unfamiliar with the eBay return process, obliged and spent a measly CAD$40 on shipping it to him WITHOUT a tracking number because tracking would've effectively doubled the cost. Naive me thought it wasn't worth the extra money because I was paying out of my own pocket and God knows how long til eBay refunds me the money.
I called eBay and went up to their escalation department. They basically told me I am shit out of luck if the seller decides to straight up lie and say that the item did NOT arrive. They sent an e-mail to the seller because the item should've arrived by now but other than that, they told me they could not help me any further.


How screwed am I?


Is there something I can do with my credit card company?
I know it was extremely naive and stupid of me to send it without tracking but that was literally my first time EVER returning a product I bought online. I wouldn't be TOO salty losing CAD$298.19 because that's probably worth like two US dollars but I feel extremely cheated and an extra 300 bucks would go a long way towards my next big watch purchase.

The only item I've sold where a high amount of watchers made sense to me was a $12,000 limited edition Liberty Taylor acoustic guitar.

Just the other day I countered an offer, the buyer ignored the offer and bought the item elsewhere for cheaper. I would have gone lower and the buyer would have gotten the best deal had they sent another offer. 

Are buyers afraid to haggle? Or do some just not understand  the way it works? It may not be the best but I like to think of Best Offer as negotiating the price of a car: start high and meet in the middle.",26,9,2017-09-09,EBAY,0.05220995843410492,0.8840045928955078,0.0637853816151619
Ebay,Buyers won't pay,"I've been selling a lot of stuff lately, my parents are moving and dropped a truckload of stuff at my apartment, I donated the junk and put the valuables in eBay. I have this stupid problem where no one pays. First it was this 2 Metallica shirts from an early tour, I listed this item 3 times before the buyer finally paid the $350 he bid it up to, and I had to harass him for a week to pay. Now I've moved onto selling video games, these people bid on items and than don't pay or reply to messages. One guy bid a game up to $172 and hasn't paid or replied in 4 days, I currently have 5 open cases of unpaid items.

Yes there is a delay in the mail due to weather. However thats not in my control, and you certainly dont deserve both your money back and my item.

We're both from USA btw.

Obviously I don't trust him to give me the money back AFTER I ship it out.
So what now? What can Ebay even do? Seems like he can just lie and never pay me back the money it cost me to return it.

He's refusing to give me the money first to ship it back.
Says he will only ""refund upon receipt""

EDIT again

I called Ebay and they don't know why he can't send me a return shipping label since we're both in the USA (probably just lying like i said). They said to ask the seller to buy a label for me on USPS.com and then attach the image of the label to the Ebay case &amp; then I can print it from there. And if the seller does not do that, then I have to wait until this friday until Ebay can step in and give me a return label at no cost to me.

Ebay,I actually beat a fraudulent INAD return claim.,"I sold a used electronic item (radio) for a relatively low amount ($30 shipped). It was listed as ""used"", with no returns, and had photos of the radio display playing/operating on my test bench.

Buyer receives the item and opens a return request stating that the radio did not play audio. I told them that it must be some issue with the way they were hooking it up, or it could be that they had to call and activate the subscription service before it would play channels. The buyer still repeated their claim.

I eventually tired of dealing with them and told them they could return it and if it was in the original condition in the original packaging I would refund them. I told them they could simply put it back in the original package with the original label and mark ""refused"" on the label and it would be returned to me.

The next day, the buyer escalated their return request to a claim, asking ebay to mediate. Ebay of course auto-accepted the return and provided the buyer a shipping label, that I would later have to pay for. Today the radio came back, and I took it out and back to my test bench. I got out my phone and made a video. I recorded an existing radio of mine playing on the test bench. Then I took the returned radio, flipped it over to show the serial number, and put it on my bench. It immediately powered up and played audio normally.

I uploaded the video to youtube and send the buyer a link to it via messaging, not expecting a reply. The return case still showed ""awaiting delivery"" as I guess the tracking hadn't updated quite yet.

For kicks, I called ebay to see if they would consider this evidence. I told the rep, who seemed to be a normal american guy, and asked him to look at the case and see if he could close it in my favor since I had done nothing wrong. He put me on hold for about 3 minutes (it was a 90 second video that I made/linked to) came back, and explained that they could only do so much even with the proof, because it wasn't as though we could force them  to ship the item back etc. I was ready to be told it was just too bad, but then he told me that he was just going to give me a courtesy refund and let me keep my item. 

I was also kinda expecting that the claim might go through the automated system normally in spite of what he told me, but about 15 minutes this showed up in my email:

""Here's an update for your recent return.

Hi -----,

Ebay,"Seller withheld information, not discovered until after return period","Hi! A few months ago I purchased a used DSLR lens on eBay. I only just discovered (after the Money Back Guarantee period expired) from contacting the manufacturer that it's a gray market copy. For anyone not familiar with gray market photography equipment, it's imported without the manufacturer's consent and often of unknown background, not covered by a warranty, (for this lens maker) not serviced by the manufacturer at any price, and valued lower than domestically-sold copies. Gray market equipment is often advertised as ""imported"", ""from &lt;other country&gt;"", ""seller's warranty"", or ""no warranty"", or it's sold as new but at obviously too good a price to be true. That wasn't disclosed in the seller's description and there was nothing to raise a flag, so I contacted the seller last week with my concern. His somewhat understandable response was that because he had not said the lens was a US copy, he had accurately and honestly described the item and could not accept a return, which is technically true but seems like a pretty shady attitude.

In hindsight, it's painfully clear that I should have checked the serial number immediately after receiving the lens, and it's the only thing I didn't think to double- and triple-check.

My main question is: is this something that would be considered fraud by eBay? Or are there any other options? I'm reluctant to simply sell the lens because, feeling a little more scrupulous than the seller, I'd likely take a loss with an honest description (especially since in using it I've found some minor optical flaws he either didn't notice or didn't feel compelled to disclose). I don't want to make a fraud complaint and then find out that this is just how eBay works, though.

Ebay,Sold a jacket on eBay for £50 and the buyer has asked me to pay for a special product as she said it smells of smoke. How should I handle this?,Should I do this? Its a north face jacket so apparently she needs to buy a special product called Nikwax Tech Wash for approx £5 to clean it. It's a waterproof jacket and sold as used condition but has only been worn a couple times. She said it smells strongly of smoke but I'm quite confused as it hasn't been around smoke/smokers. How should I handle this? . She messaged me a few days ago asking if it had been washed and I didn't get round to responding but she bought it the next day anyway (I didn't message back to say it hadn't been cleaned as I didn't realise it was the same person who bought it as who messaged) I don't really want to have to go down the route of returning and refunding the full amount or having a case opened on me.,15,5,2017-09-13,EBAY,0.03544643521308899,0.9252114295959473,0.03934209421277046
Ebay,Potential Scams,"Today I sold an LG G6 on eBay and an iPhone 7 plus 128GB and normally my transactions are flawless.  

Buyer typically pays...eBay sends me email to ""ship now"" and I do. 

The winner of the LG G6 won but has not paid (and I have a feeling won't) 

The Winner of the iPhone 7 well I got an email from PayPal that said ""Notification of Pending PayPal Payment""

...but a hunch tells me this is a strategy a potential scammer will use so that I ship the item and then once they get it just cancel the payment (or even cancel it once I tell them I ship it)

Also, both of these bidders messaged me an eerily similar message that said the phones were gifts please ship immediately.   I think both are going the same direction.

What are my options? (Since I know they want to scam me)

Ebay,"Seller authorized a 3rd party to sign for a very expensive item. Over 5 days after the package was confirmed delivered, buyer claims item is damaged. Where do I stand?","The title basically says it all. Last week I sold an expensive and delicate item (a $1,000+ MSRP piece of audio gear) to an unknown but well reviewed buyer. He has many transactions and overwhelmingly positive feedback.

Well, the buyer claims he was out of town when the package arrived, so he had one of his coworkers sign for the package last Thursday. He told me this after I shipped it, so he did not get my permission to do this before I sent it. I had the package insured and tracked, so I know for a fact it arrived early Thursday (less than 48 hours after I shipped it).

So today, over 5 full days after it arrived, the buyer contacted me to say the contents of the package were damaged. He did not offer pictures or anything else in the way of explanation. He just said things jarred loose during shipping.

He says he's going to take the item to his local audio gear specialist this weekend and he'll let me know if it's seriously damaged. I think he's expecting me to eat the cost of this item if it's permanently damaged, but I feel like I can't take responsibility for an item that's been in some third party's (his coworker) possession for nearly a week. If there is any damage, who's to say it didn't happen when his coworker was in possession?

So, where do I stand in the opinion of this community? Should I start to file a claim with the shipper (it was Fedex)? I'm worried that by initiating any claim process I'm accepting responsibility for the situation. Also, I think that the claim process will be a waste of time because the packaging was not damaged, and I doubt the buyer kept the shipping package. To my knowledge he has no photos or any credible evidence to show the damage occurred during shipping.

To be clear, I feel like this is 100% his fault. The way I see it, once he decided to have someone else sign for it, and wait a week to get in touch with me, this item became his responsibility. This wasn't a problem that was addressed same day. It took nearly a week for him to get in touch. Furthermore, he's taking the item to yet another party to have it inspected. Again, he's doing this without my permission. He just sent a message telling me he was doing this.

So, what should I do? What's the smartest way to handle this?",10,3,2017-09-13,EBAY,0.08101384341716766,0.8895341753959656,0.029451992362737656

Ebay,venting about buyers,"Ebay has taught me to carefully consider any purchases. I mostly use the site to sell like new items that I buy and figure out that I don't need rather than abusing amazons return policy etc. 

I don't have much else to sell and I'm glad. I can't believe how annoying and stressful some buyers are. 

Someone recently won one of my auctions and he requested a few more pics of the item before payment. Which I was completely ok with but he started with ""before I decide to buy"" and Immediately knew that he won't likely pay. The item is in pristine condition. Then the next day he responds asking me ""does it come with the case?"" Which I specifically show in the photo and mention several times that its included.I haven't heard anything else back.

I went into my site preferences and set the strictest requirements for buyers along with the shortest unpaid item assistant. I will probably do buy it now if possible from now on. I've found good advice to simply ignore stupid questions as these buyers are problematic if they do win. 

Another pet peeve is people asking for serial numbers to electronic items. While I'm not offended if they really do want to check if its stolen etc I would think that people could do some bad stuff with those numbers. I usually respond if they have good feedback that I will send a photo of it before they send payment.

Ebay,How long after calling before requested limits actually raise?,"Hello

So I recently got my hands on a large amount of product and filled my listing limit up in just a few hours. I called ebay and the guy who helped (very rude) said they'd double my limits. I didn't get an email or anything, and just assumed it took a day or two to process.

A couple weeks passed and still nothing had happened, so I called again and the woman on the phone (very nice) told me that there was no record of me trying to raise it but said she'd double it today. This time I got a confirmation email saying my limit has changed, but it's been several hours and I still cannot post anything and my limit on the seller dashboard still says it hasn't been raised. 

Does anyone have any experience with how long it takes before you actually can start posting more items?

Edit:
Ok so update. I decided to call again. Another guy answered. He said that both times I had called in the past an unknown error had come up and he doesn't know why. He tried again on the phone with me and it still didn't work. He said to give him 15 minutes on hold and talked to someone about fixing it. He came back and said it went through no problem, and that it's showing up correct on his end now and that it should show up in the next 5 to 10 minutes. For some reason I believed him.

30 minutes passed and I got an email again saying my limit has been raised, but it's still showing up as not raising...

Edit 2:

YES! I got it raised. Had to call again and ask to stay on the line until it went though. It didn't go through the first time again and my rep was able to try something else and it worked the second time!

Ebay,First time shipper questions,"Okay so I am selling some books and textbooks to make some extra money and I've been reading many things online about how to ship specifically books properly and I still have questions (please explain like I'm five...)

1. I've set my items so the buyer pays shipping, how do I use that amount towards the actual shipping cost once somebody has bought one of my books? 

2. How do I use an eBay shipping label properly, as in, is it postage (it includes what the buyer paid for the shipping? If this is true, what happens if the shipping cost is less than the amount the buyer paid? Where would that extra money go)? Or is it just a literal label that just shows the addresses on it?

3. I want to use Media Mail because it's the cheapest for shipping but one of the first things I'm doing is selling a Very Good condition textbook and I know if I put it in an envelope it'll probably get banged around so I want to maybe put it in a box. I've seen some people using corrugated cardboard and making their own packaging. Where are they getting that cardboard and how much does it cost?

Ebay,"Shipped with UPS for first time on ebay, how is shipping paid?","I just shipped with UPS with ebay for the first time today because I sold an item weighing 47 pounds and UPS had a better rate than USPS. I got the label off the UPS sight for the item no problem. Question is, how do I pay for the shipping? It was stating shipping was like $37 but I wasn't asked for credit card information or payment information at all. So how does UPS collect payment from me?",11,2,2017-09-16,EBAY,0.03450680524110794,0.9345354437828064,0.03095778077840805
Ebay,Confused about ups shipping,"Usually when I ship something UPS on my main account I just lcick print label next to the sold item and the typical print label page shows up that is used for usps/fedex/ups. I type in dimensions, weight, and declared value and it generate a label  Ican print immediately. I had set up UPS a very long time ago so don't remember the process.

I am selling an item for a family member using their account and when I click print label it tells me to sign up for UPS which I do. Then It tells me to enroll in the ebay marketplace and link the account which I do. Then I choose step 3 to print the label and it send me off to the UPS website and I have to deal with a million steps and re-entering the ship from address.

There's also a warning message saying I need to get someone to sign the receipt for claim purposes, and it cannot be signed by someone at the UPS STORE, which makes absolutely no sense to me. Only a UPS driver or customer care representative, whatever that is. When I declare a value on my main ebay account, I never needed to print out any receipts or make someone sign them.

Usually it just automatically deducts from my preferred paypal payment method but now I have a billing account on UPS or something which is currently at 0 and I am assuming I have to actually ship it for the balance to show up.

How do I make it go back to the old style so I don't have to deal with all this nonsense? Or was this always the proper way of doing it and I have some weird grandfathered thing on my main account?

Oh and the main question is can I get the UPS store people to sign anyway and that will be enough for claim purposes? They have to be kidding otherwise.",1,2,2017-09-16,EBAY,0.04094870015978813,0.9309003949165344,0.028150876984000206

Ebay,$17.50 to ship a guitar hero controller??,"So I figured I'd take a stab at selling guitar hero guitars. This one was actually a Rock Band 4 guitar.

Ebay,Have a buyer that said item I sent has stopped working. Need advice on what to do.,"Hey everyone, last week I sold an old racing wheel of mine for the PS3/PS4/PC. Item was working flawlessly(used it the day before I sold it). Packed it up and shipped it out, package got delivered. Received a message from the buyer this morning stating that the wheel was working as expected when they received it, but that it had since stopped working. They are stating that the power cuts in and out and that the FFB (force feedback) is not working for the game they are trying to play. After telling me the game they were trying to play, I found the games website and I explained that the wheel  for the game that they said that they were trying to use it on was not supported by the developer, but just got another message that the power cuts off and on. My feeling is that I delivered a working item (as the buyer said so themselves) and that my responsibility as a seller is completed. I find that a technical fault is pretty super unlikely for a 2 year old product that I sparsely used and that their use of the item has probably damaged it. The buyer has not asked for a refund and I have been trying to help troubleshoot the best I can. After trying to help as much as I can, it seems the buyer seems to get more frustrated (I understand their side as well) and I assume they will probably escalate this sooner or later.

He said that they were hard to fold, saying that that was something I should've mentioned in my listing, and that they broke.

At this point I think I'm a goner. The headphones had no issue of folding whatsoever before I shipped them, and I had been folding them for ages with no problems. Also, they must have not broken during shipping, as this return claim is more than two weeks after it was delivered. He sent a picture of the headphones, now broken. I've read enough posts online about how sellers are up shit creek when this happens, so I was bracing myself for the fact that I'd be not only be out the headphones, but my $80 as well.

So I call up eBay customer service, and I did not expect them to be super helpful, but boy was I wrong. They immediately said that the buyer's case was invalid, and I was clearly in the right. They'd close the case immediately and release my funds.

Ebay,I recently sold a waterproof north face jacket. The buyer claimed it smelled of smoke so I refunded her £2.50 to buy a cleaning product. Now a few days later she wants me to buy her a reproofing product?,"Hi all, I sold the jacket for £50. I sold it as very good condition (because I have only worn it a couple of times as it was too big so has just been stored in a wardrobe since). The buyer claimed that it smelled strongly of smoke. However I'm not sure how as it hasn't been around any smoke. I explained to her that I'm not sure how and it may have been the plastic packaging used to send it. So anyway I refunded her £2.50 to buy the cleaning product she needed. Today, a few days later, She has sent me this message:

""Thanks for the refund, got it today, unfortunately now I have worn the jacket in heavy rain and the fabric is starting to absorb water so I need to treat it with another product. I found the cheapest for £3.50. 

I feel like the jacket may not have just been worn a few times as stated in the listing (I found a hair grip in the pocket that had been there so long there is a small rust stain) and the outside popper and zip have started to turn green, so they have oxidised over a long period of time.

I am happy to leave positive feedback however if you are willing to refund a final 3.50 and hopefully I can restore the jacket to a like-new condition""

How should I handle this? I can't afford to keep on buying her products. I don't understand how it needs reproofing either, I wore it out like twice in the rain from it being new and have never washed it. If I refuse can she try to return it even after she has washed it AND worn it out in the rain? Also I'm not sure if it helps at all but 1) I sold it as ""very good condition"" and not ""like new"" or ""new"" so it's bound to not be up to brand new standards right? &amp; 2) I have sold about 21 items recently and for any feedback I have been left it has been all positive so I have %100 positive feedback?

Ebay,Buyer claiming not to have received item but tracking shows delivered,"I've received a message today from a buyer claiming that an item I sent a couple of weeks ago has not been received and requesting refund asap as they've had to buy it elsewhere.

 The postage tracking shows that it was delivered and signed for over a week ago. I'm having trouble accessing the signature online at the moment to see what it says.

The company I used for postage (Hermes) does have a reputation for couriers not doing their job properly so I am open to the idea that they've not received it, however I do have some concerns, the main one being why has it taken so long for the buyer to contact me?

Claiming with the delivery company could be difficult since the item is showing as delivered so I don't want to just refund.

My plan at the moment is to ask the buyer to check with their neighbours and in any safe places to see whether the item has been left there and if not to open an INR case. 

Is there anything specific I should be asking or saying to the buyer?  Assuming it gets to the INR stage, my understanding is that I've followed the requirements so eBay would find in my favour? How relevant is the signature (item worth about £100)? Would eBay remove any negative feedback in this case?

Ebay,Repair service offered on ebay gone sour.,"I bought a repair service for a power board that the seller claims was damaged during shipping only after I discovered the board wasn't working properly days later when I received it back.  He agrees to a refund but only after I ship my board back again to him to ""undo"" the repairs he made and he'll send back to me.  

This sounds impractical but not unreasonable.  Should I be required to send my original board back to him?  He offered to pay for that shipping cost but not sure how to get reimbursement up front for this cost that wasn't included in the final bid price.  

EDIT:  I'm almost certain but I can't prove he probably damaged the board on accident while trying to repair it.  There is a crack on the circuit board located in a certain pattern that if you pull it off the backplate with enough force, could have caused the crack.  I only speculate this because there are plastic ""secure tabs"" located exactly where the crack was made.  He said it got damaged because I wrote ""this side up"" on the box which I did not write at all.  I think this dishonesty is why I'm reluctant to send him back my board, and he has no incentive to send it back to me if I expect a full refund anyways.",5,3,2017-09-18,EBAY,0.16022096574306488,0.8027191758155823,0.03705991432070732

Now that seems harmless, no? Well, he sent me the same message, once again in Spanish and then his attempt at an English translation. I decided to dig into him a little bit, and this is where the red flags started to pop up. He only has two feedbacks, which were positive, which were both on September 15th. One says ""Excellent buyer, a++++++"" and the other says ""Great communication, a pleasure to do business with!"".

Ebay,How does this scam work?,"I've been an eBayer for a very long time and I buy a lot off eBay and I've sold things as well. I've never been scammed as a seller but I have as a buyer. Normally, I just call eBay instead of dealing with the automated system and their very helpful. 

Lately, when I buy I've noticed the seller never actually sends the item I was buying. This has happened three times in the past four months. They never ship, despite have 100% feedback. No problem, I open a case and I get my money back. Once I bought an item where they had more than one. I bought cause they had 100% feedback, however, a day or two after I bought it I saw that someone else had left negative feedback for not receiving the same item I had bought.

Ebay,So how out of luck am I here? eBay siding with buyer story.,"I'm pretty new to selling on ebay. 

Last month I sold an item. 

Buyer paid. 

I shipped it. 

A week or two goes buy and buyer submits an appeal because it hasn't arrived yet. 

I look at the tracking info and it says it's still in transit (to Hawaii if that makes a difference). 

I provide the tracking info in the appeal that shows it's still in transit. 

Apparently at the time of the appeal, the tracking info hadn't shown an update in like 7 days. 

eBay sides with buyer. 

I refund buyer. 

Fast foward another week about and I just got confirmation via the tracking number that the item has been delivered finally. 

I call eBay and ask if they can do anything and they're like lol no go contact the buyer and see if they'll pay you. 

I can't imagine the buyer paying me instead of just keeping the item for free. 

Even though I have proof that the item was delivered they refused to do anything and told me that future appeals on the same issue wouldn't go anywhere. 

Is there anything I can do? 

I did issue the buyer a new invoice and messaged him letting him know that I see it finally got delivered and he could pay me or kindly return the item though I don't have hope on that end. 

Should I call back again? 

I'm just baffled that I have PROOF that the item was delivered and that doesn't make a difference. 

Did I miss some fine print that says I agree that the mail carriers won't screw up? 

Ugh. I'm sure you're all used to this sort of thing by now. But like I said I'm new to this so this is really bothering me.

EDIT: 

I reached out to @AskeBay on Twitter. After DMing them the details of the situation they got back to me with this:

Ebay,PayPal Payment Cancellation After Shipment,"Long story short here... I sold a smartphone for $405.00 on eBay, received payment through PayPal, shipped the item. Item was held up due to Hurricane Irma (buyer is from Miami). Finally made its way to Miami and I get an email notification from PayPal that the payment has been cancelled. Called USPS to intercept the package, but it was already on the truck today and was delivered. Timeline below:

Auction end - 9/6

Payment received - 9/7

Package shipped - 9/9

Payment cancelled - 9/17

Package delivered - 9/18

I contacted PayPal prior to the delivery this morning and was told they would do nothing and I shouldn't ship without payment (which I already had). Connected USPS who attempted to help, but it was too late. I plan on calling eBay first thing tomorrow as I was hoping USPS would intercept and save me more hassle.

Ebay,Buyer wants a refund on phone when I listed it as for parts not working?,"So my phone was messing up and I was really descriptive when selling the phone. I list all the issues. I have perfect track record on my account. Basically the phone was in a boot loop. He messaged me 2 weeks later after receiving the phone that it doesn't turn on, that is a lie because the phone definitely turns on before I sold it. 

I think that the buyer purchased the item  thinking that he could get it to work and it doesn't. He probably spent 2 weeks tinkering with the phone trying to get it to work back like normal and now he says the phone is dead. I listed it as for parts not working and as descriptive as I could be. So if I received my phone now it is probably worse then when I sold it. It turned on and was in a bootloop. What to do? Should I refund him the phone? I don't want to because it is probably worse then when I sold it. He says the phone doesn't turn on. If that was the case why didn't he tell me couple days after he got it, but 2 whole weeks afteR?

They recently had a couple of items listed at  $80. I sent offers for both at 25% off ($60) each.

It's just so infuriating! She got what she wanted, I'm giving her a full refund.

She claims I didn't have the poor condition of my item anywhere but it's very clear in the photo's I took, which she now said that she sees the condition issues but I should have had it in the description. Maybe I should have. I believed the photos showed the condition clearly.

So she's getting refunded £1. One measly pound! Negative feedback over one measly pound!

Ebay,"Buyer returned item, in pieces. what can I do?","So I recently sold a bike, the guy that bought it wasnt happy with some scrapes, which i thought met the description, he said it didnt, whatever, i paid return shipping, figured that trying to fight it would be a waste of time and energy since Ebay isnt very seller friendly.

So i was out of town when the bike arrived, I had a friend check that the bike was in the box, which it was, so i issued the refund (yep mistake) now I just got home, and he completely disassembled the bike, I mean bearings, bushings, little screws, brake calipers and derailleur in pieces, etc.. 
 I shipped the bike with the wheels off, you know, the normal way you ship a bike. and he returned it as disassembled as possible, used the same box, so theres no excuse why he would need to do that. 

I called ebay saying that i need to pay a bike shop to assemble the bike because its taken apart to an extent that it takes lots of specialty tools that i dont have. they basically said suck it up.

I just started the case, so I figure it'll work out for me in the end, but the seller keeps responding back ""Sorry you didn't like it"" and insisting on a partial refund in order to not have to pay shipping costs back (to China.)

Like, I'll throw the band away if you don't want to pay shipping costs back, but it's not my fault that you're selling things with 100% incorrect descriptions!

What a waste of time.

On a practical note, if they keep on insisting on a partial refund, how do I escalate the issue with Ebay?

Ebay,Buyer still messaging me after INR case was closed in my favor,"I shipped the item with tracking and got it back a couple of weeks later (""Return to sender - No name"" was written on the package). So being the honest seller that I am, I sent him a message offering to reship the item at his cost or receive a refund for the selling price minus the cost of shipping. He said he wanted a full refund and ""let ebay handle this. It will be fair for both of us"" and opened an INR case. eBay reviewed the case and closed it in my favor (I knew they would). He left negative feedback, which I had eBay remove. A couple of days later, he sent me a message saying that the amount minus shipping was fine, which I ignored (I'm not going to send him a refund after he declined it earlier and then file a case and lost and left me negative feedback). A couple of hours later, he sent another message demanding a refund, stating that I promised to send a refund and that he would contact the police. I ignored that message too but did report him to eBay. The next day I get a message saying he will file a case in court. Ignored. I've gotten two more messages demanding a refund. I've already blocked him but he's able to message me because he purchased the item. Is there anything else I can do? Is it worth calling eBay? I'm not concerned about police or court threats. It's just annoying now.

UPDATE: If you haven't gone through the comments, the buyer opened a case with PayPal and the case was immediately closed in their favor. Funds were taken from my balance and refunded to him. I called PayPal asking for an explanation and the rep was unable to tell me why it was closed in their favor and said she thought it was a glitch and that I would be receiving a credit in the next couple of days. I'll pick it up from there... I called PayPal again a couple of hours ago because I wasn't completely satisfied with their ""glitch"" explanation. I kind of had a feeling that nothing was going to be done even though they said to give them 24-72 hours. I told the rep I called earlier and was calling again just to get some clarification on why the case was closed so quickly (I noted that the email I received notifying me that a case had been opened said I had until October 11 to respond but the case was closed immediately). She took at look at the case again and said she honestly didn't know why it was closed. She didn't mention anything about a glitch or that they were investigating the earlier call, but said that since I have been a member since 2002, she would open a ticket and credit my account the amount that was refunded. When I log into my account, it now shows that the case is being reviewed again and that it's in the appeal step. Before I called the second time, the case was still closed so I have a feel nothing would have happened if I hadn't called again. Oh, I did ask how I should proceed if this situation were to ever occur again and couldn't get a straight answer. She kept apologizing for the inconvenience and assured me that I would receive a refund (she avoided the question). I also asked if someone is allowed to open a PayPal case after losing an eBay case and she said yes because they have different policies. Also, thanks to everyone who responded. I appreciate the tips and opinions. Looking back, even though he responded with rudeness after I tried to be a good seller, I should have just sent him a full refund. I was beyond annoyed that after losing the case with eBay, he messaged me and told me that my original refund offer was fine and to refund him as soon as possible, which is why I ignored him, which lead him to send more messages and eventually the PayPal case. The cost of shipping wasn't worth the time it took to call eBay about the case he opened, the time it took to have his negative feedback removed, the time it took to call PayPal, as most importantly, the stress. As I've seen multiples on here, it's the cost of doing business. Hopefully I'll see my funds returned in the next 24 hours. I'll post a final update if that happens. 

FINAL UPDATE: After multiple promises of getting my money back, PayPal denied the refund. I've probably spent over 5 hours on hold/talking to a rep and I'm over this.",49,11,2017-09-21,EBAY,0.09169615060091019,0.8792256712913513,0.029078172519803047

I contacted Ebay and asked for the contact info of Apple or their legal representative and all they gave me is an e-mail address!!

Ebay,What has happened to Ebay?,"I have been a member for almost 20 years. I have bought and sold hundreds of items (feedback 217).

A little bit about me - I'm an international buyer who lives far enough from the US/UK/AUS that direct shipping costs can be prohibitively high. Forwarding companies act as middlemen who receive parcels in these countries and send them internationally to where I am. Their warehouse is the registered/verified address on my Ebay and Paypal. So long as your item has been delivered there and you can provide tracking, this is no different from selling to someone's home address. From here on, you have done your job and any issues that arise are between the freight forwarder and me.

If anything, I understand it becomes easier for sellers to win disputes when these services are involved because they void buyer protection.

Could someone explain the logic of freight forwarding = scam / dishonest buyer / avoid at all costs? :)",28,8,2017-09-22,EBAY,0.051358338445425034,0.9207679033279419,0.027873769402503967

Ebay,eBay actually does protect sellers.,"So i have posted a few times on here about how my first eBay sale has been a disaster but just wanted to explain what happened. I sold a ""New"" Laptop which was bought instantly by a buyer with decent feedback. I received the money on PayPal and packed up the item nicely and shipped it out. As soon as the buyer received the item he immediately opened a ""INAD"" case. Claiming that the item was damaged and scratched and ran poorly. Which i knew was false because the laptop was in perfect condition and worked 100%. I kindly said he could return the item ""i would pay shipping"" and then i would give him a refund. I sent the buyer and return label and sent it to eBay.. calculated costs and made sure it was the correct label for him to sent it back. Ebay told me on the phone that the label was the correct one for the item and to wait until buyer returned..then a day later the buyer sent eBay a message saying that USPS could not ship the item because the label wasn't enough money.. he said he needed a extra $18 for the label. I told him eBay confirmed it was the right label and there's no way it would cost that much since buyer was only a few states away and i already calculated the correct cost. Anyways i was heading out of town and called eBay and they said i was in the right and to just wait until the item got returned. Well..... they sided in the buyers favor a few hours later and then paypal stripped the money out of my bank account. I was furious but was out of town and could not handle it at the moment. When i got back home he still had not returned the item and had not even used the label according to the tracking number. I called up paypal and eBay and begged to speak to a manager.. took about 45 min until i reached a manager.. then showed him the unused return label and he reserved the case in my favor and gave me my money back on paypal. Please if you are getting taken advantage of by a buyer and your in the right. dont stop calling eBay..",6,4,2017-09-22,EBAY,0.04474109783768654,0.9130768775939941,0.04218200221657753

Ebay,"Not completely Ebay related, but extremely similar transaction. Seller pressuring me to release PayPal funds after providing a tracking number and receipt of shipping, suspicious? Should I wait?","I posted this in the PayPal subreddit, but it doesn't seem to be very active, and I thought that my situation would apply here, as it is basically the second half of an Ebay transaction. Feel free to remove if it does not.

Long story short, an item I've been looking for for an extremely long time (extremely rare wall flag from one of my favorite bands) appeared on a Facebook group I'm apart of. I worked it out with the seller and asked if he had an approved Paypal account instead of having to send money through Friends and Family, as I have been ripped off before. He said yes, no problem. I sent him the money and he sent me a picture of the receipt with the tracking number and weight of the item, along with the package itself (last name on the package did not match the last name through PayPal but did his Facebook name, which also raised a red flag) with the matching tracking number sticker attached to it on the same night. The next morning I wake up to him asking me to release the funds because he was getting the message ""This payment will be held in your Pending Balance until October 11, 2017. It may be available sooner once we know the transaction went smoothly."" and wanted me to click ""Recieved item/purchased goods"", BEFORE THE ITEM WAS EVEN IN USPS'S SYSTEM. I asked him if I could at least wait to see if the package was on its way to me, first, now a little suspicious. He seemed distraught, but told me he'd wait until that night for USPS to update.


With weird timing after I told him my request of seeing it on the website first, the website suspiciously updated at 4:13pm (a few hours after I told him I'd like to see it actually sent to me first).
Is it possible for him to recall the package? I am 100% planning on releasing the funds to him as long as I get the item that was described, but I feel him pressuring me to release it early is a little dodgy. I kind of thought he would follow standard PayPal protocol and wait until the item reaches me first before he receives his funds, what I thought was the point of PayPal buyer protection.


What I want to know is, is there a way for him to cancel the package after he has sent it out, or is it 100% safe for me to wait until I actually receive the item to make sure it's not just filled with nothing? I do NOT want to lose this item because I was being extra cautious as I've said, It's and Item I've been looking for for YEARS. But if he's being honest about the whole thing and needs his funds ASAP, I feel sort of guilty for asking him to wait (and am scared that he will cancel the sale all together since I won't release the funds).


Any advice on what I should do? If you took the time to read all of this, I want to thank you. I hope you have an amazing day/night, wherever you are &lt;3",17,4,2017-09-23,EBAY,0.04048660770058632,0.9285321235656738,0.03098124824464321

Ebay,Cheaper Pricing &amp; Ranking Higher Than Competitors,"I own an eCommerce clothing store and I have recently set up an eBay shop. I've actually got a decent amount of sales through eBay in the last month which surprised me, as the clothing I sell is lesser known brands.

All of these competitors sell the items at the same price (i.e 29.99). My question is - If I was to list my items 0.04 lower than all my competitors (i.e 29.95), would this give me an advantage and help my listings be shown more frequently / higher up than my competitors?

I let him know I was going on a trip and would not be able to ship for a while if I didn't ship this week.

Ebay,Buyer claims I sent him box of trash.,"I am a first time seller and I sold a $2000 item on Ebay. I put the item up for auction and a bidder from the UK won it.

He is requesting a full refund and has asked ebay to step in. I have called ebay several time and explained the situation and they seemed to be very helpful. I have also contacted USPS and filed a claim with them. At this point ebay is reviewing the case and preparing a decision.

Ebay,"Purchased a Light Coffee rug, instead I get pink and a partial refund!?","okay so as the title suggests, I bought a rug about last week. in my mind and the pictures, it would come out as a light coffee color, almost bear fur for £10, which was a steal.

Day it arrives, I open it up to find that it's not the one I ordered, but instead is some shoddy made pink furry one with gold trim.....what the hell? I hit the seller up and it turns out he's based in Hong Kong, whereas the item originates from London? ooookkayyy. I tell him my problem and waiting daily for a single message, with quotes from him;

- ""Would you like 2 pounds refund to keep item?""
- ""Due to light,it may has some color difference""
- ""Could you pls tell us how much refund do you accept if you keep item?""
- ""Maybe you could give your friends or sell it"" - This was repeated three times throughout our messages.

Eventually the message gets through his head and he refunds me HALF of the original price, just so i can keep the item when I don't even want it, though i get the suspicion he doesn't want it back.

I understand I'm eligible for ebay's moneyback guarantee, but given the situation and a partial refund, am i still under protection with this?

Ebay,Very suspicious of buyer. Seeking advice.,"Hey friends,

I listed a laptop for $850 with $1105 buy it now, and it only took 4 minutes. This was my first alarm bell, as it is a used item - 1105 is near retail. There are also other of the same item with buy it now listed a couple hundred dollars under mine. 

The buyer has only 4 positive feedback, and in the ""bids"" list, their ""location"" zip code is different than their shipping address. Alarm two. 

Alarm three - the address is a ""low income"" apartment block in Los Angeles. Maybe that's a little much to look into, however this is an expensive luxury item to smash ""buy it now"" on, to be living in a low income apartment block. Viewing the user, the username is a person's name, but the name that displays is NOT the name on the account.

They paid through PayPal and the status remained as ""pending"" for a few days. The buyer starts messaging me through eBay and gets pushy about me shipping it. I decided to not ship within 1 business day which is what I promised. I contacted PayPal and they said do not ship the item if it says pending in my PayPal account.

Me: I’m sorry to hear that, it was working fine before I sold it.

Him: my wife showed it to our neighbor and he told that that phone has main board damage ( maybe crack) and it need to be replaced with working one!

Me: To my knowledge, the phone was in working condition. However, if you want, you can ship it back to me and I will refund you your money. Sorry for the inconveniences.

Him: but the fact is that it is bot working , a guy checked it and told me that the main board has a crack and it need to be replaced with working one, he also suggested me to do it for USD40, if you don’t mind you can pay it and I will keep this phone or I will return it and you will need to find someone who can replace the main board

Me: Could you please return it then please. Thank you.

Him: Yes but I need to be sure that you will accept it as is and pay shipping back plus original payment. And as advise. you will need to pay much more for new mainboard, my neighbor has a one and he will replace it for very cheap. I will pay USD10 for not wasting time to ship it back and you need only pay 30

Ebay,"Problem With Buyer, Need Advise","My wife sold an item for $100 last week, The customer claims the item is a fake. This particular item is not known to have fakes as it isn't considered worth it. This is the last message she received from the buyer. 

I spoke with eBay and Paypal.....as well as law enforcement. I am not allowed to send a counterfeit item back....thru US Mail or by any means. I was told I had to turn it over to authorities. Of which I have done. It has been inspected and confiscated by authorities. It is up to you if you chose to refund me the $100 on your own that I paid and purchased in good faith under your wording, posting for sale and our messaging, that this item was a genuine guaranteed Fossil bag. This would indicate your good faith and you having no knowledge of this being counterfeit. If you chose not to, then it will be some time before I receive my refund, but I am told I eventually will. Again, this is up to you. Just will take time to process and send information back to eBay and Paypal that it has been confiscated due to being counterfeit. Then I am told all information will be turned over to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. 
I did not have to advise you of any of this. I was told it was up to me if I chose to advise you. However, I give everyone a chance to make a wrong.....right. This will be the last I will message you concerning this matter.

Can this buyer get a refund without sending the item back? Does she have to prove it's a fake?

Ebay,Item is damaged/not as described. can the seller ask me to pay the shipping costs? (ebay refund policy says they cant),"In the ""returning an item"" webpage, in the ""Refunds"" section, there is written ""*In these situations, the seller can't charge a restocking fee and the seller pays the return shipping charges.*"".  
Does that invalidate any kind of seller return policy where they say the buyer pays for shipping of returned items?",6,5,2017-09-30,EBAY,0.049026645720005035,0.9235130548477173,0.027460280805826187
Ebay,Sales dying off after about a month,"I try to sell my oil paintings on Ebay. I've tried this a few times over the past few years and each time, my sales die off after about 30 days. 

I start listing something every day, and I try to start low so I'll get good traffic. Usually I list small oil paintings starting at 99 cents. Some of them do well. I had one go up to 55 dollars and the seller still had to pay shipping on top of that. But now that I'm about 1.5 months in to this, my sales have significantly dropped off. I'm lucky if I get anything to break 10 dollars with most items now going for less than 5. 

Is this Cassini lowering my status? I don't understand why Ebay needs to punish me every time I try to sell.",12,4,2017-09-30,EBAY,0.24567867815494537,0.7069203853607178,0.04740090295672417
Ebay,Help I might have been scammed,[deleted],10,3,2017-09-30,EBAY,0.04070112109184265,0.8643068671226501,0.09499198198318481
Ebay,"Buyer payment showing up as pending in PayPal, but eBay says they haven't paid.","I sold a phone on eBay for ~$50, and it shows that the buyer paid within PayPal (shown as ""pending""). However, when I look on eBay it still says it has not been paid. PayPal tells me not to ship until the payment clears. It's been two days and it still hasn't. I'm uncomfortable shipping while eBay still says the item hasn't been paid. It does, however, say ""Payment was initialized on Sep 27, 2017 and is being processed through PayPal"". If I cancel the order in eBay will it refund the payment to the buyer, or just cause further complications? As far as I can see, there is no way for me to refund the buyer within PayPal. What are my options here?

Question Added: Should I tell the buyer I'm waiting for payment to clear if they ask why I've not sent the item?

Edit: Thanks for the responses so quickly. I'm not an avid seller on eBay, so I didn't know people paid other ways besides PayPal/Their bank. I just didn't want anything negative on my account from this. I've already had one person win the bid on this phone, then never paid, I wasn't sure if this person was doing the same. Either way, I'll wait the 7 days. Thanks again.",4,2,2017-09-30,EBAY,0.054524898529052734,0.9112952947616577,0.03417985513806343
