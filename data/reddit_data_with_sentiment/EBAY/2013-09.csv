Ebay,Need help with a problem (got scammed) neither ebay or paypal would help. Dont know what to do. Details in the comments.,I listed an iphone 4s for sale on ebay. After the bidding closed and the buyer posted the payment through paypal i sent the iphone to him. A few days later the buyers makes a claim that i have sent him the wrong item so i try contacting him to ask whats wrong and he tells me to not to try to contact him. Ebay then sends me an email that the buyer will send back the item and a refund to him will be issued. So far i dont mind since i would just post the item again on ebay. When i received the package back i was surprised that it wasnt the iphone i originally sent him but he sent me a broken old generation ipod. I tried contacting ebay and paypal but they both kept stalling and telling me they could do nothing. If anyone has been through the same experience can you give me and help on what to do?,5,3,2013-09-01,EBAY,0.14292265474796295,0.8237135410308838,0.03336375579237938

Ebay,Any tips to protect myself as a seller of a $300 sealed item?,"I just recently sold a $300 item and the buyer only has 1 feedback from last month. Anything you guys could recommend to keep me from getting screwed over in this deal?

The reason I ask is, I had a auction a couple years back where the buyer claimed the item I sent them wasn't the one listed in the auction. They disputed with Paypal who sided with them and I lost $150 in the deal due to them sending me back a completely different product (cellphone).

This item I sold is a sealed collectible (video game system) so if they open it and then decided to send it back saying it wasn't sealed, etc., what can I do as the sealed part holds the value? They have a whopping 1 feedback ($5 cellphone case) and I completely forgot to require 20+ feedback.

I took and showed 4 pictures of the system sealed, etc. which I used in the ad. Not sure what else I can do to try and thwart any type of shadiness arising from this.

Any suggestions my fellow Redditors? I have 856 feedback with 100% positive. Can they give me a negative if I cancel their sale after explaining that I really need someone with more history from eBay?",2,0,2013-09-01,EBAY,0.03358135372400284,0.9229559302330017,0.04346274212002754

Ebay,"Ebay amateur here, need advice on reporting seller","I recently purchased an amplifier (CX 404) for my home theater.  I have a few of the sames amps already and am an enthusiast.  I recently bought a used amp of the same model I currently own.  Was shipped to me no problem and arrived in a few days.

I turned it on and only the power turns on, not the actual transformer for each channel.  The fan's on the inside don't turn on etc and does not behave as my others, so it's defective even though the description says it has been tested thoroughly....Ok fine I'm disappointed and its a pain but I'll go through the motions to return it for a refund.  So I go fill out the form to send it back to get a refund.

His response was ""Seller's message:
""Hello, we are sorry to hear that the item was damaged in shipping. We will file a shipping claim for this item on Tuesday after the Labor Day holiday. Please pack the item back into the original packing material and into the original box. Please seal it and have it ready for possible pickup by USPS if necessary for the insurance claim. ""

I call complete bullshit and don't want to be apart of fraud to get an insurance claim.  It was packed very well, and no way can USPS damage it where it turns on but the internal transformers don't.  I want to report them to ebay but can't find an easy way to do this.  I know if I just shut up and return it I'll get my money back but I find it ridiculous that was his message to me when I did not mention anything about damaged during shipping only that the product was defective and not as described nor tested.

I don't know if this is common place or what to expect.

Any advice on how to move forward or if its even worth it?

Ebay,Buyer expresses interest in buying more items from me but hasn't given positive feedback on previous sale.,"Sold some stuff via a BIN and buyer expressed interest in purchasing the rest of my stock. I told them that I was considering putting the rest of what I had up as an auction instead, but that I'd let them know when I listed the remaining items.

Parcel was delivered late last week but the buyer said they would be out of town until after the recent Labor Day weekend so in theory they've only had two days to look at the contents. On the same day that they said they would be back home I contacted the buyer and said I was going to put up more listings but that they should only purchase if they were completely satisfied with the items they already bought (the new ones would be in similar condition).

Now I'm a bit worried though, because the buyer replied within minutes saying they would definitely buy more, but they haven't yet given me positive feedback from the previous sale. I know I can't demand that they give me feedback, but is it okay to ask that they don't purchase from me again until they do? The stuff I'm selling is in loose, used condition and it's entirely possible for them to mix the stuff together and I would not be able to tell if they sent some of it back.

Hi. just got email from FedEx stating that the item was damaged in shipment and is being returned to you. would you please process a refund at this time. Thanks. I will leave positive feedback. the package never even made it to my door.

I was never notified by fedex. When i searched the tracking it doesn't mention it.

Friday, Sep 6, 2013 	NORTH SALT LAKE, UT 	Departed FedEx location
Thursday, Sep 5, 2013 	NORTH SALT LAKE, UT 	Arrived at FedEx location


This item was packaged very well, and after shipping nearly a thousand items I didn't skimp with it. Plastic wrap, bubble wrap, surrounded by sheet foam and 2"" of peanuts. It is a $400 item and it was fully insured. 

Has anyone went through the claim process? any advice would be fantastic right now. I'll log in later tonight to read anything here. Thank you for reading through such a long post...

Ebay,The eBay scam that wasn't?,"I won a bid for a computer peripheral at what seemed like a good price (half the $1k new price) only for the seller to write me and say that they'd damaged the item while packing and wanted to cancel the transaction.

However there wasn't much I could do about that so I agreed to cancel the transaction if they refunded me, which they did.

So I got my money back and cancelled the transaction. That should be the end of it, right? Except that before canceling they'd messaged me a tracking number for a delivery. When I asked about it, they said it was just a glitch in the system. After cancelling, the ""glitch"" was delivered to me and turned out to be an apparently new and fully functional version of the item I bid on.

Or is the 20% off only applicable for the final value fee for the item?

For example, say I sell an item for $67.95. My final value fee is $3.60 and my final value fee on shipping is 0.48 for a total of $4.08. Will my total fees after the 20% discount be $4.08 * 0.8 = $3.26 or will it be equal to ($3.60 * 0.8) + 0.48 = $3.36?

Ebay,Best Offer Buyers are becoming a headache!! I wish the item stayed for sale until payment is received...,"I buy stuff at auctions and sell on eBay, I list my stuff as Buy it Now or Best Offer. It generally works great for me, but I'm seeing more and more people send me offers that I accept (or they accept my counter offers) and then never come up with the money. 3 items in the last 2 weeks have done this. 

One says her Paypal won't work so needs to pull out of the deal (this is after buying the item then when I chased her up for the money says she gets paid in a week so can pay me then!), one is just flat out ignoring any messages or the case I have opened, and the other ignored my messages for a week then when I opened a case just sent a message saying ""sorry put offer on wrong item""

I guess people send me offers assuming I'll decline, then when I accept they realise they didn't actually want the item at all.

I sell a lot of Laptops, and in this category eBay offer the 'still for sale until buyer has paid' system which works great! You can accept multiple offers and it only 'sells' when the item is paid for.

But the items I'm having problems with are in the 'Business and Industrial' category, which currently does not allow you to use this system! Why not!!?? It works great!

It's so annoying now, I have 8+ watchers on an item with a few offers, I accept one of them, then wait a week and a half to re-list it again due to a time waster. When re-listed I lose my watchers and have to start all over again!!

It's so frustrating, I hope eBay plan on adopting this system in all categories in the future!!

Ebay,What is the current state of affairs with virtual currencies?,"I have heard so, so much conflicting information regarding this.

It is no secret it is difficult to sell virtual goods on ebay due to chargebacks...and this is why it is not completely safe for sellers to sell for example bitcoins on ebay.

Here's the interesting part.  I discovered on /r/bitcoin that apparently bitcoin sales were previously excluded from ebay explicitly, which just changed.  Now virtual currencies are apparently not explicitly disallowed...there are many listings for bitcoin currently on ebay.  Is this the case?  I cannot really confirm anything about the previous statement except that Ebay's policy on virtual good is [vague](http://www.ebay.com/gds/Buying-and-Selling-Virtual-Items-on-eBay-/10000000004609906/g.html).

I did an experiment and made two small sales of bitcoin on ebay.  What I did is required a lengthy process whereby the buyer confirms they have access to the bitcoin wallet by confirming and returning small trial deposits...1 out of the 2 sales was a scam  buyer who never completed my verification and simply initiated a chargeback...the other went fine and I received feedback. 

This does not exclude the possibility of an ""unauthorized transaction"" claim which would make the seller of bitcoin completely SOL.

So, in summary...my question is, what is ebay's stance, and has anyone heard what ebay and payal are saying about this problem?  In my eyes, they should not sit back and watch as a typical scam plays out on ebay this often and do nothing about it.  It would not be out of the question to design a way to thwart this scam so that bitcoins could be traded on ebay, as well as other virtual items which present great risk to sellers.",0,2,2013-09-10,EBAY,0.09680990129709244,0.8808459043502808,0.022344253957271576

Ebay,"Ebay awarded me full refund after item arrived a month late, do I have to return the item?","I bought some limited edition vans and got them for a bargain price, so I know they made a loss, was meant to be first class delivery.

 2weeks later not arrived, messaged seller, no reply so opened a case.

They replied to case saying they posted it weeks ago. I offered to call my depo and they then said they had 'been to post office' and the item 'had a problem' so would resend it the next day. 2weeks later it finally arrives with yesterdays postmark. all my messages in the case asking what was happening/what the problem was/tracking info/proof postage were ignored.

I then raised it to ebay asking for postage refund as paid a lot for 1st class and didn't get it for over 4weeks and they clearly only posted it because I complained and the day of the postmark.
Stated I had got the item finally and was happy to keep it.

Ebay then refunded the entire item+postage through paypal.


Do I have to send the shoes back? I really don't want to, I'd pay for them I love them! Then again seller clearly a liar who tried to get away with never sending them so why do I feel bad?

I clearly told ebay I received the item and wanted to keep it as part of the escalation **before** I asked for a *postage* refund. Ebay gave me a full refund 'for your inconvenience' and closed the case. There is no mention from ebay on if I should return, so I would have to re-open the case to ask this.

**Further to this.** I am a seller too and 12months ago someone complained that a 'used' item I sent them had 'some wear and tear' they refused a partial refund from me, and ebay gave them a full refund.

Ebay,My First eBay Scam,"Well, after over a decade of buying stuff on eBay, I think I might have finally experienced getting scammed for the first time.  I'm posting this to see if anyone has any tips, etc on what to do.

I purchased an item a week and a half ago, Buy It Now, and paid via PayPal (obviously, and I use my CC for my PP account).  This was Saturday of Labor Day weekend so I could understand a few days of delay but I've yet to receive my item.  More than that, I've had zero communication from the seller or any responses to my messages that I've sent them.  After this weekend, I checked eBay again and saw an updated arrival date of yesterday (9/9/13) but when I got home from work, the item wasn't here.  I decided to let eBay and the seller know I hadn't received the item and a case was opened for me by eBay.  When I got home today, I still hadn't received my item and thought I'd do a little investigative work.

I took the photo from the auction and put it into Google reverse image search and the first two links were a Flickr account and a private forum where a person was selling this same item, same picture but advertised it a few months ago.  This particular item was a piece of electronic gear that displays some information about where it's operating.  This information was displayed on the screen of the item on both the eBay auction and the private site I found as they were the same picture.  It is highly unlikely that someone in Florida (where the eBay seller is supposedly located) would have information for Missouri coming up on the display of this item.

With this in mind, I called eBay and spoke to a customer service rep about it.  He told me how to add the information I've found to my case although he may have inadvertently had me send the information I've found to the seller.  He instructed me to go to the Resolution Center link at the top of the page, click See case details on my current case, and add the information that way.  I did this just in case the information I found via Google today couldn't be found again and just so it would be on file.  While I was on the phone with the rep, he told me he hadn't seen any correspondence between myself and the seller.  But either way, I have to wait a few days until the time on the case runs out before I can pursue action with eBay/Paypal and get my money back.

Sorry for this being so wordy.  Anyways, I'm wondering if I've done anything wrong here or if I'm pursuing this in the right way.  Are there any suggestions anyone can make to me in regards to this case?  Is the process for getting your money back via PayPal relatively painless and if I have little recourse through them, is it advisable to go through my CC company and get my money back that way as a last resort?

I'm sure this goes without saying to most eBay veterans but I've learned from this to look at most auctions a lot closer.  There was nothing on this particular auction that looked fishy to me; the layout was professional and the seller had excellent feedback.  They also had previously sold items similar to what I bought that are technical in nature and not necessarily popular pieces of equipment, they're just expensive.  I really wouldn't have gotten suspicious at first glance unless I put the auction image into reverse image search.

**Edit TL;DR:** Bought an item on eBay, it hasn't arrived.  I opened a case on it and discovered the auction photos were from someone else's private sale.  I just want to make sure I'm pursuing this the correct way.",7,5,2013-09-11,EBAY,0.059170182794332504,0.9117310047149658,0.02909887209534645

Ebay,I got scammed out of my giftcards.,"I'm mostly posting this just for others to be aware and hopefully it'll prevent someone else from falling for the same mistake. 

I found two iTunes gift cards while cleaning a few weeks back and decided to sell them on Ebay. The first auctions were just bids only, which on both the bidders made huge bids ($60 for a $50 gift card, $41 for a $25). I knew I was going to get paid so I opened up the cases in the Resolution Center and those closed pretty quietly. 

I decided to relist the gift cards, this time with a Buy Now price equal to the amount on the card. Within hours, both cards were purchased by the same customer and paid. He requested that I send the codes to him via message, which I - stupidly - did. 

I woke up this morning to e-mails from Paypal saying the customer has now requested a refund. Both cards have been used. I sent Paypal screenshots of the messages the buyer and myself exchanged and also that the gift card codes were now unavailable. I doubt that I will get any payment since Paypal asked for shipping proof, which I can't provide because it's a strictly online transaction. 

I was not aware of the fact that the payments on Paypal were not available at the time of the buyer's purchase and I'm kicking myself for waiting until the payments actually went through. 

Moral of the story: Don't send gift card codes online until Paypal gives you access to the payments. :(",4,2,2013-09-12,EBAY,0.0374317541718483,0.9285796880722046,0.03398848697543144

Ebay,eBay Unfairly Collecting Fees On Overpayments,"I know this may not apply to many sellers, but it's something I have to get off my chest...

How many sellers are aware the eBay is unfairly charging fees on money that you don't keep?

Here is our situation... We sell live fish on eBay, meaning that overnight shipping required, and it is expensive (we charge $35 per shipment).  Because it is so expensive, people want to combine multiple items into one shipment.  Some customers will combine dozens of different items into one shipment.  

As eBay is setup primarily for single item purchases, we get lots and lots of buyers who pay for each item immediately, and send us $35 for shipping with each item they pay for.  **eBay charges us fees of ~10% on each and every shipping payment of $35, and keeps the fees even after we refund the $35 back to the customer.**

We have literally a few hundred overpayments each month, with each overpayment costing us around $3 in fees, resulting in $600-1000 in lost profit per month, depending on the time of year.  Fees for money that we never keep.  Fees that eBay is keeping unfairly.

It's bullshit, and I know nothing will be done about it.  Just wanted to vent.

tl;dr - Customers unknowingly pay us too much, eBay charges us fees on overpayment and keeps fees even after money is refunded to the customer.",17,2,2013-09-12,EBAY,0.08598704636096954,0.8785849809646606,0.03542797639966011

Ebay,I'm done getting screwed by selling on Ebay. Here's my rant from a Newbie.,"Prepare for rant:

To start, let me say that I am by no means an experienced eBay seller, but I think that makes this an even bigger deal. I know that eBay is established as one of the biggest online retailers, with probably tens of thousands of people buying and selling every single day, so eBay must have done something right. But as a new seller when I went to sell something on eBay, I felt that eBay did a very poor job on educating me about how to properly sell on eBay.

I have sold a few things here and there over the past several years, but this was by far the most expensive things I was selling. I listed a brand new unopened [Ouya gaming console](https://www.ouya.tv/). This was just after the Ouya had been launched to the public for $99. The version I was selling was one of the Kickstarter versions, still sealed in the box.

When I initially went to list the item, I could have sworn that I set it to be shipped only within the US. Being the Newbie I am, apparently that did not happen. Instead, the one and only person who bid and won the item was somebody from Argentina.

At this point, I could have been a jerk and simply chose not to ship to him. Of course, I didn't want to do that, so I obliged. I emailed the buyer directly informing him of the mixup, and that if he still wanted the device, I would be happy to ship to him, but would have to charge more for shipping ($30 vs. $10). He understood, so I used eBay's shipping system to calculate the cost of shipping to Argentina. So as to not drive the shipping cost up like crazy, I simply decided to go with the cheapest international shipping method, First-Class Package International Service. As a newbie to eBay shipping, this turned out to be a BIG mistake. Yes, it was my choice, but I believe eBay did an **extremely** poor job of informing of 2 things:

1. First-Class Package International Service does not include tracking outside of the US

2. You should **always** get tracking on international packages

I realize that it is the seller's own choice/responsibility to choose the shipping method that will get the item to the buyer, but to my uninformed self, I thought I had done just that. I assumed that shipping internationally was no different from shipping domestically, in that the only real difference in prices is how quickly the package will arrive. I assumed that all international shipments (especially when shipped directly through eBay's system) would have tracking. Yes, I made a lot of assumptions, but as a new seller, I still feel like all of this should have been **a lot** clear throughout the entire process.

So anyways, fast forward by a month. The initial arrival estimate was about a month post shipping. I had been checking the tracking...no luck. The buyer then reached out to me, the package had not arrived. I felt badly, but I said lets wait another week. Still...nothing.

At that point, I was a bit concerned. So I reached out to USPS directly to check in on the status. This was the very first time I was **ever** informed that the shipping method I had selected did not include international tracking. Again, maybe I should have looked into this, but I still feel like eBay could have made this a lot clearer. What USPS had told me that if the package has not been received after 30 days, it can be assumed the item has either been lost or stolen, especially for a shipment Internationally. Suffice to say, I was not all too pleased with finding this out. And considering I used the cheapest method, they had no way to even request receipt of delivery from Argentina. Essentially, USPS said that their records show that it left the US, but Argentina Postal Service doesn't have a record of the item ever arriving (the buyer looked into this).

So finally after waiting 6 weeks and still no item, the buyer checked in with me one last time. I will give the buyer the benefit of the doubt and assume that he didn't receive it (since I clearly don't have the proper tracking to prove it one way or the other), and I acknowledged that the next logical step would be to open up a case with eBay. Now I do my fair share of purchasing online through Amazon and other online retailers, and I have never had a major issue like this, but they have always been so generous and understanding. In fact, once I had ordered something through Apple which never arrived (I believe it may have even said ""Delivered"", but it really never wasn't), and Apple was very apologetic and sent me the item again. I was shocked and really grateful for the awesome customer service! Unfortunately, that was not the case here with eBay, even though shipping is a major aspect of their business.

So I let the case go through and do it's thing, and all of a sudden, I get an email that the buyer has been refunded $129.99...**FROM ME**. Now maybe this is standard for eBay, but I was stunned. I had done everything right. I listed the item. I was nice enough to ship internationally. I provided the only tracking number I was provided. What more could I do?

At this point, I contact eBay. Oh joy. After being on hold for a good half hour+, I finally got a hold of somebody. After listening to my story, they forwarded me to the appeals department. Now I must say, the couple of people I have spoken to have all been very nice, but that doesn't mean I am happy with what happened. Every person I spoke to agreed that it was a very unfortunate situation and that ""[I] did everything right"", but the fact that it simply never showed up as delivered, they have to side with the buyer every time. Sure I get that. And in all reality, it is USPS' fault, right? Well no! Since they say that it has left the US, they claim it is not their responsibility anymore. So naturally, this shit storm comes down on me.

As the responsible buyer who ""did everything right"" (quote from eBay rep), I had to pay the buyer back. So now I don't have the item nor the $130.

I am by no means saying that this is eBay's fault directly, but seeing as I am using their service, it is most certainly their fault! I entrusted eBay to help me sell my item. I even used the shipping system built right into eBay. They clearly have some sort of a partnership with USPS, so why can't they go talk to them for the money? I know the Postal Service is struggling, but I'd bet they still have more money to spend than I do.

Anways, in summary...I am just really frustrated with eBay. The selling process is not very clear for a new seller like myself, and although they have the ""Seller Protection Plan"" in place, I really do not feel very protected. If you read this far, +4 Bonus Points. Thanks for listening to my rant.

**TLDR**: eBay has terrible education materials for new sellers, and I got baited into shipping a package internationally without the proper tracking, and now had to pay the buyer $130 for an item I clearly shipped.

Ebay,Are there any actual eBay employees in this sub? I desperately need one.,"This is my Hail Mary / last attempt. I can provide more information if I can actually locate and converse with an eBay employee but after 3 lengthy phone calls I don't know what else to do. 

Here are the key points: 

1. 100% feedback seller. 

2. Seller for 7 years. 

3. 2 months ago I had a communication issue and missed a handful of transactions via my iphone malfunctioning. It was immediately corrected but my communication &amp; shipping time stars were dinged. 

4. Power Seller up until about 2 months ago. 

5. Account was literally shut down / restricted this morning. eBay closed my store / took down all 112 of my listings. 

4. 4 phone calls &amp; 2 supervisors, no definitive answers and no one that could help. Was informed I could buy on ebay but would no longer be permitted to sell. Ever. 

Please. I'm literally begging. This is my hobby, thank god not my life line because if so, I'd be screwed but I'm not ready to be done with ebay entirely; I have boxes of holiday inventory ready for christmas. I love vintage everything and I have lived ebay for SEVEN YEARS. I need help. PLease, some kind of insight.

I message him back saying that I wouldn't have bought the item if the shipping was that expensive and ask for the transaction to just be cancelled. 

No response. The next day I file a Paypal dispute asking for the transaction to be cancelled or the item sent.

""I spent $130 on shipping your item to you. You file a complaint. You have a lot of nerve. I have nothing else to say besides you better back off your complaint.""

What should I do? Should I message him back through ebay or just silently wait out the dispute? Should I tell ebay that I'm being threatened?

Ebay,eBay Buyer trying to scam seller. Help me!,"I sold a purse for $975 on August 21st, 2013. On August 22nd, 2013, I sent the item out with delivery confirmation with USPS. Also, I uploaded this confirmation number for the buyer. On August 29th, 2013, the item was delivered to her residence. On September 4th, the buyer indicated to me that she never received the item. I advised that it stated the package was successfully delivered on August 29th, 2013 and that she should have known when the package was coming in, as she had access to the delivery confirmation number. The buyer kept insisting she never received the item. I contacted USPS and the USPS Investigation Team advised me the item was successfully delivered. They even talked to the mail carrier who remembers delivering it to the buyer's residence and handing it to someone who lived in the house! ALSO, one of the USPS Investigation Team even mentioned the fact that he believes she is scamming me. He said he was an avid eBay seller and supposedly eBay has a signature confirmation requirement for items of a specific value, and since I did not do that, she is trying to take advantage of me. I asked if he would be willing to help me out with this matter and he advised that I could use all the information he provided to rectify this situation. The buyer opened a case and only keeps mentioning this signature confirmation issue. I don't know what to do. I called eBay and they are stating they will vote in favor of the buyer!

Ebay,Buyer paid and now wants to cancel transaction - Help!,"Yesterday I posted my friend's iPhone on ebay for a decent price, and it sold within a few hours via the Buy it Now option.  Immediate payment was received.  I was planning on shipping the phone out this morning.

I wake up to the following message from buyer:

""I want to cancel a transaction there is some problem is going on on my card that's why i want to cancel this transaction.""

The payment went through to my paypal already.  What should I do?  Do I ship the iPhone anyway?  Will he be able to get his money back from me?  The LAST thing I want to do is send it anyway, and then have him end up getting his money back AND gettting/keeping the phone.  

The problem with just refunding his money, canceling the transaction and posting it again is that my friend already used the money to pay a bill, via my Paypal debit card, and I don't have the money to refund the transaction from my bank account, at least not until payday. 

Thanks in advance for any helpful suggestions.  



Edit:  After giving it some thought, I am considering just re-listing the phone for three days, and issuing a refund once the money is received from the new sale.  That's probably the only way I can assure that I won't lose both the phone and the money.

Edit 2: after speaking with eBay, they suggested that I send the phone (with signature required) since the transaction went through and I've been paid. They said the buyer can reject the package if he doesn't want it, and I will have to issue a refund once it's returned to me, or he can send the phone back and open a return claim with eBay.

Ebay,Potential scam or just idiot buyer?,"I recently sold a used iPhone 4 on eBay to a Brazilian guy.

A month later he has lodged a dispute stating that the item doesn't work (it definitely does), the box was damaged and that the import duty was too high so he refused delivery.

Now obviously if he refused to pay import duty then he can't have opened the package or checked the phone, so he's clearly lying.

My suspicion is that he hadn't considered import tax and simply refused the item, making up the box damage and broken phone as excuses.

Ebay,Helping Drop-Shipping Wantrepreneurs,"For all you novice drop-shipping newbies, I'm exiting the drop-shipping business and I am getting rid of my personal business. I'm moving into bigger and better things. 

Because of this, I am willing to share my contacts, suppliers, and system of automation.

I've been running a drop-shipping system in a couple niches using an automated lister, and an Ebay pricing management app so that my only interaction with selling is doing the actual shipping. You can list thousands of items and manage them with this Ebay app for about a penny per listing, and with it you can control the parameters like min/max price. 

If you are a veteran Ebay seller, I can provide you with a fantastic app that lets you control your listings, set prices according to your parameters, and is cheap compared to the time spent on upkeep for thousands of listings. Increase your selling efficiency while decreasing the time investment. 

If you want to get into drop-shipping I will give you the contacts. I will not give each person the same contacts because flooding the market is counterproductive. 

I have no stake with any of these suppliers, I am not an employee or salesmen for any of these suppliers. If you want to get into drop-shipping message me and I will give you the knowledge I've acquired. I can only provide contacts and knowledge. This is not a guarantee of success. You will have to work, explore options, manage product lines, and seek out sales. 

Also, not validating myself for the ""Prove you're successful"" crowd. This isn't a pissing contest. If you don't want my information, don't take it.",0,1,2013-09-16,EBAY,0.039062052965164185,0.929781973361969,0.03115604817867279

He should at least return the iPad if he is not going to use it. What can I do? What should I do? I feel like this is not only unfair but illegal as well because I feel like I just got scammed.

Ebay,Getting buyers to leave feedback,"I see some people leave feedback for buyers upon payment with the rationale that once paid for, the buyer has fulfilled their obligation. This makes sense to me, but seems to lead to buyers forgetting to return feeback later after receiving their item.

So I started leaving feedback for my buyers after they left feedback for me, but that didn't seem to increase the likelihood of getting return feedback. 

For a while I was requesting feedback with a note saying, ""glad to see your item has arrived. Please leave feedback for me so that I can know all is well and I will return the favor."" Per advice found in this sub, I've stopped doing that because it invites the chance of getting a negative where you otherwise had nothing.

My new tack is to watch the tracking, wait for it to indicate the item has been delivered, and then leave feedback for the buyer. So far it seems to be increasing the amount of feedbacks I get in return from my buyers.

Is anyone else here using a similar strategy? How have your results been?",5,0,2013-09-17,EBAY,0.04578128084540367,0.9123735427856445,0.04184518754482269

Ebay,So how do you guys decide what time/day to post stuff? and when to use a buy it now?,"So i buy storages, and do my weekly yard sales and resell everything small/collectible on ebay. I've been trying to post between the hours of 12-4pm Pacific standard time because those seems to be the hours that make the most sense. but i'm curious if posting during the night/dead hours might be better simply because there are less items ending, and people see your item for longer periods of time, rather than mixed in with a bunch of items ending in a minute.



Do you guys pay the extra 10 cents and set schedules? It would be nice to post things all night when I run out of time to post during the day. but I'm not sure if it's worth paying the extra 10 cents. How does everyone else feel about it?

Ebay,Good til Cancelled Listings; How eBay Could Improve Them,"I have 10+ good til cancelled listings and I sell accessories for the iphone 5 and I wanted to add ""iphone 5 &amp; 5S"" to the listing title but obviously once an item has been sold or bid on, you can no longer change the title.

How good til cancelled listings work, is that they're automatically renewed every 30 days, so you don't have to do it manually and you can keep the sales history, which makes the listings look much better.

However you can't change the title, even once the listing renews so you're paying a new listing fee but you can't edit the title, how is that fair?

I understand why they these rules but surely exceptions should exist. It is extremely backwards to not be able to change the titles in legitimate circumstances.

Having spoken to ebay customer service people, their stock answers of ""just start a new listing"" really misses the point. I use good til cancelled listings so I don't have to start new listings, so I can keep my sales history.

Ebay,So how hard did I just get scammed?,"fucking ebay deadbeats.

Posted an auction for my account credentials for Sunday Ticket on DirecTV for the rest of the season (15 more weeks).  Guy wins and paypals immediately.  I email him the account credentials and within 10 minutes he changes the account over to his email address (same email address he used to paypal/ebay..so at least there is a link)

20 minutes later I get an ebay message stating ""Please email me the account credentials through ebay as it is more secure"" .  I respond that I have already emailed and have records that he has already changed the account.  A couple more back and forths where I ask him to confirm he has received and changed the account (he won't of course).  He then sends me this link:  http://ebay.com/help/policies/downloadable.html

I can't retrieve the account from DirecTV due to it being a promotion.  So it's pretty much his.

At some point my guess is that he'll open up some kind of complaint and I'm sure ebay/paypal will side with him.

Ebay,As a seller I am very let down by Ebays policies regarding feedback. This has got to be as bad as it gets...,"So about a month ago I start an auction for a used Skyrim game. Simple enough, except the buyer refused to pay. After a few days I proceed with a non payment case and relist the item. After about a month the buyer does not respond to the case and I receive notice that I will not receive Final value fee credit and on top of that the buyer leaves NEGATIVE feedback stating quote (this is the entire feedback) ""tries to force you to pay"" !!!, The audacity.

I just called Ebay thinking that this is a clear cut case of a malicious user that can be cleared up by their reps. The first rep I spoke with explained that because I didnt manually close my non pay case and the buyer did not respond, the case expired and I did not receive a credit automatically. The rep ended up issuing me the credit and said she would have to transfer me in the matter of the negative feedback which I was given. This is where it gets sad..

The specialist that soon came on who btw sounded like a robot with an indian accent said that they COULD NOT REMOVE it and all I could do was post a response to my feedback back!! This was due to the fact that I did not manually close the non pay case. Eventhough the buyer clearly did not pay, did not respond, they were still able to leave me negative feedback. (My first out of 85) Also because I didnt close this case the bad buyer gets no reprocussion, no strike and sellers cant leave negative feedback whatsoever, whats up with that?

Its been about 2 hours since I dealt with these reps and tried to get this cleared up and I am still pretty discouraged. I try hard to do stuff very fast and be a good ebay user so having a scarred feedback because of something like this really bothers me.

Ebay,Suspicious Buyer for iPhone. Not sure how to proceed.,"Today I listed my iPhone 5 on eBay as an auction with a buy it now price. About 3-4 hours into the auction I get an email telling me it had been sold at the buy it now price, initially I think brilliant as that price was about the peak I thought I could get for it.

I want the item posted via Pack and Send Courier International to Her, I will be paying you for the item via PayPal or Bank Transfer, get back to me on BUYERSEMAILADDRESS@nokiamail.com with your bank details and PayPal ID so i can pay for the item as soon as possible.

*Followed by an American Address in Alabama*

First of all, why the hell would someone offer to pay $150 MORE then my Buy it now price. Secondly, I'm fairly sure the 4G/LTE bands don't match up properly from Australia to the USA and therefore the iPhone may not work as well as it should. 

Should I contact them and query the amount, as well as explain the 4G/LTE situation to ensure that isn't an issue? I've also checked the buyers feedback to discover they haven't had any since 2010, and their current rating is 0. 

I have replied to the buyer Re: the antenna issues that may arise and am awaiting a response but this whole situation just seems a little dodgy to me.

Ebay,"I just had a buyer open a case, advice?","Background:

Over the summer I have been selling a lot of items on behalf of my girlfriends dad, it has been mostly photography equipment or hifi equipment ranging between £100 and £200, I have sold about 20 items in total, and received positive feedback from half of them, the other half simply didn't leave any feedback.

I recently sold an item for about £45 and the buyer complained the item is in a bad condition, this is simply not true, the item has been used twice before we sold it.

I do not offer returns officially, but I did give the buyer the option to return the item for a full refund, I also offered to pay her postage cost, once i had seen a picture of the proof of postage.

This was not good enough for the buyer, instead the buyer has demanded £15 for a replacement part, in the form of opening a case. 

From what I can tell now, my options are to either pay the money (I really don't want to give a penny to this buyer as i know the item was in great condition), or risk ebay billing me the money and mark my account negatively.

My questions for you are as follows:

* What will happen to my account if the case is closed in the buyers favour?

* How will ebay decide how to close the case? In all of my past listings I have listed any damage and taken close up images, so that looks good for me right?

* What do you think I should do? I really don't want my account to be suspended or anything, and the £15 the buyer has requested wouldn't break the bank, on the other hand, I would be handing out money to a scammer.",7,1,2013-09-24,EBAY,0.04712115600705147,0.9149901866912842,0.03788863867521286

Ebay,"Hit the buyer trifecta: New to eBay, old, and technologically clueless. And she managed to call my mother to complain.","Couple weeks ago I sold a home phone handset for $15 shipped. I tested it and it worked before shipping, was basically brand new. New buyer had 0 feedback, but that happens often enough I don't worry about it.

Today, I get a text from my mother saying that she got 2 voice mails on HER home phone from a crazy sounding old woman ranting that I sold her a 'broken phone' and if I didn't help her to 'set it up' she was going to contact paypal. I don't use my parent's phone number for eBay. Never had.  I had a different crazy buyer pull my eBay phone number and call me on my own number like 2 months ago when he wanted to cancel a purchase he had just made so I knew my phone number was accurate on eBay. (I double checked it anyways and its correct)

So I look up on paypal and my mother's number was the one I originally had used to sign up with paypal like 13 years ago and was still on my account along with my current cell number. My cell was listed as Primary Cell, and my mother's number as Primary Home. I've since deleted my mother's number, obviously.

No idea how the buyer got that number. No notification from Paypal that she had requested my info (Can you even do that?) And I don't think my phone number is given out when someone pays. I don't get sellers phone numbers when I pay, anyways.

Ebay,"Buyer leaves neutral feedback, I try to resolve the issue but she is unwilling?","Howdy,

 A little while ago I sold a Sony Walkman MP3 player on eBay, besides the normal wear and tear marks it was a good device and worked just fine. I formatted the device before I shipped it out, I then put a random album (non relevant: Bob Marley, who doesn't like?) to make sure it still played after formatting it, which it did.

I ship the item via USPS priority mail, I get tracking and insurance and shipping confirmation. I paid for the shipping at the post so I had to manually enter the tracking number into my eBay for that item so the buyer could see it. I message the buyer telling them I had dropped the package off at the post and gave them the tracking number, and left the usual ""let me know if you have any questions or issues"". 

So 4 days pass, I notice via tracking that the item has arrived at its destination address, I noticed that the buyer had not left feedback yet so I message her asking her if she received her item if she was pleased etc. Well 2 days later she leaves neutral feedback stating; ""item did not ship fast as promised, never gave tracking information"". Then she sent me a message saying that ""it doesn't work"", I try multiple times to communicate with her and she doesn't respond, I finally tell her I will refund her item and pay for shipping if she just sends it back. A couple days later she finally responds she wants a full refund and wants shipping covered, I'm like OK. SO being the dumba$$ I am, I eagerly refund her money and pay an additional ten bucks to cover the shipping.

Well weeks go by I never received my MP3 and despite multiple attempts to contact, she never responds. I then proceeded to open a case with eBay to try and at least get the neutral feedback removed if that's even possible, I explained my case basically like I've done here... well that was months ago now and I never heard anything... now I am left with this ugly gray feedback in my history.

What are we sellers supposed to do in these situations? I really wanted to help the buyer but they seemed like they didn't want to help themselves! I'm pretty sure they were just trying to screw me over but I didn't care, I just didn't want my feedback harmed... And the more I use eBay the more I realize how catered it is to buyers and how it seems to screw sellers over more than often even though it has to be sellers where they get the majority of their money? I love eBay and don't want to stop selling, but its things like these that really discourage me. I guess I should be thankful I at least did not get a negative.

Ebay,"Bought wedding dress (NWOT) and after the seller marked it as shipped, they messaged and told me the dress had a 10 inch stain on it!","This past weekend I found my wedding dress online. The seller marked it as NWOT and the payment process went through fine. The pictures (even up close) looked fine. Yesterday they marked the dress as shipped and sent me a tracking number. This morning I got a message telling me that the dress had a ten inch stain on the front and that they were sorry. They would give me a 50% discount (I think they meant refund) OR 25% off another purchase from their store. 

I want to know is what I can do at this point. I really like the dress, but I am really upset that I was misled about the whole thing. When I asked them about the stain on the dress they said:

""It is quite large on the upper and mid section of the front skirt. The only way to fix it would be to take a seam out, and lift skirt to create couple of pleats, but even with this you would not be able to totally hide it .the stain itself is not very visible, it is more like that part has no sheen the rest of dress has and personally I don't think it is wearable unless you do extensive repairs.""

Thoughts? I'm not an avid Ebay user and I saw the filing a dispute feature. What can I expect from that? Assuming I can do something to remove the stain (keeping the dress) what are my options for a higher refund? Am I completely SOL and would be stuck with the 50%?

TL;DR Bought wedding dress online marked as NWOT. Seller informed me after dress was shipped that the dress has a huge stain on the front.

UPDATE: Just got my full refund and the seller said that they never would have shipped to a ""person like me."" I'm filing a report with ebay.",12,3,2013-09-26,EBAY,0.07890719920396805,0.8826063871383667,0.03848642855882645
Ebay,Buyer found the same item cheaper. Troubles begin.,"9/11: Sold a coin book.

Should I wait to get the item to respond to the feedback?

Ebay,Buyer claiming product not as described 4 months after delivery,"Hi everyone,

I had sold a camera on Ebay 4 months ago.

- 4 months later the buyer is emailing me back stating the shutter is no longer functioning (due to high shutter count). The buyer believes i did not provide her with the right shutter count number and she is not happy with the condition of the product.

- considering 4 months has passed (I believe ebay protection covers items for 45 days after purchase), does the buyer have a valid case? From my perspective, i have no idea how many shutter actuations the seller has put on the camera since receiving it and if the condition was ruined. 

Any help would be useful.

Well, the item is a ""washable filter"", and it states that on the packaging.  I respond with:

&gt;I don't know what the problem is, the package clearly says it's washable, did you follow any directions given to you on the packaging as to how to wash it?

I did a little back and forth with the customer, and she was having an issue with Paypal.

No problem, she says she'll call Paypal today, I'm sure they'll sort it out for her. Cut to, her still not being able to pay. Now I'm really worried it's a problem on my end. I call Ebay, they say it's not me. I call Paypal, they say it's not me. I realize my bank account is not linked to my Paypal account and try that.

Finally, she calls Paypal again, talks to someone else, and he manually puts her order through. This whole process from beginning to end took 18 HOURS.

Ebay,Any rules of thumb for figuring out shipping prices?,"I often encounter items of various shapes, sizes and weights, and it's quite laborious putting the dimensions and weight of every single item into the USPS calculator to figure out if it's worth selling on eBay.

I know that USPS offers flat rate shipping with boxes that are small, medium, and large. But often that's not the best deal, and some things can't fit in even the large flat rate shipping box (which is 12x12x8).

My current rule for things that are small and appear to be less than 13 ounces is that they will cost around $4 to ship. For medium-size things that are less than 2 pounds and less than 12 inches on all sides I guess that they will cost about $8. I have never shipped things that are more than 2 pounds or more than 12 inches on any side, so I don't really know how much it would be. But I would figure it would be something around $16.

There's no way I'm going to rip it out of my phone and return it to China for a refund but I don't want to give positive feedback. What would you do?",1,0,2013-09-29,EBAY,0.1632087677717209,0.7995657920837402,0.03722535818815231

Ebay,Recent sales suffering,"My dad has been selling collectables (mainly coins and stamps) on eBay for 5 or so years, maybe even more. He's seen every scammer make a killing and we've seen a lot of funny stuff, but his sales numbers were never really bad or impacted by them. Recently though, the scammers in the market seem to have almost total market share. Selling identical products, where his is cheaper than the alternative, he has almost no sales and almost no page views compared to the market leader. 

For the last 6 or so months, I think he's been getting screwed by the best match algorithm (he doesn't show up on the first page) for all his listings. He's a bit older so his ads are very simple and gaudy, but his pictures are decent and his products are good.

I think I need to take over and optimize his listings and help him become more modern and hopefully robust, but I'm not really sure where to start. I'd appreciate any advice you have or articles you might be able to link me. Thanks.",4,7,2013-09-30,EBAY,0.020608525723218918,0.883840799331665,0.09555068612098694
Ebay,"Not paying, fake account?","I had my old iPhone up for sale the other day and it went for a good bit more than I thought it would. Sadly the buyer hasn't paid (almost 3 days) and have had zero communication. After closer inspection of their account I realized the last 6 items in their history were all purchased from the same seller, all iPhone accessories. My theory is that some of these big sellers/re-sellers of phones are making fake accounts, building up their history and buyer score to bid on competitors auctions just to get them out of the way. Driving up the prices out of the range of legit purchasers to make their own auctions look much more attractive and to give completed listings look like their a much healthier market.

Sound like a possibility? Anything more I can do other than just filing a non-payment? Is there a way to report possible fraud or is this not even worth the time?",6,4,2013-09-30,EBAY,0.035180967301130295,0.9149670004844666,0.04985200986266136

I know signature delivery is covered completely for verified addresses and proof of delivery up to a certain amount. But is there a £ value of cover for unverified domestic sales?",2,2,2013-09-30,EBAY,0.03844836726784706,0.9372354745864868,0.024316182360053062

Ebay,Courtesy Refund - I think eBay just did me a solid,"Won an auction for a toy helmet, it arrived with pieces missing. Opened 'not as described' case, explained problem and requested refund. I said I'd return the item at seller's expense because it was the seller's fault.

Seller responded that it wasn't missing anything and no refunds per policy in listing. I replied with photos showing what I received and what I should have received, then escalated case. In the escalation I reiterated that I would return the item at the seller's expense.

After doing some more reading I learned that I'd most likely have to pay the return shipping even though the problem is entirely the seller's. I guess this is the customary procedure in such situations.

eBay closed case in my favor with a comment, ""You have been issued a courtesy refund by eBay"" with no mention of returning the item. I am taking this to mean that the seller keeps my money, eBay is refunding me out of their own pocket, and the return shipping expense has become irrelevant.

Did eBay just do me a solid by eating this one so I wouldn't have to pay return shipping?",9,0,2013-09-30,EBAY,0.11968221515417099,0.8545637726783752,0.025754069909453392
Ebay,Unnecessary changes!,Why did eBay fix what wasn't broken to begin with!? They made the My eBay and selling areas much more complicated with no benefits.
