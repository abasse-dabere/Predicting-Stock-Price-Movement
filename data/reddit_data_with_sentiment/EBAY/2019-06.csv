Ebay,"Had a bad feeling about buyer before sale, sold anyway. Now Buyer requesting refund 10 days after receiving item.","UPDATE:
I appreciated everyone's advice so much! I was pretty anxious. I received my item back and as it turns out she was probably trying to sell it again because she altered the bottle and its label as well as USED THE PRODUCT! I contacted Ebay and they agreed on a 1/2 refund because the buyer took so much time to request the return AND return it plus altering it and using it. I'm pretty happy with the end result and I've decided to give the item to my granddaughter and just call it a wash! 

Thanks all!!!
__________________

I started selling on Ebay because I have pretty bad PTSD and anxiety which makes it pretty hard to ""function"" in a 9-5. I guess I'm writing because I would like reassurance/advice that I handled this exchange properly. I'll get better about it as time goes on but initially I am pretty anxious about all items I sell in general but I digress...

I knew this particular buyer would be an issue, but I stupidly accepted their haggle and shipped the item. I promptly blocked them from future purchases... and what do you know? 10 flippin days after delivery confirmation she messages me claiming the listing was incorrect and the item wasn't as described but, she'll take a 2/3 refund, so she'd be paying practically nothing for a discontinued hard to find item and keep item and be satisfied. What the hell? I already got under bid and believe she's lying anyway. I want my item back! I sent her a message and I guess I'm looking for feedback? 

.....

 Hello! I am sorry there was an error in the listing and that the item seems to be less than the detailed description. Because I do not normally offer refunds, please open an Item Not As Described Case and there will be shipping label created to return the item. Once the item is returned there will be a full refund issued to you. Sorry for the inconvenience and I will be looking for your return in the mail in the coming week.

Ebay,Saw a big jump in sales by bulk changing my prices. Increasing prices.,"https://imgur.com/1i8x04t  
  
The kicker is that I.... increased.... my prices by $5 to about 200 listings, some 50 or so increased by $10, and a few increased by $15. No price decreases. These were ""stale"" listings 8 months old to about 4 months old. Within 24 hours I saw immediate improvement in sales. My listing habits did not change and I listed about 10-15 things daily for the whole 30 month chart. The arrow shows the date that I made all of these changes in the bulk editor.  
  
Anyone else seen this with their store, or is it all pure coincidental?",12,15,2019-06-01,EBAY,0.043313346803188324,0.7826170921325684,0.1740695983171463
Ebay,Confirmed eBay Glitch This Morning Regarding Free Listings,"Hi all!

I woke up today and saw that in addition to my regular allotment of store listings, I was gifted an extra 50 listings this month as a promotional offer. I have some items that I don't generally list except for when I get some freebie listings, but I noticed as I posted them that my store allotment was decreasing, not the promotion, which is usually what decreases first. 

I called eBay and learned that it is a known glitch this morning that some store owners are seeing the 50 free listings given to non-store owners each month, but we are not actually being given them. 

So, before you go and re-post a bunch of ended listings thinking you've got some freebies, double check! If the promotion is good for the whole month, it's probably the glitch. 

Happy June all. Keep on selling!",7,11,2019-06-01,EBAY,0.04240536689758301,0.9254220128059387,0.03217269480228424

Does ebay still remove negs for shade and dark/lightness discrepancy? Since I don't have free returns, eBay will not entertain making this right in my favor even though it is about color shade.
  
If he does INAD, I know I have no choice but to except a free return, but I could at the end of it, report the buyer.

Ebay,How i built a part time 6 figure eBay store,"Quick summary - Had great corporate job that I hated, quit about 7 months ago to do eBay full time. Now bored out of my mind and getting a PT job at Lowes so I have more to do.  We did $110k our first year on eBay (doesn't include Poshmark, Amazon, Mercari, Facebook, or local sales). I work on eBay stuff maybe 3-4 hours a day, go thrifting pretty much daily, &amp; i ship 6 days a week.

80% of my revenue came from purely thrifting, the rest came from random bulk buys I came across. Ive learned tons this year and thought I could help some folks out. Im not coming here to tell you to make sure your listings are perfect, you promote your items &amp; take great photos, theres much more than that to be successful.

**1 - It is your business, treat it like that -**  Do not sell on eBay for ""fun"", thats stupid. This should be your baby, you should look over this like you do your genitals. If you go in with a care free mind set you will not make real money. eBay is not a joke, people make lots of money on there. Im a guy working out of a 1k sq foot house and did six figures my first year hardly trying. I am not special, I didnt go to college, I dont have rich parents. I started my business with a $15 pair of shoes &amp; it changed my life. eBay helped us buy a home, save our dog during an accident, &amp; has provided an amazing amount f freedom from shitty jobs and stupid bosses.

**2 - Inventory control** \- Besides treating this like your baby, there is nothing else more important than this. I dont care about how great you are at taking photos, writing descriptions, or customer service. None of that matters if you cant find the product you just sold. At one point, i looked for an item for over an hour before just canceling the order. You MUST create a storage system that works for you. Doesn't matter if you only have 10 products to sell, start now and stay on top of it. I use the program called Boxstorm, its 100% free and works amazing. Lets you print out barcodes as well ( ill do a whole nother post on this app soon). I now have about 450 products in stock and plan on being near 1000 come 4th quarter, it is impossible to work if you are not organized.

**3 - Keep pushing -** Some weeks suck, some weeks blow my mind, some weeks i find amazing stuff and others i find nothing. You have to keep going, keep feeding the beast. The only way you make money on eBay is by listing &amp; selling, you have to keep snowballing your products until you have so many &amp; the money starts being steady.  After about a inventory of 200 items, I can project roughly what ill make in a week on a regular bases. Ive hated eBay, customers have pissed me off, ive lost money on tons of items, retail sucks no matter what. But the fact that I can wake up to $600 in sales overnight makes it all worth it. The fact that I dont have a stupid manager making me do corporate paperwork for no reason makes it all worth it. The fact that this is mine and im so proud of it, makes it all worth it.

**4 - Do not listen to the old timers -** We all know those guys, they sold on eBay 20 years ago and think they still know what they are talking about. Its not relevant. Thats not what eBay is anymore. Most old timers had eBay because its a legit marketplace now with rules. EVERY single old eBay seller ive met has told me that I am crazy for doing this. Once I tell them we do $10k a month on eBay, they start to shut up. The internet is so so so young, we have no idea where it will be in ten years. We havent scratched the surface of online retail yet. eBay isnt going anywhere. Stop selling stupid ass trinkets that no one wants.

**5 - Cater towards middle class or higher &amp; avoid ""old people stuff"" -** Buy higher end stuff, avoid selling cheap generic products. You do not want to attract lower income people to your store. Im sorry if this sounds rude, but its the truth. They will cause headaches because their money is more valuable to them.  In my opinion the best market is males between 30-45 years old. DO NOT CATER TO OLD FOLKS, again this may sound rude, but the stuff that grandma collected isnt worth anything. Trinkets, plates, figurines, bells, whatever else you find in a glass curio, pretty much all garbage and you'll sit on it for two years before you get an offer for half price. Before someone gets all butt hurt and says all they sell is trinkets, SURE there are some very valuable pieces still, but generally 99% of trinkets are pure trash.

**6 - STUDY STUDY STUDY -**  You need to be able to recognize items &amp; know their rough market value without help. You need to know what a real vintage t shirt looks like, you need to know what a union label looks like, you need to know what brands of 70's stereo receivers sell for the most money, you need  to know what style of sneaker is cool right now. Not all ink toners sell for tons of money, but some sell for hundreds, its your job to know which ones are the gold mine. This is hard &amp; it takes time. If you're a vanilla person that has no interests &amp; thinks Olive Garden is a high end Italian joint, this wont work for you. You need to be creative in this field, sure using sold listings is what i do 75% of the time, but at this point ive sold so much random crap that I know the value of most things I come across without looking it up.

**7 - Learn communication skills -** I did sales in NYC at a suit shop, i learned a ton there, but honestly if people spent 2 hours on Youtube, they could learn many of the same skills. Sales is easy because its just about creating a bond. Literally all that has to be is a common interest in any random thing &amp; the conversation can completely shift. You need to learn the skill of the haggle, you must be confident &amp; not be scared to tell people you are a re seller. Oh and don't be a dick to people. Make it easy for someone to sell items to you, come prepared with cash and a plan, research items before meeting up with them, tell them you're a reseller and if they have anything else you'd love to look at it. If youre a timid person, this may not be for you.

**8 - If you screw up, own up to it -** I send something to someone and I missed a huge flaw on that item somehow.. you know what happens? I refund the person ALL of their money PLUS $5 for wasting their time because I screwed up. Even when I sold an item for ""Parts only"", i overlooked something major and ended up refunding the customer all of his money because its the right thing to do. In 1 year i've earned over 800 positive feedback, customer service is not a joke to me.

**9 - IGNORE DIFFICULT CUSTOMERS -** this is your business!!! Ask me too many questions, make too many special requests, or make my life difficult I ignore you. I quit my job to pursue eBay because I love the freedom, i didn't do it to be a slave to some dumbass for a $15 item. If someone needs to ask more than 1-2 questions about an item, im out. Ill wait for another buyer. People that ask alot of questions always cause more issues. On Facebook marketplace be ruthless, you will deal with so much stupidity there that its not even funny.

**10 - Just try it already -** stop waiting, stop asking questions, stop researching, stop being scared, just act. People online ask so many questions at the wrong time. Get your feet wet &amp; then start asking questions. Dont rely on peoples help all of the time, figure things out yourself. When I had an active Instagram showing my business, I had so many people asking questions like how do you sell on eBay? If thats really your question, then you can frig off.

Ebay,So Paypal Decided in the Buyers Favor - Ongoing Dispute,"Previous Post - https://reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/btdklr/ebay_rules_in_my_favor_but_now_buyer_has_opened_a/


Received an email this morning stating that Paypal has decided in the buyers favor. 

Absurd. 

“We've determined that your buyer should receive a refund, once we have confirmed that the merchandise has been returned to you. The merchandise should be in the same condition as when your buyer received it. “

The item will OBVIOUSLY not be received in the same condition since it was received working by the buyer, and broken 34 days later after delivery, after the buyer admitted to using it flawlessly till then. 

What is my recourse? 

I’m assuming that Paypal wants me to refund the money, receive the item that I KNOW is not in original condition as when it was sold, and open a claim against the buyer? And back and forth again? Jesus fkin christ. 

What happens if I just ignore and quit using paypal? Will they send to collections? I have deleted all banks/accounts in my Paypal Wallet.

Ebay,UPDATE: Buyer went directly to Paypal Case,"Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/bnhwaw/buyer_skipped_ebays_return_system_and_went/

I don't do updates but this was such a bizarre instance I feel the need to. 

The Paypal case closed in the buyers favor and I got an email saying because I didn't respond it closed. I had responded and the email before that even stated that the buyer uploading tracking because I had selected the option to return for a full refund and the case was in full swing.

It turns out the buyer told Paypal I opened a USPS Insurance Claim (which I did, as a backup to his scamming). He told Paypal this after messaging me on eBay saying USPS took the item from him. So I guess the Paypal Rep closed the case using other reasons and the emails didn't make sense.

I called USPS to update my claim and USPS Accounting Services had no record of such a report being filed. They said to call his local post office to verified as the form takes time to file, which I did. We discussed the issue, they said they never pick up items for insurance claim purposes. They agreed to write a letter signed and dated stating they do not and will send it to me a few days later.

I get a call back from USPS a few days later and this postmaster guy was super defensive. He said he would NOT write me a letter, not even an email, even just a statement saying they don't pick up items. Why not? The claim being the reason the Paypal case even closed, I needed proof he had the item

At this point USPS decision was okay for me. I had called Paypal before that phone call  and appealed. Since there was no tracking for the return, the case should have never been closed and I got my money back.

Although, there are a few items that I can pack with me and ship from where I will be, although I wont be able to bring every item I have in stock (only like 2-3 items I plan to bring). Is it possible to put my store on vacation, but have it show that those items will not be delayed with shipping?",3,3,2019-06-03,EBAY,0.6747517585754395,0.2969897985458374,0.028258461505174637

Ebay,Buyer account indefinitely suspended after a SNAD claim...,"I've been a long time buyer and seller on UK eBay, great feedback with no previous issues.

I filed a SNAD claim for an item that came in an empty box. Yes, yes, I know it's a common scam but that doesn't change a genuine situation.

This was a high value purchase, and frankly it feels like eBay banned me so they could avoid a payout.

The case was closed automatically in favour of the seller, and I've had no recourse to provide my own evidence other than the pictures with the original case. I have a reference number from the Police but they're not interested in reopening a case whilst I'm suspended. I can't seem to undo the suspension. This is my first account, no others, so I really am at a loss as to how I'm deemed high risk.

Ebay,What is wrong with people,"Had a guy put in an offer at 10:30 his time, which is 1:30AM my time, and accepted the offer when I woke up. Guy then emails me saying he had a coupon that expired at midnight and I should just cancel the order. I offer him a $5 discount, which I’ve already accepted an $80 offer on an item I had listed for $115. He then tells me I need to take the shipping off, I said no. Then he wants me to move the shipping costs to the sale price of the item so he can get more ebucks, I again say no as the shipping was enough and I didn’t want my invoice to be wrong. He then pays for it, and tells me “your customer service is on the line” “ship it ASAP, so I can decide what kind of review I want to leave.” He had threatened me and repeatedly demanded I find some way to honor the coupon from eBay. I don’t feel I should have to do that as it’s not my coupon. I ended up cancelling the order and telling him that his attitude caused the cancelation of the order. Was I wrong?


Update:

After I cancelled his order I sent him a message saying he was a pissant, this is the response I got. Apparently I didn’t block him properly. 


“Now you see,... its those kind of insults and poor customer service that have left me no choice but to report you to eBay for unprofessional conduct. You are in violation of eBay policies, and judging by your feedback, i see that you have insulted other people here on eBay as well.

Ebay,Should I buy clearance winter clothing and try selling them in winter?,"At Macy’s there’s a lot of high end out of season brand name sweaters, coats, and long sleeves on the clearance racks. Brands include, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger,and much more. Despite being on clearance, the prices still range between 50-300 dollars. While the MSRP is typically more than triple the clearance price. 

Would it be a good idea to buy up these products now?

It seems risky to lay down $300 on one item with an MSRP of $800 and hope that I can sell it for $450 when winter comes.

Ebay,Bug in Promoted Listings Process,"So...  I'm not sure if this has been brought up yet.  But I wanted to make sure to let other sellers know since I've dealt with it a few times, now.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I have roughly 1800 products up.  All are fixed price, have promoted listings and all have best offer.  I have a specific formula I use for pricing so it is all automated, really.  However, it seems some folks have found a loophole to frak with sellers.  I'm not sure if it is targeted or just random.  

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, with a best offer, if someone offers above your asking price it automatically accepts because it is above the minimum.  So I had someone offer over $7000 for a license plate I was selling for $28.  The FVF was around $250.  But the promoted listing fee was over $1000.  Now, don't get me wrong...  If eBay finds a way to get someone to pay over $7000 for a $28 plate, I'm all for giving them $1000.  However, here's where the kicker comes in...

&amp;#x200B;

So, of course, the person doesn't pay.  No response.  I open a Unpaid Item Case.  Finally get the FVF refunded.  Blocked the bidder account.  However, Promoted Listing fees are not refunded automatically.  At least, not that I have seen.  So twice now I've had someone offer some outrageous amount for an item on best offer and then stick me with the Promoted Listing fee.  eBay was pretty cool both times about clearing it.  But if you don't know, you will get stuck with it if you don't watch your numbers.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways...  Good luck and good selling, friends!",6,2,2019-06-08,EBAY,0.029030287638306618,0.932053804397583,0.03891591727733612

Ebay,Is it just me that has terrible luck selling?,"I gave up eBay years ago after some horrible interactions with a buyer. 
I have recently tried using it again to shift old clothes/shoes since I have recently moved and want do downsize.
I feel like every time I try to sell something it goes wrong and it just doesn’t feel worth it to me now. Usually because of the following:

1. Low-ball offers for brand new or decent items, such as a new pair or Dr Martens; repeated harassing messages from the same people when I politely decline their offers and explain why 
2. Regularly, an auction ends for more than I expected just for a buyer to decide not to pay, or even let me know that they’ve changed their minds.
3. I finally sell something after taking great care to describe and photograph it from every angle, being sure to be super specific as I’ve been burned before... just for the buyer to find something incredibly minuscule (such as a tiny scratch I hadn’t noticed on a pair of otherwise immaculate boots) and suddenly they become quite threatening and rude for no good reason, and exaggerating the extent of the problem; OR someone deliberately damaging an item in an attempt to get a refund when I had refused a return just because something didn’t fit. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else has given up casual selling due to frustration/feeling powerless when someone decides to make things difficult? All in all, I feel it would be better for my mental health to just give stuff away to charity and cut my losses, but it’s a real shame as I could use the money and the stuff I’m trying to sell is mostly new and has value.",19,10,2019-06-09,EBAY,0.15085160732269287,0.8223331570625305,0.026815282180905342

Ebay,Received a counterfeit item and sellers return address is fake,"I purchased an American Silver Eagle bullion coin on eBay a couple weeks ago but when it arrived I noticed it looked off and of course when I stuck the magnet to it, that thing was very obviously not silver. 

So I quickly asked the seller for my money back but now he’s sent me a fake address all the way in Morocco. 

So here lies the dilemma;

1. If I ship it back, he wouldn’t receive it: and if I remember correctly, I don’t get my money back until the seller receives his item again. 

2. It would most likely cost the same amount to ship as it’s worth in the first place. 

3. This is technically counterfeit currency. Keeping it would be illegal and shipping it is even worse if customs gets to it.

Ebay,Im a new seller and need help with a return request from a wacko buyer,"I sold a hat, shipped it off, all good.

They originally stated they received a blues hat, and i clarified that is the style of the hat (and sent a picture to the manufactures website that uses that as the style code) and that the pictures and the description state the color of the hat is black. Some back and forth ensues and the buyer is extremely difficult to understand and types very questionably for a US buyer... it seems that their story changes and they’re not claiming i “falsely advertised” a black hat as a blue hat,. They want me to foot the return shipping. My listing was 100% accurate. They’re now claiming my pictures show a blue hat... Moments ago the buyer opened a return and appears to have added a tracking number from yesterday, and has not dropped it off yet... I have returns on, with buyer paying return shipping. I was honestly prepared to take the loss on shipping (it’s not much $, but I’m a student and a very small seller with a pretty small budget to sell with right at the moment, so every $ counts when possible, but wanted to protect my 100% feedback on an 8 year old account). Did the buyer do me a favor by opening a return? If they send the hat back they will be charged for shipping correct? And if they do not send the item in time, do they still have the options to return/open a case again me, though I am 100% in the right here? I’ve attached the messages, pictures, and return screenshot. This is the first time anything like this has happened, so I’m lost as to how to proceed. Any help here would be great. Thank you all!

Ebay,Selling Everything (just about),"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted some advise on selling just about everything I own. I am not doing it for a minimalism goal, it's actually to pay medical bills from my 14 month old son (yay, USA healthcare!). I have posted some of the bigger ticket items that are either 'vintage' (Atari/NES), tools and electronics (Laptops, tablets, etc.). 

Any advise on how I can sell those little miscellaneous things? Is it better to bundle or leave individually for items like thumb drives, non-luxury jewelry (watches, cuff-links, etc.), books, every-day life collections... I'm going so far as to sell pens, pencils and pads if I have to - if I get 5 cents for them, my wife and I are 5 cents closer to paying off medical bills.

Has anyone had any success mass-dumping their lives on Ebay? I created a separate account for everything regarding this purge. Ebay called me directly originally as a fraud check (as I already had an Ebay account.) They gave me the all clear and even got rid of the original 10 item limit for new accounts and provided me with the 500 my usual account has, so I have some leeway when it comes to listing as much as possible.",2,5,2019-06-09,EBAY,0.0237527247518301,0.9322826266288757,0.04396464675664902

Ebay,eBay made me pay for items twice and now are not taking responsibility for it.,"Made a reddit account just to share this ridiculous story. If anyone knows what I should do about this, please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

I won a couple of bids yesterday (eBay UK) and went through the checkout process with 9 items at the same time. I logged in to my PayPal account, paid via PayPal and everything, a total of about £70. Payment was taken from my PayPal account but after an hour or so I realised that on eBay the items were still marked as 'unpaid'.

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted eBay Live Chat over this issue and I was advised that I should pay for the same items again, a second time, and that I would be automatically refunded for the first lot of payments within 24 hours. It seemed like rubbish, but I was reassured continuously by the CS agent that it would be OK.

&amp;#x200B;

So I paid again. Now - 24 hours later, as expected there is no automatic refund.

&amp;#x200B;

I contact eBay who tell me that it is a PayPal problem and contact them to dispute the duplicate payments.

&amp;#x200B;

I contact PayPal and they tell me it is an eBay problem and I cannot dispute duplicate payments as there is no option for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I contact eBay again, and this time they tell me to message the sellers and ask politely for a refund on the first lot of purchases... bloody ridiculous.

In the end, after complaining for a while, eBay tell me to ask the sellers for a refund first, and if my requests are ignored I should open a dispute after a week for not receiving the item, as their logic is that two lots of payments suggest a quantity of two items, and as I will only receive a quantity of one, PayPal should rule that case in my favor.

&amp;#x200B;

Well... time will tell how successful that will go.

Ebay,"Buyer doesn't bid, sends his email and asks me to send a Paypal invoice, what do I do?","Hi, 

I put up an item for auction on ebay a couple of days ago. There are no bids yet. Today someone messaged me and offered to buy my item if I send a Paypal invoice to his email address. He made a great offer too, 1.5x the amount of the starting bid. He has been a member for two decades and has good ratings. My question is, isn't sending your email address to someone and asking for a paypal invoice in violation of ebay's rules? It seems to me that dealing with the buyer directly through paypal would sidestep ebay.  That would also mean that I lose the protective function of Ebay as a middleman.

I'm thinking of setting up a Buy it now price with his offer and asking him to click on that. Any advice?",13,4,2019-06-11,EBAY,0.03017127886414528,0.9319406151771545,0.0378880649805069

Recently bought a camera off of eBay for $400ish. The description the seller provided was not accurate so I contacted him in regards to a return and notified eBay. He refused to help.

eBay then stepped in and ruled in my favor. I sent the return to the seller and he denied delivery when it arrived. I contacted eBay and they let me know that they were closing the case and processing the refund to my PayPal.

eBay told me I’m under no obligation now to return the camera to him unless he’s paying for shipping. They said to give it a week and after that I can do what I want.

Ebay,So Many Scammy Sellers Lately,"I've encountered a bunch of sellers of vintage electronics and computer parts who deliberately misrepresent the condition of their items. Scratches, dents, and dirt obscured by intentionally bad pictures, corrosion and functional issues not mentioned in the description, you name it.

One guy sold me a ""brand new, never opened or used"" sound card. When I got it, it was just the card, no anti-static packaging, just thrown into the box, thick layer of dust all over, and most of the accessories missing.  There were cables from an ATI graphics card in the box for some reason, too. Clearly a pull from his old computer that got put back in the box and shoved in a closet along with his other junk.

They list these things as ""like new,"" ""mint"", ""never used"" and ""open box."" What do they exactly think will happen once the buyer gets the item and realizes it's crap? Nobody is stupid enough to simply keep an item that's much worse than described. And when you open a return, many of them get irate, which to me is 100% proof they knew what they were doing and hate getting called out on it.

What I hate the most, though, is when I leave a neutral/negative and they manage to sweet-talk a naive eBay CS rep into removing it. I always leave factually accurate feedback that mirrors what I write in the return case, no profanities, contact info, or other policy violations.

Ebay,eBay sellers fed up with dishonest buyers,"I have been selling on eBay (Australia) for about 8 years now, the items I sell are relatively cheap ranging anywhere from $6 - $85 and most items are sent in large envelopes which in Australia are generally untracked. For the more expensive items, although not bulky I would spend considerably more for postage ($6-12 as opposed to $2) just so I could track the item.

What I found after about a year of selling was that the I was receiving at least 5% of items not received for the untracked items and virtually 0% for the tracked items. I thought surely not this much mail simply goes missing and was suspecting that buyers were being dishonest but since the items were untracked I had no real way of knowing. To combat this problem and to remain cost effective I thought I would be creative and I ordered a custom stamp, basically a fake barcode and fake tracking number I could stamp on my envelopes, the postman would know right away that it wasn't scan-able but the average person might be a bit perplexed. Well it was a huge success and virtually overnight the rate of untracked items reported as missing was less than 1%.

Many years have passed now but I am facing a new set of problems with eBay, I have been putting tracking labels on a lot of my items (real labels) but I do not upload tracking info to eBay since the courier collects them without scanning them in and I get slugged with late shipping penalty if I upload them, but I am still getting the odd person claim to have not receive their item, demanding a refund or more stock, I then upload the tracing number I keep on a database and tell them the item was delivered and I never hear from them again, OR they get so angry even after I assure them I would be happy to enquire where it is although it says delivered (perhaps because I caught them out) that they continue to leave negative feedback which eBay refuse to remove.

I think this kind of dishonest practice must be rife through eBay, the system is flawed and there is no way of identifying these buyers. Ideally I would bar people from purchasing from me who have a history of lodging item not received requests or have history of leaving frequent negative feedback. It is so frustrating that there is no way for sellers to oust bad buyers and eBay always upholds the stance of the buyer. 

I am strongly considering developing a database for sellers to report ebay buyers who have lodged numerous item not received, not that it will fix anything but perhaps it will eventually highlight to eBay that there is a problem here that needs to be fixed. I feel at ransom to eBay and the buyer and i'm at breaking point.

Ebay,Bizarre Buyer Messages?,"Copied from my post in the ebay community page because answers tend to be pretty slow there

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all, 

I'm selling something on my store right now and got two very odd messages and was hoping to see if anyone else had experienced something like this before. 

I received this one first from the potential buyer:

""I would like to purchase your new item of ""\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*"". However, the date of the item states that it ends on July 13. The current date is July 14th, 2019. Can you change the date if the item is still yet to be sold and guarantee that the item will be sold to me because I have provided you with this information? Please send me the time of which you will change the date to this ebay account so that I may purchase this product. Thank you.""

I thought it was a simple mix up, thanked them for contacting me and politely told them that it was June 14th, not July. They then respond with this message, 

""The thing is that I tried to input my credit card information to buy the product. However, it would not work and it said to contact the buyer. Can you please help me out? Thank you.""

My gut reaction is that this is an attempt to try and circumvent paying through ebay and trying to scam me, but thought it'd be worth it to make sure no one else had had a buyer tell them something like this before. This is a buyer with no seller history, and 8 positive buyer feedback and has been a member for 2 years as of right now.

Unless I hear otherwise I'm going to go with my gut reaction and cut communication with the buyer and block them just to be on the safe side.

Ebay,🔋Does Lithium batteries containing devices need special shipment treatment?🔋,"I won a bid about a used psp device for 50 pounds from the UK, i agreed with the seller  to ship using the royal mail international tracked which would cost me 20 pounds, but after the seller checked he told me that lithium battery containing devices  need special shipping procedure and would cost 50 pounds for shipping (now i am paying as much as the device in shipping) and they might not even be willing to ship it.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you my country has no strict regulation on lithium. ( i bought before a psp battery from Germany no issues for 5-7 euro shipping)

I also bought a PsP from japan standard shipping free (mind you i am sure the shipping price is included but i doubt it would be that much) still en route.

My question here, is the UK the only one with that much of a strict regulation on shipping lithium battery ?( what about the rest of Europe if someone knows) and would the shipping really cost that much? If that's true might as well pay extra and buy it from somewhere else other than Europe.

Ebay,In case of fraud always DO CALL THE SHIPPING COMPANY!,"Today I was a target for a scam. I got a weird message about changing the shipping address:

""Hello !!!   


I just bought \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from you, hope all looks great with product 📷 and will be gr8 b.day gift for my gf))) here is hers shipping address you have to send it: ""

So obviously the user didn't buy anything. They just found my sold listing and wanted to scam me. 

I immediately called the address ""113 BRIGHTON 11th street"" in Brooklyn, and at first I couldn't find the business. But after several calls to neighboring companies with same street address I found out that its a shipping company GEO AMANATI (it basically works as a PO box for international clients in the country of Georgia). I was able to get the shipping company owner's number and talked to them. He explained that scammers often use their address to ship goods to Georgia. He was able to find this scammer's PO Box ( I provided the info) and blocked him. There were already 10 packages in his PO BOX. I guess because of my call the scammer is no longer getting them LOL. Because the owner of the company will return them back to sellers. The owner also told me how many troubles he get into because of the scammers. The local post office doesnt want to deliver to Geo amanati, the UPS doesnt want to deliver, there are police reports filed against them, the business gets bad reputation. The owner said they now implemented a policy that their clients need to show bank statements that they paid for the item before he ships it to them in Georgia (he used to ask for invoices but they now use the fake ones, so asking for invoices doenst help any more). The owner assured me it's super important to notify shipping companies because anytime a Georgian citizen uses their services, they sign a contract, that in fraud cases, the package will be withheld even if it's already on the way to Georgia (remember it takes 30 days to deliver USA-Georgia, so you have plenty of time to stop the package).

All in all, if you ever encounter the scammer, please DO CALL THE SHIPPING COMPANY! Your call may help the other US sellers to get their products back.",7,69,2019-06-16,EBAY,0.07567079365253448,0.8995381593704224,0.024791020900011063
Ebay,UPDATE: No Shoe Box Guy Wants a Return!,"Posted last week about a buyer who has been harassing me that ""he didn't say there was no box"" on a sale of pre-owned basketball shoes. He threatened a negative review, then eventually left one saying ""Unprofessional and will not respond, and INAD"" after I stopped replying on the 6th message of ""You are a joke"".

Called eBay and they immediately removed the neg feedback since it was obvious the listing made no mention of any box and assuming there was one was his fault. They also saw how harassing he was being. They told me to block him.

Now he wants a return.

The listing was marked as no returns. He's obviously making the claim of INAD, which is totally false and I'm assuming eBay will agree (since they agreed to remove the feedback with the same claim.)

How do I handle this? If eBay denies his return, will he just go upstream to PayPal? Should I be considering offering him some money?

I thought I could log out and log back in to fix the issue (it doesn't make sense now, but it did at the time), but I got a message that I couldn't log back in again since I'd been suspended.

I took to Google again, but the link I found to contact someone required me to login; which of course I couldn't do.

Whole thing was around $40.

Seller didnt reply to the case I opened, just messaged me directly. I dont intend on leaving any bad feedback since I do not think the seller sold me used knives on purpose or anything. If they were new and put in storage until I bought them they likely just grabbed it and put it in a box without noticing the blades became discolored and the handles got tiny cracks (humidity? knives shipped from New Jersey) and seller just didnt catch it. I even said as much in the case. Either way they did not match description or pics. 

The message they sent didnt seem hostile or anything but they seem upset over the case as any seller would but remain neutral in tone (if you can even have tone in typed messages)

Ebay,Bought a replacement laptop screen all for nothing. What's my best option?,"TLDR: Don't need an item anymore, and I dealt with returning another item just a week ago. What do?

I am a freaking idiot.

Earlier this month I bought a replacement laptop screen hoping it would fix display issues. It wound up with its own issues. I chalked it up to it being incompatible/defective and had it returned. I then bought another screen for slightly cheaper after double checking compatibility.

It wound up having the same symptoms as the original.

I then decided to plug both the monitors into an identical laptop, and it turns out both work perfectly fine.

Now, for this item, returns are free, but it feels like a dick move for the seller to be burdened with the return shipping and processing it because of my stupidity. Plus, if [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/a82985/will_ebay_warn_me_if_i_return_too_many_items/) is anything to go by, any additional returns so soon may come across as suspicious. Like, ""ban my account without warning"" suspicious. Especially since I haven't bought that many items to begin with.

To be clear, the replacement screen works just fine. I just found out the hard way I didn't really need it.

So I'm not sure whether to

1. Make the return and risk the consequences
2. Sell the screen at a lower price (though technically it was barely any more used than it was to begin with)
3. ...something else?",25,1,2019-06-16,EBAY,0.0688619315624237,0.874340295791626,0.05679777264595032

They went to USPS and the clerk did a metaphorical, maybe literal spit take. They measured, weight and requoted at over $100 dollars. Buyer does spit take out of another bodily orfice.

I have read that if you ship to an address that is not associated with the PayPal account, you forfeit your protection as a seller.  I am concerned that despite seeming like a nice guy, he is trying the old “the package didn’t arrive I want my money back” scam.

Ebay,Stop Buyer Setting Up New Account To Buy From You,"I've got a buyer who deals in one brand of item and whenever I list items of that brand he sometimes buys it. He has never left negative feedback but about every second transaction results in a return. And it's not ever a strait forward return as he likes pushing goal posts. He is the most annoying person I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. He sometimes messages me to complain about things he is not even buying or tells me how to run my business. 

Dealing with him to get sales from the occasional item that does not get returned is not worth it because he is a competitor and for what it does to my blood pressure.

When he buys something I block that user ID and he sets up new accounts so he can buy from me. I currently have seven of these accounts blocked with their email address and his PayPay email address blocked.

How do I set things up so he can never buy from me again?

Ebay,"Sold DVD sets to same buyer using two different accounts, now asking for return on both due to ""damage"" which is just minor shelfwear to the slipcover.","I had a listing up for a brand new DVD set with offers and had a few copies available. I had two offers that came in at different amounts from two different buyers. They came from the same zip code. I accepted both offers and upon receiving payment, I see that it is to the same address. 

The buyer leaves a note asking if I can package it up good so it won't be damaged during shipping. This set is double shrinkwrapped. One around the DVD case, and then another around the slipcover. In my listing photos you can see the slipcover has shelfwear.

I put it between cardboard and into a padded mailer, shipped it out and thought nothing else of it. The same buyer made an offer on another one of the sets. I accepted and shipped it out yesterday. The original two that he ordered were delivered later on yesterday. After delivery, this buyer also sent an offer from the second account for another set that I had listed and I accepted. Five minutes later he requested that I cancel the order. So I did.

 I then receive a notification of a return request and within 15 minutes he had opened a return request from both accounts for ""arrived damaged"". He stated ""slipcover damaged and crushed"" and included photos which showed the minor shelfwear that was in my listing photos. He hasn't opened the items either as they are still shrink-wrapped in the photos he sent. And when I say minor shelfwear, I mean like a quarter of an inch crease and slight blunted corners. I've looked at the photos and compared it to the set I still have and his photos are zoomed in so much. Otherwise, the case and discs are undamaged. I imagine he will be opening a return request on the third set when it is delivered.

This buyer sells movies on one of the accounts and now has these two brand new sets listed for sale that went up yesterday after the two were delivered. He only used stock photos as well. He has several hundred positive feedback, but I can't help but feel there is some sort of scam going on here. How can he request a return on two items that he just listed for sale? They are also listed at the same price I sold them to him for. These aren't easy to come by brand new and I sold each for about $40.

How do I respond to this?

 I called ebay for support as well, but they said they can't escalate until after time is up for me to take action.

I messaged them back on the return request and said it wasn't damage, was just normal shelfwear. Should I accept the return? Or wait for a reply? Or wait it out and contact ebay?

Ebay,Is free vs charged shipping ONLY about buyer psychology?,"My point in asking is not to debate whether offering Free Shipping attracts more buyers, but more about other benefits or drawbacks of building shipping charges into the total price vs charging separately.

\-possibly more exposure via Fast and Free

\-chance to pocket a little more (or pay more) when shipping greater distances

\-chance to avoid discounting shipping when selling multiple items to a single buyer

I've heard conflicting information about how this affects returns - does Free Shipping matter if I do or do not choose to accept returns?

But I had read the ebay money back policy and figured its hard to NOT get a refund on ebay as a buyer, right?

Wrong apparently. The seller sent a small bubble mailer instead of laptops and I had the post office ""refuse"" the package,. I.e., they sent it straight back at no cost to me. Post office worker said it would be the best way to prove I didn't have it etc. And that made sense to me.

Now, eBay won't refund me because apparently refusing packages is against their refund policy which makes zero sense to me. The lady at eBay tried to argue and got mad at me when I explained MY frustration lol.

So now I have opened a case with PayPal and let's hope it goes smoother on their end.

Ebay also said I waited too long to open a case (longer than 30 days from original delivery) blah blah but it wouldn't let me open a case until the shipping period ended (it was economy mail from Taiwan to US).

Any tips for avoiding other scams in the future? Has anyone had a similar ebay experience? I know they treat sellers like crap but I thought they'd treat me well, having bought so much stuff from ebay over the years with a 100% positive feedback score :p",51,19,2019-06-19,EBAY,0.04174107313156128,0.91539466381073,0.042864277958869934
Ebay,Buyer bought an item from me and told me to ship it tomorrow?,"I have a 4 day handling time and no way to get to the post office tomorrow lol.

Ebay,"Is It Wrong To Request A Refund If The ""Shipped By xxx"" Date has passed?","If a seller says they will ship your item out within 2 business days and they don't, is it wrong to request a refund? 

My last 2 orders (not including this one) were shipped out extremely late. One of them waant shipped for 11 days. Frankly, I am sick of lazy sellers who decide that it's okay to take their time on shipping after we paid. Imo that's irresponsible and bad selling. 

I know that I always shipped out by my promise date, and if there was a reason I couldn't then I always sent the buyer a message explaining why. And they almost always were okay with that. I would be too if someone sent me a message. At least then I would know I wasn't getting ripped off. 

Ebay has become a haven for bad sellers. And no, I am not going to stop ordering from ebay because there are great hard working sellers out there who deserve my business. 

This current order was supposed to be shipped out by today. It hasn't been. I also sent a polite message to the seller and haven't gotten a response yet. He/she has 100% feedback, which was why I chose to order from them. 

Should I wait 1 more day or should I opt for a refund? I realize it's up to me, but I am a nice person and wouldn't mind waiting a bit if I got a response. 

Thanks for any and all advice.",15,13,2019-06-19,EBAY,0.10043670982122421,0.846522867679596,0.05304044485092163

Ebay,Account suspended indefinitely after trying to use for first time in years,"I'm so confused right now and not sure what to do, here's the situation:

I have used Ebay in the past but not for years so my account had been deleted from inactivity. Today I went to buy something and was logged into Gmail and logged into Ebay and I saw what looked like an automatically created account with letters of my first name, last name, and some numbers. Doing this also caused me to receive an email from Ebay titled ""&lt;Name&gt; thank you for joining eBay!"", so I believe the account was created merely by visiting Ebay while logged into Gmail. However, when I tried to buy an item, I got a message saying ""You've reached a temporary buying restriction."" I had tried to buy two of the item, so I changed the quantity to one and tried again but got the same message.

I figured something must be bugged with the Ebay account, so I registered a new account, this time with a non-gmail email I've used in the past for my old deleted account. Using the same credit card, address, and phone number as before, I was able to buy the item just fine. Then, 15 minutes later, I got a message on the gmail account saying that I was indefinitely suspended from eBay including all other accounts. My non-gmail account still works for the time being though.

I do use a VPN sometimes and I thought that might be the problem, but I've had it off all day. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas?

Ebay,"Partial-Seeking Buyer just ran the playbook on me, to the letter...","I swear, this one had the 'guide to trying for a partial' playbook in front of them.

* Item was bought &amp; paid. Shipped it out within an hour or so.
* That evening, 30 minutes AFTER it was marked as received by USPS, got a note from buyer: ""I just found out I can buy this brand new from OEM for only 20% more than I paid you, please cancel."" (Total BS - item is 100% not available new and hasn't been for 30 YEARS).
* I responded that I can't cancel as it's already in the shipper's hands. Suggested they file for a free return once it arrives - suggested they not even open the box in that case. Assured them they'll get a prompt refund.
* Radio silence...
* Flash forward a couple days: Item tracking shows delivered and within 30 minutes of that, a ranting message about how it's cracked, I didn't disclose that, I took pictures to hide the cracks (despite 12 photos of all six sides of the item) I'm a scammer and liar and they're 'contacting eBay' ""unless you do something about this"".
* I responded that we have and honor a 30-day no-hassle return policy. Just file for a return on eBay as ""arrived damaged"" for a prompt and full refund. I even mention 'you won't have to pay return shipping'.
* Next note in &lt;1 minute. How I'm a liar, doesn't believe a word I say, SCAMMER! LIAR!  because says item was very securely packed and no damage to the package. ""So you shipped it with cracks. Even Raymond \[sic\] Charles could have seen these cracks in the item"" (yet you couldn't in the photos, I guess) and ""I need to use this item at an event this weekend so no time to get another, even though I could buy it new for 10% LESS than I paid you, and what are you going to do for me about it?????""
* I said ""Why would I knowingly ship a damaged item AND have a 30-day any-reason free returns policy? That makes no sense. Simply file for a return and you'll get a total refund.""
* Next note. ""Never mind, my friend said he can repair the cracks so I can use it. Cheers.""

Note how carefully they never actually ask for a partial. Note how they 'prime the pump' by asking to cancel as soon as they know I can't. Note how they are very careful to do nothing close to feedback extortion...

And yes, I'm 100,000% sure the item was not cracked when I shipped it (but true it was very well-packed).

In any case, I recieved a negative feedback without any communication from the buyer. 

After seeing this I messaged the buyer explaining that I accept returns and am more then happy to accept the item back and asked them to change their feedback. 

The buyer proceeded with their return but would not change their feedback.

I asked the buyer for tracking information which the buyer did not have.

Ebay,Overseas Seller threatening Legal action after shipping an item and cancelling the transaction,"tl;dr I placed a bid for a listing on ebay containing two art prints from an international seller and won. The seller shipped the items prior to disclosing the high shipping price. I reexamined the items prior to knowing they were shipped and noticed that one of the items seemed to have been modified. I asked the seller about that, and the seller cancelled the transaction and threatened legal action. 

This is the bulk of the relevant details: 
I purchased two art prints from an international seller. The bid won (there were no other bids). ebay did not list any shipping costs, so I didn't know the total, and I expected that if the seller had an issue shipping to the US, that would have been communicated to me. I won the bid, and the seller sent this message: 

""I just saw that you live in the United States. The truth is that until last week I offered shipping to everyone, but when selling a pack of very large framed posters and seeing that the shipping was higher I made the change and now I only offer sales to Europe. These two posters to be in a smaller package and as it almost does not weigh the price surely is not as high as in other cases. The package is ready for shipment. Tomorrow I can take it to the post office and tell me how much it would cost to send it to New York. And if you are interested there would be no problem in sending it to America. Does it seem good to you in this way?""

I misinterpreted the language here, and think this was a result of the seller using a web translator. ""These two posters to be in a smaller package"" to me meant they were not in large frames. However, the following day, the seller then upped the shipping to over $50, which was much, much higher than I was willing to pay. 

I asked if the seller could remove the prints from the frames, as they were cheap plastic frames from amazon and not professional/permanent frames. Removing prints from frames and shipping in a tube is not uncommon, as it is less expensive, and the art can be confirmed to be authentic. From previous orders, I know that art prints can be shipped in tubes from EU at around $15 US. Seeing the higher price, and hesitant to proceed with the purchase at the increased price, I looked over the listing to decide how to proceed. In reexamining, I noticed that one of the prints appeared to have been altered, with the band name on the art painted over. This wasn't immediately noticeable as a) the print was in a frame, and b) there are two variations of this print – one has a band name printed on it, the other does not. I had previously assumed it was the version without. I looked up both official versions by the artist, and found that the dimensions were several inches shorter for the version of the piece that did not have the band name. The dimensions in the listing did not match this shorter version without the band. I then reviewed the seller’s other items, and found other expensive band prints (unaltered value of ~$200) that were sold with the band names painted over. Thus it is my suspicion that the seller intentionally altered the print (probably didn't care for the band), and sold it without disclosing the damage.

Unfortunately, seller then informed me that the items were already shipped - this was done before the shipping cost of over $50 US was disclosed to me and agreed upon. I was not happy, and asked the seller about the potential alterations to the prints. The listing had stated that the prints were purchased, but the seller then changed the story from having purchased the print to having been given the print, and said that it ‘does not appear modified’, and it looks ‘looks stunning in person’. Feeling suspicious at this point, I interpreted this as the seller purposefully not actually answering the question, so as to not be caught in a lie by saying 'no, I did not modify the prints'. If they were modified well, they very well may not appear to be modified, when they actually were.  

I told the seller I was uncomfortable, but would be happy to pay once the items arrived, if there was no undisclosed modifications. The seller immediately cancelled the transaction and said 

""Okay, this ends here, the order is canceled. You never paid and I do not want you to pay, so you've never bought any item from my store. You do not pay for the order, but it is very important that you do not accept it when it arrives, if you accept it and open it, I will have to initiate legal actions with a lawyer to demand full payment of the order. So in the shipment tracking can not appear delivered. Please, confirm that you will not accept the package, so it will be returned as it is. And we will avoid having to put lawyers in the middle of this problem.""

My response: 

""It's unfortunate that this is the way this had to end. I was hoping you would have confirmed that the piece was, in fact, not modified, and that we could continue this transaction to completion.

Important question: did you require signature confirmation for delivery? If you did not, I cannot guarantee that the post office will not deliver it, especially while I am not at home. If this happens, it is not my fault that the delivery was completed, thus nothing for which I am legally responsible.

Keep in mind that the tracking number I have is not sourced from an American company, so my suggestion to you is that you contact Correos and have the shipment cancelled or returned. Assuming that is not possible at this juncture, if the tracking history does end up displaying a US carrier - UPS, USPS, FedEx, etc, I suggest you contact that carrier to determine if such an action is possible.

I'm making these suggestions to you because I am trying to help you fix the mess you caused by 1) not being fully transparent as to the details of the items in the posting and 2) shipping an item before the shipping price was agreed upon and accepted by the buyer. Because these errors are not my own, if the package is ultimately delivered here, I will not be held legally responsible if an item was shipped to me before I was even told the cost of shipping. If you are unable to reach the carrier, feel free to reach out, and I can try to call or stop by in person before the delivery is completed.

I hope this can be resolved before you decide to consult a lawyer, as involving an international lawyer would be much greater an expense to you than the Euros you've spent thus far.

Again, feel free to contact me if I can be of assistance preventing this package from being delivered.""  

I've yet to receive a response, and the package is marked as delivered to my apartment building (I'm currently away).  I assume the cancellation absolves me of any responsibility to pay, and as far as I’m concerned/aware, this is the seller’s fault. Thus, I’m not planning on sending this back on my dime.  I also don't want to open the package, as that could potentially exacerbate the situation.  

If the seller refuses to pay for a return shipment, am I potentially in any hot water?

Ebay,"VERO is BS. Company lost lawsuit, Retaliating with VERO","So the Vero program is complete crap and totally abused. EBay only makes up about 10% of our business, and we are are a ""small"" business. I just hired my 2nd employee last month. Our business model is we buy excess product for pennies on the dollar from various manufacturers  and resell for 60-80% of market. 

Recently we procured product at a FedEx lost and salvaged freight auction which we tried reselling back to the manufacturer which we've done a great many of times with no issue (we generally get 50% market rate selling back to the manufacturer if it's less than 2yrs old). But this company decided to sue us, stating we didn't legitimately own the product, and they made the mistake of telling all of their partners not to do business with us because we were selling stolen product, for that lie we were awarded $150,000 in a tort claim. 

To cut a long story short one month later we have now received a Vero request taking down all of our listings for products made by this multi-national company ( about 10% of our listings). Talk about insanity! We have purchase orders, documentation, etc, this is legitimate product! According to the first sale doctrine we have a legitimate right to sell this stuff. I guess they want to lose another $150,000, maybe more if I could prove this is retaliation for losing the lawsuit. Crossing my fingers.

All in all, the Vero program is complete crap! Big companies abuse legitimate sellers. I agree vero is needed against seller selling counterfeits but its being used as a bludgeon against legitimate sellers.

Lo and behond, they find the package a few hours later and it's delivered the next day. Case closed.

But wait, what's this? I check my email and I got an email about the case from [USPS.gov](https://USPS.gov) and this is what they said.

 

&gt;Our records indicate that this item was delivered as addressed on 06/20/2019 in MIAMI, FL 33126 to the freight forwarder contracted by the recipient. EPS 8260 N.W. 14TH  ST 305-591-2900. The delivered scan you see in the system only  indicates we have delivered the item to the freight forwarder. Once we  deliver to them, our responsibility ends and the freight forwarder takes  care of exporting the item to the foreign country where the intended  recipient resides. Delivery to the end recipient can take anywhere from a  few days to a few weeks after we deliver it to the freight forwarder.  If the recipient is claiming that they have not yet received this item,  they should contact the freight forwarder directly.

&gt;**This  shipper receives a lot of packages and has a unique zip code 33191 that  we gave them so we can process their packages more efficiently. The  physical zip code is 33126, for this freight forwarder, which is where  their packages are received.**

Ebay,Have an interesting issue. Ebay closed in sellers favor but seller doesnt exist and ino item delivered.,"So I ordered a radio from China and after a couple weeks the tracking updated that it landed here in the USA. Next day it was in my city. That was 28 days ago. Tracking never updated until I opened my case a few days ago. It says that there was an issue with the delivery and in the details it says ""return to sender due to insufficient address""

So the package was on its way back to china.

So I open the case and says in a few days Ebay will step in but in the mean time contact the seller to work things out. Problem is, the seller doesnt exist anymore. There is no account, hes gone. It wont let me message him at all. So I put all this info in the case details and wait for ebay to step in. They do, and determine that an attempt was made to deliver the package and closed in the sellers favor, no refund.

I use the same PO Box for everything, including that radio order which I had bought other items at the same time including some storage labels from china. It all came fine, previous orders came fine from china and elsewhere, and orders since the radio purchase are also all fine. I asked the employees and nothing was brought to them that they had to decline or turn away so I dont know how Ebay things there was an attempt to deliver. It wasnt my home where I was away and couldnt answer the door. Things are never sent to my home due to porch thefts.

So what do I do now? What if I lose the appeal? What if I do eventually one day get the item and its damaged or a counterfeit? Do another appeal? Do they even allow that? Why would they close the case in the first place? 

What are my options?

Ebay,Hi. Not all buyers are evil!,"After reading this page for merely 2 weeks, i started to feel really bad for sellers tho I am a buyer exclusively since ebay went down Meg Whitman's rabbit hole.

But why did I join? Bc I have a serious $599 INR problem. Not received and seller has sent me no less than 40 nasty messages ina  5 day period. I have had to take my dog's fireworks xanax to deal and it is almost the 4th of july!

  After waiting a week to file an INR, I thought I had to respond to every message in the resolution ctr. In 24 hrs I responded to no fewer to 20 insane messages: all day, all night. I called ebay finally and they said, ignore her; u don't have to reply!

I must say it delighted me to no end to not allow this lunatic to rage at me simply by NOT replying in the resolution ctr. Poetic justice, man. Lol she's probably in a straight jacket not having me to rage at! YAY!!

Anyways, given this situation, I feel terrible for what you sellers go through! Ridiculous!  And bc I did buy a fun $29 item in the midst of this INR problem, and that tiny order was FANTASTIC, I sent this message to the seller of the $29 item.

Maybe awesome  sellers and buyer should create a coop outside the dastardly ebay. Preferred buyers and sellers? Tho in my quandary, THANK GOD  I will get me $600 back. 

My message to the seller of my $29 Ebay TREASURE follows:

Hey, just want to say sorry for all the scammer/deadbeat buyers out there. 20 yrs with ebay - not one problem. Bought a camper once and picked up from georgia! Saw the Confirmation that i received my first aid kit and realized, man, you have to confirm 1000x to avoid an inr! On the flipside, i really didn't receive an item and the seller has been torturing me for 11 days. I found a buyer on her island of Manhattan within 24 hrs of sale! She relisted and sold to him. No small feat! She is trying to keep my money after selling to that buyer. Double the money! Anyways, my heart goes out to you sellers. Appreciate you! But sometimes the seller has to refund as INR. But want to confirm: ITEM RECD, LOVE IT, BETTER THAN DESCRIBED. btw, i have the straps. Do u need them back for anothet aid kit? Will post to u asap if needed.

What happens if a buyer does opt to buy multiples of this item and chooses First Class Mail but the weight ends up being more than 1LB?

 I worry about not being able to implement this a little better to ensure buyers have the best shipping options but at the same time making sure they don't underpay when I have to ship it via another service that accommodates the additional weight of the item.

Ebay,eBay heavily discounting dimensional shipping?,"I've dealt with dimension pricing for large, light items before, but this is a first. 

I shipped a package over a cubic foot and expected a 20 plus dollar shipping charge. As you can see in the picture, eBay lowered the price by a whopping 70% and only charged the non-dimensional weight for the package. In fact, it was cheaper for me to mail it Priority than the standard ground the customer paid for.

I wonder if this is a glitch while they switch over to the new pricing which I believe goes into effect today or if they will be providing us the huge discount moving forward as well.  Anyone else seeing this?

Ebay,"Package signed for, but buyer claims he didn't receive it...","I sold a new sealed Ipad on ebay. A buyer with 450+ feedback bought it. I shipped it out Priority USPS, fully insured and with signature confirmation. The address was an ""apartment"" in San Jose, CA. I use the term loosely, because looking at google maps it looks more like standalone units/houses. According to the buyer they don't have an office, but according to the USPS tracking it was ""DELIVERED FRONT DESK/RECEPTION/MAIL ROOM"" and has a signature that looks pretty close to the name of my buyer, at least I think so.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to get the buyer to check with his neighbors to see if maybe it was delivered to the wrong apartment his response was "" I don't think somebody sing for it because I didn't know my neighbors and even nobody is there most of the time."" Which I suppose means that they won't. So my only option is to check with USPS and tell them that the package never made it to the recipient.

&amp;#x200B;

If USPS refuses to give me the insurance claim, would eBay rule in my favor since I followed all the rules for seller protection? How likely is it that the buyer could be lying?

Ebay,Any tips for generating sales during a terrible slow period?,"I have just been super confused and am reaching out for a little bit of help from some other sellers. I have over 1000 listings in the clothing category and from Jan 2019 to May 2019, I was selling close to or over 130 items a month. Sales were through the roof. But, beginning in June, my sales dropped completely. I will be lucky if I make half of what I was making for the first half of 2019. I've only sold 38 things so far this month. I don't know what I'm doing wrong:

I list everyday

I have sales running

I'm active on my account 

My shipping rates are low and I take best offers 

Yet, it seems like no one views my items anymore. No feedback left, no best offers, no messages.

Ebay,"Overseas buyer wants discount, promising negative feedback","I sold an item to  a buyer who had been sending me offers for months, finally decided to get rid of it and accept one of their offers.  Its a very specific camera lens designed to operate with certain cameras.   Its very rare, I was unable to find comparable lenses or prices /manuals.  I stated the lens is for a certain series of cameras and maybe others.  Its a nikon designed for use with a certain model line, but i was not sure if there were others it could be used with as well.  It turns out it doesn't fit his exact camera, despite being of the correct model line I stated (and despite  having months to research this, they were only able to determine which exact models it is for after purchase) I was unable to find this info prior to sale.  In an ebay message, they conceded the lens is not damaged during shipping in an ebay message:  ""The lens arrived in perfect shape and aesthetically it is as described."" Anyway I tell the buyer return the item and once received i'll send the refund ASAP.  Well this is an issue for them because  they shipped the lens to their relatives to avoid GSP/customs fees.  I shipped it to a US  address.

After threatening with an INAD, they ask for a discount: ""Considering above I could keep the lens if you issue 50% refund to my PayPal account or I am willing to return it (not sure what to do with paid import tax + 53$ that eBay charged me).

I respond saying I will issue refund asap upon receipt of the item, I get the final message:

"" Just to clarify.I will first send the lens to my relatives in the US (it will take about 3 weeks) and then I will open the case so I am not pushed with a time limit for a return. Once the refund is received I will leave negative feedback.""

What do you guys think? I think this guy should send the item directly to me. Not to his relatives, also any recourse since they've said in my inbox that the item WAS as described?

EDIT: Called ebay , the rep agreed it looked like the buyer was threatening negative feedback, he also thought that the seller was trying to extort money out of me by referencing the import tax and US sales tax numbers.  Also agreed that by admitting paying import tax it was proof of being shipped out of US (ireland). He said for sure they could remove any negative feedback but was only able to verbally assure me that I would not have to give a refund when the time comes (when the buyer requests the return).  So according to the rep I won't have to do anything, and the best they could do is revoke buyers money back guarantee status. &amp; I did get a case number.

Ebay,eBay GSP has lost his item and the buyer has opened a case against me,"I recently sold an item worth £400 via the Global Shipping Programme to a buyer in Hungary.  

The item reached the GSP centre on June 12th. According to the tracking it was ""Shipped from the Global Shipping Centre to International Destination"" on June 14th. Estimated delivery was June 21st. 

The last update on the tracking was June 14th so I can only presume it is now lost.

Today the buyer opened a case against me. It says this on the message I received this morning:

*Your buyer opened a request because their item hasn't arrived. It is important for you to respond by 29 Jun 2019.

You can resolve your buyer's request by providing tracking information or any additional delivery details. If you do not have tracking that shows delivery, please consider refunding your buyer.

Your final value fee will be credited if you send a full refund.

The rule is if the customer is not complaining they are satisfied or whatever problems they have with your product is not worth the effort to complain to them.

Ebay,Odd seller behavior - report now or wait it out?,"I purchased an item on June 15th and at first it seemed all was well - the seller marked the item as shipped the next business day but did not provide a tracking number. Two days later I received a message that said they would send the tracking number once the item had shipped. 

Yesterday, I received a message from the seller stating that there had been a mix up at the warehouse and my item was being returned due to “bad address” and that I would need to provide them with an alternative address and informed me that there would be a “significant delay” in shipping. I told them I had no other delivery address (plus I’ve read in the eBay guidelines this is highly discouraged), I verified that my eBay/PP address was correct, and asked for the tracking number so that I could reach out to the carrier directly and find out what the problem was. I’ve never had a non-deliverable package in the 11 years I’ve lived here. 

I received a response today stating that my replacement product would not ship until they received the defective return, still no tracking number. I replied back stating that there was no “defective” product returned, that this was an error on their end or the carrier’s end, again requested a tracking number and an estimate of when the item will ship. 

eBay suggests waiting 3 business days to contact customer service, but the seller’s behavior has raised red flags and I suspect they do not intend to follow through with the sale.

Ebay,Confirmed Glitch with Shipping Policies,"Hey all.

Just got off the phone with eBay where I once again discovered another glitch.

In my shipping policies, I included an option for FedEx Home Delivery in addition to USPS Parcel Select and Priority. Apparently though, in about half the listings using that policy, the FedEx option doesn’t appear on the buyer side as an option.

You may want to give a quick check of some of your listings and click on the “see details” link next to the default shipping option to see if all the options in your shipping policy are actually showing up for buyers.

If you see this too, it wouldn’t hurt to give eBay a call. I figure the more people that report it the more emphasis they will place on trying to fix it.

Cheers,

Christian

Ebay,A couple thoughts on the rising number of shitty buyers/sellers and feedback left,"So I have both a buyer and a seller account and never the 2 shall meet for obvious reasons. I have been thinking about the amount of shitty buyers/sellers that are out there and consequentially feedback that gets left. I have come across a number of shitty sellers and buyers  in my time on ebay and it seems that recently there are just more and more out there. I dunno if its due to the policy's ebay has if its just people getting worse as human beings in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been getting into the habit of checking every buyers feedback left for others to try to gauge if they are going to be a problem or not when I get sales and it seems that more and more frequently buyers are leaving a lot of negs due to crapy sellers and their behavior. Most common are the INR, Cancellations and relisting for higher prices, sellers abusing buyers, wrong item sent etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive also been noticing that the really shitty sellers ALWAYS reply to any neg FB they get with stuff like "" this guy leave the abuse negative feedback always , fault buyer , sellers beware "" and ""  SELLERS BEWARE!!This buyer seems to have ""issues"" with ALOT of seller "" but the better sellers if they leave a follow up leave something like "" please don't worry ,we will solve your issue as soon as we can. "" ect

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at my personal buying account in the last 3 years I have left 1006 feedback for sellers. I leave feedback on all my purchases. Out of the 1006 I have left 24 negs, 16 neutrals.  Most of the negs have been due to INR and having sellers argue or be rude in messages or in cases (I've opened 10 cases in 3 years), wrong items being sent and seller not correcting the issue, canceling and relisting for higher prices or just cancelling with no reason/message and I always state what happened and why I left the FB in the FB.  Neutrals have been left for poor quality or mis-described items.

Ebay,"HELP does anyone has the solution for: ""Sorry, we can't process your payment. Here are your options""","https://i.redd.it/x3u83a4w93731.png

&amp;#x200B;

I am an international buyer, that bought multiple items from around the world with different prices.

Yesterday after wining a bid as usual i tried to pay the seller only to be suprised by this message: "" Unfortunately, we can't process your payment. Here are your options:

Check out with another PayPal method, like the one we're showing now.Select a different payment option.""

After that i said okay tied again and the same message.

I check my paypal and the payment was pending only once and it charged me for each time i tried.

Paypal sent me email after each time and said: ""after initial review we found that your payment may not be in agreement wih our acceptable use policy."".

Paypal i bought about a hundred item from ebay using you now you tell me that payment doesn't follow agreements.

The seller sent me an invoice to cancel the bid.

I don't know what to do now last thing i can think of is that the seller is set to not accept payment from non US maybe?

Mind you his seller account is 5 FB and 0% +ve FB (looks like new seller).

Anyone has any suggestion as to what to do?

This is the first time it happened to me and i can't seem to find any solution online when i searched.",7,4,2019-06-28,EBAY,0.030270405113697052,0.9330445528030396,0.036685019731521606

Ebay,What is going on here?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I found a seller on eBay selling over 200 items at $19.99 with free shipping. They have close to 400 positive reviews and 97% positive feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, they are selling an Ender 3 3D Printer, which is usually priced around 230. However, they are listing it for $19.99. Obviously, this looks like a scam. But with free shipping, free returns, eBay Money Back Guarantee, and a highly low priced item, what are they doing/trying to get out of this? In addition, a lot of their items being sold have no ratings on the items, including this one that I am talking about [https://imgur.com/a/MGGT1zZ](https://imgur.com/a/MGGT1zZ)

Ebay,How does the 50 free listings work with relisting?,"I couldn't really find a clear answer on this. I typically don't list 50 items in a month, but this month I currently have 46 listings running. Now when the 50 free listings resets in July, will some of those be used up automatically by items relisting? So say once July 1st comes around and 25 items automatically relist, I will only have 25 ""free"" listings left for the remainder of the month? As far as I can tell I have never gone over the 50 free, but now that I'm close I am worried I will suddenly get charged for a bunch of insertions.

Ebay,Short Rant.,"If you sell clothing on eBay, especially pants, PUT THE GOSHDANG DOODLY MOTHERMUFFIN SIZE IN YOUR LISTING!  

If you're selling pants, they have both a WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE and a LENGTH. eBay was even so nice as to give you sections within the listing to insert that information so that you can do so without even having to type it in the description. I just missed out on an item I would have happily bought but by the time the seller responded to my message about the missing other half of the pertinent information regarding the pants, they had sold. 

 It's absolutely infuriating for people to go through the trouble of listing something yet be such a lazy a**hole that they only provide pictures not sizes or only half the size. Or even conflicting sizes in the listing size sections vs the title/description.  

Ahhghh.

Ebay,What is going on with the USPS shipping charges? They are WAY up. Larger boxes have almost doubled.,"Did I miss some insane increase? A large box I had to ship to Florida from California was quoted at $76.00??? That was the cheapest option. I had to use FED EX. That same box was around $28.00 last year. The item sold for $91.00. I shipped Fed Ex for $38.00. 

I then noticed again, boxes that usually cost $20.00 to ship, are now $48.00 to ship. Some of these boxes arent that big.

What happened? What do people that sell guitars and stuff do? There had to be some kind of increase lately, Ive never seen charges like this.

Does USPS no longer want the big boxes in their small trucks? Is a way of getting out of the large box business?",96,55,2019-06-30,EBAY,0.04203253239393234,0.9190490245819092,0.03891843557357788
