Ebay,Bought and paid for item. Now seller wants more $$ to ship,"What can I do. This seller has over 270 feedback but three negative in last year. The three negative said he does the same thing. 

I don't want to pay more. What can I do?

**EDIT**

Thanks everyone for the input. After I made a stand via eBay messages he offered a compromise where I pay a bit more but it upgraded the shipping and included insurance (the item was an electric guitar). Using his claimed weight for the item the price he gave me adds up on USPS. I was all set to pay a little extra for Priority and insurance when I saw he shipped it and it said delivery would be in a week! I was furious. I messaged him several times with no response asking why he would agree to do Priority with insurance but then ship it anyway.

Looking at the tracking this morning, now that it is in transit, it is Priority and it is insured as I wanted. He even sent a message saying he just sent it Priority with insurance without me paying extra.

I had to send an apology about how foolish I felt for accusing him...

**TL;DR**

Held my ground on shipping, came to a compromise to upgrade shipping, buyer did it out of his own pocket. Egg on my face. Thanks /r/Ebay",7,6,2016-03-01,EBAY,0.024005956947803497,0.8671306371688843,0.10886340588331223

Ebay,A question for people who have sold stuff on ebay.,"Have you ever noticed that the person who ask for additional photos or for you to provide some random and obscure detail about the item you are selling is never the person who wins the auction or even bids on the item?

Ebay,Help. Seller denying damage. Refusing return.,"I recently opened a return request. Before buying I asked the seller via PM if it had any damage and they said no. Upon receiving I noticed it has the exact type of damage that I asked about.

Seller is now denying the damage even though I sent multiple photos. They say the damage is 'fair wear and tear' due to the item's age, even though they made no mention of it in the listing, no photos of the damage and denied the damage existed when I PM'd them about it before purchase. 

The listing was pick-up only but I asked them if they would post it and they obliged. They are now saying that because the listing was pick-up only that they are not responsible as I should have inspected the item beforehand. 

I am likely to have to escalate this with eBay as it's obvious the seller is not willing to comply with the return request. How likely is it that eBay will decide in my favour? Will the fact that the listing was originally pick-up only hurt my claim? (IIRC they added a postage cost to the listing before I pressed buy it now, they didn't add it to the invoice afterwards). 

Also should I keep debating with them or should I just stop contacting them and wait the required 3 days and escalate it to eBay?",3,3,2016-03-01,EBAY,0.04252123832702637,0.9162073731422424,0.0412713848054409

Ebay,Buyer returning phone due to poor cell reception,"Sold my old cell phone (No returns, as-is), 2 weeks later buyer claims phone is defective and demands a full return.  Says ""Phone powers on and mostly works but it drops calls and sometimes doesn't have service"".  I told them to switch carriers, etc, not my issue.

After a second call I was told I can still get this case closed in my favor once I receive the phone.

How the hell do I prove to eBay that the phone works just fine (as it did when I shipped it) or (my worst fear) the phone has been used for parts and returned in an non-functional condition?

Ebay,Might be getting scammed,"I made a pretty big mistake the other day. I had 2 game codes which I wanted to sell. I figured ebay would be the best option as it would be a quick and easy way to get rid of them. I had a quick look on ebay to see if anyone else was selling game keys for these games, and they were. So I set the price around the same as the competition, but I also had an option open for offers.
Anyway, I hadn't read anything beforehand about listing digital products and assumed it would be quick and easy. I would send the code once they've paid me. What I didn't know is that ebay requires you to also send it via mail.
So I sold the code yesterday. Everything seems fine, payment went through and is now in my bank account. But I've read that people will often report that they didn't receive the code and then get their money back. The accounts that bought the code also seem very strange, both gave me the exact same feedback which was 'A+++'.
So everything seems fine but I can't shake the feeling about there being something off about these accounts. One has 6 feedbacks and one has 0 (I realise this was stupid of me to send to this person).
What would be the best thing for me to do now? Send the codes via post as well and enter the tracking number? If I do this, can the buyer still claim the code was invalid?
Any advice would be appreciated,

Ebay,"Annoying and fishy ebay buyer -- sell item to him, or walk?","An Ebayer has been bugging me about a computer part. He first messaged me a month ago with ""accept $xx."" So I ignored it, because the offer was about the same quality as the writing.

Yesterday he started up again, flooding me with offers. (for context, the item sold for about $50 more to a non-paying bidder, so I was in no rush to get rid of it). Anyway, finally he gets within $25 of the last bid, and I relent. I get in contact with him and list the item at his price. 

He then demanded that I pay for shipping. I refuse, because it was always part of the original auction. He sends email after email telling me to change it, saying he can only pay $2. I refuse. He purchases the item, and says that I can have the $2 or I have to wait a week for payment. I tell him that he has until Sunday, or I am relisting. Today I wake up to find that somebody else paid for the item (fine, whatever) and he is demanding a receipt for warranty purposes. A receipt was not part of the auction, and I do not have it. 26 messages from him later (I sent a total of 3), here I am.

I should have blocked him right away because this nonsense is not worth my time. I'm a little worried that he's going to try to scam me and say that the item is broken, or who knows?
He has 100% positive feedback and a score of 30, but that doesn't seem too impressive.

How should I proceed? Ship the item? Cancel the transaction and refund the money?

Cancelled: ""Got it—we'll let the buyer know that you want to cancel this order. Buyer has up to 10 days to confirm."" ???

Edit: cancelled, told him I don't have the receipt or warranty and he was just like ""ok, no problem""

Ebay,Wondering if any of you have heard of this problem before.,"Hey all, had a quick question.  So I am a frequent eBay buyer/seller.  Recently I bought some stuff from a seller in China, who offered a good rate on shipping.  So he had a eBay store set up, and offered combined shipping on items in his store.  So you would pay the China ePacket shipping rate once, but not more then once on items in the same order.  The issue is, when you added items to your cart, it priced shipping out separately for everything.  So, I added everything to my cart, and then requested an invoice from him where he combined all the shipping.  The issue is, when he combined shipping, it committed me to buying everything in my cart twice, once with shipping set up separately, and once with it combined.  I payed for the committed buy with shipping combined, but I still have the committed items with shipping separate in my cart.  I've messaged the store, but have had no response to getting the extra items removed.  Have you all ever heard of this problem, and is there a way forward with it?

Thank you all very much for any help you can provide.",1,2,2016-03-05,EBAY,0.08233018964529037,0.8836624026298523,0.03400743752717972
Ebay,eBay Flat Rate Shipping Confusion -- am I missing something?,"While using the eBay app (iPhone), I have been listing a series of items. Mostly going okay, but suddenly I'm seeing that my listings are showing Free Shipping, which I never selected. I fix this on the site via the computer.

Going back, and trying to list additional items, I select ""Calculate Shipping by Buyer Location"", then select ""USPS Flat Rate X"" (where X = flat rate medium box, flat rate padded envelope, etc.)

I get an error during submission, saying I have to weigh &amp; measure the package or envelope. No, I don't; it's flat rate and has never asked me that before. 

So I go back and select ""Flat Rate for all buyers"", and then select the Flat Rate Box or Envelope, but don't enter a cost, and it assumes I mean ""Free Shipping"".

Okay, I see that, but I've *never* entered a cost there and always used Flat Rate USPS for shipping, and cannot recall it doing this (i.e., defaulting to free shipping and/or asking me to weigh and measure the package).

Shouldn't choosing ""USPS Flat Rate xxx"" = no need to weigh/measure package nor enter a shipping fee? Am I missing something here in a setting somewhere; can someone help?",7,2,2016-03-05,EBAY,0.19105350971221924,0.7861248850822449,0.022821573540568352

Ebay,Suspension advice?,"Last week I was suspended from ebay after 18 years as a seller, selling at the time of suspension about $10,000 per month, give or take.  My store had over 6000 items in it.  95% of my items were in the breweriana category so I had many repeat customers.  But I also tend to deal in items worth less than $10 so I bring a lot of new collectors into the hobby too.  I do a lot of volume and despite receiving about one negative per 300 transactions, my feedback score currently is 99.6, and I have always maintained an above average seller score.

In late January an ebay user contacted me wondering if I would give him a discount if he purchased all of my items of a particular kind.  These were a specific kind of beer ad pulled from old LIFE magazines.  He said ""I am trying to collect them all to decorate my sons bar"" I said sure! and requested that he go through the ""make offer"" function, which he did.  He purchased 42 beer ads in two transactions totaling $132.97.  That was about half price.  I even threw in a half-dozen extra, just because I was feeling nice.  I charged him $3.99 shipping, which, of course was about one-third the cost of actual postage.

When he received the ads he immediately requested a return.  He claimed they were NOT (sic) as described, which is surprising because I had very large 1200 pixel tall scans of the actual ads that I sent him.  He said he could see through the paper and they were useless to frame.  I have sold hundreds of magazine ads.  People frame them all the time.  Regardless, I accepted the return.

At this point I was out of town for the weekend so I admit a lack of diligence in promptly answering my emails.  One of the emails took about 30 hours to answer.  He began a return for each of the 42 items.  I went in and approved one item and ebay's system prompted me to send him a shipping label at the cost of $3.99 - for just the one of the 42 items...  I did the math and 42 shipping labels at $3.99 would be far more than the cost of the entire sale.  So I called ebay for advice.  They suggested that I ask him to send the items back and I did.  He responded with the unfounded worry that I would receive the items and not reimburse him.  His suggestion was for me to reimburse him half his payment until I recieved the ads.  This would have been fine if his payment hadn't already been held in escrow because of the return.  If I sent him $70 it would have had no ties to the transaction and I still would have been on the hook for the entire reimbursement.  I suggested he call ebay in hopes that they would tell him what they had told me.  Instead he escalated all 42 items to claims.   Within a couple of hours ebay had settled all 42 cases against me.   I was non-responsive, they said.   As expected, the customer had also saddled me with 42 negative feedbacks. 

So I called again concerning this return.  I pointed out that I had, in fact, been been responsive and that I had been attempting to work out the details of a complicated return that was going to be fair to both me and the customer.  I noted that just two days earlier I had contacted ebay myself looking for advice on how to resolve the situation.  I pointed to the correspondence that they had missed (since it was through a specific item and not one of the return requests).  In it they found the customer right from the first email had threatened me with filing a claim, and apparently THAT is a big no-no. 

Because of this new information ebay reversed their position on the claim, expunged 40 of the 42 negatives, and reimbursed me the refunded payment.  Unfortunately they did not remove all of the claims.  They left 27 of them on my record.

On the 25th of last month ebay changed their algorithms for calculating seller levels.  In an instant my account went from ""Above Standard"" to ""Below Standard"", and ebay sent me a note saying I had 60 days to clean it up.  No problem, I thought, I can be on my best behavior for two months...  So I increased my communication levels.  One of my customers had ordered an Item that I was having a hard time finding in my vast inventory.  Instead of stalling while I tried to find it or buying another from one of my collector friends I simply put in a cancel/out of stock request through ebay, and I contacted the buyer saying I'll let you know when I find one.  This was a $3 bottle opener.  Well apparently that was enough for ebay to think I was on a slippery slope into the gutter.  When March 1 came around (four days later), the new reviews found me even more lacking and I was banned.  ""Indefinitely"".

I called ebay again.  They said there was nothing they could do.  I called again.  I got a friendly voice this time, who gave me instructions on how to appeal via email my suspension.  I was skeptical.  Then, after understanding better the facts and figures about WHY my account was below standard I called again, got to appeals, and I was shut down again. 

The Facts are that this one customer's transaction counts for 27 of the 28 ""cases closed without seller resolution"".  He also accounts for 27 of 45 return requests (out of over 1200 transactions) over the past year.  Without his $130 sale my record would be pretty dang good.

So I composed an appeal letter and sent it.  Here it is:

And this is the letter I received in return.

Ebay,I'm a new seller most likely getting scammed,"So I got a new phone and sold my old phone on ebay. Finally got a buyer and he received the phone today and wants to return it because he said he received bubble wrap and a brick. Messaged him back to deny refund and request pictures (per ebay's advice...bad advice at that) because I KNOW I sent him the phone and everything I had for it. Pretty sure he's trying to scam me. What can I do? Funds being held up at Paypal because a return was requested. Thanks in advance.

UPDATE: Fine people of Reddit. I have come out of this experience...the victor! I pretty much did what everyone said. Told him i'm filing a claim, explain that he might want to call the authorities on his end as I would be doing it on my end. Even blacklisted the IMEI number. The last thing I did was ask him to send me a picture of the package with said brick on a scale with the weight visible. I assumed it might be needed for a claim...he wrote me back to tell me that the package was thrown out...brick, box, and everything else. I immediately called ebay and told them that I can't refund him because I told him I would be filing a claim and he threw the package out. Now I have nothing to file a claim on. Then boom.

Case closed in my favor.

UPDATE #2: Bah! Foiled again! He called ebay and appealed the decision and since it was his first time ""buying"" on ebay they refunded him the money as a courtesy.

Ebay,Is there something going on? I don't sell very often -- listed 5 cell phones and 4 buyers are requesting cancellation.,"I've been an eBay member since Sept 1998.  I don't sell very often but a few times a year I'll list some items that I'd prefer not throw away or think may have value to someone else.

I've got a perfect rating of around 300.

Last week I listed 5 broken cell phones.  They were all listed with photos and included descriptions disclosing all issues with what was wrong with them.  They also were listed under ""for parts"" and included an ""sold as-is"" in the description.

They all sold for between $5 and $210.  

Today I get emails from 4 of the buyers saying things like, ""Sorry -- I didn't realize this was a broken phone.  Please cancel.""   ""Bad description, please cancel.""  ""Does this phone work?!""  ""I have a problem with my paypal, cancel my order.""

These are clearly bidders that made stupid bids for something that they now don't want.  I feel like it's not fair to other sellers to just cancel but I'm not sure I want the hassle of reporting them as non-paying.

What should I do and should I even relist?  Is this how all transactions go or did I just hit the jackpot for morons today?",8,3,2016-03-08,EBAY,0.1175043135881424,0.8574989438056946,0.024996692314743996
Ebay,"How do ""fake"" accounts keep winning my damn auction???","Many years ago, I used to run an eBay business in my spare time selling cell phones and made a decent amount of money each month with it. Nowadays, I still use that same account but may only sell 3-4 phones a year.

I'm currently trying to sell an iPhone. As of right now, I just had my 3rd auction for that phone end. Each time I've listed this phone, within the last few minutes of the auction, an account that's less than a year old with only 3 or 4 generic reviews will place the winning bid well above what the other person placed. They end up winning the auction and then I never hear from them again. No messages, no payment, nothing. I have attempted contact but of course never get a response. So, I'm forced to file a non-payment claim and relist.

It's been a different account each time. I have NEVER had this problem before and I've been selling phones on eBay for at least 6 or 7 years. It's absolutely ridiculous. What can I do?? Why is this happening??",8,3,2016-03-08,EBAY,0.06515900045633316,0.9053274989128113,0.029513483867049217

Ebay,Questions about a dispute as a buyer,"Looking for some advice from eBay sellers who may know the rules as I haven't sold for several years and the rules may have changed.

I purchased a Xbox 360 4gb slim for $50 + $15 shipping. Long story short I received the item and it's not a 360 4gb model but a 250gb model with the drive removed and the console itself had been opened (Microsoft seal broken) which the auction made no indication of. It didn't explicitly state that it was just for the console and I thought I would receive the controller and cables.

I contacted the seller and was pretty much told that I can return the item and pay a 20% restocking fee and return shipping which I obviously refuse to do.

As far as not receiving accessories and the console being opened I was told I should have read the description which just says ""pictures are representative of what you will receive"" buried in the middle of their template.

If I escalate this to eBay how likely are they to side with me? This is a power seller who is pretty shady and I had no idea how they kept their status until I received an e-mail saying that if I leave positive feedback I will get a credit to their store...

However, the buyer (understandably) became impatient and opened a case. Now Ebay has ruled in his favour and screwed me completely by refunding him the money.

So I found an answer to my original question.  Apparently there would be a $5 to $15 pickup charge depending on address.  So that begs the question, how does a smaller seller actually use UPS?  That is simply cost prohibitive as it would have to be eaten by me the seller. 


I have avoided UPS shipping for as long as possible and am investigating now due to selling some heavier items.  So I have UPS setup through Paypal and it appears the discount is applied when selected through and auction.  My question is this, can I schedule a free pickup of my items or do I have to pay a pickup fee?  I simply cannot find the answer to that question.

Ebay,Should I follow through on a return offer after 50 days when a buyer finally answers?,"In early December, a buyer purchases one of my listings and sends a message 3 weeks later saying they would like a warranty replacement due to a manufacturer's defect.  We followed up with our manufacturer, communicated the problems the buyer was experiencing, and heard back from the manufacturer it was working as designed and the buyer's complaint was likely the result of old faulty cables (car engine related) because their claim was not supported from the rigorous testing the product goes through.

That same week, (early January) I offered to take back the item and partially refund them, treating it as if the transaction never took place despite it being used and most likely altered.  For some reason, the buyer wanted to talk over the phone--probably to communicate off the record, and accused us of being a fraudulent company(??) because we refused to communicate over the phone. Our last message (Jan 20) to the buyer repeated we were willing to partially refund them.  I felt the issue was resolved since the buyer never responded.

However, today (Mar 11) the buyer sent a message saying they are going to return ship the product for a prompt refund.  Unfortunately, I am no longer willing to provide that partial refund since it has been almost 50 days from the last message.  I did not explicitly state the offer had an expiration date (will do so for future transactions) and I feel a reasonable amount of time has passed that I no longer should be held to that offer.

I was looking for facts, not opinion and negative comments from people under the false assumption that this is illegal, which I already know it's not.  Thanks.

I sell a lot of these on eBay.  I cover my ass completely in the description of the item.  I purchased every single movie the code comes from and I offer to mail the code upon request.  I never had a dispute or issue with the codes.  Then one day, eBay suspended me for 7 days for selling them and took off a portion of my listings off eBay.  What I find odd is they left a few still up there.. Majority of them have been sold but some of them are still there to this day, three weeks later.

I want to call them and ask but I am nervous they'll take my other digital code listings off or even suspend me longer.  I followed all of their requirements for selling codes according to the digital goods link they sent me.  If I post more codes, will they suspend me again?  If I call will that only raise more flags?  Did I get busted because I probably had 300+ codes posted or sold in a matter of days?  Is there a way to fly under the radar?  Any help would be great seeing how I rely on eBay to sell other things.

Thanks in advanced.",19,4,2016-03-11,EBAY,0.02985517680644989,0.9234007000923157,0.04674408584833145

Ebay,Free custom software,"I've seen a few of these offers in /r/web_design &amp; other subreddits that end pretty well.  

I'm a software developer with 10+ years experience in eCommerce.  I've worked with the eBay &amp; Amazon APIs extensively as well as flat file interchange for countless other channels (Rakuten, Yugster, etc).  Some of the projects I've worked on include:

* Amazon product review monitoring - automatically receive updates if any of your branded products get a negative review or if an update falls below a threshhold.

* Shipping tracker - Follow a tracking number's status from printing the label to delivered.  Easily spot tracking numbers which were not shipped (useful for dropshippers), delayed, returned to sender or held for pickup.

* Custom Repricers - you have the ability to dynamically reprice in marketplaces where repricers do not exist - NewEgg, NewEgg Business, Rakuten, Best Buy, etc.

* Market gap reports - You sell on Amazon &amp; competition is normally stiff.  You want to be alerted when any combination of vendors, average price &amp; rank changes in your favor.

For the past year I've worked freelance charging customers for exactly this kind of work, but now that I've taken on a JR developer, I need projects that allow me to teach this young, green candidate.

Ebay,UPDATE: Counterfeit return resolution,"Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/49rkdb/oh_how_i_love_when_buyers_attempt_to_force/

I uploaded my receipt and waited.  I ended up having to call eBay today for another issue, and since that got escalated to a 2nd level appeals rep, I asked him to review this case also.  He confirmed that the receipt IS NOT enough evidence to close the case in my favor, but based on the buyers messages, their lack of response to my request for proof, and my standing with eBay (gold powerseller, top rated, etc.) they offered to refund the buyer on my behalf.  Good enough for me!

The one thing the rep stressed is that if a buyer claims counterfeit, we're pretty much screwed since there's no reliable way to verify the receipt being uploaded belongs to the item the buyer is sent - something we can thank all of the scammers who used to buy the item once and use the single receipt to back up all of the fakes they are selling.  The rep did say to go ahead and upload the receipt though - since a lot of buyers aren't aware that the receipt doesn't help anything, he said that many will just close the case once it's uploaded.  THE EXCEPTION is if the buyer has a bunch of reports on their record of doing the same thing, but that's not enough for me to gamble a case closed w/o resolution defect.

Ebay,Posting problem customer on Bad Buyers List results in fraudulent return.,"Here's my story, just figured I'd let other sellers know the danger of posting on sites such as Bad Buyers List, at least within the return window.



About a month ago, I sold a brand new item to a buyer. They sent me a rude message claiming it was my fault they had to drive to the post office.. twice, and that the package had signature confirmation, even though it never did.


After tons of messages, them claiming damage, and refusing to provide pictures, I thought everything was over. I blocked, reported, and posted their basic info on Bad Buyers List, to inform other sellers to avoid them like the plague.




Today I get three emails from Bad Buyers List.. they responded, and called me names. I also get a nice shiny return request from them comment ""defective"" Nothing else was said, no other messages from them.




In the end I have about $250 on the line, and a buyer who is threatening legal action and saying to cease and desist because I replied to the case and sent them a few messages asking what they want.



Does anyone have any insight? I called eBay earlier, but they wouldn't help.. no Americans available. 

Will update with case outcome. Stay safe out there, there's crazy people everywhere, and they will not hesitate to beat a dead horse.",6,4,2016-03-12,EBAY,0.20249724388122559,0.7693074941635132,0.028195258229970932

Ebay,Best way to automate listings?,"My dad has been selling part time on ebay since the late 90s, but he's finally retiring and wants to get his small part-time business to a retirement business.

I worked with him for one summer when I had off of school and the slowest thing by far was listing on eBay. I always thought - there has to be a faster way to do this, but we floated around 150 items up at all times, and I think the biggest amount we put up in one sitting was ~40 items. But it's just too slow, and honestly, eBay's site is absolute shit.

He wants to try to get up to 400 items. How do I automate the listing process? Obviously I could use TurboLister, but is there anything better? FileExchange seems like a good choice - how are picture uploads automated?

Ebay,Doing a raffle on eBay?,"So I've been selling on eBay for several months now. Recently I've been buying lots of shoes and reselling them individually, mainly Jordan's. I noticed that some sellers will list their shoes as a raffle for $20, where they sell a bunch of ""tickets"" for the shoes, and one winner gets picked at the end. (For context, new Jordan's can cost $200 or more). I thought I might try this to earn more money (sell 25 tickets at $20, that's $500). So I searched ""how to do a raffle on eBay"" which brought me to this page 
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-bonus-prize-giveaway-raffle.html
which clearly states that any sort of raffle is prohibited. however, there are also multiple people selling Jordan's as raffles. If you go and search ""jordan raffle"", you will find many items listed that way. (And no, I do not have any items listed as a raffle).

These people make it fairly obvious in their listings what is happening. Also, I noticed that a good chunk of the sellers doing this have good feedback ratings. Which makes me think that either there must be some sort of loophole here which these sellers have found, eBay is terrible at enforcing these things, or eBay just doesn't care.

I ordered a 3DS for my mom's birthday and had it delivered to my mom's house so she could open the package on her birthday since I'm off at college. I admit this was a bad idea because by the time I got home to check it, it was past the sellers 14 day return policy. Anyway, this thing was DISGUSTING. There was a HUGE scratch on the screen, there was some sort of black gunk in the crevices, the circle pad was yellow instead of grey, it was stuck and wouldn't move, and the whole thing reeked of smoke. Ok, no big deal, I'll return it. I opened up a case with eBay like I've done every time I've needed to return an item. I also contacted the seller and told them these issues and asked for a refund once the item was returned to them. I got a message back where the seller accused me of doing this to the DS and having buyer's remorse and yelled at me for opening a case with eBay without talking to them first after their 14 day return policy. I responded immediately and apologized for the late response and opening a case without messaging him first, as I thought that was the way you handled returns, and explained the circumstances and asked if he would let me return it. Eventually eBay had to settle the case and they decided in my favor so I sent it back as soon as I could. After it was delivered to him I got a message calling me a skank and a thief and he left feedback for me repeating these sentiments and made claims that I had broken his system. I gave him negative feedback as well and stated that I did this because he was being abusive. He responded by saying that I stole from him and was was a liar and a scammer. I told him that if there were any issues he should contact me or eBay. I thought everything was over and I could forget about this and get my mom a nice birthday present, but today I checked my account and saw I got another message again calling me a skank and a ho and he said that he had deleted the feedback I left him.

Ebay,eBay / PayPal and a voided shipping label snafu,"I have a problem with funds being held by PayPal for a delivered item for which I had to void the first USPS label I generated.

I know I’m going to have to contact eBay and / or PayPal for this, but what’s the best way to get it resolved quickly?

I sold an BIN item and the buyer paid via PayPal. I generated a USPS mailing label and then realized that I’d forgotten to insure the item. I followed the eBay procedure to void the mailing label, created a new one and shipped the item on March 8.

The item was delivered to the buyer on March 11.

When I click the tracking number in eBay, it shows both the one I voided and the replacement. There is no option to remove the voided one.

PayPal and eBay are both showing the funds as pending until March 19. The tracking number that PayPal ~~has~~ had is the one that I voided. I was able to edit the tracking number last night and replace the voided one with the one that was delivered, but PayPal is still holding the funds.

I’ve received the funds for more recent sales already and I’d like to be finished with this one.

Should I simply wait until March 19 or should I start trying to solve this with eBay or PayPal?",2,1,2016-03-15,EBAY,0.04497859627008438,0.9223994016647339,0.03262203931808472

Ebay,How to nicely tell a buyer to stop bothering you?,"For the past month, I've had a buyer (zero feedback of course) ask me about a product I was selling for $100.  He said he had a sister who had cancer and wanted to buy it for her, but wanted a discount.  I offered $90, he said it was still too much.  I said I couldn't go any lower, and give him links to other sellers to show that at $100 I was already the cheapest seller.    

He then asks if we could meet up locally so I could give him a lower price, since I would not have to pay Ebay or Paypal fees.  I refuse.  Basically there was a 20 message exchange of him trying to get it cheaper when I was already the cheapest seller there!  It basically went ""I am sorry, I can't go any lower, I am already the cheapest seller here.""  ""But I can't afford that!  Can't you go any lower?""  ""No, I can't.""  ""But I am trying to buy it for my sister.""  

Forward a week, he messages me to ask if I planned on getting the lower models of the product I was selling.  I had been thinking about it, so I told him I would contact him if I did.    

Now he messages me every two or three days asking if I've ordered it, and when it would be in.  Finally, I just told him the company I ordered it from said they wouldn't be able to get me the cheaper model.  He then inquired about the current models that I have.  I simply said the models I have were more than what he wanted to pay.    

I've since blocked this buyer - but I get the feeling it's not the last I'll hear from him.  What's a nice way to say, ""I don't want to do business with you.""",15,8,2016-03-16,EBAY,0.16907775402069092,0.7970346808433533,0.0338875837624073
Ebay,HELP! Seller asking me to return the item but not to open a Return Request on eBay,"Hi,

So I bought a phone om eBay that said ""New"", but actually came in what seemed to be like ""used"" state. I was pretty sure it was used before, and it has an issue with the screen that it is unusually dim. I contacted the seller about this and the seller suggested not to open a return request on eBay. However, at the same time h also has sent me a prepaid shipping label to my paypal E-Mail address with an RMA asking me to send the item back for a refund.

Now I'm a little concerned because this is all technically happening outside eBay. I mean, eBay is not aware of the return situation here. So there are actually chances for the seller to receive the item and claim he never received it, as eBay isn't tracking all this.

My questions:

1. Is it safe to do so?

2. Well, all this conversation is being exchanged via eBay messages, but will eBay monitor those messages or at least have access to those messages so that I can show them as the evidence for the return?

3. What is the actually recommended process for my situation? Should I really open the return request and keep it official (so that eBay knows all this easily)?

Now, he asked what email to send it to, cause he wants to send me the $100 using normal paypal transaction which makes me wonder. As you can do a refund directly from the transaction (the $150 he sent me), why would he not do that? Is this a scammer or do I go with it?

So, I opened up a case with eBay, filed a IC3.gov complaint (FBI Internet Crime), and filed a Mail Fraud Complaint. As expected, sadly, eBay went ahead and issued the refund. eBay's representatives on the other line from their Leadership Teams said they believed me, could see the photos I was showing, and then told me they would still side with the buyer. So the ""refund"" was just processed. The plot thickened, as the buyer email changed between transactions.

This is ridiculous, but hopefully the IC3 complaint comes through. I want to notify as many possible agencies as I can about this matter.

Ebay,Help with a buyer complaining about a camera,"Hey guys, 

***My question:***

I sold a second hand medium format film camera kit on ebay UK. 

I was slow to post it and the buyer filed a claim, then when it arrived he said the following:

–––––––

BUYER: Well you eventually sent the camera, I’m not that happy with it nothing is in excellent condition, the prism is dented and scratched all over the camera is not that great, the film door and base plate are also quite badly scratched the plastic is split just above the flash sockets. The front section of the 200mm lens has some seep scratches to the plastic and there’s some kind of oil on the rear glass that keeps smearing across the glass when I try and clean it. The lens will need to professionally cleaned I can’t clean it. The 90mm and 45mm lenses are OK but not that great certainly not in excellent condition with light marks and scratches. Given all the issues I think it would be best to return the kit for a full refund or would accept a £80 partial refund
––––––––

**to which I replied:
**

&gt; ME (SELLER):Hello there. Thanks for your message and hope you are well. Shall call / chat about about this on the phone? It seems a shame you are unhappy with the maybe that's easier than back and forth on here. What's your number / Skype? Mine is XXXXXXXX

––––––––

BUYER: I don't do skype and I prefer email. Given your ludicrously over egged description I expect you want to brow beat me into something more in your favour. I'm busy and can do without the hassle.*

––––––––

My intuition is that he's not trying to scam me hard, but has gotten cold feet on an otherwise ok sale (it was about £500) Also, the camera was in excellent condition for vintage and had great photos so you could see the condition just fine.  I have no idea about the oil on the lens or the crack, that concerns me because I checked everything was fine before it went out. 

Fortunately, buy coincidence my mother lives about 10 minutes drive from his address so i'd like her to pop over and take a look before offering a refund. Is this ok within ebay policy? How would you guys proceed? 

I don't want to offer the £80 partial refund –  would rather keep the camera. But if I give a full refund will my ebay seller fee also be refunded?

Ebay,Should I be concerned about this buyer?,"I'm selling a tech item on eBay which had an auction start of $99 and a BIN of $600. I had a bid initially, but last night it was retracted. This morning, someone purchased it for the BIN and paid immediately to my Paypal account.


The reason I'm concerned is that:

  * The eBay ship-to name doesn't match the PayPal name, the PayPal name is Chinese characters (I disallowed international shipping), and the email address is *@126.com, which I've read is a common domain used by scammers

  * The ship-to address is an obscure freight company on the west coast with a Chinese name (to reiterate, I disallowed international shipments)

  * The user has a (9) 100% rating; but it's all for selling the same cheap SD card, and they all shipped from China

It sounds like this is going to be shipped indirectly to China, and I'm concerned that that will undo some of my protections if the deal goes south. I already received the money (confirmed via the PayPal app, not email), but I know that under some circumstances this can be reversed without warning.

Ebay,"Can I just say this? If at all possible, sellers should avoid using the GSP.","I get it. The Global Shipping Program simplifies things from the seller's perspective. Any mistakes in shipping are no longer the concern of the seller, but rather Pitney Bowes.

But from the perspective of the buyer, the GSP is absolutely horrific. It loses out on pretty much every metric.

It is more expensive for the buyer than conventional shipping methods. Most sellers are unaware of this because they don't see what the GSP charges, but it's true. The GSP costs more. The shipping costs scale with how much the item is valued, almost, if not always costing more than USPS would charge for a similar package.This means that a small item can have an enormous shipping cost, despite the size of the packet in which it is sent. Considering the lack of transparency behind the GSP, this is frustrating.

In fact, it's worse than just that. Ebay often tacks custom fees onto the PayPal transaction, supposedly so that the buyer can avoid paying the customs fees at the post office. The thing is, the customs fees charged by Ebay are often completely arbitrary, not taking into account import regulations. To exemplify, it is not uncommon for a buyer to be forced to pay customs fees through Ebay that otherwise would not exist when collecting the package from the post office. I don't actually know where that money goes, but as a buyer, it is infuriating to know that a product I am buying is being forced on me at an arbitrarily inflated price. Recently, I purchased a $60 item through the GSP that also charged me $20 in import duties. Having purchased similar items before, the import fees from the post office are not actually enforced on these items until at least a value of $100 is declared (ballpark figure, I believe the actual number is closer to $120).

I've heard some say the GSP is faster. Maybe it is, but in experience it really isn't it. It's all still shipping from Erlanger, which is an airport where post is shipped out at predetermined schedules, not by realtime demand. If your package arrived at Erlanger two weeks or two hours before the relevant flight is leaving, it's completely luck. However, the difference is that all GSP mail is shipped from Erlanger (I think, at least that is what I've concluded from my own experiences), while USPS ships from multiple airports that are not nearly as inconsistent with waiting times as Erlanger is.

I can't say I've ever had a package from the US or the UK go missing in transit, either by USPPS, Royal Mail, or Pitney Bowes, but from what I've heard others say, the interface with Pitney Bowes is not nearly as peachy as Ebay likes to claim. To get some idea of this, all you need to do is go to the Pitney Bowes website. It is not at all formatted for private customers, but rather oriented towards companies. I admit this is a relatively minor point, since legitimate international shipping issues can be inconvenient irrespective of the carrier.

The overarching point to this is that from the perspective of customer (buyer) service the GSP is an atrocity. I'm sure it varies from country to country, but in my experience shipping out packages for international destinations isn't *that* bad, even when doing bulk orders. While I'm sure many of the sellers using the GSP do it because they really don't want to have to deal with what can sometimes be an international shipping nightmare and they simply don't care that they lose business because of how unattractive Pitney Bowes is, I'm equally certain there are just as many sellers who have no idea how annoying this thing is.

If I'm missing some of the logic as to why some sellers enter into the GSP, please let me know because I don't want to be thought of as defacing sellers or simply ranting. And I could be totally wrong about this entire issue, but the few US sellers I know have hinted that their international sales kind of suck after implementing GSP. If you want more volume in international sales, I strongly recommend disabling the program. If you're doing it deliberately because you know it scares aware international buyers, that's totally fair. It's just really unappealing from the customer's perspective.",17,5,2016-03-20,EBAY,0.059611350297927856,0.9090754985809326,0.03131308779120445

Ebay,"Sorry Ebay, I'm gone. It's you, not me.","I have been selling on Ebay for almost 20 years, most of that as a hobby. Mostly had great experiences. I now run an online business, and use Ebay for my company. My Ebay sales of dwindled to about 5% of our total sales. Our own site and Amazon have done the other 95%. We have about 1000 listings on Ebay that we built over the past 7 years. We wholesale the same products so we haven't had a need to update the listings, and make a lot of new listings. 

Ebay decided I needed to update information recently on all 1000+ listings, or they would cancel my listings. From a cost perspective this was not worth it to me so I am closing shop for my business on Ebay. I get they are trying to make the Ebay experience better, but a more complex place to sell that is less and less popular isn't of interest to my business.

I had hoped Ebay would be yin to the Amazon's yang. Amazon is the new ""fee-bay"" and Ebay had a great opportunity to become the sellers best friend by stepping up their seller support and being better than Amazon. Sadly that never happened. They are still forceful and robotic to their sellers, just as Amazon is.

When I was still doing 20k in sales per month with Ebay (about 4 years ago) there was a problem with one of my products. The manufacture went out of business. Suddenly we had tons of orders for a certain product that we had a limited supply of. I was out of town and my staff missed what was going on and we oversold what we had by 10 units. So we couldn't fulfill 10 customer orders. I wrote apologetic emails to every customer explaining what happened and they understood. I didn't receive one negative. I had 100% positive feedback and was a top-rated power seller.

The next week I got an email from Paypal saying they were freezing my account because of the issue. It was an automated security they had. I had to wait 30 days and then they would unfreeze. But they told me to keep selling, the money would just pile up.

I understood their automated system, but figured a phone call would fix this. I had sold millions of dollars on Ebay with a flawless record, of course anybody would understand what happened here and see that they did not have to fear me as a seller that would scam them. I was wrong.

5 phone calls to all levels of Ebay and nothing. All rehearsed crap. They just kept repeating the policy and usually the people I spoke with weren't intelligent enough to repeat back to me what I was saying. Everything I said fell on deaf ears. It wasn't the money, it was the principal. Most of my business was off Ebay and I could survive my money being tied up. Anyway, in protest I turned my vacation settings on for the month, and made a show of it on a variety of sites. 

At this point it doesn't really matter. Ebay is losing, and they continue to renew their commitment to treating the sellers like crap. They are like Comcast but with an uncompetitive product.

Ebay,"Buyer not received item, not accepting my proof of postage","Hi, I'm fairly new to ebay so this is making me worry a lot.

I had several auctions for some video games running last week which all ended on the Friday (18th), I sent all the items on the Saturday (admittedly at about 7PM due to my shift at work ending late but my local post office operates until 9PM) via Royal Mail 1st Class, I got proof of postage for all which I sent photos of to the respective buyers.

I wake up this morning to 4 positive feedbacks for 4 of the items but 1 buyer had sent me a message saying their item hadn't arrived and they wanted the tracking info. I had asked about tracking at the post office but they said I only got it through ""Special Delivery Guaranteed"" but it was a lot more expensive than 1st Class (and 1st Class was what was put on the postage info on my items) so I apologised and resent the proof of postage.

They messaged me back saying that they believed my proof of postage to be fake and are now threatening to open a case against me unless I refund them in full.

I really don't know what to do about this as it may be just that the parcel will be delivered later than expected or they may be trying to con me into giving my money back. I sent them another message saying to contact me back in a few days if it hasn't arrived and I will go to my post office to see what can be done, they have yet to reply to that.

All I know is now I'll spend that bit extra on getting the ""signed for"" service which will ease my mind a bit more.

Ebay,"BIN Best Offer, does this even work anymore???","Hello again everybody.  So I have quite a few items I have been selling recently, these are pretty unique items but there are enough to get a pattern of what a fair price is.  The demand on some of these does really ebbs and flows so I use BIN instead of auctions and have by default set ""Or Best Offer"" on them.  My prices are very much in line with past sales and I figure on some of the larger items I am willing to take a 20% hair cut with an offer, but lately the offers are horribly low.  Take for instance an item I have listed for $100, past sales indicate $85 to $125 is fair, what is the offer?  $25, I don't even bother to counter as the gap is just to far to justify.  Another item I have listed for $30 with 15 people watching it and I get a $5 offer on it, the thing weights six pounds so after fees this would be a wash.

Ebay,Scammed as a seller,"So I sold an item on eBay UK, the buyer's account was good and the payment went through too. eBay told me to post the item or let the buyer collect it locally since I allowed for both.

Will eBay give me money back for this? I still have the funds in my PayPal but I presume they will give those funds back to the scammed buyer.

It's just sold again to another zero review, newly registered user (registered today). This time though, they are in-country and Ebay hasn't sent me a mail saying they are suspicious. Buyer asked me for an invoice through eBay. I sent them a spontaneous email just to gauge their response. I said hello, thanked them for buying and asked what kind of photography they were into, they just replied: 

""Thanks for your response.You can send any good pics and aslo send me your paypal email so that i can make the payment tonight. Regards""

The address is listed in Florida, but the telephone number is Minnesota area code.

Ebay,"First time leaving negative feedback in over 10 years, I don't feel bad about it.","Long story short, everyone here knows that china is dominating on eBay. I have not come across a single thing that i wanted that i could not get a version of for cheap from china. I have been buying that way for years now. Over the years i have had a few minor issues, but never really as a result of negligence of the seller. Until yesterday......

Weeks ago i ordered 2 sticks of RAM from china to replace a set on a really old PC that's ram finally went bad. I didnt order from china because they were cheap this time, but because it was really the only place i could find it new. It is not standard DDR sizes and such.

Yesterday i received the item, i knew when i reached into the mailbox there was problems, and after opening it i found i was right. They threw the ram sticks into a ziplock style bag, threw it into one of those cheap white/grey plastic envelopes most sellers from china use, then expected it to make it half way around the planet in good condition.

I wrote the seller, and they gave me this line about ""i know your a smart person and understand that it is the shipping companies fault not ours"" Further wanted me to take the time to go through taking pictures, so i did. After sending the pictures, I got a request that i needed to take pictures of the plastic envelope that they sent it in. I replied that it had been thrown away as i am not in the habit of hanging on to dirty wrapping supplies. At that point i was ready to be done. This issue was not worth any more of my time as it was merely a $6.00usd purchase and i felt like i had already wasted about $20 worth of time. So i left negative, but HONEST feedback, and washed my hands of it. Today i got this seriously long message from the seller, trying to make me feel bad for being honest, further pretty much offering to pay me to change the feedback by offering a refund AFTER all the garbage they put me through.


This was my reply letter back to them:

I left HONEST feedback. It cost me $6.00 to do so. A fair price to pay to let others know of your shipping practices before they suffer the same problems I did. Too many foreign sellers on eBay are trying to buy peoples feedback to cover their poor shipping practices and for $6.00 its worth it for me to let other buyers know. 

When a person puts faith in your business that even though you are half way around the world you are going to respect them as a customer and understand that their willingness to wait weeks for an item means that they expect that item to arrive in good condition the first time. When i received my damaged item it was 100% clear to me that your business did not care about the state in which this item arrived to me as it was packaged poorly before it left your facility. it is NOT the shipping companies fault. They expect then when you deliver a package to them for transport, that it is packaged accordingly to the distance it has to travel for the item that you are shipping. Putting fragile small circuit boards in a ziplock bag with a tiny piece of bubble wrap then putting them in a flimsy plastic envelope and expecting them to travel around the world and arrive in good condition is not the fault of the shipping company, it is the fault of the person shipping the item.

You can keep the $6, its a small price to pay for honesty in my book. Use it to invest in better shipping practices.

Ebay,"So, it turns out seller is on vacation and can't ship til next week...","I won an auction on a piece of clothing Wednesday. I am so used to sellers shipping quickly that I sort of took it for granted that the item would go out the next day.

But seller messages me that he's on vacation and won't be able to ship til he comes back monday. 

Do I have cause to cancel for this reason, or would that make me a a-hole? Can I ask the seller to expedite the package? Or do I just suck it up? Is it irresponsible of the seller to spring this on me after I purchase?

Ebay,My ebay fraud adventure,"I bought a FPGA board that came with multisim software off ebay some 3 months ago. The 2 are sold both as a package deal and separately by NI.

Anyways, just as the 3 months was up, the seller contacted NI's support and claimed his license had been stolen. He provided them with the proof of his transaction with them and they reverted the license ownership to his account. When I got the wind of it, I also contacted NI and while they don't strictly mind their hardware/software being sold second hand, they couldn't give the license back to me since they didn't facilitate the transaction(which they don't in general). 

Ok so the license is gone, whatever. What irks me though is that the guy is still selling the same package on ebay and hes got a glowing feedback score, couple thousand positive, no negative. I can't leave feedback anymore since its been 3 months and 5 days, ebay's customer service page just has me going in loops. As long as 3 months have passed, the seller is untouchable.

Ebay,"[Canada] First time seller, Unpaid item question","I realize unpaid item questions come up a lot and I read some other threads before posting this. Thanks for any help you can offer.

Here's the situation. I've bought lots of stuff on ebay but I've never sold anything before this. The auction ends and I send a message to the buyer thanking him and telling him it's ready to ship as soon as I receive payment. 24 hours later and I've had no response and no payment. I check the users feedback and despite several ""fast payment, great buyer"" etc I also see several ""no payment, didn't pay, no response, AVOID"" etc. I suspect this is going to be a non payment scenario. The only real reason this is a problem is that this particular item is high demand but it is a fluid market due to a replacement model being introduced very soon. The high demand for the item is only there because of long wait times for the new model and will likely dry up soon. So I want to get it back up for sale ASAP.

I know ebay's unpaid item claim starts after 4 days, do I have to wait that long before I relist the item?

If I can relist the item right away do I still have to open an unpaid item claim? Will I end up paying two selling fees? If I sell the item to someone else and the first person decides to pay what happens?

Anyways, Seller approved the refund request but then eBay sent me another message saying the seller cannot provide shipping label for refund but is still responsible for return shipping costs and contact them for details etc.

Then the seller private messages me through my inbox and posted an address that does not match the actual address described in the ""Return Details of the seller information"" and asks me to send it to that address instead.

Now seller inboxes me the California address but the actual address posted in the return request is the UK one. 

My questions are:

(1) Should I still proceed to go get the postage for the California one OR should I get the seller to change the return address to the California address first to make it official in case he scams me?

(2) Seller asks me to check how much return postage and then says he will send me return postage. Is it possible to get the exact fee without printing the label from the local post office? (my dumb question but just want to make sure)

(3) I got it shipped to the US (my current eBay address) but I actually live in Vancouver Canada and I just drove across the border to pick up the parcel (30 min drive) because the seller only ships to the US. Now, does it matter if I send it back from Vancouver or do i HAVE to send it back through the same US address that it was originally shipped to? Does it matter where I make the return from?

Ebay,"How to do you convert ""watchers"" into buyers?","I think I read in here or in the flippers subreddit about a few ways to entice ""watchers"" into buying your item.

I had a few other items that also had a few watchers on them but no one bought them. I now have another item that is up to 7 watchers but this is the second time I've listed it (first time had no watchers).

I was thinking next time on my fixed price listing I will click ""send to online auction"" after X amount of watchers on an item. But I heard that this sets the auction at .99 cents. Is this true, and can you revise it to to the original fixed price? 

I also have lowered the price a little bit on some items that have watchers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 

I think I remember reading about someone's strategy where they increase the price a little bit and that creates a little bit of a panic in people. But to me that seems like it would piss off the watchers.

Ebay,"Worried about a Paypal Chargeback? They happen, lets follow my most current one and see if I win.","So you wake up one morning, just like I did today and you open your email to a Paypal Chargeback. Oh shit you say. Those fuckers.

The email doesn't say anything besides the amount. So you need to dig a bit to find what item you're about to forego to the ever common ""cost of business"". 

For me it was a $75 item. Not the worst, but enough to warrant a fight. That is the day minimum if you want to support yourself in this fun game of eBay. If you're lucky.

You can upload proof pictures and tracking. Do that. There is a screenshot button on your keyboard, you may have to hold FN or Alt and then that button to get it. Take photos of the item listed in Shipping Labels (click the company you shipped with) to see the address you mailed it to. This way Paypal knows exactly where it went.

The buyer made a mistake and messaged me a few days ago, complaining about the item. Just one message and I ignored it. Wasn't worth conversing about. They said they won't leave me negative feedback (hurray) but wait! as it turns out they will be kind enough to take my items and my money.

Contact between you and the buyer is vital. It goes a long way and extracting information from them with or without their knowledge is important and a skill. In this case because they commented on the item and it shipped to their official Paypal address they already gave me plenty of information. Paypal should see this as an open and shut case. If they don't, I'm a big user of sending glitter bombs. The internal satisfaction soothes me.

Paypal chargebacks don't happen often. I've been at this for 3 years. I probably deal with 1 a year. 2 if I'm lucky.

Ebay,"New/old scam, fake tracking number","Seller listed item as shipped with ups tracking.  Ups lists shipment as delivered.  Ups tracking website only shows delivery city (correct) but no address.  I suspect seller found a valid delivered tracking number in my city and used it.  What the seller didnt count on is that I have video surveillance showing no ups driver any time during the supposed delivery day.  To be 100% sure I contacted UPS via chat and they confirmed that the shipment is addressed to some other address and a different name.  Ofcourse they wouldn't provide proof but I got screen shots of the convo.  Now waiting on ebays resolution delay to contact ebay.  Since order, seller has 2 new neg feedbacks about scams.  Account has low feedback, I forgot to check -- my fault.

Edit3: The ebay time delay expired and ofcourse the seller never replied or provided tracking proof showing my address and name.  I requested ebay to resolve the matter and 5 minutes later they sided with me.  But it's clear they didnt even read the case because they're asking me to return the item and provide the tracking number!   Now what?!

I tried this link maby times over the course of 6 hours on different computers and network connections.  So then I finally gave up and called ebay.  They're telling me that the error message is because the seller is no longer registered.  The CS person chastised me for filing an INAD when it should have been an INR.  I explained to her that the website would not allow me to file an INR because the seller used a fake tracking number that tricked the website into thinking the item was delivered.  She responded that she's only trying to help me get my refund (I got the impression here she still thinks I did something wrong doesn't understand what I just explained).  The CS escalated the call and the new CS said the seller's account was actually suspended due to my transaction.  After reviewing, he agreed to send me a paypal refund in 24-48hrs.  I'm confident that if I didn't call, this case would be in limbo and nothing would have happened until the expiration of the protection and then I'd be SOL.

Ebay,shipping label system glitches,"IN the past couple of weeks I've run across a couple of issues in the ebay/paypal shipping label system that I have not encountered prior.

I print labels in my ebay ---&gt; selling ---&gt; sold ---&gt; awaiting shipment then ""print shipping label"" beside each item. This takes me to the paypal shipping page. Most of my items are set up to ship by USPS by default with UPS as an option. 

1) When I would click ""print shipping label"" on ebay for an item sold for USPS shipment, it used to take me to the paypal shipping page. Recently it started taking me to a new, different, ""beta"" shipping page on paypal. I noticed when using this ""beta"" shipping page, even if it is for an ebay item, USPS priority shipping only shows with $50 insurance instead of the $100 that it should be. 

2) ON that same ""beta"" shipping page on paypal's site, there is an option to ""use the classic shipping label experience instead"". When I click that it will take me to the page where you select whether you want to use UPS or USPS. Selecting USPS only takes you right back to the same ""beta"" page you just left. Selecting UPS takes you to the ""old"" UPS shipping page in paypal.

3) Sometimes if the ebay system collected a high shipping cost from the buyer for whichever default service was listed on that item, I will compare costs for other services to see if I can save them some money. So for instance if they buy a UPS item and it charges them $40, I will check the USPS rates for priority and parcel post to see if those are any better. I usually do this in two separate windows, starting both from the ebay ""sold"" item tab and following ""print shipping label"" from there then selecting the carrier I want to get rates for. So say I open a new window for the above sale and check the USPS rate and it turns out to be $55 which is obviously not better than the $40 UPS rate given in the other window. 

I close the USPS window entirely. My UPS shipping page window is still open and I proceed with creating the label there. Ordinarily this would charge you the $40 UPS rate and give you a UPS label. Recently this no longer works...it *says* it is charging you the UPS rate, but when you click ""purchase"" it gives you a USPS label at the higher USPS rate. But if you look on the shipping label confirmation page it still shows that it charged you the lower UPS rate, along with a USPS tracking number. 

This has happened to me twice in the past week, once costing me $20 and once more costing me $7. I guess to avoid this I am going to have to make a habit of closing both shipping cost windows and starting the process from scratch once more to ensure I get the service and label I'm expecting to pay for.",1,2,2016-03-30,EBAY,0.05207769572734833,0.9071911573410034,0.040731124579906464
Ebay,Neutral feedback removed,"I received a neutral FB this morning from a buyer.  Stated ""Kinda rude. Bad communication. Arrived on time, though""  My account is 100% positive, BTW.

This was on a order that was done as a BIN, after I declined a few low offers. The thing is, there were no messages between the buyer an I. 

I know the NFB doesn't affect anything, but it bothered me because it was just untrue. So I called eBay.

First Rep says that it can't be removed because I may have had communication outside of eBay with the buyer. WHAT? eBay doesn't recognize any outside communication for any other reason, now they will assume there may have been some outside communication and use that to justify NFB? 

So I asked for a supervisor. The rep actually tried to talk me out of speaking to a sup, which was strange. Anyhow, spoke to a supervisor and got the feedback removed. I simply argued that since there were no messages between the buyer and myself, it wasn't possible for me to be considered rude. And since there were no attempts by the buyer to communicate, it was possible for me to have had ""bad communications"" with him.

Ebay,"Sold a car on eBay, but the same day it broke down. What to do?","So, I sold a 2014 Mustang on eBay this week. Car ran great, was in great condition, and I was happy to sell it. I was driving it home the day of the auction close with the intention of washing it up for the buyer, and apparently at some point I hit something and tore the bottom out of the oil pan. Not knowing that this had happened (how I didn't hear it is beyond me, but whatever), the motor ran low on oil and essentially destroyed 3 of the 6 cylinders in a matter of moments. This all happened before the auction ended, but I was not aware of the severity of the situation until the next day when it was light out and I could really look at things. 

I immediately contacted the buyer and let them know what was going on. I've been working on the car since, but it's come down to the fact that it's going to need a new motor and I don't have the money to replace it right now. The buyer is being cooperative but is understandably frustrated, and I don't have a car for him to come pick up.

My question is this: what options do I have as the seller to reach a peaceful resolution? I understand that Motors sales are not binding, but that I can't cancel on the basis of seller remorse. That's certainly not the case here, but how will they view it? I'm doing my best to placate the buyer, but I can't say that it's going all that well.

He is currently refusing to come to any sort of deal with me and insists that it is not his responsibility as he sent the photos of the labels after I had put my bid in. Sorry if this worded badly, But I'm currently feeling like I have just thrown $100 down the drain :(. Any help is appreciated greatly.

TLDR: Bought item, questioned its authenticity, turns out to be fake, seller wont refund.",5,4,2016-03-31,EBAY,0.15670524537563324,0.8048548698425293,0.03843988478183746
Ebay,Is this a scam?,"I won an auction on eBay. Paid through PayPal. Nothing new. Then I get a message from seller: blah blah out of town blah blah can't send package until Thursday blah. Ok. Next I get a message saying more delays, family death. Then I get my purchase refunded. They now say they will sell me it for less than original price after they get back. This sounds like it could be the start of a scam. But let say it isn't is there a way to complete this transaction and still be protected. Ideas?",6,3,2016-03-31,EBAY,0.05542808026075363,0.9123567938804626,0.032215166836977005
Ebay,"Believe I'm being scammed as a seller, more inside....","...So I listed a new Galaxy S7 that was pre-ordered and bundled with a GearVR and 64GB SD card(I threw in a case as well that I didn't like). That item sold for $796. Buyer took almost 9 days to show as paid in PayPal, saying he was having troubles getting PayPal set up, yada yada. So finally the item was paid for with an eCheck.

I ship the item the same day the payment cleared like the good guy that I am. When the buyer received the item, I immediately get a message saying the box looked like it had been opened and was missing the SD card, headphones(which are inside the cell phone box) and the case.

So to resolve this, I've offered a replacement SD card, headphones, and case out of my pocket. The buyer sent a message back asking if these were the originals and I responded yes with a picture I took of the SD, headphones, and case. i told him I wouldn't ship them until he cancelled the return. Now the money has already come out of my PayPal for the return, and he still hasn't responded about the replacement items.

I've talked to eBay, they said I'm doing the right things so far by offering replacements, but what if I'm forced to take this return with missing components and a now used S7 and GearVR.

What should I do? I'm feeling like I'm getting duped here. What do you guys think?",4,3,2016-03-31,EBAY,0.046760931611061096,0.9131227731704712,0.04011627286672592
Ebay,Had to return an item. Used ebay to print shipping label. I have the label # but not tracking number. What do I enter?,Ebay asks you to enter the tracking number to receive a refund but I only have the label number. Its been a day sense I dropped the package off and the label number shows up nothing in USPS tracking. What do I do?,5,3,2016-03-31,EBAY,0.1214260458946228,0.858993649482727,0.019580354914069176
Ebay,What kind of scam is this?,"I received an order on Friday for a pair of shoes, NIB, that I prepared on Sunday, then shipped on Monday. Today I get a facebook post and a private message from the buyer stating:

""Hello, I purchased the xxx shoes from you on Ebay and received them today.  Right after I gave you a glowing review, I realized that you sent me a size 5 shoe when you had it advertised on Ebay as being size 6.  The box says size 6, but the shoes inside are size 5.  They are useless to me since they are too small.  I feel you should refund me the money and pay the return cost for me to return them to you.  Your thoughts?""

I know for a fact that the shoes inside were size 6. I double checked the sizes of both shoes, and re-packed them nicely in the box on Sunday with taped business card saying ""Thanks"" to the tissue. On Monday I checked again at the PO when I picked up a Priority Mail shoe box because I had run out.

The buyer gave me feedback on eBay that said ""Love! Perfect! Just as described and pictured. SUPER fast shipping too! Thanks!!"" 

The buyer has NOT sent me a message or return request via eBay and I'm hesitant to talk order-related concerns via Facebook being how anal eBay is about all communication being via eBay.

Thoughts? What should I do?",14,2,2016-03-31,EBAY,0.026565104722976685,0.9277619123458862,0.0456729531288147
Ebay,Charged $50 postage for a $30 watch,"Yesterday I won an auction for a watch for $30 CAD. I tried to calculate postage on the page before I bid, but when I entered my address as being in the US and my zip code in Illinois, it said ""Shipping cost cannot be calculated. Please enter a valid ZIP Code.""

I didn't really worry about it, as I assumed it wouldn't cost too much to ship, and the price I paid is fairly cheap anyway.

But after getting confirmation that I won the auction, I have been charged $50 CAD for postage.

Is this too much? And if so, is it reasonable to contact the seller or eBay to get a reduced shipping cost? I have not yet paid for the item.",2,2,2016-03-31,EBAY,0.06779580563306808,0.8881505727767944,0.044053591787815094
