Ebay,Seller wants me to rescend Nuetral Feedback,"I bought an item that I frequently buy from Ebay, usually from within my own state several times a month. I use these for parts to make repairs for my customers.  I bought one a few weeks ago and my invoive showed $5 more for shipping than usuall, and I paid more for this item by about $10 than I usually do. I contacted seler  about shipping fee and he told me I was welcome not to buy item if I did not like his fee. He also pointed out where I had charged simialr fee to ship one of my items- though he did not know mine was twice as big and I shipped mine to Hawaii and I ate $3 on that one. Basically he was not cool. I had no time to try to wait for another to be listed, these are not that common, so I had to buy it.  He waited two days to ship.  So when item arrived I left him five stars for everything except for shipping, and left it as neutral due to his attitude and gouging me on shiiping. 

He sent me message today asking me to rescind my feedback because he felt he was fair by telling me I did not have to buy it.  I let him know that practices such as his is why we have to pay Final-Value fees on shipping now, and I gave him opportunity to charge fair shipping just as he gave me opportunity not to buy. I was up against the clock and had to take the item. 

I do not think I was out of line here- but i'd like to hear what you guys think.  In all my years and thousands of transactions on ebay I've only left negative feedback twice- this was first neutral.",17,0,2012-11-01,EBAY,0.04298659786581993,0.9133443832397461,0.04366902634501457

Ebay,"need desperate help, possible lawsuit","This is a TL;DR. I tried my best to summarize.

The buyer won the bid on my iPhone for 1,000 dollars, he paid me on Paypal, I then shipped the item to his Ebay address like I am supposed to as an Ebay seller, I have the tracking information to prove this. The buyer then filed a dispute with Paypal (unauthorized transaction) and won that dispute. So, as the item is on its way to the buyer (can not intercept international shipments), I am still without money. Clearly an orchestrated scam by the buyer, Paypal told me that the buyer had stolen the Paypal he paid me with, therefore the real Paypal account was awarded the dispute, however Paypal would NOT cover me because I shipped it to the buyers Ebay shipping rather than his Paypal shipping, so Paypal told me to contact Ebay, they are liable and can cover me with seller protection because I did ship it to the correct Ebay address.

Now Ebay is telling me since the buyer chose to not check out through Ebay, but rather send it directly through Paypal, he voided by coverage even though it was out of my control. Last week Ebay told me to call back when it was shipped and they would cover me (after 8 phone calls of explaining my situation and pestering them for a week), now they are going back to their original standpoint that they are not liable.

What do I do? Isn't there any lawsuit when a representative of Ebay says something and does not follow through? I have no clue what to do and 1,000 dollars is a lot of money to me.

Ebay,A buyer with only 4 (positive) feedback and a Nigerian name has bought my item. Should I be wary of a possible scam?,"I recently put my cellphone up for sale for $468. It was bought by a buyer claiming to be in Louisiana, however, their name is Nigerian and there are several Facebook pages with that name. The only ones claiming to live in the U.S. is one from the specific city in Louisiana the buyer is claiming to be from. However, the several accounts with that name (all having different pictures and friends) seems suspicious. This whole thing seems suspicious, the buyer even claims to know British English, American English, Nigerian Pidgin and Igbo, despite only looking like a college kid. Another thing is, they did not pay immediately and I had to send them an invoice (which they still haven't paid, but it's only been a few hours). Strangely, the account is using relatively correct English and not the awful copy-paste English that most scammers use. 

I realized the risk of a scam before putting the item up for sale, so I made it very clear that Paypal is the only accepted form of payment and that I will only ship to the address listed by the buyer when they buy the item. However, I am worried about being scammed by this user  (they've been on eBay since March 2012, but they only have four feedback, with 3 of them not having information available due to the age of the sell and 1 of them being listed as ""Private"".) In addition, I looked up their address in Google Maps and there doesn't seem to be an apartment complex any where near that area (the address had ""Apt 10 in it). Should I wait for the seller to respond to the invoice and the message I sent them? 

How can I protect myself against the possible scam? If it becomes apparent that it is a scam, how would I go about cancelling the sale without receiving negative feedback and having my history ruined (I only have 38 positive feedback, so a negative one would ruin me.)?",3,0,2012-11-03,EBAY,0.04894421249628067,0.9191610813140869,0.03189462423324585

Ebay,[POSSIBLE SCAM] How should I handle this situation?,"After sending an invoice to the buyer and receiving nothing, I let the buyer know (through eBay messages) that an unpaid item case would be automatically opened if payment wasn't received after four days.

I hace tried my best you might probably have to cancel this transaction. Thanks."" .

 I clearly stated in the item description (as well as my MyWorld page) that I only accepted Paypal. I am afraid to cancel the transaction because that would leave me vulnerable to negative feedback. Should I just let eBay open the UPI? I am also afraid to do this because if the scammer does decide to pay, it would leave me vulnerable to a SNAD/empty envelope scam.

anyway... here's the thing... i said id give him a full refund as soon as he sent me a picture to show that it was broken. he agreed to do so, then later sent me a message indicating that he had a picture. it seemed like there was a failed attachment or something, but there was no picture. (his message was something along the lines of: ""here you go, this is the best picture i could get"" but there was no picture)

now the case will get escalated to ebay customer support in a few days, and if they pay him to ship it back, then charge me, im rather screwed since i don't have a job anymore, hardly enough money to survive long enough to get another, and nothing left to sell. unfortunately its a rather heavy item that's expensive to ship... it cost over $30 to get it there sending it by the cheapest possible method, but from what ive heard, ebay would pay to have it sent back first class.

A few minutes later, it sold out, so clearly I jumped on it just in time! I was ecstatic.

Then I did some investigation. It wasn't just a good deal; this is about 20% of retail price. The seller has great reputation, but it all seems to be reviews of handbags and other fashion items, not electronics. Another Redditor said that the seller had a bunch of listings, and then most of them were removed. Several other listings have similarly too-good-to-be-true priced electronics.

Ebay,Idea for item not received problems,"I didn't want to suggest this directly to ebay because I assume they will just not listen or it will get sent to a low level employee and then they just won't be able to do anything.

Item not received is a pretty big problem for businesses selling small value items. I understand it will happen sometimes but I think it's literally around 3-4% off the top of my head for me personally, possibly higher but I havn't counted through my records. Over thousands of sales I think this is a high enough sample size to say that some people are cheating the system.

So my thoughts are have a small thing either in or separate to the resolution centre so that cases are not involved and do it like this.
The basics behind this idea is that for items which go ""missing"" the process is put out in the open for ebay to see rather than just communication between the buyer and the seller. I don't want to take this away of course, just alter it.

Buyer must click ""item not received"" button after a reasonable period of time if they want a replacement/refund. (But mostly replacement because I think these go largely unchecked and unchallenged).

This alerts the seller and then the seller decides what to do next, for example sending out a replacement.

The buyer gets a discrete mark of item not received on their accounts visible only by ebay. If a buyer gets above a certain percentage such as 15% over 20 transactions then their account address will be suspended or banned.

Honestly I think this is so simple to create and would help small value item sellers so much.",4,5,2012-11-08,EBAY,0.057471174746751785,0.9129770994186401,0.02955169603228569

Ebay,I bought a new smartphone. An obviously used phone was delivered. Issues getting a refund. Help?,"About a month ago there was an BIN listing for a NEW Samsung Illusion phone. I bought it for $89.99. A few days later an obviously used phone arrived at my home. The phone screen had several dozen light scratches on it. It looked like the phone had been in someone's pocket for an extended length of time and possibly got scratched from contact with their keys.

So I contacted the seller and was like ""WTF."" He didn't acknowledge that he sent a used phone but he agreed for me to return the phone for a full refund.

I sent the phone via USPS on 10/16. I neglected to purchase a tracking number for the phone, so there's no tracking available for the package.

Weeks later, he still hasn't sent a refund or even acknowledged ever receiving the phone. I then escalate to eBay Resolution Center.

I go back and forth with eBay Resolution Center a few times and they insist that I must have a tracking number. Otherwise they can't offer a refund. They completely negated the fact that this seller has had several other customers complaining about the same thing as I am complaining about. eBay also ignored the fact that the seller was completely silent during the resolution process.

2 days ago, eBay made a final decision to not give me my refund. They seem pretty firm on that decision.

I tried calling the seller a few times. Apparently they have a business. I talked to several people that promised to send a refund but they didn't follow through with that promise.

What the hell should I do now? Should I contact Paypal? Or my bank? This was purchased via eBay/Paypal on a Chase checking account so I am not sure if I have any credit card protetion. The only thing I have to prove that I sent the phone was my USPS receipt which listed the seller's city, state but no street address.

They buy the item via buy it now, and I send an invoice because I did not receive payment (despite the fact that they said they would pay immediately.

All communication stopped (it was near-instant before) and after some searching around, I found that their address was not valid on Google maps (though a close variant is) and that they're on two bad buyer lists.

Ebay,Recent sales not showing up in BlackThorne Pro...,"I have just started using BlackThorne Pro last week to make handling our large inventory (200 to 500 items) easier but instead its creating a bigger headache.

At the moment I have roughly 250 unsold items in my inventory that have listings created for them.  Blackthorne is showing us we have +600.  Many are duplicates.  How can I get my inventory to only show active listings and have items marked that have been sold?

Also, today I went to check our sales over the weekend in the Monitory Tab and its only showing 11 items from about two weeks back.  Some of the items were sold several months back.  I'm missing almost 20 items that have sold in the last week.

The software seems like it could be really useful but at the moment Turbo Lister is starting to look like the better alternative but it has a ton of problems on its own.  Which was why I switched to BlackThorne in the first place.

Does anyone have any suggestions, guides, or ideas for handling large amount of listings, inventory, properly re-listing unsold items, and have items removed from my inventory automatically after its been sold?

Ebay,Ebays claims system is ridiculous.,"I have two open cases that are taking what seems like forever to resolve.
One was opened through paypal over two weeks ago. I provided Paypal with the correspondence i had with the buyer over ebay where she agreed to keep the item in return for a $14 refund. For some reason it is taking Paypal weeks to resolve this seemingly open and closed case.

The second case i have open was from a buyer who received a lot of used games from me and wanted to return them because he said they were badly scratched and unplayable. The same day he opened his case i responded and offered him a full refund. A week later and negative feedback left he didn't reply. Then when i escalated my claim, magically 8 hours later he bought shipping and Ebay decided in his favor. 3 days later he has yet to ship it. I know this because the UPS tracking says only the billing information has been received.  

I know that the whole Ebay is buyer friendly thing is some what exaggerated but i can't he;p but feel like i am being shafted a bit here. For Christ sake i have $137.00 sitting in paypal purgatory. You would think that their claims system would have a time table.

Ebay,Nigerian Scam,"I though I should share my scam story with you.

Couple of days ago, I ordered The Beatles Remastered Boxset for a good price of £110 (175$) instead of retail price of £175 (270$) and up. 

I was so happy that I decided to check what else the guy is offering and there were two other items - a flock of Brazilian hair and Dr. Dre Beats Studio headphones for the same price as the boxset. I thought, ""WOW"", and immediately both the headset. 

Today, my stuff arrived and as I discovered, they both were counterfeit. The Beatles Boxset, for example, could be bought for only 16$ in China. Since it was a present, I can't just give these to my audiophile dad.  

So, I messaged the guy saying that he has two options - a full refund, or I will report his ass to every single institution for copyright infringement and bootlegging. 

Now, the important part, his eBay username was a westernized full name, but on Paypal my money went to someone with Nigerian last name (did a little search on Facebook and almost all guys with same first name and last name were from THAT corner of Africa.)

I just came back from work and see ur letter with every tiredness of work. i feel sory for every inconvenience caused. but to be frank, i thought, you should be saying thank you.

Email was caught in spam filter and I didnt know I had a resolution balance and eventually a hold on my account. When I found out I paid immediately on Nov. 6th. The Hold is still on my account as od Nov. 15th. I have spent literally 8-9 HOURS on the phone with eBay CSRs, all of which seem to be ridiculously inept. They all tell me the same thing ... ""Yes, you have 0.00 balance, hold should be released days ago, Ill process hold release which will release hold within 24 hours."" Twenty-four hours rolls around, and no release. I have spoken with Trust &amp; Safety, Resolutions Department, Billing, etc. I even had a supposed Supervisor ""guarantee"" me that the account would be released by tomorrow morning. Instead, she sends me an email tonight stating that I own them 50.00 ... which she ALREADY had verified had been paid. Frankly, I am completely irate over this and if I hear ""wait 24 hours"" again Im going to snap. I have several thousand dollars worth of product sitting here waiting to be listed and Im losing cash by the day. Can anyone here give me some advice?

Ebay,"Buyer left negative feedback for a perfect item, what can i do?","a buyer left me a negative feedback today, my first one ever. the item in question was a hand blown glass basket, on the handle there was a sharp edge from when it was attached. i took good pictures and described it in the listing.

the buyer sent me a message saying that they got the item - it was as described but they feel that the sharp edge on the side is damage. i told her she could return it although the listing did say no returns. she didnt even respond to me and just left negative feedback. 

i sent a feedback revision request but is there anything else i can do? i dont feel i am in the wrong here and my 100% positive is now a 99.3%

Ebay,Buyer wants to change shipping address after they paid... What do I do to stay protected?,"I'm pretty new as a seller on eBay.  I've just sold an item.  The buyer paid right away, but then followed up with an email saying that they forgot to change their address in Paypal after they moved and they asked if I could ship it to their correct address.  

Now I know this can sometimes mean scam, and I want to protect myself.  And from what I gather, I need to give the buyer a refund, and then somehow sell it back to them once they've changed their address in Paypal.  Problem is, I have no idea what the process would be for me to do this.  Can someone walk me through the steps so I don't sound like an idiot in my reply to the buyer or screw this up really badly?

Ebay,Warning to those buying jerseys on eBay (spoiler: the fakes look INCREDIBLE!) ... album attached,"I purchased a Nike Elite jersey from an online store in China.  It came packaged and ready to re-sell.  I was amazed by the quality and appearance of it.  The tags were spot-on and the stitching was well done.   Words and numbers were straight.  The product tag even had a hologram logo.   The inside of the jersey said ""Made in Honduras of U.S.A. fabric"".

I will say that with the stitching, where the thread ends, there are a few that stick out, but can easily be clipped with fingernail clippers.

The kicker is that I bought 3 of them for $115.

So be cautious when buying from eBay.  If you purchased a $250 Nike Elite jersey for $100 and thought you got a deal of a lifetime, think again.   You probably bought a fake and paid triple for what it's worth.

I messaged him asking if he was still able to buy my phone but he never responded. So i decided to do some research on his account and i discovered that he buys about 8-10 cell phones a week. I just opened an Unpaid Item claim about an hour ago. Is there anything else i can/need to do? This is my first time selling on eBay and I just want to know how to fix this.

Ebay,Did I handle this correctly?,"So I had a customer ask me a question about a listing. They asked me if I had a similar item. I did, and I hadn't listed it yet but planned to later that evening. They asked how much I wanted for both (the listed item + unlisted item) and if I had a third item. I did have the third item.

I told them how much it was for the unlisted items and asked them to buy the listed one and I would send an invoice through PayPal for the other two and send them all in the same package. 

I figured since their interest was sparked by the listing, I'd have to pay the relevant fees with it like the listing fee, PayPal fee and Buy It Now fee.

Do I also owe eBay the fees for the unlisted items? Or is that considered a separate transaction? In the PayPal invoice I listed it as a ""Goods/Services"" transaction rather than gift. 

All contact between customer and myself was through eBay's message system if that's relevant.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/OGlHh.jpg) is the list with bids where I highlighted some stuff that I don't quite understand.

1) For example t***c(8). If he really wanted the keyboard, why did he put in his bid that early? He should have known that someone would wait until it's almost over (the guy who won bid 4 seconds before closing).

2) Why does the $50 bid show up two times but for different people?

3) And what exactly was the function of those low-feedback bids that occured in short intervals?

Were those automated? If they were bidding against each other shouldn't the list be like ""ababab"" instead of ""aaabbb""?

Or was it just the seller himself who used those accounts the push the price?

Ebay,Paypal's annual holiday cash grab,"I'm a full time online seller.  Ah good ole Paypal, a true friend. They just informed me that my account was 'randomly' selected for a security review. They asked me to change my password and then said they want to confirm physical location. They are mailing me a confirmation code that will arrive in 7-9 business days, which means 2 weeks. During thus time my account is limited so I can't cash out but can continue to receive money into the account. So they are holding everything that came in on Black Friday and everything that will come in on Cyber Monday and two prime holiday shopping weeks. This isn't the first time they have done this to me. It is why I do less than 5% of my business thru them when in the past it was over 95%. A little holiday cheer, Paypal style.

Two years ago they held over $40k of my money for an unknown time, for no good reason, that they finally released about a month later.  They can look at historical trends on my account and expect the same sales to be coming.  On Wednesday I did nearly $5k in sales which probably got them salivating.

Ebay,Proof of Ebay bullshit with screenshots to prove i am not insane or one sided.,"I sold a lot of 19 xbox games to the buyer.

The day the buyer receives said games, contacts me ans tells me the games are to scratched to play and one is even unplayable. Demands a 50% refund or else he'll return the games.

I don't want to get negative feedback so i tell him i'll accept his return. 

He opens a case against me and says i have been unhelpful. 

I accepted his return in the case. I wait for him to accept it. This occurred on November 5th.

Two Days later he leave me negative feedback.

A week has passed i escalate the claim to ebay. I told them the buyer has had a week to return the games and hasn't made the effort. 

Ebay finds in his favor and buys him return shipping. This is now November 12th. 

Call ebay on the 15th and ask they close the case since it has been 10 days.

Ebay tells me the buyer has 10 days from when ebay found in his favor to return it. 

It is now November 21st, Black Friday deals are starting up. Go to buy a $60 Nook Color for my mother. My Paypal account is blocked because i have had a negative balance for over two weeks now. This is now 16 days since the case has been open and my money has been frozen.

It is now Thursday the 22nd, the case should be closed now since it has been 10 days since Ebay found in the buyers favor. The case should be automatically closed. But nope, it is still open. I miss out on another black friday deal, a $35 12 month xbox live card.

So it is now November 23rd and the case still hasn't been closed. I call Ebay and ask for the case to be closed since it has been 11 days since ebay found in his favor and  18 days since i agreed to accept his return. Ebay promptly closes the case and i finally get my money after 18 days in paypal hell.

I call up ebay again to get the negative feedback revoked. I tell them that the buyer demanded a partial refund and the feedback should be removed based on that. They tell me there is nothing they can do. But they escalate me to a ""supervisor"" and the supervisor told me word for word what i was already told.

TLDR - Guy opens a case against me and i have my money frozen by ebay for almost three weeks. The guy never returns the item and i am now left with negative feedback and the guy faces no punishment despite his case blocking my payment for so long.

Ebay,New Scam?  Trying to get absent-minded seller to ship to wrong ebay member?,"I've been out of the ebay/amazon/craigslist peddling for a few years, but I sold a guitar recently and had some very strange activity.  Was wondering if it's some scam attempt or just a series of weird events (unlikely).

I sold this:  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=300814591005&amp;ssPageName=ADME:X:RTQ:US:1123

During the auction an ebayer asked me to quote 2-day shipping to California which was incredibly expensive (from Massachusetts for a $250 guitar).  I did.  He insisted it NEEDED to be delivered by the 23rd.  This ebayer never even bid on the auction.  Somebody else wins, but just today I got an email from the California guy asking for his tracking number and my cell phone number.  Oddly enough, in the bottom of his email address there's a little auction summary with closing time/date and the picture of the guitar, and it shows him as the winner.  THIS IS WEIRD, since again, he didn't enter a single bid.  Then I look at his profile and he's got a long, positive feedback history (100% over ~8years) but he's in the UK and is an ebay.uk member.

My guess is it's an attempt to get me to say ""oh shit, he needs it fast"" to get me to ship it to him instead of the buyer?  Even then, it would go to the address in California while it appears he's in the UK.  On top of that, an 8 year old scam account?  REALLY?  But it couldn't be just an accident as his email shows him as the winner when he clearly never even bid.

UPDATE:  Sent a message to ebay, they said call so I will when I get back to civilization tomorrow.  Looking at the guy's history he's been buying musical equipment for the last few weeks.  The only suspicious thing I didn't notice before is that in either email he never mentions and specifics.  He just says ""the item"".

Ebay,So FED UP with eBay... anybody know any good alternatives?,"I was an Ebay Top-Rated Seller for several months, I had a lot of positive feedback and the inevitable few negatives (around 0.50%). In the last 12 months I've had 3 negative feedbacks. 

1. Sold a used phone in ""fair"" condition, took clear pictures. Buyer claimed ""phone was not in good condition."" Never contacted me, never replied to my messages

2. Sold a used phone. Wrote in the listing that the item did NOT include a SIM. Wrote this 4 times in varying large fonts. The buyer wanted a return because he thought the item would come with a SIM card. I accepted his return, but charged him restocking fee. He left me negative for the restocking fee. 

3. Sold a new phone. Buyer claimed there were ""scratches"" on the back of the phone. I purchased the phone directly from AT&amp;T. Never contacted me, never replied to my messages.

Now you can argue whether these 3 negatives were somewhat my fault or not, but that is not my point. My point is I have thousands of transactions that went fine but the buyer did not leave feedback, and I have hundreds of transactions where the buyer was very happy and left me positives. But because of these 3, I have dropped from ""Top-Rated Seller"" to ""Above Standard"" to ""Below Standard."" That's right, I am now below standard. I have 6 units of iPhone 5 sitting in my closet and I can't sell them because eBay places listing restrictions on ""below standard sellers."" 

My entire small business is effectively frozen until my ""next evaluation"" on the 20th of December, which apparently cannot be moved up. I am so sick of eBay's ridiculous policies. The cutoff for below standard is 1.00% or above. I have exactly 1.01% and I've called 3 different eBay reps and all of them have basically told me there was nothing they could do. 
I have never been late with eBay seller fees and I've paid them an average of $1000-1500 a month in seller fees, and because of this stupid policy I basically cannot sell any iPhones on eBay for an entire month. 

I never want to sell on this horrible site again. All I wanted from them was to be able to list iPhones, but they are telling me I can list one iPhone every 7 days.

Ebay,Strange Item Not As Described request.,"Just a small question, a buyer purchased a single item from me and sent me this message after receiving it,

""
Hi I've received the exfoliater. However I am very unhappy with the packing. It was squeezed into some plastic polythene. The item was not protected at the top end, nor was there any space between the flimsy polythene packing and the product. Whilst trying to open one end of the package with scissors, this has caused cut into the tip of the item, the tube is now damaged and leaking the product. Unless you can provide me with a replacement immediately, I would like a full refund of the item as the packaging was inadequate and did not protect the item. I would like an immediate response as I due to go abroad next week. Thank you.""

The Exfoliator was placed in a silver opaque polythene bag, slightly stretched so that it would fit, with bubble wrap placed around the plastic end of the bottle 2x layered so that the lid wouldn't break what with it being plastic. The thick plastic top end had no protection on it as I thought it'd be pretty impossible to break the item at that end anyway.

From what hes saying he opened the bag with scissors and cut the item causing it to leak, I'm probably going to send him a replacement anyway as its not worth risking a negative over roughly £3.00 but I was wondering where the liability stands on this?",11,3,2012-11-26,EBAY,0.09047916531562805,0.8789837956428528,0.030537070706486702
Ebay,Question for those of you that have sold a gift card before.,"Hi everyone, I just sold a gift card on EBay (it actually sold for more than face value which is what has me a little concerned)

The user payed immediately and requested for me to send him the code so he can use it on Cyber Monday.  I don't want to scratch the code, but I understand not wanting to miss out on any deals.  (My auction was for the card, not the code)

Is there a way I can get screwed out of the card if I send it to him digitally and ship it out tomorrow? Am I going to get in trouble for declining to send the code?  It's just a decent amount of money and I'd hate to somehow get in a paypal struggle if he claimed he never received it.

Ebay,Afraid I am being scammed.. weird situation,"I am fairly new to selling items on Ebay and am having a weird situation with a buyer.

The buyer purchased an item that was obviously bid higher by worthless accounts, although the buyer's account was not the same that caused the item to go higher.  The buyer's account is less than a few months old, and only has one customer feedback (also not from the account that bid the item higher). This one feedback is positive.

The buyer then pays me through PayPal. I check the address tied to the PayPal account and it matches that of the Ebay account.

I then get an email from a personal gmail account with a name extremely similar to that of the buyer. This email is obviously meant to resemble a PayPal payment verification email, but there are noticeable differences from ones I had previously received.

Ebay,My dad has an antique stove cover with (what he believes) an image of the virgin Mary burnt into it. He wants to sell it. Where do I even start?!,"He's held onto it for almost 30 years, but has fallen on hard times and hears stories about religious iconography being sold on ebay and such (the famous grilled cheese sandwhich and such).

Ebay,"Account used by someone else, now suspended for threatening messages","I'm posting this for my friend in the hopes that I can find advice for him. His account has been used by someone else to make a purchase and during the process the other person apparently sent threatening messages to the seller. I say apparently because now the account is suspended and the messages apparently have been deleted. The notice from eBay was 
&gt;MC023 INV NOTICE: eBay Registration Suspension - User to User Threats -

The transaction in question was for a $3.00 notepad with some cute design, something that my friend would never have purchased in the first place. He has a decent history of buying items like jeans and electronics. Also had a good reputation as seller and buyer up until now. 

My friend does know the person who used his account, they have had a relationship on and off over the years, but there is no way that person will own up to this and do anything to make it right.

eBay's position is that there is no recourse, from the message they sent: 
&gt;We regret to inform you that your eBay account has been suspended, because it has violated our member-to-member contact policy.
&gt;
&gt;Because of this account suspension, you're not allowed to use eBay in any way. This includes registering a new account or using another existing account. If you owe any fees, eBay will charge them to your current billing method.

I don't know much about eBay myself but I wanted to at least try to get some help, this doesn't make sense that there is no precedent or procedure for a situation like this.

(BTW, this really is about a friends account. My own eBay account user name is tubeguy69, if anyone wants to see.)

Ebay,No way to remove neutral feedback after expired feedback revision request... Buyer wants to change it.,"Background story; had a buyer purchase an item and leave neutral feedback (screen protector, they touched the sticky side and it didn't stick well). Sent them replacements, and they asked for us to send a feedback revision request. We sent it, but never got a response. The request ultimately expired.

Now the buyer wrote to us asking us to send the revision request, stating that they never received it. Since we can't re-send a request, I figured a simple call to eBay would fix things up.

Wrong.

Got on the phone, representative says ""well our policy doesn't allow us to change it"". But... the buyer wants to change it... Still no. Apparently it's a one-shot deal and the representatives have no ability to change it. Asked about any workarounds, but still, nothing.

**ORIGINAL**

 
**All images are of the actual item being sold, not a stand-in!**

The Eagle 38053 microscope is the companies best-selling model. Notable features include the three lenses with magnifications of 4x, 10x, and 40x, a smooth-gliding 360 degree rotating head, and user-replaceable incandescent lightbulb in base. Microscope is made out of durable metal and plastic components. 

This microscope is in good working order with two instances of minor cosmetic damage: the plastic cord holder on the back of the unit has been sheared off. This does not effect the operation of the unit any way. Additionally, a thin wire around the inside of the eyepiece had come loose and was viewable when looking through the eyepiece. The wire was removed with a Leatherman and operation does not seem to be affected at all. This microscope was very lightly used as a homeschooling aid. The microscope was used less than 20 times. The microscope has never been treated roughly (the sheared off plastic piece non-withstanding.. It is unknown how the damage occurred). The owner is a photographer so the lens optics have been well cared for.

Included with the microscope is a plastic dust-cover. It is discolored, but clean. Be aware that the microscope does NOT come with anything else.

Ebay,First time eBay'r. Need tips on selling used items,I am selling a used laptop that's in great condition and is only a year old but I'm unsure of what price to sell it at. Is there any sort of guide or formula to go off of?,1,1,2012-11-30,EBAY,0.012622229754924774,0.8715192675590515,0.11585851013660431
Ebay,Ordered an item that turned out to be defective.... do I pay return shipping for replacement?,"I ordered a phone off ebay that came from US, I am in Canada.  The seller described it as fully functional, however, the phone cannot receive phone calls or text messages.  It CAN send them.  So I contacted the seller and he said it's still under warranty so he will replace it from manufacturer (Motorola), so can I request that he pay for return shipping?  I understand I am responsible for customs/duties, but it seems silly that I would be responsible for paying return shipping for a defective item that he advertised as 'fully functional'.",5,0,2012-11-30,EBAY,0.1380230337381363,0.833971381187439,0.02800552174448967
