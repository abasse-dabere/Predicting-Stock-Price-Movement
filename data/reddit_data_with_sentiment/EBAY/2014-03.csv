Ebay,Received a negative feedback before I even sent the item.,"I have begun selling on eBay the last few months with success. Last week I sold some hair clippers and printed out the shipping label yesterday. I noticed that the buyer had left me negative feedback ""no good"". This dropped my score from 100 to about 93. I contacted them asking why the negative feedback before recieving the product. I received a response on another item I have listed that they "" wanted to know when Im going to ship their hair clippers?"" I responded that it was packaged and prepared to ship this morning and that I could remove their $5 shipping fee (which I did) to resolve the negative feedback. Also I stated that I could cancell the order if so interested. No response. This morning I went ahead and just shipped them priority and let them know so. I also placed a notification with eBay. As I am new with this,what do I need to do to best rectify this matter? Is a low seller ranking is bothering me more than it should? Or am I just in the wrong by not getting it shipped off quicker?

Ebay,Winning bidder accusing me of using shill bids and hasn't paid yet. Can I cancel his bid and relist it?,"I sold an item for over $100 in an auction listing.  The auction had over 40 bids with almost all of them coming from the same bidder bidding in $2 increments 30+ times in 2 minutes (I believe he was using some STUPID mobile app that lets you bid like this but that's beside the point).  The winning bidder- who only bid once, early in the auction- only won because the person bidding in $2 increments had 1 bid go over the other guys max bid, at which point he retracted it and let the other guy win.  The winning bidder (now accusing me of using shill bids to drive up the price) isn't paying and said he's gonna ""see what ebay has to say about this"".  I called ebay and they said I did nothing wrong, and if the buyer doesn't pay in 4 days I can open a non-paying bidder case against him.  

From the language he used in his email, this guy is convinced I used shill bids to drive up the price until it was at his max bid and anything ebay tells him probably won't change his mind.  I don't want to deal with him anymore.  I know that even if he pays and I ship the item he'll try to screw with me by saying it was ""item not as described"" or something just to get a refund and ding my feedback anyway.  Can I cancel his bid now without waiting for a non-paying bidder case to open and be resolved?  

I'd rather not deal with this idiot anymore.  He's obviously mad that he has to pay his max bid.  

**TL;DR** winning bidder thinks I (the seller) used shill bids to drive up his max bid.  He hasn't paid yet and I'd rather just cancel his bid now and offer a second chance to the other person or just re-list the item.

TLDR summary: Shipped an item, tracking number says delivered, buyer claims they never got it. Buyer gets refund, I get shafted

I thought I'd be ok in this case since the tracking number showed delivered, left on front door. The buyer didn't respond with anything other than 'received no satisfaction from UPS or the buyer.' I submitted it to the resolution gods, and they found in favor of the buyer.

The reason given was that the detailed tracking info lists the delivered city as Gettysburg, and the buyer's address is the next town over of Hanover.

I dug up the original paperwork I submitted to ship it, and I did indeed ship it to the correct address in Hanover. I called ebay appeals with this information and they said it doesn't help, since I am the shipper I am responsible for hiring a company to deliver so I have to pay for it when it gets lost.

It went back to the seller's state, but is still listed as 'In transit' to this day. It WAS NOT delivered to me.

The seller was a little rude in communicating with me and he said it was not my error, it was eBay's error in printing the label wrong, and that he doesn't have time to check every address before he sends it out. I told him all I want is for him to ship it to the address that I provided at check out. He said he didn't want to eat the shipping costs so he was going to try to contact eBay, and he told me to try to contact eBay too.

The best I could do was the Answer Center. A while had passed by now so they suggested I open up an item not received case.

It was denied because "" We received tracking information from the seller that shows the item was delivered to your address. ""

I appealed saying this must be a mistake, because the tracking information shows it being sent back to the seller and I don't have any other tracking information, and my appeal was denied.

Ebay,How can I stop part swapping from buyers,"Hello,   

I am having a problem with my ebay listings. Buyers have recently began to purchase the item and after receiving claim there is a problem and want a refund. After a handful of returns I have begun to notice that the buyers have been swapping my good parts for their bad parts and then contact me for a refund. I would like some help in how I can combat this.   

Is there some way of putting some type of writing that is not visible to the eye but when a photo of it is taken, it can be displayed? For instance when I list the item on ebay the photo will have the hidden writing displayed, but the only way to display it is manipulating the photo? I would just like it to be in the listing image to prove when they dispute that things were swapped and it is not my original item that was returned (because of the replaced parts).   

I thought of marking parts on the item but I feel that is too easily noticeable.    

Anyone have similar problems? And how can this be fixed on my end? It has really began to add up and I would like to get this fixed as soon as possible.

Ebay,One major thing I wish eBay would change about listing items,"I have hundreds of listings right now, and many of the items I sell have multiples available. For example lets say I have 10 of an item for sale, run a 30 day fixed price listing and 2 sell in that time. Then when eBay has a free listing day I relist all of my old listings. It resets that auction to having 10 units available again and not 8.  This really sucks. I try to keep track of my sold items and manually update the number available during the relisting but its easy for things that do not frequently to go unnoticed. 

Just tonight in the exact situation as my example a buyer bought the remaining 10 items I had in stock only to find out I only had 8 left. I started with 23 items a year ago and had kept the listing updated up until this last relisting phase when I missed a pair of units that sold last month, now I have a potential upset buyer on my hand.

Ebay,A series of unfortunate events...And now I need help.,"Hey folks... Long time lurker, first time poster. But given my predicament, I had to break my silence. I couldn't make this up if I tried...

I was on Ebay cruising around, making low-ball bids on random things just to see if maybe I could steal them. It never happens, I'm just bored.   

I happened upon the iPad Air page to watch an auction that I had previously put a low bid on-- Honestly, I've never wanted a tablet, I've got a desktop and a laptop, never needed more than that. I opened up this one auction that was ending in a few minutes just to watch it end. It's fun watching the last rush. 

What happened next I've been trying to piece together for a little while now. I use a wireless mouse on my desktop (Which I was on). I got a text on my phone which was next to my mouse, and I inadvertently knocked the mouse off my desk. Apparently my pointed was somewhere near the ""1-click bid"" option, because when the mouse hit the floor, it clicked that, and I ended up making a bid I had no interest in making. Of course, that bid ended up being the winning bid.

Now, I sell a lot on Ebay, and I hate it when buyer's don't pay or seemingly get buyer's remorse. Fortunately I have the money to cover the iPad, so I paid the buyer but now...Apparently I'm the (proud?) owner of a 32gb ipad. 

My question is this: What do I do now? I really have no interest in having and using this thing. Should I cut my losses, resell it, and just take whatever I get for it? Or is there a way I can trade it in for more money back? Is there any way for me to turn a profit? Any suggestions you guys have would be very much appreciated. This sucks. 

For reference: It is an iPad Air 32GB Wi-Fi Only 9.7 Inch in Space Gray and it is factory sealed. I spent $565 on it. Ugh.",4,3,2014-03-06,EBAY,0.04127040505409241,0.9220154285430908,0.03671415522694588

I listed this as ""no returns"" when I put up the auction.

Ebay,From Russia with Love.,"I know silly title, but I have an issue. A kid in Russia is trying to buy a pair of DC shoes I have for sale, new in box. I am part of eBays global shipping program and I guess they keep charging him the tax,shipping and custom fees, but not for the item. Here is what are messages have been like. What could possibly be going wrong? They say it is now my problem but I don't know what is going on. This guy has 40 positive stars 100% feedback, not only do I want to make a sale, but I believe in good customer support and really want to help this dude out. 

Russian: i just sent the money for the order (Mens Size 12 DC Skate Shoes), but unfortunately the payment was done only for the shipping (36$), not for the item, the bank said that it wasn't enough money on my account, so i put some more $ onto it. so, how should i pay now for the shoes? i mean when i see the order it still says that i have to pay the whole price including the item itself and the shipping, but money for the shipping were already charged from my card.

Me: I need to do some research but what happen is I am part of eBays global shipping program, what you paid for was shipping to Russia from the US and the small customs fee. What I do is mail the item to a different location in the US and then they mail it again to you. The thing with the global shipping program is you are 100% guaranteed the shoes. eBay takes care of all the paper work and foreign affairs stuff to protect the buyer and seller. As of right now the item hasn't been paid for, but the shipping and custom fees have been. I personally have not received any money from you. If you still want the shoes continue checking out, if you want your money back then you may have to call eBay customer support and tell them what happen. The location of the shoes is California in USA.

Russian: hi,
well, i just tried to continue checking out and pay for the order once again, but they charged my credit card again only for shipping!! (36$) unbelievable... i've never had such a problem before with Ebay, indeed

Me:Contact eBay and let them know what is going on. Tell them they charged your card twice already and you are trying to purchase some shoes from America. Ask them what is going on. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Russian: yes, i wrote the letter to the customers support, now i'll have to wait for the responce from them...

Me: I called eBay for you. They said the funds that eBay charged you have been sent back to your bank account. Now it could take a day or two for them to show on your bank account. They said a few thing could of gone wrong. You may not have had enough money for the transaction and they suggested to put enough money from your bank account to your paypal account and then try to pay and any left over money send back to your bank account. They also suggested that you may have Global settings on your paypal account blocked. So you would need to log into your paypal account and make sure the settings are turned on that allow you to handle world wide transactions. Again the eBay agent I talked to said that the money you tried to pay with has already been sent back to your bank account.

Russian:Customers Support responded:

""Hello Russian (Not real Screen name)

I am truly sorry for this error you are receiving. I am looking into this further and trying to get a detailed response.
From what i see on Paypal the seller is showing as payment denied.

Ebay,"Buyer keeps changing mind, what do I do?","Hi, hope you can help. Been using eBay a while, but fairly new as a seller and haven't had any issues until now. Don't really know what to do with this one.

Sold two games on 27/02 to the same person (who, possibly irrelevantly, was using the same username and delivery address, but had different buyer details between the two items).

Buyer immediately messaged me saying he would pay in a few days - I said that'd be fine. Later that night I receive the payment anyway.

On 28/02 he messages me saying ""i dont want it now"" for both items.

On 01/03 I open a Cancel Transaction case for both items. He rejects one and ignores the other, and doesn't contact me further. I message him, asking if he wants me to open another case so I can issue a refund, to which he responds ""no I want them the games I buy please"".

I message him making sure to specifically confirm that he wants both items. All I get is ""i want them now"". I tell him I can ship one of the games out, but can't do the other until he rejects the cancel transaction case for it.

On 03/03 I mark the game that he rejected the case for as dispatched. I don't actually dispatch the game though, as I have a pretty sinking feeling something weird going on here. I figure he'll message me, tell me the game hasn't arrived and I can just give him the refund and get out of this.

My gut was right. On 05/03 the buyer messages again with ""dont want it"". I ask if he means the one item of both - he says both. I discover I can't open a Cancel Transaction case again because I've already done so once, so ask him to do so.

Utter silence since.

What the hells going on here? How do I get out of this? He immediately gave me positive feedback but I'm worried that this might blow back in my face if I don't deal with it correctly. I can't find anywhere to open a case for ""Buyer is an idiot."" Any help appreciated.",7,2,2014-03-07,EBAY,0.058473918586969376,0.9105688333511353,0.030957268550992012
Ebay,Identifying best selling format,"Ever single one of my sales on eBay have been in an auction format, I have had no success what so ever with fixed priced listings and I have no idea why. After researching completed and sold items for product that I want to list there have been times where I find that for a high sell ratio item 90% are fixed priced and the few auction ones found tend to sell for a hefty discount compared to fixed priced. Yet I have the lowest priced fixed price listing and still have no luck. Obviously the better choice would be to list it as a fixed price but I have never had a successful sale. This is particularly disheartening after reading stories of people selling an item for a much higher value after leaving it sit for a few weeks or so. For example, one item I listed today sold for an average of about $10.00 at a fixed price but rarely more than $5.00 in auction format. Maybe this is because of a low starting price and view count? But for some reason all of the auctions starting above $5 never sell. There must be something that I am missing and I'm tired of missing out on potential revenue.

Ebay,"Hopefully not getting screwed on a purchase, but it looks like it...","I purchased an item via a Best Offer this past Saturday (3/1), and I'm having a bit of a scare. Here's the timeline of what went down:

* Saturday - Best Offer accepted and paid for (including 2-day shipping)
* Sunday - Shipping label made and tracking info updated in Paypal. Expected ship date, Monday 3/3. Positive feedback left for me
* Monday - No movement on the tracking, just ""Shipment information sent to FedEx""
* Tuesday - Same deal
* Wednesday - Same deal, I send a message to the seller asking for an update. No response
* Thursday - Still no response to my question, no tracking updates
* Friday - Another message to seller, no response again
* Saturday (today) - Third message to seller, no response. Today is also the last day in the ""Expected to arrive by"" range.

So, I've sent three messages with no response, and the seller hasn't actually given the package to FedEx a week after I paid. Normally I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but the fact that they won't respond to emails gives me a little cause for concern. Another oddity is that their eBay location is in California, but the item is shipping from Minnesota.

My plan is to open a Resolution Center claim on Monday, and hopefully they'll respond to that. If not, how do these things usually go? I should be able to get a full refund, right (it was a pretty large item)?

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions and reassurance, everyone. It was my first potentially-negative experience on eBay, and a particularly high-ticket item (for me, at least), so it helped put me at ease for sure.

Ebay,Best Offer switcheroo,"Not a big deal. 

I had an item listed as a Buy Now or Best Offer. Received a crappy offer - rejected it. Ebayer puts in another bid, which wasnt bad, but not good enough so I rejected it. Then I get another bid for a little over the buy it now price. I chuckle and accept the bid. As I click accept, I see that in the Terms box the ebayer has put Free Postage. 

Now the item is heavy and free postage is not an option.

I had to manually send an invoice and did so for the amount + postage as per the listing.

Of course we're now in an ebay message argument with him telling me to give him free postage, and me pointing that the postage is as per the listing. 

Anyhow, I've told him that he's wasting my time, and he's said he's gone to ebay (which is what I suggested he do in anycase). 

It's not really a big deal, just a learning experience for me. And he's been added to the block bidder list. 

There's no way on Gods Earth this guy is going to get the item. If he does it'll be covered in fecal matter and other bodily fluids. 

But seeing as I have Reddit to refer to I thought I would. 

Does anyone know what ebays response will be? And how I should best handle it. By the way I was polite in the ebay messages up until the last one as my patience had run out. 

Just a casual ebayer looking to up his game BTW

______

Slight update:- buyer has forwarded correspondence from ebay saying that the seller is expected to manually review the Best Offer terms, and as such I'm responsible. I've also seen an article saying that mistakes happen and ebay is understanding of that. 

I've contacted ebay and told them that I did not see Free Postage prior to accepting the bid and that it's the first time i've sold an item via Best Offer and was not aware what to look for etc. 

I've also told the buyer that I have no intention of selling the item without postage being paid for. I've asked him to be reasonable but I expect him not to be. 

I'm thinking that if ebay instructs me to re-invoice to the lesser amount, and I receive payment, that I can refund his payment. Am I able to do that? Can I say that i've lost the item or it was damaged etc, and then re-list the item in a months time or something? Obviously he's the kind of person that wants to make things as painful as possible so there's absolutely no way he's getting it for the lesser amount.

_______

Slight second update:- hurray, problem solved. Essentially I told the buyer that I thought he was trying to take advantage of me and I said that he can either be reasonable, or he can carry on being unreasonable it will be unlikely to work out for him. He buckled and said that he'd like to pay something towards postage and asked me to re-send the invoice with a postage fee, albeit lower than it should have been. I told him to go through the proper cancellation process, which he did. 

He's apologised for being a pain. 

I've blocked him. 

I'm thinking of re-listing the item at a higher amount now, as I've just looked into it and the item has sold recently for higher than I had it listed. I'm in no rush to sell it. 

The only concern I have is that he now has access to my contact details, I believe, so he could pptentially be a pain if he wanted to be. 

I did type him a final message basically scolding him for not being reasonable and just wasting time etc, but I deleted that in case it caused further problems. 

Here's the quandry. Should I block him or unblock him? Should I raise the price or allow him to buy at the original price.

Don't suppose it matters, I'm not obliged to relist it until I want to.",8,3,2014-03-10,EBAY,0.08291119337081909,0.8888007402420044,0.028288062661886215

Right now my PayPal has his funds in it, though I'm a new seller so they're not available yet...

Ebay,"Once again, Ebay is making it harder on the sellers. New rules for Top Rated status making major changes.","Starting with the August 20th review, Top Rated Sellers will no longer have 4 categories to worry about. Just Two. The first category is the Item As Described. Right now a seller will get low mark for 1 and 2 stars. When the new system starts it will count 3 stars as a low seller mark. The Second is Shipping Time. A rating of 1 star will get your account dinged. 

Those who offer free shipping for the automatic 5 star rating are screwed and those who communicate with the buyers are screwed because they no longer count towards the DSR. 

Top Rated Sellers will also have to start accepting up to a 92 day return policy during the Holiday Season. WOW! Any Item item sold November 1 thru December 31 will have to be accepted as a return thru January 31st! Can you imagine selling something on November 1st then 92 days later that person wants a refund! That's INSANE!

I guess the silver lining is that I won't get a low DSR if I start charging for shipping now. Looks like that's the path I'll start taking.

Ebay,Paypal Held Funds,"So I've had the paypal holding funds for up to 21 days thing for a while now (since I just got back in to ebay selling a year ago, I guess they consider me ""new"" even though I've been buying and selling off and on since 2006 with the same ebay and paypal accounts).

Ebay,Is my buyer a scammer? What do I do?,"My son sold his old iPhone 4 on eBay a couple of weeks ago. The phone was in great condition when it was shipped.

Now the guy is asking for $50 because he now says he paid to have it fixed. This is my sons first eBay transaction so we are rookies in this area.

Ebay,Question regarding refunds or partial refunds,"The case is this: I recently sold a clock on eBay. It was a nice wall clock stored in a box. I got it up for a Buy it now and it sold in a few moments. No problems here. 

Now, yesterday I got a message from the lady saying this: 
&gt; ""Hi, I got the clock today, and come you find out its missing the base, please see picture attach, this is how the original clock looks, somebody modified the clock at one point. At this point i would like to return this clock for a full refund, or ask for partial refund of $150 so i can find a base for it. Thank you, X""

A picture was attached where it displayed the clock, the exact same one on a base. 

So I Reply: 

&gt; ""Hello, I've tought about the options, and would like you to pay you the refund as soon as I receive the clock back from you. This is the full amount, shipping and return shipping included. There was a lot of interest in the clock and I will try to sell again. Thanks for providing the given information. Could I have a source for this kind of info? I can use this for selling the clock again and having a more complete listing. Thanks.""

And now she replies again: 

&gt; ""Hi X, Thank you for letting me know, i really would like to keep the clock, please consider a small amount of partial refund, so i can start working and restoring the clock. Thank you

Any suggestions on what I should do here? I would not like to give her $150 back on a $400 clock, and she knew when she bought it the foot was not there. I think it is kind of weird to start giving partial refunds after you purchase something, or is that just me?

Ebay,"So, eBay's new selling rules just put me out of business.","I am a top rated seller with one hundred percent positive feedback. I sell between twenty and forty thousand dollars worth of stuff each month, and my customers love me. The problem? I sell used electronics. People who buy electronics will open a case for anything; ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING. Let's go through my ""defective"" listings, which by my count make up about 7% of all my listings:

3%: Customer opens a case to find out how to turn on their phone, turn up the volume, plug in the headphones, etc. etc. Frivolous cases, I take care of these pretty quickly. 

1%: USPS problems. Packages that never arrive. Full refund with no hassle every time. 

2%: Buyer did not read my incredibly detailed, very well written posts correctly. I take care of these with a full refund issued after the buyer mails the item back. To keep customers happy I always pay return shipping. 

.5-1%: I make a mistake. There is some kind of mix up, or I mailed something out incorrectly. Full refund with return shipping paid by me, plus extra money sent through PayPal. 

So let's see what we have here. I have a are number of frivolous cases opened by buyers. It doesn't bother me, it's just part of retail. I have one hundred percent positive with a very high selling volume, and I love taking care of customers. And when the new selling standards come into affect I will probably be kicked off of eBay. Anything more than 5% and you are gone. I don't think there is anything I can do. I already have very well written posts–at least in the upper five percent for the category I am in. I take care of all questions, and I include a phone number and customer service insert in every package. I am fucked.

Ebay,Rule II has changed.,"The change is that eBay links are now *forbidden*. The line has simply become to fine to allow some links while removing most of the others. In all fairness, this is the best route as the majority of the eBay links violated the Rule as it was previously written (self auctions or spam).

The good news is that if you want to post an interesting auction or would like feedback on your own listing, a screenshot would suffice and likely would not break any rules. This has always been the case but I think most users were not taking this route due to the ease of posting from eBay.

I realize that rule changes don't always vibe well with the community but I hope you understand the reasoning behind this.

Remember, there are a few subreddits that encourage the posting of self auctions like /r/redditbay, /r/flipping and /r/coinbay.

Update- my buyer couldn't locate a place to open a case with ebay, it kept redirecting him to PayPal. There never was an option to lay out the details that it was the fault of the Global Shipping Program. So he filed a dispute, but what came to me was that PayPal is demanding a refund of the ENTIRE auction price (remember, the auction was for a laser disc player and 8 discs, and the discs made it there fine).

The buyer is fine with pursuing this this way and says he'll refund the $50 I sent him before I talked to you fine folks, assuming ebay takes responsibility for this, like you all said they should in my first post.

Is he doing this right? Am I missing a step? Is there a direct link someone could share that is the correct way to file a dispute based on eBay's Global Shipping Department damaging a product? Should he get on the phone instead?

I used their tool to correspond with the buyer, verified the tracking number was correct, and posted a direct link to the USPS website with the tracking number for the buyer to monitor. I began to correspond with the buyer via the ""Case"" interface, where I learned that he wanted me to contact USPS, that the buyer did not go to the USPS website, nor did he contact his local USPS office.

Basically stating that he had mail forwarding, which would explain why he never received the package. Per USPS recommendations, I opened a case with them to see where this package was (and have still heard nothing from them).

In the end, the package ended up going to SC and I responded with this message

Went to the resolution center, saw the case, no appeal button. 

Googled the problem, saw that I am not the only one that can't find the darn button, and found an explanation that the appeal button only shows up if eBay decides it can be appealed.

Ebay,What's my best argument to eBay for getting this negative feedback removed?,"Here's the story:  I bought tickets to Austin City Limits Fest last year, since you have to buy them eons in advance. I soon switched to another job I couldn't take off work for. So I sold them on ebay before they depreciated (happens a lot the closer to the date of the concert on Craigslist).  My buyer ""simplygort"" didn't read my description stating I would be mailing the tickets until the date that C3 would send the tickets. It was VERY clearly stated in the auction.  Anyway, the buyer was pissed when he didn't receive them by the end of the week. I sent the buyer the actual page from ACL stating they wouldn't be mailed till such-and-such date (like a 1-2months later).  

I called ebay and they were basically like ""We can't do anything other than provide the buyer with instructions on revising feedback, Sorry!""  So they did that, CC'd me on it. The buyer CLEARLY did not understand. In fact, I don't even think he understood how to use the feedback system at all.

[See hilarious screenshot of his attempt to leave/correct feedback!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/ooXUsuu.jpg)

I wouldn't really care so much but I recently started to aggressively buy and flip stuff on ebay again. I've been a member since 2002, with 473 transactions and 96.9% positive feedback. I was 100% till he came along. 

I **know** eBay has the POWER to freaking remove negative feedback.  It's obvious the buyer is technologically-impaired by his feedback comments.

So tonight I am going to call and make an attempt to get the feedback removed. What would you consider my best argument? I don't want to be a jerk, but the dude has seriously affected my rating out of sheer ignorance.

I had to retract a bid after I saw the postage price. It said 'Varies' but without an actual value.

I only found out that it was going to be US$50 (to Australia) because the seller is selling another item of the exact same make and model and on that page it did show postage.

When retracting I put 'differs from item'.. or whatever it said. I hope I havent screwed anyone over.

Ebay,"MC999 Listing Policy Violations, Selling Accessories No Longer Permitted","I've had the last two things I listed get immediately removed and then I got banned from listing new items until I agreed to take their seller tutorial about copyright infringement. My horrendous violation??? I listed branded accessories (a COACH storage bag for COACH purses and separately, an iPhone box), without also including the core item along with the listing. Apparently this is now a big no-no for ebay sellers...

Anyone else dealing with this? Seems like a complete BS policy to combat counterfeits like they're claiming it's supposed to solve for. There are plenty of people out there who need to replace an accessory, and are fine with a used or like-new one, and don't want to buy an entirely new COACH bag or iphone to get the stupid accessory.

The biggest problem I have with the policy too is it's not uniformly enforced in the slightest.  Both items I had removed by ebay still have tons of other active and successfully completed auctions for the identical items!

Ebay,Friends DVD box set fake?,"I bought a box set of Friends off eBay and it turned out that the season 1 DVD case came to me broken.

Additionally, I've noticed some other oddities as well. The colors of the DVD covers seem a bit washed out, the quality of the video itself seems pretty terrible, the DVD inserts are all damaged by the closing of the DVD case, the inserts that are folded in half don't seem to be exact (the images are cut off too soon or too late, not precise), and my DVD set looks nothing like this DVDs layout from Amazon (4th picture).

These are the following details to help you tell me what I am missing.

2) I am TRS, they are not. - It has been like this for 1~ year
3) I have 99.8% feedback, they have 99.1%

Ebay,Ebay postage details section peculiarity,"I have several ebay accounts. One is a store - the others I just have free listings.

Ebay,Italian Buyer Wants Me to Send to Non PayPal UK Address,"I recently sold something on eBay to a guy whose eBay account is based in Italy. The address registered to the account is Italian. However, after they bought the item they requested that it instead be sent to a completely unrelated UK address to an individual with a different name to theirs.

Apparently he's added the new UK address to his PayPal account but it didn't show when I tried to resend the invoice, nor is it showing when I try to print out a postage label. They said that when they tried to pay no UK postage option came up (even though I provide 2nd, 1st and special delivery options) so could only pay with the Italian address.

They've been on eBay for 4 years and have a feedback rating of 9.

I'm very reluctant to post it out to the non PayPal address for obvious reasons. eBay told me to get in touch with PayPal for them to get back to me with whether the other address is legit but I've heard nothing yet.

Ebay,EBay noob and kayaking noob equals me getting ripped off....maybe. Help!,"So a good friend of mine from up north finally moved down to my town on the gulf coast of Florida. Since I had last seen him, he's gotten into kayak fishing and through subsequent trips, has gotten me into kayak fishing. he has a 2012 14' Hobie ProAngler (for those of you not familiar, these things are more like one-man boats and less like a traditional kayak) Here's a link to paint a better picture:http://www.hobiefishing.com/mirage/mirage-pro-angler-14/.

I have fallen in love with this hobby (and Hobie) and attempted to find a used lesser model on EBay until I can afford to get the Pro Angler. Used models are tough to find as most buyers hold on to theirs and actually use them. 

After searching Craigslist and EBay for a few months, I came across an auction about an hour from my hometown. I have exactly 6 transactions on EBay and all of them had been ""buy it now"" and had never been through the auction process up until this point.

Hobie Mirage Outback, no reserve starting at $800. I paid no attention to the auction (as I was out fishing with said buddy on the Sunday it ended) and returned to the office Monday morning to find that I had won for $890.

I paid the seller through PayPal and awaited location details for me to pick up. The seller contacted me stating that he hadn't received payment, while on my end, it was ""awaiting"" acceptance from the seller. Turns out that he linked the wrong PayPal email address after I had tried to resubmit payment. he contacted me with the right address and I tried to tender payment to the proper account to find that I had overdrawn my BoA account. I waited two days for the cancelled payments (2) to be returned to my account, remitted payment to the second account and drove an hour last Friday morning to pick up the kayak.

I arrived at the seller's rental property (as he made mention) to find an older model kayak (disclosed) in pretty good shape. The hull looked great. The pedal propulsion system seemed smooth and snag free with little to no rust. I gladly secured to the bed of my truck and headed for the office. 

I met with my fishing buddy the following morning and excitedly drove out to the beach for my new/used kayak's maiden voyage. I was in the water for less than 2 minutes before the sinking feeling in my stomach told me that I had been ripped off.

The rudder up/down control snapped as soon as I tried to lift it out of the water. I had tried this on land when I picked up and had noticed that the seller has ran twine instead of cabling for the rudder controls and I had planned on repairing myself. Not a big deal, I thought as I still had left/right for steering.

I slide the pedal drive (Mirage drive as it's called) into place and didn't get 10-12 strokes in the water before I heard an odd noise. I went to disengage the drive  from the mounting clamps (in order to pull up and inspect) and the left clamp immediately shifted upwards about 1""-2"". Clearly it had been stripped at some point and had been repaired enough to hold the drive in place for mere minutes.

Once removed the pedal drive propulsion fins were both glues to the drive and had started to fall apart immediately once placed in the water. As I was planning on upgrading to larger turbo fins, I was still trying to stay optimistic. And then I paddled back to shore (I hadn't gotten more than 20 yards).

I needed a beer at this point, (yes, it was early) and as I reached into one of the ""water tight"" holds, I saw that in the mere minutes that the kayak was in the water it had taken on 1/3"" - 1/2"" of water. Closer examination to the hull and the opening around the mounting port for the Mirage drive showed that what I thought was a ""wear point"" was actually a breech in the hull and a caulked area at the north point for where the Mirage drive sits in it's plastic recess during use.

Loaded up the kayaks, went to buddy's for a cookout and after a few minutes to regain composure, drove to a nearby authorized Hobie dealer to see if the kayak could be repaired. 

While the store owner clearly had an agenda to sell me a new kayak, he quickly told me that any Hobie Mirage drive kayak with a hole in the hull anywhere near the Mirage drive is a complete scrap. Since it is in a high stress area that will constantly have pressure on it, there isn't a product out there that could effectively repair it.

He then said, ""You got a good deal on that kayak, didn't you?"" ""A great deal on that kayak"", I replied. ""Well, that's because the seller knew that it was worthless and he fucked you on it"". That did not help my mood.

Filed a complaint stating that the product was not as it was listed. The description said ""Used. May show signs of cosmetic wear and tear but is otherwise fully functional and operational"". Clearly this was not the case.

I offered to take the hit on time and gas money to return (lesson learned) and the seller is (of course) fighting me on it. We still have a few days to go before anything can be escalated through the EBay Resolution Center, but does anyone out there have an experience like this and/or some advice?

Let the noob-shaming begin. Thanks in advance.",14,10,2014-03-19,EBAY,0.04441145434975624,0.8932012319564819,0.06238728016614914

Ebay,An eBay associate just told me that if you include all 12 photos in your listing your item automatically gets more exposure and views. Can this be?,"I'm confused. On the phone with customer service the other day I was told that if you maximize all of the 12 photos in your listing then your items exposure will increase. But what if your item doesn't call for more than just a few photos? How would this work? Say for instance you are merely listing a blank t shirt or something that doesn't need more than just a few photos to get the point across. Do you really need to take 12 photos of everything? If you don't take 12 photos, are you knocked back in the traffic line? Does ebay honestly expect me to start taking redundant close-ups of the fabric and stitching and such, until that proverbial 12th photo is reached? I don't think....I don't know. I'm scratching my head guys I don't get it. If this is the case then some of my listings would look just plain silly and unprofessional if I'm including all these extra/redundant photos of the same thing over and over simply to increase exposure. I was sure I misunderstood so I clarified with customer service on the phone that including all 12 photos increases view count and exposure and was specifically told that traffic would increase on my listings if ALL 12 photos were utilized therein. Huh??
What if you only do 11 then? Is that the same as just having 1 photo up on your items listing? Does exposure increase with each photo added? I must not be getting something here.

Ebay,"I have a couple questions before I start selling items on eBay. Complete beginner, so any help is appreciated.","First off, sorry for all the questions, I've got a lot of cards that I'd like to sell through Ebay, and know nothing about selling. 

I'm going to be using #000 bubble envelopes, and the weight of 1 card and the bubble envelope is about half an ounce. Should I just affix a stamp and the mailing address to the envelope, or buy some blank shipping labels and use those? 

I know Ebay has a [Creating shipping labels and packing slips on eBay page](http://pages.ebay.com/help/pay/printing-labels.html) so should I use that instead of using blank shipping labels or stamps? If I use a blank shipping label that I fill out myself, I'd still have to attach a stamp correct?

Should I pay the 19 cents for the Delivery Confirmation?

My only known expense so far is 6 cents per envelope. So whatever option I choose to ship it, Ebay shipping labels, blank label + stamp?, or just stamp, I'd like to keep the cost at a minimal, but still be complete and what I need to satisfy everyone. 

How much would the price increase if I add 1,2,3, etc ounces? 


If I'm correct, I get to list 50 items for free every month, but after that 50, I'll pay a small fee, along with the 10% final cut Ebay gets?

Ebay,How do opened item not received cases affect sellers?,"What implications do an item not received open case have for a seller? Can it result in a frozen eBay and PayPal account, even though the case is still open?

I've been waiting for a bag and some bag accessories that I bought on February 16th, and should have arrived by March 5th; seller never provides shipping. This is an international order from US to Canada. On March 10th he e-mails me saying the package is stuck in customs. I e-mail him back that night requesting a tracking number. No reply. I e-mail him again on March 13th, requesting a tracking number. No reply. I go to the eBay link to ask a question about my item not being received and request tracking information. Boom I accidentally opened a case. He e-mails me back within a few hours to advise that he doesn't know where my package is. He then sends me a tracking number that doesn't show up on the USPS website, and it's in a completely different format than what I'm used to when getting USPS packages, namely XX111111111US, and instead getting a 22 digit number. He then says that he needs me to close the case because eBay has frozen his eBay and PayPal accounts and that I'm causing his business problems. I have had one order from him in the past, and it came out okay, but I'm very uncomfortable with the way this is playing out. The next day he says that customs sent my package back and he should have it back tomorrow, he'll resend it, and that I should close the case. I called eBay support and they advised that having an open case will not affect the seller's ability to transact on the eBay or PayPal accounts, with exception of a hold placed on the PayPal account in the amount of the total purchase price. eBay support also suggested that I do not close the case. I feel terrible about causing this guy trouble, but at the same time I don't want to get screwed... 

I e-mailed him back saying that I didn't feel comfortable closing the case until I get the item or a refund, and that eBay said that he should have access to his account. He responded saying that eBay was wrong and they've frozen his accounts...

Ebay,Question on seemingly closed case...help greatly appreciated!,"So I sold a rather expensive item back in November of 2013 overseas.

Ebay,Are the Top Rated Seller benefits worth it on eBay Australia?,"Recently I got promoted to a top-rated bronze power seller. I was having a look at the requirements for the listings in order to receive the benefits. Basically:

&gt; **Requirements**
&gt; 
&gt; * Free postage to AU buyers
&gt; * Same business day or one business day handling
&gt; * 30+ day money back return policy
&gt; * Express postage option - offering delivery within one day

&gt; **Benefits**
&gt; 
&gt; * A prominent eBay Premium Service badge on qualifying listings. This is displayed both on the listing and in search results.
&gt; * Improved search standing for all Fixed Price listings in Best Match search results
&gt; 
&gt; Note: eBay Premium Service listings receive the most exposure in search, but other Fixed Price listings from Top Rated Sellers also receive some additional exposure.
&gt; 
&gt; * Australians registered on eBay.com.au who are Top Rated Sellers with Anchor Store subscriptions can list directly on most European eBay sites for $0 insertion fees. Specific listing criteria and category exclusions apply.

The only real advantage is a higher priority in Best Match searches while the disadvantages include fees taken away from actual postage fees as it is now included in the selling price (on eBay Australia, the final value fee is not applicable on postage normally so the new loss can range from $0.14-$1.53 per item) and return policy (which may become a hassle of dealing with returns).

I have done some research already and it seems that eBay US receives additional benefits including discounts of final fees and postage which make it really worth it. Unfortunately on eBay Australia it doesn't have those incentives.

So my real question is, do the advantages of Top-rated benefits outweigh the disadvantages on eBay Australia?

What do you think?",4,2,2014-03-21,EBAY,0.023156356066465378,0.9349810481071472,0.04186259210109711

""Spend $50, choose a free (product)!""

Ebay,Ebay Buyers or Sellers: My purchase is missing and it's too late to open a case...do I have any recourse?,"Hi Ebay Buyer or Seller-Redditors,

Wondering if you could help me out with some advice on a current situation since I've only purchased a few items on ebay in my life.

I recently spent $100 on a specialty item from a ""top rated store"" on Ebay (with 100% positive feedback) and had it shipped internationally to the UK (from the USA) via USPS. 

It was not picked up by the recipient in time, so it was sent back to the seller a month after it was shipped. 

I contacted the seller who let me know they would send it back to me as soon as they received it back at their warehouse.

It has been 2 months since the item was shipped back from the UK, and I contacted the seller who let me know they still have not received it back. 

They won't refund my money or send a replacement -(here's the item on Amazon, -which I will be sure to buy from in the future- in case anyone's curious): (http://www.amazon.com/Storm-Trooper-Hoodie-Marc-Ecko/dp/images/B00273YHFM for anyone curious)

I cannot open a case with Ebay since it has been more than 60 days since the date of purchase. 

Is there anything I can do? My case seems like a one-off and even though I know it could be worse, $100 is still a lot of money for me to lose at this point in my life.

Any insight on ebay/customs/shipping you could provide would be most appreciated. 


Thank you.",3,1,2014-03-21,EBAY,0.028248514980077744,0.8992453813552856,0.07250610738992691
Ebay,I think I'm about to get scammed by a buyer,"Last month I sold my Samsung surround sound and one day after it was delivered the buyer messaged me saying this:

&gt;I have received a Samsung surround sound and a so called bluray dvd . there is a piece missing off one ov the speakers and another one is split.also, bluray dvd doesn't work.plus it arrived in a condition like it has been buried in concrete.

The item was in new condition and I tested everything before listing. The amount of damage and the buried in concrete part made me feel like he was trying to scam me.

I replied to their message asking for photos of the damage and the serial in clear view but I never heard anything until on Wednesday when they opened an item not as described case against me.

I asked again for photos and this time they replied with these:

* http://imgur.com/agCBR5b
* http://imgur.com/yE0NWG4
* http://imgur.com/3VqOkSg
* http://imgur.com/v7HUZrq

The photos where you can clearly see the serial is the one that I sold to him. What makes me suspicious is that all of the photos are very poor quality and the resolution isn't the same on any of them when I'm sure it should be. I also noticed that on the photos where you can clearly see the serial it looks like the buyer has made sure that I can't see the side of it where the damage is visible in other photos. I can also see one of the main speakers set up under his TV.

I asked for better quality photos but they said they are ""crystal clear"" on their computer and their camera is 15mp.

When they bought the item from me they had 0 feedback but now they have 2 positive so I checked it and on the 12th of March they bought wires for the surround sound which has also made be suspicious because I didn't include any wires. When I asked about it they first said that they were for another surround sound system that they bought but later on in the day I mentioned it again and they replied saying that they were for the surround sold that I sold to him because they wanted to test it. Why would they want to test it when it's supposed to be clearly broken?

I've repeatedly asked the buyer for a photo of the damage and the serial in clear view but they either ignore that part of the message or replies with ""no more photos"". After that I asked them to send the surround sound back to me so that I can inspect it and then refund but they replied saying ""we will let ebay handle it"" and now I haven't heard anything since.

Normally I would just assume that it got damaged in the post but with all of these things added up it looks like it's a scam.

I'm sure ebay will just tell them to send the item back for a refund so I'm wondering if they do send back another item what can I do to prove it? I'm thinking about recording myself opening the box. I also have photos of the serial numbers and the unit before I sent it.",10,5,2014-03-22,EBAY,0.1321200281381607,0.8363877534866333,0.03149225190281868

Ebay,Why are bidders idiots?,"So common sense tells me that on a auctioned item, I should bid slightly higher than the minimum. Keep the price low.

And if you have a 10+ IQ, you should think, *people set up automatic bidders, so I should wait until there are only a few minutes left to start throwing money at the item, rather than have a bidding war with a bot and drive the price up days before it actually sells.*

However, on an item that I want (normally $700, bidding started at $.99) the initial bids are $150, then $300, $350, $500. Why not bid $2? Why is everyone insistent on driving the price up to retail as soon as it opens? Why are people driving the price up several hundred dollars more because they keep 1 up-ing a bot that is going to keep bidding anyway? 

Blah

EDIT: From ebay...

How to bid

Here's how to bid on an item:

Ebay,"eBay users of reddit, last month I released a chrome extension for eBay, this month I released the web app version.","First let me take a moment to thank all the wonderful people of reddit and /r/ebay who provided me valuable feedback, I cannot thank you enough. Your insight and feature requests pushed the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-search-for-ebay/kjajclaocdighkjplbekkofpmdbcjghf) to new levels of awesomeness!

There were several users that requested that the extension be brought out of the extension environment and into a web app and that is exactly what I have done. The extension was built using javascript so the transition could be achieved. After several rewrites I have completed what will be an app that many people will love to use. 

The focus has always been on speed; fast search results, quick access to saved search configurations and instant app load times. The web app was also ported over to use [twitter's bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for greater speed and responsive/mobile ready design. 

As many of you know, searching on eBay at times can be slow due to the UI and eBay ads, the aim here is to ditch most of the clutter of eBay and make searching faster for the auctions you are looking for. Fast Search for eBay also takes your privacy into consideration, no personal information is stored and no data is sold to third party vendors. This means no tracking cookies on what you search or browse. 

I have also added location based settings, IE the ability to search using a zip code. The app also refreshes search results every minute allowing the user to keep a the window open and see the latest results.

**Why would you want to use the web app over the extension?** 
The web app gives you more screen size to view search results and a bigger UI. I'm working on more ways to show a greater number of listings using bootstrap, but for now I'm showing as many as I can. As of right now searching with a zip code and radius is only available with the web app. I will be porting this over soon to the extension. 

So take a look and feel free to comment on things you love or the things you hate about the web app. In most cases, if you find a problem or request a feature I can make the changes immediately.

Ebay,"Received a counterfeit product, got a refund, however he also says he will refund the shipping for the return","TL:DR: See the title

  

I paid around $60 (including postage) for counterfeit make up. He has already processed the refund (according to Paypal), and he says he will pay the return shipping for me to send the product back once I send him the registered post details. I have no issue sending it back, as I cannot use this make-up knowing that the ingredients could be dangerous.   

  

How will he pay me for the registered post this if he has already issued the refund? We have only discussed through eBay messages, will I need to open a case to ensure he pays me the extra $10? Should I get the registered post number first, and then send that to him so I can get the refund before actually sending the product back? Am I just being pedantic, and just send it back on the whim I might not get that $10 back when I've already got the refund from both the item and postage from the initial transaction? 

For me, it's not about the $10. I just don't want to pay money for getting nothing. Otherwise, the process has gone very smoothly. I got the item within 4 days, was able to get the refund straight away. If it weren't a counterfeit product, this would otherwise be an idyllic seller. I've also never had an issue with refunds before (eBay noob) as most of the products I buy are fairly cheap anyway and not worth replicating.",12,6,2014-03-25,EBAY,0.06883455812931061,0.8986566066741943,0.03250882774591446

Ebay,Filing a police report on a scammer,"Hi all,

Recently I sold a coat as ""Brand New, with tags"". The buyer sends me a message asking for a full refund ~a month later, claiming my listing was erroneous. 

I was confused but double-checked my listing-- my title had the correct size listed but I forgot to change the size in the details! I admitted to my mistake and offered to pay for return shipping seeing as I made the error. 

The buyer then basically says ""Great! Oh, by the way, the tags have been removed"". 

I had assumed the tags and everything should be intact if she had received the wrong size. I immediately send a message to her that removing the tags changes things. The coat is no longer ""Brand new, with tags"" and I can decide if she gets a partial refund once I receive the coat. It's been a month, tags are removed-- it's reasonable to suspect the coat has been used.

She then opens a case through PayPal saying the item was significantly not as described. She even says that she has removed the tags. PayPal decides that she has to pay for return shipping and that I have to issue a full refund ($100) to her when I receive the item, if it is in its original condition (brand new, with tags).

She sends the item back to me-- not only are the tags removed but the coat has VERY OBVIOUSLY been used!! A few threads pulled out, pockets cut (brand new coat had pockets that were sealed, have to cut them open to use)! I appealed the case with PayPal, even uploaded a couple pictures online for them as evidence. Buyer has even said in the messages that she's removed the tags. That's still not enough evidence!

Now PayPal is asking me to get a police report or get a notarized affidavit. My question is, is it worth it to go to the police and file a report? Has anyone has experience with filing a report due to an eBay/PayPal case? 

Today eBay sent me an email saying they've removed a neutral/negative feedback from my profile (I'm going to guess it's from this scamming buyer). It's not a huge amount of money but this person has really pissed me off. What nerve!


[Edit] Yes, I agree that filing a police report is absolutely ridiculous. I called PayPal a few times today to try to get around having to deal with reports but they were mostly unhelpful (surprise, surprise). PayPal is making me file the report to essentially cover their own ass in case the buyer decides to open a case through their credit card company. $100 isn't a lot of money but I'm feeling vengeful. People shouldn't be able to do this and I'm not going to make it easy for them. I'm going to try to get a notarized affidavit tomorrow morning and try to win this case.",9,4,2014-03-26,EBAY,0.09756948798894882,0.8782941699028015,0.02413635514676571

Ebay,Forgot to leave feedback for a buyer. Am now being threatened.,"As the title says, I forgot to leave feedback for a buyer and the buyer has just recently (today) threatened me. This makes me want to go and leave negative feedback for that buyer for that transaction now. I looked at the feedback/rating extortion FAQ on ebay, but it didn't really say anything regarding in this instance and I couldn't report the buyer just in case as it's been over 7 days since the item sold. Was actually about a month or two ago.

Not sure that it matters, but the person bought a 0.99 cent trading card and then message me to don't worry about sending the item, however I did anyway and they now currently have it...or at least I'm assuming so as I have not received any open cases regarding an item not showing up.

My question is. Does the buyer have any ground to stand on here if I continue to not leave feedback or go and give negative feedback now?

Here is the message I received straight copy and past: 

""We are still waiting on you to complete our transaction. Please take a moment to leave us 5 star feedback as we have already done for you.

Ebay,Am I a bad person for opening a PayPal dispute?,"Long story short, I bought a watch off eBay and it turned out to be way smaller than advertised (size makes a big difference with vintage watches; 38mm+ vintage Omegas are much rarer and therefore more valuable). 

- Heard nothing from the seller after purchasing and paying straight away. 
- After prodding him, he said it has been posted. No tracking. 
- 4 weeks later I receive it. It **is** as pictured, but not the size advertised. 
- Send a message asking for a refund. He sends a half-assed response offering a ~10% refund if I want to keep the watch, otherwise I can have a full refund. No apology for the false advertising. 
- I open a PayPal dispute in order to have a third-party mediating the refund, as I frankly don't trust this guy and wasn't going to return the item without some kind of assurance. 
- First step is for me to contact him directly, via PayPal's system, and process the refund between ourselves (as he offered). No response from him. 
- I escalate the claim. PayPal attempts to contact him but they get no response after the standard week or so. 
- PayPal decide to refund my money. 

Once I get my money, he comes out of the woodwork and messages me via eBay saying ""Looks like you have your money, where is my watch?""

Ebay,Weird problem with ebay need help.,"Morning all.  I have a weird problem well two actually.

The first one is easy. I listed three Revlon flex shampoos and all of them were bought by a lady. Now I look for them and can only find two of them how can i refund the payment for one of them??


The second problem is the weird one. I received a message on Ebay saying my account is related with some other account and they think both accounts are used by the same person and since the account related to my account is banned from selling my account is banned too. I tried to call ebay for the first time but their hold time is loooong. How do i go on claiming that is not my account. After researching a little bit more I found that the mentioned account belonged to an ex roommate of mine who sold some duplicate phone cases and was in problem. But my account was never used by him. I have had my account for a long time and I have probably only sold about 25 items till now none of which are fraudulent. Can some one help??

Ebay,Is this a thing?,"I bought a $440 item from a seller with 99% feedback over 2 years about 2 weeks ago. Oddly, a few hours after I won his auction, I get a message from ebay saying the item was removed due to a violation of terms:  http://i.imgur.com/mbqLncJ.jpg

Since I already paid for the item, I decided to drop the seller a few messages inquiring about the status of my order.  I hear nothing.  A few days go by and I message him again asking for an update.  At this point, nothing has been marked as shipped and I can't even view the item anymore since it was removed from ebay.

Slowly, over the course of a few days, a bunch of bad feedback was left for him due to not sending items out and excessive shipping lag times:  http://i.imgur.com/1t4fFFS.jpg

I decided to open a case at this point, since I never heard from the seller and my item had not arrived yet.  He marked it as shipped the next day and continued to not reply to my inquiries.  I only have one more day until I can proceed with the case.  Is there any way I cannot win this case?  Only question is why the item was removed in the first place.  I also cannot leave feedback of any kind since the item was removed.  Any ideas why that has happened?  

Here is the seller's current feedback status:  http://i.imgur.com/p0cuxdn.png

He was at 99.1% about a week ago.

Any help would be very much appreciated.  Thanks for your time.

Edit:  Another clue is he went from verified in paypal to nonverified a few days after the auction ended.  Not really sure what that is all about.  Perhaps he was trying to cover his tracks so paypal wouldn't be able to claim that money back.

Ebay,"Received A Neg, eBay Removed It Even Though It Wasn't Strictly Within The Feedback Removal Guidelines","I have ragged on eBay support on here numerous times so I wanted to make sure and document this occurrence of competency. I sold a used item and noted in the description that there were cosmetic flaws in one certain area of the item and cosmetic flaws in general.

The buyer (without contacting me, not relevant) left a negative feedback stating that the item had cosmetic flaws. He did not mention the specific area that I did, just made a general statement. He even mentioned that there were cosmetic flaws in an area of the item that I did not mention specifically in the description.

Now that revised feedback still counts towards the defect rate I was obviously not going to reach out to the buyer so I went for the touchdown and called eBay support. They looked over the description of the item and the feedback for about thirty seconds and then removed it. 

I am honestly floored, I was expecting them to mention that the feedback must include something that says the buyer was expecting a new, non-used item - but they didn't. 

If you have any feedback removal success stories that flirt with being outside of the eBay feedback removal guidelines please share.

EDIT: To appease the buyer activists that frequent /r/ebay I would like to state that I believe this was a fair judgement by eBay support.

Apologies if questions like this aren't accepted here, eBay's customer service isn't of any help at all and google searches lead me to unregistered users regarding paypal which is not quite my issue.

I listed a phone and got it sold for $140. However, the buyer immediately messaged me when the auction was over and asked me to send it to ""lagos"" (Portugal?) and to see the payment details in the invoice requested. When going to the invoice request, I get this:

Ebay,Refuse a refund?!?,"Okay, so this is a bit of a strange situation and I can't seem to find a way to resolve this the way that I'd like on ebay.

I can prove the watches were bought form a legitimate source, but this does not seem to matter. 

All the pictures showed tags, boxes, and even warranty cards!

Can anyone offer any insight or help here? This makes no sense to me!",6,3,2014-03-31,EBAY,0.11043715476989746,0.8638584613800049,0.025704413652420044
Ebay,Local pickup only - buyer can't pickup,"Surprise surprise, clearly labeled LOCAL PICKUP ONLY auction won by someone who lives 1000+ miles away. They asked me to ship it at their expense, I said no since it would be almost $100. How do I cancel the transaction to get back my FVF. I have already refunded the buyer and was trying to find a cancel option similar to ""buyer cannot pickup"" or ""buyer never picked item up""

What would you do? TIA",4,3,2014-03-31,EBAY,0.07965517789125443,0.8706148266792297,0.04973001405596733
