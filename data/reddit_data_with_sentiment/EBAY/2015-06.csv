Ebay,feedback after a seller's cancelation,"In response to my request (I hadn't paid at this point), the seller canceled a sale and after receiving a message from ebay asking me to ""confirm"" the cancelation, I did so.

Now, before doing this, I did a lot of reading, both on r/ebay and on ebay's FAQ section, to make sure I could still leave feedback afterwards. (This is related to my last 2 questions here, the seller and I having agreed to do an off-ebay/paypal-only transaction.)

What surprised me after confirming the seller's cancelation at ebay's request was that I can no longer leave the seller feedback !

These are the threads I read (in addition to the ebay FAQ) that led me to believe I could still leave feedback as long as the seller (and not the buyer) instigates the cancelation :

I planned to leave the seller positive feedback after I got my item off-ebay (obviously), and my feedback would have been a generally positive comment. Not having this ""insurance"" has made me a bit nervous, especially since I really thought I would still have the option of leaving feedback.

I realize I'm covered by paypal to get my money back, but being able to leave feedback I thought was an added incentive for the seller to go through with the deal. Now that incentive is gone.

Ebay,Buyer lying about confirmed/received shipment. Best course of action to take?,"I recently sold an item to an ebay store who specializes in buying toners/ink. The first item they paid and received, no complaints. I received messages from them inquiring about selling more items, as they do a decent volume of sales.

I ended up putting an auction for buy now for three laser toners. The payment was processed, and they asked for the toners to be sent in a box (even though they were unopened and in separate boxes suitable for shipping). I put all three toners into a large box and sent via USPS. The box was received over three weeks ago. The dimensions of the box and weight of the box were documented via USPS, as well as confirmation of delivery.

Fast forward three weeks later and the buyer is telling me they only received one toner. If the box was received, either they received all three or they received none. The buyer is obviously lying, and the documentation I have indicating the dimensions of the box and weight I sent indicate that also. The seller opened a case against me asking for a refund for the two toners, indicating she never received them.

This is literally my second transaction and the buyer had 100% feedback. Why the buyer took three weeks to contact me seems suspect alone. Is there anything I can do aside from documenting the previous emails and shipping details to ebay?

Ebay,Fake SD cards? Why even bother?,"Xposted from ebay community.

**Backstory:
**
 

I have purchased a total of 3 Micro SD cards in the past month. All from different sellers. All fake/unusable. The first 2 were advertised as 32 GB, the last one, today, was advertised as 64GB. The first 2 were unformattable, unreadable, unusable. The one that arrived today was able to format after some errors popped up saying it was unreadable, [but would only show 1 MB](http://i.imgur.com/LIvc8C6.png).

 

I can see that it would seem like maybe I am doing something wrong, that I read the listing wrong (I always read the FULL LISTING - description, location and seller feedback) or that  ""there's no way all 3 of them were bad"", but I assure you, I read the full listing several times and I understand how SD cards work, and have several programs that help me determine the true storage capacity and test  flash memory. i also made sure to try with different card readers and different devices. I can safely say I did all troubleshooting possible to get them to work before contacting the sellers for a refund.

 

**Issue:**

 

It seems as if this is a trend, as I have read about many other people getting ripped off over a fake USB stick or fake SD/Micro SD card. If sellers are aware the product is defective, and send it out anyway, they have to realize that they WILL refund buyers' money one way or another. So why bother wasting time sending out cheap, defective crap?

 

If sellers are unaware they have defective items, it seems like they need to be a bit more proactive in making sure they're selling quality merchandise.

 

If the listing says ""64GB micro SD card"" one would expect to receive a ""64GB micro SD card"" Right? As a seller, why would you send us something that is not ""64GB micro SD card"". Is this done on purpose? Is this just a (comically common) mistake? Why bother at all?

 

TL;DR ""64GB micro SD card"" does not mean that is what you will get. Why bother? Discuss.

So basically i sold an Xbox on eBay recently and posted the item using royal mail 1st class signed for.

However i have received a notification stating that the buyer has opened a complaint/claim in the resolution center for an undelivered item.

2) In the past when my item has been delivered and the buyer has claimed non delivery i have shown them the tracking info and so instead they file an item not as described case.

&gt; You said the case is damaged, but is the tablet itself in perfect condition (no scratches, cracks, chips etc...)? Thanks.

His answer:

&gt; Yes perfect 

Well, today the item arrived, and his answer couldn't be further from the truth. There are chips on the entire metal band around the screen, as well as on the corners. There is also a large crack on the back of the item. There is no way to describe that as ""perfect"".

[Here is an album with pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/Clsv6)

If the seller didn't explicitly tell me that the item was ""perfect"", I could have lived with that. But I specifically asked whether it was perfect, and he lied to me.

I would have simply shipped the item back for a refund, but the issue is that this was an international shipment. The cost of shipping was $60, and on top of that I payed $50 in import taxes.

So my question is: What are my options here?

Thank you.",20,5,2015-06-04,EBAY,0.03265978768467903,0.9367611408233643,0.03057905100286007
Ebay,"Sold an item last month, the post office returned it to me yesterday for going unclaimed at the destination, and I had to pay the return fee. Now what?","Firstly, I am in Canada, the buyer is in Canada, and it was sent via Canada Post. A couple days ago I got an item slip in the mail, and when I went to see what had arrived, it was the item that I had sold last month, with a sticker saying ""RETURN TO SENDER. REASON: UNCLAIMED."" I had to pay that cost of shipping to get it back in my hands.

So now what? How do I contact the buyer and gently say ""Hey bud, did you not get a notice to go pick it up?"" without him freaking out and giving me a negative feedback. He *could* claim that he never got the three notices they would have sent out and then blame it on the post office and expect me to eat the cost of sending it back out again, which I have no intention of doing unless the buyer wants to pay both the shipping cost that it took to come back to me, and the extra shipping cost to send it back out, which I doubt the buyer would be willing to do (just a guess.)

So do I start something in the resolution center? If he wants a refund, can I refund him the amount he paid originally, minus the cost of shipping that it took me to gain possession of the item back from Canada Post because he wasn't paying attention to his mail? 

In all of my 9 years of eBaying, this has never happened to me, so I'm at a loss and don't know where to begin without risking my currently pristine feedback score. Any help would be awesome. Thanks.",7,4,2015-06-04,EBAY,0.03057488426566124,0.9128157496452332,0.0566093847155571

Ebay,"Buyer protection window has expired, seller is saying he has no record of my auction purchase. Any recourse?","Ok...this is a bit of a strange one.  In April my husband bought an amiibo, essentially on preorder with an Ebay buyer.  The purchase was made April 2nd, the item dropped May 29 and seller expected to ship it shortly after that.  I had some misgivings about it, but the guy had perfect feedback, so we figured we'd be ok.

A few days after we paid eBay sent a notice saying that the listing had been removed, that we didn't have to send payment, but if already had, all was well proceed as normal.  Fair enough.

Well, now it's 6/4, husband contacted the seller a few days ago and he reaffirmed that he expected to ship all orders Monday.  It's Thurs, no confirmation on shipping, so husband emails this guy again.  He says he has no record of our ebay purchase.  I've checked ebay and the protection window expired last month.  I checked Paypal and it refers me to the ebay resolution center.

I've emailed the seller again, giving him the payment details from paypal proving he was paid.  He responded that he will check it tonight when he gets home.  So...waiting to see if he's honest or not.

I'm pretty sure we're SOL if he decides to screw us over, but just wanted to check all avenues to see if there is any further recourse?

Ebay,Problem with seller that left out part of my purchase. What can I do?,"So I purchased a DSLR rig for videography and I was sent the parts for assembly. It came a bit late and was padded scarcely with paper towels, but it wasn't an emergency and everything seemed fine so it didn't bother me much. After inspecting all the parts of the kit I noticed a piece, which was pictured in the auction, was missing. 

So I messaged the seller, informed him of the issue. He apologized and said he'd send it out the next day. He even offered to guide me through the assembly process of the rig. I was very understanding, and took his word that he'd get it to me.

I thought I'd be kind of a dick to withhold feedback until I received it, so I gave him 5 stars and included message detailing my satisfaction with the seller. I was hoping it might even motivate him more to ship the part.

A week goes by and I haven't received the part. I send the seller a follow-up asking what the status on sending it out is like. No response. I wait another week before I send another message. Same result. It's been over 3 weeks now and I don't know what options I have at this point. 

I'm assuming I can't remove my 5 star feedback. Can eBay do anything for me? It's my fault for being naive I suppose. I don't do too much business on eBay.",9,3,2015-06-04,EBAY,0.0737076848745346,0.8947497606277466,0.031542547047138214

Ebay,Implications of 'item not as described',"Hello. I recently bought a used 3ds system where the item description listed 'Nintendo 3ds system with charger'

The charger I received is a cheap, all purpose charger that emits a very high pitched ringing as it is charging, which is a pain as my only power outlets are just over my ear above my bed (student accommodation). 

The 3ds stylus is also 3rd party, cheaply made and a vastly different colour to the console. This isn't hugely important but just interesting to note.

The console is pretty filthy, parts are stained yellow from cigarette smoke I guess - sticky in parts too.

The console works fine. Maybe a little more scratched than described. 

My question is - am I in the wrong if I give negative feedback for supplying me with cheap 3rd party accessories? The seller never stated the accessories would be cheap versions of the originals supplied by Nintendo - but he didn't say it wouldn't be either. Aren't official accessories *implied* here? I feel as though if you're selling a used console you should state if parts are not official.",17,2,2015-06-05,EBAY,0.04658070579171181,0.9167318344116211,0.03668748587369919

Ebay,Ebay charged buyer more for shipping?? First time selling.,"I listed something and miscalculated the shipping cost. No biggie, I'm ok with paying the extra on my side since it was my mistake. However, Ebay seems to have charged the buyer close to 2x the amount for the listed shipping, which would pay for the actual shipping.

Questions

1. How the heck did Ebay do this? At the end of the Auction, I waited for the buyer to pay, but they never did. I sent in a claim, and then the buyer sent the payment with the higher shipping costs. I'm guessing the buyer was hesitant to pay because the shipping cost was different than the listed cost. However, they never contacted me to complain. Should I put some money in the package as an apology? or should I email the buyer to give them a choice to cancel the order (even after they paid- is this possible)?

2. At the end of an auction, was there something I needed to do on my part? I thought Ebay would have taken care of this part. I hope I didn't need to click a button?

Ebay,A warning to new sellers: A common scam from Nigeria and how to avoid it.,"Hey, so I've been selling on eBay for many years but I recently introduced my girlfriend to the site and she always loved helping me pack things and wanted to learn how to sell her own items rather then getting me to do it. But the first sale she made, was targeted by a scammer so I want to share what happened.

So, the first items she sells are all electronics. And she sells her SLR camera to someone registered in America (Account made two days before the item was bought.. instant red flag for me). After the sale, she immediately got a request to send pictures to an e-mail address. She did this without telling me and this is when things escalated. She received a fake PayPal and eBay email/invoice showing money had been received in her account, followed by an address to post the item to Nigeria. She had actually received no payment. The scammer also pretended to send more money they needed, so she could send by ""best postal service"". She's not from the west, and has no clue about the sketchiness of Nigeria and it's business so what seems trivial to us can catch a lot of people off guard.

It all seemed very organized and professional, the fake emails seemed to be sent from a hacked site. So thought I'd share the experience. Although, it had been a great learning experience for her.

New sellers:

* Never respond to requests to communicate outside eBay

* Only get the postal address through PayPal/eBay

* Always check the buyers page

I resolved the issue by reporting the buyer, and opening an unpaid item case to ensure she will get the final valuation fee returned. I'm not sure if there is any way I can report the email/postal address in Nigeria.",3,16,2015-06-06,EBAY,0.03293924406170845,0.9258832931518555,0.041177500039339066

Ebay,New seller here. I need some advice on handling a return.,"I'm a new seller.

I sold a digital camera on ebay a couple weeks ago. It's 10 years old, but works well. It sold for ~$10.

An hour after it was delivered, buyer requests a return. Says the camera is defective. Says the flash doesn't work. Says the camera won't focus. Says the lens won't extend fully.

None of this was true when I sent it. But I figure hey, maybe it got dinged in the mail. Maybe it just decided to poop out cause it's old. I say send it back. eBay indicates I need to pay for the return, for selling a defective item. 

Camera comes back. Everything works well. Every problem the buyer raised -- every single one -- is wrong.

In principle, this is bullshit. I shouldn't have to pay for the return.

In practice, I'll probably say nothing and eat the return. 

But do I like this option? No.

What would you do?

Also I am donating a portion of profits to a Shiba Rescue both to raise appeal and because Im a really nice guy.

Day 1: Buyer buys iPad Mini 2 at $217.50 Buy It Now price

Da 4: Item is shipped out to Buyer.

Day 8: Buyer receives item

Day 9: Case is opened and PayPal freezes my account and funds.

The Reason for the Request Return was listed as ""iPad has 512MB of RAM when it should have 1GB!"" All iPad Mini 2's have 512MB of RAM the, eBay listing showed the item having 512 MB of RAM, but the buyer wants 1GB. All of these details were available to the buyer at time of purchase.

Day 15: I get the iPad back and everything is normal, but I am missing the Charger. I respond to the buyer asking if they could send the charger back and I get absolutely no response. 

Day 19: Escalate the dispute to eBay because I can't refund the entire transaction if they haven't given me the charger back and the buyer is unable to respond.

Day 20: eBay closes the case and rules in the buyer Favor - the message reads more like an automated response..

I have reviewed your case and I appreciate you are patiently working with your buyer to get this matter resolved. As we can see that the item was delivered back to you for them to get a refund, we have closed the case on their favor.

In the future, we would like you to always achieve a smooth transactions here with us. Here are some ways to avoid complaints that an item doesn't match the listing description:

a. Use a clear, complete, descriptive title.

b. Include the brand or artist, product name, and size in the description.

c. Imagine you're a buyer, and try to anticipate questions or concerns buyers may have.

d. Consider the words you'd use to search for your item.

I am sorry to know that you received the item back with missing charger. Since the case was closed in the buyer's favour, you can appeal the decision within 30 days in the Resolution Center by providing supporting documentation.

Here are some situations in which you might appeal a decision:

•The item was received within the estimated delivery time.

•The buyer asked for a chargeback on their payment after receiving a refund from eBay.

•The buyer returned a different item than the one you sent

Day 22: I appeal the case and an hour later I get this great response

After reviewing your appeal, we won't be able to change the outcome of the case, unfortunately.

We're sorry there was a problem this transaction. However, after further review, we confirmed that our original decision was correct.
After calling customer service they said the same thing and even though eBay heavily advertises ""Seller Protection"", there is nothing they can do for me. Since I got eBay involved in the procedure I forfeit my ability to recoup the selling fee, as it costs them time and man power to ""review"" my case.

In total I Lost - $47.70

Ebay,Question about the risks of buying a pre-order,"Hello!

This is probably a question that a seasoned vet could answer quickly and succinctly so no need to upvote. I'm currently holding (not buying) a pre-order of a popular collector's item that sold through very quickly. The item will not ship until September. Out of curiosity (I don't plan to sell), I looked to see if people were selling their pre-orders on eBay and, sure enough, they were. In fact, pre-orders are selling for about double the original $100 asking price! My question: Is it not risky for someone to buy and pay for (as many have) a pre-order now? My understanding is that you have 60 days to leave feedback so what would stop a seller from just taking the money, never shipping an item and never responding to any inquiries?",2,2,2015-06-11,EBAY,0.04387402534484863,0.9168311357498169,0.03929480165243149

Ebay,"New to Ebay, requesting help with transaction","Hello all,

I've recently purchasing used, no-activation PC games for their boxes to add to my physical collection of video games.

I recently took a gamble on [this](https://api.url2png.com/v6/P4DF2F8BC83648/001e039c2c05ea9a496d3753d9f28e5b/png/?thumbnail_max_width=851&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F261896200240&amp;viewport=1280x2000). $12.99 + $3.00 S&amp;H from Poland.

It arrived in soft shipping package ([like one of these](http://blog.stamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ScottyStuffer3.jpg)). I opened it up and it was damaged. I took photos and told the seller the item was damaged. He said the USPS is responsible for damage.

Upon closer inspection, I saw that part of the foldout that houses the discs was cleanly cut off. I received all 7 discs in good condition, but the box was modified. The description says ""Brand new,"" but even ignoring the shipping damage, it's been altered.

In addition, the box and contents are in Polish. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the box to be in English considering: the game description is in English, the region of the game in the description says ""WORLDWIDE"" (so I expected US or UK box), the asking price is in USD, and Polish isn't in the description anywhere.

I contacted him again about the alterations and language, and he said US customs must have opened it and he offered another Polish box without the discs. The packaging appeared unopened and I do not want another Polish box.

I offered a compromise. A partial refund of $12.99, I send the game back, and I'd give him positive feedback. He offered $5. I said no less than $12.99. Now he's offering $3.

What should I do? Should I wait for Ebay's grace period to end so I can ask them for help, or should I attempt to use the seller's ""Free returns""?

Thanks for your help.",3,1,2015-06-11,EBAY,0.024029340595006943,0.9085129499435425,0.06745775789022446
Ebay,I think I am being scammed... Help!,"I'll try and keep this as quick as possible, with all the details I have.

So I posted my very first sale, an item for a few thousand dollars, and someone purchased the item. However, it was a brand new account created the day of the purchase. They didn't pay the day of the purchase, but paid the next day. They then added $100 dollars to the purchase, and asked for it to be 1 day shipping, and asked me to tell the right when I ship the item. 

It all seems fishy to me! And although I've gotten emails from Paypal and Ebay to continue with the selling, it still hasn't shown up as paid in ""MyEbay""! It says it is still awaiting payment.

What should I do from here? How can I make sure that I'm not getting scammed? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!",10,5,2015-06-12,EBAY,0.021265219897031784,0.8818399310112,0.09689484536647797

Ebay,Getting my Money Back,"I purchased a collectors item of a video game but it never got here. This wasn't the first time the USPS has misplaced a package of mine, so I checked with the neighbors, they didn't have it either. I contacted the seller, who was actually helpful unlike the previous seller. They told me they'd do what they could on their end.

It ended with the USPS denying their claim, they told to try Paypal, who denied my claim and took the sellers side, the USPS says I can't make a claim for a refund because I never had the item and the eBay money back guarantee ran out while the seller told to wait.

Now I contacted the seller but he refuses to return the money. Paypal and USPS are no help and eBay only has their automated service. So I'm left without my money and the item.

Am I out of luck and 100 dollars or is there something I can still do? Thank you.",9,3,2015-06-12,EBAY,0.13356807827949524,0.8385741710662842,0.0278577022254467

Ebay,Feedback for a new seller.,"I won an eBay item &amp; paid the same day. I noted that the seller — totally new, no feedback at all — listed that they would ship in 3 business days via USPS First Class. That's cool, no problem. The item was less than $9 total including shipping, so even if something went wayward with a seller with zero feedback, I thought it was worth the chance.

After about 5 days of not getting an eBay shipping notice/tracking # or any communication from the seller, I wrote the seller to ask if the item had been shipped yet. I was going out of town for a few days &amp; wanted to know if I could expect it by then. 

Two hours after I sent that eBay message I got a shipping notification with a tracking #. Cool beans, I'm thinking. ...

I have the Parcel app on my iPhone — a very cool app if you send &amp; receive lots of packages — &amp; put in the tracking # so I could get updates on. Well, after about 6 days of the USPS tracking being stuck on “Shipping Label Created” I wrote the seller again asking if the item had been shipped because I hadn't received the package, nor any updates about its transit.

Three hours later it finally updated as “Picked Up” &amp; I got a message from the seller saying “sorry,” &amp; that it had been mailed that afternoon. 

I got the item in today, &amp; it's in the condition I expected, but I'm debating on leaving either positive or neutral feedback. 

From my perspective, the seller only provided me with a tracking # when I wrote/reminded them of it, &amp; only shipped the item when I said I hadn't received any tracking information on it. Had I had any communication from the seller explaining a delay I would understand, but an easy “sorry — it was shipped today!” after 10 days of not getting the item, or any sort of direct communication, kind of bothers me. 

I have 100% feedback, almost 1000 feedback stars, &amp; I leave really good feedback for sellers who communicate with me &amp; provide fast shipping. What gives me pause is that this seller is new. I don't want to “ruin” their feedback this early, but I also feel like I have an obligation to other buyers to note that this person did take a long time to ship &amp; had lackluster communication skills. 

What do you guys think? I feel silly for even questioning myself on this, but you all are a good sounding board. :)",8,1,2015-06-12,EBAY,0.03580731153488159,0.9261762499809265,0.03801644966006279

Ebay,Advice on proceeding with a seller who possibly unintentionally listed an auction with false advertising.,"I am new here, so please let me know if I give too much or not enough information to receive advice.  

**TL;DR-  I bought an expensive collectible lego set online advertised as complete, but arrived with 12 missing pieces, a missing sticker set, and no COA.  I dont think it was purposeful falsely advertised as complete, but I dont know what my options are at this point or how to proceed.**

I recently won an auction for a collectible lego set that was listed as a complete set.  The listing had a few amateur cellphone photos but the listing did not strike me as someone familiar with the product.  I believe they may be a company who lists consignment or something like that.  

Anyways, once it arrived, I set to work dismantling the set (as described in the listing it shipped only partially dismantled, as the seller either didn't want to spend the time or see the need to break the set down to individual pieces).  I used the ""Bricklink Reference Catalogue"" for an original parts list.  The set of 5000 pieces is missing 8 pieces and 4 ""surplus"" pieces (the left over extras that come with a set).  It is missing one of two sticker sets.  It is also missing a certificate of authenticity which came with every set.  

I am guessing the pieces are replaceable through individual order but I am not sure about the second sticker and very doubtful of the certificate.  I dont think the seller meant to mislead me, I doubt they bothered to check the set as complete, never having broken it down themselves, and I doubt they knew it came with two sticker sets and the certificate.  However, because it was listed as complete, I went into the auction to win it and paid as such.  Other listings that are upfront about missing items sell for more than 15% less.

So, what are my options here?  I was super excited to get this set and would be willing to track down the lost pieces.  However, I have a hard time reconciling the fact that I paid the going rate for a complete set and I am not getting that.  The seller also charged a large shipping fee for expedited shipping but their handling time exceeded the listed time by 2 days and the package arrived a week late, thus I have already had to inquire about refunding my shipping costs (at least for the expedited portion).  

Is it possible to get a partial percentage refund and keep the set and find the lost pieces, or is this a situation where if I am not happy I need to see a return and full refund?  I also think it would be unreasonable to pay return shipping, which they made a note of on their listing.  

Thank you very much for any advice in the matter!",12,5,2015-06-13,EBAY,0.08211400359869003,0.8903003334999084,0.02758566103875637
Ebay,Buyer wants to return an action figure after seemingly not reading the listing; what do I do?,"I've been downsizing various toy collections lately, and I listed a Harley Quinn action figure from Batman: The Animated Series at the end of May. I purchased the figure back in 1997, opened the package back then to make sure there weren't any loose joints, etc., put the figure back in the package... and that's about it. It had been in storage for almost two decades. I listed it on eBay as ""used,"" and in my listing I described how it was in great shape, how it was opened — yes, I used the word ""opened"" — but never displayed, and how the plastic bubble that holds the figure tray was still attached to the package cardback on its top side. A buyer purchased it (using Buy It Now) on June 2. I shipped it from Maryland that day, and it was delivered in California on June 4.

Smash-cut to: this morning at 6 a.m. I get an e-mail saying that the buyer has initiated a return request. His reason: ""It doesn't match the listing."" His comments: ""I ordered this item thinking it was new when in fact it was opened all along. I would like to return it for a full refund."" In addition to the full refund ($15.99), he wants return shipping ($6-something).

I've been very fortunate during the 15 years I've sold on eBay. This is my first-ever return request, so I guess I'd just like to poll the experienced crowd here and ask for suggestions as to what I should do. I don't think I'm in the wrong. It seems like he bought an item without reading the listing. eBay tells me that I have four options: 1) I can reply to him (which I obviously will be doing). 2) I can agree to his terms, he can return the item to me, and upon receipt I can refund him the price plus shipping. 3) I can agree to his terms and let him keep the item. 4) I can give him a partial refund and let him keep the item.

I'm a nice guy, and I plan on sending him a friendly reply that's basically like ""Sorry, but... ."" I have on my listings that I don't accept returns, so I'd rather not even offer him a refund only on the figure if he pays for the return shipping. (Not that it's even one of the four options eBay has provided me with.) I've read horror stories on this sub about buyers and returns and eBay getting involved and defects being issued, as eBay seems to almost always take the buyer's side in disputes. If I gently remind him that the listing stated that this was a ""used,"" ""opened"" figure, and if he opens a dispute with me or whatever, is eBay likely to take my side?",12,5,2015-06-13,EBAY,0.0478295162320137,0.9210004210472107,0.031170133501291275

Ebay,Newbie with questions about some of my recently sold (but unpaid) items.,"I recently sold 2 video games, but haven't received payments for them and want some advice.

The first I sold like 5 days ago to someone with lots of positive feedback. I normally receive payments pretty quickly. I sent an invoice and an email reminding him of the purchase in case he/she forgot or something, but I still haven't received a reply in the past few days. This guy has been a member for a while and has a lot of good feedback so I'm sure there's no bad intentions, but I still need to be paid. How long should I wait before opening an unpaid item case?

My second item was sold to someone in India, even though I have chosen to only ship to the United States. The seller has only had an account for a month or so and has no feedback. What should I do about this?

Ebay,"Am I being scammed? Seller says package got delivered to wrong address, but will be rerouted. It is a $5k item.","I bought something on ebay from a seller who doesnt have any selling reputation. I saw afterwards that the description including pictures were copied exactly from a different listing.
The seller now sent me an email saying the package was accidently delivered to the wrong address, but the carrier will reroute and it can take 8 days. I tracked the package that he gave me it was delivered to the same city as me. And was shipped the day I bought the product. However, he only sent me the tracking info after the package said it was delivered.
The next funny thing is that the package shipped from the US, while his ebay profile shows he is from turkey.

Should I contest the charge and open a ebay case now already or wait? The item is more then $5K.

Ebay,ebay store question - book related,"I am going to let my kids thin the herd a bit of my book collection.

Do first editions, older and/or signed books going to fit under one of the approved ""collectible"" catagories, and therefore be eligible for a free listing?

Ebay,"Buyer scammed me, ebay refunded him - help!","My boys broke my TV (beware lightsabres :) and I decided to sell the insurance replacement and upgrade.

It was brand new and unopened and listed as such. I took photos of the box identified with my username and the date. I stated on the description that if the box was damaged, the buyer should refuse delivery and I would refund when I got it back.

Sale went through no problem so I sent using the PayPal offered carrier (parcelforce) with insurance and bought my upgrade.

Buyer emailed me to say he had received it and everything looked OK but he was going to save opening it until he had moved into his new place. Seemed reasonable at the time.

3 weeks later, he messages me to say when he opened it (before moving to new place) the screen was damaged. I checked with carrier what to do to claim but despite taking my money for it, they don't insure flat TV's.

Gutted, but not buyers fault so with a heavy heart, I told him to package it up and send it back to me. I explained that the insurance wouldn't cover it but that I would still honour the refund.

When it got back to me, I knew immediately that it was not the same box as a big sticker was missing and a couple of small tears in the box (all of which had been photographed before sending).

I was livid that despite me telling someone that I would have to pay for it out of my own pocket, that someone would still try to scam me. I immediately filed the photos on the resolution centre and explained to eBay that the packaging was not the original and I suspected that neither was the TV inside, all done as an appeal. I did not contact the buyer as I was too mad. In hindsight, this was a bit stupid.

Despite appeals and me telling eBay not to refund him until we had had a chance to discuss it further (which they said they would not do until it was all resolved), eBay refunded him, explaining to me that as he had returned *a* TV, they had no choice.

Now they're chasing me for their money back. I've emailed them and explained that it was not received in the original packaging as instructed, the serial number from this box had been ripped off,  the damage to the screen clearly was caused by something hitting it (there is an impact point and the damage radiates out from it but there is no damage to the box it was returned in).

Obviously (to me, anyway) the guy has had a TV like mine, broken it during a move and scammed me to get it replaced for free.

Ebay are now chasing me for repayment of the money they returned to him. I completely ignored all contact from Akinika as they have a rep on the internet for being bullies and on principal, I'm really pissed with them for refunding when they told me they wouldn't.

I'm all for buyer protection and stuff, I've got (had, now suspended) 299 feedback at 100% and have always been honourable with buyers and sellers alike but it pisses me off that they're not affording me the same protection or courtesy of even discussing it (an email I sent to the CEO was ignored).

Now its gone to some solicitors called Wright Hassall or something and I can no longer ignore them I don't think.

Has anybody got any advice that can help?

Ebay,"I'm a first time seller, and I'm getting scammed.","So I sold an HP Photosmart A512 on EBay. I got married in 2010 and stored a lot of gifts in secured storage. I am now getting divorced so I'm selling them on eBay. One of the items was a HP Photosmart A512, a little outdated but selling for ~180 on Amazon. Needing a quick sale, I put it up for 65 with 10 shipping. Within minutes of the notification it was bought, I packed it up and sent it USPS. Shipping weight: 6 lbs 2 oz. weight of the printer, ~ 4 lbs, plus the request of being double boxed, plus packing peanuts added, seems reasonable. I paid 17 bucks out front in shipping and have the receipt from USPS. The buyer has several comments from a ""bad buyer"" website, with several concerns from other sellers, all dealing with printers. What should I do? I even listed an  item afterwards consisting of a stainless steel utensil set, found an extra box of the item while going through my storage and decided to just send the extra one to them, even though they paid $40 just for one. I was greeted with a ""God bless you"". Not trying to scam anyone. If he sent the printer back, I'd even pay the return shipping and just try Amazon. But he claims it wasn't sent. Am I screwed from forever selling because of this buyer? Will eBay accept the forum post about the buyer from other first time printer sellers? Thanks. The item was marked received in delivery.

Ebay,Buyer filed false SNAD i need help!!!!,"Hi guys, sorry if my formatting is wrong, feel free to correct me.

So basically I posted a few weeks ago about a buyer that was claiming for non-receipt however I had tracking info to prove otherwise and now my worst nightmare has happened.

The buyer contacted me saying they had not received their xbox but had got a birthday card instead. What happened was that I had accidentally sent a card to the buyers address which I was sending on the same day (which has nothing to do with the xbox)  aswell as the xbox. I then looked up the xbox tracking info and found it had been delivered. 

The buyer opened a case of item not delivered as soon as I questioned them on this and did the same on paypal too. 

I then uploaded the tracking info for the xbox that had the buyers signature too and the buyer immediately changed their paypal case to a Significantly Not As Described claim stating “I received a card”. 

The buyer is using my mistake of sending a card and the item to claim their money. This is obvious as they changed their case to snad as soon as they saw I had proof the xbox was delivered and that they would lose. 

My questions are: 
1) is there any way for me to win this paypal snad case as I cannot afford to lose my money?

2) is there any way at least for me to keep the money I rightfully earned while the buyer is refunded also?

Thanks for any advice i'm so sick of scumbag buyers abusing the protection system.

Ebay,Selling limits on new accounts (UK),"Started a new business and already have a personal business account with £49k per month listing limits and have a partnership with something ridiculous like £200-400k limits which we never reach.

I did the upgrade through ebay where you can verify your older account with your new account to get higher limits. Needless to say I am pretty disappointed to have got 100 items/£3.5k per month.

Does anyone know how long this lasts for? I am aware you can call once per month to request higher limits. I don't know if I am making this up, but from memory when I first started on ebay I had 100 items/3.5k for the first 3 months before I was able to get higher limits? If this isn't true will I just be able to request higher in July?

If what i've suggested is true, does this start from the date of the accounts registration, first sale, or something else completely different? Also, I assume June will count as a single month? even though we are half way through and this is not a rolling calculation like feedback.

Ebay,How to protect my sale; is something fishy here?,"I am a noob when it comes to ebay. I don't sell much--the most I've sold is a pair of Oakleys, an Xbox360, and I just sold a used laptop yesterday.

I had a posting up for a fixed price purchase. I sold the item yesterday; however, the buyer then sent me a request for an invoice. I'm familiar with what an invoice is--however, I found it odd what he asked me to include also:

&gt; Hello, I already won your item on eBay and before payment is completed,i request the below further information: 1.Please send me your ITEM NUMBER just to be sure am making payment to the right person. 2.Send me pictures of the item to my below email just for confirmation and also about present condition of the item. 3.Please send me your PayPal email or send me a PayPal invoice from your paypal account to my PayPal email ID (*redacted PayPal email*)

I don't understand why he'd ask for information that is clearly included when he purchased the item. He should already have the ability to send me a PayPal payment, clearly he has the item number, and there were 11 pictures in the item posting--don't know why he wants more pictures. I should note, that he hasn't paid yet (although I only sent the invoice to him a couple hours ago).

But he continued to complain. 

The day the the DVD was suppose to arrive came and went and was a few days late I assumed the DVD had already arrived but he messaged me complaining and said he would have drove his tractor down to FL and picked it up himself if he would have known it would take this long. 

I knew it should have been there by now so I fillied a usps claim and told him what I did and continued to give him updates and today the DVD finally showed up in his state and after I sent him a long email telling him how we were on the same team and how I would make this right and he responds saying ""we are not on the same team you were the one who went to the post office and said I wanna shop this the slowest way possible I'm going to leave you negative feedback cause this is the worst eBay transaction I have ever had"" 

Let me remind you I did not ship this DVD out the slowest way I ever gave him free shipping, was the cheapest available and shipped same day. 

Here is my question for anyone who is still reading after all of that. If he leaves me a negative feedback is there a good enough case for me to have it removed? This was not fault and did everything to the best of powers.  Or do you think he is just trying to get a free DVD in exchange for scaring me with a negative?",11,2,2015-06-17,EBAY,0.07376623153686523,0.8941295146942139,0.032104186713695526
Ebay,"The 60 day feedback has past, I still haven't received the original OR the resent item. What do I do?","So to elaborate a bit, I bought an item on the 13th Feb. I paid via PayPal, but as a guest. So I don't believe they could offer me a refund. Correct me if I'm wrong.

It was shipped and was due to arrive at my house the by the 24th Feb. 

On 18th March, it still had not arrived, so I messaged the seller. We had a conversation, basically they asked me to wait longer. Trying to be the friendly buyer that I am, I did wait.

In that time, I contacted Australia Post about my missing item. It was ""in transit"" since the 16th Feb. Aus Post said there was nothing they could do, and that I should contact the seller. I did contact the seller but they didn't seem at all interested in contacting Aus Post for me.

On 12th April, the seller resent the item (also offered a refund, but I chose the resend option).

It is currently 17th June, nothing has arrived. Up until now, I have asked the seller why the second item has not arrived. They would not provide me with a tracking number, and multiple times told me to keep waiting. They also did not reply to two of my messages.

I have just sent them another message, this time asking for a full refund because neither have arrived. Hopefully they reply, but if not, I want to know if there's anything I can do about getting my money back.

I wish I wasn't trying to be a friendly customer, because I feel like I got pushed around. I waited when they asked me to wait, and I feel like they got to ""wait"" past the 60 day feedback period then stopped replying to my messages.

Please help, is there anything I can do? The item was $57 and I really can't afford to just say goodbye to that money.

Ebay,Fraudulent buyer abusing protection need help,"Hi guys so I've made a couple of other posts about a buyer who has opened a snad claiming I sent a card and not the Xbox she paid for, which is untrue as the tracking info shows the Xbox is delivered. 

She opened first an item not received claim in both PayPal and eBay and then changed the PayPal claim to snad when she saw I had tracking. 

The ebay INR case is still open and I have the option to get customer services involved. I have no doubt if I do that I will win the ebay case as I have proof of delivery, so really my question is this

If I won the ebay item not received case could I then phone paypal and make them aware of this and they would close the SNAD in my favour or would closing the ebay case in my favour not affect the outcome of paypals case??

I call them up, the guy I spoke with was extremely understanding and even apologetic about the situation, he put me on hold for a moment, checked the tracking number, and came back on the line to let me know he had deleted the negative feedback.

This surprised me as I hadn't sold seriously on Ebay  since they stopped allowing sellers to leave negative feedback and when I called up I was completely expecting them to tell me ""to bad deal with it"".

Now with the pay to list but get a refund of it sells -- I feel like I'm lowering my starting prices super low just so they'll sell and I won't have to pay the .30 fee. Plus the stuff that doesn't sell is adding up quickly. 

I do not relist anymore... I am sitting on a large pile of inventory waiting for a free listing promotion. (The $10 final value fee cap promotion really annoyed me as I never have items over $100.) 

I'm considering now listing buy-it-now's with best offers - paying .30 for 30 days rather than possibly paying .30 weekly (and may or may not get a refund) seems like it makes more sense now?

Ebay,Global Shipping Program Fees?,"I'm considering enrolling in the GSP program. I understand the general idea:
-buyer purchases item and pays eBay for shipping/customs fees
-eBay pays regular item price to you
-you ship to the domestic shipping center

So let's say I have a $20 item, free shipping, which weighs 4oz. I pay ~$2.10 to ship it First Class. It's a 9% final value fee on my item normally. Are there any other fees that I'm missing?

""Your final value fee is based on the final price of the item, shipping charges to the US shipping center, and any other amounts you may charge the buyer. Sales tax is not included.""
Does this mean that even if I have free shipping, eBay takes a percentage of what I paid to ship to them?

Part 2 of the question: How much is the buyer paying on shipping (putting customs fees aside)? Is it more than they normally would be?

Ebay,How much of a chance do I stand?,"In the process of clearing out some old stuff I put an old 2009 MBP I inherited on eBay. Inside it had pretty extensive liquid damage, yet I was able to get some signs of life out of it (HDD spins, RAM works fan spins etc.). 

eBay title: Apple MacBook Pro 13.3"" Laptop - MB991LL/A (June, 2009) For parts - No HDD	
Description: Unit has severe water damage. Fans and HDD spin up, RAM working, but screen is broken. Case has one dent on bottom panel and rubber gasket around screen is cracked.

Some guy paid $100 for it, as well as $45 international shipping. I was somewhat skeptical and about to warn him, but noticed that he had a business buying and repairing old Macs, so I figured he knew what he was getting. He also was quite insistent that I marked the item as 'Returned' on the customs form so he wouldn't have to pay import tax.

Long story short, he's complaining that there's no HDD, the damage inside was caused by coffee, not water, some screws are stripped, and that there's no way he can repair it.

Everything he complained about was either in the title or description, minus the screws and coffee. Given I wrote 'severe water damage', am I covered for it actually being coffee (unbeknownst to me)? I feel like my description did a pretty good job of conveying that the unit is in a dire condition (ie. *severe* water damage). The screws are something that I honestly forgot to include in the description - however I don't feel like they justify the full item + shipping refund he is threatening me with. My initial thought was to just call it $25 and refund him the rest - but the way he has presented himself throughout this entire process (nothing but demanding and aggressive) honestly makes me reluctant.

Ebay,"Suspended because my account was hacked, what do I do?","About me: I buy stuff from ebay infrequently and have sold a couple items more than 5 years ago.

A day after that I got another email from them asking me to change my password and another day after that it says my account got suspended indefinitely for security concerns.

I did find out that someone (not me) listed an item on April 11.

In any case I didn't act on it at the time. I tried calling customer service today and they said I can't do anything to reinstate my account and can't use ebay anymore. In that case why leave it suspended and not close it then. Do I have any hope to get my account reinstated? I don't seem to see a customer service email either just a phone number.

Ebay,eBay requiring UPC's (product identifiers) on new items scares me - it's seemingly to mimic Amazon's catalog system and that only benefits larger sellers,"Now I'm just speculating as to where this will lead us, but I would bet money that I'm right with what I'm going to say.

eBay has long just copied Amazon with many of the things they do and changes they implement.

Look at what happened with Amazon once they started to require UPC codes. All of the products using that UPC code got listed within the same listing. You no longer had your own unique listing. Everything is cataloged and a buyer has to click on the '46 New From $8.99' link before they are even presented with the option of purchasing from you. Good luck winning the Buy Box if you're not a HUGE seller.

This will happen at eBay and it already does to some extent. You'll simply be one of many sellers selling the same items on eBay within a single listing. Your sales can be affected by other sellers entering in the wrong information or entering in the wrong pictures. It's happened with me on Amazon. Lost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, because one seller uploaded the wrong picture and we had tons of sales before the mistake was caught. Amazon doesn't give a fuck about this. They didn't refund our money or take away the negatives or defects on our account. No reason to think eBay will be any different as we all have experience with eBay and this sort of thing.

The countless hours I've put into my listings, especially my variation listings with hours of keyword research and years of learning how to best sell an item on eBay will be useless. Hell, I've discovered ways to maximize keywording on items that I've never seen implemented by **any** other seller on eBay. And if they switch it up on us for new products, all of that will be gone. None of my work will matter. I won't be able to compete with the larger companies that decide to sell the products I carry at a stupidly low cost with hardly any profit just to drive me out of the market. It happens on Amazon. They're selling products below my cost and they have free Prime shipping. Even though I am way better at putting together a listing and displaying my product, I stand 0 chance on Amazon because any listing I create that has a UPC code, and they're now required, just gets tossed in with the rest of them and my price is too high to ever get a sale.

The one difference between eBay and Amazon is that Amazon will actually take all of that cataloged information, see an item is selling well and then they'll start selling the item themselves. They take all of the work all of the other sellers did and now use it for themselves and are able to beat everyone's price and offer a better and faster shipping method for no additional cost. I can't see eBay doing this, but if they switch to a site wide catalog system on brand new items, it won't really matter because a company like Buy.com will start doing it.

A change like this seems like it sucks because you have to buy the UPC codes and start putting them in listing by listing and that takes time and extra money to buy the UPC codes, but this implementation is just a peek at the future of eBay and what it means for many of us smaller seller's that do this on the side for extra income or have a small company with a few employees. I've just started to really pick up steam on eBay and have a nice and steady flow of extra income each month, but at this point I don't think it's something that will last in the long term because of eBay's undying need to copy Amazon.",14,13,2015-06-23,EBAY,0.09401718527078629,0.8813516497612,0.024631191045045853

Ebay,How strict will eBay be on New Required Product Identifiers - Barcodes,"We list 10's of thousands of listings on Ebay UK and US (.com) and are a little concerned with the new rules coming into force shortly. (Product Identifiers will soon become a requirement).


We use a drop-shipping company to sell pretty much all of our products but the problem is that we arent able to get Barcodes from supplier nor are they going to offer this in the near future.


We literally add 1000's of new SKU per month to our database and then list these on to eBay.


Its not possible to get a hold of each and every product to get the Barcode and then put this into our database.


We subscribe to GS1 Barcode and therefore our membership gives us a few thousand barcodes. We are thinking of purchasing tens of thousands of new barcodes and then simply applying these to each SKU.


Mind you that the Barcodes wont be the actual Barcodes issued to that particular product. 


e.g. A Pair of Nike runners will already have a pre-designated barcode from NIKE themselves but as we wont be able to get this barcode easily my idea was to issue a new one from our list of barcodes and then simply upload it into Ebay.


Does anyone have any information on the consequences of doing this? Would ebay have the capabilities to find out if we were to use incorrect barcodes?


Its just that we are stumped and dont know how to proceed with this and cant think of any other solution.

Ebay,"Unjustly ""Dear John'd"". What are my options?","I'll try to keep this story as short as possible, but it's a lengthy issue that stretches back nearly 5 months. I came onto eBay with the goal of selling games and gaming accessories (no Hank Hill pun intended). I amounted a good bit of feedback, 27 positive in total (24 recorded due to a repeat buyer within a week), with absolutely 0 negatives. Things were looking up, and eBay was becoming a fun little hobby. I started getting into going to yardsales, collecting more inventory, refurbishing, and the like to start moving bigger and better inventory. I even had ideas for other niche markets that I wanted to tap into. This was cut short however by the storm ""Juno"". 

  For anyone who lives anywhere close to the New England area, you'll know what I mean. The blizzards were crazy, snow rising as high as 8, even 9 feet in some areas. I was one of these affected areas, and my post office made that clear. There was a point where mail didn't come for nearly 2 weeks, and another where they completely closed, halting all shipping in and out of the area. At the same time, my eBay sales were still taking off. I was left with a choice; keep the current sales at the expense of my customers waiting until the storm blew over (which I swear it never would with how bad it got, and how bad it continued to get), or contact those buyers, let them know the situation, and refund them their orders with a thank you for their understanding and cooperation. 

  I got the go ahead, and did this. Of course being a new eBay seller, I did this incorrectly and cancelled the sales myself, instead of having the buyer do so. This led to a whole boatload of defects (7, to be exact) and was a huge scar on my seller rating. I tried to contact eBay support for some understanding, but they couldn't do anything, and it was at this point that my outlook was bleak. I was left with a 25% defect rating due to my low number of sales at the time, even though my completed ones were handled perfectly and I received positives across the board. I tried to come back, but it was impossible with how eBay handled their DSR. Anything above 5% defects is considered Below Standard, and being Below Standard for a certain period of time gets your account restricted from selling at all. It was impossible for me to bring my rating down due to the high percentages, and inevitably, I was restricted. 

  I tried to contact eBay, and they said they'd let me appeal the restriction the my account. I sent logs of weather reports detailing the conditions, records of how high the snow was in areas, and I even sent them link to sites detailing the closings of the local post office on the EXACT day I had to cancel my current sales and refund the buyers, leading to those defects. Of course, this wasn't enough for eBay support, or at the very least they didn't care, because after a week with no response and having to contact them two times, I was met with this response ""We did receive your appeal however after reviewing your account I do not see that any defects were removed, and that would be a valid appeal reason"". So, whoever responded confirmed that I had a valid reason to appeal, but yet the defects won't be removed? I don't understand these policies, and I'm becoming increasingly annoyed with how my situation is being handled. As much as eBay would like to think I can control the incliment weather, I sadly am not a god and have no such power. I tried to do right by my customers and refund them, knowing I wouldn't be able to meet deadlines and not wanting them to have to wait an exorbitant amount of time for the items they bought. What are my options here? Should I continue to press for an appeal until eBay can help me with this situation, or should I just take my business elsewhere?",3,2,2015-06-24,EBAY,0.10324109345674515,0.868865966796875,0.027892930433154106
Ebay,Possible eBay scam?,"Hi r/eBay! 

Could this message from a seller be some sort of scam? Or an attempt to bait me into some sort of feedback extortion? 


Dear UrArsenal, 

We really apologize for the failure in our system, causing you to have to go through all this inconvenience about our product, and we really value our customers, may I offer you the product you had purchased, and that has been refunded for free, in exchange of just the removal of the negative review?)
Please let us know, 
Again, our apologies and thank you, 

Back story:

I paid for and bought an item for $80. Paid via PayPal right after I bought the item. A couple days pass and no Delivered notice via eBay so I email the seller who doesn't reply. Doesn't reply to two additional emails.  Fast forward through eBay complaint and eventually getting PayPal payment refund and leaving negative feedback. Other sellers who bought same item have also left negative feedback for a total of 3 negative feedbacks. 


My knee jerk reaction was to reply with, ""I'll remove the negative when the item arrives."" Then I got suspicious of their offer and have not replied yet. 

What are your thoughts?",12,2,2015-06-24,EBAY,0.0721639096736908,0.8945788145065308,0.03325726091861725
Ebay,Bought the wrong item. Haven't sent payment yet. Seeking order cancellation.,"Approximately 38 hours ago my wife and I were browsing for some new shoes when we decided to look for some on ebay. After first selecting women's shoes then athletic and finally my wife's shoe size a pair of shoes came up that my wife liked. Since the auction was nearly ending and the price was reasonable, my wife bid and 20 minutes later she won. 

After winning the auction, we checked the listing again and realized the shoes were the wrong size. I know we should have known better and looked more carefully before bidding but we both assumed the shoes would be correctly sized since my wife selected her size from the left size of her screen before she found them. We noticed this problem with the shoe size just before I was going to press the pay button to complete the transaction.

I quickly sent the seller a message explaining what happened and requesting that they cancel the order. I have yet to receive a reply although I do see in the fine-print of their listing that they claim they will reply to any messages within 24-48 hrs and that they want to have satisfied customers and positive feedback.

Looking at the seller's return policy for this item I see two things.

1. They have a 14-day return policy. It seems like if I wanted to pay for the item, once I receive it I can just turn around and send it back for the refund, this would be one ""solution,"" although I would have to pay for shipping both ways since shipping for this item isn't free. 

2. The seller wants to charge a 10% ""re-stock"" fee for returns. I think that since I haven't paid for the item and they haven't shipped it it, I shouldn't have to pay this fee.

If I'll be needing to pay for 2-way shipping on top of a 10% cost of the item ""re-stocking"" fee that's going to add up to just over 50% of the cost of the item. &lt;Insert joke about buying one single shoe here&gt;

Ideally, I just want the seller to cancel the order so that they can sell the shoes to another customer who actually wants them. Who knows? They may even be able to sell it for a higher price the next time around. I don't know if that's likely, but it's still well within the realm of possibility.

Maybe the seller will end up replying to my message within the next several hours and this issue will be resolved.

I just wanted to hear from some experienced people that know about things like this.

What are some reasonable expectations about what will happen? Do I have any right to expect this order to be cancelled? Is it somehow not our fault since the wrong-sized shoes came up after we selected another size in our search? Should I contact ebay customer service and if I did what would they say?


UPDATE: 

Seller has opened unpaid item case. I think if I refuse to pay for the item, which I think for now is the prudent thing to do, the seller will cancel the order.

Looks like I'll soon have a meaningless unpaid item strike against my account? Is this really inconsequential (historically I've always paid orders promptly) and if not how/when can I get it removed?

Ebay,"Seller may have sold me stolen goods (camera with serial number scratched off), won't admit it, now wants me to upload pics to 'prove it'","I bought a camera from ebay last week, described as ""Very well looked after, always kept in a case"" and the pics showed absolutely no signs of wear and tear.  
  
After it arrived, i opened the package to inspect, then noticed that the serial number had been scratched off/ground off (from the underside of the camera), which made me very suspicious. No pics of the underside were included in the item listing, and with it being described as ""Very well looked after, always in a case"", and he also has a 100% feedback rating. So i had a reasonable expectation that the camera would not arrive with purposeful damage like that...  
  
There's no wear on any other part of the underside (which was shown in his pics), but there is definitely purposeful damage on the 2-cm area where the serial number should be. It's completely stripped off the aluminium.   
  
I got in touch with the seller, who was aggressive in his reply, blaming the lack of serial number on ""Are you kidding? It's from general wear and tear, the camera is 3 years old, what do you expect?"" which I feel doesn't quite match the item listing ""Very well looked after, always kept in a case"".     
  
And after further correspondence including asking for a return, now he is changing his replies to say ""I never knew it was damaged in the first place, maybe you did it.""  
  
Now he's asking me to email pics (not through the eBay messaging, but to his personal email) of the damage from different angles for ""closer inspection"". Is he trying to trap me?

I've been in this situation before, and I know I will probably win this case, but I was just wondering - should I even bother commenting on the case?

I was wondering how best to proceed with this transaction I had made on eBay.  I purchased the item in question on June 20th.  I immediately paid and thought nothing of it.  However, according to eBay, the transaction is still pending.  When I log into PayPal, it says that the payment is unclaimed and that I can cancel it if I wish.

Ebay,Is this a common shady tactic on bidding?,"I was watching an auction for the past several days, scheduled to end today. The same item had sold for about $500 over the last few weeks, and I was thinking of putting in a bid for that amount to see if I would get lucky and be the highest bidder.

As of last night, the auction was at $525, slightly more than how much it had sold for recently, and how much I was willing to pay, so I said ""meh, done with that auction"". I suspect other potential bidders likely did the same.

Fur curiosity, I came back today to see what it went for, and saw that the item sold $405, way lower than any of the recent auctions, and lower than it was last night.

Looking at the bid history, the winning bidder had a history of bids. However, it looks like 3 accounts sharply escalated the bidding from the then-price of $400, up to $500 --&gt; $520 --&gt; $525. As a result of those bids pushing the auction price above what the item was worth (based on recent auctions), no one bid afterwards for the entire last day of the auction.

Then... all 3 of those bids were cancelled in the last minute of the auction, and the price went back to $405.

So if you're the winning bidder, that (using fake bids to make the price seem high, then drop last minute when the bids are cancelled) would be a way to keep the price low. Not only would it ""scare off"" potential bidders like me from bidding (I would have bid $500), but it actually prevents us from doing so since I can't bid less than the then-current price of $525.

Clearly, I wouldn't have won the auction in this case since it is less than the eventual winning bidder's max (which was at least $525), but it seems like a dishonest way to game the system and get a far lower price by using multiple accounts to make fake bids as a buyer.

Am I interpreting this correctly, and is this common?

Ebay,*SIGH! * ... I think I got a fake hair of headphones,"On June 22nd I ordered from eBay for the first time, a pair of Beats Solo 2 Wireless headphones from a seller that had 100% feedback from over 50 purchases, for $240, no box, no refunds. I received them on Friday. After confirming that they work I left positive feedback, but as I went to register them, I noticed that there was no serial number on them, only three numbers on the left extension. Not where they're supposed to be. 

I messaged the seller today asking if he had access to the SN and he responded pretty quickly and told me he didn't, and that the numbers on the left is what I should need. I'm pretty sure that a serial number is not just 3 numbers. So I'm pretty sure I've bought fakes, the issue is I'm torn on if the seller knows this and how they'll react. 

How should I proceed?

BTW: the seller has sold multiple beats headphones before mine


UPDATE 1: I messaged the seller this morning telling him that 3 numbers are not a serial number, and that all authentic Beats headphones have one. Depending on his response, I'll open up a case this afternoon

UPDATE 2: The seller is adamant that 3 digits are legit. So to give him the benefit of the doubt, I'm going to take the headphones to my local Apple Store and compare them to the displays.

Ebay,User Information Request from a (possibly) shady seller? Can this hurt me in any way?,"Hi /r/ebay


I recently bid on an item on eBay and was lucky enough to win. I was very ecstatic, but after paying and looking over the account I started to become nervous that this person's only intention may be to scam someone. They're account was made this month and they had listed multiple high value items (around or over $100 each) which will be shipped from Japan. 


Well I just received an email from the seller requesting my information (I believe this will give them my phone number and email address?). Maybe I'm paranoid, but it started to seem shady to me that they needed this. Should I give them the information, should I not respond, should I contact eBay? What can they do with the information anyways? 



Any help/advice is appreciated! 



EDIT: I just checked and see no information of the request on my eBay account, only in my email. Not sure if that's normal. 


TL;DR: Brand new account was selling multiple high value items internationally. I won one, and now the seller is requesting my contact information. Should I be worried, should I give it to them?

Ebay,When to request a refund?,"Hi,

I recently autobought a pair of shoes from a seller on eBay, located in Russia, with 7 ratings. I figured that in the case this went south, I'd be able to get my money back, so I gave it a shot because the shoes were priced cheap, but not overly so.

The seller says in the item description that the shoes will ship ""between 3-5 days"", and the item says it will be shipping from China. It's been about a week and they have not been marked as shipped. I contacted the seller asking what's up and he hasn't replied -- the sale was made on the 22nd.

I understand that products shipping from China can take up to a month to arrive and that's not a problem.. however, if he's not going to ship them out for this long, when should I request a refund? Should I wait a month and see if he just forgot to mark them as shipped? (This has occurred recently with something else I purchased from another seller, and they eventually arrived.)

I'm just wondering if I wait a month, will that go past the dispute time frame and I'll be SOL on my $40. Would eBay give me a refund?

Ebay,I think something fishy is going on.,"Recently had an item up for sale as a buy it now. The buyer emailed me asking for my paypal email and so I replied. It had sold and got an email from PayPal saying I had received a payment of said amount. So I shipped the item assuming that since I'm a new seller I wouldn't get my money until positive feedback is left or after 21 days. So after shipping the item and marking it as shipped the buyer messages me through eBay and asks if I can do overnight shipping to said address. I told him I had already shipped it and it will be there accordingly (I had free shipping listed in my post). He then replied and wanted me to stop the shipping and change the address to a different one not listed under his eBay account. I did not do this after calling eBay and they said to not change the address. So the shipping continues. The thing is, the buyer did not email me through eBay but instead used my paypal email to try and contact me while I kept replying through eBay because then they can see it if something is going on. But just today I received my box back all battered and dented but the items where still inside. So I log into eBay to contact buyer and it says the item has not been paid for. And I thought I had already gotten an email saying it was paid for so I check my email and the email I got was not from my trusted paypal email service but it said it was from the same email. Service@paypal.com and it was just not the same trusted email that I've received many emails from before. So now I have the item and it is unpaid I'm curious as to what's going on here if he tried to scan me with changing the address?? And since I didn't do so did he give up?

Ebay,How Should I deal with this seller?,"Alright so I bought 2 offbrand PS2 controllers off of a seller on ebay last week and on friday the package arrived.  When I opened it (It was just a fedex bubble mailer with the controller in the plastic packaging inside) I found out that 1. The right bumper on the controller was broken off, probably because of the poor packing job.  And more importantly 2. There was no second controller.  The packaging wasn't big enough to hold 2 controllers so it looks like they just didnt notice the ""quantity 2"".  Well I messaged them trying to be nice asking what I should do since the controller I got was broken and they totally forgot about the second one.  I did include a picture of the damage to the controller as well (and I haven't opened the plastic packaging the controller came in still).  They responded a few hours later asking for more pictures and I sent some more.  Then I didn't hear back and figured it was too late (around 4:30 central on friday) and expected to hear back from them latest mid day today, monday, since some companies don't work over the weekend.  Well I didn't hear from them so around 3:00 I sent a reminder that I still needed help with my situation but still haven't heard back.  Do I have ebay step in at this point or how many more days do I give them?  At this point I don't even want the controllers but am willing to accept 2 working ones or a refund, is that unreasonable?
