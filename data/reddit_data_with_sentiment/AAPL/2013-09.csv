apple,Phishing attempt on Apple ID,"**Just posting this as a warning in case anyone else has received similar. If you have, then beware - it's not genuine**

Anyway, I've just received an email claiming to be from Apple and stating :-

*""This is an automatic message sent by our security system to let you know that you have 48 hours to confirm your account information.*

*Your itunes account has been frozen because we are unable to validate your account information.""*

It's trying to send me to a site called applestoreverfied.com to type in my apple id and password, which looks like a valid Apple page, but was registered yesterday by someone who is quite clearly not Apple ([whois record](http://whois.domaintools.com/applestoreverfied.com) if anyone's interested).

Will it work well or be a problem?

I've noticed for some time that few people I know use the Emacs-inspired family of shortcuts. Most people know *Command+a* but few people I interact with know about ctrl+a.

For example while typing this message, if I don't like this line, I can quickly type ctrl+a to reach the beginning and then ctrl+k to kill the line, *without* deleting the text I had written above. 

It gets even nicer if you change Caps lock to be Control in your Keyboard preferences.  Then your fingers don't have to stray far from home row to, say, delete some characters (ctrl+d) or to move to the end of the line (ctrl+e)

- One app per comment. Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.

- Any Apple-made platform. iOS and OS X are both game.
- Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
- Mention what the app does in a sentence or two, and perhaps how you use it.
- Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
- Don't mention Native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc), because everyone knows about them.",76,99,2013-09-08,AAPL,0.027816742658615112,0.9306843280792236,0.041498858481645584

apple,My Predictions for Tomorrow's Event,"**New iPhone Lineup:**

* **iPhone 5C** – 16GB Capacity, multiple colors, free on contract or $450 unlocked. A6 processor, iPhone 4S camera, HD 1.2 front-facing camera, TD-LTE compatible chipset.
* **iPhone 5** – 16GB Capacity Only, white or black – same as today’s iPhone 5 - $99 on contract, $550 unlocked
* **iPhone 5S** – Starting from 32GB Capacity. A7 processor, improved camera (both improvements are fairly incremental), new Gold color option, and fingerprint sensor home button. $199 on contract, $650 unlocked
* Available for Pre-Order 9/13, on sale 9/20

**Fingerprint sensor:**

* Primarily to authorize 1-click iTunes purchases – no more worrying about your kid finding the password, while simultaneously making your own purchases completely frictionless.  Like that song you hear playing on itunes radio? Tap to buy, click to confirm, you’re done.  
* Also ties in with iCloud Keychain.  Authorizes access to your personal information for Auto-Fill on websites,  make purchases in apps that have saved your CC info, etc.  With the Apple Fingerprint Sensor, you never have to type a password or your personal information in twice, ever again.  

**Game controllers:**

* On-Stage demos of a handful of some core and some casual games highlighting a few hardware partners who have controller accessories ready to go – some are dedicated controllers, some are controller cases, potentially some ‘hybrid’ controllers that are standalone but can snap apart and snap to the side of an iPad turning an iPad into a Wii-U GamePad (I’m expecting these won’t show up until the iPad event)
* Apple TV update to do something to facilitate gaming there. Not necessarily it’s own app store, at this time games might only run via AirPlay streaming or something, but there will be *something* about gaming on the Apple TV even if it’s just AirPlay from an iPhone or iPad w/ a controller. 
* Actually the Apple TV demo will probably be showing off how the controller API's support up to 4 controllers, and they will do a split-screen demo with four people playing on an AppleTV maybe.
* Pricing and availability of controllers, which will go on sale the same day as iOS 7 is released

**AppleTV software update:**

* I don’t *think* there will be new hardware but you never know. Instead I expect a pretty significant software update that ties in with iCloud Keychain and allows you to take any authorized iOS device and authorize an Apple TV just by ‘tapping’ them together.  Meaning if you want to watch HBO GO on your Apple TV after bringing it home, and you’ve already authorized the app on your iPhone, you can just tap your iPhone to the Apple TV, and you can watch HBO GO.  It will probably be a single process at initial setup of the Apple TV that transfers all your credentials at once.  It will be a *really* cool feature.
* May also announce additional TV content channels coming this fall including CW and possibly NFL

**iOS 7**

* Releases on 9/18 for iPhone, not iPad, 2 days before the new iPhones go on sale. 
* Major new feature: iBeacons, BTLE API stack that allow developers to create amazing ways for your phone to interact with other phones and the real world. Watch for the tear-jerking video next WWDC of the blind guy whose life was changed by iBeacons, TILE, and amazing apps being developed today. 
* Not available for iPad quite yet – not sure how universal binary updates are going to work for apps that require iOS 7, could be a bit messy.

iphone,iPhone 5S STILL starts at 16GB for $199 (w/ contract). This is ridiculous.,"This 16GB starting point hasn't changed since the iPhone 4 and it's increasingly unusable as these storage-heavy features and apps continue to come out.  

This is freakin' ridiculous.  With storage so cheap, it's more than that; it's an insult.

Am I a lone crazy-person for having this reaction, or does anyone else agree?

**Edit the first**: Additional note, starting with 16GB seems to undercut the flagship 'premium' concept of the phone.  

**Edit 2**: I've taken a couple of repeated questions and answered them here to help save time.  

A common recurring question is variants of  ""What could take up so much space that you'd need more than 16GB on your phone?  640K ought to be enough for anybody as evidenced by my 8GB iPhone 3GS and the fact that I've never run out of space!""  Ok, that's just a little snarky, but it's not entirely double plus unaccurate as you'll find if you read the thread.  No, I don't store much music on my phone and I make use of cloud services, but if I'm on a vacation with my family and want to take videos the 16GB is very limiting.  On the iPhone 5, I believe the rough figure for video is just under 200 megabytes per minute.  It's reasonable to expect that the new camera may record at a higher bitrate, but even if it doesn't, that's quite a chomp.  

Also, as a simple cave man trying to understand this complicated world, I struggle to understand how things like these magical devices work.  Is there a little man inside the phone who draws the images on the screen?  Well, according to some people in the thread, this basic lack of understanding (and financial panthering, for that matter, because I must also be destitute) is clearly the only reason I think this is a problem.  Well, I appreciate your candor, folks.  I'm actually an iPhone developer [who writes software for helping accidental time travelers](http://timetravelreference.com/) out so I'm a little unusual already but I do actually understand the technical challenges.  Also, while I professionally develop software elsewhere too, I can understand that having a different opinion on an iPhone design decision from some of the people here could reasonably be seen as evidence that I'm an idiot but that'll just have to be my problem, I guess.  

I hope this thread continues to spark spirited and worthwhile discussion.",829,771,2013-09-10,AAPL,0.0322578065097332,0.9257206320762634,0.04202163591980934

apple,"The M7 chip is a very clever thing, that most people have overlooked.","From Apples website: 

The new M7 coprocessor is like a sidekick to the A7 chip. It’s designed specifically to measure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass — a task that would normally fall to the A7 chip. But M7 is much more efficient at it. Now fitness apps that track physical activity can access that data from the M7 coprocessor without constantly engaging the A7 chip. So they require less battery power.

M7 knows when you’re walking, running, or even driving. For example, Maps switches from driving to walking turn-by-turn navigation if, say, you park and continue on foot. Since M7 can tell when you’re in a moving vehicle, iPhone 5s won’t ask you to join Wi-Fi networks you pass by. And if your phone hasn’t moved for a while, like when you’re asleep, M7 reduces network pinging to spare your battery.

Some of the beginner stuff may feel basic but there are a lot of useful tips on tagging your files for easy search, automation, utilizing smart searches and using the Activity Monitor to your advantage. It took me a while to put together so please share it with your friends, and if you want to support the course I also made a coupon code that makes the course $15. Use it here: **REDDITMAC15**

apple,Results of the iPhone colour poll,"Last night I posted [this survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1mffjl/im_curious_which_iphone_would_you_buy/) here asking people which colour and model iPhone they'd like to get.

First of all I'd like to apologise for the huge delay in getting these results, and more importantly the overall rubbish format of the survey. The information is not as usable as it should have been. Smarter Redditors than I must have been cringing. If I could do it over again and add some demographic information and format the questions to provide more helpful information, I would. Again, I apologise. 

I only made this poll because I spent the entire day agonising over what colour I'd want to get (clearly the problems in my life are quite serious). I thought perhaps seeing what a few other people thought would help me decide. I never expected such a huge response. At the time of posting this over 6,000 people have answered the poll. Mind boggling. ~~I hope the folks at Samsung find this information very helpful.~~

*

***Live results straight from Google can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1koBcRX_k5J4wuntFY_n9i0EkrIWsWc40BvE9zyc3Pf0/viewanalytics)***

*

But because I screwed up the format of the poll, that data might not really be easy to look at. I'll try to make a succinct summary of the data as of the time of writing.


**The 5s**
The replacement for the slate black iPhone 5, space grey, is by and large the most preferred colour. 61% of respondents at the time of writing put it as their first preference. 51% of people put white as their second preference, and 62% of respondents put gold last. 

[Here is a bar chart with the data.](http://i.imgur.com/rRLMYH3.png)

*

**The 5c**
When it comes to the 5C, the results are pretty interesting, and instead of me sitting here pretending to know what I'm doing I'll allow you to draw your own conclusions. I will point out how 31% of respondents put the pink 5c as their number one preference, making it the most preferred, while 39% of respondents also put the pink as their least preferred colour making it one of the least preferred...? As /u/gormster commented, the pink is clearly a polarising colour. In fact, all the colours are quite polarising. I think that's exactly why Apple chose the shades they did.

I predict you'll see a lot of blue and green floating around.

[here is a bar chart with the data.](http://i.imgur.com/BNpPbPc.png)

^A ^note ^in ^regards ^to ^the ^question ^about ^the ^5c: ^I ^do ^realise ^that ^the ^question ^was ^too ^ambiguous ^for ^the ^first ^12 ^hours ^the ^survey ^was ^put ^up, ^and ^I'm ^kicking ^myself ^for ^it. ^Even ^so, ^and ^perhaps ^it's ^me ^being ^optimistic, ^the ^question ^**always** ^stated ^""in ^order ^preference"". ^I ^believe ^for ^most ^people ^1 ^is ^always ^first ^preference ^with ^or ^without ^the ^(much needed, but lacking) ^clarification.

*

In the end, the 5s is significantly more popular than the 5c, and the space grey one is looking to be the most popular.

[Here is a piechart showing the most preferred iPhones overall.](http://i.imgur.com/O97QiRx)

**I have to be completely honest. I don't really know much of what I'm doing when it comes to statistics and data analysis. Any advice on how to better present the information will be greatly appreciated.**

Now you swipe up to access your tool bar

Auto updates are automatically enabled 

Siri can control some settings, to turn down brightness use percentages ""turn down brightness by 10%""

These are just some things I wish I had known before updating, nothing major I just was slightly frustrated

/u/parsable said ""You access Spotlight by swiping down on the launcher, on the icons themselves rather than from the top of the screen as you do to access notification centre.""

/u/kar98_byf42 ""Instead of swiping to the right, you now swipe to the left to delete or move e-mails from your list of e-mails.

And the screen can be unlocked by swiping to the right anywhere on your screen, not just in a narrow bar.

I'm not sure about this, I think I had Bluetooth turned off because no reason to have it on, but after the restart with iOS7 installed, it showed to be turned on when I swiped up to reveal the control center.

Tldr: Bluetooth gets turned on by default, I think.""


/u/timforreal ""In any text message/iMessage thread, pull from right to left and hold to see the timestamp of the messages.""

/u/jcxtreme ""People should mess around with the default apps a little. You may find something that you used to use an older app for, for example, swipe left in the Compass app for a level. Just spend a little bit of time in each one.""

/u/i_am_your_cupcake ""Big one for me. You can block people from calling/messaging you. Settings&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Messages&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Blocked. ""

/u/NotValid ""iOS 7 automatically keeps a history of all the places you go. This is on by default, but can be turned off in Settings &amp;amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;amp;gt; Location Services &amp;amp;amp;gt; System Services &amp;amp;amp;gt; Frequent Locations.""

apple,Some thoughts on iOS 7,"First of all I am not a programmer or developer, I am just a regular person that likes apple products but am not a fanatic about it.

The phrase, ""Apple may be late to the party, but is always the best dressed"" has never rang more true with this update. When they released the new design I immediately panned it thinking apple had lost it. The colors and the design looked cheap to me. I was afraid all of the new enhancements were about catching up to samsung. That didn't stop me from installing it last Wednesday.

I spent most of the day looking through the redesigned apps. Trying to figure out all of the unannounced features. I found myself just staring at the home screen. Today, I spent an hour in the weather app. Then it hit me: what other operating system would a user spend that much time looking at weather?

Say what you will about the new design but after 3 days of using it I am convinced that this is the most beautiful update they have ever released. Once again, I think they have set the gold standard in mobile design.

There have been a lot of people nit-picking. And that's exactly what it is. Apple has set such a perfect standard, with all of their devices, that the most minuscule design or operating flaw makes headlines.

That being said, I still have my hang-ups about the new iOS but, I can't imagine having a better one than this.",512,683,2013-09-21,AAPL,0.03199752792716026,0.9104440808296204,0.05755835026502609

The data usage is rather minimal at 25MB per hour of talk time, but boy does it make a difference. The most stunning application to me has been talking to people in the car over bluetooth. Whereas it used to be a hot mess, especially if both parties were going over 60MPH, with FaceTime Audio, you might as well be sitting next to each other on the couch.

iphone,Getting the longest life out of your iPhone battery.,"I often see many misconceptions about iPhone batteries, and Li-ion batteries in general, so I thought I'd write a mini-guide to address this issue.

iPhones have Lithium ion batteries. All Li-ion batteries have a limited life span, ie a finite number of charge cycles that they can undergo before becoming useless. The number of cycles you can achieve is determined *in part* by how you treat the battery.

The two biggest enemies of Li-ion batteries are heat and over-voltage charging. The latter is mainly taken care of by charger design (ie trickle charging and cutoffs).

Heat is a bigger problem. Batteries get hot when they are charging. Heat is also related to the other big reducer of Li-ion battery lifespan: Deep charge cycles.

Li-ion batteries function optimally and have the longest lifespan when discharged to around 60-80% then charged to full. Full (or deep) discharges* reduce the lifespan of the battery. Full discharges are bad due to intrinsic chemistry (small permanent changes inside the battery reduce its life) and also recharging from a low charge will inevitably heat (causing more permanent chemical changes) the battery more than shorter, more frequent charges.

Often people recommend infrequently fully discharging Li-ion batteries and sometimes even report better life after such treatment. This treatment of batteries is a legacy of times when Ni-Cad batteries were the predominant type and the subsequent conflation with Li-ion technology.

The apparent 'improvement' results *only* from the recalibration of the electronic gauge used to display the remaining battery percentage. Directly gauging a battery's current level of charge is not actually possible. The percentage shown is an average 'expected' value based on previous uses of the battery after being monitored by software for a period of time. If the calibrated values become inaccurate the battery gauge will also be inaccurate. A full discharge will recalibrate the software gauge, often resulting in more accurate battery-level readings. This in no way affects the battery at all. All that happens is the software is more accurate at reporting the estimate charge remaining. You will get no more performance from your batter by doing a full charge even if it appears to be so (actually, by doing a full discharge, you have reduced the lifespan of your battery by a tiny amount). Apple actually recommends infrequent full discharges. My guess is that they see this as a trade off; they know they are reducing the battery life by some tiny amount, but also receive far fewer customer support complaints due to poorly calibrated battery gauges being perceived as faulty devices.

\* For the purposes of this guide a 'full discharge' is defined as reaching around 5-10%. For Li-ion batteries a 'full discharge' is not truly a complete discharge. Li-ion batteries have a cutoff within the battery to prevent complete discharge. If a Li-ion battery is completely discharged it can not be recharged. So when your device containing a Li-ion battery reports the battery is empty this is the cutoff coming into play and preventing permanent damage to the battery. 

**TL;DR**

**DO: Charge frequently. Small, frequent charges are best. Charge your battery first if you are going to leave it unplugged for an extended period. Charge your battery in a cool spot.**

**DO NOT: Let your battery get hot. Fully discharge your battery. Let your battery sit at low charge for extended periods. Believe the lie that full discharges improve battery lifespan.**",87,311,2013-09-24,AAPL,0.1499793529510498,0.8249058723449707,0.025114744901657104

Another was making a TV jammer, and making people believe the odd things they were doing would improve reception (think: standing on one leg with the antenna held up like the statue of liberty's torch).

Hacking his son's computer file system, and making the kid think that his mother was responsible (Steve had her create a folder called ""from mom"" or something similar).

The last one I remember was (re)hack of someone dialing into one of his systems using a illegitimate (and offensively named) account.

apple,iPhone 5S homescreen resizes when returning from multitasking,"Hi everyone,

I was just wondering whether anyone was experiencing this issue.

If you own a 5S, when coming back to the homescreen from multitasking, there is a quick fraction of a second where the screen seems to resize itself (stretches up.) It's really brief, and not too noticeable if you're not paying attention. The easiest way to see it is if you look at the carrier name (Verizon or AT&amp;T) right when you get back to the homescreen.

The funny thing is, this doesn't happen with an iOS 7 upgraded iPhone 5, only on the 5S. Which makes me wonder if it's not a software thing but more of a hardware thing.

It also sometimes happens when coming back to the homescreen from an app.

I've gone around to Verizon, ATT &amp; Apple stores to see if it was just my phone, but all of them seem to have this problem.

This happens regardless of whether the parallax motion is on or off.

On a separate note, the parallax motion seems to be pretty choppy if you move the phone around and stare at the apps.
