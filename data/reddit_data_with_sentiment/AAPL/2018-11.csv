apple,Called Apple to get an education discount for the new iPad Pro. Ended up with them giving me an iPad Folio case for free instead.,"Thought it was a pretty cool customer experience. 

Last night, I called Apple to see if I can still get the education pricing for the new iPad. The rep said that since my payment is being validated that I’m not able to receive a credit. I told him I was planning on getting the Smart Folio case anyways and was hoping for maybe a $50 gift card equivalent for the education discount. 

He ended up just adding the case to my order and shipping it to me completely free! And the case retails for $79. 

I’m pretty stoked. Checked the shipping and it’s getting here the day before my iPad gets here. May not be a big deal to some, but I thought it was pretty cool.

- Steve Jobs when he took over Apple in 1998

I am not trying to cast any judgement on the policies of Apple and it's executives. They are much smarter than I am and are probably there for a very good reason.

apple,The new MacBook Air has a slower GPU than 2015's Air,"Edit: **This is speculation, not 100% confirmed but highly likely.**


New MacBook Air - Intel UHD 617 Graphics

Old MacBook Air - Intel HD 6000 Graphics

The UHD 617 is just a slightly higher-clocked HD 615 with 24 execution units (Gen 9), while the HD 6000 has 48 execution units (Gen 8).

Looking at benchmarks between the HD 615 and HD 6000 (since the UHD 617 hasn't released yet), the old MacBook Air's HD 6000 is up to **28%** faster in 3DMark. In Userbenchmark, the HD 6000 is up to **69%** faster.

apple,"I printed all the logos from the last keynote, and it's glorious (plus link to download the full resolution image)","When I first saw the Apple logos from the invite, I immediately knew they will be awesome when printed. I wanted them on my wall. At the time there was only a handful of logos known, pretty simple to print. But when I woke up the next day, there was a staggering 372 logos found!

I waited for them to be available in full resolution ([thanks Reddit for finding the link I used](https://m.imgur.com/a/ufybGk6)), and then undertook to combine them in one giant picture. I had a 100cm by 50cm print in mind.

There isn't that much possibilities to align all 372 in one rectangle: 12 x 31 is a good one, very close to the 1:2 ratio wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

I used the command line tool `magick` to combine them.

For all 12 lines, I combined 31 logos:

`magick convert +append ./line1/*.jpg line1.png`

Then I added margins to the top and bottom of the lines, to get the perfect 1:2 ratio on the final image:

`magick convert line1.png -bordercolor ""rgb(248,248,248)"" -border 0x391 ./borders/line1.png`

And finally I combined all the lines together:

`magick convert -append *.png final.png`

I ended up with a gigantic image file, 44k by 22k pixels!

&amp;#x200B;

I then opened it up in Photoshop and reduced the size to have a much more reasonable 100cm by 50cm at 400dpi (normally for print it's 300dpi, but a little more can't hurt). I also changed the white point, strangely on the original images it was 248 248 248 rgb, and not 255 255 255. I needed pure white for the print background (the paper is white). And voilà!

[Here is the link to download the image I printed](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1751Pqp4NVMdiuRkGDd7gmIaMED_Ad0O_).

There is a good art printer in my town ([Impression Panoramique in Strasbourg](https://www.impression-panoramique.com)), and it cost me 70€ for the print. I used the Hahnemühle Photo Rag satin 310g paper, because it's mat where there is no ink and satin-finished on the ink. Each logo is approximately the size of the logo on the back of an iPhone. But the resolution is insane, you can watch as close as you want, all the details are there.

apple,Steve Jobs once said that Apple almost went bankrupt because it focused too much on making a profit,"In light of all the recent price hikes to Apple's products I was reminded by a quote I read once from Steve Jobs. He was talking about why Apple started failing and almost went bankrupt before they brought Steve back into the company. He said:

[Source at 29:45](https://youtu.be/e-B9LikzxyM?t=1784)
&gt; What happened at Apple, to be honest, over the years was the goal used to be to make the best computers in the world. And that was goal one. Goal two, we got from Hewlett-Packard actually which was ""we have to make a profit"". Because if we don't make a profit we can't do goal one. So, yeah, I mean we enjoyed making a profit, but the purpose of making a profit was so we can make the best computers in the world. Along the way somewhere those two got reversed. The goal is to make a lot of money and well, if we have to make some good computers well ok we'll do that... 'cause we can make a lot of money doing that. And, it's very subtle. It's very subtle at first, but it turns out it's everything. That one little subtle flip... takes 5 years to see it, but that one little subtle flip in 5 years means everything.

This phrase is also amusing ([at 28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-B9LikzxyM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1697)):
&gt; Lastly, we're really big on making computers our friends can afford, and not all our friends are Larry Ellison.

apple,Full screen Siri needs to go.,"I would be much more inclined to use Siri if it didn’t completely take over whatever I’m using my device for. Something as simple as “Hey Siri, how cold is it outside?” while scrolling Twitter would be much more useful if Siri appeared as a notification banner (like on Mac), or even an option for her to just reply via voice only.  

Just look how ridiculous Siri looks on the [new iPad Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DTy32jdjP0&amp;t=11m20s).

SERIOUSLY? All that beautiful real estate wasted for black empty space. It baffles me that the team at Apple looked at that and went “yeah, that’s fine.” 

Full screen Siri made more sense when personal assistants on our phones were emerging and unfamiliar, but it makes absolutely no sense in 2018. If Apple really wants to increase Siri utilization, Siri needs to evolve into a more passive experience, and taking over the entire screen of your device is the opposite of that.

It's as insane as you'd expect from them - completely over-the-top while being pure minimalism. This diamond ring is not a ring with diamonds on it; it is quite literally [a diamond ring](http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/red-n10000/lot.pr.9YPHM.html).

&gt;	*Sir Jony Ive, Apple’s Chief Design Officer, and renowned industrial designer Marc Newson - having curated the (RED) auction five years ago - have, this year, designed a unique ring, made exclusively for (RED) by Diamond Foundry®. Consistent with their mutual obsession with transforming raw material into objects of value, Ive &amp; Newson’s design is singular, clear and un-compromised by the traditional metal settings and bands that have previously been required to create ‘diamond rings’. Theirs will be created by removing material rather than adding - an ambition made possible by the extraordinary scale of the stone which will enable the ring to be completely made of this material.*  

&gt;	*Creating a ring-shaped diamond is no small feat; the diamond block will be faceted with several thousand facets, some of which are as small as several hundred micrometers. The interior ring will be cylindrically cut out for the desired smoothness using a micrometer thick water jet inside which a laser beam is cast. The finished ring will have between 2000-3000 facets which has never been seen before on a single piece.*

&gt;	*The gemstone will be created by Diamond Foundry®, the certified carbon neutral diamond producer who has pioneered and developed the proprietary technology to form diamonds safely and sustainably.*

apple,It ain't easy being an apple fanboy in some countries,"TL;DR Apple retail presence in other countries is not great.

This post was inspired by today's post about a guy who went to an Apple store and [got a new iPhone replacement](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9vyb4e/today_was_the_reason_why_im_proud_and_always_will/) on the spot.

I live in Ukraine and I'm currently looking into replacing my old Macbook Air with Macbook Pro. I want to buy a 13' model with 16gb of RAM.

First - the price. The same 13' model will cost approximately 25% more compared to US prices, so $2000 easily translates into $2500.
I'd imagine that Apple products are not cheap anywhere, but c'mon. $500 markup is in fact more than the average monthly wage ($400) in the capital.
This makes Apple laptops a needlessly elitist thing. When people see that you have a Macbook, half the them thinks you're cool, another half thinks you're stupid.

To put it in perspective, I can book a flight to Dubai, buy Macbook there, come back and it's going to cost me the same amount of money.

But wait there's more. We don't have any offical Apple stores here and resellers only sell standard models. So to buy a 16gb model, I'd need to go to one of the stores that imports Apple stuff unofficially. They way this works is that they buy Apple products in USA and then import (smuggle?) them here.
Because companies like that offer cheaper prices and wider selection, they are in fact more popular than authorized resellers.

There are side effects though. You will end up with US style charger and would have to use an adapter. Ukrainian keyboard? The store will make their own laser etchings. But most importantly, if something is to happen to your device, if there's a recall, you're fucked. Best these stores can do is try to fix it. I had a Mac Mini with faulty motherboard and I had to wait a month, while it was shipped to Poland, fixed there and shipped back.

This is a sharp contrast to a certain Korean company that does have an official presence in Ukraine and doesn't have any of these problems.

Watching keynotes is a mixed experience. Apple Watch Series 3 big feature was cellular support. Doesn't work here. ECG in Series 4? Nope. Why buy Homepod when Siri cannot understand English artists names in Russian voice commands?

All in all, having beautiful glass stores is great and all, but I'd prefer shittier stores with an actual opportunity to buy a product.",525,1759,2018-11-11,AAPL,0.04212408885359764,0.920486330986023,0.03738963603973389

apple,PSA: Tomorrow is the last day to buy AppleCare+ for Day One iPhone XS/Max and Apple Watch Series 4,"#MISLEADING: Tomorrow is not the last day to buy AppleCare+. You have 10 days to do so. Read the stickied comment for more info. 

I foolishly used the release date day count on Macrumors and since it says 59 for both the Apple Watch and the iPhone, I thought that the last day to buy AppleCare+ was tomorrow, the 60th day of release.

____

If you pre-ordered the new gadgets from Apple and received them on Day One (September 21st), you have until tomorrow to buy AppleCare+

Apple gives customers 60 days to buy AppleCare+. After this, you might** not be able to buy it.

** You might get be able to buy AppleCare+ after the 60 days depending on the representative you get when you call in, and how far away you are from the 60 day mark

**AC+ for iPhone**

AC+ for iPhone extends the iPhone's limited warranty of one year, to two and gives users 2 incidents of accidental damage (cracked screen, water damage (which isn't covered by the limited warranty despite the phones being water resistant), and etc). 

Aside from the regular AC+, now Apple offers AC+ with Theft and Loss (AC+TL) protection. This one offers the same benefits as the regular one, but in addition, it allows users to pay a deductible to have Apple replace their lost/stolen iPhone. 

Here are the deductibles for AC+:



**Incident**| **AC+ Fee** | **AC+TL Fee**
---|---|----
Screen damage | $29 | $29
Any other damage | $99 | $99
Theft/Loss | N/A | $199 - iPhone 6S, 7, 8
| | N/A | $229 - iPhone 6S+, 7+, 8+, XR
| | N/A | $269 - iPhone X, XS, XS Max

If you use the two incidents, you will be paying the Out-Of-Warranty fee to repair your device



**Device** | **Fee**
---|---
iPhone XS Max | $599
iPhone XS, iPhone X | $549
iPhone XR, iPhone 8+ | $399
iPhone 8, iPhone 7+ | $349
iPhone 7 | $319
iPhone 6S+, 6+ | $329
iPhone 6S, iPhone 6 | $299
iPhone SE, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPhone 5 | $269



In addition, as a AC+ holder, you are entitled to use the ""iPhone Express Replacement Service"" as part of the AC+ benefits. With the Express Replacement Service, Apple sends you a replacement iPhone with a prepaid package to send your defective iPhone back. Apple will place an authorization on your card on the full amount of the device ($1,449 for a 512GB iPhone XS Max, for example) and will expire when they get the defective product on time and the repair is covered under warranty, AppleCare or consumer law. 

If you return the device late, Apple will charge you a fee. These fees are listed [on this page](https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/express-replacement). 

**Prices**


Device | AC+ Price Full- Monthly | AC+TL Full - Monthly
---|---|----
iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max | $199 - $9.99/24mo | $299 - $14.99/24mo

iPhone 8, iPhone 7 | $129 - $5.99/24mo | $199 - $9.99/24mo



Notes:

* Theft and loss coverage requires you to have Find My iPhone enabled on your device at the time it is lost or stolen

* Monthly payments can be stopped at any time, but once stopped, they can't be re-activated

apple,Apple Pencil 2 is $30 more and doesnt even come witg replacement tips.,"My Apple Pencil 2 slipped from my hand and hit the floor tip first. I didn't think it was a problem till I tried writing some notes and I noticed it just straight wasn't writing. I looked at the tip and noticed it dented. I had figured that my $130 stylist could handle a 3ft fall but I guess not. It wasn't to much a problem I thought, there should be some extra tips in the box like the old one did. To my surprise all the box had was the pencil and some papers showing me how to charge it. Very classy apple. Charge me $30 more and don't even include pieces to make the product last longer

The magnets inside the iPad were pulling on it causing the blades to hit the fan housing. I moved the iPad away and it stopped making the noise immediately.

I don’t think I have a bad fan as I purchased this MacBook 2 days ago.

So you may want to think twice about putting these two guys very close together in a bag or when walking around or you may end up with a bad fan (especially if you just closed the lid as the fan will continue running until the MacBook has cooled off sufficiently.)

EDIT: This probably isn’t an issue for The 12” MacBook as it is fanless.

apple,Props to Adam in Apple store.,"I was at this Apple store in Fashion Square - Scottsdale with my friend checking out the new iPad Pro and the other products. 

While we were checking out the new iPad and the new pen, we faced a little problem making the pen work because it was not connected to the iPad, on the other side of the table was Adam, who is a customer service guy, he noticed that we had a problem so he came over and helped us out, he showed us how the pen works, how can I use it and how nice it is. He also showed us around the new iPad in great detail, he showed us the new typing cover and examined all angles of it. 


That all sounds normal until you realize that he did all of that while being blind. I was so amazed and stunned by his work and by how accurate he was, he was pointing at everything and describing it like everything was normal and there is no problem at all. I have never seen this kind of customer service ever in my life and not in any retail store. I was really amazed, so I wanted to give him this shoutout.


edit 1: I am going to send a letter/email to both Apple and the store

apple,Is it just me or has Google nerfed the YouTube app into the ground?,"Has anyone else had this issue? YouTube just being overall much worse/laggier than it was a few months ago? Scrolling through comments sections is a stuttery mess for me, as well as screen rotation along with some other bugs. I have an iPad with an older version of YouTube on it and it’s buttery smooth. But my X is just laggy on YouTube.

Edit: Everyone please go on the YouTube app and hit the submit feedback button and let YouTube know

Edit2: From reading the comments, it seems that a large chunk of us are having issues, while others aren’t. So I recorded a quick clip to demonstrate the issues I’m experiencing. Certain parts of the app are super smooth, while others are.... well... see for yourself.

apple,In 2012 Apple spent $356M to buy AuthenTec Inc. (fingerprint sensor company). They introduced TouchID in September 2013 and have effectively removed it from their newest iOS devices in September 2017 (iPhone) and Oct 2018 (iPad),"Apple spent $356M to buy Authentic Inc on July 12, 2012 ([wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AuthenTec)) and then spent $XXM on further R&amp;D and have effectively killed that technology on their 2 most popular product lines within 5 years. 

Imagine spending ~$400M+ on primarily a 5 year technology rental for a button. (I understand it's in the Mac and the work on the Secure Enclave lives on etc. and it's not really dead) The scale of modern technology and Apple is still just staggering. By all accounts the acquisition was a success. 

Using a XS and playing with my cousins new iPad Pro I'm fully bought into FaceID, but touchID was/is awesome! Some of the designs around it are some of Apples best: The stainless steel ring, which looks classy, but is instrumental to the functionality of the system for example. The stainless steel ring is what actually detects your finger and activates the fingerprint reader, not the pushing down of the button. They use the same system on the iPhone 7 and 8, with the simulated buttons. If you push down on the glass in the center of the button without touching the stainless steel ring, you won't activate the 'button'/won't get any haptic feedback.",148,403,2018-11-20,AAPL,0.019487949088215828,0.9141931533813477,0.06631895154714584

AppleWatch,How an Apple Watch potentially saved my life.,"So I used to have an apple watch and I loved that thing. I don't have it now because it broke but one night while I did have it, it potentially gave me the heads up to call an ambulance. So I wanted to share my story.   


I am a trucker so I wasn't exactly living the healthiest lifestyle on the planet (mainly I drank a 2 liter of Mountain Dew a day while smoking 2 packs a day). One night back in late 2016 while I was laying in my bed in West Memphis Arkansas, my watch went off to tell me my heart rate had risen, I felt fine all in all but the alert made me question what could be going on. I sat up out of bed and felt my neck. It was right, my heart was beating faster. I looked at my watch and it was tracking me at 140bpm which was unusual considering I was laying down falling asleep. I got dressed and decided to go inside the building and get some water, thinking if I walked a little and then laid back down, my heart rate would drop and I'd be good.   


I go inside, pee, and drink a bit of water and I started to feel it in my body, my heart rate was still going fast, I check my watch again, and it's reading 165bpm. I started to worry.   


My initial thought process was that maybe the watch was malfunctioning and cause me to falsely panic which was making my heart rate rise, but it had never risen THAT high before. I decided to call 911 because I was feeling nauseous about it all and wanted to play it safe. They sent out an ambulance and I explained to them what the watch was showing me and showed it to them and they initially giggled it off, telling me that it is probably faulty and I only think my heart rate is fast because the watch is telling me. All a mind game, right?   


The moment they put their monitor on my finger, BAM! 170bpm, I got worried again because the looks on their faces changed and they started talking to me different.  They decided to take me to the hospital in Memphis TN and as soon as we loaded up that driver was RACING to the hospital. I could hear some of what they were saying away from me into the radios and to each other, risk of heart failure, crash carts and what not and I started to freak. I thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die. The EMT started to tell me to push like I had to poop and this exercise would help lower my heart rate, which it did for about 3 seconds and then it shot right back up.   


We get to the hospital and there is a team of nurses and doctors waiting for me and they started hooking me up to an IV and all sorts of stickers on my torso and back, and took some blood samples. I didn't really know what it was all for but I ended up in a room hooked to a drip and a machine and then as quickly as everyone was working, they all cleared the room. I was alone. I still had my watch on and my phone with me so I started watching youtube videos. After an hour or so a nurse started checking on me regularly and we both noticed my heart rate was falling slowly, super slowly. It took 6 hours for my heart rate to fall back below 100bpm. A doctor told me before they released me that I had a severe cardiac arrhythmia and that sometimes these things happen without warning and could potentially be fatal in some cases. I think it was caused by my unhealthy habits and since that night I have not had one sip of mountain dew. I can't even stand the smell of that stuff anymore. I don't smoke anymore either. I contribute it all to that apple watch. If I hadn't had it that night, I could have gone to sleep not knowing what my body was really doing and not woken up. I haven't had an episode like that since that night but I think it's mostly cause I changed my lifestyle. If I had an IPhone still, I'd have an apple watch. And I tell people who have IPhones to get a watch solely because of what mine did for me.",223,2308,2018-11-23,AAPL,0.06895170360803604,0.9043227434158325,0.026725592091679573

I used to be able to tell friends that even a low-end Mac would be a good experience. That they could get a base model and it would still be decent. That Apple doesn't sell a ""bad"" computer; rather, they have ""good, better, best"" tiers. That is not the case anymore.

apple,"Just moved from an iPhone X to a 5s, and wow. All the planned obsolescence bleaters can suck it.","Sold my iPhone X to a friend for a good deal, but I don't have money for an XS Max until next month so I got a second-hand (at least) **5s** to make do with in the meantime.

My usual usage:

- Phone calls, LTE
- SMS, iMessage, WhatsApp, Discord
- Apple Watch Series 4 (non-cellular), workouts
- AirPods, Apple Music, Soundcloud
- iBooks, Google Maps, Translate, Uber and a few other assorted apps
- Safari

Updated the 5s to iOS 12.1. It's only 16 GB, but I got access to all my data and iCloud Drive files except for photos and some very large apps, within an hour of choosing to restore from the iPhone X backup and automatically syncing everything over the net. Even the place where I left my last iBook was there!

I don't even feel that much of a slowdown. It's only most apparent in the Camera app, and sometimes hiccups in AirPods music playback when there's a bunch of other things going on at the same time. And of course it doesn't take photos as good as the X. 

It also got very hot several times at first but it seems fine now a couple days later.

Battery time on a full charge is as might be expected on such an old device. I haven't extensively measured it but it is *at least* 4 hours of normal usage (intermittent calls/messaging/browsing), though it dropped from almost 100% to 10% within 1 hour of doing an ""Outdoor Walk"" workout with the Apple Watch and listening to Apple Music on the AirPods while using Maps, on LTE. Seems fair? I'm not bothered as I always carry a portable charger anyway and can leave it plugged in.

I think I'll be keeping this as a backup phone even after getting a Max.
