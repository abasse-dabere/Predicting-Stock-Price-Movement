apple,"My Experience: IPad Pro 12.9"" vs 9.7"" vs Surface Pro 4","For those on the fence, looking for a comparison:

I purchased all three devices, with all major keyboard accessories.  I am an attorney, and value having the ability to take notes, annotate PDFs, use MS Office, Dropbox, Gmail, etc.  I want a device that can do it all without compromise. 

For those who wonder about my ecosystem preference, I have none.  My primary desktop runs Windows 7.  My primary laptop is a Macbook Pro.  I had a Galaxy S6, moved to an IPhone 6s, currently use an S7E.  I like them all.

The short answer is that all three devices are flawed, and I am keeping the IPP 9.7"".  The long answers are below.

**IPad Pro 12.9"":**

* Good.  Build quality.  The screen is gorgeous.  Viewing PDFs on the device is a thrilling experience.  You can have a full page open and scaled to 100%.  Annotating is a pleasure due to the screen size.  Landscape mode works very well, in that applications have plenty of room within -- Gmail is a great example.  The smart keyboard is a pleasure to type on (this surprised me, I have high standards for keyboards). Alt tabbing applications works very well.   The pen to screen input is phenomenal.  I can write so very small, it picks everything up.  It often feels better than paper.  This device had the best writing experience of the three. The pencil itself feels like a large Cross pen to me.  I enjoy the length and weight.  It encourages me to hold it lightly -- no grip of death.  There is slightly less latency on the 12.9"" than 9.7"", and the screen writing experience is not identical between the iPads.  The screen is superb.  Video viewing is pleasurable.  Sound is decent, better than the 9.7"", although I found a slight lack of stereo.  Notability is awesome.

* Bad.  It is almost comically large for a tablet.  It is also as heavy as the SP4.  Holding it with one hand is an exercise in exhaustion for any period of length.  You will need a table for this device, although I was able to place it on my lap when sitting cross legged, for note taking. Standing open with the keyboard, it is no smaller on the form factor front than my 13"" MBPr.  That doesn't work well for airline travel, or compactness.  The smart keyboard cover is a folding mess on the 12.9"".  It flops everywhere, and folding it under for note taking creates a wobbly experience.  Very annoying.  Even at 12.9”, the split screen function isn't great, but it works.  I found tabbing between applications to be a better solution.  Where do I keep the pen?  Battery life is OK -- I couldn't forget my charger on a short (2-3 day) trip.  IOS is not a Windows 10 replacement.  I was able to accomplish some basic tasks.  There is no way to really power edit PDFs and create work product in a way that compares to Windows or Mac OS.  Everything takes longer.  It is not a laptop replacement if you need anything more than basic word and notetaking use.  You really need wifi access to make this thing work well. Annotating in MS Word is laggy.

**IPad Pro 9.7"":**

* Good.  This size and weight feels very comfortable.  The Smart Keyboard flapping issue is much less pronounced.  It fits perfectly in your lap and on a desk.  One handed holding is no problem.  Form factor is great for airline travel.  The screen looks fantastic, and I enjoy the color shifts.  This device feels the right size, even when tucked inside the silicone case.  Sound is great, although there was more bass in the 12.9"".  Build quality.

* Bad.  The writing experience is not as good as the 12.9"".  I detect slightly more latency.  Pen input doesn't register quite as well.  The actual feel of writing on the screen is slightly different.  Really strange.  The keyboard is very cramped, and still usable once you practice a bit.  My keyboard lifts off the table a little bit -- I've read similar complaints.  Landscape mode is a bit cramped with certain applications, Gmail can use a bit of additional space. Don't even bother split screening.  


**Surface Pro 4:**

* Good:  Windows 10 Pro!  Keyboard is very decent, although the typing experience isn't much better than the IPP 12.9"".  Kickstand is great, especially folding all the way back to create a writing stand.  This also works well when sitting cross legged, and having the kickstand wrapped around your leg.  USB, DisplayPort.  It's a real computer.  The pen feels more industrial -- it has a series of buttons that really work well.  Loading Onenote by clicking the eraser is a nice function.  The magnetic strip works much better now than with the SP1 -- the pen stays put.  The size of the device will work better, particularly on an airplane, simply due to the kickstand adjustability.  

* Bad:  I wanted the like the SP4 more than both IPP's.  If didn't value the writing experience, I probably would.  The writing experience on the SP4, compared to the IPP, is terrible.  I tried adjusting pen sensitivity.  I bought the different nibs.  I used multiple programs.  I tested it against the SP4 display model.  Writing is flawed.  It does not register pen inputs with anywhere near the preciseness of the IPP.  Writing on the IPad glass is a far more satisfying experience.  I can write in the very smallest print on the IPP -- not so with the SP4.  My signature looks like my signature on the IPP -- it looks merely acceptable on the SP4. The screen on the SP4 is softer, the pen drags more.  If you care about art, detailed note taking, anything regarding the pen experience, you need the IPP.  I prefer the feel of the Apple Pencil to the SP4.  The SP4 keyboard did smell like paint thinner something fierce.  The SP4 would be impossible to use with one hand.  It's heavy.  Battery life isn't fantastic.  

**IPP vs. SP4:**  

If you need a full laptop replacement, the IPP isn't your companion.  If you need the best note taking technology, the IPP is.  If you need the best note taking technology, and a laptop replacement, I think you're out of luck.  That's why I believe the choice is ultimately a compromise.  I ultimately chose the 9.7"" due to the size and weight.  If you don't mind the larger form factor, the 12.9"" is your ideal device.  The SP4 is only an option if you want something that will capture note taking at 75% of the IPP, and need Windows 10.  75% simply isn't good enough for me.",353,971,2016-04-03,AAPL,0.030506997369229794,0.9203924536705017,0.04910053126513958

apple,Monthly APPreciation Thread for April 2016,"Here's this month's App recommendation thread! What apps have you been enjoying for the past month?
*****
**Guidelines**  

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.  
* **One app per comment.**
* Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS, OS X, WatchOS and TV OS are all game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a few sentences, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc) because everyone knows about those.

apple,"So I used the 12.9"" iPad Pro as a computer for two months.","EDIT: I forgot two ""cons"": 

* When the iPad is connected to the Smart Keyboard, it tilts at ~30 deg. Unlike the Surface Pro 4, this isn't adjustable. I found this to be too wide sometimes and had to resort to hacks to reduce the angle. This was a little off-putting given how expensive this thing is and how the SP4 solved this problem already. 

* Apple really nailed it with the pen, but they completely missed on solutions for storing the damn thing. Charging it is awkward (stick it into the Lightning slot), but that's not terrible given that it charges very, very quickly. Storing it is impossible. I had to resort to using the end of a pen with a removable top and clipping it to the top of my Smart Keyboard. Again, given the cost of this thing, that was quite upsetting.

---

I figured that after seeing a few posts on here reflecting on their experiences with the iPad Pro, I should chime in with mine.

A bit of background: I am a systems engineer. Most of my time on a computer is spent either in a Terminal, usually in vim, or in Chrome. I occasionally use things like Excel or Photoshop for some ad-hoc things too. I've long been wanting an iPad Pro to write stuff with, but after realizing that I spent more time on that than on my MacBook Air, I thought: *what if I used my Pro full-time?*

After discovering the awesomeness that is Prompt, I sold my Air and sought to find out!

At first, I was really, really excited by the idea. I showed it off quite a bit and talked it up [on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/49p73g/ipad_pro_one_month_later/) and elsewhere. However, after doing some ""real, real work"" on it for several weeks (namely, lots of AWS and AD automation), its sore spots became increasingly apparent and, unfortunately, increasingly annoying. 

Here's what I found:

# PROS

* It's really light, even with the keyboard and pencil. It was a joy to carry around.
* AMAZING screen. Colors look great, viewing angles are perfect and everything on it was sharp as a tack.
* The Smart Keyboard is surprisingly tactile. It reminded me a lot of the mechanical keyboards that I've used in the past. It was loud (which I like; my girlfriend didn't) and felt great to type on.
* The pencil is amazingly accurate. Notability ROCKS. It's much better than the mobile versions of OneNote (but not the desktop version, which kind-of sucked to use when I had a Surface). It feels like a really high-quality pen; it's worth every bit of its $99 asking price. It was much more pleasant to use than the Surface Pen.
* **For iOS workloads**, the iPad Pro is FAST. It blazes through damn well nearly anything, as you would expect. (Non-iOS workloads were a different story, see the *Cons* below.)

* For a tablet as big as it is (it's bigger than a MacBook Pro), it's actually really pleasant to hold. I really enjoyed reading books on it (and enjoyed annotating them even more!)

* Battery life was REALLY good (though not as good as my MacBook Air).

# CONS

* iOS doesn't support mice. While I got used to touching my screen for everything (it became quite natural after a short while), it would have been nice to use a mouse for certain things.

* Prompt is much slower than a native Terminal.

* CMD + TAB is REALLY janky on the Smart Keyboard. Some icons will bring you to the wrong applications. Other apps will attempt to activate the on-screen keyboard when you switch into them (including Prompt) which has led to some unexpected behavior. This was a HUGE pain.

* Some apps do not work with the Smart Keyboard that well yet (including Remote Desktop).

* A lot of webpages don't really work right on Mobile Safari. Anything that requires you to click and hold does not work yet. Also, keyboard shortcuts that typically work on online IDEs don't work at all on the iPad. This became incredibly frustrating without a mouse.

# VERDICT

I really wanted to like this setup, but I ultimately found it too limiting for my needs. Replacing it was a bit difficult though:

* The MacBook Pro is a great machine, but is heavy compared the iPad Pro (or even a MacBook Air) and most of its power will go unused.

* The MacBook Air is perfect...except for its non-Retina screen. Once you go Retina, there's no coming back.

* The MacBook is perfect and the lightest option, [but it is slightly underpowered](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/46cvga/i_got_a_macbook_a_few_days_ago_i_think_im_going/) and its battery life is not the greatest.

* The Surface Pro 4 is an all-around great computer that gives me the flexibility of the Pro and the power of a MacBook Pro, but I'd have to go back to using Windows. I love working with Windows on the server, but not so much on the desktop. (I was a long-time Windows user.)

I landed up getting the MacBook (again). While it isn't as powerful or as long-lasting as I'd like it to be, it's the closest thing to what I'm looking for and a MacBook refresh seems to be a while out.

I hope this helps someone!",166,471,2016-04-04,AAPL,0.04810109920799732,0.7762020528316498,0.17569686565548182

apple,How is it Siri is so far behind Google?,"I rarely use Siri, and when I do I've learned to keep it to extremely simple tasks like setting a timer or a reminder. This is because anything more complicated usually gives me a web search.. in which case why not just ask the Google app and get the right answer?

Today is my brother's birthday and I wanted to remember to call him. So I pick up my phone and say ""remind me later today to call Chris,"" expecting Siri would set a reminder for some time this afternoon saying ""call Chris."" Siri dutifully printed out what I had asked of her, then asked me ""which Chris?"", listing all of the Chris's in my contacts. I picked the right one, after which she asked ""which number?"" and listed his numbers without any context, so I made a guess and chose one. Siri then says ""OK, calling Chris,"" and dials him.

Apple is worth billions of dollars, and this is a use case well within what they advertise for a highly advertised feature of their flagship product. Siri simply seems to be only marginally helpful, whereas Google seems to get it right almost all of the time. If they aren't going to put the effort into making Siri competitive they should let us change the default over to another service (of course that's a joke because they'd never let us control our own devices to that extent).

apple,Switched to an Iphone SE. Realised what I lost before the 6 came out.,"You know when times change and you get used to it, then you get that sudden flash of nostalgia and realise what you don't have anymore. Like how smells trigger memories.

I jumped on the Iphone 6 bandwagon when it came out. Apple and Android were both switching to larger phones and I convinced myself ""If they think large is what the times are heading towards, then there must be a reason to switch"". So I did. Went from a 5s, which I adored, to a 6.

I kept my 6 until today. Today I switched to an SE and realised what I was missing:

- Not having to shuffle the large phone in my pocket to stand still and minimise bulge.
- Being able to hold a cup of coffee in one hand and switch songs without looking for a place to set my coffee down.
- Being able to pick up the phone with my thumbs instead of sliding it off a table cause the sides are so thin.
- NEVER having to worry about hitting the power button when turning the volume down
- My pinky doesn't hurt
- My palm doesn't hurt as I don't have to squeeze for dear life in fear of the phone slipping
- The volume buttons are round and tactile instead of thin and slippery
- Battery...

I forgot that using my phone was a choice and not a burden. Weird.",664,1449,2016-04-09,AAPL,0.03908205404877663,0.9213595986366272,0.039558347314596176

[How-to]:


Just go to Settings -&gt; Update and Security -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Get Insider Builds, and turn on ""Fast Ring"" on any Windows 10 PC. After a reboot and an update, turn on ""Developer mode"" in ""For Developers"" on the ""Update &amp; Security"" page. Then go to Control Panel -&gt; Program and Features -&gt; Turn Windows Features on or off -&gt; Windows SubSystem for Linux (Beta), and click OK. 


After a reboot, open Command Line and type in ""bash"". Then Windows will prompt to download Ubuntu image from the Windows Store, and once that's done, just install Swift as how you install it in Ubuntu. 


When unarchiving the tar.gz file, symbolic links will fail to create. Note down the few failures in bash, then go to Explorer, go to C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\lxss\root, manually duplicate the relevant files + renaming them in Explorer. [Alternatively, you can cp them in bash as well]. 


After the setup, just go with ./swift [sourcefile].swift to compile and run it. Swift interactive shell does not yet work, but compilation of source file does work :)

apple,What's the next big thing for Apple?,"I was listening to my dad the other day talk about how Apple feels a lot like it's spiraling down back into the ""[days of John Sculley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley#1983.E2.80.9393:_Apple_Inc.)"" Obviously that is an unfair comparison (in my limited knowledge, Sculley oversaw the release of some important improvements like the Mac OS 7 and the Newton, the latter which would be foundational to inspiring some components of the iPhone). But the sentiment is that they're iterating too much on their hardware and focusing too much on building an enthusiasm that doesn't exist.

Now, as an Apple fanboy growing up, I'm probably biased and have high expectations. Having owned the original iBook, and iPod, and the iPod video (remember that?), and the original iPhone, I feel like the most recent development of the Apple Watch holds potential but hasn't had me excited. Let's be fair though– the original iPhone, while stirring excitement, didn't get wide adoption until about the 3GS, so I'm not saying Apple Watch will eventually get prevalent: in fact, I expect it to be ubiquitous within the next 2 or 3 iterations.

But I've heard a saying before– ""a gut feeling is somewhere between the head and the heart""– and my gut feeling is telling me that Apple currently is lost a bit at the ocean. I also know of the Apple car rumors and the VR rumors, but to me I feel like Apple is chasing the bandwagon rather than really thinking about reimagining how we personally interact with technology.

I own the Apple Watch and to me, in spite of the personal touch (e.g. customizable bands and faces, and the heartbeat technology which I use with my long distance girlfriend), it doesn't inspire a sense of wonder. Maybe that's what troubles me.

As much as I appreciate the tight ship Tim Cook is running, I feel like he's the Spock– there needs to be more of Captain Kirk in the Tim, and iterations will only get Apple so far. :( Happy to hear disagreements.

Also kind of related to the oft-requested feature whereby different members of a family could Touch ID themselves into, for example, the family iPad and view their own personalized setup. 

Utilizing that concept: in addition to a ""stealth"" or other set of actions I mentioned in the title, it could unlock the phone in basically a guest mode, or something else that seems normal enough, but is still locked down to a variety of intruders.

apple,iPhone SE Review: All the little things.,"In this unprofessional review I’ll be directly comparing the iPhone SE to the iPhone 6S. 

I may repeat myself or even contradict myself at times, but hey here it is.


**Screen:**

I'm very picky about screen quality.

When turned up to half brightness or higher, a weird screen effect is noticeable. It looks like there are some vertical lines that are brighter (or the others are dimmer). This is easier to see on the Mail app icon or wherever there is blue. This effect has been seen on IPS monitors when overclocked. It's something most people won't notice.

There is some slight yellowing on the top edge of the screen, so that’s going to be a thing again. 

Blacks are not as black compared to the 6S. (Apple please get OLED.) 

Colors are slightly more vibrant and the screen is bonded closer on the 6S compared to the SE.

Backlighting is more uneven than the 6S.

The SE is slightly more dim than the 6S.

The rounded glass on the 6S makes edge swiping nicer than on the SE.


**Rear Camera:**

Being flush with the phone really gives me a hard-on. That’s all.


**Front-Facing Camera:**

I like the position of the front-facing camera being above and center of the earpiece. It just looks nice. Unfortunately the picture quality is not as good as the 6S, but this is expected. For my personal use I didn’t care too much about it, it works fine for my needs. I barely take selfies or video chat. 


**Body Design:**

I love the 5S design, especially now that the edges are completely matte. However it’s still a bit “sharp” feeling, but at least it’s easier to grip than the 6S. The form factor is great for one-handed use, everyone will tell you that. 

I also love that it sits flat on my desk instead of having the camera-bump wobble like the 6S.

The “pocketability” of this phone is a bit nicer than the 6S.


**Touch-ID:**

I did a side-by-side comparison with my 6S and shockingly it is JUST AS FAST to unlock. I tried with both thumbs on each phone, reset TouchID on both of them, and tried again. Same results. Both phones unlock at the same time. Perhaps TouchID speed is based on the A9. However, the 6S has far fewer failures at reading the print. If the 6S is 95%, the SE is 85%. 


**Buttons:**

Buttons need more pressure to get a full click and the click has a deeper sound to it. The lock button at the top of the SE has an extremely small amount of wiggle to it. I kind of miss the lock button on the side, but there are no accidental locks while pressing the volume buttons at least! It’s easy enough to reach anyway. Overall the SE button quality is worse than the 6S.


**Speaker:**

There’s a difference between the two, but I’m not a pro at audio. I think the SE is louder, but lower quality. 6S has an overall better speaker. 


**Vibration:**

Once you have a 6S and get used to its vibration, going back to the SE feels like absolute shit. It just sounds irritating and it doesn’t even vibrate the phone as hard as the 6S does. I opted to turn off the vibration completely unless I’m in silent mode for the SE.


**Speed:**

Equally as fast as the 6S, which is blazing fast. Everything loads instantly. I love having a phone this small with this speed while still maintaining a decent battery life.


**UI:**

iOS still feels like it was made for 4” phones. Which is why all of the navigation buttons are spread near the top and bottom unlike Android that has the three main buttons near the bottom and the often used swipe gesture for menus. Getting around iOS on the SE was almost kind of fun! 

Typing with both hands felt kind of cramped, but was a breeze with one hand.


**Battery Life:**

Battery is a bit better. I end the day with 15% more battery than the 6S, so maybe an extra hour of use. Take this with a grain of salt, I haven't had the phone long enough to have a proper battery life review. 


**Waterproofness:**

Well I didn't drop it in water. A+ Gold star.

Although doing some quick Googling shows the SE is fairly water resistant. Don't drop your phone in water.


**Media:**

I’ve taken a different approach with how I use the SE. Stuff like YouTube and Tumblr and Reddit I’ll look at on my iPad or Macbook and the SE is kind of what you’d expect an Apple Watch to be used for: Messages, Notifications, quick glance stuff. However using YouTube and such is still very nice. 


**Durability:**

While the 6S feels more solid overall, I feel like it would be more likely to shatter than the SE. I could travel around with the SE without a case just fine, while with the 6S I wouldn't dare go caseless because Apple somehow created the phone to have zero friction when on any surface material. The 6S has slid out of my pocket while driving countless times, a problem I haven't had with the SE.


**In-Hand:**

Even though I don’t like the design of the 6S (mostly that Bikini line look), it’s far more ergonomic because of the rounded sides. It doesn’t dig into my hand and always feels comfortable to hold, even if I’m afraid of it sliding off into orbit. The SE has a grippier design and better for one-hand use, but it gets uncomfortable to hold because of the sharp edges. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Where the 6S is better:**

Screen Quality.

Vibration by FAR.

Button quality.

Front-facing Camera.

Overall higher quality feel.

3D Touch.




**Where the SE is better:**

Size for one-handed use.

Battery (by a little)

Better grip.

Pocketability.

Design (obviously opinion)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have the 6S, should you opt for the SE? No. Do not. Unless you absolutely cannot live with the 4.7” screen. 

If you have the 6, should you get the SE? Maybe. If you want a smaller screen, yes. 

If you have the 5S, should you get the SE?
Yes. Especially if you love the 5S. The SE is the 5S with the 6S speed and rear camera. Almost every review has said that. 

If you have the 4S or older, is the SE for you?
Fucking yes. Get out of the stone age. The fuck.


Final Thoughts: Even though the SE has a design I love, a great form factor for actual mobile use, and a pretty decent battery life... I'm not replacing my 6S with it. The screen quality and the vibration motor were the two biggest reasons. I don't use 3D Touch enough to consider it useful in my daily life, but the Taptic Motor is the most ""revolutionary"" thing Apple has done with the 6S. It's a shame they couldn't make a smaller version for the SE, but the SE is already very compact. Using the 5S display technology for the SE was a damn shame as well.

apple,"[Tutorials/Guides] In case you guys didn't know, you are able to side load Application tweaks and Apps that are generally not allowed on the App Store! Here are the tutorials!","Some people were inquiring about tutorials for the App tweaks and figured some other people might not have known this so I decided to make a separate post instead of sending a bunch of links to each users. So here's the ultimate thread!

*Requirements:*

- A Mac, Hackintosh, or OS X running in a VM if you don't have access to a Mac (Of Course)
- Latest version of Xcode
- An iOS Device you're side loading the tweak to
- USB Cable

So here we go!

*Snap Plus for SnapChat*

- [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9o9rFTycwE)
- [Github Link to everything you need for it](https://github.com/Defying/TweakPatcher)

1. First what'll you need to do is download the zip file from Github
2. Next, you'll need to download a cracked version of the latest Snapchat ipa (Google can help you, just search Snapchat ipa cracked on Vshare or Appcake)
3. Once you downloaded both the zip file and the cracked ipa, move the TweakPatcher folder to desktop and move the cracked ipa into the folder. Now, rename the ipa to Snapchat.ipa!
4. Once that's done, open up the terminal app
5. Drag the TweakPatcher.sh file on to the terminal app, then type *patch snapplus*, after that you'll have to drag the Snapchat.ipa to the terminal
6. The terminal will now do its thing, later it'll ask for a provisional file, open up Xcode, create a new project, and copy and paste the bundle id that is provided in the process.
7. Now from here on, you should be able to follow the directions that is on the terminal window, you shouldn't be able to get any errors, if you do, let me know!

Special thanks to the developer of Snapplus and the TweakPatcher developer!


*WhatsApp and Instagram*

- Now I am unsure on how to side load these tweaks myself, but I will report back and write a tutorial about it, if you're up for it you can figure it out
- [Github Link](https://github.com/iMokhles/Tweaks-for-SideLoaded-Apps)
- A redditor has figured it out on how to so you can follow him!
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4d9auy/release_non_jailbroken_devices_tweaks_for/d1p5xzy)

*Sideloading apps*

- [An awesome redditor who wrote a detailed description on how to side load RetroArch](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/comments/4e2m8w/guide_sideloading_retroarch_ios9/)
- [Here's a good tutorial on how to side load Kodi/Moviebox](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=245978)
- You'll need to download the deb of what you're installing

- First, download Xcode and iOS App signer that is provided in the link above (in the kodi forum)
- Download whatever ipa/deb of what you're installing
- Open up Xcode, create a new project, and single-view application
- There will be an error that says you need to fix your Provisional Profile, you have to have an Apple ID and sign in and fill out the info and press 'Fix Issue' (I believe that's what it says?)
- For the bundle id, it's com.(whatever your name is).(whatever the app name is)
- Next, open up App signer and click browse and then click the ipa or deb you want to sideload and pick your provisional profile to sign that app under your free developer profile.
- Once it's signed, open up Xcode and click windows &gt; devices and click your iDevice and click the + button and click on the signed spa
- At this point, everything should go right
- Hope that helped!
 
Others are also on the way, including tweaks for twitter, youtube, Facebook, twitch and Facebook messenger sometime this week or next week and will edit this post on how to do that. If there's anything I can change or improve on, let me know!

Absolutely no credit goes to me, but the developers and the redditors who made this possible!

If you're fully interested in side loading many things! There's a sub /r/Sideloaded and a wonderful website on Jailbreak apps that can and cannot be side loaded [here](http://h4ck.co.uk/sideload.html) including other apps you want to sideload [here](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps)

Soo, I fucked up. I do have small hands and I switched due to the 6 being too big but now I realised how accustomed I was to the larger screen cause everything is fucking tiny.

Like, wtf. I can't play games on this. How the fuck did I play games back in the 5-5s line?! Documents? I need my glasses. Twitter, Instagram, any sort of feed? Nope. Low res screen, tiny text and god awful screen real estate.

Also, bought it from a place that doesn't have a return policy and I already sold my 6. Soo yeah, I fucked up. I can't switch to the 6s cause the 7 is coming out in a in a few months and I kind of wish we had a 6s sized phone with a 1080p screen now :(. The 6S Plus is FAR, FAR too big. I hear OLED is a thing now...

Sorry if my post convinced anyone with their purchase. I hope you liked it more than I did.

iphone,16 Tips to save iDevice battery,"Since most guys complain about battery drain and battery life I decided to post this to help. 
16 Tips to save battery    

1. Go to Settings - Brightness - Auto Brightness OFF. Make sure your brightness slider is turned low when you are not using the device as brightness takes much battery. 

2 Go to Settings - Notifications and Turn Off notifications for most of Apps except the important ones. 

3 .Go to Settings - Privacy - Location and disable Location Services for most of the apps.or turn it off as they consume much battery and data and they are not really important.

4 Disable Apps Auto-Updating. This feature makes your apps gets automatically updates from App Store. If you have a lot of apps, then this is a must turn off feature. Go to Settings - iTunes and turn off auto downloads.

5 I set Auto-Lock for 1 minute. This will improve your battery life. If you often forget to lock your iPhone, then you should do this.  Go to Settings - General - AutoLock and set it for 1 Minute.

6  Disable Spotlight Search. Only a few users use Spotlight. Go and disable it to save some juice. It drains your battery updating its index. Go to Settings - General - Spotlight and turn off all.

7 Browsing in LTE or WiFi doesn't take much battery like 3G or Edge does.  This will improve your battery a lot, maybe the most improvement Tip you will find out there. Go to Settings and Turn them off if you don't use them.

8 . If you don't use the health App this will help you. As it tracks the motion of your movement which doesn't matter if you don't use it. Go to Settings - Privacy - Motion and Fitness - Fitness Tracking - Toggle Off. 

9  Fetch less frequently. If you leave your Mail Fetch every 15 minutes, it will drain your battery a lot. I leave it Manually. It is the best choice in my opinion. Go to Settings - Mail - Fetch New Data and set it to Manually. If you set it in Manually, you have to check manually for new emails.

10 Background refresh consumes a lot of juice. Go and turn it Off in Settings - General - Background App Refresh.

11 This could be a pain in the ass but it's worth it. Turn off Parallax Backgrounds. The 3D Backgrounds are cool but consume some battery. Go to Settings - General - Accessibility - Reduce Motion and turn it On

12 This also could be more pain in the ass. Darken your colors/Contrast but really worth it. Go to Setting - General - Accessibility - Increase Contrast - There are 3 Option 
Reduce Transparency - Turn On
Darken Colors - Turn On
Reduce White Point - Turn On. 
  
13 Turn Off Unnecessary Sounds and Vibration - Go to Settings - Sounds - Vibrate - Vibrate on Ring - Turn Off - Vibrate on Silent Off depends on the situations you can turn it on with all the above settings included. Scroll down to the end 
- Lock Sound - Turn Off - 
Keyboard Clicks - Turn Off. 

14 Stop reading this if you don't use Stock Email - Fetch less frequently. If you leave your Mail Fetch every 15 minutes, it will drain your battery a lot. I leave it Manually. It is the best choice in my opinion. Go to Settings - Mail - Fetch New Data and set it to Manually. If you set it in Manually, you have to check manually for new emails.

15 Turn of Wallpaper Dynamics - Use Still WallPaper as choosing Dynamic and Perpective takes a lot of Juice so it will keep still. Go to Settings - Wallpaper - Choose Pic and Choose Still. 

16 Those who are Jailbroken SmartTap takes a lot of Juice as it won't let you phone sleep as there's an activator that keeps it awake because if you double tap the screen it will turn on and those weather tweaks takes a lot of juice every second.

apple,My experience with the iPad Pro as a photographer,"Heyo, r/apple. After seeing various users from different backgrounds attempting to use the iPad Pro as their main computer, I figured I'd share my experience with the device!

Before I continue, I wrote my general perspective of the iPad Pro being a ""tablet replacement"" on my site [here](http://www.emmazed.com/blog/the-ipad-pro). I recommend reading it first so you might understand where I'm coming from.

Anyways, time to discuss a few things that I may have forgotten!

---

**On a daily basis, my MacBook allows me to do the following:**

* Handle multiple emails (from different accounts) simultaneously.
* Archive, manage, and back-up my images, invoices, documents, and Photoshop/Illustrator files.
* Extensively edit images on Adobe Lightroom &amp; Adobe Photoshop CC.
* Handle multiple Safari windows for designated tasks: research, entertainment, and managing my website.

The MacBook Pro rarely disappoints when I need to perform these tasks, so before I tried to fully inject my workflow onto the iPad Pro—though it should be obvious—I had to remind myself that it runs on iOS so various, familiar tasks are limited. But I wanted to challenge the capabilities the iOS has on the iPad Pro, so here's the good, bad, and eh.

----

***THE GOOD***

* I noticed I didn't want to use my MBP around the house since I had the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is lighter and more portable than my MBP. I took the iPad Pro everywhere with me—the shitter, my bed, the car, an on location shoot, and other places I personally wouldn't feel comfortable taking my ^heavy laptop to.

* The resolution and colour reproduction is amazing. My MBP isn't a Retina model, so the iPad Pro's screen feels/is sharper and more immersive than my MBP. I've used the 5K iMac before on gigs, and, to me, I felt like I was carrying a portable iMac, screen resolution wise.

* The Apple Pencil, **technologically**, is fucking amazing. So worth the 100 bucks. I've always carried around two notebooks with me constantly for jotting down ideas, sketching shoots, writing down things I've read, etc. And it feels so nice to have all my notes digitalised. I mean, my notebooks can be stolen, submerged in water, etc. so it's comforting to know that even if my iPad Pro is stolen, my notes are (1) locked and (2) will still be accessible on my iPhone/MacBook. ALSO, I waste less paper! My notebook is a filled with a bunch of shit I won't revisit so it's nice that I can delete notes on my iPad ""forever"".

* I didn't experience any lag whatsoever. I was watching a 5.6 GB video on VLC while doing basic edits on Adobe Photoshop Lightroom in split-screen view, and the damn thing didn't even blink.

* Because I only have an iPhone and MacBook Pro, I just buy physical books &amp; magazines, but that changed when I had the iPad Pro. I started using iBooks and Instapaper way more. It's nice being able to have two pages side-to-side in landscape mode. This isn't a new feature on the iPad Pro, but, to me, it's an unfamiliar one because I've never had an iPad before.

----

***THE BAD***

* My secondary phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and since it came with a USB adapter, I've been plugging in my flash drive to the phone when I need to access a file from my computer. I use Pushbullet to transfer links and files across all my devices, but I'm sad that the iPad Pro couldn't even open .ZIP files. Hell, I couldn't even view RAW files. Thankfully I had the GS7 Edge to handle that, but the fact that I would have to put my iPad down and pick up my phone to open a .ZIP file is saddening. I'm aware it's not an iPad Pro issue, but more-so an iOS issue. Nonetheless, it's *an* issue. 

* The iPad can loose charge while being plugged in. Sometimes I didn't have an access to a wall outlet so when I would plug my iPad Pro to my MBP, I noticed that while I used the iPad Pro, my charge would either be the same or decrease.

* The Apple Pencil, **portably**, is frustrating. It doesn't have a clip and though I carry it in my inside pockets when I have a jacket on, I've lost the damn thing twice within a month. Thankfully when I lost it, it was when I was home, but the replacement price of an Apple Pencil is $100. I don't want 2016 to be the year I spent $200 on two ""pencils"", ya feel me?

Excerpt from my linked post:

&gt; One of Adobe’s mobile creativity apps is Photoshop Lightroom, which allows you to edit, capture, and share photos. So when I would attempt to edit RAW images with the iPad Pro, I could only adjust basic tools such as exposure values, tone curves, split toning, and cropping. But I can’t solely rely on those tools with my work. I religiously rely on VSCO Film camera profiles and tools such as lens correction, adjustment brush, and spot removal. I can’t generate the desired work my clients and I want without these tools. Oh, and “fun fact”: I can’t view RAW files on the Photos app; they show up as blank images until I upload them to Photoshop Lightroom. When it comes to working on typographic projects, until I’m able to directly upload third-party sourced typefaces, I can’t use Adobe’s Comp CC to it’s full potential for my intended use. Overall, these apps are great for basic functions that most users would be content with. But the iPad Pro won’t be replacing my laptop just yet. The iPad Pro is technically capable of supporting these features, but it’s up to developer support to make these dreams come true.

***THE EH***

* The iPad Pro is too expensive for what it does. If you purchase the 256GB model w/ LTE + the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, you'll be spending $1300+ for a tablet. This is a wild generalisation, but I don't believe the average consumer—who's already comfortable with using a tablet for their specific needs—will even be willing to spent $1,000+ on a tablet. Most of my friends are in college and though they spent $1,300 on a MBP, I found it hard to convince them to spend *that* much on an iOS device, because of the flexibility OSX offers. Personally, I would rather spend that money towards the upcoming updated MacBook Pro's. 

* The 9.7-inch iPad Pro makes the 12.9-inch iPad Pro–a six-month-old device—seem inferior. I mean, better resolution cameras (great for scanning PDF's/receipts), True Tone display (which I've witnessed and was impressed by), and other goodies make me feel like the only reason why it would replace a laptop is because of it's size. Because of it's size, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro feels like a laptop companion.

* I wish Safari on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro would, by default, display web pages in Desktop View. Mobile webpage scaling on the iPad Pro isn't consistent.

----

As I said in my linked post, the iPad Pro is a great start towards tablets replacing a laptop for the average consumer; it's a device that could be for anyone, but not everyone. Going forward, I'm gonna to try to use a newly refreshed MacBook before saving towards the upcoming MacBook Pro's. I hope that this post might help some of you that are on the fence about buying an/which iPad Pro!

apple,Managing Music on a 16GB iPhone,"I have a 16GB iPhone. I've never had trouble with the limited space. The main thing is clearing out the photos and videos frequently, and managing music. 
  
I have about 200 songs on my phone at any given time, but I don't do any manual selection. Here's my smart playlist setup:
1) 1 Month playlist - anything bought/added within the last month is automatically on the phone.   
2) 3 Month playlist - anything within the last 3 months with a minimum play count of 10.   
3) 6 Month playlist - 6 months fresh, minimum play count of 20.   
4) 1 Year - minimum play count of 60 or so.   
5) 2 Year - minimum play count of 120 or so.   
6) Lifetime - limited to top 50 songs played.   
  
Using these playlists, I rarely am missing what I want to listen to. The individual user might want to adapt the lower bar for play counts, but the idea remains: set the bar wherever you need to to find the sweet spot between:  
1) taking up minimal space  
2) having the songs you want on your phone

apple,Wouldn't it be awesome if your Apple TV could stream audio to your iPhone's headphones?,"I love my Apple TV but I find myself watching most of my media via my Playstation 4, for the simple reason that my wife and I can get our kid to bed and [pop our headphones into a couple of wireless PS4 controllers](http://i.imgur.com/qbG9fyx.jpg) and crank up the volume without waking our son. Anyone with young kids (or easily-irritated neighbors) can probably appreciate how liberating it is to be able to enjoy a non-kid-friendly movie or show without worrying about volume.

I have a dream that someday, somehow, we could do the same thing - have the audio from Apple TV routed to two (or more) iPhones wirelessly, using the EarPods (or whatever) we all already own. I've had 3 iTunes Movie Rental credits collecting dust in my Apple TV for months because it's just a better experience watching movies on my PS4, due to the wireless headphone option.

Rant over, but I'd love to know if you guys agree (or if you have any elegant solutions to this problem!).

**TL;DR:**

*I hope my dream isn't ignored*

*To have streaming sound while the kid snores*

*To have wireless sound*

*For all my friends around*

*Without having to use my PS4*



PS Yes I know that newer Apple TV's can pair to bluetooth headphones, but:

* As far as I can tell, this only works to stream audio to **one pair of headphones at a time** - not great for watching with a friend or S.O. (**EDIT**: A lot of folks in the comments seem to be missing this point - it's the ability to stream wirelessly to two or more separate sets of headphones at once that's crucial here)
* Many people (myself included) don't own bluetooth headphones
* Many people (myself included) DO own an iPhone and some earbuds
* AirPlay technology is already a 'known thing,' which could probably be adapted to suit this idea",159,383,2016-04-26,AAPL,0.030028749257326126,0.9347222447395325,0.035248950123786926

apple,Tip for 12inch Macbook users. Two apps have revolutionised how I use my rMB. One creates Picture in Picture floating video which follows you between full-screen apps/desktops. The other is a file drop which allows you to drag multiple files and folders between full-screen desktops.,"The two apps are: 

* Helium - floating video window. Edit: Been informed Fluid Browser does this too and you can always change preferences in ITunes to keep the video window above all others.

* Dropshelf- allow you to drop a file or folder on shelf which is available between windows",56,178,2016-04-28,AAPL,0.11618207395076752,0.8642272353172302,0.01959061622619629

apple,First week with the m7 MacBook,"So the MacBook is *VERY* capable of being an Exec/College student laptop. Its very small, ultra portable and powerful enough to do the most common tasks. Its not a video encoding system but very good at doing 99% of end user tasks, Office, Web Browsing. It is good enough to run a Windows10 VM via Virtual box as well.

My usage is closer to 6 hours and not 8-10 hours which is normal. Considering the size six hours is still damn good for real world usage.

The “Cable Envy” problems only having one USB-C port is accurate but almost completely resolved by OWC’s USB-C docking station. It has enough ports to make it the perfect companion ($165) isn’t awful considering it adds 10 ports including your HDMI out port and additional USB 3 ports.

The only compliant I can say is the 12” screen doesn’t give you a ton of real estate but by shrinking the size down it is acceptable. But with the USB-C -&gt; HDMI cable works but then you are running on the battery. By doing the USB-C dock that fixes all of the short comings as using it on the desk without having to carry around a ton of cables with the ultra-light laptop.

The laptop is the thickness of the DVD drive in the Lenovo laptop that work provided me. The Lenovo was $1100. The rMB is $1299 without AppleCare.

The hinge on the MB only allows about 110 degrees so you are somewhat limited on the range in case you are sitting right on top of it in an airplane but you would have to prop up the front to get in a usable angle. The screen viewing angle isn’t impacted all the way to 170 degrees or so other then it severely impacts the ability to view it but it doesn’t “black” out when you hit the extreme viewing angles as other laptops but its not especially usable considering. Looking at it from 45degrees either way of center it is excellent.

The speakers are very large sounding and impressive considering the size of the laptop in general. No these aren't Elac quality speakers but the thickest part of the laptop is 1/2"".

* Powerful enough to do 99% of what most users use a laptop for
* Not powerful enough to transcode videos but that is where you would have a Mac(Book) Pro for really big jobs. Yes you can edit videos on the laptop but the limited real estate even by cranking up the screen scaling doesn't leave a ton of room to do anything else.
* It is $200 too high for the base model for a MacBook as it is fairly close to the starting price of the MacBook Pro 13""
* It is tiny and truly a portable powerhouse
* Battery life is good considering the size and could come close to six hours of real world usage which is great but it won't get you nine hours in the real world.
* the MacBook only includes the 29 Watt USB-C wall adapter and didn't include the $19 extension cable like they did with the rMBP.

I went from a 2013 i7 Retina MacBook Pro to the 2016 m7 MacBook and this is damn near a perfect system. I'm powering a 27"" 1920x1080 monitor on my desk for screen real estate and it is a very usable system. I do a lot of video transcoding and it can be done on the MacBook but it will tear through the battery life so it isn't recommended for high energy consumption tasks. Yes, I could edit a 1080p video on the MacBook in a pinch but I wouldn't recommend using it day in and day out for this task.

I've been blown away by the power in such a tiny package and I gave up my work provided laptop and using the MB as my full time replacement laptop. I have a 5k iMac for video editing and transcoding as I couldn't drop the phat cash on the Mac Pro. The 5k iMac &amp; MacBook in total is still less then the configuration for the Mac Pro running on three year old chips. Hopefully a refresh comes soon but until I'm ready to move up to the 12 core Mac Pro I'm going to be in nervona with my current choices.",396,437,2016-04-30,AAPL,0.05212140083312988,0.9147708415985107,0.033107683062553406

iphone,Went from a 6s+ to an SE,"I got my iPhone 6s+ back in December. While I loved the screen size, the phone was just too bulky for me during everyday use. 

So after thinking about it for a month, I decided to downsize quite a bit to an iPhone SE.

I've had it for a few hours now and couldn't be happier. The smaller keyboard will take a few days to get used to , but other than that, I love it.

I love that it can easily fit in one hand. I love that it easily slides in and out of my pocket and I love how inconspicuous it feels.
