apple,My experience with the Apple Store tonight.,"I bought a new 13"" MacBook Air on 2/12.  Within the last few weeks, it's had inconsistent issues with the login screen not immediately coming up when I wake it from sleep, and the right USB port wasn't always detecting thumb drives.

I took it into the Apple Store last Thursday, when they tried to run their diagnostics, it kept locking at the same point.  They were almost certain it was a logic board issue, so they scheduled me to bring it back this afternoon (I wanted an evening to take a TM snapshot and blow it away to remove my files).  I come into the store after work, talked to a different tech, who tries the diagnostics again.

He also says it's probably the logic board, but since I'm past my initial 60-day window, it will most likely have to be checked in and fixed versus just swapping it out.  As he's doing his thing, he comes across my purchase history and his eyes widen.  *A half-dozen iPhones, 2 Mac Minis, a PowerBook G4, 2 MacBook Pros, a PowerMacG5, the MacBook Air in question, 1 Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Expresses.*

He goes in the back, and brings out a brand new, sealed MBA.  Sure, I was a few weeks past the 60-day point, but this guy went above and beyond.  Oh, and my warranty started over.

**Pro-Tip**: It's very important to register your hardware, kids.

iphone,"iPhone left at my bar last night. Help me reunite it with its owner, Reddit!!!","I bartend at a neighborhood tavern here in Chicago. Last night near closing, two guys pull in and belly up for a nightcap. They were really cool, I enjoyed talking to them for the brief time they were there, but, unfortunately, minor crises ensued: I dropped their tab, they paid it (and tipped well), but they split so fast that one of 'em forgot to grab his iPhone and take it with him. I noticed it pretty quickly and tried to flag them down before they drove off, but wasn't able to. Rather than leave it at the bar and risk it being lost in the shuffle there, I brought it home with me. Now, it's almost noon, and no one's called or texted trying to retrieve it. I suspect that, if I wasn't still kinda woozy from lack of sleep, I could open up the phone and maybe figure out how to make contact with the owner, but I figured it'd be faster/easier to impose upon the hive mind. SO, please, Reddit, do your thing now and help me do some good! Tell me how I should get in touch with the poor owner of this iPhone 4 who's probably somewhere crying his eyes out over the loss of his baby as you read this. Thanks!

iphone,Just another reason why I LOVE OtterBox.,"Before I got my iPhone 4S, I had a 3GS for 2 years.  I used the OtterBox defender, and my phone had no scratches and basically looked brand new by the time my contract was up and I could get a new phone.  I put my phone through a lot, too, including wildland firefighting, trail running, and general clumsiness.

When I got the new iPhone, I got another OtterBox defender case because I just loved the protection it gave me.  However, I noticed that the part that was supposed to cover the dock connecter never stayed closed, and after thinking it was just a lousier version of the OtterBox update for the 4S, I saw that a friend's case closed with ease.

So I emailed OtterBox and included a video showing the difficulties I was having in closing the Dock connector, and without hesitation, AND on a Sunday, they emailed me back saying they are sending a new case, for FREE!

So, I know that OtterBox has a warranty guarantee, but lately, what brand doesn't?  I don't have a lot of experience complaining to customer service in companies; I was honestly expecting an email describing to me how to close my case properly, or saying that I damaged it in some way and it was not covered by the warranty.  I never expected to get a new phone case.

OtterBox customer service prevails!",18,34,2012-05-06,AAPL,0.03260837495326996,0.9236233830451965,0.0437682680785656

apple,"[PSA] Always make sure you disconnect your iPhone/iPad from AirPlay when you're finished watching video, or end up embarrassed like me...","**TL;DR at the bottom**

I have an Apple TV 2 and an iPhone. I regularly use AirPlay to display videos from my phone to my living room TV via the Apple TV 2.
My wife and I  have used my iPhone to record ourselves being... ""intimate"" (don't bother preaching about the risks involved in having such things on your phone. I'm well aware, and I've taken every measure possible to secure my iPhone). 

This is great for me because I travel frequently, and sometimes my wife and I will watch the videos to ""get in the mood"".

Yesterday afternoon my my wife and I were in the living room, getting a little frisky, so I proposed we throw one of the videos up onto the TV screen. She was into it, so I started to AirPlay a video of our last recorded intimate experience. Unfortunately, we didn't get very far before our doorbell rang. It was her parents. They had arrived at our house a bit early to start their evening of babysitting our daughter for us so we could attend a friend's birthday party at a local restaurant.

So, we went to the party, had a good time (dinner, drinks etc.) and returned home at about 11 p.m.

My in-laws were lounging in the living room, watching Tinker Tailor: Soldier Spy. They said that they only had about 30 minutes remaining until the movie was over, so they said they would let themselves out when it was over. So we said our goodnights and headed up to our room.

Both my wife and I had the same thing on our mind (*hint- sex*) since earlier that evening, so, after undressing and hopping into bed, I whipped out my... iPhone... and pulled up the video we had started watching earlier.

As we lay there, staring at the screen, I was initially confused as to why the video progress bar was moving, but the screen wasn't displaying the video... 

[This is what was showing on my iPhone (edited to it's SFW)](http://i.imgur.com/BFW6F.jpg) ...

- ***TL;DR***  **Forgot to turn off AirPlay after streaming a video, to the living room TV, of my wife and I ""doin' it"" , and accidentally streamed it to the TV later that day when my in-laws were at our house watching a movie...**

**Update**- *As we were lying there in the bed, and the realization of what was happening hit me, I immediately stopped playback and disabled airplay. I laid there frozen, stunned.*

*My wife didn't understand what had happened, so she was asking me, ""what happened, why'd you turn it off"" still in a playful mood. I was deciding whether to tell her what happened, as I tried to recall what point the video was at when it may have been AirPlaying to the living room TV.*

*I didn't say anything, and I pulled the video back up (double-checking to make sure AirPlay was disabled), and pressed play. When the video resumed, the scene was not full-on pornographic, as it was a point in which we were both moving/adjusting, and the camera was mostly showing the surrounding room. I scrubbed the video back a few seconds (10-20) and was somewhat relieved to see that there's a 75% chance that her parents didn't see anything too graphic.*

*From what I saw in the section of video that most-likely played through the TV, they may have see my topless wife (their daughter), but no actual ""sex"".*

*So, I didn't explain to my wife that her parents had probably seen a few seconds of our home sex tape. I just told her that the video was paused, and still connected to the Apple TV, but that I didn't think it had played before I reverted it to the iPhone.*

*We didn't go downstairs to confront them. We just let them finish their movie, and let themselves out.*

*They haven't said anything to either of us about it yet.*

*Fingers crossed!*

Jobs went to a whiteboard and showed that if there were five million people using the Mac, and it took ten seconds extra to turn it on every day, that added up to 300 million or so hours per year that people would save, which was the equivalent of at least 100 lifetimes saved per year.

I'm 17 and I just launched a new iPad app called Peekaboo Prank that works with an iPad 2 or newer. Peekaboo is a prank app that uses the Smart Cover to simulate playing peekaboo with a cute animal. Give it to your friend and it will display a scary animation and record their reaction with the forward-facing camera. You can then share the video via email or Facebook.

iphone,First-gen iPhone owners:  How's yours doing today?,"With the fifth anniversary coming up next month, I got mine out of the ol' drawer and reflected on what a good phone it was. It got retired in April '11 as a backup phone, but it's still great today and I kind of miss using it.  Today, the battery is pretty weak - it loses charge quickly during the day, even when it's not in use.  Even when it's fully shut down, it still loses charge after a few days in the drawer.  Somehow, the vibration motor got loose inside the phone, rattling around any time you pick it up, and of course it's a bit slower than it used to be.  

But dammit, it still works well.  The screen is just as responsive as day one, the speaker's stayed the same, the wifi doesn't have any problems, and it's even perfectly capable of web browsing.  It's been dropped a number of times, but (other than the vibration motor) I've never needed to work on it.  It's helped that its lived its entire life in a case, but damn son, most electronics can't make it this far and still work well.

apple,How to play Dungeon Keeper 2 in OS X Lion,"Playing one of my favourite Bullfrog games, Dungeon Keeper 2. I thought some other people might be interested in how I got it running. This game has been plagued with crashes and been nearly unplayable for a very long time. But it seems to be running now very well with my configuration, no crashes.

OS X Lion 10.7.3

Install Wine (a windows emulator). This script got me started, if you don't trust it then just open it up and have a read. This script takes hours to complete, it downloads, builds and installs. There are no precompiled solutions that I know of which work on Lion. If the script fails for any reason it will stop and you'll have to come back and get it started running again after you fix the problem.

http://code.google.com/p/lion-winebuilder/

After this finishes it will ask you to update your ~/.bash_profile file with a few paths. Download Dungeon Keeper 2 from GOG.com, it is on sale until the end of this weekend for 50% off. So that's $3.

If you buy it somewhere else then you have to download a crack for it because wine doesn't handle most DRM very well.

http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/dungeon_keeper_2

Source your bash_profile so that the changes you made can be seen by the current Terminal instance.

    source ~/.bash_profile

Run the exe in Terminal to install.

    wine setup_dungeon_keeper_2.exe

After it installs, open the wine configuration utility.

    winecfg

apple,Today I got a lesson in Apple build quality...,"So, my well hammered keyboard on my MBP lets it down and the backlight hasn't been working for some time so I decided to change them. 

As I have a business repairing and refurbing laptops I decided to DIY it.

Using the iFixit guide, I had the job done in about an hour. What got me when I was doing this is just how well put together these things are and how well they're planned out. There is belt and braces on everything. Even cable guides for such as the screen cable  which are a bit of plastic on even the high end laptops are alloy on these. 

But what really amazed  me was when I removed the backlight film and got to the keyboard screws. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIFTY OF THE BLOODY THINGS if not more. No wonder the keyboard feels so solid despite being able to roll it up when you remove it. Most of the hour spent doing the job was removing and replacing all these little screws.

So whenever anyone bleats on about MBPs being overpriced, I'll point them to the iFixit guide and show them just how well they're built. I have yet to see a single Windows laptop, even the expensive £1500+ corporate ones that are as well built.",35,147,2012-05-20,AAPL,0.021262336522340775,0.8840766549110413,0.09466104209423065

apple,Locking down your system incase of theft (how to),"I was asked to create a guide on my current setup to help recover my laptop incase of theft. I warn you now this is a bit long and just text, if people want a guide with pictures or anything I can try to create that over the next few days.

My Macbook Air has 2 partitions, one that is my normal everyday partition that is encrypted with FileVault2, and a 2nd partion that has Prey (http://preyproject.com/) installed and ready to set my Mac stolen as soon as it is connected to the internet. It also has the Administrator account hidden and limits what the Standard account can do. When they first launch Safari, it also opens up Facebook, gMail, Yahoo, and Twitter to entice the thief to log into these services.

This will work on all Intel Macs but works best with the newer models that do don't allow you to reset the Open Firmware password by messing with the ram. Any Mac that is a MacBook Air (Late 2010), MacBook Pro (Early 2011), and iMac (Mid 2011) and up will be work. The MacBooks of 2011 should also be this way but I can't find a source. 


**WARNING** If you have one of the listed models above or higher, and forget your Open Firmware password you will need to take it to an Apple store to reset the password.


Now on to the guide. It's best if you follow this guide to dual-boot Mountain Lion and just replace Mountain Lion with Lion or whatever OS you want to use as your trap partition. One thing to keep in mind, I found it was best to not have any partitions encrypted yet, so if you're already running FileVault2 you'll need to remove the encryption on it before proceeding.


Also be sure to set your Open Firmware password when you are at the Lion installation screen. At the Welcome screen choose ""Firmware Password Utility"" from the ""Utilities"" menu and proceed as directed. After that continue the installation as described.


http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/19/dual-boot-os-x-10-7-lion-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion/


Also instead of giving it 16gb you can give it 10gb, we will be able to shrink it later on. 

After you have installed the trap OS and itrunning you should have already created your original Administrator account. You should now create 1 user named ""Apple"" or whatever you want to be a standard user, this will be the account that the computer will automatically log into. The next account you want to create is your hidden Administrator. You will need to open up the Terminal application for this and then run the following commands. When you first type the command it will ask for a password, it will be the password that you set for your Administrator account.

    sudo dscl . create /Groups/YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME
    sudo dscl . create /Groups/YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME PrimaryGroupID 400
    sudo dscl . create /Users/YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME PrimaryGroupID 400
    sudo dscl . create /Users/YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME UniqueID 400
    sudo dscl . create /Users/YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME UserShell /bin/bash
    sudo dscl . passwd /Users/YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME YOUR_USER_PASSWORD
    sudo dscl . append /Groups/YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME GroupMembership 400
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow Hide500Users -bool TRUE
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow HiddenUsersList -array YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool FALSE


Be sure to change YOUR_NEW_USER_NAME and YOUR_USER_PASSWORD with the username and password you want to use. The above commands are doing exactly what the Users &amp; Groups preference in the System Preferences is doing, except we are not creating a Home Directory, and we are manually setting the Group and User ID to 400. Then we enable a setting in OS X that hides users that have an ID lower than 500.


Now with that account created you want to go into the Users &amp; Group panel, and click Login Options. Turn on automatic login and select it to log into your fake account ""Apple"" in my example. Logout and login as your fake user. Go back to the Login Options and click the lock if it is in the lock position and then use your hidden account username and password to remove your original Administrator account. After that is completed, click the lock again to make sure it's in the locked position.


With the users taken care of you want to now go into the Startup Disk in System Preferences, make sure the trap partition is selected and that the lock is again in the locked position. This will prevent the thief from being able to change the boot order on your laptop. 


At this point it is time to install Prey. Go ahead and download it with the fake account, when it asks for permission to install it, put in your hidden admins username and password and everything should install.


Now with Prey installed if your laptop does get stolen you'll still need to mark it as such. However we can setup a script so that your fake partition will attempt to do so if the thief connect the device to the internet. We will need to setup a LaunchDaemon and create a script for it to run.


Before getting the script ready, we want to get a few things from your OpenPrey account. Your API key found at http://panel.preyproject.com/profile and your DeviceID found after you click your device the URL should be something like ""http://panel.preyproject.com/devices/SIBDSD"", so in this case your DeviceID would be SIBDSD.


Open Terminal once again, and type ""*su YOUR_ADMIN_NAME*"". Once you're logged into your admin user, run ""*sudo su*"", this will now have you running as root. Type ""*nano /usr/bin/prey.sh*"" it will open up a command line text editor, just copy and paste the script below, then to save press ""Ctrl + X"", then ""Y"", and then press ""Enter"". You should now be back at the command line. Then type ""*chmod +x /usr/bin/prey.sh*"". The last thing to do is to create the LaunchDaemon and have that run.

Be sure to change the API and DEVICE ID with yours.

**&lt;--Copy after this for /usr/bin/prey.sh contents--&gt;**

    #!/bin/bash
    API_KEY=""DF2323""; //replace this with yours
    DEVICE_ID=""SIBDSD""; //replace this with yours
    curl --user $API_KEY:x ""http://control.preyproject.com/devices/$DEVICE_ID.xml"" -X PUT -d ""device[missing]=1"";

**&lt;--Copy before this for /usr/bin/prey.sh contents--&gt;**

Creating the LaunchDaemon, I named mine ""com.jaku.prey.plist"" but you could have ""jaku"" replaced with pretty much anything. So let's again run ""*nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jaku.prey.plist*"" or whatever you want to call it, just be sure to replace jaku in the file as well. Then  press ""Ctrl + X"", then ""Y"", and then press ""Enter"" again to save.

**&lt;--Copy after this for /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jaku.prey.plist contents--&gt;**

    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd""&gt;
    &lt;plist version=""1.0""&gt;
         &lt;dict&gt;
           &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
       &lt;string&gt;com.jaku.prey&lt;/string&gt;
           &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
           &lt;array&gt;
              &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/prey.sh&lt;/string&gt;
           &lt;/array&gt;
           &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;
           &lt;string&gt;/dev/null&lt;/string&gt;
           &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt;
           &lt;string&gt;/dev/null&lt;/string&gt;
           &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;
           &lt;integer&gt;300&lt;/integer&gt;
           &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
           &lt;true/&gt;
         &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;/plist&gt;

**&lt;--Copy before this for /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jaku.prey.plist contents--&gt;**

Once you are all done with that you'll need to register the LaunchDaemon with this command ""*launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jaku.prey*"". After that the /usr/bin/prey.sh script will run every 5 minutes and try to mark your laptop as stolen. 

After this run the following command a few times, ""*history -c &amp;&amp; exit*"" basically run it until you are logged out of your terminal. This will wipe all the commands from history that you just ran so that no one can figure out what you just did.

You are almost done now!

Log into your original partition, you will need to hold down the ""Option"" key on startup to choose your original partition, and it will ask for the Open Firmware password you set earlier. Once you are in your original partition, go into System Preferences and click ""Startup Disk"", like before you may have to unlock it but make sure that the disk selected is the trap partition. After that we can now go into the ""Disk Utility"" program and resize the trap partition to a smaller partition. You might want to delete some Apps from it that are not necessary but this is another guide for another time. Once it is resized you can now (re)enable FileVault2 on your original partition.

The only thing left to do after this is to test the machine, make sure that when it first boots up it always logs into the trap partition and that for you to get into the real one you need to hold down Option and type in your password. 

I should mention, I'm thinking of trying to do this in a recovery partition as well so that it uses less space and so that I could try to share the image. Not sure if it's possible yet, but it seems like it could be.",19,120,2012-05-24,AAPL,0.05489048113425573,0.9124777714411417,0.03263173686961333

ipad,The iPad Jailbreaker's guide to must-have addons!,"So the chronic dev team and iphone dev team have released the latest jailbreak for all devices running ios 5.1.1
And if you're like me and you're a person who is already familiar with jailbreaking and it's become a huge part in your ios experience then you've probably been eagerly awaiting the latest jailbreak in order to truly enjoy the new ipad to it's fullest  potential.

So I've been enjoying the fruits of the iphone dev team and more recently chronic dev teams labor since the very first jailbreak available for the iphone 3G. I've been tweaking my phone a lot since then. and like I said, it has now become a necessity in order for me to really enjoy ios to the fullest.

I wanted to share a list of tweaks, some more essential than others, that I've put on my iPad, (some which I've been using on my iPhone for years now) that i've found make the experience more efficient, more productive and overall more enjoyable.

Why jailbreaking is so important (to me)

iOS is a really nice mobile operating system, but in some areas I can't help but feel that only the bare minimum was done. A lot of the time I'll be doing something in iOS only to ask myself in frustration,""Ugh, why can't I do this!"" or ""Why do I have to do it this way?!""

Fortunately for myself and many others, there are a number very talented developers who are capable of creatively addressing these issues. A lot of these tweaks will make you wish for apple to implement them one day. 

Without further ado, here is a list of tweaks that all jailbreakers (especially you newbies) should be aware of!

The essentials:

1) SBSettings from Bigboss - Free

Sbsettings use to be the tweak if you were going to jailbreak your idevice. It really brought to my attention early on what developers could achieve on iOS. SBSettings very conveniently places important setting toggles such as your data connections, bluetooth, and even a slider for your brightness right on your springboard. Just evoke the window (by default sliding on the status bar, customizable in activator..more on that later) and you're ready to quickly change any of the available settings normally only accessible by going into the settings app itself. And it's fully themeable! This use to be the tweak I used in order to convince my friends that owned iphones to jailbreak their devices. 
Since the introduction of notification center in iOS 5, SBSettings toggles can be placed into the N.C. itself, giving you the option of whether you want a separate sbsettings drop down window. I personally have replaced SBSettings with intelliscreenX, though sbsettings still serves a vital purpose as it gives you the ability to toggle mobilesubstrate addons (allowing you to disable your tweaks without uninstalling them.)

2) Activator from Ryan Petrich - Free

Activator is an amazing tweak that adds a whole slew of gesture based options to improve your iOS experience. Essentially you select a gesture (from a long list of available ones–ex. doubletap status bar, pinch springboard…) to act as a shortcut for you to toggle/access practically anything on your phone (sbsetting toggles, specific app options (like skipping to the next track in itunes), system options (simulate pressing the home button), or even launch an app! Activator even gives you the option to choose where these shortcuts can be triggered from. It's really hard to describe in words, but it truly is one of the essential tweaks for any iDevice.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91WDGeI7vNw

3) FolderEnhancer from Ashikase - $ 
FolderEnhancer is one of those tweaks that makes you wish it was just natively available in iOS. Amongst many other options, FolderEnhancer frees your folder from size limitations (now allowing for pages upon pages of apps) as well as enabling the ability to store folders in folders. You can even adjust the appearance. Simplify your spring with this essential tweak!
Note: You're probably going to want the No Folder Badges tweak from chpwn (free) to eliminate any possible annoyance.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pCRh7gcAOs
 
4) Multicleaner from da_petcu21 - $0.99

The description of this tweak is as blunt as it is well said. ""Because iOS multitasking sucks…""
Multicleaner is another one of my essential tweaks that I simply cannot live without. Configure the multitasking bar in any number of ways to make it work the way you want!  Now, there are many tweaks available for ios' multitasking bar, some even free, but this one is without a doubt the best one in all of cydia. It gives you all the options you could ever want; my personal favorites are 
a)reorder the icons without having to go into edit mode.
b)don't just minimize out of apps, quit apps with a simple activator gesture (by default, holding the home button) 
c)show current app in switcher (I was always bothered with how as long as you were in the app, it would be hidden from switcher)
d)SWIPE APP OUT OF SWITCHER BAR TO CLOSE IT! Definitely my favorite option! Sometimes I find myself with countless apps open and instead of having to go into edit mode I can now slide them out the switcher bar like a bashing a puck in a game of air hockey!


5) MultiIconMover from Ashikase - free

Another tweak that should be available natively in iOS. Move multiple icons on the springboard simply by going into edit mode, tapping each icon to make a checkmark appear, and then hitting the home button once you are ready to replace them. Simple.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw113ikksmg

6) Swipebright from IanP - $0.99

A new favorite of mine, Swipebright allows for the quick adjustment of the brightness instantly just by swiping your finger horizontally on the status bar. There are plenty of options available which is surprising because I found swipebright was pretty instantly perfect. Ain't no harm in making a good thing better!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77url7WRcm0

7) Zephyr from chpwn - $2.99

Another new tweak that I instantly fell in love with, zephyr improves on the iPads native multitouch controls and allows for more intuitive way to handle your multitasking. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen will pull up the switcher bar, swiping left to right will switch between apps. You can adjust the number of fingers you have to use and you can even disable it during certain applications. Quite simply, but incredibly useful

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6QuF2OB1og

8) IntelliScreenX from intelliborn - $9.99

Check your mail, rss feed, twitter, Facebook and even toggles for the most common system settings and more!
IntelliScreenX adds a plethora of new features to the notification center. This tweak is incredibly well done and definitely worth every penny. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYhR9b9MPHQ

9) iFile from Carsten Heineit - $

An incredibly important app, iFile is the ultimate iOS file system explorer. 
You can even start up a web server with one touch so you can transfer files to and from your idevice without ever plugging it into your computer. Very cool.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f91YSPfdRe0

10) Fullscreen [safari] for iPad from Yllier - $

This tweak improves safari immensely and in my opinion makes it better than all of the browsers you can find in the appstore. I wish apple would have done something like this to keep safari from being so boring. Add multitouch gestures to control the browser or use the actionpopup for quick access to the (customizable) browser controls.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRUdlTILxc

11) Adblocker from Yllier - $

Adblocker for safari as well as other apps. Can't live without adblocker on my computer, and I'm glad I don't have to live without it on my mobile devices.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCtm6vPWdxg

12) Scrollingboard from Elias Limneos - $

Scrollingboard is a tweak that completely transforms your dock. This add-on will give you paged scrolling of your icons on your dock as well as giving you extra functionality with downloadable addons. This is an incredibly well done tweak and one of the most expensive. Definitely worth checking out.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgEr5Jjdi1o

The Honorable mentions

i) Apptivator from n00neimp0rtant - 

Assign activator actions onto app icons. Terrific for clearing up space on your springboard. Use by double tapping icon to launch. My favorites are double tap appstore to open cydia, settings to open file, and alienblue to open flipboard.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ys_PIsItmk

ii) Blutrol  from r. Wetzel &amp; M. Ringwald - 

Control your favorite games with the iCade arcade Cabinet. Pretty simple! Find a game that doesn't support your iCade, take a picture while in game and set the control functions in the blutrol app. Support for more controllers, including the Phonejoy, coming soon in version 2.0!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh9Cf6kSoz4

iii) Springtomize from FilippoBiga - $2.99

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5nQO1inag

Customize your springboard to make it look and feel the way you want. Tons of options- Favorites include Turning notification transparent, removing the newsstand icon and replacing the dock with no dock.

note: If you want to remove newsstand without paying for a tweak, use NoNewsIsGoodNews

iv) Software Update Killer from  Lunatik - free

Disable software update; hide app badges.

v) NoLockScreen from Tom Zickel - free
Disables lock screen. Locking and unlocking your device shoots you right into springboard, no slide to unlock necessary.

vi) OpenNotifier from n00neimp0rtant - free

Add status bar icons to push apps. I prefer this over getting some noise or dialog box.

vii) Protube HD from Jonas Gessner - $

Complete Feature-filled youtube app for ipad.
Note: use in tandem with Open in Protube for best experience.

apple,"I just applied for a job at The Apple Store as a ""Creative"". Do any current or former store employees care to share what the interview process is like and what it's like to work in a store?","I live in Ottawa, Ontario, and apparently a new Apple Store is opening soon so they are seeking to fill most positions. I applied as a ""Creative"" because I am a musician with an extensive teaching background and I've been using Apple products personally and professionally for about 20 years.

Mostly I'm interested in what the interview process is like and what it's like working in an Apple Store. My experience and background makes me a natural fit and from what I can tell I think the wage will be acceptable in the current job market. So I figure I'll make it to at least the first stage, whatever that might be.

Please share your stories, current and former Apple Store people!

**EDIT:** I am simply amazed by the response here. Thank you so much all who have taken the time to share your knowledge and experiences with me (and anyone else who might find this thread). I have no idea if I even want the job now but I think I want to go through the interview process just to see what it's like. I don't expect I'll even get a call back (overqualified and just plain OLD) but this has been enlightening.

So I spend Sunday evening scouring google for answers and try every possible solution to no avail. Monday morning I call Apple, after lugging through the robotic crap that is modern customer support I got through to one of the most friendly people I had ever heard (I know they're paid to sound like that but it's still nice) after providing him with details of my problem he immediately promised me a new ipad within 7 days and apologized for my inconvenience. 

The thing is my 'problem' was simply a single stuck pixel in the middle of the screen, a problem which is very common with LCD panel's and not usually covered by any warranty.

apple,Tim Cook on fragmentation and screen sizes (From DX conference),"While reading the liveblogs from the DX Conference tonight, I came across Tim Cook's opinion about fragmentation and thought it appropriate for the swirling rumours about screen size.

-----

10:00 pm Walt: So along those lines, one thing that's happening on the Android side, and the OEMs... they're looking to make fewer models...

10:01 pm Tim: I wonder where they got that idea...

10:02 pm Walt: They're looking to focus. Even given the Galaxy S II, they're probably the best selling Android phone. But they haven't had a phone that's a single model that's been a hit like the iPhone. But you have this hit, but it's a single model. That's not the way you did it with the iPod or the Mac. Why don't you have more than one iPhone or more than one iPad?

10:03 pm Tim: Our North Star is to make the best product. Our goal isn't to make the design for this price point or this schedule, or line up other things, or to have x number of phones. It's to build the best. There's not a policy or commandment that 'I shalt have one phone...', it's about making the best. If we find we can do more than one... but do we have to?

**10:03 pm Tim: One thing is that we're not fragmented. Look at the percentage of users who upgraded to iOS 5. We have one App Store. We have one phone with one screen size, one resolution. So it's pretty simple if you're a developer.**

I know Apple could very easily turn around and surprise everybody, but isn't this a big hint that the 'taller iPhone' rumours are nonsense?

(It's obviously pretty clear that he knows about the 3GS and 4/4S having a different resolution, but the proportions are still the same!)
