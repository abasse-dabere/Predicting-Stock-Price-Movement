apple,Anyone else fed up with gaming on the ipad?,"It seems like most games or at least the fast pace action ones are too reliant on touch screen controls with no margin for error. When touch screen controls, like the joy pad are not the most accurate. For instance the game ""smash cops."" Precision is vital in this game to detain and arrest enemies, and its so gaaddam hard to attain 5 stars with the touch controls. Either that or the developer has made the game ridiculously hard so I get fed up enough and pay more money to unlock all the features.

Thats another thing, buying games feels like im buying a damn demo. Hardly any developer is upfront with what your purchasing. All games have an in game store, and you gotta pay out the ass for the most legit items. Wtf developers??? 

So my real question, what are some iPad games that are not heavyily dependent on touch controls( I know this limits games to mostly strategy and cards, but im done with joypad games) and the most full featured games out there.

I am having one hell of a time getting used to using the damn thing. Just for the fun of it I though I’d see about the possibility of exchanging it for a Tackpad if possible as I'm used to it on my MBP. Nice fellow by the name of Mike listened to me whine and then asked if I’d wait on hold for a minute or two. He came back and said they will ship out a Trackpad to me for FREE and I could just keep the Magic Mouse too, because I might get used to it if I used it more.

iphone,iTunes Match: A warning,"A Word of Warning

Hi there r/iPhone, this is a word of warning for anyone using iTunes Match.  The other night, I restored my phone from a jailbreak, and went to bed.  Before going to sleep, I queued a number of songs to download from iTunes Match, as it was faster than transferring over USB, and I also wanted to turn off my computer.  The songs began downloading over Wi-Fi, so I locked the screen and went to sleep.  I assumed that the download would continue over Wi-Fi (as with apps), and then close the Wi-Fi connection after they had completed.

Late the next day, I got a message from Telstra (my telecom provider), who informed me that I had gone over my monthly 1GB of data, and was currently sitting at 295% of that 1GB.  Because of my incorrect assumption that the songs being downloaded from iTunes Match would continue over Wi-Fi, I now have quite a substantial bill next month.

My warning to you is this: if you are on a limited data plan and you want to download from iTunes Match over Wi-Fi, don’t lock the screen, unless you feel like dealing with the consequences of excess usage.",42,111,2012-02-14,AAPL,0.1100550964474678,0.8682200312614441,0.021724915131926537

iphone,Just finished my first app. Here's 100 free copies.,"**UPDATE 02/17 5:06 PM**

Alright, I've got to stop at 200 copies.

This has been amazing.

For those of you I didn't get to, the app is available in the App Store here:

http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-radio/id493576794?ls=1&amp;mt=8

Thanks again for everything!

**UPDATE 02/17 11:20 AM**

This is awesome. I did not expect to make it to the top of the page, or to have this post last so long.

Since last night, you all have given me some really great feedback on the app, a couple of really flattering reviews in iTunes, a really great bug fix, some excellent suggestions for new features, some new podcasts to add to the directory and even some CSS code to make my website look better.

Not only that, but about 80 of you went ahead and bought the app at full price, even though I was giving it away for free here.

Minus the cost of yesterday's gifts, this left me with about $30.

So I thought I'd take that money and pay it back to you guys. So here are another 100 free copies.

I'm going to work my way through the people who PM'd me yesterday but didn't get a copy. Then I'll start working through new requests.

So again, **PM me your iTunes email and I'll gift you a copy of my new app.**

**UPDATE 02/16 8:55 PM**

Holy crap! That was amazing!

Thanks so much for all your interest!

This morning, the only people using the app were me and my immediate family. I can't tell you how excited I am to know that it's actually out in the world now, being used by 130+ people!

Thanks for all the great feedback! And an especially big thanks to everyone who purchased the app! I really appreciate it!

Cheers!

**Original Post:**

[Cross post from r/software. Comments said you guys might appreciate this over at r/iphone.]

I just finished my first app (it's a podcasting application for the iPhone called [Little Radio](http://littleradioapp.tumblr.com/)) and I want to share it with as many of you as possible.

It didn't feel like a gift to just make it free for a day, so I'm gifting it to people via my iTunes account.

~~**PM me your iTunes email and I'll gift it to you.**~~ It costs me $.30 to do this each time, so I'll be capping it at 100 copies.

New for this time around, a category for **accessories**.  Vote for the best cases, styluses, and other peripherals.

Guidelines to keep this working efficiently:

* Sort comments by ""top"" for best effectiveness.

* Put the App Name as the first words when nominating new apps.

* **Search** for the app before creating a new nomination. 

* **Upvote** an app title if you like it, but **please comment** (reply) if you dislike, and explain why instead of downvoting.  If possible, give alternatives you like better. 
 
* Please add a new category (or app-name) only if you don't find one.

* If the app only runs on iPad2 or requires Cydia/jailbreaking, please explicitly state as such.

apple,I can't take it anymore. (A semi-lengthy read on my experience with Android),"From the first iPhone, I knew I had fallen in love.  I jailbroke it, learned to program for 1.x, released apps and more.  Since then, I have bought the 3GS and the iPhone 4.  Though, as time went on, I began to grow bored; the platform that I loved to tinker with and explore had become stale, old even.  Knowing my love of hacking and messing around with things, I decided to jump ships to Android.

Lord, was I wrong.  I waited in line on Black Friday to buy the Samsung Galaxy S II, which by all accounts, was (and still pretty much is) the best Android device available.  ""It had a 4 inch screen!  It was really thin!  I could flash firmwares and new kernels!  Overclocking!  Oh, my,"" I thought!  Taking it home was an exciting feeling for me, a feeling I haven't felt since hearing the iPhone 4 being announced.  It was... wonderment.

Fast forward to today, where in the cold Winter light, I truly see what Android is as a platform.  What I once thought were positives are actually terrible negatives.  I loved flashing a new ROM for awhile, but then the truth slowly bubbled to the top; I was flashing ROMs to make my phone ""work.""  I would spend hours looking at differences in how each kernel's memory system worked, or if my MMS pictures wouldn't be converted to videos (yes, that's a real thing).  Overclocking isn't used to make your phone blisteringly fast, no, it's used to make your phone usable.  I have spent countless hours making my phone work the way it should have.

This leads me to my next issue, all of the ROMs and kernels couldn't fix the biggest issue; the fact that the most popular Android phone ever is still running a year old OS.  The source code for Ice Cream Sandwich was released on November 14, 2011.  If you do the math correctly, that's over three months ago.  What's worse is that custom ROMs can't even help; AT&amp;T is apparently holding on to the audio library's sources which means phone calls won't work in ICS.  No one knows when it will be released, though Samsung said it would at one point.  It's a slap in the face, honestly.  I invested the next *two fucking years* into a device that's future is up to whenever Samsung and AT&amp;T get around to it.

All of this piled on top of how disasterous the Android community is.  While the Apple fanboys of today are more docile, Android's fanboys are the rabid fanboys of yester-year.  Looking at any comment on Engadget immediately sickens me.  Going through pages of devs needlessly arguing over whose ROM is ""better"" is tiring and embarrassing.  Seeing countless users attacking iOS and saying ""they do it to us more"" is awe-inspiring.  (I'm not saying every Android user, developer, or fan is like this, but there's is definitely a vocal segment).

I made a mistake.  I want to come back.  I want a phone that can be as fast as possible, send picture messages, and run a current OS without me devoting hours to looking up memory pages.  I'm not saying I want a tinker toy OS, I'm saying that I want the baseline of my experience to be ""it's working"" and then let me go from there.

Here's to the iPhone 6 and hoping I can upgrade early!

iphone,"Youtube: ""This video is not available on mobile."" Any way around this on an iPhone?","I have a jailbroken iPhone 4S. Are there any tweaks or Apps to overcome this problem? 

Does anyone know WHY this occurs? Is it a flash player legacy or copyright stupidity or some other dumb reason? Mobile is the future!

I don't know how many times I have been on some social media service (eg twitter) and an artist links a video. I follow the link only to find it is not available on mobile.

Thanks ahead for any insight :-).

ipad,How best to use my iPad?,"I won a 16gb iPad2 yesterday in a raffle, and now I'm trying to figure out the best way to use it. If possible, I'd like to start leaving my old Macbook at home and just bring the iPad to school. I go to school in New York, and I tend to pack up all my crap for the day (food, five pound laptop, gym clothes, etc.) in the morning and carry it around with me all day. I was thinking about replacing this laptop relatively soon with a Macbook Air, since I'd like to cut down on the load I carry around most days, but I might be able to make do with this iPad.

I was thinking about getting a bluetooth keyboard so I can use it to take notes, write emails, do some writing for my thesis, etc. My only other real use for it would be web browsing (primarily RSS feeds, Reddit, etc.). Does anybody have thoughts on how useful the iPad is for these situations? Or should I use this device mainly for consuming media and light web browsing?

How good are bluetooth keyboards for typing? Can the iPad maintain its portability with one? Anybody have some thoughts on those keyboard/case combos? After doing a bit of research, I came across the Kensington Keyfolio Pro, the Belkin Keyboard Folio, and the Zaggfolio. 

Also, could somebody give some recommendations on regular cases/covers if I don't go the keyboard/case combo route? After doing a bit more research, I think I prefer the idea of getting the Logitech Tablet Keyboard or Apple Wireless Keyboard and pairing it with a case or a sleeve. Apple's Smart Cover looks nice, but I want something to protect the back. I was thinking about getting a nice leather one. I figure since I didn't have to pay anything for the device itself I could spend a little to take care of it.

I hope that wasn't too many questions and that this is in the right subreddit. This is my first time posting. I appreciate any advice.",29,23,2012-02-25,AAPL,0.026731234043836594,0.9288679361343384,0.0444008894264698
