iphone,"My dad just got scammed out of $500 due to an ""iphone virus.""","Hey /r/iphone 

My dad is computer illiterate and fell for the classic hijack threat. Apparently he was trying to access google and it wouldn't let him saying he had a virus and to call a certain number. He did and got on the phone with someone who would remove the virus for $100. They then asked if he had a desktop computer and it went downhill from there. After $500 he got rid of the virus and now has a shiny new subscription to Norton. He said the guy was persuasive and showed him the virus names on wikipedia and shit. 

I got very, very angry and called the number myself. I pretended to be a victim to see exactly what their operation was. It's a classic hijack and 'pay me for the antidote' extort. I was unaware these actually affected iPhones and unfortunately my dad who is a very smart man, he is way too trusting and not computer savvy and that's a dangerous combo. Just wanted to send this out as a warning because I am beyond livid, my dad is out $500 and these fuckstains are going to keep at it with success. 

Edit: They claimed to be with 'securemypc' and 'dial port solutions.' Dial port solutions is actually registered with the BBB so that's a great way to fool some unsuspecting victim. A quick google of their phone number 844-300-8828 brings up the real story with these crooks. Not trying to witch hunt, just wanting to spread awareness not to fall for this.

Second Edit: ""Dial Port Solutions"" is a BBB certified ""tech support"" company in Washington. I tried calling the number and it's just a number that puts you on hold. They currently have 4.4 rating and if you read the complaints ""fraudulent solutions to iPhone virus"" is right there at the top.

apple,The current music app has to be the worst music app ever.,"Before this new app was released, I would think ""how could this app possibly get any worse"". Then it did. It seems Apple is almost completely disregarding people who actually download music and replacing the app with internet radio. 

I have a lot of music, and I like to have a lot of music on my phone. I have the 128GB iPhone 6 Plus, and I fill it up with music until there's 20GB of free space. This app cannot handle large music collections.

The first issue I experienced was *severe* ""lagging"" while looking through my music collection with internet enabled for the app. It would select things I wasn't selecting, scroll to places I wasn't scrolling to, and switched me to the radio tab when I *definitely* was not doing that.

Another big problem is that it doesn't seem to know the [alphabet](http://imgur.com/a/g42av) very well.

And seriously...a drop down menu to switch between artists, albums, songs, and genres?

A very strange issue that I've come across is that if you play a specific song and then shuffle a selection of music that contains that song, *the same song will play* after one or two songs. This happens to me 100% of the time I do this.

There are no settings. It seems to choose for you whether it shows a list of albums or a list of songs sorted by album when you select an artist.

If they wanted to have a radio app, why not just make a damn radio app? Why nearly completely destroy the iPhone's use as a music storage device? People who use internet radio, which I guess is most people nowadays, would love a dedicated radio app, instead of trying to blend this strawberry, shit, and banana smoothie.

apple,Phil Schiller's Vision of Apple,"This is Phil Schiller's Grand Unified Theory of Apple 
http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/schiller-apple-theory/

As a rule, Philip Schiller told Medium’s Steven Levy, you should be using the smallest possible device to do as much work as possible, before going to the next largest gadget in line.

He then delivered what Levy described as Schiller’s “grand philosophical theory” of the Apple product line:

“The job of the watch is to do more and more things on your wrist so that you don’t need to pick up your phone as often.”

“The job of the phone is to do more and more things such that maybe you don’t need your iPad, and it should be always trying and striving to do that.”

“The job of the iPad should be to be so powerful and capable that you never need a notebook. Like, why do I need a notebook? I can add a keyboard! I can do all these things!””

“The job of the notebook is to make it so you never need a desktop, right? It’s been doing this for a decade.”

“[The job of the Mac] is to challenge what we think a computer can do, and do things that no computer has ever done before—[it should] be more and more powerful and capable so that we need a desktop because of its capabilities.”",190,675,2015-12-05,AAPL,0.029584743082523346,0.9314537048339844,0.03896154835820198

But... The slim top and bottom make it very easy to hold. It also means your jeans don't get a big bulge and stress at one particular point.

It adds weight, but the bulge goes in your palm so when picked up it doesn't feel bigger.

The headphone jack looks like it'll be an issue with right angled plugs.

All in all I'm very happy with it. It's absolutely a minimally intrusive as a battery case could be and the key thing for me is that it doesn't bulge or stress my jeans. It doesn't look or seem as big as any other battery case I've seen. I don't wear baggy jeans like some people might - I wear slim fitted ones so that might make a difference to some.

apple,iOS 9.2 and Apple Music: A Cautionary Tale,"I hope you all see this so that the same thing doesn't happen to you like it did to me.


Last night I downloaded iOS 9.2 onto my 6S. Everything went fine, no problems at all. I work a night shift, so at 7pm I put it to sleep, pocket it, and don't check it until my break at 1:30am. My phone has died. Skeptical, I plug it into my charger. After an hour it has only charged 40%. I can feel the phone heating up. I set up low-power mode and dive into the settings.


I made sure no apps were being refreshed in the background. I quit out of everything. Sure enough, it still drained, and I stopped it from dying by switching to Airplane Mode at 15%. Still confused, I resolved to figure it out after work.


I get in my car, and open the Music app after plugging into my stereo. Lo and behold, I see a bar at the top with some text saying, ""**Downloading 771 Songs**"". Holy shit. I had already downloaded my music via the ""make available offline"" feature, but installing iOS 9.2 must have changed that.



I go home, plug in, and get out of airplane mode and onto wi-fi. I get a text from my provider that **75% of the 12GB shared data plan for the month has been used**. Fuck. I don't connect to my work's wi-fi, so my phone tried to download all those songs over LTE.

The benefits are the simplicity of the service, the fact you can access it on the browser when needed and it doesn't do weird shit to your collection as Apple Music did with me (such as replacing live bootleg records with pristine studio versions of the songs!). The only disadvantage is there doesn't seem to be a way to get Google Music Play to download your entire collection to your device, you need to do it by playlist, album or artist.

iphone,"""brand new"" iPhone 6s","**EDIT** for people asking why I didn't buy it direct from apple, I bought it on contract. And for people not familiar with the carphonewarehouse, they are a big high street chain in the uk. 


Last night, I bought my girlfriend a (what I thought was) a brand new iPhone 6s from the carphonewarehouse (Uk). Everything seemed in order, box was sealed and after opening it, the phone had the screen protector etc on it. 

After we put a brand new sim in it (EE), and set it up, it turned out to have about 75 pictures belonging to some one else, some contacts and hundreds of call logs. 


We managed to find the previous owner on Facebook and messaged him on facebook, and he replied saying he had returned the phone a week ago. 


Now, obviously we were annoyed that we had bought a phone that was advertised as brand new, which clearly wasn't. We took it back and they reluctantly replaced it after arguing with them for half an hour. Absolutely awful service! The manager was saying it was impossible that it had happened and wasnt their fault. They insisted it would be investigated, but we still weren't happy with the service and tried making a complaint to head office to no avail!

apple,Improvements you’d like to see in the next version of OS X.,"I’ll start with the easy ones. 

Merge dashboard with the notification bar. Dashboard is all but obsolete, and the notification bar meagerly includes a handful of widgets. It’s time to go all the way. 

Merge launchpad and finder. Look, spotlight makes launchpad completely useless. There should be a launchpad-type view option built into finder that gives you that full screen graphical display, that incorporates the overflow/preview view for files, pictures and videos. Maybe the fullscreen view can be just that.

Notes. The ability to manually organize notes. I want the checklist to abide to your chosen font. The option to hide the date and second line in notes titles.

A unified messages / FaceTime app. I don’t really think there needs to be separate apps in this case, or that FaceTime really needs its own separate base. The FaceTime feature is already present in messages and contacts, so the lack of unification/simplification doesn’t really make much sense.

Thanks. Screenshot proof here: http://imgur.com/DzNthuy

***UPDATE 2***:  I have discovered 3 additional IP addresses that this data is leaking from. Kromtech has been notified and they are in the process of securing the data (again).

***UPDATE 3***:  Kromtech believes everything is now secure.

apple,Smart Case iPhone 6 review,"I told of a few of you I'd make a post about Apple's new smart case. So here it is. 

I have a bumper, the mophie Juice Pack Reserve, and the Smart Case. So, my review is going to compare it these products I've tried. 

First of all, the iPhone 6 is thin. Really thin. So thin, taking it out of any of the cases that I have almost feels awkward. Perhaps the reason is because I've used a bumper on my phone since the iPhone 4. For me the iPhone with a bumper just feels right. So I knew when I wanted a battery case I wanted the lightest possible option. At the time, the Mophie Juice Pack Reserve was the best option. It was the the thinnest battery case made at the time. 

I saw the pictures, and videos of it - but I truly didn't know what I got into. I hate every thing about it. The biggest problem is that your awesome thin iPhone is a gigantic brick. It feels horrible to hold, and feels heavy - heavy enough that it doesn't feel like an iPhone anymore. It's so hard to take the iPhone out that you end up keeping it in the case all the time. It feels like you're going to break it every time you take it out. It doesn't even give you a full 100% charge AND it requires a micro USB cable which means if you've got ton of lightning cables around but no micro USB lying around and can't find the cable it came with you're SOL. 

So I ordered the Smart Case. Which is $40 more than mophie's case. The first thing to notice is that it's very easy to put in and take out. Just seconds. With the mophie, I've struggled with over 5 minutes+ the first few times trying to take my phone out of the case. With the Smart Case, it's super easy. I love the fact that it's soft silicon, with a fabric lining. I can not stress how easy it was to install and take out compared to the mophie. It was a night &amp; day difference. 

Ok - that's fit &amp; finish. So how did it perform? I like how it immediately tells you how much charge your phone and your case has on the lock screen. It works differently than a normal case. With mophie's and others you are using it as a *backup* charger, but Apples design essentially is a portable wall outlet. 

There is no on/off switch - which threw me for a curve, at first. It automatically starts charging. With heavy use it will stay at 100% from 8 or 9 am to 2-3 pm. Then the iPhone battery does its work. With light use I've had the battery case stay at 100% from 8 am past 7 pm. You can take it off and charge it without tethering your fully charged phone or you can just keep it on. You wouldn't want to do this with the mophie because it simply would be too frustrating. 

It does add weight, but less than the mophie. Don't think that the weight is unnoticeable. It's noticeable. It's just better than the competition. The bump actually is better than the mophie style when you're talking on the phone. Your index finger rests right on top of the bump. Perfect for smaller hands too. Holding it from the bottom feels good too. 

I am very happy with the amount of charge it keeps which is more than the mophie. My only complaint is that it did not include a headphone extender. For those that are not familiar with any of these elongated cases, your head phone jack is too short. The case has a hole for it but it has increased the depth of the hole. Mophie included one with their case. Apple did not. It's kind of annoying to need one at all, IMO - but it's even more annoying to be on your way out, and try to listen to your headphones and not be able to because you have to go buy an adapter. That kinda kills to mood. 

The sound is better with the Apple Case too. Because the mophie case actually tries to change the direction of the speakers the sound feels like less bold - not tinny, but I don't know the word. I'd compare it to listening to music with high quality headphones (Apple) and cheapos that you can get in the dollar store (mophie). 

Other nit picky things : buttons. The mophie made the volume &amp; power buttons feels better - like better than it feels even when you have no case at all. You can tell they spent time making it feel like you didn't have to push those buttons with any extra force. Apple's case did not do this. It takes more effort than without the case. Mophie's case actually feels better than without a case at all. 

Overall I'd pick Apple's case. That's what I use everyday. Now the mophie just sits there being fully charged in the corner of my room. And it looks sad &amp; lonely.",239,206,2015-12-15,AAPL,0.04735122621059418,0.9182462096214294,0.034402571618556976

apple,"Does an ""open source"" collection of rules for Little Snitch exist? If not, should we create one?","Dear users of /r/apple,

Like many of you, I am a Little Snitch user. A couple of use case examples are the following:

* Preventing potentially dangerous connections when connected to an unknown network, except those required to connect to my VPN
* Prevent programs known to use excessive amounts of data from connecting when tethered or on a data-limited network connection

Little Snitch is very powerful for managing this kind of thing, but it's not always clear which processes should be allowed, which prevented, and under what circumstances.

I would love to know if there is some kind of ""open source"" collection of Little Snitch rules which well-informed people have created and maintain.

If such a collection does not exist, should we, as a subreddit, create one?

*Update 18.12.15*

Great to see such a positive response! One problem (which I probably should have thought about before) is that Little Snitch's backup format is binary, and thus is very difficult to revision control.

apple,Why don't notifications disappear from Notification Center when you open the app?,"For instance, Instagram will send me individual notifications whenever someone likes a photo. Let's say I post a photo and 10 people like it. I'll have 10 notifications. If I open the app and check out that picture, or even my in-app notification feed, nothing will clear from Notification Center. If I open it by tapping one of the notifications though, that one notification will clear but I'll be left with nine other notifications for the same picture.

Same goes for emails. I get two emails, tap the first, check the second while I'm in the app but the notification is still there. Or if I check the email on another device, the notification still persists.

I don't understand that. I'm still pretty new to iOS and I like it a lot more than Android overall, but I miss that on Android, if you checked an app, it would clear the relevant notifications automatically. It was totally seamless. On iOS, it's just needless steps to clear notifications after you've already checked them in the app.

apple,Unpopular Opinion regarding Foxconn suicides.,"TL;DR: Frankly, we should all give metals to Foxconn for how well they treat their employees. (yes, metal, like, especially aluminium, they need it to make iPhones).

Please let me explain before the down-votes. I only recently learned of this after working in China, and befriended a few lower-level (production line) employee of Foxconn.

I feel so bad for Foxconn for how unfair the news have treated it; people should know this, no matter how unpopular this realization might be.

First, what do I mean by Foxconn was treating its employees WELL? It's the same reason so many employees committed suicide in such short amount of time: After the first employee committed suicide in 2010, Foxconn was so committed to do the right thing, Foxconn promised to take care of the man's parents for life, they will never have to work again, and not only will Foxconn pay for all his sibling's education, but also promised to get them into respectable Universities.

This might be impossible to understand for westerners, but many employees thought this was a good deal and started jumping. One of the later jumpers sent a text message to his parents right before he jumped that read ""Jump once, family fed for life."" (This guy survived though)

To combat this, Foxconn HAD TO lower the benefit to jumpers' families in order to stop people from killing themselves. This was why 2010 was the worst year of suicides for at Foxconn when 14 people died. Suicide rate is much lower after and before Foxconn gave out such generous benefit to the families of those committed suicide.

Moreover, Foxconn employees between 1 - 1.5 million people depending on season and if you calculate those not officially employees by HR. Therefore, even at the most modest estimates, during the worst year, the suicide rate is around 1.5 / 100,000 (14 / 930,000) employees in 2010. This is 13 times less than China's national average of the same year. Comparing to suicide rate from other countries (per 100,000):

South Korea (38.4)

USA (20.2)

U.K. (18.2)

Denmark (17.3)

After Foxconn stopped providing excessive benefits to jumper's family, suicides at Foxconn greatly reduces, with only 1 case in 2010, and 2 cases in 2012.

Are some cases unreported, sure, but A. I don't think too many have been unreported since so many news agencies love this topic; B. there must be unreported cases from other countries' national average as well; and C. even if only 1 case of out 100 gets reported, the actual suicide rate is still lower than France. (In 2012 Foxconn had 2 reported suicides / &gt; 1,000,000 employee, or &lt; 0.2 / 100,000, France was 22.8 / 100,000)

Saying that working at Foxconn will make one happier than living in France would be absurd, but saying that one will be less likely to kill his/herself is just undeniable.

Edit: Working for Foxconn aren't slavery, their employees are much happier than average. It is just that our news only reports about Chinese suicides when it has something to do with our iPhones.

Edit 2: There are some comments stating that suicide rate at Foxconn might not be perfectly comparable to national averages due to inherently different rate on different age group and social class; I agree with this to some extent. However, I also doubt there is any social class or age group that has 100+ times lower suicide rate than the national average (see above example of France in 2012).",52,143,2015-12-18,AAPL,0.4826622009277344,0.49541905522346497,0.02191867306828499

apple,ThemeEngine for the rest of us,"For those who don't know, ThemeEngine (and ThemeEngine 2) is an app developed by the guy behind Zeppelin on iOS, and it's for theming OS X's UI, including the colors of windows and sidebars, etc.
  
  
I've given it a go, creating a custom (fully-dark) theme, but it's actually pretty meticulous- there are *a lot* of assets to theme. It'll take more time than I'm willing or able to put in, but for anyone who's interested, here's everything I know:
  
  
- Start by downloading Theme Engine 2 (for 10.11) from https://github.com/alexzielenski/ThemeEngine  
  
- **EDIT: You can download a pre-compiled .app ready to go from the Releases tab in GitHub.** You'll have to compile it in Xcode. It won't build, however, because you have to change the reference to ThemeKit. Remove the reference, and then add it with the + button, selecting the ThemeKit from the project. Resolve the signing issues (either with a self-signed certificate or an Apple Developer Program certificate, both obtainable with your Apple ID). Now it should build.  
  
- **Ignore this step if you downloaded the .app and don't need to compile!** It should run, but we don't want to run it from Xcode all the time, so stop the project and archive it (from the top menu bar, select Archive from ""Product""). Now there's probably a better way of doing this, but open Finder, click Command + Shift + C, go to the root of the OS X HDD/SSD, and search for ThemeEngine. The app icon should pop up in search results, so Command + C to copy it and Command + V to paste it into your Applications folder. You should be able to launch it from Applications now.  
  

- ThemeEngine is able to open the .car files that contain all the images that make up the OS X UI. That's right, they're all images! These .car files are located in **/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/** and you can get to them via Command + Shift + G in Finder (just paste in that path above). SystemAppearance.car is the default, and doesn't contain anything for the ""Dark Mode"" that Apple officially went with. It's the one we want to edit. Alternatively, you could edit the GraphiteAppearance.car and then you can switch between that and default via System Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearance, however GraphiteAppearance.car is incomplete, so you'd want to make a copy of SystemAppearance.car and rename it GraphiteAppearance.car, then you can go to town on it with all the assets, and not just the ones that are different between SystemAppearance and GraphiteAppearance. You'll also want to take a look at Assets.car. Note that if you want to ""activate"" Apple's incomplete Dark Mode, the full one, that's DarkAppearance.car, and you can rename it to GraphiteAppearance.car or SystemAppearance.car to see it in action. It's definitely a good place to start if your plans include a full Dark Mode.
- But before you go to town, back these up! Back up the entire folder to someplace safe. Also, before you can edit these files, change their names even, you have to disable rootless, which can be done via **csrutil enable** in Terminal from your OS X Recovery Partition (hold Command + R when you turn on your Mac). Rootless is a new feature in 10.11 that prevents you or anyone else from modifying OS X System files, but some (including myself) consider it a bit of overkill. OS X has been fine without it until now. Anyway...  
  
- It's good to have Photoshop or another professional image editor installed, because ThemeEngine comes with a neat feature. Select an asset, and then hit Command + Up Arrow to open that image in Photoshop. Make your changes, and then save it in Photoshop. Go back to ThemeEngine, click on that asset and Command + Down Arrow to replace it with the version you made in Photoshop. You can Command + Z to undo changes in ThemeEngine.  
  
  
- To see your changes, a reboot shouldn't be necessary. Simply open Terminal, type in **killall Finder** and relaunch the application you want to see for changes to take effect. Note: The application(s) must be Quit, not merely closed, most apps still ""run"" in the background if you simply click the red circle. Close apps from the Dock, the Dock indicator dot should go away.  
  
  
  
  

Happy theming!

apple,"After comparing Siri to the Google app, I feel like Apple isn't even trying.","When I switched from Android to iOS, I felt good about leaving Google behind. But after a few months on iOS, now I find myself gravitating more and more back to Google's ecosystems because Apple's leave a lot to be desired. Like Siri.

After getting in the habit on my Android phone of asking Google Now every question that came to mind, I realized pretty quickly that Siri just isn't up to the task and it's hugely disappointing. I finally caved and got the Google app again.

[Here's some random trivia questions I asked both services the other night.](http://imgur.com/a/ekN29)

It's no contest. Siri doesn't even try to find the answer; she just serves up a dumb Bing search and there ya go. Google is able to comb through a website, pull out the correct answer, and then read it back to me. And you can see in the Tom Cruise example that it even gives me a related search I could run to get additional info, and it serves up the same query about other actors that people commonly search for. 

Obviously that's Google's strength as a company, that's *what they do,* but that doesn't change my experience as a user at all. Apple is the most profitable company in the world and has the dominant smartphone platform (not in adoption but in money), yet when it comes to Siri, they're not even trying.",947,2115,2015-12-23,AAPL,0.032306741923093796,0.9230239987373352,0.044669315218925476

apple,A little tip if you see a picture that would make a good Watch background.,"Not sure if this has been written about before. I kind of had to wing it and figure it out. 

If you find a picture and think it would be a good Watch background, save the picture to your phone. Then crop it and make the aspect ratio 4:5. This is the same ratio as the Watch screen. Then you can move the picture and make room for the time and date. Move the pic to your photo album that syncs with the watch. 

Now go to the Watch and open Photos. Find your new pic and force press on it. Then create a new watch face. That's it! New custom Watch face exactly how you want it. 

When I finally figured this out I was churning out the watch faces. I've gotten rid of all the default faces except Simple and Modular. And I have 8 or 9 picture faces.

apple,"Search in Messages app doesn't find all the results, nor does it always take you to the right location of the keywords....","I've been having trouble finding texts in the Messages app for quite some time. I could be wrong, but I did some testing and found the strange behavior of the search function in Messages...

It seems to only look for words in most recent texts of each conversation/contact. Meaning, say, you have a list of 100 conversations in your Messages, and you click into each conversation, it'll only show the latest few texts. Each time you scroll to top, it'll try to load a few more previous texts. The ones you have to scroll up to load, the Messages app won't search for those. Whatever keywords you try to look for, if it's beyond the latest few texts inside each conversation, you won't find them in the results. 

It's pretty annoying. I don't know if it's a bug or something. And is it just mine that does this? I've just done several more tests and it seemed to be the case.  

Besides, I thought since the recent few updates, the Messages app has been able to take you to the exact position of the keyword you look for. But it doesn't seem to always do that now. I frequently end up in the bottom of the conversation, when the keywords is buried one page up...

Anyone else experiencing this?

**EDIT**: the above is about iOS. Just went and tried it on OSX, the OSX's messages app does search for *all* the past texts, but the problem is, if you have multiple matches within *one* conversation, it'll only show you the latest one, there seems to be absolutely no way to jump to previous matches. Same goes for iOS. So, if you have to find one that's first of the 30 matches inside a conversation, you'll feel the real pain... What. The. Hell.

apple,Is feature creep becoming an issue in iOS? (Long discussion on the state of Apple's UI/UX),"With the introduction of 3D Touch Quick Actions, I've been thinking about some of the features Apple has been adding in recent years and I'm beginning to feel like the overall interaction model is starting to lose clarity. Because of feature creep, the experience is starting to get a little muddied by an excess of different features that are found in different locations and on different screens, which leads to both confusion and redundancy.

When using an iOS device, there are 3 main things you want to do:

1. **Quickly access relevant information** (maps, weather, sports scores, financial info, health data, time/date, appointments, etc…)

2. **Accomplish tasks quickly while you're on the go** (send messages, use social networks, take pictures, set reminders and alarms,  play media, etc…)

3. **Go into the full app for a more comprehensive experience,** where you have more features and can accomplish more. This also includes entertainment, like gaming.

That essentially summarizes what a user wants to do with his or her mobile devices. You want quick information, you want to accomplish quick, easy tasks, and you want a more feature-rich experience for when you're not as constrained for time and not as busy.

The thing is that with the addition of multiple new features and UI elements over the last few years, there are many different ways to accomplish these 3 tasks. We have:

* Today View

* Proactive screen

* Spotlight search

* 3D Touch Quick Actions

* various shortcuts like Quick Reply, Lock Screen shortcuts etc...

* full iOS apps

* Apple Watch Complications

* Apple Watch Glances

* Apple Watch apps

**So my question is, what's the interaction model? What’s the general use case? How do you go about your day?**
For example, to quickly glean information, there are at least 7 different places to look - on your phone, you have the Today View, Proactive Screen, Lock Screen, and Siri, and then on your Apple Watch, you have Complications, Glances, and Siri. That’s 7 separate interaction methods. To accomplish tasks quickly, there's your Apple Watch, there's 3D Touch Quick Actions, there are various OS shortcuts, there’s Siri, and so on. That’s at least 4 interaction models. And of course, there are full apps for the full mobile feature set.

**It just seems to me like there are a lot of different places to look, and there's a lot of redundancy between these features.** For example, take the Apple Watch. One of the device’s primary reasons for existing is to serve as a quick and easy way to accomplish simple tasks. Rather than having to spend the time and effort to delve into intricate iOS apps and find the feature you’re looking for, the Apple Watch exists to have these sort of mini-apps on your wrist. Instead of jumping into the full feature set on your phone, you have this streamlined device where the apps have been deliberately stripped of their features and simplified so that you can very easily access a few key features that you need.

**Well, isn’t that exactly what the 3D Touch Quick Actions do?** They exist to allow the user to forgo the need to jump into the full app. You 3D Touch the app icon and you’re given a short list of key options to get a few choice functions done on the go, when you don’t want to use the full app. In other words, this key feature of the Apple Watch and one of the main reasons for the product’s existence – is the same reason why 3D Touch Quick Actions were created.

**The same is true for the Proactive screen and the Today view.** The Today view was added to the Notification Center to give you a quick glance at some temporally relevant information to help you go about your day. Well, isn’t that exactly what the Proactive screen does? So why are these two separate UI elements? Why haven’t they been combined into one singular UI in one place?

**Another example of this redundancy is Apple Watch’s app screen. Why does it exist?** Even if watchOS 3, 4, and 5 vastly improve the speed and quality of the apps, I don’t really see the purpose of having these apps on your wrist. If you want to glean quick information, you use the Complications and Glances. If you want more than that, your phone provides a much better experience. **The app screen on the Apple Watch seems to sit in this no man’s land of functionality, where it’s redundant and doesn’t serve a purpose that can’t be better served on your phone.**

This issue even seems to pop up with the iOS keyboard. There are at least 3 separate places for text correction – the three predictive boxes above the keyboard, the white bubble that pops up, where you can hit the ‘x’ to cancel an autocorrect, and also the black bubble that pops up, where you can tap the replacement word. Similarly, with the introduction of 3D Touch, there are now two ways to go about moving your cursor and selecting text. You can select by touching the text directly, or you can 3D Touch the keyboard. As much as I love moving the cursor via 3D Touch, I’ve been finding lately that jumping back and forth between the keyboard and the text itself can be rather confusing.

**There are a lot of examples of this type of redundancy in the feature list I posted above. Most of these features are great. Individually, they’re thoughtfully designed, well-implemented, and visually appealing. But taken together, they step on each other’s toes. There’s no unified approach to how you use the device. There are a lot of cool functions, features, and UI elements, but there’s no holistic approach to the interaction model of the ecosystem.**

One might argue that that creates choice in how you do things, but I’d argue that it creates confusion and messiness. It’s a bunch of disparate but cool features instead of a unified user experience. And as more features get added each year, I can only see this feature creep issue getting worse. Right now, it’s still manageable, but by iOS 10 or 11, I could see some real user confusion coming about. We’re already seeing examples of that with the Spotlight search coming from 2 different places in the UI.

Because of all of that, I feel that Apple needs to put more emphasis on the totality of the experience. It needs a more top down approach. Apple’s hardware, software, technologies, and ideas are better than ever, but where the company is starting to show signs of cracks is in creating a holistic and clear-cut user experience.

I’m hoping that Apple’s designers find a way to correct this before feature creep becomes too much of a problem in the next couple years. This is an extremely difficult problem to solve, (since you have to find the right balance between consolidating features without confusing users who use them), but I’m confident that Jony Ive, Alan Dye, and their teams can find a way to do it.


**Thoughts? Agree? Disagree?**

**(I realize that this is a super long post, but hopefully others with an interest in UI/UX will read it and share their thoughts on the matter. And of course, if you agree with anything I've said, don't hesitate to make your opinion known and provide [feedback](http://www.apple.com/feedback/) to Apple.)**

**tl;dr -** Apple's ideas and technologies are better than ever, but where the company is starting to suffer is in putting them all together in a cohesive manner. Contrary to what some people say, there is no shortage of incredible innovation at Apple today. But many of these innovative ideas are starting to feel like disparate ideas that don't fit together as pieces of a larger puzzle. Because of that, I'm hoping that iOS 10, along with watchOS, tvOS, and OS X, places a big focus on eliminating the seams, reducing redundancy, and creating greater cohesion in the UI/UX.",182,731,2015-12-26,AAPL,0.05016780458390713,0.9194097220897675,0.030422494746744633

apple,Why did Apple design OS X's split screen exiting to leave a window in Full Screen mode?,"I like the addition of the split screen functionality to OS X, but I find that how exiting that mode works to be quite poorly designed.

For example, if I have two windows, neither of which are in Full Screen mode, and I set them up to be in Split Screen mode, when exiting out of this mode by clicking the green window button, I would expect the windows to go back to their original setup. Instead, one window (the one not clicked) enters Full Screen mode and the other reverts back to its position prior to entering Split Screen mode.

Mission Control offers a way to restore both windows to their original position (by clicking the double-arrow/contract button on the split screen group's icon in the upper bar), but to me, this should be the default behavior of clicking the green button.

If anyone is less OS-X-savy and unaware of multiple desktops or full screen windows (I'm picturing a newer user to OS X), this full-screened window would be hidden to them. 

Can anyone comment on why the current design is better than my proposed behavior of the green button?

apple,I really wish iOS 10 and OSX 11 move to a biennial release cycle and use the extra time for optimization.,"It's evident that iOS 9.2 and OSX 10.11.2 have finally fixed many long-time bugs, optimizing the operating systems to a rather satisfactory state that we had been hoping for in the past couple of years, even though there is still plenty waiting to be resolved. 

Notorious issues like difficulty to enable instant hotspot, noticeable drop of frame rate in UI animations, etc.. have now been near-perfected in these latest versions, which makes me feel that it might be a better approach to release a major version every two years, starting from OSX10.12 and iOS10, leaving the following year, 2017, to be the extra time for optimization.  (edit: I originally wrote OSX11, I actually meant 10.12, or whatever the next number will be)

I believe that the current demand for better-calibrated software is higher than that of additional features. This extended period of time will allow apple to really fine tune its software. We've been seeing apple cramming new features into both of its own operating systems in the past couple years, which wasn't a bad thing at all. The big issue, however, was that the company seemed to have been struggling to polish all these newly added functions, while many old time glitches still lingered. 

I can't help but feel the need for apple to, not slow down, but change its way of approaching these new releases. I still remember the earlier day of iOS when the entire system was smooth and fluid as things were lightweight and simple. Indeed the demand for features will never cease to grow, and yet it's seemingly come to a point where the weight of building a feature-filled full-blown system has become rather overwhelming, even for apple. 

Changing its pace wouldn't be a step backward. Insisting on version-jumping can be pointless if the new major version is only for cleaning the mess the previous one has somehow created. I really rather that iOS 10, as well as OSX 10.12, take two years to fine tune, than to jump into the next version number just a year later, calling it a new major update, while it's in fact only for optimizing under the hood for the most part. If many older issues aren't resolved, having iOS 10 going up to a .8 or even a .10 version wouldn't be a bad thing. And new features *can* still be added in these minor updates. I would rather that the major version numbers are used when apple is absolutely ready, than rushed into just because they have to still keep up with the annual release deadline even when these OSes are no longer lightweight and simple as once before.",156,292,2015-12-30,AAPL,0.08688033372163773,0.8830162286758423,0.030103527009487152
