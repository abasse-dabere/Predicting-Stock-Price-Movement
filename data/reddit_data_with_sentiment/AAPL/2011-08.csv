apple,Highly unscientific comparison of Thunderbolt Promise RAID enclosure to a 2nd Gen Drobo,"I ponied up the money for a 6TB Promise R6 Thunderbolt enclosure recently to replace my aging 2nd gen Drobo 4 drive FW800 enclosure. I thought /r/apple might like to see how it works.

The Promise enclosure shipped with 6 1TB drives (Hitachi HDS72101). These were then setup with 1 drive as a hot spare, and the remaining 5 placed in a RAID 5 array, for 4TB of usable space.

The Drobo enclosure shipped without drives, I loaded it with 4 1.5TB drives. (Seagate ST31500341AS).  This amounts to 4.07TB of usable space. The Drobo makes you choose a partition size, then divides the unit into as many virtual partitions as it takes to completely consume this ""real"" usable space. In my case I went with a 4TB partition. The Drobo created 2 partition, because there was an additional .07TB available. This can be really dangerous as there are numerous reports on the Drobo support forums of people filling their arrays to capacity and being unable to upgrade them after that. I marked the second volume as ""DO NOT USE"" to ensure I always had a little bit of space left on the device.

All tests were run on a 2011 Mac Mini dual-core i7 @ 2.7Ghz. I tried to quiet the background tasks as much as possible, but I had to log in using SSH and I had a Screen Sharing session open at the same time. Spotlight was told to ignore all the drives in the system so it wouldn't run during the test.

**Read speed**

For this test I used a (roughly) 3GB file placed at the root of each volume. Here's the actual size:

    $ ls -alF /Volumes/Promise/test.iso 
    -rwx------  1 sfrazer  staff  3224686592 Aug  1 22:26 /Volumes/Promise/test.iso*
    $ ls -alF /Volumes/Drobo/test.iso 
    -rwx------  1 sfrazer  staff  3224686592 Aug  1 21:52 /Volumes/Drobo/test.iso*

Then I simply copied the file to /dev/null and timed the results:

    $ time cp /Volumes/Promise/test.iso /dev/null 
    real	0m8.083s
    user	0m0.004s
    sys	0m1.266s
    
    $ time cp /Volumes/Drobo/test.iso /dev/null
    real	3m17.916s
    user	0m0.004s
    sys	0m1.015s

**Write speed**

For this test I used dd to create a 3GB file pulled from the contents of /dev/zero and timed it.

    $ time dd if=/dev/zero of=/Volumes/Promise/test.out bs=1024k count=3072 
    3072+0 records in
    3072+0 records out
    3221225472 bytes transferred in 6.302505 secs (511102405 bytes/sec)
    
    real	0m6.516s
    user	0m0.009s
    sys	0m2.097s
    
    $ time dd if=/dev/zero of=/Volumes/Drobo/test.out bs=1024k count=3072 
    3072+0 records in
    3072+0 records out
    3221225472 bytes transferred in 202.931352 secs (15873474 bytes/sec)
    
    real	3m23.066s
    user	0m0.007s
    sys	0m2.174s

That's about 3.0 Gbps on the read speed and about 3.8Gbps on the write speed on the Promise RAID controller.
That's compared to roughly 121 Mbps read speed and about 124 Mbps write speed on the Drobo.",14,22,2011-08-02,AAPL,0.05147244781255722,0.9036352932453156,0.04489224776625633

apple,My Safari Extension Developer experience...,"Preface: Mostly I'm posting this because I'm curious if any other extension developers have run into similar issues to me.  Sorry, it's not a positive post about Apple.

So, I write [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com), and added Safari support a while back.  Unfortunately, one of my computers croaked and I needed to replace it.  Turns out, this has put a major damper on my ability to develop RES for Safari.

I can't find the original information used to generate my ""Safari Developer Certificate"" - a necessary step in deploying an extension.

I'm using Windows 7, by the way.  Sorry in advance.

I can download and install the certificate again, but Safari won't recognize it.  It looks like I need to recreate the CSR (certificate signing request) used to request the certificate in the first place.  Admittedly my knowledge of this stuff is ""only a little better than average"", but Apple's documentation of it is even worse.

Well, I figure, if I can't get this working and my google-fu isn't helping me solve the problem, I'll just generate a new certificate and start over.  Problem is: I can't.  The ""Add Certificate"" button on the site does nothing when clicked.  It's nonfunctional.

I contacted support to try and figure out why the button wouldn't work.  5 days later, I got an automated response linking me to 2 different FAQ pages that were totally unrelated to my question.

I replied, saying basically (I'm paraphrasing here) ""I understand your team is likely overwhelmed with responses, but this email seems automated despite coming 5 days after my request, and doesn't address my issue at all - I'm on the page you're telling me to go to create a certificate on, and the Add Certificate button doesn't work""

Later that day: a less automated-looking response that still ignores any mention of the Add Certificate button.  It links me to a couple of forum threads where people are having trouble *installing* certificates.

I respond, a little annoyed this time, explaining that this doesn't address my question either.

I get a response asking me to detail, in step by step fashion, how to replicate the issue.  I send them instructions (log into site, click this, click that, get to certificate page, click add certificate - nothing happens)...

I get another response, a day later, as follows:

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for contacting Apple Developer Support regarding the Safari Developer Program.

Wow. Seriously?  This is just disgusting.  I've never received such absurdly useless and stupid support as a developer.

Comparisons:

- The team at Opera got a guy to contact me directly and help me to learn the Opera extensions architecture (yes, they're obviously in a different position than bigger browser makers)

- The team at Firefox have an IRC channel where people have provided me LOTS of help

- Chrome's extension architecture documentation has been good enough that I haven't needed their support.

- Apple's documentation, I swear, has been the worst of the bunch... and their support is actually *worse* to me than nonexistent, because I've wasted several days spinning my wheels hoping for an authoritative answer when I may as well have been continuing on my fruitless google-fu quest...

apple,My Awesome Apple Store Story!,"Ok!

So at the end of 2007 I bought myself a 15"" Macbook Pro.

It was a great computer and then a few months ago the screen just wouldn't turn on.

The computer booted fine and I was apple to put it in target disk mode, the only problem (or so I thought) was the screen not turning on.

I googled and googled and it seemed like heaps of people with the 07 MBP were having the same issue. I found out that NVIDIA had a bad batch of graphics cards and my mac fell into that batch.

I also read Apple had extended the waranty to 4 years (with or without apple care) for these macs.

So finally around a month ago I made a genius appointment and took my mac down.

They ran a diagnostic test and confirmed that it was indeed the graphics card and that they would fix it at no cost. They repair involved replacing the entire logic board as the graphics card is soldered to it.

So a few days later I got a call saying that they had replaced the logic board but they found a cable that was faulty so they were waiting for that part to come in.

Then a few days later that rang and said that my computer had been repaired but was still failing some tests so they had to investigate why.

Finally a couple of days later I get a call saying that they have put around $4000 dollars worth of parts and labor into my computer and it just wasn't working.

So they then offered to replace my 4 YEAR OLD 15"" MBP with a brand new 2011 15"" Macbook Pro. I was dumbfounded and so excited. The only provision was that I buy apple care with it which I had no problem with at all.

It gets better...

I asked if it would be possible to upgrade to the 17"" model and pay the difference. It was all good and so it was going to cost me 400 for apple care plus 800 for the 17"" upgrade. $1200 for a brand new 17"" MBP with apple care. Not bad.

A few days passed and I hadn't heard from them so i called and they said Apple Care were taking ages to approve the replacement and that they would get back to me shortly.

Again another couple of days passed and I got another called saying that they were still waiting for apple care and that because I had waited so long they were going to waive the $800 upgrade fee so all I had to pay was $400 for the apple care.

I picked up my brand new 17"" MBP today along with apple care and a neo-preen sleeve.

$499.95 for all that.

Gotta be happy with that.

TL;DR Apple replaced my 4 year old 15"" mbp with a brand new 2011 17"" MBP for free.",191,233,2011-08-05,AAPL,0.11524415016174316,0.8360573053359985,0.04869849234819412

iphone,I have found the Holy Grail [0],"Okay so I, as I'm sure many of you, use AlienBlue on my iPhone to browse reddit

And I've always had the constant problem of zooming into photos correctly. Sure, I can use two fingers to pinch-zoom and I can two-finger double-tap to get a full zoom.

**But really, who browses reddit other than with one finger: Their thumb**

Anyway, so I was sitting on the toilet when I discovered this:

If you have an image you want to zoom into fully...

1. Double-tap in the blank space not occupied by the image (it should highlight it)

2. Double tap on the image itself (where you want the zoom to be centered)

3. YOU JUST FUCKING DID IT!

I hope this opened your world as it did mine



**EDIT:**

Some of you are confused, so maybe I'm explaining this wrong. It probably works best with an example...

apple,My [positive] Apple Story,"Two years ago, I bought a 13in MacBook Pro for my mom. We are living in South Korea, and here there are a lot of fake Apple stores that seem 100% legit. Well, while I was at college (November 2010), the S.M.A.R.T sensor on her hard drive failed and said that her hard drive needed to be replaced. She took it to a local place, which said they were ""Certified"" but were not. Sadly though, she didn't know this.

At the store, they ""replaced"" her hard drive, charged her $200, and said that the sensor wasn't really bad, but it was an error that couldn't be fixed. She thought it was fishy, but didn't do anything about it. 

I come home for the summer, and she is telling me about this. I do some research and find that the sensor is **IN** the hard drive, and to replace the hard drive, the sensor would be replaced too.. Needless to say, they charged her $200 to do *_nothing_*.

So, I called Apple that day. Tom, the Apple guy I talked to in Australia, (who, by the way, was extremely nice and helpful) said that there was no mention of a hard drive repair for my mom's MBP case log (cases are how apple logs all their repairs and stuff). Tom, the Apple representative said that if we can submit the receipt for the place (which is now gone [moved location/shutdown]), and take her MBP to an ACTUAL Apple store, they would replace it for her.

I just got it back today, and not only did they replace the hard drive, but they put a 500Gb in free of charge, instead of the 250Gb that was in there.

Apple customer care is amazing. Props to them.

ipad,Anyone else want a bigger iPad?,"I've seen comments by some people that they want a smaller ipad, and I've been puzzled because I want the exact opposite!  I may be off base here, but while I like the ipad2, I've been thinking that it shouldn't be too much of a stretch for apple to make an ipad that has screen size of a regular 8 1/2 x 11 inch piece of paper.   Along with Wacom tablet capabilities, it would be the answer to all my prayers for a real consumer computing device that would replace my laptop, and possibly become my sole computing device.   

Not only could you consume all the media, etc.  But it would be a big enough screen to do what 95% of people do with computers, including creating content.  While there will always be a need by devs, admins, and other CPU/GPU intensive professions for more power, they would form a very small minority of the populace.   

Right now, though I like the Ipad, I still need my laptop for the bigger screen to read my pdf's, for the real estate to see enough things on my screen, etc.  A larger ipad would solve all these problems.

Will it be less portable and heavier?  Sure.  It has to be.  But I think the trade would be worth it, and given the increase in size, you might have a change in the behavior of how it's used to compensate in any case.

Since the odds seem to be in my favor, I have decided to raise the stakes of the game a bit. I, the independent creator of Tap Maze, will send $150 via PayPal to the first person to complete the game. 

Think you've got the skills? 

To be eligible you must log your scores on the Global Leaderboard. Send me an email at Clay[at]ClayKohut[dot]com containing screenshots of the win screen and your winning score on the Leaderboard, and I'll send you $150.

Tap Maze is free and seemingly-simple. Maybe you'll succeed where others have failed. Good luck.

**Game Description:**


Tap Maze is a simple-yet-challenging game that tests players' reasoning and reaction times. Ideal for both short bursts of fun as well as longer play sessions, Tap Maze is incredibly addictive and surprisingly difficult.

CzarCastic, a TouchArcade member, spent a total of 5 and a half hours playing the game today before finally making his successful run.  CzarCastic is truly a Tap Maze champion and a god among gamers.

Czar has been paid and made around $30/hour playing Tap maze today.  [Check out the TouchArcade thread for more.](http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=103304&amp;page=3)

I was hoping the contest would run longer, but it was still a ton of fun.

Thanks a lot for playing, everyone. A review on the app store or just a good word to your friends would mean a ton for me.

apple,Are MacBooks really overpriced?,"Windows user here. I was/am looking for the new laptop with good monitor (for photo editing purpose) comparable to what apple macbooks can do (looking for 13-15'' and about 1050 lines of resolution for 15'') and I can't find anything non-Apple for the same price. It is either much cheaper with bad monitors, or those with good monitors and similar other specs (like SSD drive) are more expensive than Macbooks (air or pro, depending on screen size).

I kind of start questioning the whole ""Apple is overpriced piss of shit"" mantra. Or am I looking in the wrong places for laptops with good monitors?

(The reason I am posting this to Apple subreddit is because I want people to reply who actually knows about apple laptops. And while most of the Apple users do know and use PCs, most windows users do not use Apple, but have opinion about Apple as something very overpriced, so they unlikely to give any reasonable answer except for pissing contest. I know, I was one of them until this search for better laptop.)

EDIT1: Please consider in your replies the fact that my primary concern is MONITOR with good color reproduction and resolution for photo-editing tasks. It is very easy to find Windows laptop with other superior specs and cheaper, but their monitors are quite bad in comparison.

**EDIT 3** Due to character limitations, I can no longer add anymore apps. I dwindled it down to the best apps I could. Removed descriptions of Apple/Simple apps.

*Text Editing/Note-Taking*

* **$0.00** [PlainText](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plaintext-dropbox-text-editing/id391254385?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [SpringPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/springpad/id360116898?mt=8#) Always forgetting stuff? Need to take a picture to remember for later? Don't have time to dictate what your teacher says? SpringPad is a quick, efficient version of EverNote. SpringPad does all the things you expect from EverNote, so both are a good choice if you need to quickly jot down that homework assignment.

* **$1.99** [Penultimate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8) A step up from your standard note-taking apps, this one is cool to use with a stylus. Classes like Biology and Anatomy, as well as several graphically inclined classes will love this app, since all the pages allow you to draw and write on them. You can also use different kinds of pages, like college ruled and graph paper. The app comes with separate notebooks, so you can keep track of different classes with different notes.

* **$4.99** [NoteTaker HD](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/note-taker-hd/id366572045?mt=8) Import what you need, and export what you made with this high quality note app. You can zoom to write, and insert your own images, and best yet, you can display notes on a TV or projector.

* **$4.99** [SoundNote](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soundnote/id364789577?mt=8#) Redditor-created, this app combines the two valuable things you need in class: a lecture recorder, and a full note editor. Designed at the core to let you draw, type, and record a lecture all at once, in case you fall asleep, missed a bullet point, or just felt like doodling the whole class.

* **$4.99** [UPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/upad/id401643317?mt=8#) Probably the best bang for your buck. This app takes full control of any note takers dreams. Cornell Notes, drawing, typing, writing, outlining, everything. Simple, and it comes with a great UI, available for cloud syncing as well as TV output! This really pushes competition for any note-taking app.

*Schedule/Course Load*

* **$0.00** [BlackBoard](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackboard-mobile-learn/id364252826?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [Wunderlist](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderlist/id406644151?mt=8)

* **$0.00** *$0.99 Ad-Free* [inClass](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inclass/id374986430?mt=8) Excellent organizer app. This has a combination of great app features in one place, and is my main study hub. The organizer can keep track and remind you of exams for classes, and can let you know of homework due. The notes portion is also a cool feature because it automatically knows what class you are taking and drops the notes you take in that class (based on what time you put your classes, it knows when that time is). A side note, you can also record full lectures while taking notes!

* **$2.99** [iStudiez Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/istudiez-pro/id310636441?mt=8) Definitely considered for the power user in mind. A rival to inClass, this app is for the multi-device/""I left my iPad at work"" user, because of it's multi-sync ability, and a dropbox enabled usages, you don't have to worry about needing your iPad everyday at class. All the same features from inClass can be found in this pretty app, as well.

* **$0.00** *$0.99 Ad-Free* [Grades 2](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grades-2/id427900301?mt=8) Can you stand to make less than a B on your final to pass that History class? What if you fail the mid-term for Chem? Or maybe you didn't turn in that homework assignment for Spanish? If you spend more time worrying what you don't NEED to do, grab this free app to keep in check with your grades. Grades 2 can predict how well you will do in class, even if your teacher can't. As a bonus, you can get notifications on upcoming tests and assignments!

* **$0.00** *Textbook purchase* [Kno](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textbooks/id424280183?mt=8#) It's free, but it'll still cost you anywhere between $60 to $200 dollars for textbooks. This app is like an advanced iBooks for your textbooks, allowing you to annotate, study, and even quiz directly from the book you are using. The system is a bit short on books (only 100,000 some odd books, so you may not find all of your books), but the books it does have are extremely current. If you really want to drop the books altogether, this app is for you. (Mind you, grants will NOT pay for these books.)

*Paperwork/Storage*

* **$0.00** [iBooks](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8)

* **$4.99** [GoodReader](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreader-for-ipad/id363448914?mt=8#) A step up from iBooks, this PDF/file editor lets you go beyond reading, by allowing DropBox sync, highlights, linkable pages (like a table of contents!) and even ANNOTATIONS. The most important function of any PDF viewer. If you annotate your teacher's pages like crazy, this one's up for consideration.

* **$9.99** [iAnnotate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953?mt=8#) Stepping up further is iAnnotate, when you've got a huge list of PDFs to sort/annotate, you'll want to pay the extra $5, since you'll get a global power seach through ALL of your files, as well as a huge assortment of annotation tools (this is an ANNOTATION app, right?). Pick this up if you've got to take notes on that 85 page document your teacher assigned to read over the weekend.

* **$9.99** [Pages](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [DropBox](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8) Another useful app to keep yourself organized between school and home. Use it to create a separate doc folder to quickly keep files and docs between your iPad and your Desktop. Forgot that paper at home? Not if it's in your DropBox folder!

*Tools/Accessories*

* **$0.00** [TouchCalc](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchcalc/id286091993?mt=8)

* **$0.99** [HiCalc HD](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hicalc-hd-pro/id442665708?mt=8) Includes all the calculators!

* **$14.99** [Papers](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/papers/id304655618?mt=8) Research any subject easily, even store articles to reference to.

* **$0.00** [Noterize](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noterize/id364906681?mt=8#) I put this down here because you can get a 15% discount on the PogoSketch (see below). This app is a free, full powered PDF editor/notation. For the price of free and a 15% discount, this is a must get for you annotators. Freehand highligh/sticky note all your PDFs and even directly download them from the built-in browser!

* **$14.95** [PogoSketch](http://tenonedesign.com/sketch.php)

* **$9.99** [Keynote](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480?mt=8)

Those are my essential apps. Leave a comment about any other apps you feel best for school, and I'll keep the post up to date for other student-redditors. Also, if you've got any tips/tricks to staying organized, leave them here, too!",81,67,2011-08-11,AAPL,0.05472906865179539,0.91854128241539,0.02672963123768568

EDIT: Perhaps I should clarify: I am a Canadian I do a lot of traveling, as I work and travel between Canada and developing countries often. I need a phone to use for calling and texting in these countries. Previously I have used a shitty international phone.

apple,"My Macbook died so I bought a Macbook Airâ€¦ after almost a month's use, I only miss one thing - a larger HD.","So, not up to a month ago, my 13"" Macbook kind of died and was out of warranty, with no apple care to go with it. I took it to the Apple Store and they said it would cost me about Â£150 to get it fixedâ€¦ quite cheap really, and I'll probably get it fixed before the end of the year, but I *needed* an excuse to buy a Macbook Air, and there it was. 

At first I was worried that no ethernet port and only 128GB for the 13"" model (cheaper one) was not enough for work, but once I took it home and started playing I was sold. 

Before buying, I had some fears, so if anyone has the same, here's my take on them and my first impressions: 

* **No Ethernet**: At work, the fact that I could only connect via wifi put me off at first, ""no gigabit ethernet? oh dearâ€¦"" I thought. Well, wifi seems to be doing very well, thank you. It's a pity that when my home wifi breaks down, I can't connect via ethernet and troubleshoot it, but so far turning the router on and off has been enough. For the rest, speed is not really an issue. And you can always get the USB adapter if you *really* need ethernet.

* **Small HD**: This is still a problem for me. In fact, it's the *only* thing I miss. Can't wait for large SSD's to appear in the market, if they ever do in my lifetime heh. The speed is amazing, I didn't expect so much difference. I'm really sold. I've had to buy a network HD (which is also slow to upload to, since I don't have ethernet) where I save all my videos and iMovie projects. I hope I can upgrade to a thunderbolt capable one soon.

* **No optical drive**: Sometimes you need it. Not me. My cousin uses my laptop sometimes and wanted to record music on a CD for her dance classes. She couldn't. No other problems whatsoever, though. I mean, who can't connect an mp3 player to some speakers nowadays?

Anyway, if you're thinking about buying an air but can't decide, my opinion is: **buy**.",103,47,2011-08-19,AAPL,0.028566887602210045,0.9269514083862305,0.044481679797172546

iphone,"In all likelihood, an irreproducible iPhone bug","I was playing around with my iPhone, try to get it to balance between home screens (I've been able to do it several times before http://i.imgur.com/XM0ze.jpg ). As I was trying to do this I inadvertently held down on an app icon for too long, which of course makes them wiggle. Somehow I deleted an app's icon, without actually deleting the app (it was still available in the app switching tray) - it happened too quickly to really know what happened. As a result, I was left with a blank spot on that homescreen. I couldn't grab the blank spot to move it, but if I moved the other apps around, it would move as if it were actually there. So, I restarted my phone. Upon restarting my phone, it was restored to the default first home screen, and all my other apps were taken out of folders and arranged alphabetically throughout the remaining home screens. So weird...

apple,Is Game Center harmful to the health of game developers?,"Game Center has a limit of 25 leaderboards per game. Moreover, once a leaderboard goes live, you can't remove or reset it.

Why does this matter?

High scores demand perfection on the part of the game developer both in game design and implementation. 

It is generally impossible to get the gameplay ""right"" in terms of game design. Generally one can try to improve gameplay over time. However, this makes scores incomparable in the leaderboard. 

Moreover, it is generally impossible to get the gameplay bug-free. One can try to fix bugs over time but again you get the problem with incomparable scores in the leaderboard.

Leaderboards that should not or cannot be reset for whatever reason(s) prevent the game developer from improving the gameplay and fixing bugs.

You could create a new leaderboard in Game Center when you have incomparable scores, but as mentioned above, there is a limit of 25 leaderboards per game.

This whole situation can be very stressful to the game developer -- particularly an independent game developer who does everything himself/herself and encounters limitations on leaderboard resets that are out of his/her control.

I have another account with no password that doesn't have administrative privileges just in case someone were to steal it. My theory is the thief would use the standard account while the prey project app is submitting logs to my email along with pictures. But it seems like there is a bug in prey on 10.7 that doesn't allow pictures to be sent. I was wondering if there were any alternatives to prey. Also I'm wondering if there is a VNC app that allows you to log on from another mac or pc, without having my air having to confirm access to screen sharing, file sharing etc..

iphone,iPhone 4 is a drug.,"It's been.. three days. Three. Days. Three horrible iphoneless days. Mine got stolen from me THE ONE TIME I let my guard down. How could I? I protected that thing with my life. If we fell off a building, I would do everything in my power to break its fall. I had no idea. I had no idea my love for this phone was so powerful. So crushing. 

And **I hate myself**. I have hated myself for the past three days because I have been so goddamned upset about a fucking phone. It was my own really nice thing for myself, I'm not a rich person. I thought, I'm pretty cool about not getting too attached to material shit or money. I've lost shit I've loved before and got over it. No problem. Oh god, how I was wrong. I had no idea. What the fuck is this? 

The constant habits are killing me. Checking my back pocket. All the time. Quick thought to look up when something closes. What time is it?   Fuck! Bathrooms? Fuck them. I hate them. Empty, lonely, cold, tiled hells. 

Why didn't anyone warn me? Am I the only one that actually got that obsessed? I don't even really have a lot of friends, so it's not that being unable to see their facebook every 3.5 minutes is really killing me. What's really killing me is my solitaire. My records. Do you know how goddamned good that app is? Best solitaire game in the world. Better than any computers', better than any other phones'. It was perfect. I played that shit before bed, every night. I had peaceful, nice sleeps. Now, I haven't been able to fall asleep till 3 or 4 am. I thought it'd get better, but it's just getting way worse. 

How did I get so wrapped up in it? I even have AT&amp;T, so I know I was getting fucked in the first place. Stockholm syndrome. I guess. Or it's a drug.

When I got to class, I pulled out my keyboard, turned it on, and made a keypress. This wakes up the ipad in my bag. I'd open my bag a little to double-check if the screen came on.

And from there, it was just me and the keyboard. I'm a relatively fast typer, and my accuracy is around 95%, but accuracy isn't important to me while I'm taking notes. The apple bluetooth keyboard is surprisingly quiet, and without a screen in front of me I feel less distracted. And something interesting I noticed was that I was just about the only person in the room who was actually looking at the professor while he/she was teaching.

I didn't have a single ""fuck up"". Every time I wrote notes, they were recorded on my iPad. I developed a basic system of formatting and syntax to record when the prof or myself made errors in the notes, and to write efficiently.

And the classes I'm in aren't philosophy or english or anything like that. I'm in software engineering and computer science classes. I was able to write down code and algorithms, with nested structures and such, without much of a problem. Oddly enough, I found myself focussed more on the material than when I was writing with a pencil or even a laptop (because I had to visualize the notes in my head, instead of just copying whatever was written/spoken by the professor).

If I ever needed to jot down a diagram, it wasn't much effort to lift my iPad out of my bag, scribble it down, and continue.

I got a few weird looks, but if you are using an iPad in class, you're probably used to it to some extent.

I've heard this can also work with iPhones and Android phones, so try it out if you get the chance!

This turned out to be a very interesting cognitive and social experiment. I've got a MacBook Air now, so I don't think I will be using this method anymore. But to those of you out there who don't own a laptop but enjoy using a keyboard, you can save a lot of money by using this method. Haters gonna hate; as a student, any opportunity to save money is usually a good idea.
