Ask away!,"I did [a few](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/jbiji/iaman_iphone_ipad_ipod_touch_specialist_have_any/) of [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/era9t/iaman_iphone_ipad_ipod_touch_specialist_have_any/) a while ago, and since they were quite popular, I thought I'd do it again.
I've been working with iPhones since they were released in 2007, and consider myself quite an expert on the field, especially on the software side.
If your device has a strange quirk, you want to know how to jailbreak it, how much it's worth, or anything else, feel free to ask!  

Edit: I'd also like to ask that you upvote this post. It's a self-post, I don't get any karma for it, but more people will see it and thus get helped.

However with the updates such as the share button/iCloud tab sync to the new OS I had wished they included them to be compatible for firefox or chrome. I really like these features but have always been a Firefox guy, just wondering if I am missing out on other features of Safari and if you guys think it is not a bad idea to switch. Thanks!


EDIT: Thanks everyone for the responses!

after updating me and my girlfriends phones to ios 6, our data usage went over, and we were charged with a $900 bill. my girlfriend has never gone even close to her limit in the years shes had her plan, and all of a sudden went over by $900... so i started googling and found this. hundreds of people are experiencing insane data usage overages and vodafone is refusing to refund it. after a week of dicking around with customer service, the most i could get them to do is agree to drop the bill if i upgraded my data package. so i got the $900 bill to go away, but now i have to pay an extra $30 a month for a year. hardly ideal. the guy in the store i talked to said it was a known issue and vodafone is refusing to acknowledge it.

it's terrible for a phone company to be able to rob hundreds of people of thousands of dollars. some people had excess charges of $3000+. imagine all the people who don't know anything about smart phones or how data works, or what they're doing on their phones that could easily be talked into ""well look here this shows everything you've done and its definitely your fault"". if we didn't have a contract and didn't want to ruin our credit we 100% would've switched carriers, and we definitely won't be renewing our contract next year.

mac,Run Windows 8 off USB on your Mac,"I just got Windows 8 to go working on my mid 2012 Mac Book Air. Like many people with this laptop I have a puny 128GB SSD and don't want to waste space for Windows when I only need it from time to time. It's not easy but with a little time you can install Windows 8 to USB and run it from your flash drive instead of your main harddrive. The speed is not bad. My Mac doesn't have usb 3.0 so the speed is limited by 2.0 but its definitely usable and I was playing world of warcraft on windows 8 with minor slow downs.



**What You'll Need**

1) A usb drive. The faster the better. It will fit on 16GB but 32GB will give you more space to install applications. An external hard drive will also work. Some flash manufacturers sell certified Windows to go flash drives for a premium. They are not necessary but do make it easier.

2) Windows 8 disk or iso

3) Windows 7 or 8 computer. I did it on a Windows 8 computer but I don't think Windows 7 would be a problem.



**Copy Boot Camp drivers to your build computer**

1) Format your usb drive as FAT

2) Start boot camp assistant and select ""download the latest windows support software from apple""

3) Use your newly formatted usb drive as the destination

4) Remove from MAC and stick in Windows build computer

5) Copy WindowsSupport directory to your windows build computer



**Preparing your USB drive**

All These instructions come from : http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/win8togo


1) Download RMPrepUSB from here: http://www.rmprepusb.com/documents/release-2-0

2) Format your flash drive using the following options: 3. Win bootable (BOOTMGR), 4. NTFS and Boot as HDD

3) Download Windows 8 Waik tools here: http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/getwaiktools/GetWaikTools.zip?attredirects=0

4) Open a administrator command prompt and go to the new downloaded tools folder

5) Assuming your windows 8 source is at k: and your usb flash drive is at u, type

                ImageX.exe /apply k:\Sources\Install.wim 1 u:

6) That takes 20-60 minutes depending on speed then type:

               BCDBOOT u:\Windows /s u: /v

7) Slip the Boot camp drivers into the installation

               dism u:\ /add-driver /driver:*BootCamp Directory*\Drivers /recurse

8) Copy the WindowsSupport bootcamp directory to the new USB



**Starting Windows 8 to go**

1) Insert usb drive into Mac, start or restart the computer

2) Hold down the option key while the Mac is booting

3) Select the windows drive and hit enter

4) Wait



**After Windows is running**

If you're not using one of the designated certified windows to go drives then Windows doesn't work as expected in some cases. To trick Windows into thinking the flash drive is standard non-removable drive do the following:

1) Download the cfadisk usb filter driver here: http://www.fileden.com/files/2011/12/22/3242144/microdrive.7z

2) Open an administrator command prompt and type the following:

            bcdedit /set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS
            bcdedit /set testsigning ON

3) Go to device manager and update the usb flash driver with the downloaded one

4) Reboot while holding down the option button

5) Go to windows explorer, your drive should show up as a normal disk drive and not a removable drive.



**Completing the Boot Camp installation**

1) Go to your bootcamp directory and run setup.exe. That should get all your hardware recognized

iphone,"Spent the last 2 years making my dream music app, a full band tab sequencer called Jam Maestro. Today it is released! Please check it out.","Over 2 years ago I got tired of waiting for someone to make the only app I wanted on my iPhone - a guitar tab music sequencer. I wanted to be able to compose guitar music on the bus to work and there just wasn't anything. So I decided to learn how to program and write it myself. 

It was a long journey and I had to rewrite it several times, however I refused to compromise on my dream for the app, and as such I can proudly say today its everything I dreamed it would be. 

The app is called Jam Maestro, and it allows you to sequence 2 guitars, bass and drums together using guitar tab format and play them back in symphony. Think guitar pro but designed for composing rather than learning songs. I have also designed all the instruments so they have maximum playability on the iphone rather than trying to emulate how a real guitar works. 

Full features of the app are listed here: www.jammaestro.com

Here is a video tutorial I made which demonstrates the true power of the app: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGeCayufgs 

Here is another short one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzatkVQKJ7M showing tab playback (a cover of a BTBAM song, but shows the kind of sounds you can get out of it).

I released the app today world wide for only 99c (or there equivalent in your country). If you would like to check it out you can find it on the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jam-maestro/id596628003?mt=8 .

Thanks for reading, and for those that try it I would appreciate any feedback you can give me! Regardless of its type =)

EDIT: I should have said - feel free to email me at support@jammaestro.com if you have any questions, especially about how to use it, and I'll be happy to help in any way I can. 

EDIT2: I'm climbing the charts in USA/UK/CAN guys! If you have the app a review on the app store would be very much appreciated!",112,227,2013-02-23,AAPL,0.01961878128349781,0.9222065806388855,0.058174584060907364

**Burnout CRASH!** - A very fun lite version of the console games.

**Bastion**- a fantastic if somewhat short game

iphone,"I'm developing an iPhone app for solo travelers, curious to know what you think.","Having traveled alone for almost all of last year, I realized there is no good app for solo travelers, aside from couchsurfing which I find doesn't have a very well developed app at all. So I decided to develop an app, I've done all the design work and have someone currently coding it.

Basically the app allows you to see others traveling to the same country/city you're going to during the same time(think of it almost like a match-making service), and then you can message them and travel with them if you decide to.

You can see other users nearby (obviously you have the option to hide your location) and message/connect with them.

There is also a virtual passport feature where you collect stamps for every city you check in to.

I created a simple landing page for now at www.backpackrapp.com and the name is temporary as it's still early in the development phase.

This is not simply a retooling of the classic email client.  The following is taken directly from the Mailbox [privacy policy](http://www.mailboxapp.com/privacy/);  
      
*****
 
For starters, you will no longer have a direct, secure link between yourself and your email service, as Mailbox requires your email to be passed through their own servers. All of it;
&gt;  Mailbox is designed to help you manage your email account with other providers, like Gmail. When you link your email accounts (provided by third parties) to Mailbox, you give Mailbox permission to securely access your information contained in or associated with those accounts.  

***** 

One red-flag is that they make no assurances as to what will happen to your information if their service is bought by someone else;  
&gt; The assurances in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information if/when itâ€™s transferred to a new entity. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you **may have** regarding your personal information.
    
(emphasis mine)  The wording is pleasant, but take into consideration that they *could* just promise that, in the event the service were to be sold, you would be given the option to prevent the transfer of your data to the new ownership entity.
So the real question is what they intend to do with your data.  

*****

A second red flag might be this line;  
&gt; We will never share, rent or sell your information to third parties outside Orchestra and its group companies (including subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below...
    
The term ""affiliates"" makes this claim rather vague, as any company at any time could become affiliated with Orchestra, Inc.  

*****

&gt; If you link your third party account to Mailbox, that third party may also pass certain information along about your use of its service.  
    
... I'm not sure what this one even means.  Is Google going to send Orchestra, Inc. information about my Google services usage?  Why?  
    
*****

edit:  made the formatting *slightly* less horrible

edit 2:  As it may not be obvious to the average user, **deleting this app will not stop the service from grabbing your email**.

apple,New Mac? Lesson attack!,"**TL;DR** *A friend is finally making the switch from Windows to Mac. I wrote her this guide to get up and running quickly and solve some common annoyances with the OS.*

Ok, so here's a semi-organized assortment of things you will want to do to make your user experience a lot nicer.

First, get used to the new keyboard shortcuts. Command (CMD) pretty much replaces Control from Windows. That's confusing because there's also a Control key - but you'll hardly ever use it. Option is your new Alt key. Holding Option and clicking things tends to give you extra choices to use - things a typical user wouldn't want to bother with.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

* CMD+Space opens the Spotlight window, which VERY quickly lets you search for files and applications to launch. It's how I open everything.
* CMD+Q quits the application
* CMD+W closes the current window
* CMD+Shift+3 takes a whole-screen screenshot and saves it to the desktop
* CMD+Shift+4 lets you drag the mouse to save a screenshot of a portion of your screen
* Option+Right-Clicking an icon in the Dock will let you Force Quit frozen applications
* CMD+Option+Shift+Right-Clicking an icon in the Dock will REALLY let you Force Quit a frozen application pretty immediately.
* CMD+I Opens the Inspector, which shows you a file's properties.
* Holding CMD and clicking lets you reposition items in the menubar. You can even drag them out to remove them entirely.

**Applications to get (free unless otherwise noted)**


* [Xtrafinder](http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) - Brings tabs to Finder and lets you cut/paste files. (By default, you can only copy/paste. It's dumb)
* [Cinch](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/) (free trial) - Lets you resize windows by dragging to the edges of your screen, just like Windows 7 introduced.
* [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) - Really good FTP app, if you're into that sort of thing.
* [Dragoman](http://dragoman.en.softonic.com/mac) - Bulk convert file types very easily. Something that only comes in handy every so often, but when it does - wow!
* [GrandPerspective](http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) - Lets you visually see where disk space is being most used. Don't be alarmed by the SleepImage file's size. That's a copy of what's in RAM, and protects your work during accidents.
* [MPlayerX](http://mplayerx.org/) - Use this for movie watching. VLC has become kind of bloated since the 2.0 release, and MPlayerX has more support for different codecs anyway.
* [TinkerTool](http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html) - Allows you to easily change hidden system preferences.
* [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) - Incredible lightweight torrent client.
* [CheatSheet](http://www.grandtotal.biz/CheatSheet/) - Lets you hold Command for a few seconds to pull up a list of all the keyboard shortcuts supported by the application you're currently in. VERY useful.
* [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) (free trial) - Incredible menu bar calendar app. Great gmail integration!
* [Sparrow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id417250177?mt=12) (paid) - Badass gmail app. If you're looking for something outside of the browser to do emails, skip the native Mail app and try this out.
* [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) - duh. do it.

**Default settings to change**


* In System Preferences under Language and Text you should disable ""Correct spelling automatically"" because it's super annoying.
* In System Preferences under Security and Privacy, click the Lock in the bottom left to make changes and Allow Applications downloaded from Anywhere to run on your Mac. It's YOUR Mac!
* Right-click the Dock (easiest by the big open space near Trash) and turn on hiding. You have a 13"" monitor - reclaim some space!
* Launch Terminal, then paste this in and hit enter. It kills the DashBoard, which is awful.
* defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES
* Launch Terminal, then paste this in and hit enter. It reveals your hidden ~/Library/ folder, which is like the windows equivalent ofâ€¦ something good. You'll wind up messing with these files eventually for some reason or other, so it's a good idea to unhide it.
* chflags nohidden ~/Library/
* Using Tinkertool:
* Under Applications, check the thing for Downloads not showing the quarantine warning. It's annoooooooying.
* Under Dock Options, try out disabling the 3D effect and see how you like it. I definitely prefer the 2D dock.

**Random Stuff**

* Scrolling works on background windows now. This is a nice change from Windows, where you had to click and change the main window focus to be able to interact with a program or folder.
* Dragging files in/out of windows and applications now works extremely well. When in doubt, if you don't see an import button, just find the file/picture/text and drag it in.
* In System Preferences under Language and Text you can add keyboard shortcuts, like in iOS. I have it set to replace ""eml"" with my email address.
* In System Preferences under Users and Groups you can add/remove applications that launch at login.
* Activity Monitor is the name of OSX's version of Task Manager (what you'd open during a CTRL+ALT+DEL to view system processes)
* Finder works most like Windows Explorer in List view.
* If you ever find that the default application that launches for a certain filetype isn't what you'd prefer, launch the Inspector (CMD+I) and go down to ""Open with."" There, you can select the right application, then Change All to apply that update across the operating system.
* Don't just randomly paste things you find on the internet into Terminal. You can screw things up - especially if Sudo is in front of it! Make sure you understand exactly what it's doing first. Obviously, since I'm your pal, the things I recommend will not break your shit.
