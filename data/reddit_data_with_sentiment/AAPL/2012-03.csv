apple,iPad3 might have haptic feedback. That would definitely make one have to see it and TOUCH it to appreciate it.,"[Here](http://theweek.com/article/index/224970/apples-mysterious-ipad-3-invitation-3-takeaways) is the rumor itself.

[Here](http://cnettv.cnet.com/senseg-demos-prototype-touch-feedback-technology/9742-1_53-50115714.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody;1n) is a video of the technology itself. Note that this isn't the brute force buzzing haptics we all know, but something more that makes the idea of haptic use in technology a much more elegant and desirable idea.
     
[Here](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/24/apple_investigating_multi_haptic_feedback_for_multi_touch_devices.html) is a link to a patent that apple has filed on haptic tech.

It seems feasible if the technology itself works as touted in practice. Battery life might be an issue, but I have no idea how energy hungry such tech is. It is my understanding that this is an evolution of traditional haptics and may be more efficient than traditional implementations. Or it may not be.

*I realize this is merely a rumor, however, how do you think the haptics itself would impact you personally as an addendum to the iPad3's list of features*?",167,82,2012-03-02,AAPL,0.013216682709753513,0.9100094437599182,0.07677391916513443

apple,Genius Bar Rep Saved Me from Starvation and/or Catching Fire.,"Today I took my laptop into apple to see why it nearly catches fire every time I turn it on and to see if I could exchange my 5 year old power cable (based on that class action law suit).
I went to the genius bar and the rep ran some diagnostics and said that my battery needed to be replaced and my power cable didn't qualify for the replacement plan. He said a new battery was $100 and the cable was $70.
I said ""I'm on a tight budget."" Before I could say another word he said ""hold on"" and disappeared. 
When he came back he started installing a brand new battery then handed me a receipt for $0. Then he looked at my power cable and said, ""Well, that's a fire hazard"" then proceeds to ring up a brand new cable for $0. 
He said that being able to do things like this was the whole reason he started working for Apple; also that he had been promoted and it was his last day working in that store. 
I gave him several hugs and have not stopped smiling all evening. Thank you Apple employee whose name I can't remember (because I'm bad with names, not because you weren't rememberable). Because of you I will not catch fire and I won't starve this month. 

**TL;DR** Apple rep gave me free battery and cable because I'm poor and he's wonderful.",19,41,2012-03-03,AAPL,0.03775499761104584,0.8956188559532166,0.0666261836886406

I hadn't used it in a few hours, and its last known location was my city's main public library (not a place I would consider leaving anything unattended for more than a moment).  Wasting no time I jump in the car and speed back to the library hoping that there is any chance it is still there. To my surprise some kind honest person had found it where I left it and took it to the reference desk. Amazing!

apple,"So, with iPhoto for iPhone, iPad and Mac + PhotoStream, what the heck is the workflow?","Consider this hypothetical situation:
Person has an iPhone, Mac Mini and iPad. This person goes on a short trip to another place, bringing just the iPad and iPhone. They also take all their photographs using the iPhone. Photo stream will automatically push the photos to the other devices, perfect. 

But with iPhoto in the equation, it just seems like a disaster to do some edits on the iPhone, then beam them to the iPad to finish. The album organization is completely lost. You could take photos and sort them into albums in the photos app, beam to the iPad and they all go into an album called ""beamed.""

Alternatively, everything could be downloaded from photo stream on the iPad, but then edits are lost and albums would have to be sorted again.

Finally, there doesn't seem to be a way to take all the edits and changes I made and send those to iPhoto for Mac without exporting to the camera roll. But then all the unedited photos will be automatically downloaded via PhotoStream so, duplications or being forced to re-edit.

No matter what situation you choose, the person will either have many many duplicates, and/or loss of organization and/or being forced to redo edits and organization. It seems like the clear answer would have been utilizing iCloud to keep all three devices the same, or at least some kind of wireless sync/merge functionality like Bento. 

Right now, the only idea I have to better manage is to not use iPhoto for the iPhone, but have photo stream on for backup purposes. Then using the camera connection kit to transfer the photos to an iPad where ALL of the editing will take place - the iPad has photo stream disabled. The best edits are exported to the camera roll, where they can be synced from the iPad to iPhoto for Mac when the person gets home.

Unless anyone else has any better ideas ----- yikes!",32,34,2012-03-10,AAPL,0.04774854704737663,0.9271690249443054,0.025082433596253395

apple,iOS Transmission remote app (torrent),"Well, i wrote an app that let's you remotely control the torrent app Transmission. As expected it was rejected from the App Store, and that is ok.

But i still find the app useful, and imagine that there are more people out there with the same opinion. So, if you want, i'll make sure you can install it on your device. Send me a pm to either get the source code or the signed app for free.

the iPhone app is able to:

* start/pause downloads 
* delete current downloads
* add new downloads from either links or torrent files

for more infos see the very ugly https://sites.google.com/site/idifferentialapp/ or reply here ;)



EDIT: i'll look into the possibility to distribute the app through cydia. in the meantime, to sign the app i'd need the devices UDIDs. don't know if there is other way to distribute the app without having the udids reallyâ€¦


EDIT2: i added a repo on github, here it is: https://github.com/dfritsch86/iDifferential
just a few remarks:

* first time i am using github, so if i made any beginner's mistakes, please excuse me (and maybe tell me what to do better)

* the app itself just does basic stuff. so if you want to fully configure your transmission client remotely, this is not for you. i was planing on adding more functions in the future, but since it has been rejected, i don't know how and when this will happen.

* feel free to read and improve code (there is lots of room for improvement!). fork as you like, add functionalities if you want to, but leave it public. i'd like to see and use your improved versions too :)

* this was my first obj-c app, so probably there is lot's of stuff that could have been handled better. feel free to comment and criticize, as it is the best way for me to learn :P

*i'll still see what can be done about adding the app to cydia, can't say how long it will take me tho 

EDIT 3 (and last for today):

since lot's of people are asking per pm and here, i thought i should explain better what my app does and doesn't do:

my app DOES:

* start/pause existing torrents (by simply tapping on them)
* delete torrents deciding whether to delete or keep the data (swipe to delete)
* add downloads to Transmission by:
 - saving a link to a torrent file in the clipboard (best done in a browser, just copy the link)
 - downloading the actual .torrent file with another app (mail, idownloader ecc) and then importing it in iDifferential
* save a number of different clients each with it's own ip-address, username, password, port number ecc (this is useful for making a setting with the internal ip-address and another with the external)
* set how often the data should refresh


what my app does NOT do:

* edit settings of the client
* show advanced informations like peers/trackers ecc
* automatically open magnet files (but i could implement that soon, as this shouldn't be very complicated)
* pretty much everything else that transmission does.


To make it perfectly clear: my app is very basic and does LESS than the web-gui (but what it does, it does better than the web-gui).

EDIT 4 (so sue me, i lied about the previous edit being the last for today):
i posted the source code and i will try putting the app on cydia.
if you do not want to jailbreak and if you don't have a developer account, the only way to get in on your phone is to send me a pm with your udid. i will then register the first 10 and send them the signed app.",39,63,2012-03-11,AAPL,0.034359440207481384,0.9278889894485474,0.03775165230035782

apple,I'm sick of Adobe.,"Adobe is no longer a company that innovates. Their software has become a continued annoyance in multiple ways. They need to either seriously rethink their products or just go away. Some of the problems I've noticed with Adobe products (at least on OS X) over the years are:

* Tons of crap scattered throughout your computer. The applications folder is a mess with Adobe's crap, and if you dare to delete or move any of these precious files Adobe software freaks out. How hard would it be to create a self-contained application?
* Horrible management of your system's resources. I'm talking everything from hard drive space to CPU usage. Adobe applications are horribly inefficient. Just look at Flash and AIR. They are incredibly inefficient and haven't been refined in *years*.
* An inconsistent UI. Adobe insists on doing things its way, causing their applications to be a real eyesore in OS X. Their window system is confusing and the general design does not fit with the rest of OS X, something that is very important at least for me (and I imagine many Mac-owners).
* Annual (or near-annual) updates to software that cost ~$200, providing only very minor changes that should be free. Buying Adobe products new is even more ridiculous; Photoshop CS5.5 is **$700**!
* Annoying update software that gets in your face.

Adobe should really clean up their product line. It's a shame that they suck so much since some of their applications are very useful, even though they have so many problems.

This is what I think they should do for their software:

* Overhaul Flash and AIR. Rebuild them from the ground-up. Alternatively, destroy them from the face of the earth. Don't worry: if you kill Flash and AIR we'll forgive and forget.
* Get rid of the unnecessary crap in their applications and make their applications self-contained.
* Dramatically improve efficiency and UI consistency.
* Lower the price.
* (Optional) Release their apps on the Mac App Store. I realize, however, that this may be a problem since Apple takes a 30% slice, which would only raise prices further.
* (Optional) iCloud and Auto Save / Versions integration. Not essential, but would be very appealing to OS X users.
* (Optional) Full iOS apps. Give us the complete desktop functionality of Creative Suite and bring it to the iPad. Adobe, you have no idea how much money you would make off of that. Especially if you seamlessly integrated your iOS software with your desktop software.

Adobe definitely can redeem itself, it's just a matter of if they want to or not. Thoughts from the community?

**TL;DR** Adobe software sucks, especially on the Mac. However, they can fix it if they choose to.",261,171,2012-03-13,AAPL,0.0705057829618454,0.8904693126678467,0.0390249565243721

apple,my $23 Leopard itunes server,"So I decided to jump on the new product train and bought a 1080p Apple TV.  After I got it working nicely, I started putzing around the interwebs looking for something cool to could do with my old Gen 1 Apple TV (G1) that was otherwise destined for the garbage bin.  I eventually came across web pages that were talking about loading a compact version of Leopard onto the G1's hard drive and use it as an iTunes server.  BINGO!  Now I've got something cool with the G1 and can solve the problem of having to go back to the office and log in any time I wanted to watch/listen to anything (and a cool project to boot).

I pulled the hard drive out of the G1 and reformatted/repartitioned it, downloaded a compact 10.5.8 Leopard image and loaded it onto the hard drive.  To my surprise, it booted the first time.  Then I remoted in and did a bit of configuring, attached my external media drive via the USB port and imported the lot into iTunes. 

Now my iMac is logged off, I'm streaming to the 1080p Apple TV from the Leoparded G1 and it's working exactly as I had hoped.  The 1Ghz processor and 258mb of ram are far from quick, but so far seems to be sufficient for how I'm using it.

Oh... and the $23... I had to buy a universal USB hard drive reader so I could rewrite the G1's hard drive.",24,43,2012-03-17,AAPL,0.029032737016677856,0.9258865714073181,0.045080725103616714

iphone,Free Aluminium Case Giveaway (Details Inside),"Hey r/IPhone! This past week i've promised to give away a number of cases here. Well, today I received them and I'm ready to give you a chance to get an awesome case for free! 

All you have to do is reply in this thread with 'enter me' and state which colour you want. I will take replies for 24 Hours before picking Four winners.

These cases are IPhone 4S specific for Verizon and the AT&amp;amp;amp;amp;T and will also fit the IPhone 4 Verizon. All European 4S's will be ok. Throwaway accounts will not be accepted or duplicate accounts. I only ask you pay the shipping cost of your choice but please keep in mind I am located in the UK so shipping may cost a bit, depending on where you are.

So that's it guys, good luck :)

Edit: Here is the website for the cases which will go on sale sometime in April. No word on the price yet but they will not be expensive.

http://www.icemdesign.com/yoo/index.php

Edit 2: The cases will be on sale from the 15th April. On the opening day if you order you get free shipping to the UK, Europe or the US. Also if you email the designer at sales@icemdesign and specify which colours you are interested in, you will get a coupon for 5% off your first order. The 5% will be one per person, and this will apply to one case.

I'm still waiting for the pricing but I will update once I have the information. 

Edit 3: There seems to be some confusion about the colours. They are Black, Gold, Red and Pink. If you have not chosen one of these colours please edit your post so you don't miss out. :)

Edit 4: Some more pictures here with the case on the IPhone. If you look at the previously posted pictures you can see that iteration did not include the small cutouts at the Four antenna break points. The addition of these cut outs at the Antenna breaks make it easier for the phone to maintain a good signal. Sorry but i don't have the Blue to give away but it's available on the website when sales start.

apple,PSA: Photo Stream deletion actually deletes from all your devices now!,"When 5.1 first came out, people were excited about deleting pictures from Photo Stream but I remember a lot of complaints about the fact that they were only deleted from the photo stream album *on the current device*. 

Well this morning I deleted a picture from Photo Stream on my iPhone and noticed that the warning message had changed to explicitly state that the photo would get deleted form all my photo stream devices, and sure enough, the photo disappeared from my iPad as well.

Just thought everyone would like to know!

**EDIT: Some clarification from dirtymatt:**

&gt;Photos added to Photo Stream AFTER you upgrade to 5.1 will be deleted on all devices. Photos added before upgrading to 5.1 will only be deleted on the current device. 5.1 added a unique ID to photos uploaded to Photo Stream, allowing them to be deleted across all devices. In 5.0 there was no unique ID, so there was no way for your other devices to know which photo to delete.",18,63,2012-03-20,AAPL,0.06987381726503372,0.8955460786819458,0.03458008915185928

ipad,Ignore the media hysteria. The new iPad is perfect.,"Got my new iPad early this afternoon and have been using it mostly non-stop since then. Some observations:

1. It doesn't get hot. Granted I haven't been playing Infinity Blade or anything, but I did activate LTE and download a bunch of apps. It got unseasonably warm outside here in the Northeast today and I don't have A/C. The iPad still stayed cool.

2. No WiFi problems. It gets a full signal in all but the furthest corners of the house. Basically the same performance as the iPhone 4. I have a crappy LinkSys router and it handles it just fine.

3. No light leakage.

4. The screen is awesome. I still think there is room for future improvement, but basically this is the best screen I've ever seen. I don't see any yellow tint, either.

5. Battery seems great. I still have 23% after 8 hours or so, and have yet to plug it in.

6. I didn't have an iPad 2 but the thickness and weight seem fine to me. It's much more light and compact than any laptop. To quibble over a fraction of a millimeter seems silly.

These articles are just grasping for straws over something to criticize. There's no problem here. This thing is basically perfect.",115,92,2012-03-22,AAPL,0.026251433417201042,0.9194445013999939,0.054304033517837524

apple,My MAC success story: a 5-year laptop,"So there have certainly been a lot of 'I love Apple' posts recently, but I thought it would be worthwhile to add my own. 

I bought a mac for the first time in August 2007 before I started university. I got a Core2Duo macbook (white) and was stoked. Since I have graduated, started grad school, trucked my laptop through rural Africa, published two papers on it, and continue to use it for my everyday tool and during my development/relief work in East Africa.

The battery is still strong (2-3 hours of battery life) after 959 cycles. It has been able to take on snow-leopard (haven't jumped onto Lion yet), and do just about everything that I need to do. I tell my friends that I have had my laptop for nearly 5 years and they are stunned. I have only had one problem (HD crash while in Tanzania) but it was completely restored from Time Machine and a 2 day visit to an Apple Store. Sure the laptop isn't lightning fast, but I don't know many people who still use a computer 5 years old.

For those who say Apple is overpriced. My $1200 mac over 60 months (5 years) averages out to about $20 a month. Not bad.

Looking forward to a new update on the macbook pros. I expect it to last another 5!

apple,SSH to any of your computers using iCloud and Back to My Mac,"I just discovered this recently, and thought others would find it handy. You can SSH to any of your computers that are running, connected to the internet, and setup with iCloud regardless of router configuration/port forwarding/etc. **Just make sure that Back to My Mac is setup and enabled.**

First, to get the domain for your iCloud account, run in the Terminal:

    mDNS -E

You should see some domains start to pop up, one of which will be an icloud.com domain. Copy the entire domain. You can kill the mDNS process by hitting Ctrl+c once you see it come up.

Now that you have this address, you can prepend any of your computer's hostnames to the domain to access them. So for example, to SSH into a computer with the hostname ""meltingice-mac"", I would do:

    ssh meltingice@meltingice-mac.123456789.members.btmm.icloud.com",40,92,2012-03-30,AAPL,0.029383815824985504,0.9369723200798035,0.033643938601017

apple,"Apple denied me service at the Genius Bar on my phone today. When I got home, I learned that my phone was actually still within warranty. I'm not too happy.","I recently was at the Genius Bar and had my 3GS replaced because of a broken volume toggle switch. This was about a month before my warranty expired, and two months before today. My phone is stuck in restore mode now, and I took it into the Genius Bar and he tried to restore it in DFU mode, but it didn't fix it. So when that happened, he proceeded to tell me that there was nothing he could do for me and that I would have to buy a replacement. I have since learned that any time you get a replacement part or phone from apple, it has a three month warranty or you retain you one year warranty. The guy who tried to help me wasn't even a genius. What can I do tomorrow to make sure this doesn't happen again?",134,138,2012-03-31,AAPL,0.1122925654053688,0.8432849049568176,0.044422462582588196
apple,My Father's Apple Success Story: A Love Affair of a Lifetime,"In 1984, my father bought a Macintosh computer in order to help keep track of the finances of his new dental practice.  This was not its only function, as he also used Adobe Pagemaker to create his practice's letterhead and logo, that he still uses today. *[Note from my dad: I also used Pagemaker to edit a Dental Society Newsletter.]*  This original Mac still sits in my father's office, where it is still used to print out labels to adhere to envelopes to send to patients. 
*[If anyone is really interested in seeing this, I can drive up to the office later and get pics.]*

&gt;**UPDATE:** Went to the office and started taking [some pictures](http://i.imgur.com/yIOKD.jpg) and [stuff](http://i.imgur.com/NuI4C.jpg).  When I turned it on, [this happened...](http://i.imgur.com/3R9Am.jpg) &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
  Even my father didn't know what to make of it.  We might play with it some more tonight, but my father's allergies have gotten the better of him so it might have to wait until he feels better. And yes, I know this is a Classic II but I figured I'd post it anyway.  Dad doesn't know where he put the 1984 model atm.  It might be in storage, he said.


As time progressed, it was obvious he needed to upgrade to a better computer and he had several (Macintosh SE, Macintosh PowerBook 170, etc.).  The one I want to point out is the [Macintosh Quadra 660av](http://i.imgur.com/48k0fh.jpg).  My father bought this computer in 1993 for the purpose of keeping track (again) of his practice's finances, and also to print out his employees paychecks.  

He still uses this computer.  In fact, he used Quicken this week to print out this month's paychecks.  [Here is the computer in his office at home](http://i.imgur.com/GSnkZ.jpg).  In this next picture, you can see the payroll that was last typed up [2 days ago](http://i.imgur.com/jgn9uh.jpg).  For shits and giggles, the [About This Macintosh](http://i.imgur.com/fiKc9.jpg) window.  [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/3xaPh.jpg) that this really is me and my father's computer.

This is my father's Apple 19 year old success story.  

*[Sidenote]* Some of you might ask why he hasn't upgraded yet.  My dad subscribes to the ideology *""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""*  It's still working, even after being on ALL THE TIME.  No literally.  It runs all the time.  He doesn't turn it off.  Except for the occasional power outage, I know that thing has been running constantly since we moved into this house in 1996.  I can't remember how it ran in our previous house.

*[Another Sidenote]* He does have a backup computer though, which is what I used in Jr. High and High School.  It's a [Macintosh Performa 550](http://i.imgur.com/F0aj7.jpg) (Sorry the model number is obscured because I put nail polish on top of it).  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/tH42p.jpg) you can see the backup Quicken file that is on the other computer in approximately the same location on the desktop.

apple,Anyone else think apple is sitting on a untapped gold mine with Apple TV?,"The way I see it, Apple TV is a decent, affordable, polished device, but it's missing one huge, glaring feature: Apps.

It seems to me that if apple would only open up an app store for the Apple TV, they'd immediately release the creativity of 1000's iOS developers. It could become one of the top streaming video solutions (competing with roku, boxee, google tv) and probably have a high adoption rate by the HTPC crowd (XBMC, Plex, Boxee users)

It could become a game console, perhaps even sharing some of the iOS game ecosystem (buy for iPhone, get for Apple TV, iPad as well).

Most importantly, a broad adoption rate and willingness to spend money could attract a lot of video services and programming we might not even imagine today. 

I understand the rumors of an actual TV released by Apple, but I don't understand how this couldn't all just work in the current set top box as well.

Am I crazy here, or does anyone else desperately want to see application development for the Apple TV?",66,64,2012-03-31,AAPL,0.020401855930685997,0.9298316240310669,0.04976651072502136
