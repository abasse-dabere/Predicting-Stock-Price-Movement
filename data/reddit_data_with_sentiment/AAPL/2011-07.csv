apple,Is Apple showing us the way forward for software pricing?,"I remember when Apple bought Logic (the music software). My latest copy of Logic before that had cost €1000, and boom, Apple not only completely overhauls the software, but also slashes the price to €499. Last week, they pulled pretty much the same trick with Final Cut Pro X (Let's ignore the overhaul on that for now...). And of course OSX Lion is only going to cost €29.99 and iWork has always been much cheaper than Office.

I'm sure they're not doing this just to be nice. They're doing this because in the end, it will make them more money. 

Let's take Photoshop as an example. I think it's safe to say that most non-professional users are working with a pirated copy of that software. Hell, I know quite a few professionals who are too. In the US, Photoshop CS5 costs $1,010 . Converted to dollars, the exact same software costs $1,467 when bought from Europe. Now I'm not saying this makes it right to pirate software, but I do understand why, in the real world, advanced amateurs and entry-level pros are just not coughing up the dough. 

I'm no marketing expert, but I think it's possible to calculate how many more people would buy software in stead of pirate it if it were available for a flat worldwide price of $299. And I think that's exactly what Apple have done. Just like they did with music, they're making buying software transparent, easy and relatively affordable. In the end, this gets more people to buy software, and more money coming in.",151,152,2011-07-02,AAPL,0.024254202842712402,0.9241752028465271,0.051570579409599304

apple,Why are there so many PC gamers who think anyone who wants to play a game on a Mac is the stupidest person alive? (x-post from r/gaming),"I have a Mac.  I like them.  I have nothing against PCs, and I never have.  I just like my Mac.  I like to play games.  In fact, I play games on my Mac quite often.  There are quite a few of them, and they run very well.  Sometimes I see an ad for a game and it's not readily apparent if it will run on my Mac or not.  Usually these are online games, and you either have to get to the download page to find out the system requirements or you have to register for an account which you don't know if you'll ultimately be able to use until they send you the download link.  So, I tend to use Google instead.  Invariably, I'll find a link to the official forums where someone has asked whether it runs on a Mac or not.  Now, a simple, ""No, sorry"" would suffice.  However, there is also invariably quite a few people who post angry and vindictive things, as if the OP is a horrible person for even asking that question.  ""WHY WOULD YOU EVER PLAY IT ON A MAC??  YOU CAN'T PLAY GAMES ON A MAC!!  THERE AREN'T EVEN ANY GAMES FOR MAC!  NO ONE MAKES GAMES FOR MAC!!!  YOU'RE STUPID!!""  Granted, they have much worse grammar and spelling, but I'm unable to imitate it well enough.

Perhaps there are other people who have experienced it.  I don't know.  Perhaps there are people who feel this way.  Why?  What's so terrible about asking?  As if I'm already not disappointed about the game not running on the Mac, now I have to be insulted?

apple,TIL the shortcut adjusting sound in low intervals is gone in Lion (option+shift+F11/F12),"[example in SL](http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww302/inamle/volumekeyadjustment.png)

The key combination is also reserved in the preference panel.

Holding shift while adjusting sound still works for disabling the sound effect, as do all other popular shortcuts that i know of.

**edit:**
I tried: preference panel, automator, google

Turns out applescript might be able to help:

&gt;tell application ""System Events""

&gt;	set getSound to (get volume settings) as list

&gt;	set Theoutput to item 1 of getSound

&gt;	set Theoutput to Theoutput + 1

&gt;	set volume output volume Theoutput

&gt;end tell

Open AppleScript editor (part of osx) and paste it, compile, run. It adds a fraction of volume. Adjust by increasing ""+ 1"" to ""+ 30"" and you'll notice better that it works.

apple,"What to do with my old slot-loading, 350mhz, 8mb RAM, iMac...?","I have an old slot-loading iMac. It was released in 2000 I believe and is currently running OSX 10.1.

edit: 8mb video RAM, not 8mb RAM. My mistake. This iMac came with 64mb of RAM and I added 256mb to the second slot so it is now 320mb RAM.

edit: I think I'm leaning toward putting OS9 back on it. Then I'll load it up with some classic Mac games and install some old 8bit and 16bit emulators on it, then snag a nice USB controller.

apple,"Rogers offers iPhone on 3 year contract. Warranty only lasts 1 year. Upgrade not possible for 2.5 years. If phone breaks after the warranty expires but before the upgrade period their only options are to pay full price for a new phone or use one of their courtesy phones, a crappy Nokia.","The best deal I was offered was $435 ""upgrade"" to an iPhone 3GS which is what I actually have now. The contract cancellation fee is $360.

If a cell phone provider locks you into a 3 year contract, shouldn't they cover the possibility of the phone breaking for the entire length of the contract because otherwise there is an 18 month period where you are boned if your phone breaks.

Even on a financial level, they will actually lose out on money. If I accept the Nokia E63 they offered as a courtesy which is a terrible phone (I work for a company that deals with a lot of cell phones) I will hardly ever use the data on it because it is basically useless as a web-connected phone so I will likely downgrade my account to get rid of the data-plan so they'd lose out on money.

Fortunately I live in a city with an Apple store and maybe they will be willing to help out. The problem is that the battery is shot (it lasts about 5 or 6 hours before completely dying) and it can be a bit hit or miss as to whether they will help you with a battery issue.

ipad,"Here's the bypass for the TWC application's ""jailbreak"" protection, and instructions on how it was accomplished.","Time Warner Cable's iPad application recently had an update which [prevents people from using it](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/ij0rn/twcs_app_doesnt_work_on_jailbreak/) if it detects that your device is jailbroken.

I created a bypass which can be downloaded [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?69r98juwrhbassw).

1. Uninstall the application from your iPad.
2. If you don't have it already, use Cydia to install AppSync from the **cydia.hackulo.us** repository.
3. Reboot your device.
4. Double-click the downloaded .ipa file above and sync the application to your device.

-----

I don't know exactly why Time Warner wants to play games with paying customers. If they're doing this because the streamed content could be stolen, there are many more practical and well-established ways of ripping TWC content than over an iPad app, as [robhue](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/ij0rn/twcs_app_doesnt_work_on_jailbreak/c246o71) points out.

Additionally, a jailbroken device is no indication you intend on ripping streamed content anyway. If anything, preventing jailbroken users from using the application entirely will only increase the chances of people cracking the application and stealing streamed content. What are they thinking?

In case another company comes along and tries to do this again, I'll point out how they did it. Their developers must have googled ""detect if device is jailbroken"" and got [this](http://petersteinberger.com/2010/03/detect-if-an-iphone-is-jailbroken/) page. They used a similar method, and actually had a debugging setting that allowed *their* developers to use the application on a jailbroken device, but nobody else. LOL

As I suspected, it checked for apt and Cydia. All it took to bypass this was to corrupt those path strings (replacing them with underscores with a hex editor) and resigning the binary using ldone (which can be found on the cydia.hackulo.us repository as well).

If you have any problems (or questions) with the patch, let me know. I can't really test it since I don't have TWC, but I looked over the disassembly output and I'm pretty sure the patch is straightforward.

iphone,Stolen Iphone. Bought and sold by local store. Any options?,"My girlfriend's iphone4 was stolen from behind the counter at her work. As soon as she let me know it was missing I checked Find My Phone, no sign of it. She called the police and they said they'd come down and take a report. After work we went to the nearest AT&amp;T store to alert them and see what our options were. They said a guy had been in earlier trying to sell the phone and they described the case. They wouldn't buy it since they figured it was stolen but they said to try other local cell phone stores. The next place we tried told us they did buy a phone with the same case and that they had already sold it. They said they still had the iphone's case. They had wiped the phone which explains why it wouldn't come up in mobile me. After that the police came to take the report we told them the story and gave them the serial number. Wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what to do next. 

Not sure what the odds are for getting the phone back. Probably a little better since we have a trail of where it went but we aren't counting on it. She got her phone less than six months ago so it would be over $600 dollars to get a new one. I was thinking it might make more sense for her to wait until the new iphone comes out since they might let her early adopt and extend her plan to get that one for $200.

* July 2011: New screen still shows banding and keyboard/touchpad lock up at times leading me to lose data due to a hard shut down.

I took it back to the Apple Store and explained all the new issues and how I've had my computer out of commission for more than I should. I asked if I could get a replacement and if it was possible to pay the difference between the base model and the step-up version of the 15"" (2.2GHz, high-res) since my old one was just the base model and they said they'd see what they could do. The genius went and talked to the manager and, lo and behold, it was the top 2.3GHz model. My jaw dropped. 

People always rip on Apple for having such expensive products but when you have issues constantly with a product and they give you, not just a replacement, but the top-model, that's customer service. I've been a convert since 2005 with my first iBook purchase and I'm never going back.

iphone,iOS 5 beta 3 hands-on review,"It seemed that, with all the iOS 5 beta releases, many of you are eager to know what does the new iOS feel like. In order to satisfy the curiosity, I would like to tell you about my own impression, for I am currently using the up to date Developer Beta 3 of the new software on my iPhone 4. About a dozen of the new features Apple describes on their [website](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html), as well as they were described during they Steve Jobs' keynotes during WWDC 2011.

Most of the new features are readily available in the current Beta stage, and I would like to go over some of the most noticeable and impressive ones in the same order they are described on the website, and tell you my own impressions of it (as oppose to Steve Jobs' impression, that is). And you can always refer to that link up above to find out what all these new features look like.

First off, the new and awesome Notification Center. The name says it all, it combines all of the notifications, like text messages, emails, notifications from apps like Facebook and combines them into a single awesome tool. First of all, when any new notification arrives, instead of interrupting your apps and whatever else you were doing with a pop-up message requiring immediate action, a handy little bar pops up from the top of the screen showing you what app is the notification from, as well as the subject and partial text of the message/email/whatever. You can tap this bar before it disappears in a few moments, or you can just go to the notorious notification center itself. Without quitting your apps you can swipe from the top of the screen and a handy panel fills the screen showing you all the latest calls and messages and other notifications, where you can take any desired action with them. The feature works as promised, indeed very handy and useful. The look of the notifications on the lock screen had also changed accordingly. No more annoying blue notification pop-ups anywhere.

Then there is iMessage, a new messaging tool that uses 3G and Wi-Fi to send and receive text and media, instead of the cellular network. It integrates seamlessly into the Messages app and you don't even see a difference, and neither does your interlocutor using iMessage. Saves you the pain of the network SMS/MMS charges.

Then we go to Newsstand, the new app for those having multiple newspaper and magazine subscriptions on their iOS devices. It combines them all into a single useful app, which allows you to acquire subscriptions for your favorite newspapers and magazines right in the App Store and have them all displayed in one handy place, from where they are easily accessible. As of the current beta stage, the Newsstand app is present, but it's not possible to purchase any subscriptions, because apparently the App Store itself isn't ready yet.

Reminders. A whole new app that takes care of all your task and reminder managing. I am making a very good use of this app right now, a very awesome tool. Apart from normal reminders, which can be set to go off at a specific date and time, there are location reminders, that go off when you either leave or arrive at a specified location. You'll never forget to pick up some milk when you leave home from work anymore. The app very nicely works as a shopping list as well. In fact, up until the yesterday's release of Beta 3, the app icon looked like a shopping list, saying ""Milk / Eggs / Bread"", but apparently they decided that wasn't doing a good job promoting its full potential, so they've removed the words and left the rest of the icon untouched.

Tweeting is now extremely easy, with a single tap you can tweet a photo from the Camera Roll, or location from the Maps, or a video from YouTube.

Some new useful camera features are available, such as a new camera button right on the lock screen. With a single tap on the Home button, you will see an ordinary lock screen, but with a double tap during the phone being ""asleep"", you will see a lock screen with the usual music controls, as well as the new camera button, a tap on which takes you right to the camera app. And to make it even easier to snap a photo as quick as possible and as easy as possible, you can now take a photo by pressing the volume-up button. Literally takes you a second now from the moment you see something interesting and tap the Home button, to the moment when you are taking a photo. If you have a 4-digit lock code set up on your device, the new lock screen camera button will take you to the camera without asking you for the code, but you won't be able to access any of the photos (apart from those that you will be taking) or any other information. Pressing the Home button or otherwise attempting to switch to other apps will require you to enter the lock code. Very nice feature, allowing you to take a photo extremely quick without jeopardizing the privacy.

The Photos app has evolved and is now displaying a few new features, such as basic cropping, automatic colors and brightness correction, red-eye reduction. There is also an option to display the ""rule of thirds"" lines on your screen as you are taking a photo to help you out with the composition.

Safari has two new noticeable features, called Reader and Reading list. With Reading List you can easily save any articles on a website to read them later. Though similar to plain old bookmarks, it is easier to manage - once you read the article it just disappears from the ""Unread"" list. And Reader is a new awesome feature that works well on all of the news websites that I tried. With a single tap on the new ""Reader"" button that appears on the address bar, you are taken to a clutter free version of the article, optimized for comfortable reading.

Mail had received a share of new features as well, such as text formatting, multiple inboxes, grouping of conversations, but I think Steve Jobs would do a better job describing them than I ever would.

The new iCloud is a very exciting new feature but I haven't tested it out yet. Perhaps I will do a little review of it once I update my iPod Touch to iOS 5 also. Right now my iPhone is the only iCloud enabled device that I have.

Apple says there is over 200 new features in the new iOS 5 and I've only described my impressions of some of the most notable ones. And I would be glad to answer any your questions.",84,31,2011-07-12,AAPL,0.027268679812550545,0.9202781617641449,0.05245317704975605

People have been ranting about how Lion seems like a 'pointless' upgrade and it is 'disappointing' from the user end. 

I, as a developer see the launch of Lion differently to the average user. Apple are launching so many new API's with Lion, a big one being the implementation with the cloud, for so long I've wanted to setup a sync service with a product but found it to be far to expensive, this opens up so many windows for developers. Eventually translating to a better user experience.

I've used other people's apple computers before just for small tasks like checking a website and was never impressed. After owning one and using it for just two days, I'm hooked.


While the laptop itself is amazing, OSX is the best operating system I've ever used -- ever. The trackpad gestures, the scrolling, the clean feel of all the applications, and the keyboard shortcuts all make it feel like a better experience than Windows. I also have moderate linux experience, so I love having a shell when I want one. The whole OS feels like an extremely polished version of linux. If OSX had superb gaming support I wouldn't miss Windows whatsoever.

I really can not express how grateful I am for this community.

Two days ago, I posted a thread on /r/iPhone and /r/iPad to announce my latest game for the iPhone/iPad.  Today, thanks largely to the up-votes of a few kind redditors, Apple has featured my game as ""New &amp; Noteworthy"" in the US, UK, Canada, and Singapore (board game) App Stores.

I have released several games in the past, but never really received any attention from Apple.  I am extremely excited and extremely humbled by the exposure Apple is giving after receiving exposure from the Reddit community.  Thank you all so much.  I am completely beside myself.

With it, you can connect a USB Midi device to your iPad (like a midi keyboard or Kaoss Pad or something) and use that to control certain programs. 

It works with Garage Band, iMS-20, a bunch of random keyboard apps, etc. (Just search for CoreMidi on the app store to see what stuff it works with.) From what I understand, it pretty much works with any device that uses a generic midi driver, both input and output.

apple,"It's shit like this, Apple","Two weeks ago, traveling in the mountains of Montana, I was using my iPhone for a camera, shooting pictures of the gorgeous scenery. I sat it in the cup holder of the rental car in between shots.


I came around a bend on a gravel road, and there was a big moose standing right in the road! I reached for my phone...and found it sitting in a glass of iced tea. Yep, 15 minutes or more. Dead. Deader than a doornail. I opened it up, dried it out, then mailed it to a repair shop back home in Dallas. They told me it was dead. Deader than a doornail. No hope. Sorry.


So, I'm at the Apple store today, buying a new Macbook Air, and getting my older Macbook worked on, and just off-handedly told them about my embarrassing story.


""I think we can do something for you,"" the Genius replied. ""No,"" I said, ""It's WATER damage - you guys don't cover water damage.""


""I think we maybe can help."" So I brought him the phone. He checked it out. It was dead. Deader than a doornail. AND it was 34 days out of warranty (which doesn't cover water damage anyway). He gave me a brand new iPhone in exchange!

iphone,iPhone 4 stolen. Worthwhile to report it to the police?,"~~I'm reasonably certain this is what happened: when getting on my bike right in front of my apartment to go to work (8:00 AM), my iPhone 4 dropped out of my pocket and somehow I didn't notice. Later at work I realized I didn't have my phone on me, so I hopped on Find My iPhone and tracked it. My phone appeared to be in my apartment, so I figured I would get it over lunch at noon because I go home for lunch.~~

I tracked it until 9:12 AM and then figured it was for-sure in my apartment, so I stopped tracking it. At noon when I got home, I couldn't find it, so I tracked it again and it had been turned off. I tried calling it and it went straight to voicemail (obviously). Looked all over and retraced my steps but couldn't find it. Been tracking it since to no avail.

**I live in a fairly major city with a very high crime rate. Should I even bother reporting this to the police, or am I just fucked for being so naïve (ie. they won't help)?**

Any help/advice would be great. I don't give a hoot about upvotes or downvotes.

PS: The phone wasn't used for data/texting/calling after it was picked up, and I notified my management company ~~and they will check their cameras for between 9:12 AM and 12:00 PM to see if anyone seems suspicious in front of my building. Probably won't help, though.~~

**Update: My management company sent a maintenance worker to my apartment. After he left, another maintenance worker showed up and stole my phone AND my girlfriend's iPhone. Working with the management company to get them back.**

**Second Update: We offered the guy amnesty in return for being fired and giving us the phones back. He missed his deadline. He will probably be charged with at least one class C felony because of the value of the phones, and I hope my management company will make things right tomorrow morning.**

ipad,IT SysAdmin Apps for iPad 1/2,"Just a little background: I have been an SysAdmin in a Windows shop(s) for about 5 years now, and I am moving away from my laptop when I am traveling / out of the office due to how heavy these things are getting. 


I feel that the apps below for the iPad (1/2) are perfect for your everyday sysadmin, and could be used if you want to chuck your laptop when you are out of the office.


What do I have? 


- x1 iPad 2 (Black) 32GB
- x1 Smart Cover / Belkin Snap Shield
- x1 Apple Bluetooth Keyboard


Here are the apps that I recommend: 

- AD Helpdesk: awesome little tool for your Windows IT Admins. You can change passwords remotely using VPN (L2TP or PPTP) technology unless you have access to your AD network via WiFi.

- WinAdmin: Really nice, neat application that allows you to sort out all of your RDP connections. Remote management galore.

- Join.ME: Join a remote session with an end user to view what is going on. Unfortunetly (to my knowledge) you are unable to control a remote machine, but if you have a frantic CEO call you can have them initiate the session, and then watch what they are doing. Hopefully you can use the WinAdmin app to gain control afterwards and resolve there error.

- LogMeIn: If you use LogMeIn, this application is good to have. 

- Spiceworks (iPhone!): Using Spiceworks, and have your server setup with a NAT or use VPN to get into your network? This app is what you need then... you can now fully manage your ticketing system remotely (create / close / delete) along with view monitoring errors.

- VMWare View: Not that useful, but if you have a VMWare ESX or vSphere env this is a pretty cool tool.

- zaTelenet: Need SSH / Telnet session for your Key Networking Devices? Here you go - easy to use interface ftw.

- iPowerShell: Windows Admins, get this immediately. This is basically a dictionary of Windows PowerShell Commands (1 and 2) for Microsoft Exchange, SQL, and Server 2008.

- Evernote: enough said - management of your notes anywhere. 

- Dropbox: Easy document management and file management where ever you go. 

- FileBrowser: easy file access using UNC connection.



Most of the apps above should be used with a VPN connection into your network (unless you are on your network via WiFi). We use a SonicWALL NSA 240 with L2TP connection, so management on days when I am out of the office is a breeze.

apple,"Buying a MacBook Pro, just a few questions.","First and foremost, I read the sidebar, but I'm not sure whether or not this belongs in applehelp or here, so I'm posting it here. If this is the wrong subreddit, I'm sorry.


I've been using PCs all my life, I'm 21 and work in IT. I'm currently considering getting a 15"" MacBook Pro with the 6750 (I'll upgrade the RAM later, fuck spending $180 through apple when I can get 8 gigs for $50 on Newegg). The main reason I want one is for the aluminum unibody, and also judging by the specs it looks like it'll be able to run games fairly well. Another reason I want this is because I work in IT but I have absolutely no experience with Macs, other than playing Dino Tycoon in elementary school. I currently have an Alienware m11x R2 which I use for work, school, and LAN parties, it's a fantastic computer, but I realize I need something a bit larger.


So I have a few questions, hopefully some of you own the higher tier 15"" and can answer these with your personal experiences:


* I plan to BootCamp it and run Windows 7 (I'll use OSX for school and xp vms at work), so how well does this laptop work in 7? I've heard things about the graphics not switching and that the dedicated AMD card in it doesn't work in Windows, if that's true, then for that reason alone I will not be getting the laptop, so I'm really hoping that the information I was given is wrong.


* Aside from that, how well does the laptop work in Windows 7? I've also heard things about the battery life not being too great when you boot into 7, in which case, if I'm doing anything on the battery I can likely just do it in OSx, but I would also like to hear BootCampers personal experience with battery life in windows. 


* The anti-glare screen, is it worth it? Or is it just a matte screen? I'm currently looking at getting the 1680x1050 glossy, I'm thinking about the anti-glare, but if it's just a matte screen, then I see no point in getting it since the colors are a bit different through matte. 


* One thing that's also deterring me is the fact that there's only two usb ports and no usb 3.0, I'm really hoping some sort of Thunderbolt to usb hub comes out, but for now I suppose I can just use a port replicator if I really need more usb. 


* I understand this isn't a gaming computer, but my intentions are to use it for lan parties, like I do with my M11x, I do have a gaming desktop, so the MBP is not something I'll be playing games on all the time, that being said, in windows, do the games run well? I'd imagine bootcamp doesn't change any hardware utilization when it's in Windows, but I guess it doesn't hurt to ask. 


* I guess my final question would be, is this a good purchase? I know the current line came out in February, I've looked online and noticed mostly they release new designs twice a year for the MBPs, except last year they only did one, so I'm wondering since there's no rumors of a new Intel architecture anytime soon (and hardware releases in general are slowing), would that also mean there's no rumors of a new Macbook in the coming months? I can't find any real speculation for them other than the ""15 inch ultra slim mac"" which I assume will be an Air. Really I'd hate to buy this, then in two months a new line comes out.


Again, this isn't a technical support question, so if it was suppose to go in applehelp, my bad. It's just a few questions before I purchase mine.

apple,So I went back to Snow Leopard,"Hi r/apple

First of all, this is not a rant. I don't hold any grudges. I knew what I was expoing myself to, so I backed up before upgrading, and kept that backup in a safe. And now I thought it would be a good idea to share my experience with you.

I gave myself a week to test Lion. And I didn't like it.

Well, allow me to elaborate. Actually, I liked it very much. But the annoyances were too many, and in the end I decided to go back and wait for them to be fixed. Namely:

* Parallels 5 won't work, so now I have to pay 40€ or do some tricks to convert the virtual machine to VirtualBox. But games don't run well in Virtualbox, and I use my windows VM to play Steam games. Basically I can't play now.
* I lost 2 hours of battery life. It seems that Apple's base apps are not as optimized as in SL. It's not spotlight, it's not a wild daemon running at 100%. It's that the Macbook Air economizes battery when idle, but consumes a lot when running. So I go for idle apps.
* Everything is sloppier. Scroll is **much** sloppier than in SL. SL is silk smooth, Lion is windows-smooth. No pun intended. You know the ""feeling"" when scrolling in a Windows machine.
* This is a quite personal bug, but I can't print because the CUPS https support is broken

So then I thought, what am I missing by going back?

* Mouse gestures. Yeah these are great.
* Mail 5. I'll miss this so much.
* Fullscreen terminal. It made me feel like I was in the matrix.

Actually... nothing else. My software is not ready for Versions and probably never will (an old version of Office, an old version of iWork and source code managed with Eclipse). I didn't use Launchpad and while Mission is cool, for single-spaces workflows, it's not a big improvement over Exposé.

With this post I'd like to share my experience and show that it's not a bad idea to go back if Lion isn't making the cut for you. I prefer to wait some months for releases .2 or even .3 (and check better solutions for my VM problem) rather than working uncomfortably with my laptop and missing battery life.

So, has anybody else downgraded to SL, waiting for some fixes and performance improvements? In my opinion, performance-wise, SL was simply amazing. Using Lion... has converted my Air back into a white Macbook.

No remorse, honestly.",316,175,2011-07-30,AAPL,0.10049480199813843,0.8723838329315186,0.027121417224407196

apple,Cool iTunes feature that doesn't actually exist. (i.e I want),"So when I'm looking through my tunes music library, I can see the play count, and the date I last played.  That's great.

However, I have some songs that I've played over 100 times, even though I know I haven't listened to them very much recently.  It would be nifty to be able to pull up a history of plays for those tracks.  Like a line graph by month/year, showing Jan 2008 - 10 plays, Feb 2008 - 7 plays and so on.

iphone,To AT&amp;T iPhone users unhappy about throttling of unlimited data: Exactly how much data do you use?,"Just to keep things clear, I'm NOT trying to start an argument or anything. 

Recently I've been seeing all the articles about how AT&amp;T will be throttling heavy data users, and a Loy of outcry about it. To those complaining: exactly how much data do you guys use, and on what?

I've been a Verizon user since it came out in February, with the unlimited data plan. In the 6 or so months I've had my phone, I've used around 6gb, according to my iPhones info. And that's collectively, not one month.

How do you guys use data? I thought I was a heavy user... Check email nearly hourly (and receive emails hourly), use safari all the time, alienblue, even Netflix occasionally, but I don't ever seem to go too much with my data.

I'm just curious of why and how some people can use 2+ gigabytes of data on a phone.

Or is everyone complaining because AT&amp;T is infringing on customers' rights, similar to how everyone is complaining about data caps?

Once again, not trying to argue. :D

**EDIT:**
Wow, some of you guys *really* use a lot of data, haha. And it all seems justified. I use Pandora, Netflix, Alienblue as well, but clearly not as much as some of y'all. It just pains me that I don't have an outlet to use all the time on the subway and train to have this much usage =(",112,42,2011-07-31,AAPL,0.06808590888977051,0.9040254950523376,0.02788861095905304
