apple,Just a short story about my Apple experience,"On Thursday I went to get myself a new phone from the Apple store (in Manchester, UK). I'd had a Nexus 4 for some time so it was a bit of a change for me but the 5s managed to tempt me in.

Anyway, I sat down with one of the guys on the shop floor and he talked me through the different contracts etc., I picked one, got my phone and went away a happy man.

The next day, when I was playing about with my new toy, I realised that I'd actually gotten the wrong contract tariff (totally my fault, I needed tethering included on my tariff and in my excitement I forgot to mention this). I rang up my phone provider to explain the situation and they said whether or not I could switch my contract over would be up to Apple as it was an error on my part and the contract was already signed.

So, off I went to the Apple store again, feeling a bit sullen. When I got there I explained my situation to one of the people walking round and he sat down with me straight away and rang my phone provider up. Even though I was at fault for not getting the right contract he told them a white lie, saying it was actually their problem as it had not been put through the system for me, and asked if they'd change it over for them. They seemed happy to do this for me when someone from Apple had asked them to do it and got it all put through for me on the spot. 

That would've been enough for me, but the guy helping me out went even further and gave me a red 5s case for free (retails at £35 in the UK) as an ""apology for dragging you back here"".

Sorry for rambling, I'm just extremely impressed by Apple. They've certainly won themselves a new customer.",182,1023,2013-11-02,AAPL,0.0815909281373024,0.865950882434845,0.05245817080140114
apple,Please fucking back up.,"I just dealt with a client who kept all his photos, from the past 6 years, on a single external harddrive.

Suddenly, that harddrive died. This is [not an unusual thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure). 

I sent the drive to [DriveSavers](http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com), as far as I know, the best in the business, with a world-class cleanroom for data recovery. Sadly, they were unable to recover anything from the drive, as it was too badly damaged from [head crashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_crash). 

It's not difficult or expensive to back up your data. [TimeMachine](http://www.apple.com/support/timemachine/) is built into Mac OS X. You can use an external harddrive, TimeCapsule, or an NAS like a Synology Diskstation.

Additionally, there's automated online backup services like BackBlaze and CrashPlan. 

It's cheap to replace computer hardware. Even if you're broke, a new Mac isn't that difficult to afford.

But data can be irreplaceable. Please, please back up your data, and keep it safe. Always have a regular backup locally, and another off-site, stored safely elsewhere in case of fire, theft, etc.",393,622,2013-11-02,AAPL,0.0656299740076065,0.9091814160346985,0.02518862672150135

apple,This is why apple will keep getting my business for years.,"So yesterday I go to an apple store to get my 2011 15"" MBP (high end model, paid $2400) fixed, its charger port wasn't working. While testing the port at the genius bar, the employee trips on the cable and my laptop suffers a 4 foot drop. Laptop is all dented up but in working condition. 

They kept me waiting for a while and the rage was building inside me. But they apologize a lot after and offer me a replacement which is essentially the 15"" high end retina model right now. On top of that they match my every spec and bump it up so now I end up with a 15"" retina display MBP with 1 TB of an SSD. 

Fuck, I can't be any happier! That was the best customer service EVAR! :D

Tl;Dr : Apple employee drops my $2300 15"" non retina laptop, 3 years old on to the ground. I get a $2650 retina MBP as a replacement.

**Update: Now that the comments are in, I decided to make an overview of your comments. Starting with LastPass, 1Password and KeePass.**

*This is just a copy&amp;paste of the comments here, you can easily find and verify who wrote what if you search for the copied words:*




**KeePass**

* **Pros of KeePass:**

* I've heard several people say they are very happy with KeePass
* I choose KeePass. Because it is the only one to meet two criteria: Opensource, for security reason. Sync all platforms through you choose way(e.g. Dropbox) rather than its own services, again security reason.
* I've tried a bunch of the hosted services, but always ended up hating them or having difficulty accessing them offline. I settled on KeePass, synced via revision control across computers and via SkyDrive to mobile devices. I have successfully opened my KeePass database on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.
* KeePass (and KeePassX for Linux/OS X), for me it's the only choice. Cross platform compatibility is nice, I 'sync' the database using Bittorrent Sync so the database is always up to date on all devices I own (PC, MacBook Air, iPhone and iPad.)
* This. KeePass for Windows machines, KeePassX for linux and OSX. I've left mobile devices out of the equation as I don't really need to access anything else but mail and Facebook from them, so I haven't tested the mobile clients. I was tempted by 1Password until I realized that they have more or less a subscription based pricing model, and no linux (debian) client.
* The KeePass password database file is synced to different machines through cloud service (SpiderOak in my case, been thinking about switching to F-Secure's younited as it becomes available), and the separate key file is moved by usb stick as it doesn't change as often. So even if my SpiderOak account was compromised and my master password was somehow known, the password database cannot be opened as the key file is also needed and is not there. I would guess this scenario doesn't work with mobile devices, last time I checked the key file option was not implemented in any of the Keepass based mobile clients.
* My keepass database lives on a small usb stick I always carry around with me, so i can use it at work (PC workplace)
* I've never had any problems with it in OSX (I've used it on Mountain Lion and Mavericks). I'm currently using 0.4.3
* 0.4.3 is the latest stable version of KeePassX and I'm running it without problems on i7 Air. 
* I would recommend KeePassDroid on Android
* Kypass on iOS is just a copy that someone took the source code for from minikeepass (an open source application), made a couple changes then decided to charge $6 for it. Look at the UI's if you need proof.
This is the case for almost all non-free keepass iterations on iOS.
* Kypass offers direct DropBox integration so when I make changes they are automatically synched. MiniKeePass requires manual import/export. By using Kypass on my iPad and iPhone and Kypass Companion on my laptop I never have to think about which version of the file I'm using. 

* **Cons of KeePass:**

* i'm running a slightly earlier version than 0.4.3 because i need to keep the database compatible with a keepass app I use with my BlackBerry. It's slow on OSX, doesn't allow me to copy and paste passwords and the representation of words in the boxes is way of. i actually have a WinXp with VirtualBox to use the PC version of keepass on all my macs. I've tried to use it on lion, mountain lion and mavericks and for my impression it has to do with mono. Mono doesn't render the right click menus correctly and therefor also doesn't correctly render a selection for copy/paste. Starting KeepassX can take a solid 5 minutes before showing up on screen. This on an i5 MacBook Air and an i7 Mac Mini.
* I don't use SkyDrive. Revision control? No thanks, I don't need to manage my own sync service.




**1Password**

* **Pros of 1Password:**

* I swear by 1Password. I use it on OS X and iOS
* I'm happy with 1Password. Never switching to anything else. Dat iCloud sync.
* iCloud sync (also dropbox if you're into that)
* 1Password lets you use Dropbox for sync.
* Dropbox is more useful IMO because then you can use it on non-Apple devices.
* I feel better knowing that my passwords are on my two-step verification Dropbox.
* Browser extensions for Safari/Chrome
* Really well done iOS app, not just a skinned HTML5 app
* Ability to store logins and software/license keys
* Automatically clears your paste buffer when you copy a password after X seconds (default is 90)
* Security audit shows weak, old, and duplicate passwords
* version 4 was released recently, and it was a complete overhaul, given to MAS customers at no charge
* Agile put 1P 4 on sale for everyone to make the hit a little bit easier to take
* 1Password has changed its algorithm since [then](http://www.informationweek.com/security/encryption/security-fail-apple-ios-password-manager/232602738), even before 1Password 4. See [this blog post](http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/04/09/1password-ios-pbkdf2-goodness/)
* I'd suggest you take a read of [1Password's keychain design](http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/agile_keychain_design.html)
* I wasn't aware of anything bad happening. I was a 1password 3 user. Now I'm on 1P 4 and still extremely happy with it.
* in recent years, I've gotten tired of working on tech stuff, and just want tech to work for me. 1Password provides enhanced security along with great usability and convenience.
* I've always found them to be very responsive

* **Cons of 1Password:**

* Their android app isn't great but at least they have one.
* One thing that I do like with LP (LastPass) over 1P (1Password) is that LP's browser integration works more seamlessly for me than 1P's.
* I wonder if AgileBits has fixed whatever weakness was used to recover the master password [in 5 seconds](http://www.informationweek.com/security/encryption/security-fail-apple-ios-password-manager/232602738), which seems likely since the iOS app had a major overhaul last year
* 1Password 3 for iOS was the version that was the most affected by [this](http://www.informationweek.com/security/encryption/security-fail-apple-ios-password-manager/232602738).
* I just can't stand how expensive it is. To have the OSX and iOS versions puts me out nearly $75
*  it sounds like Agile is hiding behind the fact that Dropbox changed their API, in order to get users to pay $17.99 to upgrade to maintain the same level of service plus some new features
* While I love 1password I've really fallen in love with iCloud Keychain.
* The latest reviews for 1Password include a lot if 1 star ratings from people that used to be very happy. Can anyone shed light on what happened?
* Granted only 34 reviews for this version but a lot of 1 Stars...
http://i.imgur.com/xioY1ja.jpg
* They make a good product, but I don't think they're a nice company. I've emailed them a few times for customer service issues, and never got a response. Disappointing.




**LastPass**

* **Pros of LastPass:**

* LastPass is highly cross-compatible with different web browsers and mobile devices.
* Lastpass has [two factor authentication](http://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&amp;id=1696)
* 2-factor auth with Google Authenticator is pretty sweet though. Except when Google fudges an update and it blows the app's data away.
* LastPass because it's free and easy, plus it's available for pretty much every platform/browser.
* I went with LastPass because they offered me free 6 months on my school email to give it a spin. I come from the old school days of using the password manager in my click-wheel BlackBerry. This is an upgrade from that, so it's all good to me.
*  I have been using them (mac only) for a year and am raving about them. if there are even better options out there, I'm quite interested in hearing what makes them so.
* I've been using lastpass for quite a while now and really like it. I don't see any reason to switch at the moment.

* **Cons of LastPass:**

* I use LastPass as well. I don't like it, but need to continue using it (just the free browser version) anyway.
* I also use LastPass for other non-personal purposes and I hate the whole interface and how everything is structured. 
* Lastpass's UI gets on my nerves and it worries me that all of my passwords sit on their servers. I feel better knowing that my passwords are on my two-step verification Dropbox.
* I paid for LastPass Premium as well, for a year, until I felt your second point (passwords sit on their servers) was an issue.
* Used to use 1Password 3, stopped using any, moved to Lastpass and then moved back to 1Password 4


**/// UPDATE /// One day later after starting this post here on Reddit, LastPass launched a new version with a new design**

- LastPass 3.0 Is Here: New Design, New Features!
http://blog.lastpass.com/2013/11/lastpass-30-is-here-new-design-new.html

Here are some reviews from users of the [Google Chrome extension of LastPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd/reviews) after the 3.0 update:

&gt; I used to love this extension. The latest updates have ruined it! It keeps throwing some new popup over my logins and cropping the information it's trying to show. - [Jim Fell](https://plus.google.com/104594180061457134351)

&gt; Doesn't work anymore since this latest update. I can't trust a company to maintain the security of my passwords if they can't even push an update without breaking everything. [Tony O'Grady](https://plus.google.com/115637862294677461218)

&gt; Absolutely ruined it with this update. It's now broken across the board. Barely functions in my home installation of Chromium, and won't allow me to login (using same password, which I use on the website and works fine) on my work computer. Well done, screwed over your Premium customers. - [Arran Huxtable](https://plus.google.com/108816093967447982700)

&gt; This program is so flighty! It works, it doesn't work, God knows when it will work. What is the point?? I still have to write down every password. I use Chrome and FireFox and both extensions stopped working altogether! Then it stated I needed to upgrade to current version, WELL hello?? It started me as a new subscriber and dumped all my passwords! HOW can you tell me this is secure when it's so fricking buggy. And there is ZERO support. - [Debra Twardoswki](https://plus.google.com/114712838371680921628)

&gt; It has worked great for about a year or so but all of the sudden today all of my passwords and everything is gone like I just started the account. I am looking for a new app that isn't going to completely SCREW ME. - [Casey Underwood](https://plus.google.com/111839477160256302187)

&gt; The new version is just awful! bring back the perfect design you had! to copy the password for a website I need to do 5 clicks now, whereas previously it was only 1! suggestion: just fire the new UX designer. - [Khachik Badeyan](https://plus.google.com/105265773449254932624)

&gt; Which idiot designed this new UI - terrible. I am glad my premium account expired at the turn of this month - I will be moving to a different client. Multiple menus just to select autofill? A joke - [Chris O'Shea](https://plus.google.com/103370753109508293608)

&gt; Worst. Update. Ever.
&gt; 1. It now takes 3+ clicks to autofill a site when it used to be two.
&gt; 2. It puts little icons in form fields even when I turn off that preference.

&gt; They made big changes to the look and feel of this today and it changed nearly all of my Preferences. It shouldn't have done that. Also when I click on the LP Chrome Extension icon in the browser bar, it now has ""Show Matching Sites"" which I have to click to see all my logins for a certain site. Then I have to click the one I want and click AGAIN to autofill the login form. That's like 3 or 4 more clicks than before.

&gt; LastPass is great, but the latest update has made it unusable for me. There are some web forms on the admin side of my web page that LastPast causes to lock up for about 30 second or more on every page reload. It seems that the large number of fields available on the page is making LastPass freak out. The last version wasn't pretty, but it at least worked. This makes it unusable for me, and I've had to uninstall it from Chrome. On a side note, the Android app is ugly and hard to use, and really needs some sort of integration into the Android version of Chrome. - [Tim Stanfield](https://plus.google.com/+TimStanfield)",95,146,2013-11-03,AAPL,0.07558613596484065,0.8827001005411148,0.041713782120496035

apple,Question: Fan noise on MacBook Pros?,"Hi everyone,

I'm considering buying a MacBook Pro to supplement my iMac. I'm focusing on the 13"" for portability. Right now I'm looking at the low end version (for the hard drive space), or perhaps the mid-range retina version (for the graphics card, RAM, and SDD space).

I work in audio, so the noise level of the machine is important. My last/current laptop was a Powerbook 12"" Aluminum PPC (still running strong, by the way) and was quite shocked at how extremely loud the fan was when attempting complicated tasks. Of course, technology has come a long way, and I'm curious how noise holds up on current models.

This is pretty hard to test in the Apple Store environment. Can anyone comment on fan noise when the MacBook Pro 13"" is working hard? Info on other models is appreciated too.

Thanks in advance, folks.

EDIT: Looks like fan noise is diminished greatly from earlier models. It also seems like the best option is to get an SSD to minimize noise and battery drain, a mid-to-upper range 13"" to handle intensive audio tasks, and expand with external storage.

I'm going to post charts of some basic trends that were observed, but please feel free to use the data provided to make more detailed conclusions/charts/averages/etc.

There were some responses that were obviously flawed. I did my best to eliminate the garbage data. In this “cleansed” doc, I removed all responses that claimed the phone died; had over 75% battery life remaining after the test; or did not give all the data the was requested. 
I also did a rough calculation of the total number of hours each iPhone had been used (as seen in the charts). 
Hours of use per day x Months of ownership x 30

The things that bother me about the iPhone - better but pricier apps, smaller screen than HTC one (or even the S2 I have now), lack of swype for input (am i mistaken here?). Things I like about the iPhone - much much better camera, iCloud, seamless integration with macs, design.

iphone,PSA about charging your phone (x-post from /r/Android),"There are a lot of misconceptions about charging cell phones, largely stemming imo from the older nickel-based batteries. The simplest way to put the matter is, with lithium ion, it's best to charge whenever possible. The higher the percentage, the better. Now, there is a bit more to that... Lithium ion batteries do not have memory issues like the older types do - if you charge it at 90%, or 20%, or even 01%, it does not affect the 'virtual' longevity of the battery. In addition, the lifespan of a lithium ion battery isn't significantly affected by what percentage you charge it at - they are rated for a certain amount of charge/discharge cycles (commonly 300-500, although this does vary), and charging from 90% to 100% is the same as charging from 00% to 10%. However, a full charge/discharge cycle does put more stress on the battery - you might have a small gain of lifespan if you charge with a smaller discharge depth. So you should be fine to let it drain, but if you're an OCD optimizer like I am, you're going to want to charge when you get the chance.

Drawing from this, if you do keep your phone on the charger, you don't have to really worry about it affecting your battery too much. The best case would be to eliminate draw (powering down phone, and thereby eliminating any need to recharge if the draw is higher than the charge), but this isn't really necessary - the difference is negligible. The major issue is extended periods of low/high battery charges - if you're going to leave your phone off for a month, try to keep it between 40-70% charge to minimize the degradation of capacity.

For more information, feel free to ask questions, or check out the pages I listed below.

(note: i also posted this in a comment in the moto x subreddit)

EDIT:

TL;DR: Charge whenever possible. The lower the depth of discharge the more longevity, but it doesn't make a big difference either way.

apple,Mavericks Power Key Behavior?,"Since I updated to Mavericks, I've noticed that apple has gone around and changed the behavior of the power key. Now when you tap the key the whole computer goes to sleep.

I'm on a mid-2011 MB Air, so the power key is located right above the delete key. What's happened several times now is that as I've been typing, I've accidentally punched the power key instead of the delete key. Previously, this just opened up the shutdown dialog, which I could quickly close. Now with the new behavior my whole comp goes to sleep which is a huge annoyance, and I feel like punching a baby.

Is there anyway to restore the old behavior?

I googled a bit and it seems like the ""pmset powerbutton"" option no longer works...

apple,"Holy sweet Jesus... THANK YOU, Time Machine!! (a dramatization of a success story)","I just got an iMac after years of being a Linux guy -- to be fair, I still am a Linux guy, I just also have an iMac now :) -- and I'm still basically figuring out how to use OSX. Among my first challenges was transferring most of my 70 GB music library from my (currently) ext3 external hard drive to the iMac's hard drive. Luckily fuse-ext2 worked like a charm and I was able to mount the external HD as read-only. I'd been meaning to ""trim the fat"" of my music collection for a while, so I took this opportunity to only transfer what I want to keep -- which ended up being about 60 out of the 70 GB worth of music. I soon learned that a lot of folders/files would not transfer with their current filenames, which have characters with umlauts and accents and Japanese characters and stuff in them... which is weird, because the iMac doesn't seem to have problems with thusly named files in general, but I guess for whatever reason, the combination of trying to transfer files from the ext3 drive and the files having those kinds of characters was rubbing the iMac the wrong way, and it didn't want to do it. No matter... I'll just go through and rename them and transfer them, I guess. 

Anyway, to make a long story short, trimming the fat and transferring all of that music turned into about a 6 hour project and was quite arduous. In an act of sheer stupidity, I for some reason decided it would be a good idea to copy over the entire Music folder again to see if maybe the strangely named files/folders would copy this time. It asked me if I wanted to ""Replace"" the folder or ""Stop,"" and since there was no ""Merge"" option, I figured maybe that was going to be question #2 after I click Replace. So... Replace...

Aaaaand, all of my carefully curated music is gone. I quite literally turn into a rage comic and yell colorful profanities at the absolute top of my lungs, probably scaring my dog and cat half to death. Luckily my wife is out running an errand at this point. After several frantic minutes of trying to figure out if there's any way I can undo my damage, I eventually sighed and with a big frown, started over with transferring my music over again from scratch.

Before too long, I got a message saying I couldn't copy anymore files because I'm out of disk space. Hmm... light bulb! That must mean my music is still hidden somewhere in the nebulous innards of the iMac! After googling for Mac data recovery I learned that there's this thing called ""Time Machine"" that you can use for data recovery. So I checked it out, and lo and behold, I had the option to ""go back in time"" to before my blunder and have my carefully pruned music library back the way it was. Tried it and it worked! 

Ohhhh man, this is such a relief. I have to say, coming from a Linux background, I'm quite impressed with Apple right now. Clearly Time Machine is included and enabled by default in order to protect idiots like me from themselves -- and I couldn't be happier. :)",30,78,2013-11-09,AAPL,0.060137391090393066,0.9123575687408447,0.027504973113536835

apple,I may have put myself in a pickle trying to erase my Mac for resale... Please help,"I bought a new rMBP and now want to sell my old iMac. Running mavericks on a fuzion drive. I have a wireless keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and a USB mouse at my disposal. Here are the steps that lead me to where I am:

1. Boot into recovery mode using command + R
2. go into disc utility and write over free space with 0's for some security.
3. Write over used space with 0's as well.
4. Quit disc utility and go to ""install osX"" option.
5. Verifies with apple, then asked for my Apple ID and password.
7. Realize my keyboard is no longer connected so I reboot my computer thinking it might reconnect and will go into recovery mode again (after all, that's the only working thing on the whole hard drive at this point)
8. It does not do this, just boots up to apple logo for a while, then shows a 'circle with a line through it' symbol in place of the apple.

I'm sure I could boot into recovery mode again if I could just connect my keyboard over Bluetooth. But I cant connect my keyboard until I boot into recovery mode. Help?

Side note, I have my mbp and a thunderbolt cable at my disposal as well.

Thank you in advance.

apple,Not sure if a lot of you know of this but you can get more graphics memory on your HD 4000,"The HD 4000 uses your normal RAM as VRAM, so if you are willing to sacrifice some RAM you can turn it into VRAM.

As i have 16GB installed i went with 2GB of VRAM.

Disclaimer: This will not work with any dedicated graphics processors like the GeForce GT 650M, or any other Intel HD graphics processors like HD 3000 or HD 4600.

This worked for me in OS X Mavericks and i have heard of this working with Mountain Lion, i can not confirm whether or not any other version of OS X will work with this.

How to do it:

Open Terminal

Enter the following script:

&gt; sudo cp -r /System/Library/Extensions/AppleIntelFramebufferCapri.kext ~/Desktop/

It may ask you for your password if you have one.

This will copy a .kext file to your desktop, do **not** touch it.

Chose between the following VRAM sizes and copy the value of it below (Eg. 20, 40, 18)

Value|Size
:----|:----
**10** | 256MB
**18** | 384MB
**20** | 512MB
**30** | 768MB
**40** | 1024MB
**80** | 2048MB

In the following script, replace the ""??"" with the value you chose.

&gt; sudo perl -pi -e 's|\x00.{1}\x10\x07\x00\x00\x10\x07|\x00\x??\x10\x07\x00\x00\x10\x07|g' ~/Desktop/AppleIntelFramebufferCapri.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleIntelFramebufferCapri

Then paste that scrip into terminal, it may ask you for your password again.

Now [download Kext Wizzard here](http://www.osx86.net/files/file/294-kext-wizard/)

Go to [the Installation tab](http://i.imgur.com/bqaWu95.png) and drag the .kext file from your desktop into the white area. Under destination check System/Library/Extensions and for target disk chose the disk you have your OS installed on. I would also suggest checking Backup kexts that will be replaced in case something goes wrong.

Press install and wait for it to finish.

After that go into [the Maintenance tab](http://i.imgur.com/R6mXb8j.png) and check ""Rebuild Cache"" and again chose the drive you have your OS installed on.

Press execute and wait for it to finish.

Reboot your computer.

Click the Apple logo in the top left corner and about this mac, and then press more info. If everything went well it should say your target amount of VRAM next to Intel HD Graphics 4000.

Hiya all.  I don't post here talking about RES very often, but I figured this was of particular interest due to the fact that RES has been broken in Safari versions 6.1 and 7 (Mavericks) for a while now.

First and foremost: Safari users who downloaded unofficial builds to get working in 6.1/7 (a few people packaged the code from github and shipped it themselves, against my preference/wishes) - you will NOT receive this update because you're not running the official RES.  You'll need to download this manually.

Basically, Safari made some changes (not exactly sensible ones) that broke RES, and it took me some time not only to identify, evaluate and solve the problems caused, but also to get RES into a good state to push out a release.  There were lots of other bugs to fix, bits and pieces of partially finished bugfixes/code, etc.

Those things, combined with a full time job, having surgery right when Mavericks came out, etc, contributed to a much longer response time than I'm happy with - even if RES is free, etc.

So I figured since a lot of people are chomping at the bit, and Safari only checks every 24 hours, I'd let you know right away that you can go into your extensions menu and check for updates - Safari should download RES v4.3.1.

iphone,Official r/iPhone iPhone 5S Buying Guide,"###Apple iPhone 5S Buying Guide
Hello /r/iPhone! I am excited to present you with an iPhone 5S buying guide. I will make an effort to update this guide with the latest information as things come out, so that people looking for an upgrade can know our verdict on the model, accessories, warranties, and much more. Some sections might be light in useful content, but some (esp. about cases and accessories) might be information that hasn’t been found anywhere yet. I will keep going until I run out of room in the post section. I will not be commenting on anything after purchasing, so no apps or settings tips.

Please please PLEASE leave comments below with suggestions. If it is just me making this, it won’t be useful at all, but **if we all put our heads together, it can be something useful.** I will attempt to glean some reviews/tidbits from other sections.

###Should I upgrade from an…
Old Phone | General Verdict | What you would get if you did upgrade
:-----------|------------:|------------:|------------:|
iPhone 5| **NO**| touchID, slightly better camera, slightly faster processor, motion coprossesor
iPhone 4S | **MAYBE**| touchID, slightly better camera, much faster processor, motion coprossesor, Larger Screen, 4G
iPhone 4 | **YES** | touchID, HUGELY better camera, much much faster processor, motion coprossesor, Larger Screen, Siri, 4G
iPhone 3GS or Below | **DEFINITELY**| touchID, HUGELY better camera, much much much faster processor, motion coprossesor, Larger HD Screen, Siri, Apple support, iOS7, Access to thousands more apps, access to updated app content, 4G

###Size Suggestions
- **16 gb** iPhone 5S: good if you don’t keep any local media on your phone. Maybe 100hrs of music, no big apps (especially 3d games). You will be constantly deleting things to make room. Your camera alone may take up half of your space if you are an avid photographer.

- **32 gb** iPhone 5S: good for a good amount of music and media. Don’t expect more than 5 full-length movies and half of a pretty-well maintained itunes library to fit. You will probably need to search for things to remove around once every 3 months.

- **64 gb** iPhone 5S: Upload your whole music library (unless yours is crazy big). Don’t worry about size of apps. You can still easily fill this with 6 or 7 movies, or 3 or 4 HD movies.

###Color Choices for the 5S
- The first thing you should choose is **black bezel vs white bezel**. Black is more tech-y and white is more mainstream. This is hugely opinion and everyone will have their own feeling about it. *author’s note, I think white makes it look more “like an iPhone” if that is something you care about.*

- **Gold vs Silver?** They are about the same in person, especially with any cases. Don’t believe stories about the gold one being more or less in value… you will probably never realize that value and right now the two are going for about the same price anyway across the board. The news likes to pick up stories about the color of the iPhone, but different news outlets will say different ones are more popular.

- **Scratches?** This was mostly an iPhone 5 problem and there shouldn’t be dramatic scratches on any of the three colors. *authors note: would love confirmation of this*

###Where to buy

- [Apple.com](http://apple.com) - will have best time and is pretty pain-free.
- [Sprint.com](http://sprint.com)/[Verizon.com](http://verizon.com)/[At&amp;T.com](http://att.com)/whatever.com** - Will be pretty painless, but may ask you for lots of add-ons. You might have to use this if you have a grandfathered plan or a special one. *note, I have a SERO plan with sprint so I HAVE to use the web site!*
- Over the phone - not recommended. They will keep asking you for warranties cases etc. If you do go over the phone, use [gethuman.com](http://gethuman.com/) to find the number straight to a human ASAP.
- In a store/kiosk - not recommended. Usually low supply, long waits, or incompetent people. They will also try to upsell you, for things that you can buy online for much cheaper. HOWEVER, jump on promotions where they give free stuff with a phone.
- Ebay - This is a great way to get a phone off-contract. Might be impossible to get a warranty though.
- Craigslist - Your phone will be stolen. Or too expensive. Good luck.

###Warranty

Plan Type | AppleCare+    |  No Warranty | Squaretrade  | Carrier (for 2 years coverage) [sprint]
:-----------|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|
Initial Cost        |       $99 (or $65 on ebay)|  Free   | $124 (sometimes coupons available to $88) | $216 
Replacement Cost (Accidental Damage)|    $79 (max 2)|   $269| $99 | $200
Replacement Cost (Manufacturer defect 1st year)|        Free|   Free | Free | Free
Replacement Cost (Manufacturer defect 2nd year)|        Free|   $269 | $99 | $200
Additional Information | Geniuses seem likely to give you a break | Geniuses seem reluctant to offer extra help | Geniuses seem reluctant to offer extra help - kinda a hassle Get free Case! | Super Hassle
Coverage in loss or theft |None|None| None | Covered with $200 deductible
**Total** (0 breaks) | $99| **FREE** | $124 | $216
**Total** (1 break) | **$178** | $269 | $223 | $416
**Total** (2 breaks) | **$257** | $538 | $322 | $616
**Total** (3 breaks) | $526 | $807 | **$421** | $816
**Total** (4 breaks) | $795 | $1076 | **$520** | $1016
**Total** (0 breaks, 1 defect second year) | **$99** | $269 | $223 | $416
**Total** (1 break, 1 defect. second year) | **$178** | $538 | $322 | $616
**Total** (2 breaks, 1 defect. second year) | **$257** | $807 | $421 | $816
**Total** (3 breaks, 1 defect. second year) | **$526** | $1076 | **$520** | $1016
**Total w/ one loss** (assuming 32gb) |   $848 |  $749 |  $873 | **$416**
**Total w/ one loss 1 break** (32gb) | $927 | $1018|$972|**$616**

- **Verdict**: Try to guess the number of breaks and losses that your iPhone will suffer. Both plans are better than no plan at 1 break (second year or accidental) and Squaretrade pulls ahead at 3 breaks. With one defect, Squaretrade and Applecare+ are even at 3 breaks 1 defect. With one loss, carrier warranty is most profitable.

###Cases

- **Charging Case**
&gt;- [monoprice](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=112&amp;cp_id=11213&amp;cs_id=1120111&amp;p_id=10572&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2) ~$40
&gt;- [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/MFI-Apple-Approved-Rechargeable-Additional/dp/B0099SG2WE/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384442948&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=mfi+charger) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Certified-Battery-Smartphone-T-Mobile-Verizon/dp/B00EQGW4X0/ref=sr_1_14?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384442948&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mfi+charger), $62 and $49.
&gt;- All of these cases add a ton of bulk, should protect the phone well, should extend the battary life, won't dock no matter what.

- **Wallet Case**
&gt;- Please suggest in comments.
&gt;- [Speck](http://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-SmartFlex-Card-iPhone/dp/B0093IHYRC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384443116&amp;sr=1-1) Looks nice. ($40)

- **Slim Case** 
&gt;- Someone suggested [this one](http://www.caudabe.com/collections/iphone-5-accessories/products/the-veil-frost) but it's sold out. $15. seems similar to monoprice cases.
&gt;- Check monoprice. Should be able to get a minimal case for ~$5.

- **Tough Case**
&gt;- adds a ton of bulk but should help vs a variety of things.
&gt;- [lifeproof](http://www.lifeproof.com/en/iphone-5s-fre) $55. Adds lots of bulk, waterproof + dropproof, doesn't work with many accessories.
&gt;- Otterbox Defender - please add review/link in comments
&gt;- [Spigen Armor](http://www.amazon.com/SPIGEN-SGP-SGP10490-Tough-iPhone/dp/B00DMKGPP4/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384443213&amp;sr=1-4) I have heard many positive reviews of this one.

###Docking Station

- There are currently no speaker or alarm clock docking stations that allow you to dock with a case with no modifications.
- [This](http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-mini-brushed-Designed-Lightning/dp/B00E3ALGVA/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) dock should work with cases, but it's a little pricey and you need to include your own cable.
- There are currently no MFi docking stations (that come with the cable)
- If you have an iPhone 5 and are docking it, please leave a comment with your solution.

###Car Charger

- Just make sure it is at least 2.1v, you will have to provide your own cable (or get one that is MFi certified!) I like the anker brand name, so I say go with [This one](http://www.amazon.com/Anker%C2%AE-Charger-iPhone-Samsung-Motorola/product-reviews/B00D82O68Y/ref=sr_1_1_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1). It's also the highest ranked car charger for iphone 5 on amazon.

###Additional Cables

- [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Lightning-Compatible-Cable-Meter/dp/B009SYZ8OC) work well and come in three different sizes. The connector to the iphone is a bit thicker than apple so depending on the case, you might have to remove the case. **$13.99** (many sizes)

- [Apple](http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Lightning-to-USB-Cable/dp/B0097BEFYA/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384398866&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=lightning+cable) should work fine. Expensive-ish though, but they will definitely work forever... even warrantied by apple. **$17.99**

- [Monoprice](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=112&amp;cp_id=11213&amp;cs_id=1083101&amp;p_id=10026&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2) Should work fine. Might be the cheapest out of the lot of them. **$9.42**

- [Third Party](http://dx.com/p/usb-sync-data-charging-lightning-cable-for-iphone-5-white-100cm-163395) almost definitely won't work normally, the iphone will reject them and not charge. **$2.99**
&gt;- Possible Workaround —
&gt;- Turn on USB power/Wall Outlet power
&gt;- Plug in lightning cable to iPhone
&gt;- Dismiss any warnings
&gt;- Unlock your iPhone.
&gt;- Dismiss any remaining warnings.
&gt;- Now with the screen turned on.
&gt;- Unplug the knock off lightning cable.
&gt;- Plug it back in.
&gt;- Dismiss warning again
&gt;- It should now charge.
&gt;- Enjoy!

###Planned Sections
- Screen Protectors (Lots of people don’t use one. I don’t know much, but people like Power support and I have heard good things about the SPIGEN SGP oleophobic one. I use monoprice ($1.50!)

- Maybe 5S vs 5C guide? I feel like people have mostly made up their mind about this before they consider much more.

ipad,Kindness and my iPad,"So, I thought I would share with y'all my little story.

I was at the bar back in April. I had brought my iPad with me like normal. But I ended up talking with one of my friends, who happens to be blind.

Things are going well. Several subjects of discussion came up. Unfortunately time passed by and I had to jet.  Well, my friend needed a ride as cabs are stupid pricey.

Gather my things and lead him to my vehicle and take him home. We get there and I guided him to the door and gave him his things. Apparently, I either left my iPad on the roof of my truck or gave it to my friend.

Either way, I am out an iPad. Detrimental and I hadn't left it locked, nor put much security on it... So, saddened me changed all my passwords and what not. 

But about a month ago someone sent an email saying they have it. I don't check my email much, so I didn't see it until earlier this week. Called the people who had it. They said it's still here and that they hadn't touched it since.

apple,"As of iOS 7.0.4, aftermarket Lightning cables do NOT work...","I recently updated my 5 to iOS 7.0.4. Before that, the cheap aftermarket cables I bought on eBay worked fine, I would just sometimes get an error saying this device is unsupported. Usually I could unplug it and plug back in and it would charge fine. Now, when I plug it in, nothing happens.

I also tried this on our iPad Mini Retina, same thing. It came out of the box with 7.0.3 and it at least signaled that the cord was plugged in, although it did not charge. Updated to 7.0.4, same behavior. Guess I gotta break down and buy a new Lightning cable from Apple. Are they still doing the trade in thing with unauthorized cables?

TL:DR - if you have cheap no-name aftermarket Lightning cables, and update to 7.0.4, say bye bye.

apple,Can someone tell me why this worked?,"So a little background, I bought a new 4s in August. It was cheap and I had been curious about trying an iphone for a while after being a long term android user. I updated my iOS to the 7.0.2 and lost my wifi immediately. The toggle was greyed out and I went through the usual fixes (reset network settings, restart, restart in airplane mode, full restore, whatever else I could fin on the Apple help page) and nothing worked. The Apple tech support online told me to take it to a store or authorized repair place to get it looked at, but I'm in a small town in China right now and the closest one to me pretty far and would require an overnight trip. Thats not going to be possible for a few weeks but I need the Wifi. 

So I hit youtube and found this insane sounding tip to use a blow dryer on the back of the phone until it gives the overheating warning and then shut it off and let it cool down for a while. I wouldn't normally do something so stupid but I was desperate and I had a back up old android in case i fucked it up.

Well, I tried it and it worked. Wifi is totally back and I've restarted a few times just to see if it sticks. What happened there? Why did 7.0.2 kill my wifi and why did heat fix it??

iphone,My stolen iPhone/Find My iPhone success story,"So I've posted here a couple of times about my stolen phone and gotten some good advice so I thought I'd just post here, not that anyone will care, about my success and a big thanks to Apple

So on Halloween night I lost my iPhone and someone found it and decided to keep it. I tracked it to an apartment complex nearby and then it died and showed up only one more time on Find My iPhone for a split second.

So I had given up and was in the process of buying a 5S on eBay (another whole story, the guy never shipped, I got my money back) but for the most part I was without a phone since Halloween

When I realized someone had stolen it, I filed a police report. I had zero hope of getting it back but hoped maybe someone got arrested with it on them

This past Saturday night, I get a phone call from my roommate. I had plugged her number in on Find My iPhone as the number to call if it was found. Well someone had bought it on Craigslist nearby and when they plugged their SIM card in, it popped up saying to call that number. Mr. Good Samaritan called! We met at the police HQ on Saturday night and he brought it and I got it back after signing some release forms!

It was good enough that this guy of all people bought it but what was great is iOS7 not allowing the guy who stole it to wipe it clean or anything. It was essentially a brick because he had to have my iCloud login. So today I went to the AT&amp;T store, got a new SIM card and got all my information back. It really is a miracle.

TL;DR: good samaritan called me when he realized he bought my stolen phone thanks to Find My iPhone, got phone back in the exact same condition as I had it stolen from me 3 weeks earlier",50,218,2013-11-18,AAPL,0.09820173680782318,0.868245005607605,0.03355329856276512

iphone,iOS 7.1 beta 1 CONSIDERABLY increases iPhone 4 performance on home screen animations. I'll be looking around the OS for more performance enhancements.,"The animations feel much quicker as well. Dark colors and dark keyboard are also nice.

EDIT: It's starting to get a little worse. I am guessing that is because I have more background processes going on now. I can say that it is still an improvement over 7.0.4. The black dock and black keyboard are making me really like this release.

Bold text kind of looks like it is enabled in some places and not in some places. But maybe that's just me.

I'd post pics and such but I don't have alien blue pro. You can find some over the inter webs anyways.

Long story short, I'm a first year teacher at a fairly rough school through a Teach for America placement. I teach special education and carry around my personal iPad so that I can take notes for the students I work with while in their general education classroom. Well, today it went missing from my bag at the start of school. I initially figured that due to my sleep deprivation, I must have left it at home. However, when I got home it wasn't there either so I'm now certain it was stolen. While at school, as a precaution, I reported it as lost on FindMyiPhone, but it's WiFi only and it's already protected with a passcode. I've already contacted administration at my school and they are going to work with the police from an administrative standpoint. What else can I do though? I guess I'm a little naïve about these kinds of things.

While we were preparing for the [imminent release of Procreate 2.0](http://procreate.si/forums/index.php?topic=2557.0), we realised we still had a load of promo codes that'll get wiped once the update comes out. So, we've made a [spreadsheet with all 75 remaining codes available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As9z8oeBw7KCdEhPdDhhTEE2YWw4VUZob1pGUUVnbkE&amp;usp=sharing).

All we ask is that you leave an ""x"" next to the code you take, so we can all keep track of what's still available. 

Also, if you so feel inclined to show us some love in return, a drawing of Sir Patrick Stewart in any style, shape, from or quality would be a real treat.

Happy procreating!

Here are my games (best games are listed first):

1. [SimpleRockets](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplerockets/id663068211?ls=1&amp;mt=8) - Build rocket ships with realistic physics and explore the solar system.

1. [SimplePhysics](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplephysics/id408233979?ls=1&amp;mt=8) - Design everything from tree houses to ferris wheels and then simulate your design with a realistic physics engine.

1. [Dummy Defense](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dummy-defense/id460832678?ls=1&amp;mt=8) - Protect your dummy from explosions, boulders, spiked walls, and more (using realistic physics, of course!)

1. [Santa's Engineer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/santas-engineer/id465563485?ls=1&amp;mt=8) - Help Santa build some stuff at the north pole! Your designs are then simulated with realistic physics.

1. [BridgeBasher](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bridgebasher/id324473106?ls=1&amp;mt=8) - Design a bridge and then destroy it. Oh, if you had not guessed, this one has realistic physics too.

1. [Skyword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skyword/id311852130?ls=1&amp;mt=8) - Word puzzle game that actually does NOT use realistic physics. It's a terrible game, but it was my first one, so go easy on me!

apple,MEGA iOS app released! 50GB free encrypted storage space on your iPhone!,"So https://mega.co.nz/ just released their iOS app earlier today, and I quite like it so far.

It gives you 50GB free storage space (all encrypted too), the site is based outside the US (New Zealand), along with their servers, so if you don't want the NSA snooping around in your files, well this is a great service for you!

[Here](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/11/27/kim-dotcoms-cloud-storage-service-mega-now-ios-app/?fromcat=all), [here](http://www.macmurmur.com/2013/11/27/mega-cloud-drive-ios/) and [here](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Download-MEGA-iOS-App-403877.shtml) are some professional reviews of the app for those who want a better explanation than I can give.

It's basicly like Dropbox, and offers the same features.

Here's the app for the curious:

Important note, I am in no way responsible for this wonderful hack. All credit goes to user Tiamo on Macrumors forums, he accepts Paypal donations for everyone who would like to buy him a beer (info on link bellow)


First and second generation of Mac Pro's (Macpro1,1 and Macpro2,1) have 32bit EFI and because of that since Mac OS 10.7 Lion there was no easy way of installing higher versions of Mac OS on them. Then ML Post Factor came and enabled installation of Mac OS 10.8 on unsupported, legacy Intel Mac's. The same guys are currently making MacPostFactor for Mavericks, but until it's out, here's copy/paste of a guide from Macrumors, together with links bellow! It works great, i'm typing from my Mac Pro 1,1 (firmware hacked to 2,1 gen) running Mac OS 10.9 Mavericks!


Guide is bellow, my advice is that you MUST use guide bellow for creating Mavericks installation USB. Do not use automated Lion Disk Makers, it will not work (Lion disk maker is great, but it won't be good in this particular scenario!). Good luck!

Copy / paste:

1. following those steps to make an install drive - http://www.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/how-to-create-an-os-x-mavericks-install-drive/

2. replace boot.efi - boot.efi can be found at System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi and usr/standalone/i386/boot.efi

3. insert your board-id into OSInstall.mpkg(please google it)

4. insert your board-id into InstallableMachine.plist(please google it)

5. reboot from the usb drive.

===================
this is a native efi32 bootloader, instead of a CSM loader
it built a thunk between EFI64 and EFI32, forwarding EFI64 call from kernel to EFI32 firmware.
so those programs using EFI runtime services, such as bless, nvram will be run without any problem.

this is a full version bootloader, hibernation, filevault2 are also supported out of box.
