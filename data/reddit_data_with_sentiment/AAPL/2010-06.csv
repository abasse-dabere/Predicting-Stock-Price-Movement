apple,"Alien Blue (Reddit Client for iPhone) gets a completely new interface, and I would love your feedback.","TL/DR : Alien Blue gets a facelift. [See it in action.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOxkgXJJ48)

Hi folks, Alien Blue was [announced last Friday](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/c96pq/alien_blue_open_source_reddit_client_alternative/), and I received a tonne of feedback about the UI.  I busily went to work, and re-wrote the **entire front-end** to be more consistent with the iPhone User Interface Guidelines and far more intuitive (inline with what you love about iReddit).

The new look also features the familiar **Reddit colors** (including the upvote / downvote colors).  Initially, I wanted to distance Alien Blue from iReddit, but they've really done a good job with the flow of the app.  Alien Blue now utilises the same flow.

Redditor **barelythere** was kind enough to draw up some mock-ups of how the interface could be improved, as I understand, the look and feel is inspired from the **Twitter app**.  After 3 days of continual (read: sleepless) development, I want to show you what the new Alien Blue (v1.0.2) looks like:

**Here's a video showing the new user interface:**

**I would love your feedback on this new interface.**

The new version hasn't been submitted to Apple yet, as I'm still waiting for them to approve v1.0.1, but I will be making further refinements to the design with your suggestions.

The following changes to the interface were also made thanks to all of your feedback:

* Now have the option to pick ""What's Hot"", ""New"", ""Controversial"" and ""Top""
* Picking subreddits is now very much like iReddit, but with the added option to show ""**My Submissions**""
* Entire re-write of the Messages section for ultra-fast scrolling, and consistent look and feel.  The Messages section also includes **My Comments** so that you can track your replies to various posts.
* Internal Reddit links (like /r/bestof posts) are now processed with Alien Blue (rather than the web browser)
* The location of vote up/down icons are reversed.  Up-votes are seemingly more frequent, and are now easier to press as they are located toward the hard edge of the screen.
* New comments / message replies can now be written in a nice large text area (with a **Return Key** - what was I thinking??)
* Stopping the scroll was resulting in a *click*.  The app now avoids these **accidental taps** while you scroll.
* Disabled **upside-down** rotation.

If you have experience with the development for the App Store, I would also like to pick your brain about something:  Alien Blue v1.0.1 has been ""In Review"" for over a week now.  In your experience, should I wait for v1.0.1 to approved first, or should I go ahead and replace the binary with the new one.  Will this piss off the App Store reviewers, and cause even longer delays?

** EDIT: ** There's been a flood of requests for beta testing.  Personally, I can't wait for you guys to use this, so if you're an iPhone Dev and can't wait for the App Store, you can shoot me an email to support@alienblue.org for Adhoc distribution.  I've not done Adhoc before, so please be patient while I set it up in Xcode (... everything takes a little longer when my baby daughter tries to pull the cables out of the wall).

** EDIT 2 : ** This is what the app looks like with even more **compact margins and font-size**.  It's a bit small for me, but my eyes have taken a lot of abuse from CRT monitors:

apple,You are less likely to kill yourself working at Foxconn than at Wal-Mart....,"Some numbers to show just why [these Foxconn suicides](http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/06/01/china.foxconn.inside.factory/index.html?iref=allsearch) shouldn't be considered newsworthy:

**Foxconn Factories in China:**

Population: ≈300,000

Suicide rate for total population: 10 per 6 months, 20 per year (est.)

Suicides per 100,000 people per year: 20/3 ≈ 7

**International suicide rates per 100,000 people annually:**

Russia: [≈41](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+russia),
Latvia: [≈30](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+latvia),
Japan: [≈25](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+japan),
China: [≈21](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+china),
France: [≈16](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+france),
Global: [≈13](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicide+rate+global),
USA: [≈10](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+USA),
UK: [≈8](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+UK),
Italy: [≈7](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=suicides+in+italy),
Foxconn Factories: ≈7


**Some more numbers:**

≈[1 Million iPads sold in America in 28 days](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/291508),
≈[1 Million Wal-Mart Employees in America](http://www.ufcw.org/take_action/walmart_workers_campaign_info/facts_and_figures/walmartgeneralinfo.cfm),
≈[2 Million People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food) in the American Food Service Industry

**In other words: **

Foxconn factory workers are about as likely to commit suicide as an Italian. They are three times less likely to off themselves than the average Chinese citizen and about two times less likely than the average human. 

100 iPad early adopters, 100 Wal-Mart Employees and 200 Food Service workers should be expected to commit suicide in America this year.

**Bottom line:**

One is less likely to kill themselves  if they work and live at a Foxconn Factory than if they work and live almost anywhere else.",26,18,2010-06-02,AAPL,0.19182994961738586,0.7854957580566406,0.02267422154545784

apple,A question about Macbook's reliability.,"Im college right now, gonna need a laptop soon and i am leaning heavily towards a Macbook/Macbook Pro (if i can argue it to my parents, they have the cash). Im very scared though, as Macs ARE a big expense, and i dont want it to be broken in a span of a few months after buying the thing (obviously) or something inside explode or something, so my question is, is the reliability and the stability (physical and software-wise) of a Macbook/Macbook Pro good enough, out of the box, to last me a good deal of time (say 3-4 years)? I dont expect it to be perfect that it'll last 3-4 years, but will it live long enough, out of the box, to last a year even?

______

TL;DR: 
As a long run expense, is a Macbook/Pro reliable and stable enough (expecting the obvious things that can happen to a laptop in 2-3 years). As a ""short run"" expense, will a Macbook/Pro remain stable and reliable enough to go on without problems for 6months-1year?

apple,Macbook Vs Water. (crosspost from machelp because I'm not sure where to post this),"Last night my wife dropped a full pint of water on her 2 year old macbook. Apparently it shut down immediately and she had the presence of mind to remove the battery (it's in a bag of rice like a wet phone for now). I came home and gently wafted a hairdryer over it for 45 mins, plugged it in and got the startup chime and then.... dead laptop. Twice. Then I figured if I try to turn it on and there's water in it then maybe I could cause an electrical short.

As you can probably tell, I'm a mac user and therefore unused to going inside my computers but if I have to, I will. I'm working on the assumption that the laptop is toast but if any of you can offer any tips to try of point me at a tutorial then I'd be very, very grateful indeed. Anybody know a repair shop in San Francisco, maybe?

My wife is really being hard on herself about this as we're pretty broke, can't afford a new one and she starts at grad school this year. She'd feel a lot better about herself if I could at least try to fix it. All help and advice very gratefully accepted.",42,5,2010-06-06,AAPL,0.05653480812907219,0.9009302854537964,0.042534857988357544

apple,I called Apple recently about my girlfriend's malfunctioning macbook.  It's 4 years old and she never bought AppleCare.

We had a personal agent through the whole process and a direct number to reach them at.

Edit:  I should also clarify the title of this post.  When I said ""This is one reason we buy their products"" I literally meant myself and my girlfriend.

apple,Question:  Safari Extensions keep disappearing,"I enabled the Develop menu and then enabled extensions (using Safari on an iMac running Snow Leopard).

I then installed a few extensions (Adblock, Instapaper for Safari) and all was running beautifully.

This morning when I booted up, the extensions were gone.  Develop menu was still there, and extensions were still enabled.  But the extensions had disappeared from Extensions window.  I reinstalled them, then rebooted and again - they were gone.

Not sure what I'm doing wrong - I download the extensions, double click and get the ""Do you want to install this extension"" message, I click on ""Install"" and the extension file itself disappears (presumably it's imported into Safari's file folders?) and the relevant button appears on Safari's toolbar.  But then with a reboot it's all gone.

Having no problems on my work PC - the extensions are all here this morning, as installed yesterday.

Any ideas as to what I might be doing wrong?

After doing some searching I found that Snow Leopard was only $35!

I went into the apple store and the guy tells me that I have to buy the $200 pack with iLife and iWork, because I am coming from Tiger and not a previous Leopard install. He also said he wouldn't help me find a tiger install cd to replace my seemingly defective one.

Now... I've found many people on the net saying that the only difference is that if I get the $35 upgrade disk, while I can install Snow Leopard onto a clean drive I do not get iWork/iLife and well... the whole operation is *unethical*.

If it's just a matter of ethics, I'll do it.

**TL;DR**  My Tiger installation disc isn't working. The in-store apple guy was a dick and wouldn't help me replace my disc. So I want to buy the $35 Snow Leopard option. From a blank Intel MacBookPro... will it give me Snow Leopard?

mac,why i will only buy a mac.,"I walked into a coffee shop near campus recently and counted the laptops. 9 out of 14 were apples of some kind or another, mostly new macbook pro's. admittedly, i was embarrassed to be #10, since so many apple users, who are semi-pro internet surfers and don't take advantage of the machine itself, let alone the OS (myself included), cave in to an image.
but i must admit, if you want to know why i will never buy any other machine, hear this:

I used to love my sony vaio. i work my laptops to the bone, and in 2006 during midterms, it died. i called sony and they said to replace the parts would be about the price of buying a new vaio. so, my tech-savvy (geek) friends bore down on me to invest in a $1200 macbook, despite being pc-users for the most part. i paid $250 for the extended warranty just in case, and it was one of the best decisions i'd made as a professional student, 2nd only to buying a mac. this will become clear in a minute.
now this mac and me were like twins. i do EVERYTHING with it. Programming, Web-design, Flash, and a myriad of other skills i thought would make my purchase worthwhile. i went through 2 screens (one paid for by apple, which NO manufacturer will do), cd drive, airport cards, keyboards, power chords. god damn, i was brutal on it. each time i sent it off to apple and had it back in 3 days tops.
in the meantime, my wife's sister bought a new toshiba that had a problem with the speakers. i called them, and after so many excuses for why they would not touch it (still under toshiba's warranty, mind you) the last communication with toshiba went like this:
toshiba - ""because your computer was purchased in singapore, i.e. internationally, we cannot honor the warranty.""
me - ""I'VE NEVER BEEN TO SINGAPORE!!!"" it was purchased in  indiana.""
toshiba - well, the wholesaler (best buy) bought it in singapore"".
click

finally best buy piped in and said they would replace the computer because it had been repaired 3 times (cf. no lemon law). but they didn't make that model anymore, so they said they would give her one of equal or LESS value and she had to BUY a new warranty. (this part is important).

back to my butchered mac. i REALLY beat the hell out of that thing. my warranty expired on October 23, 2009 so i called two days prior to resolve a flickering screen issue i had noticed (probably from all the times i slammed the lid shut or replaced the screen).
i sent it in, they sent it back, but the issue was not resolved. i called them 2 weeks later (after the warranty expired) and the conversation with Apple this time went something like this:

Apple - ""Mr. Anderson, it seems your computer has had 3 major operations in the past year.""

(at this point i'm thinking, oh shit, they won't repair it because i've been a bad boy and the warranty had expired, typical customer service i've experienced elsewhere. ""even Apple has a 'screw you' policy"" , i thought.
Apple - ""we are very sorry for the inconvenience""
me - ""here it comes..."" i thought.
Apple - we can offer to try to repair it again, but at this point, it is more expensive for us to repair it than replace it.
me - okay
Apple - we would like to GIVE you a new macbook with the same specs. unfortunately we stopped making that model, so we must GIVE you a new macbook.

3. Right click this device and choose ""Use this device for sound output""
4. Run the AU Lab application in Developer/Application/Audio
5. Choose next (you should already have an output denoted by a red box).
6. Click add input and then click next
7. For the audio device drop down menu, choose the audio device you previously created with the Audio MIDI Setup program
8. At the output channels tab, drag the red box from SoundFlower Ouput Stream #1 to stream 2.

It stops loading pages.","I've reinstalled it so many times, uninstalled add-ons, updated/changed flash settings and reinstalled/updated all sorts of stuff, but it still keeps just doing the same old thing: it stops loading the pages. It just stops working.

It's okay for a week or so and then it goes again: not fully loading the pages, sometimes not even loading the freaking new tab page. 

It feels like the browser just gives up doing whatever it is doing in the middle of the activity. What the hell is going on? I really like firefox and I want to use it on mac, but this shit is getting so ridiculously annoying that I've since had to switch my default browser.

Last time it did this I just left it like that and moved to Chrome, then it randomly started working again a month later and now it's broken once again, without me changing any settings, installing any add-ons or doing anything at all, it just stops working all by itself. It's so odd.

iphone,Alien Blue v1.0.3 (Reddit Client for iPhone) is now available on the App Store!,"tl/dr: You can grab it from [here](http://itunes.apple.com/app/alien-blue-unofficial-reddit/id370144106?mt=8).

Apple approved v1.0.3 today, and here's what's new:

* Seamless One-Tap **Camera &gt; Imgur &gt; Reddit** Integration in Posts/Comments (Gonewild is going to go wild).  **It is now the fastest way to get your images onto Reddit.** It will allow you to crop and scale before submitting, so fear not.
* Multitasking support for iOS4
* Multiple / Novelty Account Support (also handy if you share a mobile device with another Redditor).
* Auto-Save while Commenting and Posting
* Added support for ""Read It Later""
* Ability to remove/manage your Imgur uploads (just incase you upload something you shouldn't have.)
* Added Top / New / Best / Old / Controversial sorting to Comments (from the ellipsis button)
* Added Casual Subreddits : for reddits that you don't want to officially subscribe to but like to visit ;)

Improvements / Fixes:

* Support for iOS4
* Swipe on posts is now easier to active. 

** NOTE:** There is currently a bug that makes it **less responsive** to very quick swipes (**slow swiping** works fine).  Sorry about this, I'll have a patch for the next release.

* Deeper threading (utilises arrows once threads reach five levels deep)
* Enter Fullscreen mode from any view (rather than only posts)
* Fullscreen expanded to utilise the Status Bar area
* Night-Mode now extends to creating comments, and creating posts.
* Reply/comment section adheres to your text-size selection
* Save state now functional in Internal Browser also
* Fixed hard to press Cancel button on Browser options
* Fixed password field in Instapaper settings
* Fixed Instapaper logins with special characters
* Reply/comment area no longer bounces (making it easier to scroll through your comment)
* Fixed Inbox, Sent, Comments segment bunching after landscape rotation
* Improved memory management when viewing inline images.
* Tightened up margins in comments and posts list
* Reduced contrast of brighter elements in Night-Mode
* Fixed issue with incorrect score calculations

I haven't been able to put all of the changes/fixes I wanted in this release, but I prefer to get incremental updates to you regularly rather than once every few months.  If you haven't seen your suggestions and fixes in this release, please don't worry.  It's on its way.  At present, I have **240 items** on the Alien Blue TODO list and I will be working on each and every one.

If you would like to know what's coming up in **1.0.4**, here's a short list:

* Performance updates (especially under iOS4 where it is currently struggling).
* Updated comment entry that lets you see what you are responding to while you type.
* A lot of UI polish
* iOS4 background notifications on new messages
* Improved performance on Subreddit and Settings screens
* Option to lock Alien Blue with a password (for those of you with nosy spouses or kids)
* View All Reddits option
* Specify ""All Time"", ""This Month"" etc. when viewing posts
* ... and a lot more...

There's a span of new UI changes and functionality on their way.  My iPad is set to arrive in the next two weeks, and **full iPad support** will be coming very shortly after.  The ability to **search** is also on the roadmap, as I feel this is a critical part of Reddit that is currently missing in Alien Blue.",102,122,2010-06-19,AAPL,0.05565210059285164,0.9095324873924255,0.03481538966298103

iphone,My iPad just arrived!  Alien Blue for iPad is on its way...,"Hi everyone,

The delivery man had an exciting present for me this morning.  I know that a lot of you have iPads and would like Alien Blue's features on the larger screen.  Thanks to your encouragement, I had ordered an iPad to begin **true** iPad support for Alien Blue.

The device is now in my hands, and Alien Blue for the iPad is coming very shortly.

I've got approximately **50 modifications** and todo items planned for the iPad version, and I will be rolling them out with each release.  I don't want to risk underwhelming you guys, but I prefer to roll features out frequently and incrementally rather than once every couple of months.  This also lets me get feedback from you more frequently, so that the application can benefit from your suggestions.

I will be developing both versions from the same code base so that performance optimisations and fixes are pushed to both platforms.

I will be devoting as much at attention to both.  The iPhone version still has a long way to go, and there will be no momentum lost on either platform.

There are some really exciting features coming to both the iPad and iPhone versions of Alien Blue.  I will keep you all posted on /r/iphone, so that I can integrate your feedback as I go along.

**UPDATE:** I thought this thing was going to be a giant iPhone, but it's amazing!  I don't mean to be graphic, but that was one of the most pleasant bathroom experiences ever.",57,110,2010-06-23,AAPL,0.026856252923607826,0.9243791103363037,0.048764679580926895

apple,iPhone 4 Sensitivity to Fingers Explained by a Ph.D. in Electromagnetics,"The technical explanation for the variation in signal strength found when closing the iPhone's case gaps with one's fingers is, that the antennas are being ""loaded"".  The loading from fingers, a material with a high relative permittivity of ~50 at 2 GHz, changes the input impedance and resonant frequency of the antenna resulting in loss.

If I had to take an educated guess, I suspect pressing one's fingers across the gap increases the gap capacitance and changes the feed input impedance and electrical length of the antenna.  It is analogous to holding on to a piano wire with two fingers while it is being struck.  Its resonant frequency will shift and its quality factor will drop, resulting in a sound that is off key and muffled.

A solution often employed in the field is to preload an antenna.  Preloading is including a large permittivity in the design, so when a human puts it close to their body, there isn't a significant change.  The down side of this is that it often reduces bandwidth and efficiency.  So you can either have a great antenna that takes a hit when your fingers are near it or have one that is not quite as good but never changes.  Isn't it like Apple to choose the former and like the masses to cry for the latter?  ;)

Note that if the antennas were designed to be inside the case as opposed to being part of it, they would likely have a loss somewhere between the best (unloaded) and worst (loaded) performance of the existing antenna.  It's all an engineering tradeoff.

The best solution is to not touch the antennas at the gap (Steve is right) or to buy a phone cover that keeps your high-permittivity sausages away from the RF sensitive areas.  Apple made the trade off for you and in my opinion it is a novel and good one, provided it can survive the bad PR generated by the griping gap grippers.",234,290,2010-06-25,AAPL,0.07093959301710129,0.8990663290023804,0.02999407984316349

iphone,Alien Blue icon suggestions.  Let's discuss it!,"Hi Everyone,

As Alien Blue takes up icon real estate on many of your devices, I wanted to open up the forum and get some ideas / improvements for the icon.  Your feedback has been the backbone of Alien Blue, so why not the artwork that accompanies it.

The Alien Blue icon is currently a **/r/ in a speech bubble**, and although some people don't mind it, other's feel it could be much better.

I have zero ego about these things, and am really open to changing it to be inline with what you find appealing.

**Reddit Alien** : The use of the alien in the logo would have been ideal, **but** it would infringe on Conde Nast's (Advance Magazine Publishers) trademark.  This is understandable, Reddit admins (and Conde Nast) have spent considerable time and money giving meaning to our little white alien friend.  It would be unethical for me to piggy back using their brand.  It would also be a violation of the App Store approval process, Apple is very clear about this.

**Memes** : Other suggestions that people have sent through over email are the use of Reddit memes (like Narwhals and Bacon).  I would **really** prefer to avoid this.  Many long time Redditors (like myself) have mixed feelings about these memes and my concern is that this will make the application seem like a novelty.

Keeping these things in mind, I am all ears.

** Existing Artwork **

If anybody wants to play around with the existing logo, I have uploaded the vector and PSD of the artwork [here](http://alienblue.org/artwork/alien-blue-vector-and-psd.zip).

Another redditor was even kind enough to prepare [these](http://imgur.com/x8v9m.png).

iphone,AT&amp;T - please stop shipping me extra iPhones,"On the day of presale I tried the AT&amp;T web store numerous times with no success.... So at 10am I preordered two (my wife and I) at the local AT&amp;T shop.

I've been enjoying my iPhone (except for a 3GS jailbreak / restore issue) ever since picking it up on the 24th at the local AT&amp;T shop where I ordered it.

Yesterday, FedEx dropped off TWO MORE iPhones at my door - I was charged for these too.  Today, I'm receiving emails that my orders have been delayed and they are working as fast as possible.

Turns out that the failed web site attempts really did go through even though the sites did not indicate so.

Anyone else having this problem?
Friends have told me to ebay them for much more than the 2yr contract price, but I'm afraid AT&amp;T will eventually catch up to me and see I was sold 4 iPhones at the upgrade discount (instead of two).

apple,Q: How are iOS4 and Mac OS X interrelated?,"The impression i've had is that iPhone/iPad software was the same OS, now iOS4, which is itself a subset of Mac OS X.

In fact, I remember earlier versions of the iPhone OS reported as being a lean but full Mac OS X install.

Does anyone know? And if it is the same OS, why couldn't we run iOS4 on iPads today?",21,27,2010-06-29,AAPL,0.03498421609401703,0.9276054501533508,0.03741035982966423

iphone,Gizmodo prototype was in a case.  Hmmm...,The Apple employee that lost the iPhone 4 prototype had the phone in a case.  Everyone decided the case was there to disguise the new phone so it wouldn't attract attention.  I wonder if Apple did most of their field testing with the phones in cases like this.  Maybe they set themselves up for this reception problem by not testing the phone without one.,12,14,2010-06-30,AAPL,0.12807756662368774,0.8222718238830566,0.04965059459209442
