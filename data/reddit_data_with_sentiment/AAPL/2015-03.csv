------------------

Hey folks,

I took a lot of time to create this today, because I am very curious about what the collective responses will be to these questions a week out from Apple's big Watch event on March 9th.

**[Here is the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/168ulGBIEGnQRvNMqHz6nrk9UJJjiLL6iTx0lLu7Eaw0/viewform?usp=send_form)**

**Thank you**

If this gets any traction at all (more than 50 responses maybe), I will be creating another very similar survey a week *after* Apple's event.  I may also create a quick one on the day of the event for basic reactions.

The survey I make two weeks from now would be much more focused around what version people will be interested in buying. 

*I really, really appreciate any up-votes for visibility, as well as anyone who takes the time to respond. Thank you!*",115,79,2015-03-02,AAPL,0.021097099408507347,0.9101135730743408,0.06878931075334549

I'm bitterly disappointed that Outlook 2016 seems to be a reskinned version of the existing pile of garbage. Still no delayed send, still no ability to ""mute"" email threads.

Word seems to be using 90-100% CPU nonstop. I assume we can chalk that up to this being a beta.

PowerPoint seems to have improved considerably. Much easier to scroll through the slides, no non-stop draw-in, and rearranging slides is easier.

Excel has smooth scrolling. I could almost cry.

Evernote is still better than OneNote, but that's just one man's opinion.  
  
Also, try scrolling through a Word document while you have something selected... it does nothing, then about five seconds later it executes the motions.

apple,"I created a concept for a Reddit app for the Apple Watch, would love to hear your opinions and feedback on it!","#Thank you everyone for the feedback!  I've taken most of the feedback and incorporated it into a mini-redesign.  

Changes:

* App has been slimmed down.  Instead of being able to choose subreddits individually you can view the front page, which contains posts from your subscribed subreddits.  Or you can view all of the posts from all subreddits.
* Gone is the Apple-style home screen, replaced with a choice between the previously mentioned options.
* Also yanked was the ability to view individual subreddits on the home screen.  This should help to greatly reduce the scope of the app, and pushes it slightly to be more suitable for a watch.
* Front page changed yet again.  This time it is in a list view.  Gone is swiping to upvote/downvote.  Navigating up and down will be done by the digital crown.

Hello everyone!

First things first:

* If there are any developers out there who would like to partner with me to make this concept into an actual app, please PM me.

*  The app is tentatively called Watchit.  (Watch + Reddit = Watchit.)

With that out of the way, let's get to some images.

*****

##Front-facing mockups

####[Springboard](http://i.imgur.com/jo5UZ8X.jpg)
* This is the icon for the app, surrounded by all of the apps on your device.  

####[Home Screen](http://i.imgur.com/P0V9sG9.jpg)
* This is the main home screen of the app.  Here you can choose between the front page of all your subscribed to subreddits, or browse all posts from all of the subreddits.  **Note this has changed from before.**

####[Front page/All page](http://i.imgur.com/MlPhl0z.png)
* This is the screen where most of the magic happens.  Here, the posts for the subreddit you are currently in are displayed.  This for example is how the front page might look, and this same visual style will apply to all pages.  

####[Full Screen view, Upvoting/Downvoting a post](http://i.imgur.com/YH2XjGA.jpg)
* Simply tapping on a post will enlarge the picture or title of the post so you can view it as large as the screen allows.  Tapping close will bring you back to the subreddit. 

####[Force Touch Context Menu](http://i.imgur.com/DTs24tr.jpg)
* Force touching on a post will bring up a context menu where you can save the post to your Reddit account, share it, or send it to your iPhone where you can view the post within the companion iPhone app. 

####[New top post Short Look Notification](http://i.imgur.com/np9afmg.jpg)
* From the Apple Design Guidelines:  ""Short Looks let the user know which app received a notification and are visible only briefly."".

* In the Watch app, you will be able to be notified whenever a new post becomes the top post on the front page.  The interval at which this happens can be set within the companion app.  It can update in real time whenever positions change, or for example every 30 minutes.  Whichever you choose.

####[New top post Long look Notification (1) ](http://i.imgur.com/QJMosQN.jpg)
####[New top post Long Look Notification (2)](http://i.imgur.com/qdi6v33.jpg) (What you see when you scroll down)
* From the Apple Design Guidelines:  ""Long Looks provide more detail about an incoming notification.""

* In this app, Long Look notifications will show what the current post is (its content and its title.)  From the notification, you will be able to upvote, downvote, or save the post, as well as being able to dismiss the notification.

##Some info on the iPhone App.

I haven't yet designed the iPhone App that would ultimately ship with it.  The primary focus of the iPhone App would be to drive the Watch app.  When you send a post from the Watch and to your phone, you will be able to view the post on your iPhone.  I haven't decided how complex the iPhone app should be, but you'll be able to use it instead of the Watch if you so desire, with commenting, reading comments, and reading articles a stock feature.  Pricing hasn't been decided, but likely no more than $0.99.

Enjoy!

apple,"Who is The New 12"" Macbook Made For? A Different Perspective.","Since the 2015 Macbook 12"" was announced, I’ve seen quite a lot of bashing, judgement and speculation thrown around. I've seen many comments stating that no one in their right mind would buy one, and that we're idiots if we do. I've commented that it’s right for me, and was downvoted for stating my opinion. So, I wanted to submit this perspective from someone for whom this Macbook is made. People like me are the market, we actually do exist. And believe it or not, it has nothing to do with vanity. I'm not a ""basic white girl,"" I'm not a working from Starbucks attention seeking hipster, I'm not a casual email &amp; facebook only computer user. 

I'm an enterprise IT security consultant/architect/engineer, which means I travel a lot for work and am on my computer constantly. Portability has become very important to me. Even when I'm not traveling to or from the client, I'm walking from conference room to conference room carrying my computer, amongst other things, throughout the day. And sometimes I have to travel with two laptops. So I've been waiting forever, just like everyone else, for the MBA to finally get a Retina display. I almost pulled the trigger on the MBA a few times, anyway, but every time I looked at that screen, I just couldn’t do it. I was worried that if I did, my eyes would revenge stab me in the brain. My spoiled eyes *need* that Retina pixel density. 

Enter the 2015 12"" Macbook with Retina. After the reveal and considering the specs, I decided this was the next computer for me for reasons listed below. 

My order of priorities:

* **OS**
* **Display**
* **Form Factor/Portability**  
* SSD size
* RAM
* Battery Life
* CPU
* Ports

My perspectives:

* A lot of people have been saying the rMB is nothing more than a glorified iPad with a keyboard. Well, that actually sounds pretty good to me. I tried to pull that off before for traveling for work, I had an iPad air and the apple keyboard, but It turns out I really need OSX, can't get by on just iOS. (I also tried out a Windows hybrid w/ keyboard for one trip - it was horrible)
* Lack of Magsafe? I’m very happy about them moving toward the USB standard for charging and other functionality, and I much prefer the smaller wall wort and swappable cables. Also it would only be plugged in only a few times a day to charge, and usually not while I’m using it.
* Lack of ports? I almost never use my rMBP's ports now, so I don't really care. As far as data transfer, I have a 1TB Dropbox account and sync and archive to that (which I much prefer over iCloud). I can’t remember the last time I used a USB flash drive, external HD, or any kind of SD card. I prefer that they use all possible extra space for battery over anything else.
* Camera only 480p? I don’t use the camera on laptops for anything. In fact, I put tape over my camera due to the paranoia that comes with working in IT security.
* Slow CPU? That’s yet to be seen, but based on the available benchmarks of the Core-m I’m not worried. This is not usually where bottlenecks occur for me. I don’t game, I don’t edit video, I use imgur or Pixlr for very basic image editing, and development is light. Plus I ssh/RDP/TV for more intensive tasks and work.
* Also, I'm hoping the fanless low energy CPU will run much cooler than my rMBP 15"".
* Can’t get more than 8GB of RAM? That’s fine for me, but I'd probably upgrade when the next gen comes out. I'm usually under 8 on my rMBP that has 16, plus with the SSD, swapping is super fast.
* Price? I should just get a netbook for a fraction of the cost? Eh, I gladly pay a premium for build quality, materials, and superior engineering and integration. I've used netbooks, I don't like them. I have no use for Chrome OS. I don't have the time or inclination to tinker with *nix, anymore. Those days are long gone. Now I just want something that works well and doesn't get in the way. I love OSX. It feels like it's almost an extension of me when I’m on the computer. I was previously platform agnostic and frequently would switch platforms, but really I can’t imagine computing without OSX, Apple's trackpads, and gestures, anymore.
* And finally, and maybe the most important point: Apple has a 14 day return policy. If it turns out that I'm wrong, and the rMB just doesn’t cut it for me, I can return it and get the new rMBP 13"".

Anyway, this is just one non-casual user's perspective on why he believes the new Macbook will be perfect for him, and it obviously will not fit a majority of use cases. Please don't hurt me.

**EDIT:** some spelling mistakes and added the OS to the top of my priorities since it became clear to me that that is the most important aspect to me after re-reading my post.

**EDIT 2:** Just to be clear, I would prefer to have more power obviously, but I am also willing to make compromises based on my priorities. When the next generation comes out with better specs, I will be trading up.",996,1662,2015-03-14,AAPL,0.03902128525078297,0.8912668228149414,0.06971186213195324

I reckon I’ve turned it off and on again to prove how amazing the trackpad is more times than I’ve turned any other laptop off and on. It just feels like it’s clicking, it really does. 

And you can click anywhere on the trackpad, and force clicking works as you’d expect (you can open links in a pop up window now!), and 10-layer clicks for fast-forwarding in quicktime works perfectly with some finesse.

We don't know how or why, and we can't figure out how to fix it.  I have seen some posts where it was locked through iCloud using the find my phone/mac - but we didn't lose anything, and we didn't do anything specifically to lock it. 

Does anyone know why this would happen?  Also, over the last couple of days, she has not been getting her iMessages or been able to use Facetime.  Just to be safe, we changed her Apple ID password today, and most everything else she has a password with just to be safe.

Update: So it's still locked, and now it's just Apple being a douche. The original owner spent an hour on the phone with Apple last week, with 2 different people, and gave me the instructions to go the store, they can find the record and unlock it. Except that at the store, they couldn't find a record of the call when searching on the serial number. They explained that they can't search anyother way, and they won't try to. So they won't do anything. The original owner called them back, then Apple called me, and they were supposed to call me today - but they did not.  So now, a senior technition is supposed to call me on Monday. Basically, both myself and the original owner have done everything that Apple has asked us to do, but the various parts of Apple can't figure out how to do basic things, so it's still locked. We'll see what happens on Monday.

**UPDATE 2:** Aftere a crazy amount of phone calls, and Apple telling us different things to do, we were able to get into the store with the person who bought it and the receipt. They were able  to unlock it, but it was erased.  I can either just have them load up an operating system or take it to a data recovery place and see if they can get the files back.

You even get better battery life in comparison as a free bonus!

mac,"Your Mac, Top to Bottom: A Ride From the Firmware, to the Kernel, to User Space","Hey all, it's your giddy Mac enthusiast /u/5HT-2a again. Ever wonder exactly what ""firmware"" is? And what is this ""kernel"" thing we keep hearing about? These questions' answers, my friends, will take us through a journey that outlines the down-and-dirty of how a Mac works, from start to finish. Don't worry, I'll try to stick to the fun down-and-dirty!

----

##The Firmware: ""Quick, What Exit Do We Get Off?""

After pressing the power button, and after the machine has gone through its [hardware self-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test#Macintosh_POST), the first program the CPU will execute is loaded from the ""boot ROM."" The boot ROM is a small storage chip which is wired directly to the logic board, such that it can be read from immediately. The boot ROM is laborious to write to however; when performing a firmware update, it must be ""flashed"" with the new image. Thus, any pre-boot settings are stored in a more flexible chip, the NVRAM.

The software contained in the boot ROM is the firmware. This can be thought of as a minimalistic operating system, one whose job it is to determine how to proceed with booting into a ""real"" operating system. To do this, it is capable of basic tasks: reading from storage devices, sending text or graphics to the GPU, and responding to user input. The Mac's firmware is designed around Intel's EFI 1.1 specification, and as such, its abilities are mostly manifested by simple programs known as EFI applications.

Probably the most recognizable EFI application is the Mac's [boot manager](http://i.imgur.com/qvudI88.jpg), while other famed examples are [rEFIt](http://refit.sourceforge.net) and [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/). What EFI applications are run can be specified in a number of ways: If the firmware detects you holding the option key for example, it will launch the built-in boot manager. Or, if a specific application has been specified in the NVRAM (e.g. via the ""Startup Disk"" section of System Preferences), it will launch that. Failing all else, it will scan for application files at specific locations on your storage volumes.

To boot an operating system, the ""ultimate"" EFI application must be launched: The bootloader. OS X's bootloader is found at the following path on your startup volume (or on the Recovery HD partition if you use [CoreStorage](http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/2wzlxc/a_corestorage_primer_aka_why_you_cant_manipulate/)):

    /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi

So what does this ""bootloader"" application do? It locates and executes the kernel!

##The Kernel: ""Don't Worry, I Know How To Drive This Thing""

The first (and last) component of OS X to run is the kernel. The kernel is the the central core of the operating system, fulfilling all the most basic and crucial operations. Different operating systems have their respective kernels; Windows uses the Windows NT kernel, and Ubuntu uses the Linux kernel, to name a couple examples. OS X's kernel is known as *XNU*.

The first responsibility XNU assumes is to interact with the hardware. It sends data to and from storage devices, responds to input and output from peripheral devices, sends code to the GPU to be executed, etcetera. When launched by the bootloader, the firmware hands most of these devices directly over to it (a notable exception being the GPU, which works by executing its own mini-kernels delivered to it via the firmware).

When launching, one of the first things XNU must do is mount your boot volume. XNU is responsible for coordinating everything file-related; this extends not just to the raw 1's and 0's sent to and from storage devices, but also interpreting filesystems. Anytime a program requests access to a file, XNU fulfills (or refuses to fillfil) the request based on its interpretation of the raw data.

Again, this control over system resources applies to all hardware in general. XNU also divvys up CPU time to processes, deciding when and for how long they may run. It portions out RAM, giving it (or, if necessary, denying it) to processes when they request it. Since it has master control over all system resources, it is XNU's responsiblitly to maintain safety and security with with them. When a process requests a file or block of memory, it is XNU's job to determine whether it has permission to access it.

##User Space: ""Stay In Your Lane!""

So, what are ""processes?"" All operating systems utilize the concept, but processes aren't really tangible entities. A process is simply a collection of resources which the kernel keeps segregated from its operation, and from that of other processes. This iron curtain between the kernel's activities (""kernel space"") and that of processes (""user space"") is important for the system's security and stability.

The kernel creates processes by loading their code into memory (usually from executable files) and pointing the CPU to it. It maintains strict records for every process created, and these records alone define processes; they specify things like what name the process has, who ran it and under what conditions, and, most importantly, the regions of memory that have been allocated to it. ""Memory boundaries"" ensure that the data you are working with can only be accessed by the process it was intended for, and or course, it is the kernel's job to ensure that this is enforced.

It is also the kernel's job to dermine when processes are granted time on the CPU to execute. Depending on the number of logical cores in your CPU, the typical Mac can execute somewhere between two to eight instructions simultaneously. On the other hand, there may be a hundred processes to be executed at any given moment. Thus, processes must be juggled for the system to function. The kernel is constantly putting processes to ""sleep"" and reawakening them.

Once the kernel has mounted the filesystem, it loads the executable file for one process in particular to spawn, and that is `launchd`. In OS X, `launchd` does most the work of arbitrating which programs should be run when. If a program needs to be run at startup, `launchd` handles that. When you launch an application, it is `launchd` that sets up the execution of its binary... And so we arrive.

Anyway, thanks for reading! If you're like me, you got enjoyment out of all these details (otherwise I probably just bored the crap out of you).

In any case, if you have any questions, or if I got something wrong or left out something crucial, do the comment thing.

iphone,"Another sneak peek at Apollo, a brand new Reddit app for iPhone (public beta details inside, plus a look at some new features!)","Hey all,

I'm building a new Reddit app called Apollo, and I wanted to keep all you lovely people in the loop on how it's coming, so today I'm giving a look at some features I've been working on recently, and a date for the public beta launch so you can all get ready. :)

If you're hearing about Apollo for the first time, it's a brand new Reddit app for iPhone that's coming soon. I'm a former Apple intern, and I wanted to build the perfect Reddit experience for mobile, which has culminated into Apollo. I built it to be super fast, smooth and comfortable for browsing, with an emphasis on feeling right at home on your iPhone and iOS 8. It features large, gorgeous thumbnails, gestures for quickly navigating around, the Jump Bar for jumping between subreddits really quickly, a super easy commenting window with live preview, easy to read comments, a dark theme, and a ton of customizable functionality. 

There's much more to it, and even more previews of features in the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2w7ypk/another_sneak_peek_at_apollo_a_brand_new_reddit/) and the thread [prior to that](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/).

You can check out http://apolloapp.io and sign up to get an email delivered as soon as it launches.

Let me show you a few more details. :)

# Easy, Powerful Commenting

[Commenting](http://i.imgur.com/CPZMB8K.png)

Apollo features super easy, yet super powerful commenting and post-creation features. As you type, your formatting is applied live, instantly and inline. You can easily style text, insert images (and have them optionally upload directly to your Imgur account) and insert titled links.

If you're replying to a user and you want to remember what exactly they said, their comment is a quick swipe away where you can re-read it in its entirety, copy some text, or marvel at some fancy adjectives. Swipe back to continue writing your comment.

# Jump Bar: Quickly Bounce Between Subreddits (and Multireddits)

[Jump Bar](http://i.imgur.com/wk3dg2p.png)

I jump between specific subreddits a lot, so I wanted to make that super easy to do in Apollo. You simply tap the title of the subreddit and a dropdown flows out with your favorite subreddits just a tap away. If you have a specific subreddit in mind that you haven't favorited, just tap again and type a few letters, letting autocomplete take care of the rest. If you want to jump right to this quick-input, just hold down on the title instead of tapping.

As Apollo **will be supporting multi-reddits**, you can easily search your multi-reddits here as well. They'll be distinguished with a simple indicator so you can identify them.

# Quick Gestures for Getting to Comments

[Gestures](http://i.imgur.com/6kDhUAS.png)

You know how natural and fast it is to slide to go back to the previous screen in iOS? That same gesture will slide the comments for whatever you're viewing onto the screen. So if you're viewing an image overlay, simply slide from the right to the left to view the comments lickety-split. Similarly, if you accidentally go back, have no fear, you can simply slide the screen back like in Safari.

Quick gestures like these are prevalent all through Apollo, making common actions super fast to do, and navigating delightful.

# Beta Date!

And last but not least, I've decided on a date for when the beta will drop. Apollo's in a great place for a beta right now where a great deal of it is done and I want to catch any bugs, so I'd love to hear input from all of you lovely people.

So, the date is: **Monday, March 30th**. In order to be fair to people in different timezones, the beta will open at two times, the first at 12 PM PST, and the other at 12 AM PST (12 hours later, technically March 31st in PST), with 500 spots each. This should allow people who were asleep when the first chance arrived to be awake and have their wheaties.

To make it really easy, here are two countdown timers, one to the first timeslot, and one to the second.

- [Countdown to first beta time](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=time%20until%20march%2030th%2012%3A00%20pm%20pst)
- [Countdown to second beta time](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=time+until+march+31st+12%3A00+am+pst)

And, in the interest of being honest, TestFlight only allows 1,000 beta testers, which means that while I'd love to have everyone, that's not possible. :( If you miss out on the beta, the actual release won't be too far off, so don't fret!

Remember to sub to /r/apolloapp, that's where I'll be posting the beta signup form. :)

Hope you all like what you see, and I'm really excited to hear your thoughts when you get the beta in your hands. :) If you have any questions or comments please comment, I try to read and respond to every one!

apple,"If you have still having WiFi issues with Yosemite and don't know why, I came across a solution today","I know that this sub would prefer a link but I wanted to offer some help to those still having this issue with Yosemite.

At work today after doing some exhaustive research and testing we have found that Yosemite contains a substantial flaw in a 802.11 protocol. For whatever reason, Apple's implementation of 802.11h has a fault (Community Thread to be edited in soon at bottom). Users will find that their device may work well on some and not others. The reason is that older routers normally do not have a *signal power setting,* therefore they broadcast at full power. More advanced routers and access points have adjustable cell sizes (scalable transmission and reception thresholds) which cause the 802.11h protocol to fail on Yosemite.

If you are or have contact with a network administrator who can verify this, please have them check. ***When 802.11h is enabled only channels 36, 40, 44, and 48 will behave correctly. Any 2.4GHz and all other 5GHz channels will provide an initial connection and DHCP but the Yosemite device will fail to even ping the gateway thereafter.*** If you have troubles with your own router and cannot find this setting, change your 5GHz manually to one of the four above and test to see if this works.

Our hardware supplier took the information I provided from my tests and said that they had already begun working with Apple on this. I hope that the next OS release will patch this. For now, try this as a temporary solution.

**EDIT:** [This is the Community Discussion](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6825371)

**EDIT #2**

802.11h is a wireless standard used by modern devices to avoid network interference. There are two major parts: channel selection and signal strength. DFS (Dynamic frequency selection) is used to detect when other network-providing devices or same-frequency devices – such as cordless phones – are using the same or an overlapping channel. Once detected the DFS-enabled device will then choose another channel for broadcasting. This is implemented in almost every router and peer-to-peer capable device – used sometimes for ad-hoc connections. TPC (Transmit power control) calculates the power level to be used in order to reduce overlapping coverage with other wifi-broadcasting devices. Commercial-sized networks are the most common networks to use this as large-area coverage can cause major problems. 2.4GHz routers/access points needs this due to a lack of radio channels that do not overlap (1, 6, 11) while 5GHz needs this when it combines radio channels to make signals more robust or when other devices use the same channel. (You can search for ""channel bonding"" for more about 5GHz performance and potential issues)

What this means for you is that if your home router auto-detects signal interference and adjusts its broadcasting power level you are more likely to see this as the culprit to your problems. It's an Apple-sided fault. The community link above shows that variable power levels cause a calculation error by the Yosemite device, rendering the connection useless rather quickly. Apple routers do not seem to have this issue as they broadcast at full power. However, other brands have more options for customization that can be tweaked which may result in your lack of wifi connectivity.

If you have problems at home and can adjust your router's settings, search for a 802.11h option under your (wireless) advanced settings. If available for modifying try disabling it and see if it helps at all.",47,182,2015-03-20,AAPL,0.06647006422281265,0.9046748876571655,0.028855064883828163

apple,A new Apple TV with an A8X Processor would be about as powerful as a Playstation 3. Do you think Apple will do it??,"How hard do you think Apple will press the gaming on a refreshed Apple TV?

They've already put the pieces in place:

* MFi controllers were introduced in 2013 and are *widely* supported on the App Store.  All major titles that were originally designed around controller based inputs (such as Disney Infinity Toy Box 2.0 or Bastion) already support physical hardware controllers on iOS *today*.  This means that controller-based gaming on Apple TV is already ready to go.
* Apple recently increased the App Store's maximum App size to 4GB.  Shortly there-after, Disney Infinity Toy Box 2.0 came to the App Store, powered by Metal, with Xbox 360-equivalent graphics, weighing a hefty 4.4GB!
* The A8 and A8X processors in the latest iOS devices support the Metal graphics APIs and are absolute beasts.  Per [this article on AppleInsider](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/23/new-apple-tv-with-app-store-would-enter-apple-into-35-billion-home-gaming-market) an A8X processor that is in the iPad Air 2, driving a 1080P display, could have a fill rate and graphics equivalent to a PS3.  

The pieces are there.  We have a huge library of games that already support controllers, and a hardware controller ecosystem that while still maturing, is already quite comprehensive.  We have App binaries large enough to offer games with enough assets and content to compete with console titles from the last generation.  And most important we have a relatively inexpensive SoC, with companion low-level graphics APIs, that can go head to head with all but the most bleeding edge gaming machines.

What do you guys think?  I think Apple could make a major play to be the only game console *most* households would ever need.  And I think that the nature of the App Store would create a positive feedback loop where if an Apple TV-as-gaming-console even got its foot in the door, it would quickly spiral into a massive success driven by a huge wave of developer adoption.

It will never be the machine hardcore gamers proclaim their undying loyalty to, but it could certainly be the machine most kids grow up playing games on.  What do you think??",364,442,2015-03-23,AAPL,0.021275589242577553,0.9251657128334045,0.053558677434921265

apple,I found an Apple Extended Keyboard II at work in mint condition! This thing is so flippin' awesome! (pics in description),"I was digging around in our graveyard of old parts outside the Batcave the other day. The graveyard is sort of our staging area for old equipment that ought to be recycled, but that we haven't gotten around to yet - and I came across a glorious box. An Apple Extended Keyboard II! I'm the only Apple guy in our IT department, so I can see how nobody snatched this up before me, but I was beside myself when I found it. 

It was in basically mint condition, the box had been opened at one time, but the keyboard was obviously never used. Still had the plastic bag and documentation. 

Up until now, I'd been using Apple's aluminum keyboard for years and years, and had always been quite happy with it, but this Extended Keyboard has been a joy to use. I was fortunate enough to recognize it for what it was, and I've been very pleased with it. It's my first mechanical keyboard, and I finally see what everyone has been on about for years. This thing is a joy to type with! I'm even thinking of picking up another one on eBay (assuming I can find one in primo condition) to replace my Apple Wireless Keyboard at home.

mac,An embarrassing problem with MEGA while using Google Chrome. Please do not upvote.,"So, I was on the usual prowl for some faptastic materials on my faithful Google Chrome. In the middle of the prowl, I stumbled upon this wonderful [gif \(obv nsfw\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/NSFW_GIF/comments/304huz/that_look_on_her_face/), and decided to download the source video that was linked to in the comments. This is the [link](https://mega.co.nz/#!NN8iDKgY!VUO74BYseAbUF4LqkDn67toA4-2P2HHyy51fLXOOGR4).

I was delighted to find that the link led me to a mega.co.nz link, as I can download files from that website at really high speeds. However, the download would fail every time I tried to download this 4.4GB motherload, and I could feel myself and my sad dick die a little each time this happened.

Funny thing is, the download would actually continue until 100%, but then the browser would show that the download attempt had actually failed. So I fired up Firefox to try to download this file, and it worked. (2 failed attempts to download a 4.4GB file on Chrome, succeeded on the third try with Firefox)

Besides the fact that the source video was disappointing at best, it turned out that I was exactly 8.8GB short on my SSD space, and I suspected that it was due to some temporary file hidden somewhere on my computer. Does anybody have any idea where mega.co.nz on Chrome hides its temp files?

All you have to do is to open your notes app, skip few lines with the return button(u might need to put a space on every new line), then tap two times, 'Select all' and copy that into ur snapchat messege box.

iphone,¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Custom Keyboard to type emoticons (text faces) - My effort to teach myself a little bit of Swift - (link in text),"I wanted to get a little bit of experience and try writing an app in Swift, so I created a custom keyboard (TypeFace) where I could type text faces, without having to try and copy and paste them from somewhere. If you're interested, feel free to [check it out](https://appsto.re/us/gI9b6.i).

I wanted to make sure and not ask for a lot of permissions like some keyboards, so this app doesn't require any special permissions at all, other than enabling the keyboard. Because of that limitation, you can't add your own, but I'd be happy to add some in an update. (Or allow you to add your own, if you think you and everybody else would be willing to give the app complete permissions.)

apple,iPhone AMBER alerts discussion (X-post /r/michigan),"Everyone seems to be in agreement. The iPhone's AMBER alert needs change.

1. The notification sound needs to be different than the 'imminent danger' severe weather alert. Just notify us, don't send us into cardiac arrest.

2. The notification needs to be silent when we ask it to be. The only option for iPhone users is to turn it off completely.

Edit: 3. The notifications as they stand are causing people to turn them off. The child's family needs to reach as many awake and willing people as possible.

apple,My weekend project: a Thunderbolt2 external GPU for my rMBP,"[Here are a few pictures of the finished build](http://imgur.com/a/QdhdB?gallery)

Unfortunately Intel has categorically refused to license any external [TB GPU enclosures](http://www.eteknix.com/computex-silverstone-t004-mitx-chassis-on-display), likely due to their vested interest in CPU-based video chipsets. It's one of Intel's classic anti-competitive practices that ultimately screws the end-user and allows them to keep selling their subpar GMA500/Iris/etc.

I read [this article](http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/04/intel-demonstrates-light-peak-on-a-laptop-says-10gbps-speeds-ar/) about 5 ago, and have been waiting ever since to buy a commercial product. Eventually I grew tired of waiting and read about [building your own](http://forum.techinferno.com/diy-e-gpu-projects/6578-implementations-hub-tb-ec-mpcie.html#post89707). This process is greatly simplified by Thunderbolt 2, as it bridges DP/PCI-E in a fast and elegant package. What used to take multiple steps and devices, can now be accomplished (at full speed) with one.

I couldn't believe it actually worked! My home button on my iPhone 6 had just this tiiiiny bit of play and an extra click sound before i fully depressed it, and it was driving me nuts. I took an alcohol prep pad (little individually wrapped squares of cotton soaked in isopropyl alcohol - you can get 'em at nearly any drug store) and rubbed the button as shown in the video. Voila! No more weird play in the button or click. A problem I'd had since the first day I opened the phone is *gone.* Now the button feels just like it does on my iPad mini. Awesome.
