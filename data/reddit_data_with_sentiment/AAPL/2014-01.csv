apple,Maverics Mail.app on two machines behaving differently.,"...And I can't figure out how they're configured differently.

My work Mac pulls my personal gmail account immediately, changes to read/archived status on my iPhone shows up promptly on that app, and it generally behaves just fine.

My personal Mac lags behind in syncing the gmail account--sometimes the app needs to be restarted to get it pulling mail again. And it's not looking at the same thing to determine if a message is in the inbox; messages deleted elsewhere stay in inbox on this machine until I delete them here. Read status DOES seem to sync.

iphone,"A quick question related to AT&amp;T iPhone 5S unlocking (off-contract, phone bought at full price)","Hey /r/iPhone, sorry if this has been asked before. Tried searching, and every answer/question relating to this had to do with iPhones that were still in contract, and as such, were refused unlocks for that reason.

Anyway.

A friend of mine ended up busting his iPhone 5 by dropping it, and rather than just go and get it fixed, he decided to just go all in and buy a new 5S out of contract, opting to go to an AT&amp;T store to do it so he could trade in his cracked 5. (In case it's relevant, the 5 was bought secondhand and off contract.) He bought his 5S, and was told that he would have to call customer care to get his 5S unlocked (since, y'know, he bought it full retail)

This was all in October. He tried to get it unlocked a week after buying the phone, but he was refused. The online device unlock service said that ""this device cannot be unlocked"", and AT&amp;T's customer care told him that 5S unlocks are not available at this time. Given that this was around the time that AT&amp;T put a lockdown on their device unlocks, it wasn't too far fetched.

However, lately AT&amp;T service near his house has gone to shit, and he's been eyeing T-Mobile. Given that it's been some time since he last tried to unlock, he gave it another go, and is getting the same exact response, and some reps have told him it's because he's still on contract. He's even faxed in his receipts proving he paid full retail for the phone, and no dice.

...which he is, but he last signed contract in April (when he got a Galaxy S4, ended up selling it and buying his 5, whose IMEI is not associated with a contract at all), and again, he bought the 5S at *full retail*. Unless AT&amp;T transfers contract status to new IMEIs, I can't see how that makes sense.

His account isn't exactly new, either--he's on a 3-line family plan that's been kicking around for 8 years. So it definitely isn't because his account is less than 90 days old.

Is there something we're missing here, or are AT&amp;T just screwing us around?

**tl;dr**: AT&amp;T refuses to unlock non-contract 5S bought in-store at full price. Friend is in contract, but with a completely different phone. Even with faxed proof of purchase, AT&amp;T still refuses unlock. What do?",8.0,5,2014-01-01,AAPL,0.0903797447681427,0.8793147206306458,0.03030550293624401

iphone,Is there anything I can do to switch my new 5s for a different 5s?,"Basically, I think I have a lemon of a phone. It's a 64 gb 5s. I got it at the end of October. 
  
Previously, I had a 4s with ZERO problems. I had great reception in my  house. Never dropped a call etc.  phone was fast. Never froze. Flawless for the most part.  
  
Within the 20 minutes it took to activate my 5s, I said goodbye to the 4-5 bars with my 4s (at my house), and said hello to a constant one bar, call dropping 5s. Literally. I activated the phone on my computer. Shut down my 4s with 5 bars, powered the 5s... 1 bar. Didn't even leave my room.
  
I took it to Apple and to Sprint. Apple ran a diagnostics test on it. Said all was well. Sprint said the same, and didn't even use ""working on towers"" as an excuse. 
  
On top of poor reception, the phone is glitchy. I have factory reset it a few times. Updated it every update etc.  
  
And when I say glitchy, it won't scroll immediately sometimes. It seems overwhelmed sometimes. My iMessage won't display images occasionally, and I have to factory reset it. Plugging in a stereo jack to listen to music freezes the screen, until it's unplugged and plugged back in. 

 

 It's really a stinky balls of a phone. 

  
After both Apple and Sprint being so ""whatever"" about my concerns... What can I do here? My main concern is my reception. Everytime my phone rings I'm ready for the constant, ""you're breaking up. What? What?"" Etc.
  
And it just boggles my mind, to go from 4-5 bars at home with my 4s, to 1 bar with my 5s.

apple,I need some help in regards to bootcamp.,"I recently made the mistake of purchasing an external hard drive on amazon which isn't compatible with OSX (it was a big sale and I read a couple of misleading reviews of the hard drive).

 I know the first thing they tell you to do when partitioning is to back up your operating system, how likely is it that I could brick my mac while doing this? As well my hard drive is too fragmented to go through with the process anyways, this means another process which requires backing up. **Would the Apple Store help in either the defrag/carbon copying process or the bootcamp process?** It just occurs to me that the process is kind of simple, all I need is a hard drive to use once.

I have an older 27"" iMac that I replaced as my main computer that I'd still like to use as a monitor, as I prefer its screen real estate for things like research/writing, as well as gaming.  **What I'm looking for in a dock is the ability close my computer and essentially use it as a Mac Mini -- use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and have all the information sent to the display of my old iMac** (I've checked its inputs so I know it can do this).  I know that Henge doesn't currently support the rMPBs; is there something else out there that fills this niche, or will I be waiting a while?

A lot of the docks I've seen mostly seem to fulfill the role of connectivity, but this isn't a big deal at all to me; I barely use any of my ports, so things like the Belkin one that came out don't really suit me.  Many of them also *seem* to expect the notebook to still be in use when its docked (i.e. screen open), and that's quite different from my intended use.  I'd really appreciate if anyone more knowledgeable in this area could give me some suggestions or point me in the right direction (even if that direction is just knowing that there aren't currently any amazing options for what I'd like to do)!

This Christmas, I got a gift certificate for the Apple Store (booyah!) and am thinking about getting an iPad. However, I'm wondering if there are any Microsoft Office-Compliant apps that meet my (admittedly stringent) requirements:

- Must be more-or-less completely compliant with Microsoft Office. (I'm a graduate student and a freelance copywriter, so whatever I create on my iPad needs to work with your standard Office suite.)
- Needs to work without being connected to the cloud and have local storage options. (I travel a fair bit and don't plan on getting an iPad with a cell connection; I already have an iPhone.)
- Needs to be able to manually sync with Dropbox. Using a third-party app to do so is no problem. (I use Dropbox to store all of my documents on my home computer.)

apple,Rant: the new Mac Pro - a product designer's opinion.,"It's amazing. Here's why.

It's a post-PC world, sales are declining, Windows is dying. Well, it's true. The PC is unchanged for decades. It's the same - a big rectangular case, big fans that suck in air and dust in and expel hot air. I would say it's *primitive*, and it's the same for years. Maybe the shape changed, from a box to a square or other tower variants, but the idea is the same - a box filled with cards that fit on a motherboard, a power supply, drive units, fans for air cooling or water cooling systems. 

The other issue is that most PC cases today are not exactly elegant in design. You can't show off your super sci-fi PC case, and most of them come with absurd features, like camouflage patterns, colored LED's, over the top exhaust grilles.  They don't fit anywhere in a room or house (unless you are a teenager). You'd think since so many people have PC's, there'd be more elegant solutions available for people over 20 years of age (the same happens in other parts of the market, like keyboards and mice).

Apple always did design right, and *they* have elegant products available. A Macbook or iMac looks great on a desk: you don't cringe when you see it, it's aestathically pleasing, you want to touch it and look at it and carry it with it. However, these examples are from another category: laptops and all-in-one-monitor-PC's. If you want a real PC you're stuck with the 
same metal boxes. There are a handful of options, like cases from Streacom or Silverstone (FT03).

There isn't a good trade-off between form and function - absurd sci-fi cases are just cheesy form, and on the other side there are server racks, which are pure function, but you can't exactly put them in your living space.

Here's what Apple does with the Mac Pro - it solves all of these issues. First, it's an incredible elegant design. It disposes of radiators with coolers on top, attached with crude thermal paste to the processing units. The boards are inverted and all of them attached to a central radiator, and a single fan  pulls air over it, in a natural induction direction, bottom-to-top. The hardware is outside and separate from the cooling solution on the inside, so dust will never get in. It's a step above the crude solution to the ""stick everything in a box"" solution we had before. It's thought out, and the function creates the cylindrical form. It's a tiny, elegant PC that looks good on a desk, on a shelf. 

You don't want to hide it under the table, you want to look at it! It's finally evolution for the out-dated PC form. Laptops and tablets took off because they were also thought-out, shrinked PC's, and heavily emphasize user interaction. 

The new design loses user customization, but the market needs a budge in order to produce alternatives (replaceable cards and CPU) for this new inside/outside design, and Apple is big enough to do this. 

The Mac Pro is the future of the PC and I can't wait to see where this will lead the industry (Apple is after all responsbile for the ultrabooks, modern smartphones, the push for high-res displays and many other good stuff). This is the nudge the PC market needs, and Mac Pro is selling, despite the cost. Imagine if there was a cheaper standard solution available.

The PC is dead because it's the same for decades, a big, bulky, crude box. Naturally, people don't buy them anymore - there's nothing new since 1990 and tablets and phones do things better, but for the millions of people that don't want to be limited with a tablet, something amazingly designed like the Mac Pro can be *the* solution.",287.0,78,2014-01-06,AAPL,0.05777035281062126,0.9156575202941895,0.026572048664093018

mac,MBPr + external drive + tons of video/photos = few questions,"Good morning! I have a few questions and looking for some recommendations on what workflows/backup ideas y'all use for backing up pictures and video. 


I have a 2012 MBPr with a 256gb SSD and a ton of my space is being filled up with video (40gb) and pictures (60gb). I've been into photography for several years and more recently video via a GoPro. I do local backups to an external drive via time machine and also individual drag/drop backups of my pictures/video just in case time machine falters. 


I'd like to reduce the size of the video/pictures on my local hard drive and am thinking about different strategies to best protect myself from losing any data.


Questions:

* The only full size pics/video I really need to keep on my local hard drive are my wedding pictures and video. I’m thinking of exporting all of my pics and reducing the size via the export tool and then clearing my iPhoto library and re-creating it based on the smaller size pics. This way I keep the pics accessible at all times, but they’re not huge files (I’m rarely printing personal pics for the most part that are larger than a 8x10). 
* I’ve heard time machine will eventually start replacing old data with new data? IE when the backup is completely full it will start removing older backups. 
* I currently use backblaze and overall like it, but I didn’t realize that once you remove files from your computer within 30 days those files will drop off from the backblaze backup. I originally thought I could upload all my pics/video to it as a true offsite backup, but this is not the case. I’ve thought about using Google Drive for something like this and just upload all my full size video/pics to it. Thoughts on this strategy? Better site or options (flickr/picasa)?


Thanks in advance for taking a look at this.

apple,Apple Customer Service blows me away!,"In some form or fashion I've been a been a Mac / Apple owner since 1998.  In early December, my mid-2011 27"" iMac starting having display issues.  I took it into Apple Store, and because of Apple Care the repair was free.  As soon as I brought the repaired Mac home, the issue started happening again. (captured it on video this time)  Called the Genius Bar at the Apple Store and explained the repair (which had taken 6 days the last time) didn't work.  They said bring it back it, and we'll make it our top priority.   This time when I dropped it off they said they would repair the logic board, and replace the LCD and see if that fixed the issue.  5 days later I was notified  the repair was complete.  Brought it home, and once again, the issue started happening about 30 minutes after booting the machine up.  Needless to say, I was furious.  I called the Apple Store, I explained what had happened (the repair tech I was speaking too had done the work on my machine), the technician was apologetic and asked me to come back to the store.  I walk in (lugging my 27 inch iMac….again) and am taken right to the Genius Bar.  The technician says they have done everything they can do, and it’s their fault they can’t correctly diagnose and fix the issue. (of which I have plenty of video evidence) Then he asks if I would be OK with Apple paying for my next iMac.  Wait what?  That was the last thing I was expecting them to say.   30 minutes later, I walked out the Apple Store with a brand new iMac.

mac,Storage strategy. Please share your thoughts.,"Hi, guys!

I own Mac Mini and pretty happy with this silent box that is on 24/7 in my bedroom. I use it as a home server to store and stream photo, music,  develop apps and also it doubles as an expensive USB charger for them. 

Now it seems like I have some budget and need in upgrading performance, increasing capasity and implementing backup policy. I want to have maximum speed, scaling storage, redundancy and minimum noise.

My options are:

1) buy 180gb internal SSD to form a Fusion drive with existing slow 500Gb and also buy 2x3Tb NAS to store iTunes, iPhoto and TimeMachine. I like this approach, it should be scalable, safe, mobile and completely silent as NAS will be outta bedroom, but I heard that iPhoto doensn't work well on non-HFS partitions and this is a no-no for large iPhoto/Aperture databases. 

2) buy 180gb internal SSD to form an internal Fusion drive and also buy 2 external 3Tb USB 3.0 drives. Is it possible to make them act like a HFS+ RAID1?.. Will they be noisy as crickets? Should I use 2 or 3 inch disks or maybe I miss some silent affordable 2-disk HFS+ DASs?...

3) throw away existing 500 gb drive, buy two 3Tb internal drives to form internal RAID 1 and also buy an external USB3.0 SSD to form a Fusion Drive with this RAID? Or just as a scratch disk?... It should be silent and relatively compact, but it's not scalable and I don't know if this is possible.

However, for the first time there is an option at the bottom that says ""Show Complete Album"".  Having never seen this before I clicked it out of curiosity and get taken to one of the albums in the collection, but all the tracks are greyed out.  I now have the option to ""Complete My Album"" ... ok so now I'm thinking something didn't download correctly so I click and get taken to the album in the iTunes store and all songs show as purchased.  

I head back to the Music App and go to each album individually and there it shows all tracks downloaded and ready to play.

It's really weird, I have never seen anything like this before and I have been using iPhones since iPhone 4!

So I'm installing bootcamp. I did everything normally, opened up the bootcamp assistant, partitioned the drive, inserted the windows install disk to an external drive (no internal super drive on these models), and then I plugged in a USB for the drivers.

Everything was working fine here. I continued installing windows until I got to the windows screen. I tried to install the drivers, but since there *were* no drivers, I couldn't access the USB stick, or the CD drive, since it is external and requires USB.

I tried accessing the windows partition through OSX, but it's read only, so I couldn't drag the drivers there. I tried the reverse, but couldn't even browse to OSX through the windows disk management.

There's no Ethernet port, so I can't access that, and I can't use wireless to install third party programs or search for drivers.

I also removed the SSD, but it isn't sata, so I couldn't use a second computer to drag the drivers over.

Since this has no USB drivers, no internal DVD/CD drive, and the drive is non sata. I have no idea how to install the drivers. Any help?

I'll update if I find a solution. Thanks a lot.",2.0,7,2014-01-15,AAPL,0.10187974572181702,0.8661196827888489,0.032000549137592316

mac,"Want to purchase a 13"" Macbook Air. Should I go for a 2013 or save a bit and get a 2012?","So I'm interested in getting a MBA for classes, just for note taking, internet browsing, Netflix, and very occasionally light Photoshop. I've been wanting to stay under $1000 for my purchase, and someone just listed a 2013 MBA for $950.

In my area (Orange County), 2012s are going for $850 (some even cheaper), and I haven't seen many 2013s for $950. I've never had a Macbook before, so I don't know if the differences are worth the $100. I'd like to save as much as possible, but if the difference is that great, I wouldn't mine spending the extra $100.

What's important to me is battery life, since I'm a student and can't always get a plug. I don't know if this is relevant, but I'm currently using a Thinkpad T520 with an i5 processor, 8 GB RAM, and a 120 SSD. It suits all my needs, but is a bit heavy and I think I can get more battery life out of a MBA.

apple,OS X Window Management Question,"Hey all, I currently own and use only Windows computers.  I had a Powerbook in the past, but it's been a while.  I'm considering getting a new iMac in the near future and have a question on Windowing / window management.

In Windows, The standard widgets in the upper-right hand corner of all windows are minimize (shrink the window to the taskbar), maximize (make the window take up the whole screen on the monitor) and close (close the app).  OS X has Yellow, Green and Red circles.  I can't recall exactly what they do.  I think yellow is minimize.  If I recall Green did something weird like make the window bigger but not full screen, and red closed the window.  Can someone clarify?

Also, Windows has some nice features for making a window take up exactly half your screen.  You can drag and ""Snap"" the window to the leftmost or rightmost side of your screen to have the window take up 1/2 half the screen (split vertically).  You can also hold the windows key and hit the arrow keys left and right to snap the window into different positions.  Does OS X have equivalent functions?

If I recall, one of my frustrations with OS X when I used it back in the day (like 10.2) was the windowing functions.  It seemed at the time that Windows OS gave better control and had better features for managing the positions of the Windows on the screen.  So. . . .I'm hoping OS X is improved in this area, or I'm hoping I'm just ignorant of how to do what I want and that someone cool can educate me.

I run Photoshop CS6, a few hundred browser tabs with lots of reddit and some web development, an email client, Pages, and less frequently mild video editing. I game from time to time with a Windows 8 parallels installation on an external HDD. My choice is between a refurbished MacBook Air 2013 13"" ($930) and a refurbished baseline MacBook Pro 13"" ($1099) with 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD on each. Both benchmark over double my MBP (Geekbench 3 64bit scores 2300, while the MBA gets 5000 and the MBP 2013 gets 6300). I fell in love with the retina display, but I feel like I need more justification than that for $170 extra. The benchmarks aren't that significantly different. Can anyone actually attest to the real world performance of each? Gaming, video exporting, overall feel, etc. I'm okay with only 9 hours of battery life on the retina vs 16 on the Air considering I only get 2 and half on my Pro. Is the 4GB RAM Pro worth the extra $170 over the Air?

Growl - http://growl.info/ - This application is one that allows me to see notifcations without having to take up much screen room. When i'm working on a project last thing i want to see is a massive update that someone has added me on linkdin, so this is the perfect app. have the notfiaction type set to nano, to keep everything small. Works fantastic, also allows you to set up notifactions when renders finnish in AfterEffects or Premire

BetterTouchTool - http://www.boastr.net/ - My god, this is prob my most used app. As i normally use 2 screens its a must, it allows the windows 7 snapping feature of pulling a window to the top to go full screen or to the side to go halfscreen. If you dont use this. download it today it is amazing.

Where I am, there are no stores to go to and pick something up (I mean, online, yeah, but besides that, nothing), and the only person who might give face-to-face lessons is the high school teacher I work with, who's frankly pretty booked, anyhow.

I actually do have an old, sort–of-in-tune piano at the school I can use, too, so then it crossed my mind that there might be a good app for getting sheet music on my iPad, or even just something else I could read or follow along on the piano.

Great options would be a Nexus branded phone, Google Play Edition phone, or even a Moto X/G.

Companies like Samsung, LG, Sony, and others skin Android adding their own flavor to the phone.  This works for some but usually is a bad representation of the true Android experience.  These OEMs are also slow with updates and are usually running a few releases behind.  

I see people make the switch and pick up a galaxy s4 and never get to really experience what Android has to offer because all of the Samsung junk added that cannot be removed.

I have a late 2011 macbook pro.  I've had 199 cycles put into it.  I regularly let the battery completely drain and let it recharge.  Overall, I take good care of it.",13.0,8,2014-01-23,AAPL,0.06951124221086502,0.8847301006317139,0.04575865715742111
apple,I switched to OS X Mavericks from Windows 8 and I'm never going back.,"Three months ago, I bought and installed Windows 8 on all the computers in my house (a laptop and two desktops), upgrading from Windows 7. A month into the new OS and I found myself suffering major buyer's remorse. 

I hated the new UI. Everything about it felt like working too hard to do something Windows 7 had done easily. Still, Windows 7 had grown boring and bland, so I decided to give Apple a try. Previously, the only experience I'd had with an Apple product was an old iPod Classic that served me well for half a decade. 

Feeling extremely frustrated and disappointed in Microsoft's new OS, I took to Craigslist to find a new computer. I looked up iMac, Mac Mini, and Macbook Pro postings. Eventually, I settled on two iMacs and a Mac Mini. I also picked up an Ipad Air to replace my laptop. 

Now, two months later, I'm sitting in front of my beautiful Mac Mini as I write this posting. The thing about this Mac, though, is that it's five years old. Both the iMacs I picked up are seven years old, which is how I could afford them in the first place. 

I installed Mavericks on the computers, which had come with Snow Leopard, and started getting used to the new experience. It didn't take long until I was utilizing multiple desktops like a boss. The Apple Keyboard's shortcuts are a huge step over anything Microsoft had offered. 

All my mac computers ran as smooth as my newer HP desktops and Sony laptop, all of which I'd purchased in the last couple of years, which is a huge testament to Apple's focus on quality and longevity. I feel like Microsoft is unable to innovate their OS in the way it needs to be, mainly because a large majority of their customers aren't super tech savvy. This is where Apple is able to be creative, because their customer base is younger, savvy individuals with creative interests. 

I will never go back to Windows for any reason, simply because there is nothing they can offer me that's better than my current Apple experience. I don't need my computer to work as a custom-designed gaming rig, or computer server, or anything other than a basic computer. 

I use my Mac Mini for photoshopping, screenwriting, and occasional dabbling into electronic music production. While all of these programs performed admirably on my PC's, the operating system itself was the final nail in the coffin for Windows. I learned how to deal with the crashing, the buggy startups, the ""blue screen of death"" (which forced me into upgrading from Windows 7 in the first place, as my hard drive was wiped thanks to a ""bug""). 

Not once have any of my Mac computers crashed and/or frozen. I occasionally experience the ""Rainbow wheel of death"", but that's only when I'm rendering MASSIVE files in Photoshop or Reaper. Two months into my Apple experience, and I can't help but believe that this is what computers were meant to be. No amount of Windows 8 updates will ever change my mind.",510.0,785,2014-01-23,AAPL,0.10767379403114319,0.8622391819953918,0.030087009072303772

I have used [MacDrive 9](http://www.mediafour.com/products/macdrive) to attempt to access it, but it did not work. I already have my entire iTunes library on it which is about 60GB, so I'd rather not format it. Also, I heard if you format it to FAT32 or anything other than Mac OS Extended Journal it could suffer in perfromance while in OSX.

iphone,Games for public transportation?,"I ran a few searches (google and reddit) and didn't find much. If this has been covered, please point me in the right direction.

Basically, I'm looking for some games that I can play while standing up on public transportation.

Must haves:

* One-handed
* Portrait orientation
* Don't require internet connection

Things that would be nice:

* don't drain the battery super quick
* no sound required
* no pay-to-play, or pop-up ads, or IAPs. I don't mind paying a few bucks for a game, but I don't want to have to constantly buy stuff for a game or be bothered to buy other stuff while I'm playing.

I like old school JRPGs like final fantasy, though I expect it'll be impossible to find something like that that meets the above requirements. I like euro-style board games. I like stuff with a little depth in one way or another.

Not the biggest fan of super simple, repetitive games like doodle jump.

apple,What is your mac time line?,I was born in 1998 so I am coming in half way. My dad was always a mac guy. He had the macintosh and other computers after that but I never used those because in 2000 he bought the family a Ruby Red iMac. I have fond memories about this computer. My dad was to cheap to buy me and my brother game consoles so he installed emulators for N64 and GameBoy right on the computer. Playing Mario Kart with some of the textures removed was great. It was my first computer and was the families computer for about 6-8 years. When the iMac was getting slow it just so happened my grandfathers iMac G5 stopped working. So my grandfather sent it down to where we live for my dad to take a look. My dad fixed the problem but my grandfather just said keep it and he will buy a new one. At this point my entire family around the world had at least one mac. We all constantly used iChat but the mac that we had didn't have a webcam. We later bought a webcam and used it for those calls but it was always a hassle. The computer started to get slow and after about a two years with that computer it began to break again so my dad went down to the apple store and bought a 2008 aluminum iMac. This computer is still with us today and my parents use it as their office computer. In late 2009-2010 I bought a macbook pro 13 inch with the money I had saved over past years. This was my first real computer. After constant use of that for about a year I bought an iPad 3rd Generation. This device showed me how my computer seemed to be very slow. The flash storage was so great I ended up almost never using my macbook. I would play games on it with friends but that was pretty much it. The thing could barley run two applications at once with out the fans exploding and that annoyed me to great lengths. So in mid 2012 when the Macbook Pro Retina 15 came out. I saved up my money again and begged my parents to help me with its pricing and I bought it. This is my current computer and I use it alongside my new iPad Air. These two devices are perfect for each other. I bring my iPad to school for notes and I come home and its already in the pages app on my mac. I guess the apple ecosystem runs in my veins. People ask me what is iCloud for and I think that even as bad as it is it is still great as a uniting service that brings together iOS and Mac.,61.0,9,2014-01-25,AAPL,0.06665433943271637,0.8998186588287354,0.033527057617902756

Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis around 1994 and since then his physical state has slowly withered away. I'm looking for a way to get him back on the computer. 

I've been researching Apple's voiceover technology, but almost all of the articles praising its merits for the blind are in reference to those with reduced vision and are capable of reading braille. Not only is my father's sight completely useless to him at this point, but he has very poor control of his right hand (he's right handed, and it shakes constantly). Thankfully, his left hand still seems to work fine. 

All that being said, how much would you all say one can do with an Ipad using only voice and one hand? I'm also interested in what could be done with two hands, as anything is possible without enough practice and hard work. 

A few specific questions:

How good is it about websurfing? 

Would it be possible to pull up a site like grooveshark or pandora and actually find what you're looking for? 

If he pulls up a wikipedia page, what would be the process for getting it to read the article instead of the table of contents or the sidebar? 



If anybody can offer any information on this, I will be extremely grateful. I don't think anything would make my dad happier than being able to surf the web and write emails again.

Problem is that I have no clue what to do and I have read multiple articles that really dont make sense to me and what I have in terms of power is still a confusing subject. I have read switching to a SSD and upgrading RAM would help and I guess thats a step, but should I also upgrade my GPU or even get some new intel Quad Core processor?

For what I can tell you, games like WoW and D3 which I used to play often would literally run my computer overboard where it could quite possibly be defined as impossible to play and as someone who is trying to get back into gaming I feel like a might want to look for some advice before doin it myself.

I often want to copy the URL of an image. However, Safari doesn't provide such a feature, so I usually have to copy the current URL, switch to Chrome, paste it, copy the image URL, and then switch back to what I was doing in Safari.

Now that I have jailbroken my iPad I thought solving this would be easy, but the only thing I have found is [**iEagleEye**](http://www.redmondpie.com/ieagleeye-a-cydia-tweak-which-extends-safari-and-mail-image-download-options/), which does exactly what I want ... but it only works on iPhone.

The built-in *Copy* option is not what I'm looking for, since it doesn't work if the image is in a link.

An *Open Image in New Tab* option would be much better than nothing.

When I did come across a film I could rent (usually every fifth search or so) the price ranged from $2.99 to $4.99.

Regardless, this is probably why Netflix is dominating the movie rental market.  For $7.99 a month a customer can watch whatever they want whenever they want and usually wherever they want.
