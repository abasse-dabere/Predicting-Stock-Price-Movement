iphone,A few lesser known settings that may improve your battery life (iOS 6),"These are some settings that I have found to have helped with my battery life on my iPhone 4S running iOS 6.1.2. These settings may not necessarily be for everyone but, hopefully, they can be of help to others with similar battery issues that the standard battery drain guides cannot resolve. 

**Disable unnecessary Notification Centre (NC) widgets.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Edit*: drag unnecessary widgets out of the 'In Notification Centre' list and into the 'Not In Notification Centre' list.

* Why: Widgets such as Calendar and Mail will frequently pull information to keep 'updated'. The fewer widgets you have, the better.

* Why Not: You are in need of constant updates from all these applications (apps).

 
**Disable 'Emergency Alerts'.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Notifications*: toggle 'Emergency Alerts' to OFF.

* Why: Essentially a form of [push notification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_Service) that has a constantly open IP connection. 

* Why Not: You require or would like to have these notifications from your service provider.

 
**Disable Siri's 'Raise to Speak'.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Siri*: toggle 'Raise to Speak' to OFF.

* Why: The raise to speak function utilizes the infrared proximity sensor to constantly check how close a surface is to the face of the phone, as well as the iPhone's accelerometers.

* Why Not: You are a frequent user of Siri and its 'Raise to Speak' feature.

 
**Disable Mobile Data/Cellular for iTunes, FaceTime, Passbook Updates, and Reading List.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Mobile Data (or 'Cellular')*: under 'Use Mobile Data for:' list, toggle 'iTunes', 'FaceTime', 'Passbook Updates', and 'Reading List' to OFF.

* Why: Your mobile data will be used for these apps or features and whenever they update in the background.

* Why Not: You require these apps to have mobile data access (as opposed to wifi).

 
**Disable automatic time zone setting.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Date &amp; Time*: toggle 'Set Automatically' to OFF.

* Why: Location services will be used to check your position on a regular basis in order to adjust the time according to the time zone you are in.

* Why Not: You frequently change time zones or require this feature.

 
**Disable unnecessary System Services that require Location Services.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Location Services -&gt; System Services* (Note: System services can only be accessed when Location Services is toggled ON): toggle any of these system services that you do not require to OFF (personally, I have left only Compass Calibration on).

* Why: These system services are not essential to the phone's basic functions but utilize Location Services which can be a strong battery drain.

* Why Not: You require or utilize these system services.


**Disable Diagnostics &amp; Usage reporting.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About -&gt; Diagnostics &amp; Usage*: select 'Don't Send'.

* Why: Whenever a crash or error report is generated, the log is automatically sent to Apple in order to help address the issue in future iOS updates, using mobile data and Location Services.

* Why Not: You wish to help Apple address crashes or instabilities in iOS.",64,435,2013-03-01,AAPL,0.053480081260204315,0.9201217293739319,0.02639816887676716

iphone,"How do I go about removing 1.8GB of ""Other"" data from my iPhone?","It's beginning to get annoying.

Of my 8GB iphone 4's 6.4GB capacity, 1.8GB of it is currently taken up by Other data. I cant figure out how to get rid of it! I have don't have too many apps as this phone is mostly for phone/text, music, and ofc redditing. 

I've tried backing up and then restoring to that backup. I've also tried something I saw on the interwebs where you go to settings/general/usage/music and slide across ""all music"" and then reboot the iphone. This worked at first, but then I noticed that when I went to play music, the iphone would constantly skip tracks and be unable to play music itself.

Any help would be appreciated. That 1.8GB of other data is taking up precious space for my music! D:

Going through my old photos from when I worked in Apple retail years ago and came across this gem, the kid's table piss ball.  I had almost forgotten that little tidbit of knowledge I had learned from the job.  Apparently when kids are really into a game they will often choose to just pee in their seat without stopping what they're doing.  The result?  Squishy black ball seats.  I had never really believed that kids would do this until I walked by while they were retiring one of the balls one night.

ipad,How do you use your iPad? (need inspirations!),"I'm a college student who recently purchased the iPad 2. So far, I have been using the iPad for mostly:

-Note taking (iAnnotate)

-Reddit (Alien Blue)

-Surfing the web (Chrome/Safari)

-Facebook/Twitter

-Sports updates (ESPN ScoreCenter, Bleacher Report Team Stream)

-Reading (Flipboard, GQ mag subscription)

-Games (Plants vs Zombies, etc)


However, I really think I could get more out of using this iPad! For all other iPad users out there, what are some of the apps and functions you utilize that some of us don't?

iphone,I've been scammed hard and I feel dumb,"So here's my story: I went on a business trip to Budapest for a couple of days. On the night of the last day (I had my return flight early the next morning) I went to a pub to have a couple of beers and to unwind a bit. 

In the pub I start chatting with a small group of locals, and I end up at their table drinking a beer and having a pleasant time. One of the guys starts telling the group that he won an iPhone 4s at a local lottery that they all seemed to know, and that he received it that same day, and he had it there to show it to the others. 

He says that he doesn't need it and that he's going to sell it because he is tight on cash. He shows it to me (I think you all know where this is going) and asks me if I'm interested in buying it. He says that since he needs the cash and that he got it basically for free, he could give it to me for an incredible price. I take a look at it, and having never seen an IPhone up close in my life (I have always been more of an android guy) it seems perfectly legit. I try to turn it on, but after a couple of seconds it says that the battery is low and shuts down. I have just the time to catch a glimpse of the start screen, move the slider and see the usual (or so I thought) icons. I notice the usual stuff (google maps, the app store, youtube etc.) and one app (talking tom) which I also have on my android phone. The phone was complete with the ""original"" box, charger, earbuds etc.

But as soon as I try to launch something the battery dies. In retrospect, I should of course have plugged in the charger and taken a better look, but I was tired and on my third beer so my dumb self was convinced I was having a lucky break. 

The guy offered to sell it to me for 200€. I negotiated a bit and got it for 180€.

Today I took a better look at it, and of course it's a Chinese clone in an iPhone 4s enclosure. It's barely usable for making phone calls and apparently it connects to my home wifi, but that's about it. Of course Itunes on my mac simply ignores it, and it is overall a piece of shit of a phone.

I'm sharing this because I feel so dumb, and maybe because it might prevent others from being scammed like I was. That is, if there's anyone else on this planet as dumb as I am.",46,68,2013-03-12,AAPL,0.03351856768131256,0.9255519509315491,0.040929436683654785

iphone,Is Mailbox a security risk or not?,"There's been so much hoopla over this, I can't find a straight answer, and I'm genuinely curious. There have been two popular posts in the last few weeks regarding the security of the new app called Mailbox, and there seems to be people arguing the same points on both sides. The answer shouldn't be that hard.


Not that there are pro's and con's, but that nobody can even agree on the technical facts. So what's the deal? How does the security of Mailbox compare to that of the native mail client? Mailbox's UI is pissing me off anway (deleted my preset lists for it's own) and if there is a flaw in its security design, I'm just going back to native.


Here is the big question. If Mailbox's servers were compromised, could the attackers (or employees) have access to gmail passwords, or emails themselves? What about with the native mail app? (doesn't native store credentials locally?) I don't care about conjectures or theories, I want devs who know what they are talking about to answer this question, please!


*Just because other clients have the same flaws, or problems, etc doesn't matter. They aren't the question. The question is Mailbox and the native ios mail client.

Basically, we'll have tips and suggestions for using the app and putting things together, as well as general information and sharing of people's projects and ideas.

I'm putting this up on a few different subreddits, in the hopes of finding more people interested in subscribing to read and post links, as well as possibly more people to help out with the subreddit (if we have enough subscribers for that to be a thing).

apple,"It has always been one of my dreams to work for apple and to eventually start my own computer company like apple, so I emailed Ronald Wayne about his experience and for advice. Here's my email and his reply.","My email:

Hello Mr. Wayne,

My name is (name deleted for privacy), and I'm currently a senior in high school about
to graduate and begin the first steps of adulthood. I've read as much as I
could about who you are, and it's nothing short of amazing. All I seek is
advice, and your wisdom about the world and your experience working with
Steve Jobs and Wozniak. My dream is to go off and start the next major
computer company and industry. I have a vision of the truly personal
computer. As of now, the company is between my friend and me. I have always
been around computers since my birth in 1995. I took it apart for the first
time when I was 6 years old and was able to successfully put it together. At
11 years old, I coded my very own private server for a video game my friends
and I were playing. I was able to get my entire grade at the time to join my
private server and stop playing the real game. I modified exp rates, drop
rates, and even the maps using C++. (This was all self taught) At 13 or 14
years old, I was able to land my first job as a sales clerk at a local Dunkin
Donuts, and was able to begin exploring my interests in computers even more.
I built my first computer that year, and I don't think I was even in high
school yet. I've done the same multiple times for friends and family who
wished to have similar builds. I have even made a small business doing this.
I remember having friends give me their iPods over night so I can jailbreak
it, (before it was a 1 step process) and giving it back to them in the
morning. They would frequently brick it and I was plagued with having to fix
their iPods. I have built servers, coded, and hacked.
My passion for technology has become something that I can no longer ignore. I
want to actually create and bring the world into the next generation of
technology. All I ask Mr. Wayne, is for an email or some sort of reply
explaining your experience and expertise in working in the field and working
with arguably the greatest minds of our generation. I seek advice on how to
start, or even a word of caution. I appreciate the time if you decide to
write back let alone read this message. If you really want to make a young
man happy, my phone number is ### ### #### and I would love to have the
opportunity to talk to a man of your stature. Thank you.


His reply: (what really made me happy was his response was longer than mine) 

Dear Mr. sneak156;
    Thank you for your email.  From it I conclude that you've had quite a level of achievement in your own right.  I expect that my reply, however, might be something of a disappointment, since to be perfectly candid, your knowledge and expertise in the world of computers seems to far exceed my own.  And while, I was a self-taught engineer in the world of electro-mechanical product development, that method of learning proved to be an overly demanding way to acquire my skills. But while my coincident need to earn a living had limited my opportunity for a formal education, ""self-taught"" is not an approach that I’d recommend to anyone else - particularly in today’s world of rapidly expanding technology. My own lack of formal instruction tended to leave gaps in my working knowledge which sometimes made the conduct of my work more difficult than it had to be. And though I became sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable to gain full employment throughout my half-century-long career (which concluded with a sixteen-year stint as Chief Engineer with an electronics firm in California), that knowledge and ability came more slowly than it really should have. In fact, as a curious point, I think I was seven years old before I discovered that grapefruit didn’t grow in a can. It’s true that I was self-taught in electronics from the days of vacuum tubes.  And as the technology expanded, I also taught myself transistor circuitry and both TTL and CMOS integrated circuit and logic design, but did not advance into microprocessors or software development. It is probable, therefore, that if I’d driven myself to gain a formal education, even while I was employed, my career would most-likely have been far more successful - at least within the conventional definition of that term. In fact, what I’m saying is, ""Learn from the mistakes of others, since you may not live long enough to make them all yourself"".
    There is this added appreciation, however. If I had taken that course, instead of simply following every adventurous whim that took my fancy, my entire life would surely have changed, which means that I would almost certainly not have joined Atari at the exact point in time when Mr. Jobs was there, and my whole involvement with the origins of Apple would likely never have happened. In short, we are each of us the total product and result of all of the choices and experiences of our life times - and the alteration of any one of which, could well lead to a totally different outcome. Over the years I have become ""an expert"" - but only in the context of the definition of that term by Niels Bohr - as someone who’d made every possible mistake, in a very narrow field. In short what I’m suggesting, is that with your level of drive, knowledge and experience, at such an early age, you will be cheating yourself and your future if you don’t now take the time and opportunity to expand your formal education, no matter what the demand may be on your energy and resources.
    As another piece of advice, for whatever its worth, to ""seek a niche"" in some corner of today’s computer world might work out well for you - or your choice of that approach might well be cheating yourself of some truly monumental experience and achievement.  What I mean is, that it’s fine to proceed along the path that you currently envision for yourself, but in the process, I encourage you to be watchful for any truly unique opportunity, even one which might seem to diverge from your chosen path.  Such watchfulness might lead to an entirely new field of product or concept, which in itself could change your future, and the world’s as well.
    Finally, monumental achievement frequently invites monumental risk. In the realm of risk, I myself have adopted to principles. First, always weight what you have to gain, against what you might lose.  Second. Never risk everything - unless you have absolute control over the outcome of the game.
    I hope the forgoing comments will be helpful. And if you’d like to discuss these or any other subjects in the future, you can reach me directly at ### ### ####, or via email at (insert email here).
    Once again, thank you for the honor of your message, and very best regards,
    Ron Wayne",15,201,2013-03-30,AAPL,0.040288977324962616,0.9207593202590942,0.03895169869065285

ipad,GamePress - Make Games on your iPad [Xpost r/gamedev],"Hey Guys. I posted about this a few week ago.
Based on the feedback we received we made a new trailer video. I think this one does a better job of showing GamePress and its features.

Video can be seen at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZUNhviJLr8 or at www.gamepressapp.com

Just a quick Rundown of what GamePress is:

GamePress is an iPad app that allows anyone to easily make games and share them with friends and family with no programming abilities.

With our robust behaviour system you can create a wide range of genres, so theres really no limit to your imagination.

Some features include:

* Easy to use level editor so you can easily build your worlds and place objects

* Behaviour editor which replaces programming. Works like a flowchart of actions and events

* Complete physics engine (powered by Box2D)

* Particle Editor so you can quickly whip up some awesome particles
* Sound Effects creator so you can make some custom sound effects
* Thousands of included art assets to get you started on making your games
* Ability to import your own graphics, music, or sound effects
* Special effects like shaders, and tweening.

Our plan is to launch end of April 2013.
We would love to hear your thoughts, feedback or suggestions.
