iphone,So I just moved from iPhone 4 to Samsung Galaxy S3...,"I have had iPhones since the 3 and my wife and I trade off upgrades. In other words, she has a 4s and I had a 4 - it was my turn to upgrade when the 5 came out!

I love 99% of the iPhone experience, but the screen has been killing me, I NEED a bigger screen. I had already changed accessibility settings and the fonts were starting to look stupid. I was really hoping for a Galaxy S3 sized iPhone 5...

Needless to say, I was very disappointed when the news was released on the Apple version of making the screen larger. That wasn't what I was looking for when I meant larger.

So... I did some playing and had just about decided on the Note 2 when it came out, and an opportunity came up to get a Galaxy S3 through my work.

Here is what I am finding.

1. PATENT LAWS SUCK. Everything is slightly different. Just enough to not be exactly the same, and just enough to require a complete relearn of the smartphone experience.

2.  The larger screen is AMAZING. The Galaxy is truly a beautiful visual experience. 

3. Interestingly, even though the screen is awesome, side by side, the iPhone has a MUCH brighter, whiter, white. The Samsung has a very cool blue tint. You would never know unless you compare them side by side.

4. The iPhone feels way higher quality. The screen feels thicker, and it just feels nicer.

5. The iPhone is LIGHT years ahead on e-mail. It is ALMOST a deal breaker just how bad android email really is - but I am learning that there are apps that bridge the gap somewhat. I have completely given up on having all my email accounts in one app now and the email app I am leaning towards cost $20! That's enough to basically make the phone just $20 more expensive!

6. I thought texting was horrible, but I'm finding apps that bridge this gap that are inexpensive (free in many cases) that let me load an iPhone theme and almost look/act the same.

7. I'm finding apps are the only thing making android usable. For instance, the keyboard is TERRIBLE. I downloaded SwiftKey and it is simply amazing. The simple keyboard app takes the android typing experience from being way worse than the iPhone and makes it way better than the iPhone.

8. Notifications are terrible. iOS has this down beautifully. I know when I have a text, email, voicemail, phone call and more. With the Samsung, it makes all kinds of noises and gurgles that are meaningless to me right now. I'm sure with some work I will get it fixed, but out of the box it is bad.

9. Editing is a mixed bag. I LOVE the cursor and ability to move the cursor around text easily. Way better than iPhone and I suspect iPhone doesn't have this because of patent issues. On the other hand, things like ""select all"" are not obvious to me.

10. Android isn't intuitive. Apple wins hands down here. I'm constantly staring at my screen wondering, ""how the eff do I send that email"" or ""how do I make the keyboard go back down and get out of my way?"" Lots of things have weird symbols and I have no idea how to tell what to do! It is very frustrating.

11. Most everything you do on Android is a workaround or overly difficult, non-intuitive chore. For instance, if you want to make a folder on a ""home screen"" on iPhone, you drag one icon on top of another and name the newly created folder. With Android, you press and hold a blank spot on the home screen, then select edit and add folder and then you can put stuff in the folder and edit the name of the folder. I didn't even realize it HAD folders and ended up buying a $1.50 app that let me do custom folders (with more visual options) before I learned that you could do plain ones for free.

12. Visually, Android is stunning and hugely customizable. If you have to trick out your workspace, it is for you.

13. Battery life is atrocious. I thought iPhone was bad, I bet I get HALF the life out of the S3! I will either need an extra battery or one of the thicker 4,000+ maH batteries, but I already bought a Seidio Holster/Case so that isn't a great option. I end up charging in the afternoon!

14. The app stores are very close in having all the same apps you NEED. I was afraid I wouldn't have all my favorite apps from the iPhone, but they are in the play store. Maybe not as many fart apps, but the important stuff is there. I DO like that I don't have to enter my frigging password every time I download a FREE app. Drives me crazy that the apple App Store makes me enter my p/w for a free app.

I'm sure that I have a lot to learn, I've only had the Galaxy S3 a few days (about 4 days) but those are my first I impressions.

If someone were to ask me if they should switch from iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S3, I would say, ""If you are happy with the iPhone - stay with the iPhone. If you are unhappy with the iPhone, stay with the iPhone. If you are unhappy with the iPhone screen size, then consider the Samsung Galaxy S3 or perhaps even the Samsung Note 2 but be ready for some things you aren't going to like as well as the iPhone!""

To Apple's credit, the overall user experience is far better and far more polished than Android. Android is catching up, but IMPORTANT apps like email just aren't there and honestly, WHY? Why isn't email as good as Apple by now? I get emails that do not fit on screen, I can barely tell what is read and what isn't. I had to download touchdown HD to get a decent exchange app and it cost $20. Gmail is terrible. Most Android mail options are NOT push... It is really poor. And that is a shame because email is a make-it-or-break-it app!

On the other hand, why can't apple offer a larger sized iPhone? They lost me because of that and I REALLY didn't want to leave.

Feel free to ask questions and I'll tell you what I can...

ipad,An iPad Mini Review by a Casual iPad Lover,"WARNING: LONG POST AHEAD.

**TL;DR: I love my new iPad. I think it's perfect for the causal tablet user. Reasons below.**


In the interest of full disclosure, I should tell you that I am writing this review from my brand new iPad mini. I have been in possession of this device for slightly more than twelve hours; still, I feel compelled to write a review of my initial, genuine reactions to my new favorite gadget.

I have, in preparation for launch day, read scads of professionals’ reviews, from scathing to glowing. I’ve read up on the product specs, even though pixel counts mean virtually nothing to me as a newbie to the tablet world. I even google searched “best iPad apps” and made meticulous lists as to which apps I would download for my new device once I got my hands on it.This morning, I awoke early (no small feat for a college student) and drove out to my local Best Buy. I waited patiently for an available sales representative and declared my desire for a 16GB white iPad mini. I stood awkwardly in the store front as he went to go get one from the back - and then.

There it was, as pristinely packaged as all of the other Apple products that I have ever purchased.The iconic white box with its minimalistic sans serif font made me want to rip it open right there in the store - luckily, I had the restraint not to. I paid the $329 plus tax - a somewhat steep price for an 8” tablet - and proudly carried my purchase home in its blue plastic bag.

After arriving home and figuring out how to set up the charger (yes, I actually had trouble plugging it in), I went about my day, attending class as I let the little thing do its charging. After class, I could hardly contain my excitement as I walked back to my dorm with some friends; I knew it would be done charging.

Sure enough, when I clicked the power button, the battery bar read 100%. Excited, I unplugged it and got to work configuring the settings and downloading apps. I happily spent the rest of my morning and a good portion of my afternoon toying with the device. I played games on it, listened to some radio, and experimented with the note taking apps. I carried it with me to and fro, holding it one-handedly as I strode across campus or laid in bed.

I think it’s safe to say that I was bitten by the iPad bug: my first tablet, and I’m already obsessed with it.

Fan-girling aside, however, the iPad mini holds it own, even for the non-starstruck. At just under 8” (7.9”, to be exact), the iPad mini is the perfect size for a student like me: small enough to function as an e-reader, but large enough to use to surf Facebook when procrastinating on a paper. It lacks the near-laptop feel of my brother’s full-sized iPad 2, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. At this size, the mini allows or ease of handling when strolling through campus or sprawling supine on the couch. It is also lightweight enough to allow for this one-handed ease of hefting, which is a particularly nice bonus for students with heavy textbooks.

As for the screen, which has been the biggest complaint that I have heard, there is no problem. While I don’t doubt that a lower pixel count and lack of Retina display is a deal breaker for some, I haven’t found it to cause any issues. As a first time iPad user, I don’t know the difference, and think the screen crisp and clear enough for all of my reading, gaming, and video-watching needs.

Of much more concern to me, in fact, was the keyboard. I worried that, on such a small screen, the keyboard would be unnavigable, which would be a major drawback for an avid typist such as myself. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to find the portrait-orientation to be the perfect size for two-thumb typing, which I have quickly grown to love. (As mentioned, I am writing this review on the iPad in question.) The landscape-orientation keyboard leaves something to be desired in terms of ease of navigability, being ever-so-slightly too wide for my thumbs to cover, but that is hardly a deal-breaker with the more convenient portrait-orientation keyboard. If a full keyboard that will allow you to rest all eight fingers on the home keys is what you desire, however, it’s likely that this is not the tablet that you are looking for.

And then, of course, we have the functionality. As an owner of a MacBook, I am comfortable with the Apple interface, though I found my laptop took some getting used to. Not so with the iPad. The layout is clean and intuitive, allowing me to very quickly organize and set up my device. I adjusted immediately to the ins- and-outs of the interface, grabbing and dragging apps and playing around with settings. As for the functionality of the mini as compared to other models, I can only speak based on brief experience with my brother’s iPad 2, but the experience does indeed seem to be the”full iPad experience” that Apple so proudly touted. Each and every one of the myriad of apps that I installed runs quickly and smoothly, seeming well adapted to my device.

Other salient points of the design include aesthetic value - the iPad mini is cute. My model is the white-and-aluminum option, and I’m not the only one who finds it overwhelmingly appealing. Already, I have received many compliments as to how “adorable” or “attractive” my mini is, and it’s only the first day that I’ve had it. The battery life is also nothing to scoff at: although I can’t speak for the long term, I can say that I have been using this little bugger almost constantly all day, and it’s yet to give out on me.

Finally, some would say that you should just spare the extra few bucks and take the plunge with a full sized iPad, but I disagree. The mini has its own advantages that make it more than just a shrunk down iPad. It’s in its own market, the market of the mid sized tablets, and rightfully so. And while the price might be exorbitant, I would be willing to argue that if you are looking for the iPad experience, then it is worth the incremental cost.

All in all, I think it’s safe to say that I am pro-iPad mini, for these reasons and more. And while I may just be a layperson goofing around joyfully on her first tablet, I like to think that my opinion matters as far as laypeople go - because that’s going to be a large section, if not the majority, of the market for the iPad mini. Not your tech gurus, but your everyday Dick and Jane, looking to add a functional, fun tablet to their lives. And I think that, with the iPad mini, Dick and Jane will like what they see.",59,112,2012-11-03,AAPL,0.03607842139899731,0.9210174083709717,0.04290413483977318

apple,"I just removed my optical drive and replaced it with a SDD and added 16GB RAM to my MacBook Pro. This thing is now a ROCKET! If you haven't done this yet, I highly recommend you do!","Sure, not everyone needs to do this, but if you want to feel like you're working on a machine that is beyond what's available today in terms of performance, stability, and beauty, then take out that old optical drive (and put it into an external enclosure) and replace it with a solid-state drive. Personally, I took the hard drive out and put it into the drive expander and put the solid-state drive into the spot with the hard drive was, and added the 16GB RAM and I can't believe this is the same machine. I could never go back!

What amazed me most of all, however, was just how simple Apple made it for this to happen. I've done lots of PC upgrades, and I've NEVER had any upgrade go this easily! I literally just had to clone the HDD to the SDD, tell the computer to boot from the SDD from now on, and reboot. Done! It was amazing! There are lots and lots of articles and videos on Youtube to show how to do it. It's not scary or difficult at all. To be honest, it's even easier to do than the videos make it appear.

Like I said in the title; I highly recommend you do this. The prices for RAM and SDD's are so low now, that if you want the ultimate performance, it's an easy way to get it.

I am, as you all probably are, an avid iPhone user. I love learning new, cool things that I can do with this wonderful phone, should that be with the default OS, Jailbreaks, apps, etc.

I find that this sub-reddit has been getting worse and worse over the past couple of weeks. Almost every post is about a small glitch, a hardware issue, and things that you could easily look up for yourself. This is a drag.

This sub-reddit should take a turn for the better. Focusing more on this as mentioned in the first paragraph and less on the things as mentioned in the second.

apple,passcode to power down? would've been helpful in my recent mugging,"find my iphone is a great feature, but it's gotten to the point where thieves and muggers are aware of it, and can immediately power down a device. a passcode to power down would be so helpful, i really hope it's something apple implements. 

i was recently mugged at gunpoint, and lost my phone in the incident. i was talking to the cops within 15 minutes, but the device was already powered down. man, it would have been so clutch in the situation. the cops even told me how great they think that app is (getting my phone back is a plus for me, finding criminals is a plus for cops).

Ignore those comments. All I know is that rather than clicking on the network when it is auto detected, if you enter it manually underneath ""other"", that fixed the problem for us. Also a lot of people here are posting their own solutions which is of course welcome. Hopefully this thread helps most people having wifi issues. 

I have a netgear router, I will update this with the exact model when I get home

.............................


It was pretty simple actually, but first, some background.

We both have the iPhone 4S. We reset network settings, reset all settings, restored from backup, set up as a new iPhone, *went to the Apple store and got a new iPhone,* thinking it was a hardware failure (since mine stayed connected to the same wireless router and his kept disconnecting), updated the firmware to the router, did a hard reset to the router, changed various settings/encryption type. Nothing worked. His kept disconnecting and mine would stay connected just fine. Finally, believe it or not, it ended up being to simply enter the network manually. Settings&gt;Wi-Fi&gt;Other. I didn't see this solution posted anywhere else so I figured I would share. You'd never think it was something that simple, right?...",32,39,2012-11-13,AAPL,0.06512819230556488,0.8969691395759583,0.03790261968970299

iphone,Amazon.com's iPhone Trade In Program is a Scam,"FINAL UPDATE - Received a call from Amazon Executive Customer Relations and they have offered to reimburse me the full price of the trade in value I was expecting. I appreciate Amazon's response here and think its important you read this first as they have made an effort to satisfy me as a customer.
----
Just sent off an iPhone 4 8GB in almost brand new condition. I packaged the item in a new iPhone 4 Box, with charger, cables, headphones and packaging. Cables, Packaging and Headphones were new from new iPhone. I chose to use Amazon since I assumed they were a reputable business. When choosing the trade in you choose a range. I chose 'Like New' condition with the assumption that it would at the very least get a 'Good' condition rating. Like new is $187 - Good is $157. Not a great price, but good enough for me. The mistake I made was to choose the option to not return it and accept the appraised value if it does not meet your original appraisal. I did this because I knew there was no way it would be appraised lower than the $157 'Good' condition rating.

Several days later I get a rating of 'Heavily Scratched' and a gift card for $80 with no way to challenge the appraisal. I called Customer Service, yet they told me there is nothing they can do.

I'll eat this one, but I just got scammed. Don't make this mistake. The iPhone logic board is $100 + depending on the model.

Update 1: I am on the phone now with Amazon customer service and have asked for the number of the 3rd Party who took the iPhone. They still are saying the same thing that by electing not to have my phone shipped back to me that I have agreed to whatever price they provide, however, I haven't agreed on any price. For these terms, the buyer can give any price they wish and the customer has no option but to accept it. That is unreasonable giving them the option to low ball you knowing there is nothing you can do.

Update 2: Now Amazon is telling me it was not a 3rd Party, but Amazon who took the phone.

Update 3: Customer Service claims there is no manager that is available for me to speak with, but that I can call back but to be reassured there is nothing they are can/willing to do. At the very least, from an IT Director who spends a lot of money at Amazon I deserve an opportunity to speak with a manager. I chose Amazon because I didn't want the hassle of eBay or Craigslist. I just wanted a quick sale to use the money for my kids Christmas presents. It is what it is, but for those that choose to use this method, choose to have it shipped back. I allowed them the opportunity to low ball me because I trusted I would get a fair price. I was wrong. 

I will no longer allow my employees in this state agency to buy from Amazon because of my customer service experience. Thanks for the advice and comments.",132,343,2012-11-15,AAPL,0.03526032343506813,0.9267523288726807,0.0379873551428318

We pick and choose out content without being bombarded with crap ads. But is the current offering on the Apple TV enough? Are they going in the right direction? What else could they or should they do?

The kids and I use the Apple TV as our main source of media consumption in the living room. We stream shows and movies from Netflix or our iTunes library (all ripped movies, nothing rented or bought digitally). Podcasts are a great addition as well. Youtube isn't too bad either. Airplay is wonderful but could use some tweaking.  

I personally will fork over money for Netflix or an Apple equivalent streaming service if/when it becomes available. A free ad supported model would be great also. Just think of the ad revenue from streaming a blockbuster show over the Apple TV with a few ads here and there. It works for many years for over OTA tv, why couldn't it work now for and Apple streaming service? Paying per app for sports or renting individual movies or shows just doesn't appeal to me as a consumer.

apple,DAE think that the iPod touch is now really badly priced when compared to the iPad Mini?,"In the UK an iPad Mini costs £269 and an iPod Touch costs £249. 
This seems crazy regardless of which way you want to look at it.  I appreciate that some will point to the iPod Touch having more hard drive space and, I think, a faster processor but if I was a kid this Christmas and my parents bought me a touch instead of a mini I would be gutted!  What do you lovely people think?

 Also before you say it, yes it is cheaper regardless in America but methinks the difference is somewhat similar in funny money too.  

Edit: The other way of looking at it is that the iPod is pretty cheap/ iPhone is horrifically expensive as in the UK the iPod is £249 and the iPhone is £529!
I think the Mini has just put a spanner in the works for me as now I've had a play with one I feel like although I wouldn't jog with it, I would accommodate in more places than I would previously have with the full-sized iPad. It's definitely made a nice entry point for people getting into the Apple ecosystem.",71,118,2012-11-17,AAPL,0.021027162671089172,0.8726516366004944,0.10632126778364182

iphone,All iPhone tricks in one posting,"&gt;We are coming from: http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/13cv4k/what_is_the_least_commonly_known_iphone_tiptrick/#

1. Tapping comments and stories in Alien Blue with 2 fingers gives up votes, 3 fingers give downvotes. 

2. Another AlienBlue tip: Two finger swipe from left to right on a comment will give you that comment's full thread of replies. 

3. Tapping ""123"" then tapping the character you want then finally clicking back to the main keyboard can be a hassle. Instead hold down ""123"", slide thumb to character you want to use then let go. The character will be inputted and your keyboard will be back to normal.

4. Tapping the clock/top bar on a page will take you quickly to the top.

5. Tap chunk of text w/ 2 fingers to highlight the whole thing. Works only when commenting/editing etc.

6. **Be careful, actually there is no proofed solution to turn this off again!**
If you go into the phone app, and dial \*3001#12345#*
and hit call, the ""Field Test"" application opens, which allows you to see the numerical value of your cellular reception, along with other information about the surrounding cell towers. In addition, if you hold down the power button until the ""Slide to power down"" slider comes up and then hold down the home button until the app exits, you can tap on the carrier name in the top left corner to change between the numerical value and the visual representation (in bars) without going into ""Field Test"" mode. 
&gt;The values are always negative. In my experience, around -50 is pretty much the best reception possible, while about -120 is the lowest you can go without losing reception.
Anything above -80 is good, and would be considered full bars
Anything below -100 is bad, and would be considered few bars

7. Double click the upper case arrow to set caps lock

8. Force close a single app by holding the power button until the slide to power off slider appears, then press and hold the home screen button. It will close any app that you are in and also remove it from the RAM, forcing it to completely reload upon re-opening. Fixes many problems. 

9. This may have been obvious but you can zoom in and out in the default Camera app by using two fingers to pinch and spread.

10. You can use more than a 4 digit PIN number. By turning off ""Simple Password"" and choosing only numbers instead and NO letters. You will get a number keypad to unlock the phone instead of a full keyboard. And you can use as many numbers as you would like and you you have to press OK to enter it. This makes your PIN number much much harder to guess. Since you would need to not only guess the number but also how many digits the pin contains to break in.

11. Swipe away banner notifications that inhibit you pressing a button on the top of the screen by swiping from RIGHT TO LEFT (will not work L TO R).

12. In Mail, holding the ""New Email"" button will display all your recent drafts. 

13. Tapping the screen with two fingers while in Maps will zoom out

14. Add a shortcut for your email address (example @@). It makes filling in online forms much, much easier. 
&gt;Settings &gt; general &gt; keyboard &gt; shortcuts

15. Put a tracking number for UPS or some other mail services in a text field (notes, e-mail, text) and it becomes a link to the tracking website. 

16. To continue listening to a video or music video from safari after exiting safari, just double click the home button, go to music controls, and press play. Also works on the lock screen, useful for music videos, etc. 

17. A lot of people didn't notice the Emoji inclusion in iOS6. Under General-&gt;International-&gt;Keyboards-&gt;Add new keyboard. Then when you're sending a text, there is a new button that appears that let's you switch between keyboard layouts, so pop into the Emoji keyboard to add those silly things, and hit the keyboard button to switch back to a regular keyboard.

18. Sleep Timer - While playing music in the Music App , toggle to the clock app click timer, click ""when timer ends"", scroll to bottom, click stop playing. Start Timer.

19. Pressing the volume buttons when alarm clock goes off for the snooze. I've caught myself accidentally turning it off instead of pressing the snooze button and find this method much safer and easier.

20. If you turn on accessibility settings you can tap out a custom vibration pattern or make the bright camera LED flash when you get a call or text. Then go into contacts, hit Edit and you can select the vibration below the ring tone. On IOS6, the custom vibration settings have moved to Settings &gt; Sounds. You click on each individual alert type and you have to option to set a custom vibration.

21. If you're getting a call you can just press the lock button to mute it instead of pressing decline. Pretty useful for when your phone starts blasting in your pocket during a class or meeting! Works also with the volume keys.

22. Holding the keyboard globe icon gives you a list of keyboards that are on.

23. Swipe from leftmost of screen to right in camera to access the camera roll instead of clicking it from the bottom. 

24. In camera app, use the volume buttons as a picture clicker.

25. Press the home button and lock button to take a screenshot

26. To reset the new message counter. Lets say you have a bunch of unread emails and you don't want to click through all of them. Click edit, select the first message, hold down the Mark button and click the same message to unselect it. Voila! All the messages are selected! Click Mark as unread.

27. When websites have embedded content that scrolls (like an extra area with scrollbars), you can use 2 fingers to navigate through it. This works with textareas for example.

28. When your is screen off or the phone is locked while listening to music or just audio in general: Double Tap home button to bring up iPod controls to Pause/Stop or skip. Also works to resume last playing audio track whether native or 3 party. 

29. You don't have to swipe the homescreen to go to the next, you can simply tap the left corner/right corner right above the first and forth icons on the dashboard. See screenies: http://i.imgur.com/zNR0M.png

30. Here's for the lazy ones: end a phone conversation by pressing the lock button. This way, you can terminate the call and locking the screen in one press. 

31. If you want to search for a word on a page with safari, enter it in the web search box on the top right and scroll all the way down, past the suggestions until it says 'on this page'. 

32. You can use rich text styling in the mail app. Select some text and bring up the context menu, then press the arrow right. You can use bold, italics, underline, and indenting.

33. *#06# displays your iPhone's IMEI. Good to take down if you don't have the original box around you. You'll need the IMEI if your phone gets stolen or dislocated, in order to file a report with the police and/or a claim with the insurance company.

That leaves the Clouded Leopard as the only big cat Apple hasn't used (and hasn't leopard been used enough already?). Seeing as they have already used the Cheetah, we can assume that opens up Felinae for use, perhaps Lynx, Bobcat, Ocelot, Cougar (I know, Pumas and Mountain Lions are already up there) and Caracel. I'm not sure that OS X Jaguarundi really has the right ring to it.

I figure this means that it won't be long before Apple must start looking beyond Panthera and Felinae for OS X names. I'm leaning towards Machairodontinae next. By my estimates, sometime around 2018 we'll be loading up [OS X Smilodon](

iphone,An ex-Android User's Thoughts on the iPhone 5,"So I recently purchased an iPhone 5 after using android for the past 3-4 years, and would like to share my thoughts and opinions for those who are curious about making the switch.

First off, this is only the second Apple device I have owned, the first being an iPod Touch 2g.  Prior to owning the 5 I had a T-Mobile myTouch 3g (awful, awful phone) and most recently an HTC HD2, a fantastic device (natively a windows phone, but I had been running the most recent Android Jellybean release on it).  My primary reason for dropping Android and switching to the 5 was because of the incredible functionality and reliability that I had experienced with my iPod. With the cost of owning a cell phone these days, I also wanted a phone that would surely be worth the monthly expenses, and I decided that the iPhone 5 was indeed that phone.

So far, I have owned the phone for just over a week.  To some this may not seem like a long time, but I have explored all of the features of the phone inside and out, and I think I have spent enough time with it to form some initial opinions.

TL;DR: The iPhone 5 is a remarkable machine that, in my opinion, represents the peak of technological mobile design and innovation.  Granted, there are many similarities in iOS that are identical to when I had first used it a few years ago, but this is in part what makes the phone so great.

Now, for the longer review:

First, I'll start with the hardware and physical design of the phone:

1. Physical Design

The physical look and feel of the iPhone 5 was largely why I chose it over the SIII or the 920.  Though the screen is clearly the smallest of the three, I had not yet owned a phone with the magazine-sharp resolution of the retina display, and I have actually been impressed with the screen size improvement over the 4s; when comparing both the 5 and 4s side-by-side, the 5 seems like a huge improvement.  Naturally, I purchased the matte black color because it looks incredibly streamlined; the matte aluminum backing and surrounding black frame makes the phone look incredibly simplistic and natural, yet futuristic at the same time.  Not having used an iPhone before, the vibrate switch is simply brilliant and I find it hard to believe this has not been replicated on another smartphone before (granted, Apple would probably file a lawsuit :D).  Not having any stick-out cameras is a godsend, and the thin, light feel of the phone only enhances its appeal.  Granted, I did not think I would like how light the phone was at first, since I am a fan of tactility and being able to feel the weight in my gadgets.  However, the weight does not bother me at all and the phone does not feel artificial in the slightest, as I feared the SIII would with its polycarbonate design. 
 
Now, moving on to the lightning dock.....though it seems many are complaining about this feature the most, I find it one of the most convenient changes with the new phone.  The connector is now reversible, which is very convenient.  The feel of the dock is also much better, as it firmly snaps into place and doesnt budge.  I have no complaints with the new redesigned dock.

Now, the only fault I have found with the physical design is that the power button and volume rockers are placed loosely within the phone, and you can hear them shaking if you tap the case when the phone is inside or shake it up against your ear.  I wasn't sure if this was just a defect with my unit, but I checked my brothers 5 and it was the same story; also checked my parent's 4s's and they both shared this same fault; I am not sure if the phones arrive like this, because I don't think I noticed it when I first got my phone, and maybe it is an onset of continuous use.  However, it does not affect the normal operation of the phone, and therefore is not that big of a complaint.

2. Software

Moving on to the software.  I have been running iOS 6 (obviously), and have had an all-around great time using it.  Yes, I can acknowledge that iOS is dated and -hopefully- will be redesigned following the management shakeup at Apple.  However, it is a very, very functional and useful operating system, which is why I believe it has been so successful.  

As I said before, cell phone data plans are very expensive, and it is important to purchase a phone that has the capacity to process the data properly and give you your moneys worth of use at the end of the month.  Switching from an android device, I can successfully say that the 5 achieves this beautifully.  Though I believe Android recently surpassed Apple in the number of apps on their store, I still firmly believe that Apple's app store is much more profound and reliable than Androids, which is often filled with spam apps and useless junk, which makes it more difficult to search.  

The iPhone 5 does everything that you would expect it to do, and it does it all very well.  The camera is amazing, there is an incredibly wide selection of unique apps, messaging works flawlessly (iMessaging is remarkable, though it is similar to Gtalk; group texts are also very streamlined).  Call quality is fine.  Very wide selection of ringtones and vibrate patterns, I have no complaints there.  From a phone perspective, the 5 is -obviously- a stout contender.

Now, when you start to use the phone more as you would a ""computer"", is where the magic really shines.  This phone is......ridiculously fast.  The first day I was using it, I did not turn on wifi...and I burned through half a gig of data (with only a single bar of 4g from my location).  This can present a problem to users (like me) who do not have unlimited data plans; however, there are easy ways to remedy this.  Turning off cellular data when you are on wifi is an easy fix; you can also use apps such as Onavo Count and Onavo Extend, which connect you to a 3rd party VPN tunnel to better filter your data and reduce your usage.  DataWiz is also a very useful quick snapshot of how much data you are consuming, as it breaks down your usage by day, week, and month.

I live in the Pacific Northwest, and using the Speedtest app, I consistently max out the meter on my wifi connection, with downloads in excess of 22 Mbps and uploads between 5-7 Mbps.  Using 4g, the average dl speed is typically between 10-15 Mbps...granted, since I don't have unlimited data, I don't necessarily WANT that speed to be high, although it is quite flattering....those who have unlimited plans can probably appreciate these speeds a little more :D

Downloading large files, such as apps and podcasts, is lightning-quick.  Streaming video through apps is also a snap.  The A6(?) processor also makes navigating the phone a breeze...I never wait for apps to load, and tapping through the settings and messaging menus feels completely natural with no lag.  The coupled performance of the 4G/LTE data and A6 processors really make this phone feel as though it has no limits; Apple has truly created a legendary device here with incredible speeds.  From some of the sources I have read, the 5 consistenly outmatches the SIII in various graphics and performance benchmarks, and I certainly estimate those tests to be true, based on my experience.

Now, for the notification bar.  This also seems to be a topic of annoyance for many people, yet I have had nothing but good experiences with it.  Very similar to the Android notification bar (which DID come first, I must acknowledge), yet works very snappy and holds LOTS of information on it for such a ""small"" screen (compared to Android phones).  The stock apps that show the weather and a stock ticker look very professional and streamlined, and the brushed-metal textures only enhance the looks that iOS frequently displays.

As a side-note: Siri is fantastic.  Granted, it is still in beta, and there are many things that I wish it could do (such as search for AND download apps, have more realistic conversations with you, etc....(because this is what I love doing with Siri the most, it gives a good laugh)) it pulls up information very quickly, is very responsive, and generally just a blast to use.  I often find myself using it in situations where it is non-essential, yet just is a fun and quirky app to play with.

Now, there are only a few gripes that I have experienced while tinkering with iOS 6:

Sometimes the 'soft' buttons on screen are too small to be tactfully and accurately touched, notably the 'close' buttons on the notification bar.  I do not think that this is a problem with the 5's hardware or screen capacity, yet is mostly just a con of iOS's old design-style.

The entire 'phone' app, with the dialer and contacts display, just seems old fashioned and needs a redesign, dialer in particular.

Maps.  Though I cant complain too much about this, and the maps themselves function just fine, maps are clearly Google's game and Apple should have just kept them in iOS 6.  Although, the 3d feature is very cool and novel.


That's really all I can think of right now, can't believe I almost hit the 10,000 character limit.  I'll post an edit later if I think of anything else.

All in all, I hope this 'review' serves some purpose for those who are facing the same decision that I had to make.  I love the iPhone 5 and have no intention of trading it in for an Android phone.  With both the unparalleled physical design and the ridiculously fast data &amp; software paired, this phone is truly a work of art and a technological masterpiece, and is probably the best smartphone that has ever been developed at this point.",57,73,2012-11-25,AAPL,0.032950516790151596,0.9238624274730682,0.043187061324715614
