apple,Jesus 9to5mac's new design is a busy mess. It's an unmitigated disaster.,"TL;DR I'm done reading 9to5Mac

I've long detested their comment engine choice and template used. But the new design change put me over the edge so I'm taking a long overdue possibly permanent break from the site. Reminds me a little of TUAW's design change way back when. I remember a flood of people left and never went back. Happened to Digg too on v3.0—before the great upheaval (Cocoon reference).

Usually it's major design changes to sites which finally push me over the edge. How about you? What sites have you stopped visiting never to return as a regular and why? No doubt if this post gets anywhere the powers that be over there will comment here to say they are listening but they don't listen. I've seen several commentors over there over the past couple of years complain about the Wordpress comments system but it has consistently fell on deaf ears. If they were good at web design I wouldn't give a shit if they didn't listen—they are not. Wordpress is the jankiest, buggiest comment platform there is. There's no debate or discussion to be had about it. Disqus literally crushes it to bits: it's way faster, it's virtually bug-free and it's everywhere!

If they were really lazy and just copied the design of MacRumors bit for bit it'd be like a glass of ice-water in hell.

The new design deserves no chance, it's terrible. When Apple changes the design of Apple.com they invariably always simplify and clarify and it's better upon first blush. Similar to how MacRumours recent design changes were so obviously better immediately. I actually think WordPress in general offer some of the ugliest templates. The site would by a ton better if they simply switched to bog standard Tumblr and threw in Disqus comments and called it a day.

And what's up with all those ads!? When everything's an ad, nothing's an ad.

apple,"Apple Music has its UI flaws, but it's music discovery is unmatched and should be something other competing streaming platforms adopt.","Apple music has already opened my eyes to two or three entire genres of music that I hadn't listened to before. 

For example, I've always enjoyed a lot of experimental electronic sounds, like Arca, Crystal Castles, and the like, along with experimental, subdued hip hop and have also always gravitated towards ""future"" electronic pop like AlunaGeorge and SOPHIE. 

these tastes, at least as far as spotify goes, are a bit too diverse to give good recommendations. I always end up getting recommend top charting rap, OR some older R&amp;B OR electronic music like Jon Hopkins. 

Spotify recommends new music based on similarities, I've noticed Apple music recommends new music based on TASTE, And that's the main thing that's getting me to stick with it (despite the fact that I CANT VIEW AN ALBUM FROM A PLAYING SONG)

Apple music gave me a few playlists, and one was just amazing. ""The new wave of indie R&amp;B"" Blended and expanded upon the sounds I already listened to. Rap features, layered electronic production and R&amp;B twinge was this interesting and new synthesis of what I enjoy, not just more similar things. Building off of this music, a few days later Apple music also served up a new playlist, downtempo R&amp;B, which appealed to a lot of dream pop tendencies I've had and merged them with the new indie R&amp;B Id been hearing. So much of this music was new, but just enough was familiar- Apple music, in my experience, perfectly strikes the sweet spot between current taste and developing taste with its recommendations. It really does know what I want before I know. I could go on about the dozens of playlists I was introduced to by following this thread of new great music that fit my tastes, but I've added probably about 30 new albums to my library since apple music has started that I now listen to regularly and are excited about exploring further. 

Apple screwed up on some UI issues, but at its core Apple music has offered a phenomenal way to listen to and discover new music. 

Until spotify adopts that, there's no question that I'll be sticking with Apple music.",132,262,2015-08-02,AAPL,0.029506102204322815,0.9336361885070801,0.03685775399208069

apple,Introducing the What Should I Buy Wiki!,"**Hello /r/Apple!**

In an effort to help people find advice faster and also reduce the amount of Product advice threads, we've created the new **[What Should I Buy Wiki!](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/wiki/whatshouldibuy)** 

This new *publicly editable* Wiki is a place where we envision that each product can have its features and benefits broken down in a logical manner, with recommendations made for different uses to help people find what they are looking for! This should hopefully help people get more comprehensive and timely advice on what product would work for them, rather than waiting for the Megathread or creating a thread that duplicates others asked in the past. 

***Being a Wiki though this will be a community effort***, and while we've tried to get the ball rolling with the Macbook section, we need helpers to continue to finish off the other product categories and fill out the advice as this is more than a 1 person job! 


Furthermore, we have also created a new [Index of /r/Apple's Wiki pages](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/wiki/index) which we hope will help in finding /r/Apple's other hidden Wiki pages and to collate them into an easier to reach place. Go have a look!

Lastly as a disclaimer, please be aware that whilst this is a publicly editable Wiki (for now on a trial basis), that there are backups of this Wiki, so if you maliciously edit this Wiki it will be reverted and you will be Banned from editing again.

We hope you find this a super useful resource and are having a great weekend, and as always keep up the amazing posts!

Only after desperation of thinking I had to restore my mac to a previous backup (Recent Windows user convert here) did I realize they backup everything in a file system rather then save an image of the disk like Windows does. And not only that, I noticed it did a backup exactly as I finished writing. Maybe it was a coincidence but I want to believe Time Machine did that for me. 

If the developer of Time Machine sees this, THANK YOU. You saved me hours upon hours of agony. I'm very happy with my new Macbook Pro (2 months old). And I truly believe it's worth every penny.

apple,Apple has crippled customized iTunes Radio stations in iOS 8.4 and iTunes 12.2,"One of my favorite features from Apple up until recently was iTunes Radio. I paid for the yearly subscription so that I could get it ad-free, and found it to be significantly better than competing services like Pandora.

I loved that you could switch a radio station between ""Hits"", ""Variety"", and ""Discovery"", because I'm not that into big hits and I love discovering new music.

I loved that you could add additional artists to the station to make it more complex and interesting. Over the years I've managed to make some radio stations that play a great variety of songs that I consistently enjoy, something no other streaming or radio service has ever accomplished.

I loved that you could edit your list of songs for which you selected ""play more like this"" and ""never play again"", especially because sometimes you would add a song to either of those lists by mistake, or doing so would cause your radio station to change in ways that you didn't intend. It was always possible to go into the station and tweak it to your liking.

Basically, it was a great system for being able to set up customized music stations, perhaps the best around.

Unfortunately, *every single one of the features I just listed* were unceremoniously removed in iOS 8.4 and iTunes 12.2 without any warning.

There's a lot I love about using Apple's hardware and software, and at the end of the day I think it's preferable to the alternatives, but god dammit, I'm so tired of Apple gutting and crippling features that I love and rely on for unknown and unnecessary reasons.

There was no need to remove these features from iTunes Radio. It doesn't improve the user experience. Not being able to revert mistakes is a **serious** usability flaw. It doesn't make it any simpler, either. These features could easily have been tucked away under a context menu so that users who don't need them or don't care can just ignore them. The only thing I can think of is that it makes all of the radio stations behave *consistently*, both the custom ones and the new curated ones. That hardly strikes me as a big enough benefit to justify something like this. These features could have easily been enabled just for the custom radio stations without degrading usability one bit.

My experience using Apple products is littered with incidents like this, and I'm sure it won't stop. I can appreciate the necessity of removing old, stale features from products and software -- I mean, just look at the mess Microsoft got themselves into with Windows in trying to support legacy stuff. But I've always felt Apple is over-zealous with their feature-chopping axe in situations where it's not warranted, needed or desired.

Okay, I'm done ranting. Does anyone else feel this way? Did any of you have much-loved features in Apple products that they crippled or removed?",29,156,2015-08-10,AAPL,0.06125868111848831,0.9059118628501892,0.032829467207193375

##FAQ

####Why reinstall OS X?

There are three instances in the chart in which this may come up:

* When the filesystem appears to be corrupt, but a disk repair does not solve it.
* After a hard drive replacement.
* When the kernel is misbehaving, and not as a result of bad SMC settings or kernel extensions.

####What does `kextfind -loaded -not -b -s com.apple` do?

This returns a list of non-Apple kernel extensions you have running. It is useful in eliminating variables with a misbehaving kernel.

####What does `sudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force` do?

This rebuilds your shared software library cache. A malformed shared library cache can cause apps to struggle (or even fail) to open. Rebuilding the cache can also be achieved by [booting into Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/HT201262) once.

####You're missing stuff!

Of course I am! The intent of this chart is to cover the *most common* issues; this does not include steps such as removing startup items, as these only contribute to performance issues in unique situations. Various paths in the chart lead to ""consult the community"" for software issues, or ""consult a service provider"" with hardware issues.",18,126,2015-08-10,AAPL,0.11987333744764328,0.8535075187683105,0.026619210839271545

apple,"Purify (content blocker for iOS 9): Updates, and Beta Signup!","Hi!

About a month ago, [I shared a sneak-peek of Purify](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3b1xz3/sneakpeek_at_purify_adblocking_and_more_on_ios/), the upcoming content blocker for iOS 9 that makes the mobile web beautiful again by eliminating unwanted bloat.

I have a couple of things to share with you today:

* We've been doing benchmarks and tests using the top mobile websites and Purify, and we've seen **over 50% bandwidth savings and 2x faster page load times!** We think that's going to be really neat especially given that most people have metered data plans.

* **[Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzJfyB6LrJs)** in case you haven't seen it. Also, be on the lookout for a new demo video over the next few days. :)
 
* It's so awesome you guys want to help out beta-test Purify! **[Here's a link where you can sign-up to become a beta tester](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hEHh7Zh2R7qxWUjVsJUHuA6zYMaCy_9N5q1xfgfo5Ok/viewform?usp=send_form)**.

Please note there is a limit to how many beta-testers can be added to TestFlight, so please don't get mad if I'm unable to add everyone right away.

I'm so excited to be working on Purify — I hope you guys and every iOS user out there will love it.

If you have any thoughts or ideas about Purify please feel free to share them — they're much appreciated!

**Edit:** link to weird video has been replaced. [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRUVMfBnTkU) just in case you're curious.

**Edit 2:** Thank you so much for signing up! TestFlight still doesn't currently support public beta testing on beta versions of iOS (though Apple just recently added that capability for internal testing). This means that people who signed up will start receiving the beta invitations as soon as Apple adds that capability — it's unknown when exactly that's going to happen, but it should be soon hopefully.

**Edit 3:** Apple just flipped the switch on external testing. Purify beta submitted for review! Should start seeding soon.

**Edit 4:** Apple flipped the switch back. Sigh; I apologize. We'll see what happens over the next few hours/days.

Thanks,

He also stated Geekbench reported that the 6s Plus had a 1.85Ghz CPU and 1.96GB of RAM.

apple,Do this on your parents Mac if you dan't want them to make you deal with MacKeeper bullshit.,"I had to deal with this shit yesterday and it wasn't fun, my mom somehow managed to install MacKeeper on her Mac and it fucked up the whole machine.

So I created a script that will block all mackeeper domains (that I know of in any case) so every time some shady site your parents visit redirects them to mackeeper it won't even load and the crisis will be averted in first place.

GitHub (source): https://github.com/avatsaev/mackeeper_blocker

Just execute the script in the terminal app, if you have no idea what to do or how to use terminal, ask here.

PS: There is a way mackeeper PR guys are monitoring this sub, so don't let them bury this thread.

apple,It may be time to have that talk again with your loved ones...,"So yesterday my father received a popup on Safari that held his browser hostage until he called a 1-888 number. When all was said and done he paid them $250.00 and he had LogMeIn and couple of cash cleaner apps installed. The company that ""took care of him"" was ""VEHelp.com."" So I've now set aside some time to do a wipe and reinstall of everything (as they had VNC access to his machine and I have no idea what back doors they may have opened).   
   
   

I've had the talk with my father several times over the past 15 years about suspicious website activity. And I've told him repeatedly that I'm the one to call when stuff doesn't work. He was quite adamant about how professional these people sounded and I told him it was as if someone came to your house, set it on fire and then told you their ready and waiting fire truck could put it out for a fee. I think he gets it now. He's put a hold on his credit card and we are currently in the process of getting a refund from these charlatans.

So can you imagine if after all this time apple comes along and says no more of VHS era tech just get out your phone and put your thumb on touch ID and you're away.

Options will come up to disable buttons, or even the touch screen, and set a timer. Click start and the home button will be disabled, restricting it to the same app .

apple,"Beta signup for Apollo, a brand new Reddit app for iPhone","Hey all,

I'm the developer of [Apollo](http://apolloapp.io), a brand new Reddit client for iPhone. [I posted here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/) with a sneak peek of Apollo, and it was really well received, so I wanted to keep everyone posted. I'm doing a second round of signups for the Apollo beta and I thought some of you might be interested in getting your hands on it. I'd certainly love to hear what you think and if you have any suggestions to make it the best Reddit app out there.

**Here's the signup link to get into the Apollo beta:** *No more spots left, sorry. :( Would love to have you but Apple only allows the 2,000. If you want, you can sign up at http://apolloapp.io to get a notification when it's available on the App Store (not far off) or sub to /r/apolloapp.*

If you're hearing about Apollo for the first time, I'm a long time Redditor and a former Apple intern, and I've just never been completely pleased by the Reddit apps available for iOS, so awhile back I decided to build my own, and do it different. I put a big focus on making a really powerful client that looked and felt great (really wanted to make sure it felt at home on iOS, with native controls and looking like something Apple might have built), and was super comfortable and fast to use. I really want it to be no-compromise, with all the features of the main website incorporated delightfully into an iOS experience, to the point that you'll prefer to use Apollo over the Reddit.com website. I remember using Tweetie for iPhone way back when (anyone remember that?) and for the first time finding an app that I enjoyed *more* than the actual website. That's what I want in Apollo.

I've been desinging and building it for quite awhile now, and when I interned as an iOS developer at Apple last summer I got a bunch of great feedback from some brilliant people there. I'm really proud of how it's coming along.

[Here's an album of some screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/Gswi8)

Apple announced at WWDC that they're inceasing the maximum amount of users a developer can have in TestFlight from 1,000 to 2,000 (yay!) so that's what's permitting this. The increase hasn't occurred yet, but you'll be added as soon as Apple puts the change live. I've also removed some inactive users from the beta and I have around 200 slots available right now that'll be put through on Wednesday! Will also be putting a new beta out Wednesday with a bunch of bug fixes and some new features.

As far as progress on the app goes (hard to believe the last post I made here was 5 months ago!), it's going really well, and I've been lucky enough to finish up school so I've been able to work more or less full-time on it over the last month or so. There's still a decent amount to go, but I'm feeling really great about it and how it's progressing, so it won't be too long before it's available on the App Store. If you want a notification for that, you can sign up at http://apolloapp.io and I'll notify you when it's in the App Store.

There's also a subreddit set up if you'd like to keep up to date: /r/apolloapp

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to post as well. Would love to hear what you guys think. :) (And of course, if you get into the beta, feel free to send an email with your feedback through TestFlight as well!)",123,83,2015-08-17,AAPL,0.030681295320391655,0.9187905192375183,0.05052820220589638

apple,Super Tip: How to turn your iPod or iPad into a phone using Google Voice,"Today I'm going to show you how you can make calls and send SMS messages for free in the US using Google Voice and Hangouts on your iPod or iPad.

1. Start by going to [google.com/voice](http://google.com/voice) (use a computer please, not your iDevice) and sign in with your Google account.
2. Now we need to set up the account. If you aren't prompted already, click the ""Get a Voice number"" link in the left sidebar. You likely want to use ""I want a new number"".
3. You need a working phone number for this step. Enter it and click Continue. Then click Call Me Now and enter the verification code.
4. Once you're done with the wizard, we need to disable ringing the other phone you just added. (If you want this, skip this step.) Head over to the gear menu &gt; Settings. From the Phones tab, uncheck your mobile number. Then go to the Groups &amp; Circles tab and click Edit on All Contacts, uncheck your mobile number, and Save. Repeat for all other circles.
5. Now we need to get the iOS backend setup. Download Hangouts from the AppStore. (Don't download the Google Voice app. It looks terrible, and doesn't even work.)
6. Sign in with your Google account. Your Voice number should automatically be added.
7. Now let's enable SMS and calling in Hangouts. Head to the menu (top left) and then Settings, tap Phone Number. Your Google Voice number should be there. Flip on Messages and Incoming Phone Calls.
8. If you allowed access to your contacts, you probably don't want Sync Contacts on (as it causes your circles to see your contacts). Flip it off in the main level of Settings.
9. Close Settings and go back to the main app. Time to make sure it works. Go to the Chat tab, and tap +. Choose a number or type one in. Send it a text message. You should receive it on your other phone in a few seconds.
10. Text your Voice number back. Again, it should arrive within seconds.
11. Now go to the Phone tab and tap the Keypad icon. Dial a number, or tap the Contacts icon to choose a contact.
12. Your device will call them. You've turned your iPod/iPad into a *phone!* Have someone pick up on the other end.
13. Call back your Voice number from another phone. If the device is locked, it will show a notification on the LS that you have to slide to answer the call. If you're not in the app, tap the banner to answer the call. Once you're done, press the hang up button.
14. If your other phone rang during step 13, you might have done Step 4 wrong. Double-check your settings and try again.

That's all there is to it! No gimmicks whatsoever. Just remember you probably cannot contact emergency services (not going to try), and you still have to be on wifi to get/make SMSes or calls (except if you have a cellular iPad, where this comes in *really* handy). Since the iPod and iPad don't have speakers, you can use a headset with a mic to make it so only you hear your calls.",24,52,2015-08-20,AAPL,0.07628136873245239,0.8990191221237183,0.024699507281184196

apple,I've noticed some significant visual changes to Apple Maps over the last few days,"When all the new Maps features rolled out with the iOS 9 betas, I was surprised to see that not much had changed visually. The app has essentially looked the same since iOS 7, when Apple changed the colour scheme of the roads and map tiles the year after the app was first introduced with iOS 6. But since then, not much has changed on the visual side of things.

Anyways, fast forward to the last few days, and I've noticed a number of aesthetic changes that must have just been pushed out server-side.

* First and foremost, the typeface for all POIs has been updated. It looks like Apple finally made the switch over to SF for map labels.

* The colour scheme for POIs has change significantly. [Here is an index](https://i.imgur.com/IWUxvJY.jpg) that [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2e0ylc/apple_maps_icon_analysis/cjvhm3j) Redditors created last year of all the POI types and their associated icons. Look at the app now and you'll see tons of colour changes from that. The likely reasoning is that Apple colour-codes the icons based on the category of the POI, and it was running into inconsistencies, so it decided to scrap many of the current choices and start fresh.

* Some tiles have also changed colours. For example the tan-coloured tiles on which just about all stores and malls sit, are now a lighter colour. They used to be a more brownish shade, but now they're more yellowish. Similarly, the red tiles on which hospitals sit have also been changed to a lighter shade of red. I like these updates. They're more aesthetically pleasing to my eye.

* Gas stations now use a slightly smaller icon. Not only that, but all POI icons shrink slightly when you zoom out, to allow for more space on the map. And speaking of zoom, the maximum zoom has increased from 24m on the scale to 15m (ie. 2.56 times as large), although this has been the case since the iOS 9 betas first started rolling out a couple months ago.

* POIs, roads, and map tiles all load way faster. In other words, when you zoom in or out, the map refreshes much more quickly than it did even a week ago. This is a very welcome improvement.

Have you noticed any other updates or recent changes to the Maps app?

**Edit:** I might be wrong about the switch to SF. I'm not great at identifying fonts, and the labels do look different, so I assumed they switched to SF. But now that I'm taking a closer look, it might simply be a matter of removing the bold. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/tKFf6Z7.jpg)'s a screenshot. Take a look at the text for the individual  places (ie. McDonald's and Natural Solutions), and compare that to the shopping centre's label (Toronto Eaton Centre). The latter is how everything used to look. But now, individual POIs have a thinner looking font. Perhaps someone who knows more about typefaces than I can clear this up. Is this still Avenir and is the only difference the facts that some labels are bold while others are not?",28,58,2015-08-29,AAPL,0.08435637503862381,0.8856577277183533,0.029985973611474037
apple,What is the best ergonomic keyboard and why?,"Sorry if this is not the best subreddit to post this, but I have a Mac, and I want to find a good ergonomic keyboard. I've googled it and read reviews, but I'd like to get some feedback from my fellow redditors.  I want to spend my money wisely, and don't want to buy something subpar. I want to get it right the first time, if possible.

I have been experiencing pinched nerve feelings in my wrist and hands, and most recently, pain in my right hand.

I do the things you're not supposed to do (recently found this out after I googled it). Lots of wrist action, reaching over, my wrists are higher than my hands, the keyboard is away from me. I don't have proper form on my typing. I do a lot of hunting and pecking. I use my mouse a lot. I'm going to see what new keyboard shortcuts I can pick up.

In the meantime, I'll scoot my keyboard to the edge of my desk, try not to use my wrists so much, and try to keep them at least level with my hands. Any other tips are also appreciated.",39,39,2015-08-29,AAPL,0.0369882807135582,0.9236560463905334,0.039355698972940445

apple,The 16-64-128GB storage scheme is how Apple has been able to maintain (and increase) their margin. Don't expect this to go away.,"* Switching to a 16-64-128 scheme was *genius* on their part. It drove A LOT of people to the 64GB upgrade that would have otherwise picked the 32GB if it were the base model (me). 

* This allowed them to increase iPhone average selling price (ASP) and margin while essentially doing nothing. Investors *ate it up*. 

* The competition is not typically offering more internal storage as a base than Apple so the Hand of the market isn't exactly imploring them to increase base storage. (yes I know some phones have 32GB base)

* I would like the base storage to be increased as much as the next guy, but the fact of the matter is it isn't going to happen. It's too lucrative for Apple, and they aren't driven to do so.


EDIT: I think it's important for me to reiterate that *as a consumer* I wish they would change the base to 32GB.

That part went smoothly.

I used an external HD for time machine and had it encrypted. Yep, it didn't occur to me that upon reformatting my computer I'd lose access to the impossibly complex password I had stored in Keychain. So there is 100% no way for me to get to my backup or the 5 years of pictures, files, programs, etc. And in the state of paranoia that brought on the decision to encrypt my time machine back up, I didn't share my keychain on iCloud.
