apple,A Note About Leaks on /r/Apple From /u/Foxconninsider,"There has been a lot of internal discussion within the mod team about the best way to handle the recent leaks. In an effort to be totally transparent, there has been some disagreement on whether or not we should, as a mod team, be responsible for verifying leaks because this opens up a lot of paths we don't necessarily want to go down.

As a mod team (and fans with as much keen interest in this information as anyone else here), we believed that in verifying this user we would be shifting our responsibilities from discussing leaks to actively facilitating them. This could also be taken as encouragement for future leaks and parties trying to sell off such information. We also felt there was an agenda with these leaks being posted and the parties involved, and we do not believe it's in good taste for us to be proactively taking part.

***As such, we have decided to not verify /u/Foxconninsider.***

Due to the sensational nature of some of the claims we have decided to let these leaks continue to be posted by /u/Foxconninsider and eventually speak for themselves, but we will no longer be verifying their legitimacy on any official level. We originally asked for a second round of verification after requests in the last post, and while /u/Foxconninsider was actively working on a secure way to provide it to us, we have stopped progress and will no longer be receiving this information. For the record, we did receive verification the first time around from someone with access to this information. We will not expand on what that information was.

Please take /u/Foxconninsider's information as you will as we get closer to the iPhone announcement this September.

Thanks,

I just noticed how big and bold the new font looks on iOS 11 compared to iOS 10. 

It really bothers me how ""cramped"" everything is looking now on the SE, I mean, I've already tried to change the size in the settings but it only changes the size of the font used in menus and text messages but not in areas such as the homescreen or the numpad. It just looks way too cramped and as dumb it might sound, that might be the main reason why I wont be upgrading unless Apple does something against it. I mean, everything looked pretty much fine on iOS 10 but now, everything feels even more unoptimized for the SE.

apple,The elephant in the iOS 11 room - (practically) no local storage in Files,"Everyone seems very excited about the Files app in iOS 11, and obviously it's a good move - iOS has long needed a better way to manage and access files. Here's the problem, though. It's only for cloud storage providers.

If you go out and buy a 512GB iPad Pro, and you want to stick hundreds of GB of files on it (because, you know, that's why you bought one with so much storage), you can't just do that. You have to pay extra for a cloud storage provider like iCloud Drive to store those files in. Only *then* can you have them downloaded in the Files app. Want to save a file from Safari? Only to cloud storage.

There *is* an ""On my iPad"" section of the Files app, but it is near useless. It basically just acts as a UI for files that take part in the old ""iTunes File Sharing"" system from circa iOS *3*. It is practically read-only, unless you use an app that supports iTunes File Sharing. You can't save files there. You can't even make a new folder there. All I have there is some old GarageBand songs from years ago I exported out.

It's baffling to me that Apple can't just make a local folder on your iPad you could use for the Files app, to take advantage of these giant 128/256/512GB iPads they now sell. If you want to use these iPads for file storage, you not only have to buy a large iPad, you *also* have to pay extra monthly for cloud storage somewhere, which seems like a completely pointless and arbitrary limitation.",229,628,2017-08-06,AAPL,0.02366797812283039,0.9359952211380005,0.04033687338232994

* Screen is different as it has more screen space, and there is a sensor ""cutout"". 

* With this screen, it will be interesting to see what Apple will do with the Status Bar. 

* The iPhone 8 Marquees has at hand is a 5.7 to 5.8"" screen

* Glass back which could mean Wireless Charging in the future. 

* Camera bump is still there, and it seems bigger this year. Interesting to see what upgrades we get this year

* The power button is bigger. Leaks say this is just a normal button (no Touch ID) and Apple will go with Facial Recognition.",360,354,2017-08-07,AAPL,0.03945259749889374,0.9056435227394104,0.05490395799279213

iphone,PSA: The iPhone 7s/8 is due for announcement in September. Don't buy an iPhone 7 now.,"This is a question that pops up a lot, and the answer is the same every year.

1. Should I buy an iPhone now or wait for the new one?

The answer is, its up to you, but most likely, the iPhone 7's will receive a $100 discount, because of the new releases.

edit: Theres alot of comments saying that you can still buy a 7, and its still good phone etc etc. I know that, and that definitely is not the point of the post. 

1. The iPhone 8 might be epic so you might wanna wait for it.
2. The iPhone 7 will drop in price when the next model releases (if you don't want the newer model).

I'm not saying you shouldn't buy a iPhone 7, nor that it's a bad phone. I'm just saying you should probably wait for a month/two months to see if the announcement influences anything.",102,307,2017-08-07,AAPL,0.033477578312158585,0.9202013611793518,0.046321116387844086

apple,100WPM typist here: The new Macbook Pro's keyboard is fantastic.,"I'm aware of the schism in this subreddit regarding the new MacBook keyboards. Some think it's fantastic, some hate it. The thing lacking in these arguments for me, is the experience level of the person giving the opinion. I'm much more likely to side with the people that type over a certain WPM.

Anyway, I decided to go test out the new keyboards yesterday. So here are my credentials before we jump into this:

* I'm a developer
* I type around 100WPM
* I've been into ergonomics for many years (Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 anyone? Logitech Mx Revolution... Kinesis Advantage Pro (my current keyboard)... standing desks... etc.

So I go in and test the 13"" Macbook Pro. I hop on TypeRacer (great little site and game for keeping your typing sharp) and start going to town. Now normally, especially with people around and with such a small keyboard, I'm only guaranteed like.... 87WPM. I was able to ""consistently"" hit 102WPM without even trying and I could have probably hit 110WPM. It's hard to explain but the tactile-ness of the keys are perfect. If you are a fast touch typist you know the importance of striking the keys with the least amount of effort possible for speed. The travel and tactileness on this keyboard almost forces you to type this way. The travel is minimal, but the tactile feeling is still substantial somehow. Also... I'm currently on a 2011 Macbook Pro 15"".. the keys on the 13"" are HUGE. Bigger than any keyboard I've ever owned, and this definitely increased my accuracy by quite a bit. The ergonomics of it feel great... I feel I could type a great deal on this laptop and still feel comfortable (but we'll see how I feel long term after buying it).

tl;dr Everyone is entitled to their opinion but mine is the the keyboard is fantastic, feels great and accurate and I can't wait to code on this thing.",268,577,2017-08-09,AAPL,0.034971095621585846,0.9270281195640564,0.03800078108906746

apple,This developer found an sure way of making money and climbing AppStore charts. So Lame.,"One again I’ve found an rather clever developer. I get alerts every morning on apps, movies and Mac apps that go on sale so I was scrolling through the list and came across [this](https://appsto.re/us/S4BKkb.i https://appsto.re/us/S4BKkb.i) app Police Tracker with Radar by Black Software LLC, which went free and had good review stars so I downloaded it and it is such an scheming ass app if you ask me. Sad part is that it may “not” be against apples rules. I’m not sure. 

Upon downloading the app, it takes you through an 8 step questionnaire. After **EACH** response, it’ll pop over with an full screen advertisement and then takes you to an screen that seems to mimic the Waze Navigation app and pretty much does nothing. 

The worst part about this app is that upon force closing it or after an period of time of not using it, when you open the app again you must go through the questions AGAIN, and again full screen ads after each response, making them more money on ads. And if you look at the reviews, it states you have to give it an 5 star app rating to unlock its full potential. I haven’t seen such an requirement yet but this app is sure to run up the charts with such an requirement and it’s pure shit. 

The questions are so damn pointless but they had to make up something to have enough questions to benefit the number of advertisements they wanted to appear. Hell, #4 asks about sending alerts but yet the app doesn’t ask to have push notifications sent to your device.

apple,Tim Cook's letter to employees re: Charlottesville,"Team,

Like so many of you, equality is at the core of my beliefs and values. The events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me, and I’ve heard from many people at Apple who are saddened, outraged or confused. 

What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. Its scars last generations. History has taught us this time and time again, both in the United States and countries around the world. 

We must not witness or permit such hate and bigotry in our country, and we must be unequivocal about it. This is not about the left or the right, conservative or liberal. It is about human decency and morality. I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans. 

Regardless of your political views, we must all stand together on this one point — that we are all equal. As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect. 

I believe Apple has led by example, and we’re going to keep doing that. We have always welcomed people from every walk of life to our stores around the world and showed them that Apple is inclusive of everyone. We empower people to share their views and express themselves through our products. 

In the wake of the tragic and repulsive events in Charlottesville, we are stepping up to help organizations who work to rid our country of hate. Apple will be making contributions of $1 million each to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. We will also match two-for-one our employees’ donations to these and several other human rights groups, between now and September 30. 

In the coming days, iTunes will offer users an easy way to join us in directly supporting the work of the SPLC. 

Dr. Martin Luther King said, “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter.” So, we will continue to speak up. These have been dark days, but I remain as optimistic as ever that the future is bright. Apple can and will play an important role in bringing about positive change. 

Best,
Tim

For a lot of people this is the main reason they would pick apple over anyone else",135,229,2017-08-19,AAPL,0.06738413125276566,0.9051697254180908,0.02744615636765957
AppleWatch,I was wrong about the Apple Watch,"Like most long-term Apple users I was super excited about the rumors of an Apple Watch.  I followed its development for at least a year and when Apple announced it with great fanfare ... I just couldn't pull the trigger.  A couple friends bought and returned them after a few weeks of use. I was feeling a stong sense of disappointment -- this was Apple's first major new product category launch since Steve Jobs died, and I had a growing suspicion that all the Tim Cook bashers might be right. Maybe when Steve Jobs died so did Apple's magic and innovation?

So a year went by and I waited on the sidelines.  On a few occasions I bashed Apple Watch to friends who asked me for an opinion.  And I was totally convinced that the square shape was a bad design choice -- boring, uninspired and NOT something Steve Jobs would have done.  After all, why did almost every other Apple product inspire instant lust in me, a gotta-have-it no matter what the price feeling?

Fast forward to the release of the Nike Edition Apple Watch.  With its bright, bold silicone elastomer band, built-in GPS, faster processor, improved waterproofing and longer battery life I found myself slowly warming up to the idea of actually owning one. And the other wearables -- Fitbit, Pebble, Garmin -- were all stagnating and proving to be cheaply built, limited function gadgets.  What I started to see and appreciate in the Apple Watch as in almost everything Apple is they ""grow"" their products within a comprehensive ecosystem. I began to appreciate that actually wearing an extension of the Apple ecosystem on my wrist would deliver a myriad of benefits.

Truly “getting”the Apple Watch happens when interacting with it over a period of time and in different circumstances. Only by experiencing Apple Watch day-to-day, up close and on my wrist could I wrap my head around why anybody would want one more device to keep charged.  One stand-out example of the Apple Watch is how it has changed how I text, using it almost exclusively now for this form of communications.  When someone texts me, ""Hey whats up?"" I used to peck out ""Not much"" on my iPhone and conduct the typically limited and frustrating text exchange.  Now when someone texts me, I hit the microphone button on my Apple Watch and dictate exactly whats on my mind: ""Oh its been a long week, but maybe going to catch a movie later ... anything you want to see?  If you're not up for that maybe breakfast on Sunday?"" and this makes all the difference. Texting for me is now a conversation, not throwing emoticons and short abbreviations back and forth (""brb, ttyl, LOL"").  As much as I love the efficiency of modern texting, I really do savor how my Apple Watch has brought conversation and dialogue back into my textual interactions.

Another sublime example of how the Apple Watch has changed things is the other night when I was falling asleep. My iPhone was charging across the room and my watch vibrated on my wrist.  I took the call and had a long conversation as I lie in bed, warm and comfortable in my sheets, feeling connected in conversation while the technology just simply disappeared.  And yesterday as I often do, I left my iPhone in my car, parked on the street. Inside my house my Apple Watch did its thing, connecting to my WiFi network and the world and my phone calls found me and I grabbed an important call with a doctor.

So Apple, I've been one your biggest fans and for a while was one of your biggest doubters. I was so eager for a mind-blowing new product category from you I didn't have the patience to let my mind be blown. And as we're approaching the felease of the next generation with rumored LTE capability, I'm happy not just for the success of the Apple Watch and for what it brings to my life in hundreds of ways large and small.  I'm happy that the DNA of Apple still seems strong, the principles that made them great live on.  Apple is still willing to make the RIGHT choices and the confidence and faith that its users will understand this.  It took me a long time to warm up to the Apple Watch, and its become one of my favorite gadgets.  And as a lifelong gadget freak and collector you have to trust me when I say this means an awful lot. 

TLDR; I was too impatient for my mind to be blown when the Apple Watch was released.  So I sat back, relaxed and let Apple patiently blow my mind. We are both very happy now.",91,189,2017-08-19,AAPL,0.04391882196068764,0.9230636954307556,0.03301753103733063

apple,The iPhone's Music app is horribly gimped for library use.,"It really frustrates me that in its effort to push the subscription service, Apple has so severely hobbled the native app that my existing music library, which I spent thousands of dollars on, is practically useless. 

Chief among the missing features that used to be there are Genius and listing all tracks by an artist, while many intuitive and obvious features somehow never got added to the app but I believe made it into the streaming service: creating smart playlists, searching by attributes, and easily rating songs. There are other weird flaws like duplicating every track on purchased albums that have been synced from iTunes (I'm sure there's a way to fix this but I can't find it, and it essentially rules out purchased albums for car listening). 

The iPod app was *the* killer app on my iPhone in 2008. Genius was the coolest thing ever, making it effortless to create a quick playlist - fantastic for driving. I understand why they killed Genius, to push the equivalent feature in Apple Music - but this really hurts those of us who've invested in a library. My iTunes music library is less usable than it was before Apple Music came out. 

So what's the solution? For me, it's a pretty sad one: I use Spotify for everyday listening, ignoring the library I've purchased over decades, and only muscle my way through the barely navigable app when I absolutely need to, like when driving abroad or in the mountains, but even for that I've got my saved playlists on Spotify. 

I've tried third party front apps, like Cesium, but none of them quite solve the problems. The duplicate tracks seem to be created at the OS level and nobody seems to have created a workaround. It's still impossible to create a smart playlist or search by attributes (wouldn't it be great if I could play all my top tracks from 2006?). 

Really, I'm going to have to just put the time and effort into creating a few custom playlists on iTunes on my Mac and syncing them over like I did in 2008, because despite having a 5"" screen and a dual core processor my phone is still too hobbled to run a sophisticated search within music or help me at least quickly add a track to my 3 star smart playlist.",164,419,2017-08-22,AAPL,0.038045283406972885,0.9305530190467834,0.03140171617269516

iphone,Finally in on the SE-cret,"Well, it finally happened. The second-hand iPhone 6 I got off of Swappa decided to start living life as a slinky. Unfortunately, iPhones don't go down stairs quite as gracefully as a Slinky, especially when the stairs are made of tile. 

I picked up a 32GB iPhone SE from Walmart for about $140 (after tax!) for Straight Talk / Total Wireless. (A great deal, but not the only reason I'm posting.) This thing is like a breath of fresh air coming from the 6. Switching apps, search results, and any other OS interaction is buttery smooth and fast as hell. I couldn't help but feel like I was going to miss the extra screen real estate, but honestly? I don't. I can reach every part of the screen one-handed, and it's easier for me to hold due to both the shape AND the size. Siri is hands-free for adding to my grocery list and so on. So many upgrades from the 6 in such an affordable package!

Any other SE lovers here? I know it's been out for a little while, and new phone announcements are just around the corner, but I am giddy about this thing.

mac,These popular applications spy on you,"**Background**

Credit to u/Beerbaron23 for uncovering this for me in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/6vsigo/is_spark_for_mac_using_22_cpu_idle_for_anyone_else/dm3geqj/), in which he discovered ""HockeySDK.framework"" in a popular email application Spark, which was using 20% CPU for me. 

&gt;So they can see where you are, what other apps you have running, your messages, whether you played a VIDEO and what the file name was called, they can tell if your phone is shaking (like your moving around) and actual SCREENSHOTS of your screen on your phone!

&gt;This thing can spy on you when your not connected to the internet, up to 300 logs can be kept till it stops and waits to send the data to them next time you connect.

&gt;You can read up on it's features here: https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Ffr-fr%2Fmagazine%2Fmt793271.aspx&amp;edit-text=

&gt;https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-windows-and-windows-phone/hockeyapp-for-applications-on-windows

&gt;https://www.intertech.com/Blog/building-a-universal-windows-platform-uwp-application-part-6-deployment-and-analytics-w-hockeyapp/

tl;dr, **HockeySDK is a widely used analytics software packaged in popular apps which collects analytics and user metric data without you knowing. It is first and foremost a debugging service for developers, but the ability of developers to use it to track sessions, user metrics, telemetry, deep crash data, and personal information without asking and it being shared with Microsoft is a privacy concern, and more than what users normally expect**

Microsoft's [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/PrivacyStatement) is also clear on how they collect, use and share private information and user metrics. Users familiar with Windows 10 will know they use private information and metrics as part of their business model. 

**edit:** Microsoft also [tells developers](https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/app-management-2/what-data-is-collected-with-the-hockeysdks-2) with regards privacy concerns:
&gt;**Keep in mind that it is your responsibility to not collect personal information as part of the events tracking or crash reports**

**Second edit: Credit to Beerbaron23 again, [look at his comment for more detail.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/6vyelf/these_popular_applications_spy_on_you/dm4c7by/) HockeySDK and its APIs allows developers to access all sorts of private information on your device, so with all apps employing HockeyApp you have to make a valued judgement as to whether you trust the dev with any amount of user metrics and private information tracking.**

&gt;Dev: Instead of UII how would I search my users for a particular name and address?
Hockey Tech: At the page with all crash groups is a button ""Search"" on the top. Click this, then enter ""user_string:QUERY"" or ""contact_string:QUERY"" into the search field and replace QUERY with the email or name you are searching for.
[So yes HockeySDK is not anonymous at all and are clearly data-mining against peoples Full Names/User names and E-mail addresses]


**So which applications use HockeySDK ?** updated

* Spark 
* PDF Expert
* Bear
* Airmail 3
* Skype
* 1Password and the 1Password Helper. 
* Edovia Screens
* wiheads Paste
* iFlicks
* Junecloud Deliveries
* Microsoft OneDrive and Skype for Business
* Evernote
* Skitch
* Adze 
* Air Video Server HD 
* EasyRes 
* Image2icon 
* Magnet 
* Outline 
* Pixelmator
* Readkit 
* Reeder 
* TrailRunner
* Sketch 
* Jettison
* Kalediscope
* RekordBuddy 2
* Beatport Pro
* Boxcrypto
* Papers 3
* Splice
* Current
* Textual 5
* Wunderlist


**How to know if any of your apps outside this list employ HockeySDK**

* Download [EasyFind](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/freeware.html), or your favourite search tool and search for ""hockeyapp"". Finder will not do because EasyFind searches inside app folders and packages. [I've discovered 6 on my device using this.](http://i.imgur.com/9l60Y8z.png)


**How to prevent analytics from being collected, and eliminate the possibility that devs might use it to collect personal information**

* Make a valued judgement as to whether you would like a dev to have access to analytics and the ability to request private information about your device on top of that via an API. Most devs use it to improve their device. Some devs are trustworthy, some aren't. As a rule of thumb, beware small indie devs bringing gifts (freeware). Decide whether you think your devs are going to abuse it. Most well known devs *wouldn't*. But they *could*. 

* The first line of defence is simply to ask your app (if it contains HockeySDK) to turn off app usage analytics. This is available in PDF Expert, but not in Airmail for example. I still do not trust apps not to send usage analytics though, but it's better than doing nothing.

* Use LittleSnitch to find and block connections going to the HockeySDK server.

* **For the easiest solution**, add this to your hosts file:

    gate.hockeyapp.net/*/track

* Use Adguard Desktop enabling its [built in Spyware Filter.](http://i.imgur.com/sc5bill.png). This filter rule is NOT in the EasyList privacy list. Quite interesting that it has been included in Adguard's own spyware filter, and it's part of the reason why I'm posting. 

^I'm ^shamelessly ^plugging ^this ^because ^it ^blocks ^a ^lot ^of ^other ^spyware/analytic ^servers ^OS ^wide ^which ^we ^don't ^even ^know ^about. ^The ^lifetime ^subscription ^is ^also ^$9 ^on ^their ^Russian ^language ^site.


**Why this is bad**

* Devs with the employ of Hockey API can use the SDK as a middleman to request all sorts of private, device, folder information. [Read u/Beerbaron23's comment for an insight into what devs can do with the API.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/6vyelf/these_popular_applications_spy_on_you/dm4c7by/)
* Application of UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifier) with user metrics and crash data mean that devs and third parties have an ability to fingerprint devices.
* Collecting such information without the enduser knowing is a privacy concern in of itself. Microsoft says beta testing is time costly, but this is a clear breach of what users would normally expect. 
* Information is stored on a Microsoft backend, so your private data and whatever devs might want to collect may be at risk and fall under Microsoft's own privacy policy. They have been known to use and monetise user metrics and private data so that in itself is also a privacy concern. 



Visit r/Privacy for safeguarding your Mac against tracking

**tl;dr**: Microsoft owned SDK collects telemetry and user metrics data, and tells developers it is up to them not to collect personal data as parts of events tracking. Developers can use the API to request all sorts of private information on top of the usual analytics. Microsoft also uses and shares private info and telemetry as part of their business model, like any other big corporation. This alone means that you should add them to your hosts file.",114,189,2017-08-25,AAPL,0.0568580012768507,0.9202929735183716,0.0228490699082613

apple,The iPhone Se has completely changed my perspective about Apple,"I tend to be very critical of the post 2011 apple for what has felt like a serious slowing in creative design and consumer hostile moves, but I have to admit that I was wrong to look down on the SE. 

I switched from a 5S, and it. is. wonderful. Not only is it fast, it offers a fair compromise of features. So while there is no force touch, apple pay is a thing for me now, and it is awesome. I was also taken aback by the nicer rear camera, which was a noticeable upgrade. 

I think that the SE gets really undersold as being a rehashing of an old design, which is admittedly what my complaint was with it before exactly. Now though, my perspective has switched to, ""who cares that its reusing the design?"" This phone is so fast, so sleek, and reminds me why I fell in love with my 5s. 

The battery life, camera, size-in-hand, and apple pay make this phone really incredible IMO. 

Oh, and to top it off, you can get it for $150 with headphones, charging cord, and box on slickdeals. Literally $150 for an insanely snappy one-handed phone that's like a 5s on steroids. 

I love this friggen phone, and honestly, now that I've seen it, I really hope Apple sticks with the design, and just continues to update the hardware.

apple,"Thank you, Apple.","I've had terrible hearing all my life. We're talking really bad hearing. I've had multiple surgeries to try and correct the hearing in both ears, and nothing has worked so far yet. We're still looking at the surgical options, but in the meantime, I've been given hearing aids.

You're probably wondering why I'm posting this here. The reason is because Apple worked with the company that I bought my hearing aids from (GN Hearing, Resound) and they are labeled as ""Made for iPhone""

What that means is that my iPhone sees the hearing aids as hearing aids and I can control them directly from iOS. A quick triple tap of the home button lets me adjust the volume or change the settings, all without going into the manufacturer's app. 

Because I'm getting used to them still, I'm constantly adjusting the settings, and this has made the transition painless and almost enjoyable. I can even use the iPhone as a microphone for my hearing aids, so I can place the iPhone somewhere and it can send sound directly to my hearing aids if I want. I can even stream music or sound from the iPhone directly to my hearing aids as if I was wearing headphones, and it all happens automatically.

**Thank you, Apple. It's this kind of thought that makes your company stand out from the rest.** 


(Yes, I know Apple won't see this, but hopefully someone out there can also appreciate this type of thing. I know it was a surprise for me! If you have Resound Hearing Aids that you bought somewhat recently, go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Accessability -&gt; Hearing and see what you can find under there!)

TLDR: Hearing aids work REALLY well with iPhone and has made the process for a 23 year old getting dual hearing aids much easier and smoother. 

Edit: For those of you curious what the UI looks like, here are some screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/bACrt (This is the iOS 11 beta, I have no idea what it looks like on iOS 10 because I got my hearing aids after iOS 11 beta was released. Sorry!)

apple,Please rethink 911.,"I work as a 911 dispatcher.  With the release of the Apple Watch we saw an extreme uptick in 911 misdials.  While a single misdial in itself is not a big deal, several misdials, especially when a call center is busy can create huge safety issues.

For one thing, it takes time for a dispatcher to process a 911 misdial.  That is time that is not being spent answering an actual emergency.  Secondly, some jurisdictions require officers be dispatched to investigate a misdial to confirm there are no problems where the call originated.  That creates a further strain on your public safety resources.

Recently I came across a [cnet article](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/ios-11s-sos-feature-is-more-than-a-way-to-call-for-help/) that promoted a new feature.  If a button on the iphone is pressed five times, 911 will be dialed.

I am extremely concerned this is only going to make the problem of misdials worse, which in turn, makes communities less safe.  I understand that settings on the phone can be changed, but by default phones and watches are set up in a way that they are most likely to dial 911.  Many users are either too lazy to change the setting, or don't know how.

I would ask that Apple turn this feature off by default.  This way the benefits of the feature can be activated by people who are more vulnerable such as the elderly or those in abusive relationships.

I'm thrilled that Apple recognizes their devices have the ability to serve as lifelines for their owners.  I really wish Apple would take the time to speak with the people answering the calls their devices are making.

apple,[Rant] Bluetooth audio is misunderstood. An audio engineer’s perspective.,"Most people think that Bluetooth as a technology is inferior to wired audio. They think it’s the limited bandwidth, latency and generally the wireless connection. This is incorrect.

Both bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 are fully capable of streaming FLAC files in real time (since bluetooth can do up to 20mbp/s from close range, and 10mbp/s from a few meters away). 

The real reason bluetooth audio devices have lower audio quality is because of the DAC requirement, since bluetooth headphones/speakers have to rely on their own digital-analog conversion. To keep prices low they opt in for cheap DACs and cheap drivers, resulting in lower quality dollar-for-dollar when compared to wired. 

This is why I’m glad Apple is pushing for the removal of the headphone jack and innovating the wireless audio space (AirPods are amazing). Prices will continue to come down as demand increases and wireless audio will be virtually indistinguishable from wired.

This is a necessary push, and the more time passes the more I realized it truly did take “courage”, no matter how many memes are made around that statement.
