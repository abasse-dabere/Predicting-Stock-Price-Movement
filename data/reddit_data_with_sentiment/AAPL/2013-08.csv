1. Didn't find it. Me and the gf looked for hrs. Filed local PD report with serial number. Filed serial number with Apple. Planning on returning Sunday with uncles metal detector and flyers. 

2. Boss was like 'the universe happens man, if I had all the $ from my stupid-shit-escapades ill be way richer'.

Original post ----

This sucks.

I'm two weeks into my first real career-type job. A Digital Media Specialist. I get to take photos and shoot video all day long. It's what I always wanted. After working in cubicles for 17 years...

The company bought me A/V equipment off a list I made myself. My dream gear. 

Included is a MacBook Pro w/ Retina, 16gb RAM, FCPx, the works. I shot all day today. 100 miles away from homebase in the country. It was a long day, far from home.

My last task was to take the company car home, stopping by the Apple store to drop off the MacBook for the weekend. It had a scratch on the screen that was going to be replaced As a one-time courtesy. 

I didn't like the idea of opening the trunk in the mall parking lot  (with my rig and all my equipment for all to see). So I took the laptop out of my rig backpack and set it on the front seat next to me - so when I got to the mall I could hop out, quickly run in and drop off the Mac and be on my way home.

It's a big weekend you see. I just moved from out-of-state to take this job and I move into my uptown apartment tomorrow!

Only I didn't put the laptop on the seat next to me; I set it on the roof of the car, closed the trunk, got in and drove away.  

Somewhere on that gravelly road / ditch next to the road my Mac flew off. It was in a case. Trela, Teva, Travart??? It's black and medium-duty. I couldn't have been going more than 20-30mph...

I realized my mistake 20 miles later and flew back to search, with the sun going down, my iPhone dead, and no clue how to get home (I'm in a new State remember?). Couldn't find anything. 

Headed back at sunrise. Boss comes in at 9:30am. I figure one of 3 things will happen. 

1. Ill find the laptop unharmed in a pile of cow dung = best case scenario
2. Someone has already found the laptop and will open it to see my frantic email, contact me / iCloud will notify me. Midwest-nice shall prevail and it will be promptly returned.
3. I or someone will find the laptop totally smashed and inoperable. 

I think I'm getting fired tomorrow unless maybe my boss will buy a new MacBook and take it, slowly, out of my paycheck... Or a rich uncle will suddenly sworp down and buy a new MacBook for me... Fuck. I'm getting fired in 12hrs....",380.0,803,2013-08-02,AAPL,0.10158544778823853,0.8728196024894714,0.02559499256312847

apple,The AirPort Express is the best router I've ever owned,"Just wanted to share my enthusiasm over the AirPort Express, which I bought as a replacement for the router portion of the modem/router combo Time Warner gave me. 

Anyways, my previous router would constantly drop connection and barely reached my workplace, which obviously was quite annoying. Fed up with all the different fixes I tried, I caved in and bought an AirPort Express. After plugging it in to my wall and connecting it to my cable modem via Ethernet, all I did was go through a setup process that took around a minute. I could immediately tell the difference between the AirPort Express and my old router. 

The Express reaches my workplace perfectly. It doesn't drop connection every 35 minutes. It was so easy to setup. I absolutely love it. And the added ability to connect printers and speakers to it is awesome. Even managing the router is easy, and because it's a dual-band connection, all my devices are working on the AirPort Wi-Fi without any flaws. I've never been more satisfied with a router. Apple's got a winner on their hands.

Intro:
I've never owned a laptop - I've been strictly ""build your own PC"" guy for a while now. I've survived 3 years of university just fine but the demand to get tasks done digitally is rising by the semester. Can't always just go straight home after classes anymore and work at home instead. So, a I guess a laptop is in order. While I may be much more familiar with Windows, Windows 7/8 just fails to serve me in the mobile platform. Add the fact that I can't find that many Windows laptop that is up to the quality that Apple offers. I've played around with laptops for the most of July and it's Mac for me for sure...

There's currently an ongoing sale for the Ivy-Bridge rMBP and Haswell MBA on Best Buy. It is $200 off for the rMBP, and $65 off for the MBA. I also have an additional $100 off for being a student for both laptops. And it then goes to $1,199 for the most basic rMBP (128gb, 8gb RAM, etc.), and $1,134.99 for the MBA (256gb, 4gb RAM, etc.). I'm pretty sure that I'm not in the chase for the Haswell rMBP because it won't have the Back to School sale, and the $300 off is very justified for me to skip the next gen because I don't really see any significant upgrade on the next one aside a slight performance boost/battery-life, and 802.11ac (but do correct me if you want to).

mac,Need advise on strategy for buying a new Macbook Pro.,"I need to buy a new Macbook Pro but have timing issues that makes the decision of when to buy kind of tricky.

I'd like to wait until the next batch of Macbook Pros to either buy a new one, or to buy one from the current crop that would likely come available at a discount.

I currently have an Early 2008 15"" MBP that I use for general use and video editing and effects work.  I use Final Cut Pro 7 and Adobe CS6 products.  Before anyone lambastes me for using FCP 7, it's what we use at work on our Mac Pro systems and I want to be able to work at home on my laptop.

I'm currently running Lion on my laptop.  My employer is also running Lion on the Mac Pros but there's a plan to upgrade to Mountain Lion soon.

So, my thinking is that since Mavericks is due to come out this year, it's likely that the next batch of Macbook Pro models will come with Mavericks installed, and that it's not likely to be compatible with FCP 7.  Additionally, there's probably potential that once Mavericks is released, the current crop of Macbook Pros might also come off of the assembly line with Mavericks installed.  If that happens, I'm guessing I could move backward to Mountain Lion on the current crop of machines, but not on the new models.

So what do you think?  Is the Haswell chip worth waiting for, would current machines be discounted enough to warrant the wait or should I just take action and buy now?  Any insight on any aspects of this post is appreciated.

I'm not sure if I've explained this very well, so my apologies.

apple,A Working Fix for Battery Life on iOS7.,"Okay, check it out. From Macrumors forum user ""Jare"": ""A Developer's Fix for battery life on iOS 7"". I gave it a shot yesterday and it works perfect. I'm currently at 15 hours standby and 1.5 hours usage (hbogo over wifi), 100% brightness and my battery is chillin' at 96%.

&gt;I know a lot of you are complaining about battery life, so I've decided to make this thread and point out how you can get your battery life back to what it was, if not even better then when you were running iOS 6. I'll keep updating this as a filter through log files.
It's not an easy process, and it took a little bit of reading through log files and testing to figure this out. Please follow this advice carefully.
This will fix 99.9% of your battery problems. I've fully tested this myself with several devices (including older generations)
Instructions: (Each instruction has an explanation below, the numbers do not signify any form of order)

* **1) Install each beta as NEW.**

* **2) Sign out of all signed in services (see below for list), then sign back in.**

* **3) Location services (if turned on): Disable Popular, Frequent Locations, Location iAds, WiFi Networking.**

* **4) Turn off Bluetooth unless needed.**

* **5) Do not use the new ""live"" wallpapers.**

* **6) Turn off ""Background App Refresh""**


User friendly explanations:


* 1) Avoid OTA updating the betas.. but if you must, reset all media/content via General -&gt; Reset. The way iOS 7 handles OTA updates may cause some compatibility issues if you've already installed apps, services, etc. Fresh install without OTA/backup is the fix at the moment.


* 2) This will clear any IdentityServices issues. Currently iOS 7 has a bug with authentication/identity services which clears after logging in and out, then back in. You may sign in again once ALL services are signed out.


* 3) This will clear out LocationServices bugs on first use. Right now iOS 7's geofencing and other location services (including the new ones) are not working right and WILL drain your battery. This fixes that issue while still giving you nearly full location services access.


* 4) Since iOS 6 Bluetooth is automatically enabled (with no icon) and you must manually turn it off.


* 5) Yes, the new wallpapers are battery hogs. Right now, they cause severe drain and logging issues (As seen under diagnostics) so for now, stick with a standard wallpaper. By the time iOS 7 is out, I'm sure this will be fixed.

* 6) Currently not working as intended, instead leaving apps completely running as code is not optimized. Turn this off and you will notice a huge improvement (and wont affect multitasking!).

Also there's some interference when the headphone cable is near the laptop, probably because it's a coiled cord. Any mods I can do to improve the electrical shielding around the 3.5mm port?

Here is the solution for the rest of us who don’t want to program. What I finally did was this:
1. Go to About this mac under the apple in the upper left and click on More info
2. Click on system report
3. make a note of what it says after Model Identifier
4. go to your master drive – System -Library – Extensions – IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext -Contents – Plugins – ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext – Contents – Resources – find the name from step 3 and move it to a folder that you can find again if needed.

I use it to stream Netflix, MLB and Hulu as well. However, with friends over, we literally have to determine an order when we're sharing videos with each other because we love airplay so much.

mac,Been saving all summer to buy a mac laptop for college but I've hit a slight roadblock,"I love Apple to death, I own a good amount of their products, including a 21.5in 2.5ghz 8gb ram iMac, but it is time for me to go off to college and so I have been looking into the mac laptops, the only problem is I am an engineering student and I have been told that I will be using a lot of PC programs (slight problem).  The reason I am such a die hard mac fan is since I was a little kid I have filmed and photographed everything and I plan on continuing to do such in the future.  Mac just makes it so easy to organize and edit everything I make.  Now I have heard mac can run windows but I have never had experience with this or really seen it in action.  Is it harsh on the machine?  Meaning will I loose performance? And will it actually run PC programs if windows is installed?  Thanks

iphone,Went to apple yesterday to have my phone replaced. Curious what Apple uses to diagnose problems.,"So after months of waiting around to get my phone replaced, due to hardware failure of the lock button, I finally went to the apple store. I have had the iPhone since the launch of the original and have had multiple replacements throughout the years. Yesterday was the first time I saw a genius employee put my phone into a diagnostic mode and I wasn't able to catch how she did it. From what I saw she connected my phone to a wireless network and BAM my diagnostic information was displayed on the iPad she had in front of her. She didn't go into much detail but basically said I had a few software errors appearing as well which didn't surprise me.


So I'm just curious. 
 Does any one know how the diagnostics works or have any details on what it is doing?",3.0,6,2013-08-15,AAPL,0.09136247634887695,0.8768134117126465,0.03182409331202507

I never use my original iPad now because it is so big and bulky and awkward to carry around and use, so I think the mini would be a big upgrade there. Are they planning on coming out with a iPad mini 2 or something soon?

I'm also probably going to get rid of the old iPad, what would be the best method of selling it? How much can I expect to get for it (only wifi capabilites)? Can I trade it in at the apple store for a discounted mini?

mac,Disappearing Storage Space on Macbook Air,"Not too long ago I bought a new MBA.

Counting all the pre-installed Apps and OS, I started off with something around 101GB of free storage space according to ""About this Mac"" window.

I keep my computers very clean. I don't install anything unnecessary, I don't keep any media locally stored. Any movies, pictures or other files that I imported to the mac were subsequently uploaded to some online service and then deleted from the mac.

I also regularly restart the mac, restart apps, empty the trash and use CleanGeniusPro to keep the mac as light weight as possible.

I've gone through so many menues and finder search options but I can't find the solution to my problem:

My mac's storage space keeps slowly diminishing. Even after removing GarageBand which I never use I barely recovered any space on this mac. One day I reboot and I only have 99GB left. A week later its 98 and now its inching towards 97.

In all this time I haven't installed any new files.

""About this mac"" tells me that there are over 3.3GB in movies on my computer. No matter what I try, I can't find those movies. Do they perhaps belong to iMovie's built-in library?

What can I do to stop my storage space from getting smaller and smaller?

EDIT: Just went through the finder again. Viewed my pictures category by list and turned on file sizes. Turns out that my iPhoto library is 3.3GB large. Exactly the size that ""About this mac"" declares as movie files. How do I empty this out? My iphoto library is totally empty.

EDIT2: Found it. Went into the iPhoto application folder and dug my way through to the Masters folder. It kept two huge movies I had imported from my camera in the past. Just kept it there. Without any purpose. Even though I had deleted it in the past. Took up 3.35 GB. For no damn reason.

I finally gave in and purchased the Crucial M4 128GB SSD off of Amazon for great deal ($90) as well as the hard drive caddy for the superdrive. I have been searching around looking for the best way to go about the process of having the two drives on my Mac. 

First, i am currently running the latest developer preview of 10.9 Mavericks. Personally, how would you peeps go about managing the two drives? With the SSD+HDD could i put the OS on the SSD and have my large libraries on my HDD? Or, if possible, would it be wiser to attempt the DIY Fusion Drive so that i wouldn't have to manage both drives? Which leads me to my next question. If i do go the DIY Fusion route does anyone have any tips on installing 10.9? Or would i start at 10.8.4 and then upgrade as i did in the past?

I am sure i am missing other things to ask you guys. Would appreciate any and all advice. 
 
Other small questions:
Do i enable trim? 
Clean install or clone to the SSD?
Best spot for the SSD main HDD area or the optical bay?

Thanks in advanced! Cheers!

SSD and the hard drive  caddy should be arriving today. I will report back with details.",18.0,5,2013-08-17,AAPL,0.020674025639891624,0.919321596622467,0.06000442057847977

mac,3ware-Controller and Kernel Panic,"Hi all, 

i recently switched as a long time Windows-User to MacOS and everything went really well and im satisfied as hell with MacOS. Only Problem is my 3ware-9650SE controller with 4 attached 2TB drives in a RAID5. During migration i could use the Storage fine (first i needed to install the 3ware kext to get it recognized). The storage was formatted with NTFS so it was read only and just worked - i knew i can't write OOTB to a NTFS formatted drive. 

Later i tried out Paragon to enable write and here the trouble began: after installing Paragon, MacOS immediately crashed upon mounting the drive. I thought myself, it must be the Paragon driver and decided to Swap from NTFS to HSF+. It was a pain in the ass to safe all data (around 4TB) to external drives. After i did that and wanted to re-partition the drive... immediately kernel panic. So its nothing about the filesystem, it must be the 3Ware-Driver i guess? Again: reading is just fine, just writing seems to makes the problem.

Right now I have a 2012 MacBook Air, and a 2011 Mac Mini along with an iPad. I have quite a few laptops and phones in my home as well which are always connected to the Wi-Fi network. 

The only Wi-Fi ac hardware i have right now with me is my HTC One, but by the end of next year, this figure will surely jump to around 5 or 6.

I was looking at the ASUS AC66U which has an external USB port. I read somewhere that I can connect an external HDD to it, and using some hackery, enable wireless Time Machine backups for both my devices. However, I am not sure how elegant this solution is, and whether it actually works or not. 

If not the ASUS AC66U, then what are my other options? I cannot buy the latest gen Wi-Fi ac Apple Airport since its not available in India. My best bet will be to buy the last gen Airport from Apple.

So I put the DVD drive back and swap the hd for the ssd.  It's great and I probably don't need two TB of storage anyway.  Just wondering why things would work this way.

mac,Dual Drive: Should I move the Home Folder or just certain folders and point to them?,"I just caddy installed an SSD in my MBP (mid-2012). Now there's a 120GB SSD in the main bay with a freshly installed OS and a completely empty 500GB HDD in the caddy (the drive that came with the system originally). I'm planning on doing the whole boot drive + storage drive thing. I've seen [this](http://chris.pirillo.com/how-to-move-the-home-folder-in-os-x-and-why/) saying to just relocate the whole Home folder. There's also this [this other](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/06/21/using-os-x-with-an-ssd-plus-hdd-setup/) guide that leaves the actual Home folder on the primary drive. I think I agree with the notion of leaving the Home folder on the main drive makes some sense for performance (caches, etc.) Ultimately, I don't know what would be most effective? All of the pointing to new places etc. in the second choice seems like there's more to go wrong. Then again, having the whole Home folder on a different (slower) drive also seems wrong to me. Halp, what do? I want my application on the SSD for performance, and general files on the HDD for space. I mean, iTunes should stay on the SSD, but the media should be stored on the HDD, right?

Ideally, I was thinking a pair of the Ecoute mobile and desktop app, but unfortunately the desktop app does not manage libraries on it's on--rather it mirrors the iTunes library. I was hoping to ditch iTunes altogether.
I've tried sonora and liked the desktop UI, sure there are a couple things that could be tweaked but ultimately the functionality is very basic. Something that syncs to an independent app of the built in music app on the iPhone/iPod over wifi would be great.

mac,Mac Duty Cycle?,"I'm a Windows support tech. I've been debating about buying a Mac for personal use for some time and I am wondering if some of my logic for staying with Windows is flawed.

For the last decade or so, every computer I have bought was a Dell. I buy Dell because they are cheap. I get two to three years out of them and never pay more than $600 for them. Clearly, I don't buy the latest and greatest simply because I don't see the point. At the rate technology advances, the stuff on the shelf is out of date when you buy it. I reason that the $200 or so a year that these machines cost me, my ROI is far greater because of the money I make using the machines and the entertainment value that I get from them makes them money makers.

I'm curious if I could realistically expect to get more life out of a Mac if I were shell out $2000 for one. Obviously, when I replace my machines they aren't completely worn out and they are often repurposed. 

For something that sees daily use, would I begin to hate life if I tried to use the same machine for 5 years (brining my yearly costs down to what my current machines are at) with the same image?

My primary reason for switching would be to learn new technology. I haven't used a Mac since middle school. I do use iOS daily, though.",31.0,8,2013-08-23,AAPL,0.03201853483915329,0.9265679717063904,0.04141348600387573

iphone,"Studying abroad, how to keep Verizon Unlimited Data?","Hi there /r/iPhone! I'm a frequent browser of your cousin subreddit, /r/Jailbreak, but I think you guys would be best in answering this question for me.

I'm going to be studying abroad in England for the upcoming fall semester. Currently, I am a US resident with an iPhone 4S on the Verizon network. I'm looking for the easiest way to be able to use my iPhone overseas. From the research I've done, it seems that the best way is to get a prepaid SIM plan (after unlocking my phone) and using a British cell phone plan for the 3 months that I will be there.

However, I've run into a bit of a hitch. My Verizon plan is grandfathered into having unlimited data, something I certainly don't want to lose. I'm worried that if I switch to a British cell plan for those 3 months, and therefore go off my Verizon plan, I will no longer have my unlimited data when I return.

Just to note, if there were a way to be under two plans at once, I would have no problem paying for both my Verizon plan as well as a British plan for my semester. That way, I could continue to pay Verizon and keep my unlimited data, but also have access to a British plan which would be *far* less expensive to call/text/use data. Is something like this even possible?

Does anyone have any experience with/advice for doing something like this? I've heard of being able to ""freeze"" your current Verizon plan, but again, I'm afraid of risking losing my unlimited data plan.

I do have a backup plan. I have an old Droid 2 Global that I could unlock and put on a British cell plan if need be, using that as my main phone during my stay. However, I love my iPhone, as I know you all do, and I want to be able to use it if possible.

Thank you in advance for your help. Also, does anyone recommend any specific British phone plan? Vodafone seems to have the best one that I've seen; it's a [SIM plan for 10 pounds/month that gets you 150 calling minutes, unlimited texts, and 250MB worth of data.](https://freesim.vodafone.co.uk/freedom-sim-card?tracker=58f8dj)",8.0,9,2013-08-25,AAPL,0.03214884176850319,0.9269060492515564,0.04094512760639191

It's been restored to factory settings so there isn't any contact info either.  I feel like it will just sit and collect dust at a police station, as Verizon said it was reported stolen over a year ago.  I want to personally make sure it gets returned.

Update:
Okay, so I went to the Apple Store and they said there was nothing they could do.  Even if the serial number were to be tracked to an owner, no one from the store would be allowed to contact him/her because of their strict policies regarding privacy.

apple,What you need to do as an iPhone owner by an AppleCare advisor,"Just thought I would give some pointers as Apple ventures into a new ""era"" if you will...

1) Make sure you KNOW your Apple ID and password (please please please please please please please please please do this before iOS 7, you WILL regret it if this is not done). If you cannot remember your apple ID and/or password, go to iforgot.apple.com BEFORE calling AppleCare. Your life will be so much easier. Also, visit appleid.apple.com, set up a recovery email, add alternate email addresses etc.

2) Back up your content to iTunes/your computer. Oh, the 2000 pictures you lost were very important to you but didn't back them up/import them to your computer? There is nothing on Apple's end that we can do for you (I do not mean this in a bad way, but we get these calls and we have no resources to help you). Things break, that includes iPhones.

3) Buy the AppleCare Protection Plan +. Seriously. One time payment of $99 gets you extended warranty, unlimited phone support, AND it covers cracked screens and liquid damage. If Apple really wanted to make money off of AC+, they would make you pay monthly just like almost every other insurance plan

4) Speaker is not working? Your sleep/wake button is no longer functional? You have tons of system wide issues? Restore the phone (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414) BEFORE calling AppleCare. ""Why do I have to do the restore before calling y'all, that sounds gay!"" Well, restoring the phone means that if it is a software issue then it will be taken care of. If the restore does not work, then we can move onto hardware isolation.

5) Turn on iCloud and location services. ""HALP I LOST MY IPHONE FIND IT FOR ME""...""Did you turn on iCloud and location services""...""NO I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TRACKING ME""...""Then I can't help you out today"". Fin.

6) Turn your phone off then on again. Seriously. People do not even turn their phones off anymore. Most issues can be resolved by turning on and off the phone. If you go weeks without turning your phone off, you are going to have serious issues.

Do all these things, and you will most likely never have to contact AppleCare.",59.0,85,2013-08-27,AAPL,0.08078712970018387,0.8907992243766785,0.028413714841008186
