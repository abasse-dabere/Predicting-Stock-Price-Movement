apple,"Stolen iPad Update, I got it back!","Link to original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/808oqr/ipad_stolen_find_my_ipad_shows_its_in_a_really/

After a couple days my iPad found it's way near a sketchy business center. One of those stores was a sketchy electronics store. I left the iPad on lost mode and left a message saying that the iPad had been reported stolen and that wireless service had been disconnected (which was a lie) in hopes that they wouldn't turn off the device so I could continue to track it. Seemed to have worked.

I went in asking a girl that worked there if they sold used iPads and she said yes but had to wait for the manager. I came back 30 minutes later and the manager said there were none for sale to which the girl said 'what about the small gray one?' (my exact model). Manager claimed it was broken and not for sale, wouldn't even let me see it, but I didn't want to be too forward or else he'd suspect it was mine. So I leave the store kinda frustrated.

I called the police, an officer arrives 45 minutes later and we walk in together. I sound the alarm and *ding* *ding* *ding* rings through the store. Cop retrieves my iPad and files a police report with the manager. Manager was too ashamed to look my way, f**ker.

So if you find your apple device in a public place, get an officer to escort you as you sound the alarm. It felt so good to get back after having it go missing 5 days ago.",112,1873,2018-03-02,AAPL,0.3627736270427704,0.6084345579147339,0.028791753575205803

apple,I wrote a script that doubles my battery life!,"I like to develop in Unity/VS Code on the couch/on the go and even with a brand new battery, my 6 year old mbp only gets ~2 hours (I can get 5-6 if I only code) even with gfxCardStatus set to Integrated Only. Now most of the time (2/3rds? 3/4ths?) I am just coding, so Unity is running in the background chewing up battery for no reason. I could just shut down Unity when I'm not using it, but then I am less likely to test my code and iterate.

But as I was looking at the Energy tab in Activity Monitor, I saw this column: App Nap. That's the feature that suspends the app when it is not in use (or something like that). But Unity (along with many apps) does not support it. So I did some searching and cobbled together enough bits from StackOverflow to make my own app nap script.

Introducing [MyAppNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap), ~~just fire up Terminal, type 'python myAppNap.py Unity' and it will suspend that app when it is not in focus and resume it once it is.~~ Check out [ForceNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap/releases/tag/v0.4) if you are brave or wait a few more days or until it is stable.

It's free and open source and should not require anything extra (runs on the python that comes with Mac OS). Though I've only tested this on Sierra on a 2012 15"" rMBP, so if you run into any issues, let me know! This is the first script I've written that's meaningfully useful. I now can get roughly 4-5 hours of battery life while working with Unity every once in a while.

*TLDR* If you are running some battery-hogging-app that you use intermittently but want to keep open, give [MyAppNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap) a try.

/Self-promotion Saturday

Edit&gt; I didn't expect this to take off! I'm really happy for all the interest and I'll look into making it more user friendly, put it in a menu bar, maybe prepopulate a list of all your apps so you can just select one (or more?) at a time.

Edit2&gt; I haven't had time to go through all the comments yet, but thank you all for your support! I have merged with a couple of enhancements from the community. Now it will suspend all defocused apps if invoked with no arguments, or suspend multiple apps if invoked with multiple app names. Up next: integrate with Rumps and turn it into an app, so anyone download it, open it, and select the apps they want to suspend without going into Terminal.

Edit3&gt; March 4th PST 17:33 I've been coding all day and have pushed a lot of updates. The repo isn't too steady right now so please hold off on using it unless you have more experience with Python than me (I just took an intro to python course a couple months back). I am getting help from the community, signed on a collaborator, and have a rudimentary status bar app version working (very experimental, lots of bugs). I'll update again with a better estimate on when a user friendly version will be released. Again, thanks for all the support.

**RELEASE UPDATE**
Edit4&gt; March 4th PST 23:20 Just managed to build a status bar version, I call it: [ForceNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap/releases/tag/v0.4). It is still experimental, don't use it unless you're ok with your apps hanging if you look at it the wrong way. Works with multiple apps at once, one unsafe way to quit, still pretty rough around the edges.

iphone,iPhone X is my best phone experience so far,"Hello Everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts about the iPhone X. It's basically the best phone experience I've ever had. Literally.

I'm was an heavy Android user and I started to get interested into Apple shortly after I owned the first Google Pixel. I was like, if Google tries to mimic Apple, why not try Apple after all ? I bought an iPhone 7 plus and sold my Pixel at that time because I just loved how smooth, snappy and good the iPhone was. I was literally in love and each morning opening my iPhone 7+ felt like opening a brand new device, even after 1 year of use

Then the Google Pixel 2 was out. I bought it at launch because I'm still an Google fan but quickly regreted my choice. As soon as I was back on Android, tapping the multitasking button like some 20th century plebeian, looking at the less impressive display, using bugged Apps / not optimized, I started feeling incomplete. Something was missing. The digital life that I had with iPhone up until that point, felt so well rounded so smooth that going back after 1 year was feeling like eating my own vomit

So I decided to sell both the Pixel 2 and my iPhone 7+ to get an iPhone X and man, I have never feel so comfortable using a phone.

The kinetic pleasure is INSANE. I just love how everything moves, you don’t feel like pressing a screen and looking for buttons to press anymore. You just swipes and make your fingers dance and everything moves smoothly and snappy. It’s truly beautiful.

The screen is just amazing. The notch for me is an absolute non-issue, I love how the screen looks with it and I don’t even pay attention to it anymore after 6 days of use, it’s just part of my iPhone

Apple made a beautiful product and it’s just the best phone experience I’ve ever had

apple,Feeling pretty ripped off by not being able to watch any 4k content on my 5k IMac.,"Buyers beware, the IMac does not work as a 4k entertainment center despite being capable and having a fantastic display. I got the IMac 5k with the Radeon 580 and  solid state drive. I planned on using to edit videos, daily stuff, gaming, and as my main tv/movie source. After booting it up, I was pretty excited to plug in my headphones and watch my first movie in 4k, only to find out that Apple limits all 4k content to the new Apple TV. When I go to purchase or rent movies in Itunes it limits to 1080p. It blocks 4k content from Amazon and Netflix as well. 

I'm probably going to return this thing and get a comparable PC, 4k display, and a 4k Amazon fire stick that I can plug right into the display. 

Anybody else bummed about this? Any word on workarounds (besides pirating)?

apple,Macbook Pro 2016 3rd butterfly keyboard replacement,"Today I got back my Macbook Pro from Apple. This is the 3rd time in one year that they repair it because of keyboard issues.

The spacebar gets stuck, some keys don't respond randomly... happens just after a month or two of use... But especially it's the spacebar, the intro and the backspace.

Apple changed the ""top case"" which means that they changed the battery also (and it only had 36 cycles this time), and they do this no questions asked. You just have to make the trip and talk to them. Really, no questions asked.

Will Apple ever recognise that the butterfly mechanism is deffective and start replacing them? What should I do? I spent 2300€ on this machine and the new one costs now 2800€.

apple,I think an AppleCare employee is trying to steal my Apple ID and Personal info,"I called about a simple issue with my homepod. He insisted on screen sharing with all my devices and collecting log data because it would help them identify and fix this rare problem. Issue is: he kept asking me to do things repeatedly on my devices that would allow him to see me log into my Apple ID (using iPad and iPhone onscreen keyboards). He calls me persistently to check in and try to collect more log data. He’s even asked me to open my photos app. What gets suspicious is that I just had an unauthorized login attempt on my Apple ID from a city I used to live in (that still happens to be on file as my address with Apple).  Luckily, I caught it with 2-factor authentication. I’ve changed my password and device passcodes. Is there anything else I should do?

There’s a lot more to this but I’m too lazy and tired to type it up right now. Am I just being paranoid?

Update:
Apple rep has confirmed it was an actual AppleCare employee and tells me that he finds quite a few things about this very troubling. Namely: not pausing screen share for passwords and asking to see my photos app despite it having no bearing on the issue at hand. They have referred the issue to management who will now conduct an investigation.",92,666,2018-03-10,AAPL,0.0773492157459259,0.9009711146354675,0.021679619327187538

apple,Flutter for iOS is nearing takeoff!,"Hey reddit!

You may recall a couple of months ago I posted about a new and beautiful twitter app that I was working on called Flutter, I just wanted to update my progress on that. The list of features is ever-growing, with more added every day.

I've been working on this almost every day for 5/6 months now and am nearing a stage where it's almost feature-complete and just ironing out a bunch of bugs and crashes (push notifications are currently a hit or miss, works great when they do, but seldom do).

You can see how the app looks and more here: https://imgur.com/a/N5hUJ

And you can follow for progress on my twitter @JPEGuin: https://twitter.com/JPEGuin

And you can sign up for the beta if you'd like to try it out for yourself here: https://flightbase-twitter.herokuapp.com

A small list of testimonials from current users include:

*""Looks extremely clean. I love being able to adjust text size and night mode without going to a different page. Also really dig force touch to love/retweet! It doesn't seem like something that would make a difference but not having the little icons below each tweet is so visually pleasing to me.""*

*""Love the app! Very well put together. I love the beautiful menu that pops up when you long press a tweet that lets your RT or like a tweet.""*

*""Man this is looking slick. I’ve tried a lot of Twitter apps for iOS and have basically settled on Tweetbot as my client of choice, but so far Flutter is definitely looking like a contender to topple TB.""*

*""It’s like Apollo for Twitter, nice job man!""*

*""Holy shit. One fast app, the default twitter app takes for ever to open and is slow. So far I’m liking it a lot!""*

*""I absolutely love the dark mode and looks stunning on my iPhone 8 Plus. This is how dark mode should be, congratulations man! Being able to change the app icon is wonderful.""*

*""I will be using this as my daily twitter client from now on.""*

*""The interface is absolutely beautiful, and I am definitely going to be using this over the stock twitter app!""*

*""You are killing it! This is really becoming one powerful Twitter client.""*

*""This is shaping up to be “community” twitter app. Everything on everyone’s wish lists, that most apps don’t dare to do.""*

I'd love to know what you think, and how I could improve further!

apple,Recently switched from Spotify to Apple Music and the music recommendation has been underwhelming,"So I recently hopped on to apple music to try it out since there was a 3 month trial. I have been a long time Spotify fan. I mainly listen to metal and specifically metalcore, melodic death metal, heavy metal and likewise. Considering my taste in music Spotify has been bang on in suggesting me new music to listen to particular to my exact taste. I use online streaming services to discover new music since the songs I listen to regularly I already have them downloaded on my phone. So for this Spotify has always been perfect. So I have few questions about Apple Music.

1) It's curated playlist lacks in comparison to Spotify. So like the metalcore playlist on Spotify has 64 songs all with handpicked new music which I have never heard while the Metalcore playlist on apple music has 49 songs in which 80% are songs that are quite old which I have already listened to. So it gives me like 5-10 songs which I have not heard so that's very less compared to Spotify. Also in metal itself Spotify has playlist for Deathcore, Trash metal, progressive metal, folk metal etc which are absolute top quality.I am finding it diificult to search similar playlist in the app. How do I do that?

2) ‎I have already transferred my playlist from Spotify to Apple music which I am happy to report that all the songs were available on Apple music. But the thing is that in the for you tab it's suggesting me metal albums to listen to (which is good compared to Google music which suggests me bullshit music which i don’t even listen to) but I want it to suggest me individual songs not whole albums, any way to do that?

3) ‎Discover Weekly is another absolute gem which allows me to discover new music every week. And the collection of songs on it is so accurate to my taste in metal (metalcore and melodic death) that it's scary Spotify is so good at knowing what I want to listen to. Does it have a similar feature that I can use? 

4) Spotify has a Release Radar playlist which contains brand new releases for the artist I care about. This is amazing again for discovering brand new music. Any similar feature on Apple Music that I can use?

5) How do I change the music quality that I want to listen to? I cant seem to find an option to change it in settings.

So are there any ways that I can replicate these features on Apple Music? It would be amazing if I could considering that apple music is extremely cheap for me comparatively.

Also let me clarify I am not criticising any service at all. Infact i am grateful for apple music being as cheap as it is. I am asking suggestions on how to make the service better for my personal requirements.",102,419,2018-03-18,AAPL,0.0369349829852581,0.9264470934867859,0.036617886275053024

apple,Beware: Micro Center is advertising 2.9 GHz Touch Bar MBPs and putting 2.6 GHz in the box.,"Went to my local Micro Center yesterday morning to advantage of a seemingly great deal: Apple MBP 15""2.9I7/16G/1T TB SG for $2,299.99

http://www.microcenter.com/product/505051/MBP_1529I7-16G-1T_TB_SG

Only the Serial #, Part #, and Model # (A1707) are on the outside of the brown box that Micro Center gives you. When I broke the seal, there was a 2.6 GHz late 2016 model, which is technically also A1707.

The receipt also lists the MacBook Pro as being 2.9 GHz. The manager claims it was a ""typo"" (on both the website and receipt) and all the SKUs (729897) are 2.6 GHz, and reassured me that it was ""still a good deal."" I checked the Serial #s of multiple boxes and found they were all 2.6 GHz.

This deal was available all over the US, and I'm sure there are a lot of unsuspecting people this weekend who bought it. It's been almost 2 days since the manager notified Micro Center of the ""typo"" and it still hasn't been corrected.

If you're an Apple fan and bought this over the weekend, please double-check your new laptop.",58,475,2018-03-19,AAPL,0.017049266025424004,0.8750302791595459,0.10792048275470734

speed: incredibly fast, just like my SE. switching apps was far more responsive on the X, tho…

Haptic feedback, wow. What apple has done here is impressive. The phone gives you a tap instead of a vibration. The vibrations don't feel overwhelming, unlike my SE, which feels like its going to vibrate my hands off, or make my desk feel like its going to come apart at any moment.
Can't believe other phone companys haven't stolen this yet.

3d touch, my phone feels old and outdated now. Its so amazing to me that I can start a new document on pages from my home screen. And open the app by putting more pressure on it.

sound: full, loud, and no distortion. Good as always.

It would be nice if Reminders had the option of all-day events. Easier to input times instead of pressing many buttons to set a time. A checklist inside a reminder. Tags would be nice.

apple,"Now that Apple is so well know for upholding privacy, they should introduce Travel Mode.","These days border crossing agents are searching phones, and you don’t have a choice to consent. It’s usually give consent or don’t come in. Apple should give an option to hide things like truecrypt or 1password’s travel mode. Choose the apps/photos/app data you want to hide encrypted/hidden or delete and allow the data to be restored from iCloud after.  I think they can do it both ways.

1. Encrypt and hide the data from anywhere (home screen/storage settings etc) but if everyone knows how to disable travel mode then the agent will know, unless they do the truecrypt thing where a different password at the lock screen can disable the mode. Allow certain data only to stay hidden so the agents won’t be suspicious an app eg. messenger or wechat or photos are blank.

2.just upload (selective)app data into iCloud and delete it locally entirely so no trace of it will be on the device. The app will still be there with some data but not all of it making it less suspicious. 

That way if they look, the items will be hidden or not there so the agents can’t ask for it. In order to turn off this mode, one would have to enter a password different than their unlock password at the unlock screen. They can't even know if your mode exists because your passcode will still unlock the phone. That’d be awesome for privacy and what Apple stands for.",139,386,2018-03-29,AAPL,0.03884201496839523,0.9303736686706543,0.03078432008624077

Additionally, she said Micro Center reviewed the constructive feedback from /r/apple, and apologized that it had taken so long to correct this mistake. They are looking into changing a few of their procedures so this doesn't happen again, especially since customer service is a priority for them in the era of online retail.

My thanks to the individuals within company that took this seriously and are trying to improve the system!
