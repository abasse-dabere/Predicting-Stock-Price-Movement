apple,Update: I was the one falsely accused of shoplifting at an Apple Store earlier this month.,"Hey everyone,

I thought I'd give everyone an update on what came out of [my situation earlier this month](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/55as44/where_to_report_apple_store_experience/), when security personnel falsely accused me of shoplifting at the Santa Monica Apple Store.



First, I'd like to thank everyone who gave advice and support. I had no idea my post would have blown up like that; truthfully I thought I'd get a phone number or two, or an email address, and that would be that.


After receiving the direction you all provided, I did manage to speak with a case manager at Customer Relations with Apple corporate shortly after I posted here. She got on the ball immediately, took thorough notes about what happened, and promised to make this right.


However, it seems like even Customer Relations couldn't get the store to cooperate. After nearly 4 weeks of back and forth phone calls, the case manager informed me today that she had to close out my case. The best she could explain as far as a resolution was that the store promised that they were looking into the matter, but that's as much as she could do. 


I believe the Santa Monica store has no intention of resolving this matter. They swept me under the rug the first time, and every time the case manager tried to get us on a conference call, they were never available. 


If they hadn't lost my business already, they certainly have now, and I will be returning the case in question to the store tomorrow. I can't in good conscience let them keep the revenue that came from that incident.


Again, thank you to everyone who provided support and advice a few weeks ago. Apple's Customer Relations department and the store itself may have let me down, but you all didn't!",445,3683,2016-11-01,AAPL,0.057952843606472015,0.8984946012496948,0.04355250671505928

apple,So many Apple Store employees have no idea you can self checkout via the Apple Store app. Shouldn’t they at least be aware in order to avoid shoplifting accusations? Are they aware?,"I just left the Apple Store near me.  This is the third time I’ve been there in the last month, each time I’ve purchased an accessory in store from my iPhone app.  

Twice I’ve had two separate employees approach me as I was walking out with my smallish items.  (iPhone Dock and Powerbeats 3) They seemed a bit apprehensive.  I informed them I’d already checked out via the app.

They both replied with ‘What? That is SO cool, i didn’t know you could do that!’ 

Shouldn’t there at least be some kind of in store PSA saying - hey - customers probably aren’t walking out with merchandise since they can pay for it on their app! 

It kind of makes me apprehensive about using this service because I don’t want to have to prove this kind of stuff to employees or whatever.

apple,"Picked up the new 13"" MacBook Pro, here's a short review.","Alright I had originally picked up the 2015 15"" MacBook Pro, and for a few reasons decided to exchange for the newer model 13"". Sorry of this review seems a bit skewed, but I'm really satisfied with my purchase.

**Keyboard**: Alright so I think this is one of the biggest complaints I've seen discussed, but after about 10 hours of use I can say that I'm absolutely in love with it. I realize a lot of us are accustomed to certain features, but please don't assume the new keyboard is bad before you try it. Honestly I'm not sure I could go back to the older model keyboards.

**Trackpad**: One of the things I looked forward to most, and as I had imagined, it's fantastic. We all know that Apple produces one of, if not the best trackpad in laptops, not much more to say here.

**Performance**: I was a bit worried with the difference in performance in comparison to the 2015 15"" base model I had, but I will say that I'm by no means a graphic designer/editor so I'm not using performance heavy programs anyways. But as for regular tasks, I had absolutely no stutters/lags, not sure if this is even relevant but just figured I'd mention it. 

**Few other things to mention**: Battery life is superb so far, even with brightness at 100% (my brand new 15"" was only hitting 4-5 hours) and my 2016 13"" was still at around 38% after 6 hours while I was backing up through iCloud, doing some research, etc. 


So I know all of this has been gone over in other reviews and I'm not really going in depth here, but just wanted to let you all know my experience so far for those of you who are on the verge of making the purchase. I have absolutely no regerts.

**edit**: I suppose I should have added my ""cons"" list. It's really nothing different than what's been said. I personally don't mind the need for additional dongles, but I find it absurd that Apple doesn't include them. I loved MagSafe, but it's not a deal breaker.

apple,Thoughts on my New Macbook Pro: Windows Conversion,"Hi r/apple.

Picked up the new base model 13 in MacBook Pro. There's a lot of negativity going around this sub-reddit regarding the new products, so I wanted to throw my two cents in. I was planning on buying the 15 in with touch bar, but ended up buying the 13 in without touch bar, when I could not justify the price upgrade and the touch bar.

**Thoughts:***
*Oh my god. Space gray looks SO beautiful. This machine looks and feels GODLY. It's breath-taking to open this machine every day. Makes it feel worth every penny. Coming from a newer Dell, I love it. 

* Keyboard is kinda shallow, but I got used to it very, very quickly. No worries there.

* Don't need a touch bar for every day tasks. The speakers sound awesome.

* Battery life on this little machine is amazing. I ran it 1.75 days with a mix of stand-by and work without charging. 

* Screen is way brighter compared to the previous generation. Realized how I never use the ports on my computer...

If I'm making it sound like a million-bucks, that's because it is. Not a ""fan-boy"", but I'm really like this computer. It was pricey, but absolutely worth it.

apple,Scott Galloway: Spotify wins over Apple Music subscribers because of better personalisation algorithms.,"[Here is L2 Inc’s latest video that looks particularly at the future of retail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CztRvr7_5W8). 

The most important point Scott Galloway makes is that the businesses that are doing the best in retail right now are the ones that are able to fully utilise the data that they have on their customers in order to improve individual customer experience. So theoretically, Amazon’s personalised shop front and price changes are winning against Walmart due to the fact that Amazon responds per customer, whilst Walmart upsells what it believes may be popular overall.

Similarly, Spotify is doing a better job with music discovery than Apple Music, which explains the customer difference (though admittedly, that could also be explained by the head start that Spotify had on Apple in the streaming industry).

I personally tried Apple Music for the three month trial before moving to Spotify, mainly because the student discount was cheaper on Spotify at the time. 

Nevertheless, is Scott Galloway’s argument valid?

apple,"Hackers are trying to determine if your email address is associated with an iCloud account, and Apple makes it incredibly easy for them.","Over the past few days, I've had a couple of events take place that lead me to believe scammers/hackers/phishers are attempting to determine if email addresses (obtained from other data breaches) are associated with iCloud accounts. Thanks to one (easily fixable) issue with how Apple handles invitations within their ecosystem, they make it very easy for scammers to do. 

The first one was a calendar invitation my iCloud account had received. It was a recurring appointment, daily, in Chinese. I knew from past experience that if you decline an event on a Mac or iOS device, the sender receives a notification. There is no simple delete or ignore function. 

To get this event out of my calendar, I had to create a new iCloud calendar, move the event to it, then delete that calendar. When you do, a ""Delete and don't notify"" option presents itself- something that should not be this difficult. 

Now today, I have received a photo sharing invitation, also in Chinese, and once again, there is no simple delete or ignore function. I'm nervous to decline the invitation to remove it from my shared albums, because I'm sure the sender is going to get a notification from my email (iCloud) address. For now I'm stuck with it.

I implore everyone to enable two-factor authentication on their iCloud accounts, and don't respond to invites from people who aren't in your contacts, or that you're expecting an invitation from. Hopefully Apple will allow us in the future to ignore or delete unwanted event or sharing invitations without notifying the sender.

For that, it just costs way too much.""","http://www.macrumors.com/2012/10/23/hands-on-with-apples-new-13-inch-retina-macbook-pro/

&gt; Well, I'm sure I'll be attacked for this, but I'm gonna say it anyway:

&gt; Tiny harddrive, barely enough RAM (and not upgradable to the ""enough"" level), no dedicated graphics, only dual-core processors. It certainly isn't bad, but Apple just took the ""pro"" out of the 13"" line. And come on - it's freaking expensive. If you upgrade the SSD to 512gb and get an i7 (still dual-core - WTF?) processor, it's only 99$ cheaper than the mid-level 15"" rMBP, which packs a heck of a lot more power. What gives???

&gt; the 13"" is NOT a pro device in my opinion. It's more like a beefed-up and slightly heavier Macbook Air. For that, it just costs way too much.

Persecuted minority worried about Apple's new product, check. Apple's new product is overpriced, check. The new Pro isn't Pro enough and has bad specs, check.

Enough already. Look... Steve was the heart and soul of Apple for as long as he was on its payroll. We know that. But while there were a great many things that came out of Apple on his watch, there were plenty of blunders too. He was a human being who had his own vision of what Apple should be and how their products should work, and not all of his decisions were the rose-(gold-)tinted decisions to which we're constantly comparing the modern Apple.

Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs. Jobs was a vision guy and Cook is a numbers guy. There's a fundamental difference in how they operate, so the notion that Cook makes decisions that Steve wouldn't make is *already clear*. But Tim Cook was chosen by Steve because they worked together, and in that decision he obviously felt that Cook was the best choice out of anyone else to steer the company after he checked out - *for better or for worse.* So what would Steve do if he were still alive? He would appoint Tim Cook as his successor. And that's exactly what happened. Leave it at that. 

Very few of you ever met the guy, even less (if any) ever worked with him. The simple fact of the matter is, you have **absolutely no idea** what Steve Jobs would do. The executive team at Apple worked directly with Steve Jobs for many years, and every single one of them is *infinitely* more qualified than any of us to make a judgement call on what he would or wouldn't do. And even then, before he died Steve specifically told Tim, *""never ask what I would do.""*

apple,Shower thought: the new non-touchbar MacBook Pro is the Retina MacBook Air we've wanted for a long time,"For years, many people on this sub (myself included) have wanted a Retina MacBook Air--a powerful machine with a retina display and the form factor of the Air. Those hopes were dimmed when the ultraportable but low-powered 12"" MacBook came out. They are rekindled with the new lowest-tier MacBook Pro.

For comparison:

 | MacBook Air (2015) | MacBook Pro (2016)
---|---|---
Weight | 2.96 lbs | 3.02 lbs
Height | 0.68"" (at thickest point) | 0.59""
Resolution | 1440 x 900 | 1440 x 900 (Retina scaled)
Storage | 256 GB | 256 GB
RAM | 8 GB | 8 GB
Battery life | 12 hours | 10 hours
Geekbench | 6561 (with 2.2 GHz processor) | 6970
Price | $1349 (with 2.2 GHz processor) | $1499

USB-C mitigates the biggest disadvantage of the MacBook Air: the lack of ports. The MBA has two USB-A ports, one mini-DisplayPort, and one SDXC card reader. The new MBP only has two USB-C ports, but USB-C can provide power, connect multiple displays, and support USB devices *simultaneously*. With a dock, you can plug a single USB-C cable into your laptop and instantly convert it into a dual-monitor workstation with a mouse and keyboard.

You do have to pay an extra $150, and you get higher performance and a retina screen for your trouble. That may or may not be worth it to you, but to me, it's the sweet spot. I plan to buy one this month.

P.S. Try out the keyboard in store. It's shallow like the MacBook, but more tactile and enjoyable to use. I actually prefer it to the mushy 2015 MBP keyboards.",95,195,2016-11-08,AAPL,0.0354008711874485,0.9230608344078064,0.04153827205300331

apple,Apple needs to bail on Lightning for USB C [Opnion],"With the launch of the new MacBook Pros, it seems like Apple is putting its support behind USB C (while disguising it as Thunderbolt 3). The versatility of USB C is exciting because every port can do everything and we will no longer require unique ports that can only charge, transfer data or plug into an external display. For this reason I'm okay with the new MacBook Pro going full USB C. 


&amp;nbsp;

However in my eyes, the main barrier to achieving this simplified world of using the same cable to do everything is the existence of Lightning. We are currently in the midst of a connectivity fiasco within the Apple ecosystem after Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7.  Not being able to plug the iPhone 7 into a new MacBook Pro out of the box, and not being able to plug the headphones that you get with your iPhone 7 into a MacBook (or any other device), is extremely frustrating. 


&amp;nbsp;

Personally, losing the headphone jack in iPhone 7 didn’t really bother me, but I can’t help but feel that we would all benefit if Apple took a USB C only approach. I also think that losing the headphone jack would be an easier pill for some to swallow if they were at least gaining a universal port. Getting a new MacBook requires not only dongles for USB A/HDMI/SD to USB C, but also a Lightning to USB C cable if you want to plug an iOS device in. This cable serves literally only one purpose. If you don’t want to get wireless headphones for your iPhone 7, you are stuck with Apple’s EarPods, or forced to invest in wired Lightning headphones that can only plug into an iOS device.


&amp;nbsp;

Yes, Apple only introduced Lightning just over 4 years ago in 2012 with iPhone 5 and it probably was intended to be around for many more years (the 30 pin launched in 2003 and wasn’t fully killed off until 2014). And yes, they are making money off of licensing Lightning to accessory makers. But a) the current state of their products from a connector standpoint is a mess, and b) I highly doubt their revenue stream from licensing Lightning is so substantial that it would be a huge deal scrapping it. People would be upset and it would be annoying for anyone with existing Lightning accessories, but at least it would be moving to an open standard that is cross platform. 


&amp;nbsp;

Going all in on USB C would allow you to charge an iPhone, iPad and MacBook with the same charger. You could get wired headphones that plug into an iPhone, iPad or MacBook (or any other non Apple USB C device). One USB C to USB C cable could be used for your iPhone/iPad/MacBook charger, to plug your iPhone or iPad into your MacBook, or to transfer data to an external drive or plug into a display. We may need one more set of dongles to get there, but if Apple puts its heft behind USB C, we could literally get to the point where a single USB C to USB C cable could plug pretty much any device into any other device, regardless of manufacturer. 


&amp;nbsp;


Just my two cents. And maybe this is all pointless since everything will be wireless soon. Curious to hear other other peoples’ opinions.",220,342,2016-11-13,AAPL,0.06611217558383942,0.9069685339927673,0.026919277384877205

apple,"Day One with a 2016 15"" i7 2.9 | 460 4GB | 512GB MBP","First thought; isn't it time to drop the ""r"" from ""rMBP""?  Apple no longer brands these as ""retina MacBook Pro"" as they no longer sell a non-retina.  The stalwart 2012 non-retina has finally met it's bitter end.  (So long, sweet prince.  This world didn't deserve your easy upgradeability, and ability to install two SSD's...)

This, for me, was a big upgrade.  I'm moving on from a 2012 MacBook Pro (non-Retina).  13"", no less.

No benchmarks yet.  I was going to but, frankly; there's others already so no need.  I do want to do some gaming benchmarks* in Windows, but BootCamp is not cooperating with me.  

(*This is not a gaming machine, and nobody should buy it solely for gaming.  But nevertheless, it's a genuine interest of users like me who might like to do some portable gaming on rare occasion.  Just how capable is that Radeon Pro 460?)

So my initial, first-day thoughts:

- I actually really like the keyboard.  I didn't think I would.  I thought it would be tolerable; but a step down from the traditional Apple chiclet keyboard.  IMHO, it's nothing like the keyboard on the 12"" MacBook, and in fact; and I almost can't believe I'm saying this, I like it *better* than the chiclet keyboard on my 2012 MacBook Pro.  The trick seems to be getting used to a light touch.  Since I use a mechanical keyboard both at work and in my home office, it is a bit different.

- The touchbar is kind of useful, kind of not.  It still surprises me when I reach up and touch glass instead of an escape key.  So far; the most useful aspect: scrubbing.  That's the one thing the touchbar does *better* that previous non-touchbar MacBook Pro's didn't do as well.  Adjusting volume, brightness, etc., is now slower than before, and requires extra steps. Emoji's are neat in iMessage.  I guess.

- It's very snappy.  That insanely fast SSD is, well, insanely fast.  And the quad-core CPU is a welcome improvement over my previous model. 

- 16GB of RAM has gotten headlines, but looking through some of the most extreme workflows I could imagine on my 2012 model, I couldn't come very close to maxing it out.  So I suspect it'll be okay.  If you're at all unsure of whether or not 16GB will be a bottleneck; you may need to wait for 2018.  Kaby Lake also does not support more than 16GB of LPDDR3 and Apple is clearly going that direction.  So we'll need to wait for Cannonlake before we see 32GB of RAM available.

- Big huge trackpad is big huge trackpad.  Can't say I notice it being better or worse.  My palms rest on it when I'm typing; but that has yet to be an issue at all.  Very good palm rejection.

- USB-C charging is a bit annoying.  No LED light, if the volume is turned down you don't get the ""tone"" (which is the same as when you plug in an iPhone.  Tacky much?)  And I still feel robbed, not having magsafe.  But, oh well.

- Having the horsepower to drive two 4k displays in addition to the 2880x1800 internal display is pretty sweet.  I bought a pair of USB-C to DisplayPort cables to connect to my dell 4k displays.

- USB-C isn't the end of the world that people think it is.  You don't need dongles for everything; most things can just use a different cable.  Since USB-C can do everything; you can pretty much get a cable for anything.  USB-C on one end and just about any connector on the other end.  DisplayPort, USB B, mini, micro; Lightning, etc.  But, yes, in addition to the insane price of this new machine; you will need a fistful of dongles and new cables.  *This machine is not for the cost-concious*.  

- On that point, the 2016 MacBook Pro might have the most significant ""Apple early adopter Tax"" that we've seen in a long time.  In my opinion, 2018's Cannonlake upgrade will offer more RAM, and a real performance boost.  And probably a price drop as well.  That's in line with the last couple of 'generations'.  The second refresh is where they become more affordable.

- ""But it's not as powerful as X windows laptop which is half as much"".  Yep.  Moving on...

- It's impossibly thin and light.  The pics don't do it justice.  This thing really is an ultraportable.  And on that note; maybe the issue of performance is an issue that we're actually going backwards.  In the early days of notebooks they were anemic, super-low powered machines that were designed to be on the go; but any real work is done on a desktop.  Now that our iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks can do any basic computing task we could possibly want to; the remaining bastion of high performance computing is content creation.  So I think Apple sees that; and is focusing on the MacBook Pro as an Ultraportable first, and then cramming as much horsepower as they can without compromising on it being an ultraportable.  I think they've done that.  It is not a portable Mac Pro.  It's not even a portable iMac.  But it is, in my opinion, the very best Ultraportable on the market.  With the power of much bigger laptops; and a fantastic screen.

In summary: It's what it is, and it isn't what it isn't; and it isn't ashamed of either.  All of the criticisms are right, there's no use trying to defend it.  It is underpowered compared to the very most powerful Windows gaming and workstation laptops.  The touchbar is not a must-have feature.  USB-C is going to require new dongles and cables, and it is super expensive.  But it's also the best in it's class.  The problem I think people are going to find; is that Apple is beginning to change what ""class"" it's competing in.

IMHO; I'd like to see Apple continue this direction, and release a 4k display equipped 17"" MacBook Pro complete with DDR4 RAM (not ""LP"" which is limited), allowing for 32GB+, maybe even mobile Xeon CPU's, and faster (nVidia?) GPU's.  That could be the perfect content creation portable; designed to go from one desk to another, but still capable of being a genuinely portable machine (off-desk) in a pinch.  A bridge between an iMac/Mac Pro and the ultraportable MacBook Pro's.

If anyone has questions, feel free to ask.  I'm stepping out for a bit, but will certainly come back to answer them.  Just thought I'd share my 'thoughts' on the first day of using it.

iphone,Apple just announced it will fix iPhones with Touch Disease for $149,"I can't believe this. I actually experienced this problem a year ago and even posted a question about it on /r/iphonehelp ([iPhone 6+ w/iOS9 odd behavior with touch](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphonehelp/comments/3sjj1t/iphone_6_wios9_odd_behavior_with_touch/)). Since the original issue, I took it into a store and after one of their diagnostics, they said there was nothing wrong with it. 

Naturally, I walked out looking like a fool, but on January 1st or 2nd of this year, the same problem happened again. I made *another* trip to the Apple store (luckily I'm in Chicago with multiple options) and was able to reproduce the issue for a tech to see. He took it to the back and replaced it **for free** because it was the second time I brought in my phone and despite being out of warranty (no Apple Care either!)  he said the first time I brought it in I was within my warranty period and as a goodwill gesture, they'll replace for free. (whoo hoo)

I've seen a few threads pop-up over the last year about this same issue. Today, I come across this:

apple,A programmer's thoughts on the MBPT keyboard,"I am a new owner of the 15"" Macbook Pro with Touchbar.

I've read so many reviews on the keyboard, that I thought I'd chime in with my real-world experience.

In short, I prefer it.

Right now, I have 4 keyboards in my area.  A Macbook Air('s keyboard), a Apple bluetooth keyboard, a wireless logictech one, and of course, this very keyboard.  My favorite keyboard is this one.

* It's very clicky
* I don't notice the ""lack"" of travel, at least compared to the other Apple keyboards
* It's low-resistance, compared to the Air's keyboard.
* The ""esc"" key is compatible with my existing typing habits, so things like ""vi"" are not special cases.  It's be nice if it clicked.

The full-height arrow keys have been the hardest to get used to for some reason.  I feel the left arrow key, and my brain tells me it's probably the Option key and i have to go look at it.

The touchbar is clever as hell.  I am anxious for Atom and Chrome to gain support, but in Apple Mail, it's handier than you'd expect.  For touch typists, yeah, you have to look, but once you learn (or customize) an app's touchbar, it's just fine.",125,290,2016-11-18,AAPL,0.026154326274991035,0.9332245588302612,0.04062113165855408
apple,The Touch Bar's missing killer feature + impressions,"I'm a Product Designer &amp; iOS engineer and have been using the new Touch Bar for a couple days. Verdict? It's...just alright--I know it's early days so I'm interested to see where devs/Apple take it.

&amp;nbsp;

The Touch Bar definitely has some ""reconfiguring the brain"" issues (how often do you look at your keyboard? Yeah me neither) but there are some semi-useful things here and there (photos shortcuts are neat, emoji bar is cool). 

&amp;nbsp;

It's honestly really hard to get used to looking down at your keyboard--I constantly forget the bar is even there.

&amp;nbsp;

I really wish there was haptic feedback when you tap a button. It just feels so not-satisfying when I touch something because you go from typing on a physical keyboard to tapping a software button. 

I over/undershoot the escape key 4/5 times when attempting (apparently i use it all the time while designing). It pains my soul. I'm sure I'll get used to it and up my accuracy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Having music forward/backward, up/down volume, brightness (and other previously one tap things) two taps away is a bit of a headache as well (the control strip has to expand before you can use those things).

In general most of the current touch bar supported apps are not very well thought out--both Apple and third party.

One small example, the tab thumbnails when using Safari are silly and hard to make out--just show me the page title. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What's missing? Honestly I am completely baffled this isn't a feature. I REALLY want an option to either:**

&amp;nbsp;

**1) Have a button in the control strip (where the volume/brighteness/etc controls are) that expands and shows my dock on the touch bar.**

&amp;nbsp;

**2) Or have an option to have my dock be persistent on the touch bar always.**

&amp;nbsp;

**For both options the dock wouldn't display on my desktop anymore.**

&amp;nbsp;

It would be glorious. Fullscreen goodness. App switching would be a dream.

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR: Apple, let me have my dock on the Touch Bar and I'd consider the thing a must have.**

apple,I created a Touch Bar app for fast app switching,"I [recently posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5dlc3n/the_touch_bars_missing_killer_feature_impressions/) about my desire to have an option on the Touch Bar to see my dock (either a button on the control strip that displays my dock on tap or some setting to keep the touch bar dock open when the occasion calls for it). 

&amp;nbsp;

The reasoning being 1. The dock takes up precious space on my screen (I don't use/like the hide/show dock feature) and 2. It seems like a great idea for fast app switching instead of command tab, mission control, launchpad, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Especially made sense for my line of work (Product Design &amp; iOS development) because while working I am constantly switching (via a mix of vigorous Mission Control use, space swiping and Command+Tab) between Sketch, Xcode, Safari, Slack, Terminal, Spotify, Notes, Airmail, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**Last night I tooled around for a couple hours creating a MacOS app with TouchBar support and was able to put a working prototype together.  Looks like this: http://imgur.com/gallery/8lKYd**

&amp;nbsp;

**I moved away from the display the whole dock idea and only show the currently running apps on the Touch Bar (made more sense for my use case to be contextual about apps to display to better assist workflow productivity rather than display everything)--on tap it brings that particular app to the foreground. Makes it really easy to quickly swap between an exact task with one tap.**

&amp;nbsp;

There are some drawbacks at present--mostly being that you can't put custom apps/buttons in the control strip (Apple doesn't allow third party functions in control strip). Also the Touch Bar app options disappear once you bring another app to the foreground (only the active app's Touch Bar actions show). I've briefly looked into overriding these things with Private APIs but haven't done anything yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, thought it was interesting and wanted to share.

apple,"Picked up a tbMBP 15"" today - Impressions on moving from the 2012 13"" Non-Retina MBP.","I originally had a preorder placed that was scheduled to be delivered in December, but luckily enough, I was able to pick one similarly spec'ed MBP 15"" from the Apple Store in Soho, Manhattan. The following are my impression coming from a non-retina 2012 13"" MBP, and being both a Windows, Mac, iPhone and Android user. 

The Specs of my machine are:

* 2.9 GHz i7
* 16 GB RAM
* AMD Radeon Pro 460 (4GB GGDR5)
* Intel HD 530 iGPU
* 1 TB SSD
* Touchbar and TouchID

**Design:**

So there's obviously been a big gap in my MacBook Pro experience, because I have upgraded from a fairly old machine. So first things first, I know many people have said that this thing feels amazing; but trust me when I say this that words cannot do justice to how well built and premium this device feels in your hand. It feels more premium and rock solid than any other MBP Apple has made imo. It's amazingly thin and light, thinner and lighter than my old MBP, granted it was an older device. I picked up the silver color, because (one) they didn't have the space gray in stock, and (two) I've heard that the space gray starches to reveal shiny silver underneath. But either ways, color doesn't matter to me much. I have the space gray iPhone 6S and the space gray Apple Watch series 2, and both of them don't even match in shade. So there was no reason for me to wait for space gray, in hopes that I would have all my Apple devices in the same matching color. My roommate has a 2015 15"" MBP and even compared to that, this machine is thinner, lighter and better feeling. All in all, this machine feels really *really* great. 

*EDIT:* [Comparison Shots](http://imgur.com/a/i52sE)

**Performance:**

Well this was one of the biggest things for me, granted I'm moving from an older machine, yet still this machine feels much faster and snappier than my old MBP and my roommate's 2015 maxed out 15"" MBP. So far, this thing has handled anything I've thrown at it. It transfer 15GB  (university documents, big photoshop and illustrator files) from my old USB 3.0 hard drive in flat 1 min. Working with big illustrator files was buttery smooth, not a single stutter. Installing bootcamp was also a breeze, it took the laptop only 15 minutes to install to do the whole bootcamp installing process (excluding driver download time; university wifi is terrible). I also ran some games on this thing, they are as follows:

* Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Native resolution (1440p), Max everything, avg FPS of 93-95, ran on MacOS
* Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Native Resolution (1440p), Max Everything, avg FPS 60-62, ran on Windows 10 via Bootcamp
* Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, 1080p, High, avg FPS 53-55, ran on Windows 10 via Bootcamp
* Battlefield 1, 1080p, Medium, avg FPS 50-53, ran on Windows 10 via Bootcamp
* Battlefield 1, 1080p, High, avg FPS 33-35, ran on Windows 10 via Bootcamp
* Dishonored, Native Resolution (1440p), Max Everything, avg 120-122 FPS, ran on Windows 10 via Bootcamp
* Bioshock Infinite GOTY, Native Resolution (1440p), Max Everything, avg 30-33, ran on Windows 10 via Bootcamp
* Batman Arkham City, Native Resolution (1440p), Max Everything, avg 45-50, ran on MacOS

*EDIT:* Wifi keeps dropping on Windows 10 in BootCamp, separate post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5dtnzv/wifi_keeps_dropping_in_windows_10_bootcamp_on_new/)

**Keyboard &amp; Trackpad:**

Like many people, I think is keyboard feels great. But, naturally I really need to get used to feeling the low travel, I've only had a mere day with this keyboard. It feel like I can type faster on this and while I feel like I make more mistakes on this keyboard, there's also the fact that I'm still getting used to a keyboard at this scale, my palms resting on a larger area and other factors. The keys are also a lot more sensitive. I'll update this section after a few more weeks with typing not this. Now for the trackpad, it feels great like any other Mac, but I feel like this trackpad is unnecessarily huge, like really. Throughout my time with the trackpad, I kept noticing that my finger would automatically restrict itself to the size of the trackpad on my older MBP. I honestly don't think I'll ever be using the extra space on the new trackpad. While, I've not had any issues with palm rejection, there is the problem with the 3 finger drag. The three finger drag works on a 60-40 ratio. I'll work 60% of the time, but 40% of time, the cursor won't even move when trying to use the gesture. Apparently this is a wide spread issue with all 15"" MBP and feel like more on the software side than the hardware so I'm hoping Apple releases a patch soon that'll fix this issue. Other than that, I feel like all it's going to take to get used to this new keyboard and trackpad is time and I don't see a scenario where I regret my purchase because of either of the two. 

**EDIT:** Serious palm rejection issues on Windows 10 via BootCamp. 

**Display:**

It's a major upgrade for me, moving from non-retina to retina. But when I compared the older 15in and the newer model in store side by side, you could really tell which one was the new one. One weird thing I've noticed is that I can't seem to find the right brightness for my eyes, the max brightness of the display is too bright and anything lower feels too dark. But this can just be me and my eyes playing tricks on me. I'll give myself some time to adjust to the new display overall and see if things improve in terms of finding the right brightness. But other than that, this display is a true delight. 

**Battery:** 

This one's kind of a tricky one. For some reason, I feel like the battery drains really fast. It maybe because it's a new battery and it's just needs a few charge cycles to get better, but I honestly won't know until after a few days. I read a post on this subreddit that said resetting the SMC fixes this, but before trying that, I'll give the battery a few charge cycles before making a final judgement. On the charge that the laptop came with, I was only able to put 2.5-3 hours of work, though, I was constantly transferring files, downloading my apps, and making all sorts of setting changes. I'll add more to this section after a little more time with this machine.

**#DongleLife:**

Not gonna lie, it does feel a little annoying. I have to use a dongle to connect to my gaming mouse, something that I didn't needed to do before. Even though I was fully expecting this, a little part of me died inside when I had to use the dongle. Something that I feel like makes this worse is that the ports and the apple dongle are really tight. Pulling out the wires are especially hard, feels like you trying to put apart a stack of paper, until it pops out that is. I would've appreciated a smoother connection. Pushing in the wires, or into the port is fine, pulling them out is the real issue. I don't know if it'll loosen up over continued use. Something I also now feel is a general hate of wires. Suddenly, I don't want anything to be connected by wires. I'm afraid it's probably because of the dongles and that I'm eventually going to go out and trying and replace any wired products with their wireless replacements. 

**Touchbar and TouchID:**

Let me just get the touchID out of the way. It's wonderful, it's super fast and works just like it works on the iPhone. Nothing in the world can convince me that the touchID is a bad addition to the laptop. It's plain convenient and I'm hoping more things will start accepting touchID as a password replacement. I'd honestly love to login into my email, Facebook, youtube and other accounts with touchID. I haven't used Apple Pay yet but I figure it's the same as on the iPhone. Now for the touchbar: It feels... different. It feels exactly like a iPhone screen (does not feel matte) and the visibility is great from almost any angle when facing the display directly. I don't see myself really using it for a lot of stuff and I feel like I have to reach out of the way for something. An exception to this is the brightness and volume sliders. It feels better, faster and easier to just touch and slide to adjust either of the two. Typing predictions are honestly useless and I'm never going to use them, typing is much faster. Emojis is good addition, and I'd honestly want to see more uses of it around the OS. I used pages and numbers and for some reason, the touchbar actually feels like good addition there. Formatting on Pages actually feels quicker with the touchbar. On safari, looking at the preview of the tabs is since, but for some reason they don't preview or show pinned tabs. I have Facebook, my email and Youtube always pinned and would like to use the touchbar for accessing them quickly as well. Scrubbing an online video is a welcome addition, an honest godsend because now I don't have to bother moving the mouse, dealing with the web player interface and having to click a bunch of places to get the keyboard shortcuts to work. I'm excited for the adobe updates though, I can't wait to use the touchbar with photoshop and illustrator.

**Speakers:**

It's an colossal improvement from my old Mac, and even a large improvement compared to the speakers on my roommate's MBP. I can't explain in words how good the speakers are for a laptop. I would say they can almost compete with my JBL FLip 3s, if it had more bass. Other than that, nothing much to report on. 

**Others:**

I will miss the glowing apple logo, magsafe, the battery indicator and even the standby led. Those were some of Apple's unique inventions and they should've crammed it into the laptop one way or another. Since I also have a Apple Watch and a iPhone, the whole Apple experience and everything just working together is great. It's actually one of the greater reasons why I think I'll never be able to go back to Windows.

Let me know if you guys have any question, I'll love to and will try to reply to all of them. 

**Overall opinion:** I feel like owning this new laptop is like having a little child (though I know nothing about parenting). The laptop makes all kinds of things a fuzz, but it's yours, you love it and appreciate it, and eventually grow with it. It's better in many ways, and it kind of feels like it's preparing you for the future.

apple,iCloud Drive is just laughable,"I like Apple for quite a while now and owned some iPhones before but always dreamed about owning a MacBook. Now that Apple finally refreshed their entire line up I also pulled the trigger and ordered myself a nearly spec’d out MacBook Pro 15"" inch earlier this month (which still hasn´t been shipped yet…). 
Since then I literally absorbed every news, YouTube video, tweet, Reddit post that was out there about the new MacBook’s and started to worry a bit about my purchase. I just want to love this machine so much but damn there are some quirks I can´t easily overlook. Personally, I actually adore Apples wireless vision of the future and could get over the somewhat limited port situation if they would provide a proper cloud.
As I gave Apples iCloud Drive a shot again on the MacBook of a friend I suddenly got reminded again just how far Apple is behind its competitors. 


I put up a short, unordered list with my main complains about Apples Cloud solution: 


* It´s not possible to share folders/ files via link with other persons
* The iOS app/ web app treats images as isolated files (no preview/ cycling trough a folder full of images)
* No version control
* No online PDF viewer
* No way to upload whole folders via the website
* No way to download a whole folder (like srsly wtf apple?!)


Don´t get me wrong here I’m not hating against the whole iCloud, I’m just talking about iCloud Drive which feels to me just like an ftp server with a nicer UI…


Sorry about my little rant here but I guess I had to release some anger by writing this. Also, I’m curious to know what you guys think about Apples Cloud Service? Do you agree with me or am I missing something?

apple,How to Understand Tim Cook's Apple,"**BEFORE**

Apple used their competitive advantage—industrial design &amp; software/hardware integration—to create the technological products around you, from desktops to laptops and monitors and printers and so on. Basically everything at your desk. This was their focus, and it was a breath of fresh air from the (generally) poorly designed, or overly complicated alternatives. 


**WHAT HAPPENED**

Apple had a brilliant idea to integrate a music retail service (iTunes Store) with a music device (iPod). This became a huge hit, and on many levels influenced the Apple of today. What happened was Apple realized they could hit a bunch of birds with one stone:

* Create an easy to use device (eg. iPod). The easier to use, the better, because then more people can use it (less learning curve, and cognitive taxation).
* Sell in high numbers x high profit-margin ($$$)
* By integrating the service (eg. iTunes Store) you make the product not just competitive to other alternatives, but resilient because of lock-in (once you buy music via iTunes, the DRM locked you into iPod)
* You make residual money on service-integrated devices (Apple makes money off your iPod past the initial sale because you're now buying music from iTunes, which they get a % of)

In other words, they sell you the device (iPod) and continue to make money for the life of the device because you're buying stuff (iTunes music). It was a brilliant plan... executed beautifully.

**NOW**

Jobs is gone and Cook is the head executive. They've had hit after hit with the iPhone and it's responsible for the majority of their financial growth. What this has to do with the past is that Apple and Cook see and know that the phone is a service-integrated device: once they sell you the phone, it doesn't end there; they can extract more money from Apple Pay, Apple Music, iTunes Store, iCloud, App Store (from all those apps you download) and of course accessories. Apple Pay is a big one because Apple makes a percentage of that Credit Card fee, getting a payback from banks (this is why you now also have Apple Pay on macOS and Touch ID on your MacBook Pro).

In other words, iPhone makes Apple a mega-shit ton of money up front, and then a mega-shit ton of money in residual revenue because of integrated-services—hence why they are now an integrated-services company.

**CONCLUSION**

This explains why Apple is cutting the monitor business, and the Router business, and lacking focus on Mac Pros and so on. I'm sure they see the intelligence in keeping a sub-set of the pro market happy, but time and staff is money, and they don't want to waste any of it making people *just* happy if it doesn't align with the new business model, because it's taking focus away from becoming the ultimate services-integrated company.

**REGARDING iPad &amp; the new MacBook Pros**

Apple sees the future as people walking around, being productive, using services. This is fulfilled by iPhone and iPad. This is their future. This is their next 10, 20, 30 years. It seems the iPad and MacBook Pros will converge over the next 5 years or so. Most likely, when Apple's ARM chips are ready, the iPad will become the new MacBook line. Apple has a rule: 90/90. What 90% of the people want to do 90% of the time, Apple wants to fulfill. When things get into that 10% margin, Apple will cut it. Since iPad can handle about 60-80% of what people want to do with computers, it's just a matter of getting to that 90% with the chips, and with the form factor (because it's not quite there yet).


**PLEASE**

This isn't a value judgement. I just want to help people understand what changes are happening at Apple.

apple,2016 Macbook Pro Configuration and Battery Results - [OC],"# Hello everyone!

Recently, I posted here a link to a simple survey where users could report which specific 2016 Macbook Pro they owned and how many hours of battery life they get a day. I wanted to keep the survey pretty basic so I apologize to those who didn't appreciate the limited options.

As the months go by, a more detailed and accurate survey could be out but this is just an initial, right out the bat survey just to get a typical feel from the user.

Note, this survey was more intended to see the spread of specific configurations. For instance, which SSD configuration was the most popular or which Graphics card was the least. Battery was included as just an extra measure. 

So, let's begin shall we?

I hope you enjoy this huge presentation post put together. As I had mentioned, there might be another, more detailed and specific survey relating to battery but for now this is suitable.

Glad you can now see which configuration is the most popular and the average battery results reported from users + some typed responses.

mac,Apple gave me a new laptop,"Hello /r/mac 

Today I went to my local Apple store to pick up my 2011 MBP from repair. I had to have the logic board replaced because of the video card issues that are well documented with those computers, and this is the second time that I have had to have this done. 

I go in and get my computer, and all is well. I leave the store and go sit down to turn on the computer. When I boot it up, all is good. After I put in my password, I was met with the screen distortion that indicated a video card issue. After seeing this, I headed back to the Apple store.

I go back in, and they take care of me right away. They start a test to see if it is indeed the same part they just replace. The genius bar employee then goes to the back while the test is running, and comes back out while it is still doing the test. He then tells me that since it has had 2 major repairs under warranty, and because they cannot fix the problem in-house, that they will be giving me a new computer.

He was going to give me one of the 2016 MBP, the ones with all usb-c ports, but they did not have any in stock. Instead, they gave me a 2015 rMBP. 

So over the past week+, I went from thinking I was going to have to buy a new laptop because it was out of warranty, to learning that they extended their ""extended logic board warranty program"" to the end of this year, to getting a brand new computer. It's been quite a ride.",65,215,2016-11-24,AAPL,0.047596275806427,0.8750981092453003,0.07730568200349808

apple,Disabled brother unable to dial 9-1-1 on iPhone 6 due to touch disease,"For the past year my disabled brother has been battling with Apple to get his iPhone 6 fixed as it has the common touch disease. Two weeks ago he was in an emergency situation and unable to contact 9-11 as the screen was once again unresponsive. This was a big wake up call to get serious about getting this fixed for him. Luckily someone found him on the sidewalk and was able to call for help on their phone. He saved up his own money (he makes art and sells it at the local community center) to buy this $1000 (CDN) iPhone 6 last year. A month into owning it the problems started and he went to Apple and they replaced it with one that came with a 3 month warranty vs year without explaining this to him. Earlier this year when the phone was still under warranty it was showing signs of the problem. He went back into Apple and was told they cannot exchange it because they already did and new hardware did not fix the problem and this was ""probably a software issue"" and suggested to wait for an update. The fix never came and my family has been fighting with Apple ever since. I just got off the phone with someone in Apples customer relations who told me she has never heard of this problem and that her and her husbands iPhone 6 work perfectly. I pointed out that several other people online have reported the same issue and she said that it was only the 6 plus that had problems. After going back and forth with her she told me this model has been out for 2 years and if there was a real problem Apple would have fixed it by now. I had a genius at my local Apple store tell me off the record that he sees this problem a lot. He also told me that even if I were to get Apple to agree to wave the cost of the out of warranty replacement that the replacement would still be an iPhone 6 and that the problem would ""likely"" come up again. He suggested to just buy a 6s as they are much more reliable. I don't think it is fair to have to shell out another $1000 for a phone that is expected to last longer than a year. I'm so turned off by Apple now and if I could would get my brother into an Android device but many of his apps are iOS only and was a huge learning curve to get him used to the iphone in the first place. His phone is his life, he feels safe going out to the park on his own as long as he has it, it gives him freedom and less disabled if that makes any sense.",109,176,2016-11-25,AAPL,0.1558849811553955,0.8028755187988281,0.041239529848098755

I told him it's fine and he doesn't have to, but he insisted on getting it for me. After a while, he wouldn't back down so I took his offer and took it as a blessing.

apple,"Nostalgic for the ""old Apple"", with multicoloured Nanos, cool adverts, diverse product lines and general hype about everything on their website","I'm not old enough to remember the OLD Apple where they were crashing and burning, but I grew up around the iPod nano era, I specifically remember the Nano Chromatic advert with the dripping paint (and deciding I wanted the blue one for Christmas, which I was lucky enough to get) and I miss that feeling.

The new adverts and branding is all very... same old. The old adverts, even the iPhone 5 advert titled Cheese with the white space and the panorama demo was fun, the current ads are much more busy and 'Hollywood' I think. I do enjoy the new ads though! Just the old ones give me some sense of serious nostalgia. Even the iPod touch 5G one with the iPods bouncing around with the hand grab at the end is more memorable than any of the current Watch ads (for example).

Even the website feels like somewhere I go just to see how expensive everything is now, rather than to see and awe at the new products. Everything just feels very different to how it did a few years ago I suppose.

Does anyone else have any nostalgia for any Apple ads, or certain products? Thought this might be an interesting discussion topic!",98,186,2016-11-26,AAPL,0.02462838403880596,0.9304836392402649,0.04488793760538101

apple,A month ago my Google Nexus 6 died. I decided to buy an iPhone..,".. And it was the best decision ever.

About a year ago, my friend asked me if i wanted to buy his old Macbook Pro (End 2009), and for 400 euro's I decided why not. I was always sceptical about the Macbooks because they were really expensive and their specs didn't seem that amazing, but since I needed a new laptop for school, i decided to buy his secondhand Macbook.

I fell in love with that Macbook. It out-performed some of my classmates (new) Dell  laptops. Fast forward 6 months, and I bought a new Macbook Pro Retina. I use this Macbook Pro everyday and it's the best laptop I have ever used.

I was using Android for about 7 years prior to buying the iPhone. I was always really happy with the way I could customise my Android to add extra functionality stock Android didn't have. However Android had come a far way, and all the functionality wher efor i would tweak was now baked into stock Android. There was no reason anymore to ""root"" the device for me.

My Nexus 6 died because  I dropped it. I thought: ""I was always sceptical about Macbooks because of their price, until i bought one, and now i don't want to have anything else. Maybe that's the case with the iPhone a swell?"". Then i figured to do the same thing as with the Macbook, get a second hand one. About a month ago i bought a secondhand iPhone 6 Plus, to test how iOS and the iPhone will fit me.

And after a month I can say, iOS is perfect. It does everything so well. Some Android users will argue that there is not much to customise, but why would you? How many times do you really change your home screen?  Everything works, always. I haven't had any hiccups or anything like that, even though this phone is two years old. It's still blowing my mind.
The connection between my Macbook and my iPhone is awesome as well. Handoff made my leave a lot better by being able to edit one document on my iPhone, and on my Macbook.
Next week i'll probably order an iPhone 7 Plus. I love my 6 Plus, but I want to see the difference between the 7 Plus and 6 Plus as well.

I just had to share this, sorry for the long post :)

apple,Apple Phone Support is incredible!,"Just posting a note that Apple Phone Support is unbelievably great.

For about two weeks, I've been having a very specific issue with iMessage on a MacBook Pro: messages have been coming through, but trying to send anything to anyone results in an immediate ""Not Delivered"" response. My other Apple devices can all send and receive fine through the same account. And my MacBook Pro is running great in every other respect - network access, and even iCloud, are generally performing fine.

I tried the usual things, including logging out of iCloud and in again. Nothing resolved it.

This is very familiar territory. I've spent 30 years working to resolve these kinds of anomalous issues with Microsoft OSes. And I'm used to settling for the standard IT options:

1) Keep digging through help articles for increasingly improbable solutions.

2) Post a question on MSDN, and get back some generally useless suggestions. (""Try rebooting your machine, and try uninstalling and reinstalling Microsoft Office, and then try scanning your hard disk for errors..."")

3) Run a diagnostic tool, and get the standard ""Windows was unable to diagnose the problem"" message that occurs in literally 100% of cases.

4) Reinstall the OS.

5) Give up.

With Apple, you have many of those same options - but also:

6) Call Apple Support.

Now, this is a late-2011 MBP, for which AppleCare+ expired around the time of Obama's reelection (though I would've renewed it if possible!) Plus, I initiated my call at 4:00pm EST on a Sunday following Thanksgiving. So I called fully expecting one of three things:

* ""Your device is out of warranty. Apple offers premium phone support for $89 per incident...""

* ""Your issue is beyond the capabilities of our phone support team. Please schedule an appointment with the Genius Bar at your local Apple Store...""

* ""Apple Support is available from 8am to 6pm EST Monday through Friday. Please call back during our normal business hours.""

I didn't get any of those.

Instead, I found myself talking to a highly skilled tech with lots of experience resolving iCloud issues. We tried a lot of steps to solve or at least diagnose the problem - none of which worked, but all of which made perfect sense in the context of solving this particular problem.

At the end of an hour, my tech was out of ideas. We could tell that my MBP has some kind of disconnect between the System Preferences iCloud pane (which reported being completely logged into iCloud) and iMessage (which reported an issue logging into iCloud, and sent me to the System Preferences pane to resolve it).

Again, most companies would have just given up at this point, and defaulted to advising me about recovery issues. Once again, that didn't happen.

Instead, I was transferred to a senior technician, who also tried diagnosing the problem on Apple's side, watching the activity that iCloud reported, and trying to connected via Back To My Mac so the tech could see what was happening. *Another* hour spent on the phone, still more diagnosis... still no resolution.

Apple, once again, didn't just punt. The senior tech emailed me a link to an OS-level data recorder, and I used it to record a complete dump from MacOS while reproducing the problem from various angles. Then I used a link from Apple to upload the entire data dump - 2.9 *gigabytes* of diagnostic data - and the senior tech said that he'd forward it to Apple engineers for further diagnosis.

In total, I spent nearly *three hours* on the phone with skilled Apple technicians, working through a very complex and frustrating iCloud / iMessage problem... for a five-year-old machine, three years out of warranty. And Apple isn't done yet. All for $0 in support costs.

In all the years I've dealt with technology of all kinds, I've never received such dedicated support above the company's legal requirements. It's almost as if... as if Apple *wants* its products to succeed, and *wants* its customers to be satisfied - even to the extent of paying to allocate very skilled support reps with no profit motive or ticket quotas.

This is why Apple has brand loyalty. This is why old-timers gladly pay the ""Apple Tax"" premium for new devices. This is why every version of MacOS runs *better* on old hardware - rather than adding layer upon layer of new, half-broken APIs atop legacy half-broken APIs.

Microsoft is generally doing better these days, and the lackluster MBP keynote vs. the Surface Pro Studio stuff showed that it's catching up. But experiences like I had tonight show that some sectors of Apple are still *light-years* ahead of Microsoft, as well as every other tech company.

Throughout the tech industry, Apple Support really is the gold standard.

Especially with the bigger screen, it just feels really natural. 

I feel like the iPad is just crying out to be 3D Touch compatible, and with the larger screen, it would open up possibilities for multi-input 3D Touch gestures which I can't even begin to imagine what that would be used for...*

Come on Apple, include it in the next iPad and you have my money. 

*it would be awesome if a five finger 3D press zoomed you out of an app and gave you some sort of 'command centre' overview of all your open apps, widgets etc. Apple really needs to build functionality like this into future iPads so they're not just blown-up iPhones.
