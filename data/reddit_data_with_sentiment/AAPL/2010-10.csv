apple,"Shit like this, Steve.","June of last year, my mother decided that she was sick of towers and wanted ""one of those all-in-one computers,"" an iMac. Fast forward to early this September, a couple days over two months past warranty. The top half of the backlight goes out. I go with her to take it to the Apple store, dreading the repair price.

Instead, since it was a fairly serious issue and the warranty expired only two months ago, they authorized the $800+ repair for free.

Fast forward two weeks. The repair is going horribly. They not only couldn't get the issue fixed, they actually broke a few other things in the process. God dammit, Apple.

Fast forward one more week, Apple calls us up and tells her she can come in and just exchange it. She says ok, and they do a data transfer. We go in the next day and they start ringing everything up. I noticed they matched the original price, not the original product.

My mom's 24"" iMac goes out 2 months after warranty and they give her a 27"" for free. The new machine is bigger in every respect: screen size, hard drive capacity, video card capacity, processor speed.

Just thought I'd share.

apple,"thanks for the free Macbook battery, Apple","My boyfriend and I just came back from the Apple store with a new battery for my three-year-old Macbook.  My old one was suffering from the bulging problem (lump in the center, along the length) and I figured I'd maybe get a student discount on a replacement, but that's it.  The recall program for those batteries stopped last year, so that wasn't going to help.  The Genius looked at my battery, looked up something on her computer for a bit, and had to answer a question for another store clerk.  I just sat patiently, chatting with my boyfriend and figuring I'd leave the store with my same old bulgy battery.

She told me I could spend $99 for my old battery to be sent off and I'd get a new battery, or $129 if I wanted to buy a new battery and keep my old one.  I explained how I'd probably just wait to get a new laptop in a few years, if the battery was going to cost much, and I was really only there because I worried the bulge was a safety concern (like it might explode or something).

Well, she went off and came back with a box, then proceeded to take out a new battery and replace my bulgy one in my Macbook.  I thought at this point she was testing something out, or maybe going to get pushy about me replacing the battery, but no, she told me she was going to give it to me.  I thanked her profusely and asked why.  She said me and my boyfriend seemed like nice people (we certainly hadn't been pushy or grouchy, and were patient while we waited), the bulgy battery was a weird problem, and she agreed with me wanting to wait and just get a whole new laptop in a few years rather than buy a battery for my old laptop now.

So, I'm typing this on my Macbook with its new, flat battery--hooray!  Just wanted to share my positive Apple experience.  :)  Next time I go to buy a computer, Apple'll definitely be first in my mind, which I'm sure is part of the goal with giving store employees the autonomy they have to give away products.",13,20,2010-10-02,AAPL,0.05138511583209038,0.9088401198387146,0.03977480158209801

apple,"So I got the new Apple TV... And unless I'm mistaken, it sucks complete ass.","I'm one of the few people who has an 'original' AppleTV and uses it semi-regularly. Despite its you-can-cook-an-egg-on-it heat and the sluggishness of the UI I find it useful for what it is. I'm already a Mac user so I buy a fair number of movies off of ITMS, it streams anything in Apple TV-compatible format in iTunes (not just ITMS content) and will play shared movies and videos from roommates' iTunes even though they both use Windows.

When the new Apple TV was announced I was thinking: Great! The hard drive was always a little superfluous anyway given we streamed most of our content from iTunes, it desperately needed a processor upgrade for at least the UI responsiveness, and sticking with 720p was/is fine with me, I guess (we have a 1080p TV but if I want crazy-high-res I'm happy to buy on BluRay So I'd say it wasn't a dealbreaker).

So then I actually *get* the new Apple TV yesterday, hooked it up, started flipping through the UI, and immediately some WTF alerts have started going off.

First off, the only way I can find to stream content is through Home Sharing. Unless I'm mistaken, you can't play content from 'regular' shared iTunes libraries anymore. In fact, despite there being a category 'Computers' (plural), as far as I can tell only a single computer can be shared - Selecting a home shared computer gives you one option, disconnect, and selecting ""Computers"" under setup gives you one option: Turn off Home Sharing. That's it.

Second, all my content is now relegated to the 'Computers' sub-menu. For example, on the old Apple TV, Movies had for Top Movies, HD Movies, and My Movies. Now both the TV and Movie categories *only* show ITMS streamable content. To get to my movies, for example, I have to go to Computers -&gt; MyComputer -&gt; Movies.

I don't understand how this new Apple TV is an upgrade at all. Yes, it's significantly cheaper (given that it has to be to be price-competitive with other set-top boxes and has no storage this doesn't impress me) but in all other ways it's either no benefit at all or an unqualified downgrade. Even the form factor's nice enough I suppose, but it's so small and light that its own cables try to pull it backwards off my shelf.

Am I missing something here? Why the hell would anyone want this thing over an Apple TV first-gen? Why would anyone want this thing at all? And I guess finally, does anyone have any suggestions for a device that treats my own content (preferably from ITMS) as a first-class citizen on my own television? Netflix et al is nice and all, but what the hell?

http://www.mediafire.com/file/tm6xklc2zhwqhs3/anulum-0.95.dmg

Tutorials at:
http://www.youtube.com/user/Anulum

Anulum makes interacting with OSX applications more efficient - no more moving the mouse all over the screen to perform common repetitive tasks.

Simply hold down the right mouse button to bring up a circular action menu. Touching a specific segment in the menu will perform the corresponding action, no clicking required. Actions can be customized for any application - simply assign an application specific keyboard shortcut to a segment in the circular menu using the preferences panel.

Power users can hold the right mouse button, quickly touch a segment, and release without the menu ever popping up for maximum efficiency. The scroll wheel can also be assigned actions for even more efficiency with highly repetitive actions.


**EDIT:**

Thanks to all those who have checked it out, awesome feedback - please keep it coming!  Here's the list of top improvements so far:

* Tone down the colors - make them more 'mac-like'
* Figure out how to enable trackpads / other pointing devices / other launch methods (modifier key)

apple,A tip for those who use bootcamp to game on their macs...,"Update your graphics drivers manually!

I was looking at Bejeweled on the App store and noticed there were pseudo-apps called ""Bejeweled Cheats"" for $0.99. These apps served no purpose. I noticed that people STILL bought them and left poor reviews. The reviews dated back to April of 2009 and ran all the way up to present day. 

My question: Why are people buying these apps? If I read a review that says ""APP IS GARBAGE."" Then, well, you know what? I'm moving on. Is there some sort of psychological thing going on?",15,19,2010-10-11,AAPL,0.026424521580338478,0.9219953417778015,0.05158014968037605

iphone,Getting the most/best out of your iPhone and ATT?,"Well for starters I have never been thrilled with At&amp;t, but when it comes down to it for non-jail broken iPhones there really isn’t an option.  I looked into doing the jailbreak, but it wasn’t my cup of tea and that’s a topic in itself.  

Anyhow after reading all these posts and articles about the iPhone going to Verizon (which is nothing really new, people have been saying it was going to happen since day one) I personally feel that the light at the end of the tunnel isn’t far away.  I called At&amp;t today just to ask when my contract was going to be up and what it would cost to break it.  Of course the lady on the other end of the phone showed signs as to At&amp;t already feeling the heat.  She asked my was I unhappy with the service and I told her I was interested in trying the iPhone on Verizon’s superior service.  She was quick to ask me if I wanted to be transferred to cancelation services to work something out.  The conversation got my wheels turning….


I have two iPhones on the plan, one for me and one for my wife. 

It’s basically broken down like this:

Family Nation Plan 1400 family plan w/rollover.

First line cost $80.00.
iPhone Data Plan $30.00.
iPhone 200 Msg is $5.00.

Total before taxes and such is $115.00.
After 10 bucks worth of taxes $125.00.

Second line cost $10.00.
iPhone Data Plan $30.00.
iPhone 200 Msg is $5.00.

Total before taxes and such is $45.00.
After taxes $48.00.

So after all is said and done it comes to $174.00 for two phones per month.

Out of curiosity does anyone have a similar plan and pay less?  I would expect the pricing to be similar across the board no matter what area your in.  I am just wondering if you put pressure on At&amp;t will they flex like Sprint?   I would love to get the best bang for the buck and after this last conversation with At&amp;t I feel like it may be possible to get a little more for a little less if  I go about it the right way and say the right things.",40,17,2010-10-11,AAPL,0.04842059686779976,0.919632077217102,0.0319472961127758

iphone,"Dear Reddit, with your help, my iPhone game can overtake Angry Birds. For real. Also, AMA.","I spent a year working on a game in my spare time and released it back in June. For 4 months, I had very low sales, but amazing user feedback. Two weeks ago, I made a last ditch effort to create some buzz. I decided to release the most generous lite version I could. Rather than include a couple levels like most lite versions, I included 60 brand new levels. 

A prominent Italian site tried the lite version, gave it a great review, and it almost instantly rose to the top of the Italian free chart. The buzz had finally been created. A couple days later, I got an email from Apple saying they wanted to do an App Store feature of the paid version of the game. Apple featured the game last Thursday, and since then, it's been climbing the paid app charts in every country. It currently sits at **#13 in the UK** and **#48 in the US**. This is awesome, but after the feature is over, the game will drop back off the charts unless it gets into the top 5 or 10 apps. I seriously believe this game has the potential to make the top 5 and sustain it's position there.

I think this is my one big chance to literally change my life. The paid game is called Trainyard and the lite version is Trainyard Express. The price of the game was $2.99, but **I put it on sale for 99 cents right before making this post**. The sale will last for a couple days until the game stops being featured. I'd LOVE it if you'd buy the game and tell your friends about the sale. 

I am planning on being completely transparent and honest with how this sale goes, no matter whether it fails or succeeds. I'll post hourly updates with graphs of the rank and how it has changed. Consider this an AMA as well.  

If you're not sure if the game is for you, please try Trainyard Express or just browse some of the App Store reviews, and I think you'll find that it's a pretty solid game. 


**TL:DR;** My iPhone game is on sale for 99 cents, if you buy it, I will love you forever.

For those with the 16gb iPads what do you put on it? It's pretty small compared to the 64gb version after all.

For those of you who only have the wifi version what do you do with your iPad? Can you ever get things done without having access to wifi? What sort of things do you do when you don't have wifi?

Those with 3G, do you think you could ever use you device without an Internet connection where ever you go?

I personally have the cheapest iPad, I think, the 16gb with wifi only. I don't actually know the different models offered. I find it difficult for an iPad to be worth while, unless the place I am going has free wifi. I'm still saving for some more apps that might be useful offline like those office apps.

iphone,iPhone battery life analysis (pre/post jailbreak),"If someone else (besides the Simpsons) has done this, *please* link us to their results. 

What I'd like to do is take a look at the effect on battery life for common tasks/applications on the iPhone. I realize that there might not be a perfect solution to tracking the battery percentage over time. If my process can be improved, let me know how. 

I'm thinking that I will run 2 (1) hour tests for each scenario. I will track the battery percentage with the application ""aBattery"". If someone has a better program to suggest, I am absolutely open for something better. I chose it mainly because it can disable the iPhone's sleep function &amp; export results via email. 

Scenarios I'd like to check:

* Factory default iPhone 4 w/iOS 4.1
* Immediately after jailbreak (limera1n most likely)
* SSH (on/off)
* Winterboard
* 5 column UI mod
* LockInfo (not sure how to test, run aBattery in BG?)

And after that, take requests.

apple,Back To Mac. My prediction. (Just wanted to get this down somewhere in case I'm right!),"Ok, so there are plenty of rumors as to what Apple's big announcement will be tomorrow. Higher res screens. Mac OS X 10.7. Refreshed macbook airs.

But I think people are missing something, here. Looking at the invitation to the event (http://imgur.com/OlOTX.jpg) we see the Lion - ok Mac OS X 10.7. Got it. But Apple ALWAYS puts big hints in their invitations.

Anyone notice how the apple logo is turning? In conjunction with the 'Back to the mac."" slogan, I really think this is what the 'amazing revolutionary feature' will be:

Something on the BACK of the MAC. Everyone talks about how Mac OSX 10.7 will merge the iOS and Mac OSX systems more smoothly - so touch capabilities can come to mac. But what if the new macbook Air is exactly that? When open, it's a full laptop like the macbook Air. But when you close the lid, the lid (aka the BACK of the MAC) is another screen? An iOS type device (like an iPad) which is integrated with your macbook? Like a tablet, sort of. But done right (in my opinion).

That's my idea. If I'm right, I can happily say I posted it here first (I have NOT seen this prediction anywhere in all the forums I look it). If I'm wrong, then I'm just another crazy mac fan posting his musings ;-).

Regardless, I think this would be a really neat feature either way. No? How better to merge the two OS systems than one seamless device? 

**TL;DR: LAPTOP OPEN = Macbook Air. LAPTOP CLOSED = iPad.**

Edit: I know this is Reddit, but jeez people don't take me so seriously. I don't have sources. I don't have a computer science degree. I didn't pay some guy in the Apple parking lot tons of cash for inside info. This was JUST a guess. For FUN. I was hoping people would post some of their own predictions/apple fantasies. 

Edit2: I don't mean a swivel hinge. I mean the same hinge that's already on the macbook air. It's just, instead of the Apple logo on the top - it's an ipad. :-)

Edit3: Thanks for playing guys! Nope, my guess was pretty off. But it was fun trying anyway :)

apple,"iPhoto 11, FUCK YOU!","Edit: Sorry for the bad language but this deserves to be screamed at.

I just upgraded to iLife 11, only interested in iPhoto. I use it to store and display photos I edited in Lightroom and PS and so far up to this fateful day I have been perfectly happy with the flickr export, the slick look, the fullscreen, the easy mail and the other features.

So I was pretty happy when Apple touted the new iPhoto. 
Now I'm stuck with it and boy does it suck! Seriously I can't believe how bad it is. It's all in the details, the things you only see once it's on your system. Here's just a starter of shit:

- No fullscreen viewing. That's right, you cannot view your pictures without toolbars on top and bottom all the fucking time. Fullscreen, the main feature they advertise about iPhoto 11 is actually taken away. And no, i will not use the obnoxious diashow that throws music at me every time I open it!

- Mailing pictures. Before it was easy and fast. Click on whatever you want to send, Mail.app opens and you choose the size of the pictures and you're good to go. Not anymore, no sir, because there are templates now and Apple will make sure you goddamn use them. 
They all look ugly as fuck and most if not all of them will crop your pictures to match the template.
And WHAT THE FUCK you can only mail 10 pictures max! What is wrong with the people who developed this? This is unusable even for my mom. Oh and when you actually send your less than ten pictures in a shitty cropped template of your very limited choice you can't do anything while it's sending. I was in fullscreen mode and it blocked the computer for several minutes. Well, you can do one thing and that is editing the mail while it's being sent. Why, Apple?

- When viewing albums all the flickr exports are displayed as albums as well. Because I exported most events to flickr it's like mixing the events with the albums. When I click albums I want albums. And stop using this cheesy photo pile look, Apple!

- EDIT: No zooming in anymore! I don't even...

- EDIT: Oh, and one more thing: Exporting now crashes my iPhoto because it's stuck trying to log on to Flickr. Everytime, without a chance do disable the Flickr issue.

- 2nd EDIT: Just adding a few things that came up in the thread because some of them are affecting a lot more than just the interface. Like ""You now can't remove a mistagged face without there being new possible matches."" ""Fails to install at all."" and  ""Destroyed the whole library by resizing the photos to 300x200."" No more fullscreen ""places"" editing""

I can't invest more time into this rant for health reasons but basically Apple has ruined iPhoto so utterly I can hardly believe it. And yeah, downgrading is nearly impossible without using a backed up version of the library. 
I just have the impression that the whole thing was rushed so Steve Jobs can present it himself. I hope he at least knows how bad it is.

It's shit like that Steve, shit like that!",394,355,2010-10-24,AAPL,0.16313053667545319,0.8142117857933044,0.022657686844468117

----

Hi Reddit,

I've been making iPhone and iPad apps with a few friends of mine for a few months now and my most recent one is my favorite so I thought I would share it. It's called 150 Years of World History, and with one year of history per snapshot that means it goes from 1861 to 2010. 

http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/150-years-world-history-hd/id398191545?mt=8

The app is to give an overall feel of how humanity has progressed, and sometimes regressed, over the past century and a half by year instead of just leaping from major event to major event, and also to serve as a quick book to download and read for a few hours in case you are about to meet someone you know is a history buff and want to brush up on what happened when.

I'm not a developer myself - I make content for these apps that I send to them which they then turn into a shiny app.

Promo codes: looking over the subreddit I see people burn through them pretty quickly, but since this is an app on history I thought it could be made a bit more fun. Here is a screenshot of 30 years from 1951 to 1980:

http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/057/Purple/16/b5/2c/mzl.dlxxlnjy.320x480-75.jpg

So write down one of the events seen there and I'll send you a promo code. Some of them are painfully easy even at low res and it shouldn't take long at all to send out all 15 of them.

Don't worry about being too specific - just naming the person or thing in the image is enough and I'll fill in the details on why they show up for that year.

----

Edit after the promo codes have been given away: the rest of the images are pretty vague so here are what they represent, going from left to right:

First row: 2nd image is Von Braun. That year he wrote quite a bit about how humanity would soon conquer space. Two images over is the Boeing 707, starting the age of the jet.

Second row: 1st image is the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, the next year African nations began regaining their independence and the image is a map from former times, then on the far right is Gabon's coat of arms as 1960 was the year a ton of African nations regained their independence (year of Africa).

Third row: Yuri Gagarin (1st man in space), two over is the Malaysian flag (Singapore was a part of it for a little bit), then on the far right we have the US getting involved in the ground in Vietnam and General Westmoreland can be seen there.

Fourth row: 2nd picture the Shah has his official coronation even though he had already ruled the country for a long time by then, then Nauru becomes independent (the smallest island country in the world)

Fifth row: East Pakistan is now Bangladesh, 4th image is tough to see but it's a collection of images during the oil crisis when prices skyrocketed and gas stations didn't have enough.

Sixth row: Mars Viking mission, 3rd image are anti-Shah protests that ended in the Iranian/Islamic Revolution the following year...and that's all of them! For the 1951 - 1980 period, that is.",38,16,2010-10-24,AAPL,0.03789927437901497,0.9173580408096313,0.04474267736077309

apple,"Share your most creative and best uses of DropBox, Hazel, Automator, Growl, etc.","I have been going on a spree of automating my computer using Dropbox, Hazel, Automator, and Growl. Please share your best ideas so that we can all be hip and more productive. I have a few of my favorites that I would like to share. 

A quick overview of each application

------------------------------------------

[Dropbox](http://dropboxroulette.appspot.com/roll): Adds a folder to your Finder that syncs across multiple computers the instant a file changes within the Dropbox folder. (*If you don't have it, get it. You won't regret it. But make sure you **use this link** I provided. It gives you an extra 250MB!*)

EDIT: This Dropbox link now uses the Dropbox roulette. Each person who clicks on the link will get a different referral. Hope some people enjoy this.

[Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php): Automate your computer according to rules set within Hazel

[Automator](http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/apps-and-utilities.html#automator): Automation built into every Mac

[Growl](http://growl.info/): Notifies of actions performed by applications in the form of customizable pop-ups.

 
------------------------------------------

**Sharing songs between my girlfriend and I using Dropbox, Hazel, and Growl:**

We both have a Dropbox account that we share. It contains folders called ""Ashley"" and ""Tyler."" If my girlfriend wants to give me a song, she drops an .mp3 or .m4a into ""Tyler,"" and it syncs to my computer, where Hazel is watching the folder for those file types. When it finds a song, it imports it into iTunes to a playlist called ""Ashley"", sends a Growl notification saying the song has been added, and then moves the song into the trash can. This is great because we are both in college and I am able to use file sharing, but she not, so I give her a lot of songs and albums. If I drop a song into Ashley, the same thing happens on her computer (add to iTunes, Growl, delete).

Hazel Settings: [mp3/m4a](http://i.imgur.com/wodCd.png)


**Send a .torrent from my college Macbook Pro to a computer running at home so it can download it, and use Dropbox to send it back to me. (can't use torrents at college, so this is a little more sneaky)** Uses Hazel, Dropbox, Growl for Mac, Growl for Windows, uGrowl (Allows Windows Growl to watch uTorrent)

Download torrents either as .txt (more secretive) or .torrent, have Hazel convert the .txt to a .torrent, and then move the .torrent from the Downloads folder to a folder in my Dropbox called ""Auto."" uTorrent on the computer at my house (Windows 7) watches this Dropbox directory for torrents, automatically adds the torrent, starts the download, and once it finishes, it moves it to a Dropbox folder called ""Finished."" A Growl alert on the Windows machine appears when a download finishes, as well as sends a growl alert over the internet to my Macbook at college so I know when to look back in my Dropbox and get the completed torrent's files. 


**Make a symbolic link in a Dropbox folder so that it syncs.**

ie. My ""Documents"" folder contains all my college papers and info, and it is the default save place for Office and other programs, well, because its the documents folder. Instead of changing all of the save folders, I make a symbolic link. In terminal type:

    ln -s /Users/[USERNAME]/*folder I want to sync with Dropbox* /Users/[USERNAME]/*path to Dropbox folder*

A simple way to do this is to type `ln -s!` and then drag the folder you want to sync into the terminal window, then drag the Dropbox folder into the terminal window, and click ENTER.

------------------------------------------

EDIT: Felt like adding this one

**Keep desktop free of old files:** Uses Hazel

I use my desktop for quick and temporary storage. It becomes cluttered often. So what I do is run Hazel scripts to keep it organized. For anything that hasn't been opened, changed, or added within the past week gets moved to ""Stale Desktop."" For anything that is in ""Stale Desktop"" that has been recently opened or modified, it gets moved back to the desktop.

[Hazel 1](http://i.imgur.com/PPyes.png)

[Hazel 2](http://i.imgur.com/QFdAw.png)


So there you have it, those are my favorites. Now show me something better and more creative so I and others can steal it.

mac,Wishful thinking for OS X Lion,"When Steve Jobs and other Apple luminaries gave us a sneak peek at OS X 10.7 Lion, at [October's Back to the Mac event](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1010qwoeiuryfg/event/index.html), it got me thinking about some of the things we've been waiting to see on the Mac for some years which are never likely to appear now that the platform wars are focused on mobile devices and the desktop is effectively entering its twilight years.

Yes, graphical improvements to Exposé and Spaces are always welcome.  And the iPad style changes to the Dock are definitely an improvement.  We Mac users like our eye candy more now than ever before.  But it takes more than a couple of new iMovie templates and iPhoto slideshow presets to divert attention away from the fact that Finder hasn't been updated in forever and we still have to run two different versions of Quicktime Player just to make basic edits to audio and video.

Not that new announcements always have to be about grand gestures.  There's more than a few little things we've been looking forward to Apple fixing for some time too—like the pop-up error message you get if you remove a USB device without ejecting it properly—which even Windows stopped doing years ago—and the lack of a fully integrated backup and restore application that doesn't require the user to manually fetch and carry every Preference Pane and Library folder from a Time Machine archive.  Or the way Finder will stop an operation if just one of the files you want to move or copy from one volume to another is currently open—even if this is a false positive.  Disk Utility still doesn't fix file permissions properly unless you run it from the OS X installer disc.  The wish list is almost endless.

Then there's customisation.  I've been a Mac user for nearly 20 years and I still have no idea how to use Automator.  I know it should be drag and drop simple and I know people who understand AppleScript already say it is, but to ordinary users like me it's still far too complicated.  I spent a week trying to get TextEdit to paste the content of the clipboard, strip page breaks and insert some basic HTML, before finding out that Automator doesn't fully support TextEdit scripting and has a strange bug which records every mouse movement in ultra-slow motion which can only be stopped by forcing the entire machine to restart.

I suppose what we long-time Mac users ultimately wished for from OS X Lion, in reality is more than any mere Operating System can ever hope to deliver—but that's sort of my point.  Once upon a time, Apple used to glory in bringing something exceptional to the Mac; something no-one expected them to do.  Whereas these days we're already hearing feedback on iPhoto 11 which is a sad echo of the sort of criticism once reserved for Microsoft's half efforts at copying the Mac; an overly simplistic interface, no customisation, retrogressive changes to fullscreen controls, a lack of professional level import / export capabilities, and so on.

I'm sure when it eventually arrives, OS X Lion will be a great improvement to Snow Leopard in the way Leopard was to Tiger—but I fear some of the unique idiosyncrasies which have been rattling around inside OS X's belly ever since Panther will remain—and those of us who champion the Mac to our friends and family every day will still face the inevitable barrage of questioning about ""only having one mouse button"" and ""no software"".

It would have been nice to finally bury at least one of these myths, with what we really wanted to hear Steve Jobs say; that Apple had finally begun to integrate into iLife and iWork some of the software we all know Apple's R &amp; D department has been sitting on for years—like a Photoshop killer level of image editing and an update to Pages that kicks Microsoft's Word into the dirt.  It's looking more and more like this has now been pushed back to the 2050 release of OS X Mountain Goat.

Obviously those machines will need a way to upgrade to 10.7, and the remote disc stuff, while it works, doesn't seem very Apple-ish. We know next to _nothing_ about Lion at this point, and I'm not convinced that Apple is out to kill the optical disc. But I wonder: Will the next version of Mac OS X ship, not on a DVD, but on a USB key?

* Since we've been pressing and distributing these optical discs for decades, that they're incredibly cheap to produce in quantity. So the USB key would be (marginally) more expensive to produce, right?
* It'd be many times faster than installing from DVD.
* I think all modern Macs can boot from USB. (Again, we don't know the system requirements, but we can be certain PPC-based Macs are out)
* What purpose would they have for still distributing it on DVD? (well, besides great artwork on the disc itself).",241,138,2010-10-30,AAPL,0.01310189999639988,0.882618248462677,0.10427982360124588

apple,"I'm about to switch to Mac after a lifetime of owning a PC. /r/apple, can you give me some advice?","For all my life I've owned and worked on PCs with Windows. I now own a three year old Dell laptop, with a somewhat outdated configuration (1.6 GHz Centrino, 1GB of RAM and a 64 mb video card). When I'm at home, I keep it plugged in to a 19"" monitor, and I'm hoping to do the same with the upcoming Mac. Ever since I saw the ads for the New Macbook Air I've been thinking about getting one, and recently I made up my mind - I'm selling this one and cutting all ties with the PC world, for the time being.

Initially, my plan was to keep both, but there is the financial issue, as Apple computers aren't cheap at all. I'm a college student, with a variable small income, with anywhere between 200 and 600$ a month, so putting together the money will be somewhat difficult. I've got my eyes on the basic 13"" model - seeing that I manage fine with my current computer, I don't think there will be any trouble not having the top of the line model.

Are there any things I need to know/look out for? Do you have any advice for me to take into consideration? 

EDIT: I'm not from the US, so all of the the ""usual"" offers may not apply to me. I'm from Romania, and sadly we don't have an Apple Store here, only resellers, and they tend to up the prices a bit in order to make a profit. Sorry, should have mentioned that first.

EDIT 2: I also forgot to specify what I'll use it for: internet surfing, a lot of MS Office, a few programs on the side, movies, music and a few games. I'm not a hardcore user, but I'm savvy enough not to screw it up.

EDIT 3: From what I'm hearing, the Air shouldn't be my only computer. Should I rather go with the Macbook / Macbook Pro? 

EDIT 4: Woah, I've never had this much attention about one of my threads. Thanks everybody for their contribution, you've really given me some perspective. I'm now torn between a 13"" MBA or a 13"" MBP, I'll make up my mind down the line.

ipad,"Serious Linux user here, and I bought an iPad.","So, I have been a serious Linux user (and currently admin a mainly *nix based network during the day) for over 10 years. I wanted a new tablet, as it is what I have used for a very long time (TC1000, Toshiba M200, and a Fujitsu T4215). 

	I considered an Android tablet, but not only are the options laughable (yes, even the Galaxy Tab), but the software to take advantage of the increased screen real estate is virtually nonexistent. Enter: buying the iPad.

	I was definitely reserved, having played with iPhones and the iPad as well. I abhor iTunes, i hate the crappy filesystem retardedness, and I am not really a fan of Apple's prices either. But I bought one safe in the knowledge that if i didn't like it, i could return it and/or sell it for pretty much any asking price I wanted. Turns out that other than initial setup and sync (for which I used a virtualized copy of XP and, obviously, iTunes) I haven't even had a need for syncing. I pretty much stream everything. Awesome.

	On top of that, during my day job, it makes one kick ass administrator's tool. SSH, console monitoring, notes. Very slick and portable, and I don't feel like I am going to die walking from one end of the plant to the other. Even better still is the fact that I don't even have to bring my charger to work with me anymore. That is a convenience that is beyond words. Good luck doing that with any regular tablet PC. I have tried.

	Email, web browsing, pandora, media center control and even gaming is leaps and bounds better than a regular computer. I was never a gamer before I got the iPad. I am not so much a creative type, so editing photos/videos and the like don't really interest me, but Sketchbook and Notes Plus have made me so happy that I don't feel bad about losing my Wacom digitizer. The unit is also very well built and makes me feel very confident while handling it.

	Any linux users, feel free to sound off about helpful tips and workarounds, I can only hope libimobiledevice fixes the iPad sync issues soon. And I feel I should add, the iPad has pretty much convinced me that I want a Mac Mini... damn you shiny gadget!

TL;DR version: Basically I am a hardcore linux neckbeard sociopath, and I bought an iPad and it kicks ass. I would have never guessed that I'd like it this much.",28,21,2010-10-31,AAPL,0.044423073530197144,0.9187818765640259,0.03679504245519638
