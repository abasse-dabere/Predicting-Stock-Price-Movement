Anyway, I sync'd up google calendar as per instructions from google, and it worked, except the only calendar that is on my iPhone is the one that is named by my email address. I have several calendars within my google calendar, for organization purposes. For example, I keep really important things on my komali...@gmail.com calendar, then I have my ""english reading assignments"" calendar, ""math homework"", etc. None of my extra calendars transferred over.

apple,Where the heck do you get a micro-SIM for the iPad?  Apple's got your back...,"For me the mention that the iPad uses a Micro-SIM was the first I'd heard about that SIM format.   Clearly, based on many media reports about micro-SIMS that people are considering shaving down regular sims in order to be able to use an iPad right out of the gate.  

This is understandable because nobody in the US uses micro-SIMS right now.  Not AT&amp;T nor T-Mobile (The two GSM carriers.)

But what I initially missed, and everyone else seems to be missing is that Apple already announced the solution.  During the Stevenote Steve said (paraphrased) ""You'll be able to activate your AT&amp;T service right from the iPad.""   

Of course, my initial thought was ""thank god, Apple provided a good software solution for AT&amp;T so we don't have to deal with AT&amp;T reps or AT&amp;T crappy website"".

But I missed the piont hidden in there-- how is this possible?

**The solution is obvious, and very Apple:  The iPad ships with a micro-SIM inside it already.**

You don't have to find a carrier that supports micro-SIMS, you just use this Apple app that Steve alluded to, which conects over wifi or over the network -- using the internal micro-SIM -- to set up billing and configure the device for the carrier.

This is the reverse of the typical carrier sales cycle.  You dont' wait in a mall for some teenager to activate your account and configure your device, and thus get your SIM.  You get the device from apple and activate it yourself.   Further, the iPhone ships with a SIM and Apple has built activation into iTunes.  With the iPadt they've taken the final step and you could use the iPad without ever needing to actually connect it to iTunes-- activation is built in. 

I think this is a great technological feat given what's involved, but as is typical for apple, they made it so easy that it was essentially invisible. 

Please don't downmod if you already figured this out.  I'm still reading articles at sites like engadget speculating on how we can make microsims from regular sims, etc.   Clearly many people haven't connected the dots on this one, and when I did, I wanted to share.",36,31,2010-02-02,AAPL,0.05398022383451462,0.915541410446167,0.030478378757834435

* No popover ads.

* Volume bar does not work. [At least for me, on the chrome dev build]

* Spacebar pause/play not working.

apple,MBP laptop display does not wake up after sleeping for 2 + hours when connected to external display; AppleCare suggested restarting every time it happens.,"Background: I have a non-unibody 15"" MBP attached to a 23"" Acer Widescreen HD Display.  My computer is set to never go to sleep and the displays are set to sleep after 30 minutes.  I leave my computer on almost all the time and twice in the past four days when I go to wake my computer up in the morning, the external display responds but my laptop display does nothing.  Naturally the first time it happened I restarted my computer and the display starting working, so I thought it was a one time deal.  It happened again this morning, but instead of restarting, I called AppleCare for assistance.  The tech suggested I change my energy settings for my displays to never go to sleep (!!), take notes when it happens again and restart to fix the problem.  Normally I would be a bit frustrated with this response and ignore it until it became a bigger issue; but I am leaving in a month to do research on a ship in the middle of the pacific ocean for 34 days where I will not have an external display or constant internet access, so if this issue decides to become a bigger issue while I am at sea, I am fucked.  Because AppleCare was a waste of time and a simple google search did not turn up anything useful, I am posting here in the hopes that someone will a) have experienced this problem before and know how to fix it or b) tell me something more useful than ""restart"".

tl;dr - My laptop display doesn't wake up after 2+ hours of sleeping and I need to figure out why as soon as possible.

EDIT: I have tried ""detecting displays"" when my laptop display is unresponsive.  Doesn't work.

EDIT 2: I really appreciate everyone's responses: not only are you awesome, you are useful :)

UPDATES: Because of Keat83's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/axmqq/mbp_laptop_display_does_not_wake_up_after/c0jxiul), I called Apple Care again to see if this issue is a result of a jacked NVIDIA card.  I got a different tech this time who quickly put me through to the ""Senior"" tech.  Apparently my issue is not related to the NVIDIA card, maybe, but is something Chris has never heard of before.  We deleted some Power Management Preferences in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration and he *thinks* that should fix the problem.  Otherwise I have to call him back and most likely send in my computer.  I will try and keep this updated until it is fixed for those who have this issue in the future.

iphone,"Buy a 3GS now, or wait for a potential iPhone 4G?","I'm growing tired of my Nokia 5800 (iPhone killer, yeah right), so I'm finally growing the balls to spend all that money on a phone that _just works_. I already have an iPod Touch, so I know from experience what the iPhone OS is capable of compared to phones I've had before (ironic when my MP3-player is a better smartphone than my smartphones). However, I'm thinking about whether or not it's a good idea to wait a few months and see if Apple releases a new model. From what I can gather, it would be around May/June, which isn't that far from now. Then again, what can Apple put in the phone that it doesn't have already, and that I might actually _need_. Will it just be bling?

What do you think? Are there any rumors that sound believable? Do you think it'd be worth the wait?

Edit: Thanks guys! Seems I'll wait. A faster chip does seem likely, if the speed of the iPad is anything to go by, and I wouldn't say no to a better camera.

Edit: I forgot to mention I want to do it without having to buy or configure any additional external hardware. I want to all be done in OS X. Both are currently connected, I can switch between the two, but I can't use both at the same time. How can I use both at the same time?

Edit 2: If I can't do it easily via software (which seems to be the case), I might just put my downloads in a VM and have it use the DSL connection as its main.",20,4,2010-02-11,AAPL,0.023202864453196526,0.9460089802742004,0.030788127332925797

apple,Dear AppleReddit: Need boot help. I kinda jacked up my new MacBook Pro.,"Okay, so I decided to try and use BootCamp and install Win7RC (Build 7100) on a 40gig partition on my base model 13"" MBP.

I used BootCamp Assistant to create the 40gig partition and proceeded to install Win7. Win7 said it couldn't install on the BC partition because of incorrect formatting, so I told the installer to format the partition to NTFS and finished installing.

Needless to say, I found Win7 to be a pain in the ass because half of the things in my MBP didn't work and didn't have Win7 equivalent drivers. So, I got fed up with it and decided to wipe the partition and merge it back with my main OSX partition.

This basically went fine (after I figured out how to boot back into OSX by holding the Option key during startup), but now the MBP keeps trying to boot into the missing partition and stalls out whenever I reboot unless I do the Option key thing and tell it to boot from the OSX partition.

So, the question is: how do I set the machine so that it automatically boots back into the correct OSX partition?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",16,6,2010-02-13,AAPL,0.09162429720163345,0.8511430621147156,0.05723267421126366

apple,Hey /r/apple - When you want to find a new application what's the first download site you try?,"I know that they say for every little organising job there's an Apple Script or Automator Action—but I'm just not smart enough to figure that stuff out for myself.

I, like millions of other Mac users, rely on those clever people out there who are also generous enough to share either for free or a nominal fee, their useful little single function apps.

But where do you turn when you need one of these little applications in a hurry?  It's all very well using the built-in Apple Menu shortcut to the apple.com download page when you know the name of a widget or shareware app you've already used before.  But what about finding new applications and hidden gems?

Here's a list of some of the download sites I use.  If you know of more, please leave a comment.

http://osx.iusethis.com/ - Works like reddit to upvote or downvote applications you use or recommend

http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/ - The filter to hide commercial and demo versions doesn't always work, but there's usually always a niche app on here when no other site can help

http://mac.softpedia.com/ - Another site which makes it hard to search for indy developers over big commercial titles

http://download.cnet.com/mac/ - Download.com from CNet

http://macupdate.com/ - Another frustratingly slow to load, doesn't always work filter design—but at least you can search by free / open / shareware without jumping through hoops

She claimed that there was no ""uninstall"" option when I told her to reverse the process. Figuring it was just hidden, I thought I'd investigate the installer program myself. Turns out there's no uninstall option, nor is there an install option. You simply open the program, it asks for your password, and it begins auto-installation without doing so much as popping up an EULA. Is this even legal?

apple,"Would you buy a 13"" Macbook Pro, the same size as the current model, with no optical drive but a 10 hour battery life?","I have a current model 17"" MacbookPro5,2.  The first thing I did with it when I got it was remove the DVDRW drive and install an Intel SSD in a $40 caddy in its place.  My wife has a 13"" Macbook from late 2008, the same form factor as the current 13"" Macbook Pro.  

I was looking at it yesterday and considering the huge percentage of its volume that is occupied by the DVDRW.  It is in my opinion a media type that is rapidly making itself obsolete, with bootable flash drives, remote disc, and 2GB to 8GB sized H.264 720p/1080p files of movies copied across the WAN/LAN that are better quality than 480p DVD.  

Because the 13"" MBP uses the same flat/square cell battery technology as the current 15"" and 17"", it's already supposed to have superb battery life.  If they used the volume occupied by that drive for more battery, about half of a 13"" MBP could be battery.  It would probably result in a laptop with a 10 hour real-world battery life.

apple,Steve Jobs doesn't want Flash on his iPlatform for the following reason,"Apple doesn't like to just 'implement a feature', they like to 'revolutionize' it. My Motorola RAZR had a ""web browser""... except it didn't really. It was pure crap and nobody used it.  

What the iPhone web browser brought to the table was a fast, responsive browser that displayed the whole page quickly, introduced swipe to scroll, double tap to zoom in on an element and the ability to rotate the device to view in landscape. All this happens immediately. Not click a button and wait for the program to action my request.  

It does all that, and cleverly obfuscates areas where there is any lag time (you can scroll rapidly with your finger, and if the device hasn't had time to render the revealed part of the webpage you see the checkerboard pattern... but the difference is my finger swipe was registered and displayed a logical response instantly).  

The iPhone browser is all about perceived responsiveness. Apple wants you to be confident that when you touch the screen with your fingertip and do something it responds instantly and in the manner that you intended. ""It just works"" (although it doesn't always... but Apple has the best shot at achieving it if it has tight control over everything).  

There is no conceivable way that a page containing running flash animations or movies will be able to nimbly accommodate that directive. Rotate your device with a bunch of Flash animations running? You think the screen will quickly respond?  

**tl;dr** Jobs wants his mobile web browser to be the 'snappiest', most ergonomic multi-touch experience out there and adding plugin support ruins that.",37,42,2010-02-20,AAPL,0.028198253363370895,0.9276579022407532,0.044143807142972946

apple,I overheard this at the Apple display in a Best Buy today.,"A potential ""switcher"" was discussing the display of MacBook Pros with a Best Buy sales associate, who sounded reasonably knowledgeable about Macs.  When the customer asked about Apple's extended warranty, the sales associate said he didn't recommend Apple's extended warranty, it didn't cover batteries, which is particularly problematic in the unibody MacBooks, and recommended Best Buy's extended warranty instead.

Sheesh.  While the associate was off checking on something, I sidled over to the customer and explained that the associate's remark about Applecare simply wasn't true--I had personally benefitted from Applecare coverage when I had a MBP battery lose capacity prematurely, after about 100 recharge cycles.

I also blurted out, in front of the sales associate, that a MacBook Pro hardware refresh was rumored to be imminent, and when I bumped into the customer again in the parking lot I recommended he visit the local Mac store (an independent chain of Apple resellers here in the Pacific Northwest, where I got that battery replaced).

apple,Why I'll probably be buying Apple gear for some time to come.,"So I bought an iPhone 3g almost a year ago. I take pretty good care of it. It usually sits in my pocket, or on the desk next to me. I don't use a case, but like I said, I take good care of it. It's never been dropped, except one time it fell out of my pocket onto the carpeting in the car. Anyway...

Last week I notice there is a small crack developing on the rear panel near the dock connector. Now, as I said, it's not been dropped. So I call the Apple store. They set up an appointment for 17:15. I walk in, and get help right on time. The genius asks me what the problem is. I tell him about the cracks. He checks the warranty, says it is still under the warranty, and just replaces the phone. All without asking what caused the cracks. In about 3 minutes. By 5 minutes, I was walking out with a new phone.

I've had problems with phones before, like my wife's blackberry on t-mobile. It was like the goddamned spanish inquisition. ""Are you sure you didn't get it wet? REALLY SURE?"" Or a Treo on Verizon, in which the rep said that she didn't think I followed the four steps she gave me correctly. The steps that I told her I'd already tried before I called. The Blackberry problem got solved. The Treo problem did not (which is how I ended up buying a 2g iPhone, so suck it, Palm.)

apple,Have you guys ever defragmented your Mac's hard drive?,"So, I know Macs are supposed to ""just work"" and their filesystems are made in such a way to prevent fragmentation, but it can happen.  Here's what happened to me.

After upgrading to Aperture 3, I noticed that it was running dog slow. Tons of pinwheels often when just trying to select the next picture in my library.  Starting it was also a nightmare.  Sometimes it took more than a minute. It wasn't really using up a lot of resources though.  still had 500 some megs of free ram, and it was using up maybe 50% of one of my cores.  Well, what could be the problem then?

I looked around online and found that doing something like an Aperture upgrade can seriously fragment your filesystem.  It involved adding/modifying metadata on upwards of 80 gigs of images.

I downloaded the demo of iDefrag and saw [this](http://www.antiyawn.com/uploads/beforedefrag.png).  (red is bad).  Also, the top 6 most fragmented files on my drive were all Aperture database files (which were several orders of magnitude more fragmented than the next in line).

So i went ahead and forked over the $30 for the full version and did a defrag off the bootable CD it makes for you.  Now it looks like [this](http://www.antiyawn.com/uploads/afterdefrag.png), and Aperture is running much faster.

Has anyone else here had to defrag their Mac?
