So I downloaded it on my iPhone (free, you can get the PRO version within the app for $1.99) and I like it much better than iReddit.

On the iPad, however, there is no free version of Alien Blue. On the iPad it's called Alien Blue HD and it runs for $3.99. I figured that since I enjoyed the iPhone version, I might as well buy the iPad version. And I love it. Definitely worth it. It makes browsing reddit even better than the browser version. 

So I compared iReddit and Alien Blue, and there's really no comparison. Definitely Alien Blue. So if you have a couple of bucks to spend, I'd say check it out. You definitely won't regret it!",61,57,2011-10-02,AAPL,0.016112109646201134,0.8585589528083801,0.1253288984298706

apple,"What if the Mods to set up a consolidated discussion thread for tomorrow's ""Let's Talk iPhone"" event?","There always seems to be the desire to keep the reposts on /r/apple down to a minimum, which I agree with in general. So I'm wondering if anyone, mods and subscribers alike, thinks it would be a good or bad idea for the mods to create a sort of mini-blog to direct all of the breaking news. That way the front page won't be flooded with the same headlines over and over.

Set it up a few hours in advance, and pin it to the top of the subreddit like an announcement. They'd be able to update the text at the top of the thread to include anything new, as it hits, and we'd be able to discuss below. Sort of a blogcast / IRC mashup.

Plus, if the mods do it and throw up that big, beautiful [M], you'll probably avoid the karma whoring that goes along with mass posting.

It ain't ideal, I realize, but I think it would certainly cut down on the clutter that we typically see during Apple presentations. I don't know, maybe even if it a try as a test run, see if it works, and keep it up for future events if it does the trick.

apple,"If the 4s is a 'minor spec bump', exactly what the hell is a modest or major spec bump?","Had Apple announced the iPhone 5 today, I imagine the comments here would be something like this....

* Larger screen? Way to finally catch up to everyone else Apple. Higher resolution to maintain DPI? Way to fuck over the devs as usual. Apple is evil.

* Pfft. Aluminum back? teardrop design? So it's just a scaled down iPad 2. Pass.

You want all the rumored specs, *all of them*, for $299, don't you?

Let's recap what you *can* get here:

1080p video. **TEN. FUCKING. EIGHTY. PEES.** Seriously, this isn't fucking enough for you? 

1gig ram. Twice as much as the 4. Exactly what everyone was salivating for, now you have it, and you're bitching that it's ""minor"". 

Dual Core CPU and 7x graphics. As in it will smoke every other phone out there *today*. You know, like in the iPad 2. 

64gb storage. (I know it's $100 more. I don't care. I'm getting it) If this isn't enough for you, fuck you, because absolutely no other phone even comes *close* to this much built in storage.

Everything else: iCloud (free. FREE.), Siri, wireless synching, notifications, twitter, fastest camera for taking pics, dual antennas.

Oh, and you can take the phone to whichever of the big 3 carriers you choose. 

You're going to jump ship to Android because Apple is evil and ""fucked you all over?""

I will just be careful next time. 

The Genius at the Apple store looked at it, pronounced it dead, and told me ""this counts as accidental damage, and normally is not covered under warranty, but Apple will be more than happy to replace it for free."" He then proceeded to get me a new phone, synced my phone number and I was out of the store in 20 minutes.

I don't know of any other experience with a company where the damage was totally my fault and I got this kind of service. So happy just sharing. Cheers.",53,115,2011-10-07,AAPL,0.037118684500455856,0.9105449318885803,0.052336376160383224

apple,Fuck Michael Dell. Steve Jobs,"I remember being at a talk he gave shortly after returning in 1997 as Interim CEO. A bunch of us employees (I was at ATG at the time) were in Town Hall in Building 4 at Infinite Loop to hear him, and he was fired up. Talked a lot about how Apple was going to completely turn things around and become great.

It was a tough time at Apple — we were trading below book value on the market — our enterprise value was actually less than our cash on hand. And the rumors were everywhere that we were going to be acquired by Sun. Someone in the audience asked him about Michael Dell’s suggestion in the press a few days previous that Apple should just shut down and return the cash to shareholders, and as I recall, Steve’s response was: “Fuck Michael Dell.”

apple,Two year android fan just got the 4S,"Just some thoughts for anyone wo cares...

Backstory. I was an Evo 4G user, it was the first ""4G"" phone running on the WiMAX network. It packed superior specs and was Engadget's second place phone last year, behind the iPhone 4. I used it stock for several months before rooting the device. I spent many months with Cyanogenmod and other various Roms including MIUI and sense 3.0. 

I switched because I have a Mac Mini, iPad and Apple TV and want to stay in the ecosystem (shuffle too but does that count? PS. Is there any competition for the shuffle yet? $50 bucks with shipping and engraving?!). Impressions:

- holy Christmas the *KEYBOARD on the 4S is amazing. I've used about five different android keyboards (stock HTC, stock gingerbread, smart keyboard, swiftkey X, and swype) and never had one even close to this good

- *SMOOTH as silk speed throughout, android always had inconsistencies depending on the app (and other issues like when 4G was on my phone would run much slower. What is up with that??)

- my iPhone is on AT&amp;amp;T and I am frequently pulling down 4mbs in downtown Boston. Compared to sprint 3G CDMA that's at least four times faster. Versus 4G, that's about even with WiMAX occasionally reaching higher. However, it's not really a competition because with WiMAX on, my Evo could not get more than 6 hours of battery life  regardless of use. This is due to how poor the WiMAX radio functions in the phone. *It made using 4G a rare moment as I rarely had it on*

- love how uniform the iOS experience is.  *Different apps all function similarly.* Settings make sense and are grouped together (not sure why mail doesn't have the pull down refresh like most other apps though...) EDIT: apparently it was a third party who created the down swipe and Apple has yet to embrace it. I personally hope they do, it feels natural to me for an app like mail. 

- hardware quality is out of this world. Goes without saying I suppose


Lastly, support. My first 4S had an over sensitive accelerometer causing the phone to switch to landscape wayyy to soon, I.e. when being set on a flat surface. Made a genius appointment, got a new device and restored all my early settings and data. No problem. 

And you can't really put a price on that kind of customer service.",561,552,2011-10-17,AAPL,0.0363723486661911,0.9301380515098572,0.03348960727453232

iphone,My local UPS delivery driver: True American Hero (tm),"I pre-ordered the iPhone 4s (upgrade from a 3GS) a week before release. I was pretty excited for the upgrade, so when I realized I had to be in NYC for work (Comic Con -- it was nuts) the day it was being shipped I was maybe a little bummed. I had tried to reroute the shipment to my hotel, but that failed.

Luckily my girlfriend was around on Friday so she could at least sign for the package... that was until she got a Jury Summons earlier in the week and had to show up for the selection process that morning. She left a kind note to UPS stating she was serving jury duty and asked if he could leave the package behind. Because an in-person signature was required, he was unable to do so and left a note back saying he would make a second attempt on Monday before 10AM.

That evening, my girlfriend decided to take a trip to NYC to visit me and as she was walking out the door she hears the UPS truck roaring down the street. He pulls right up to the house and excitedly gets out and hands her the package from Apple. He said he was ""so glad to find you, I've driven down this street 3 or 4 times since my first attempt -- I figured your boyfriend would really want his delivery today instead of waiting for Monday!""

It's not often you hear a good story about a delivery driver, so I just thought I'd share. :)

apple,"""Apple stole its ideas from Xerox""","I've seen this claim thrown around a lot lately. Every time someone points out how Microsoft and now Google have been continually taking Apple's ideas and using Apple's innovations, someone always seems to come in and say ""Well, Apple is no different. It stole the notion of the mouse and the GUI from Xerox, so Steve Jobs is a hypocrite for criticizing Microsoft/Google/Samsung"".

Well, that claim is absolutely false. I just came across a **[great article from The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/16/110516fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=1)** that thoroughly debunks that myth.

Firstly, there's the fact that Xerox's ideas were not stolen, rather, Xerox intentionally and willfully showcased them to Apple in exchange for significant stock options prior to Apple's much anticipated IPO. The reason Xerox did this is because the PARC/Alto project was going nowhere, the computer was bulky, cumbersome, incredibly expensive, unreliable, and was never intended to be sold as a consumer product. Xerox's management rejected the whole project so instead, it was decided that it should be shown to the biggest name in computer innovation at the time (Apple) to see what they could do with it in exchange for stock options.

Secondly, what Apple did is not even remotely similar to what Xerox had. What Apple implemented was so far removed and so vastly improved, that it wasn't even reminiscent of Xerox's computer.

Here's are some great excerpts from the article:

&gt; After Jobs returned from parc, he met with a man named Dean Hovey, who was one of the founders of the industrial-design firm that would become known as ideo. “Jobs went to Xerox parc on a Wednesday or a Thursday, and I saw him on the Friday afternoon,” Hovey recalled. “I had a series of ideas that I wanted to bounce off him, and I barely got two words out of my mouth when he said, ‘No, no, no, you’ve got to do a mouse.’ I was, like, ‘What’s a mouse?’ I didn’t have a clue. **So he explains it, and he says, ‘You know, [the Xerox mouse] is a mouse that cost three hundred dollars to build and it breaks within two weeks. Here’s your design spec: Our mouse needs to be manufacturable for less than fifteen bucks. It needs to not fail for a couple of years, and I want to be able to use it on Formica and my bluejeans.’** From that meeting, I went to Walgreens, which is still there, at the corner of Grant and El Camino in Mountain View, and I wandered around and bought all the underarm deodorants that I could find, because they had that ball in them. I bought a butter dish. That was the beginnings of the mouse.”

&gt; **...**

&gt; **Here is the first complicating fact about the Jobs visit. In the legend of Xerox parc, Jobs stole the personal computer from Xerox. But the striking thing about Jobs’s instructions to Hovey is that he *didn’t* want to reproduce what he saw at parc.** “You know, there were disputes around the number of buttons—three buttons, two buttons, one-button mouse,” Hovey went on. “The mouse at Xerox had three buttons. But we came around to the fact that learning to mouse is a feat in and of itself, and to make it as simple as possible, with just one button, was pretty important.”

&gt; So was what Jobs took from Xerox the idea of the mouse? Not quite, because Xerox never owned the idea of the mouse. The parc researchers got it from the computer scientist Douglas Engelbart, at Stanford Research Institute, fifteen minutes away on the other side of the university campus. Engelbart dreamed up the idea of moving the cursor around the screen with a stand-alone mechanical “animal” back in the mid- nineteen-sixties. His mouse was a bulky, rectangular affair, with what looked like steel roller-skate wheels. **If you lined up Engelbart’s mouse, Xerox’s mouse, and Apple’s mouse, you would not see the serial reproduction of an object. You would see the evolution of a concept.**

&gt; **The same is true of the graphical user interface that so captured Jobs’s imagination. Xerox parc’s innovation had been to replace the traditional computer command line with onscreen icons. But when you clicked on an icon you got a pop-up menu: this was the intermediary between the user’s intention and the computer’s response. Jobs’s software team took the graphical interface a giant step further. It emphasized “direct manipulation.” If you wanted to make a window bigger, you just pulled on its corner and made it bigger; if you wanted to move a window across the screen, you just grabbed it and moved it. The Apple designers also invented the menu bar, the pull-down menu, and the trash can—all features that radically simplified the original Xerox parc idea.**


&gt; **The difference between direct and indirect manipulation—between three buttons and one button, three hundred dollars and fifteen dollars, and a roller ball supported by ball bearings and a free-rolling ball—is not trivial. It is the difference between something intended for experts, which is what Xerox parc had in mind, and something that’s appropriate for a mass audience, which is what Apple had in mind. parc was building a personal computer. Apple wanted to build a popular computer.**


As you can see, that thoroughly debunks the myth that Apple's idea were stolen from Xerox.",87,89,2011-10-24,AAPL,0.05462896637618542,0.9018049538135529,0.04356612637639046

apple,Opinions on Steve Jobs' biography.,"So far (I'm halfway through), I'm enjoying it immensely. Here's some thing I've learned about Steve:


1) he's at the very least emotionally unstable, much more so than previous accounts have suggested. I'd go as far as to say he is slightly manic-depressive (I have a psychology minor so I feel 50% justified in saying so)

2) one of the most brilliant manipulators/marketers/cosmeticians of our time, but he had little to do with actual engineering

3) his arrogance and egotism directly contributed to the amazing design of the products we all use and love today

4) he believed in some truly crazy pseudo-religious stuff throughout his entire life, i.e. he used to never wear shoes or deodorant because he thought his vegan diet killed B.O. (It didn't)


I'm thankful for his contributions to the technology world. He's a brilliant person. This book conveys an extremely honest image of him. I'd recommend reading it. 


And before I'm accused of being an Android fanboy, I own an iPad, Macbook Pro, and iPhone, and I've worked a stint at Apple before. :)",103,70,2011-10-24,AAPL,0.02597063221037388,0.9273368716239929,0.04669244587421417
mac,"Long Time Windows/PC Fanboy, Finally Gave In (Not by choice!)","I've been a PC/Windows fanboy for the longest time - I've grown up my entire life with a huge fascination in the realm of computing, and I'm an avid gamer/novice programmer. While I've never 'hated' Apple (after all, I do have an iPhone 4...), I always felt as though their products were outrageously priced as a result of stereotypes/branding. 

Well, this past week I was awarded a scholarship (I'm a senior in high school). The scholarship was for $10,000 towards college - that being said, the scholarship committee 'decided' to throw in a 2011 Macbook Air. The scholarship itself was a more than welcome surprise, but the additional Mac topped it off.

After the excitement of the surprise died down, I decided to try out the Mac. It turned out it was the base-model (64 gb HD/2 gb ram/i5) of the newest edition MBA - I was/am happy enough with being given a computer, so the lower specs didn't bother me at all.

My initial experience(s) with the Mac have been great. OSX Lion is phenomenal - the intuitiveness of its design as well as the user-friendliness has made learning it a breeze. Additionally, everything seemed to run fluidly on the Mac and its power/speed was much greater than I previously expected. While I LOVE both the build quality and OS of the Mac, I just finished installing Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit on the MBA using a separate partition. I plan on using both OSs to suit my needs, as I find them both to be wonderful. Also, my experience with installing Windows on it was easier than I could have imagined - Boot Camp allowed me to instantly mount my Windows Iso onto a flash drive and boot right from there. It also supplied me with all of the necessary fixes that made the Mac much more compatible/usable with Windows.

TL;DR: I, a longtime Windows/PC lover, was recently given a Mac and I cannot help but admit that it is absolutely wonderful. While I still think that Apple's pricing is unnecessarily high, I can honestly say that the OS and the build quality are top notch and I now understand why so many people love them. I am now a happy Mac/PC hybrid user, and love both for their respective qualities.

Long live Mac/PC! :D",28,33,2011-10-24,AAPL,0.03077118843793869,0.9238453507423401,0.04538344964385033

Yet, I am really bothered by the fact that I have to go 4 levels deep into iOS settings to turn bluetooth on or off.  The same thing goes for WiFi, launching apps, posting Facebook statuses, Tweeting, etc.

Why would they go to such lengths to integrate voice recognition if we still have to do so much manually?  It just seems silly to me.  I understand that Siri is still ""beta"" (as Apple calls it).  It is a work in progress, I get that.  It just seems like it would be much more effective and USEFUL if it allowed us to give it such commands.  The voice recognition in my Acura TL seems more robust than Siri and that technology has been in use for years.  I can turn on my radio, climate control, make phone calls, read messages, change the radio input, stations, etc.

Sorry for ranting here but it just feels like it was rushed and lacks basic features.

iphone,Just a little warning about sending mass texts with iMessage.,"Every Friday morning I send a mass text to my friends that includes a picture of Rebecca Black, mostly because they all hate her with a passion.  Well, one of my friends who recently bought the 4s texted me back, and he and I started talking.

First tip, if you send a friend a mass-text who has iMessage and you have iMessage, the friend can see a list of everyone you texted at the top of the text.  And if they don't notice, and reply back to you, they'll send a data text back to your iMessage and everyone else whether or not the other recipients have an iPhone or not.  He didn't notice, and I didn't notice either, because typically when I received a reply from a mass text before iOS 5, it appeared as a separate text from the mass text.  He and I sent about 12 texts back and forth and everyone received them all.  One of the friends with an older phone called me up and told me he keeps receiving data files with my number, someone elses number, and our texts we sent back and forth to each other.  That's when the lightbulb lit up for me, and I realized what just happened.

TL;DR If you send a mass text with iOS5 to a group of people and one of them has iOS5 as well, they'll see a list of everyone you texted.  Don't carry on a conversation with them in the mass text.

iphone,"My iPhone was stolen, and I got it back with iCloud! Now I need some assistance....","**TL;DR- I need help getting location information off my phone with iOS 5, my mac is running on lion.**

So earlier last week I was doing volunteer work, and put my phone down. Needless to say, I was thoughtless, and the phone was gone by the time I went to look for it. I went to my office, and checked on the phone with iCloud. The phone was driving down a road far away. 

I still assumed a child must have picked the phone up, so I sent a message ""I think your kid might have picked this phone up. Please call 555-555-5555 to let me know you are returning it.""

The car was headed towards my office, so I thought the parents had found the phone and was coming back. When the car started heading somewhere else I called the cops. 

The police were wonderful, one cop came to meet with me, the other went to where I told them the phone was. He found a lady with kids who claimed she wasn't at the event I was helping out with. She also denied having an iPhone on her. Then the cop told me to ping the phone. 

That must have been really awkward for her.

Anyways, she also lied about where she ""found"" the phone and when, so the cops asked me if I could get the location information from the phone. Is this possible? 

Thanks! 

Edit: Thanks for letting me know about the cellphone tower not being in use. People wanted to hear the rest of the story, so I posted it in the comments, but I'll put it up here with some more detail too. 

When the phone started ringing, it was in her purse. At that point she admitted the kid gave her the phone after they'd been to some kid's place downtown. My cop went with me back to the event, and we got confirmation from the guy working the door that he remembered seeing a woman and kids of her description. 

When the cop who was with me met up with them, he told her to cut the crap, and tell him the real story. She changed her story to ""Oh, I was at that event, but my kid took the phone. I took the phone from my kid to bring it back.""

Sure lady. That's why you lied about having it, and where you went that day. 

Anyways, the cops just wanted as much evidence as possible to make this easy. I feel like it's pretty obvious already that she took it, but it would have been nice to have the tracking data.

Edit 2:  I'm gonna stop giving details, just cause I'm not sure what would hinder the case in general. But I'll give you an update when this all gets settled!",59,106,2011-10-31,AAPL,0.05052535608410835,0.9195496439933777,0.029925024136900902
