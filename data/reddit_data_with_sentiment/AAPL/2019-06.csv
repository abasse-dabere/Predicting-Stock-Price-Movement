apple,Screen Time saved me from a cheating accusation.,"Okay this was actually my sister but she doesn‚Äôt have a Reddit so I‚Äôll just post for her. Also delete if not allowed. 

Yesterday my sister was accused of cheating on her test when she glanced at her phone to check the time because the clock in the room didn‚Äôt work. Of course the teacher caught her at the exact moment when her head was down. Long story short her teacher wanted to report her for cheating and put it down on her academic record which would‚Äôve been devastating to college prospects. My sister admits looking at her phone might not have been the smartest choice but she wanted to know the time to pace herself through the test. Anyways using the screen time feature my sister was able to prove she was not on any app between 2-4PM that would assist her on the test. The screen time not only showed time spent on safari but also the individual time spent on different websites which I think is a very neat feature. I just wanted to commend Apple for this great feature and it really saved my sister from a massive headache.",99,558,2019-06-01,AAPL,0.05238736793398857,0.9139552116394043,0.03365747630596161

apple,Why Apple‚Äôs products are expensive - a serious post,"Every time apple releases a new piece of hardware - the internet (especially Reddit) loses its mind.

It‚Äôs the exact same cycle every time. Every second post is a variation of these:

‚ÄúLMAO - Apple are just greedy now‚Äù
‚ÄúI can spec the exact same laptop/workstation much cheaper online‚Äù
‚ÄúSamsung/Huawei phones did this 1 year ago and are much cheaper‚Äù

And every time I cannot help myself and start explaining why this either false or why apple is indeed more expensive.

And every time I‚Äôm being dismissed as a shill or mindless drone. And yes - I know it. The typical reddit user is not Apple‚Äôs typical user. It‚Äôs like walking into a conservative political meeting and start preaching communism. You will get boo‚Äôed out.

It exploded again yesterday when apple introduced a 6K computer with 256gb SSD and a 5K monitor with a 1K stand.

Again I started arguing that this is for pro users and not consumers and again I‚Äôm being called a shill and fanboy.

But this has nothing to do with fanboyism. The pro community was screaming for a modular and user upgradable workstation. Apple just delivered that. 

This is where the cycle starts. It‚Äôs now that people looks at specs and starts comparing on the web. What you don‚Äôt seem to realize is that apple is not like any of the other hardware makers. Apple don‚Äôt buy any oem parts except cpu, gpu, ram and storage. They design the rest from the ground up.

The case, the double sided motherboard, the entire cooling system and the crazy 1.5kw psu are designed by apple from scratch. What chassis would even be comparable to the (kinda hideous) Mac Pro ?

Anywho. Other hardware manufacturers do this too - no biggie. But what apple also do and which is the reason apple is the most valuable company in the world is they also make the software. This gives apple an advantage in that they don‚Äôt need bloated software that has to support thousands of different hardware setups and millions of 3rd party drivers and control-software. The result of this is a system which requires minimum maintenance and ensures maximum stability. 

This is why a lot of people (pros and consumers) ‚Äúoverpay‚Äù for the hardware. You have one system update, which includes all relevant drivers and you don‚Äôt risk having a badly made 3rd party driver which crashes your system every now and then. 

Jebus Christ. My 8700K gaming rig has separate drivers and pieces of software to control mouse, keyboard and headphones. How is that not a maintenance and stability nightmare? One or two times a month windows fails to recognize the usb dongle for my steelseries headset and I have to un- and replug it for it to work again. When I do this windows renames the headset unit to arctis7(x) where x is the number of times this have happened and I have to change this in the 3rd party sound switching (monitor speaker / headset) software. Yes - there is a 3rd party piece of software for when I want to change sound output.

And I don‚Äôt blame windows for this. It must be a nightmare to maintain an OS that has to support all this. 

But I don‚Äôt want to hassle with drivers and unrecognized devises when I boot up the computer at work every day. That shit just got to work. I can accept these things in my spare time and I do enjoy a good bug hunt and error finding every now and then - WHEN I‚ÄôM NOT on a tight deadline. :-)

If you watch the keynote from wwdc you will see the amount of resources Apple pours into software. All those developers aren‚Äôt free. 

This is why you can‚Äôt compare apple to Huawei . Apple doesn‚Äôt pay Microsoft 25 bucks and slaps on an OS or use android on their phones.

Apple‚Äôs computers, phones, iPads, watches and atvs has their own freaking OS developed in-house. These operating systems has features you cant get anywhere else. 

Just look at what apple are doing for consumers regarding privacy on iOS right now. That‚Äôs some next level shit. Yes - much of it can already be done if you‚Äôre just a little bit tech savvy. 

And this is where reddit and apple clashes - Apple rarely come up with original ideas - what they do is improve the shit out of great ideas so mainstream consumers get access to tech that was previously not available to them because it was too complicated. Apple has always done this. Look at the iPod or iMac. Nothing new - just easy to use. 

And the best part. The price of this software is included in the price of the hardware. You buy one device and get all the benefits. How can you include this in your price comparisons? How much does privacy cost? It cost more than no privacy for sure - but are you a sheep to subjectively value design, security and privacy a lot and be willing to pay more to have it? 

OH WAIT. There is another best part. If you don‚Äôt want to pay for all these conveniences you don‚Äôt have to. If the new Mac Pro is not worth it to you, buy Lenovo. I am not gonna call you an idiot for that. 

I don‚Äôt call people who buys an Audi over a Kia for stupid mindless drones, even though the specs look the same and Audi costs more. I know there is more to car purchases than mpg, mph and horsepower. There are things like design and software which has a subjective value too people. See where I‚Äôm going with this?

Or am I just a mindless apple sheep shilling my day away?


TLDR; Apple makes hardware AND software which gives a unique opportunity to ensure ease of use, minimum maintenance and maximum stability and security for the user. How do you value something like this spec comparisons?


EDIT:
Having read through all the comments I really wonder what it is about Apple that makes some people completely blow a casket and immediately resort to insults and throwing mud?

How would this work IRL? Do these good folks walk into a restaurant and start calling the other guests for idiots and mindless brainwashed sheep for paying $4 for a glass of Pepsi that can be bought for a fraction of the price at the supermarket next door? Or do they yell at them for buying a 30 dollar steak, which is literally $5 worth of cow‚Äôs muscle tissue that can be cooked at home in 10 cents worth of butter for 2 cents worth of electricity.

Or do they maybe know that sometimes you pay more than ingredients because there are chefs in the kitchen working to make a delicious meal and waiters serving the stuff and making sure your evening goes smooth and without hiccups and that these people needs to be paid a salary for providing you with a good customer experience?

Do they know that a 3 star restaurant serves the exact same Pepsi and cow as the more expensive 4 star restaurant?

Oh - and thanks for the platinum and gold. I appreciate the gesture, kind strangers. And even though you might have paid a couple of dollars for something that is literally only ones and zeros worth 0.00000001 cents of electricity on a server i will not hold this against you. Instead i will wish you and your loves ones a happy summer. :-)

apple,[OC] How Apple is managing OLED-like performance from the Pro Display XDR,"**Apple claims OLED-like and Reference-level performance out of their 10bit IPS Display. So how are they doing it?**

After some searching, I came across a [patent they filed in 2016](http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20160170702&amp;IDKey=20CD61FD97BF&amp;HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.html%2526r%3D1%2526p%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPG01%2526S1%3D%28345%25252F618.CCLS.%252BAND%252B20160616.PD.%29%2526OS%3D%2526RS%3D)

This is a fascinating patent, as it suggests Apple has made an entirely custom double-IPS panel. If you take a look at the  [cross section of the custom Apple panel](https://i.imgur.com/m4wOaOX.png), we see something *fascinating*. **There is a A SECOND IPS PANEL near the backlight, enabling significantly better ""light shaping"" by allowing them to significantly dim specific screen areas *at the pixel level* rather than solely relying on 526 microLED's for Full Array Local Dimming**. 

I'm also guessing that the back panel is actually a monochrome IPS display, finely tuned to filter out the blue wavelengths from, the Blue backlight Apple is using. They use blue LED's rather than white ones because you can achieve finer control of the light output based on voltage/current input, for better granular control). 

The patent also details [Apple's custom image processing stack](https://i.imgur.com/8feBhRL.png), showing how the incoming data is parsed and shipped off to the various layers of the display, in incredible detail!. It appears that Apple is splitting the image into two parts. The image designated for the ""back panel"" / Lighting is split into 3 parts -- a downsampled image so it can be processed quickly (this needs to be done 60 times / second). Then algorithms modify the frame slightly, based on how the backlight will shine through the rear panel, and produce an upsampled image. This information is used by the miniLED backlight for local dimming, and the *upsampled, modified frame* is sent to the *rear* IPS display for fine tuning the ""light shaping"", to assist the front panel. This enables the light to shine brighter on ""HDR regions"" of the screen, while eliminating backlight bleed for the dark areas, achieving very close to OLED black levels. 

Finally, the normal color image is sent to the ""front panel"". Thanks to the intermediate diffusers, polarizers, and more, the carefully aligned light going through the two sandwiched layers is combined, ending its journey when it meets your eyeballs. And now you now know the secret sauce for how Apple managed OLED-like performance. :D Both panels, as well as the miniLED backlight must be properly calibrated for this to work well. 

-----

It should be noted that this type of dual-layer screen is very hard to do without atrocious lighting, bloom, consistency, and color issues, as well as general image artifacting. It's been attempted, but [has only previously been commercially available with Medical Grade monochrome displays for Xray reading](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261050283_HDR_medical_display_based_on_dual_layer_LCD). It's really impressive that Apple managed to do It with a full color HDR display, and achieve reference levels of calibration on such a high density display. A company named HiSense also managed to do something similar in a TV (much lower pixel density) and [showed It off at CES 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STdZ_kiHYEY). Not sure it's on sale yet, though.

apple,I was banned from Apple Pay Cash for life... until the Feds stepped in.,"I have been on a rollercoaster of an adventure with Apple Pay Cash‚Äôs service. 

On Monday, May 13th, 2019, I had noticed my Apple Pay Cash card said my account has been restricted. The full message stated ""Sending and receiving money in Messages has been restricted. You can use your remaining balance in stores, in apps, and on the web."" The suggested response was to contact Apple to resolve this issue. I contacted Apple and spoke with a representative that closed my Apple Pay Cash account and allowed me to attempt to reopen the account and verify my identity. I proceeded to follow as the representative instructed. When we started to re- setup my Apple Pay Cash card, I was presented with a message saying ""Verification Failed. Your identity could not be verified. You can still use your Apple Pay Cash balance in stores, in apps, and on the web. Sending and receiving payments in Messages will not be available until the verification can be completed."" The representative told me she could not provide any answers as to why my account was restricted in the first place, gave me a case number and directed me to reach back out to Apple in two business days. After the two business days had passed, I had called Apple Pay Cash support back on May 15th, 2019, and they had told me I will be unable to use my account due to suspicious activity. I asked what suspicious activity and how I could counter this claim. The representative stated that she was not at liberty to say what suspicious activity occurred and that I would be unable to find this information. I asked to speak with her supervisor who reiterated the same thing. This advisor told me I would not be able to use Apple Pay Cash services anymore without providing any further information as to why. The supervisor said I had violated the Terms and Conditions in Section 1, subsection I. This did not provide me with a direct answer to why my account was restricted originally nor why I can no longer use Apple Pay Cash services. The Supervisor transferred me to a Senior Apple Pay Cash support specialist that was much sterner with me and told me that the process of identifying suspicious activity was a ""trade secret"", that I am barred from using Apple Pay Cash services, and to find a new service to use.

This above piece was the complaint I had submitted to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau on May 15th. They asked me to specify what would be a fair solution to this issue. I said that I would like specific information to why my account was restricted and the ability to use Apple Pay Cash services again.

On May 24th, I received an email saying they were forwarding my complaint to the Federal Reserve. Last week, around June 4th, I received a letter in the mail that my complaint was being handled by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything out of this at this point. I already migrated to using Google Pay for transferring money between friends and to cover my bills.

Today, June 11th, I received a private phone call. I normally don‚Äôt answer, but I did and it was a senior Apple Pay Cash Specialist. They told me they had received my complaint from the Federal Reserve (totally expected them to tell me to go away and stop bothering them). The rep notified me that they reactivated my account, issued me a $20 credit, and told me ‚Äúto go buy myself something nice for lunch‚Äù. They were insistent on saying that their systematic process was a trade secret and they still could not disclose to me why my account was blacklisted at all. I still do not feel confident in using this service and think it‚Äôs EXTREMELY sketchy that I had to go through this process with still a lack of information concerning my identity and finances. Think I want an Apple Credit Card? HA NO WAY. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact Apple Pay Cash was federally regulated (by GreenDot), I would‚Äôve never had my account reactivated. Just me or is this bothering anyone else?


#TL;DR:
Banned from Apple Pay Cash for a reason they wouldn‚Äôt tell, claimed I violated an obscure section in their terms and conditions. Elevated to senior support that told me they couldn‚Äôt tell me what suspicious activity I was doing, find another service, you‚Äôre barred for life. Filed a complaint with CFPB that sent it on to the Federal Reserve, who sent that on to Apple. Apple called me a month later saying my account was reactivated, here $20 ‚Äúfor a nice lunch‚Äù, and have a good day! Still didn‚Äôt tell me why they banned me.",307,1334,2019-06-11,AAPL,0.0982004702091217,0.8753681182861328,0.026431463658809662

apple,Clearing up misunderstandings and miscommunication about NFC in iOS 13,"Hi all,

I've been waiting since about 2012 for NFC to truly come to iPhone. I've been keeping an eye on the space, mostly focused on Android and transit, since that time. Now that NFC has finally arrived for iPhone, I thought it would be good to share some info on what NFC is, what devices it will work on, and what it will do for you. As for my background and why you can trust me? Other than my love of NFC long before most of you knew about it, I'm also a iOS developer. I built [Home Assistant Companion](https://apps.apple.com/app/home-assistant-open-source-home-automation/id1099568401) as well as my newest app, [TransitPal](https://github.com/robbiet480/TransitPal) which allows you to check the balance and details of, guess what, an NFC transit tag, such as the [Clipper card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_card). I've already deeply immersed myself all of the changes in [Core NFC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc) that are coming as part of iOS 13. I've also been pretty active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robbie) talking about iOS 13 and NFC.

# What is NFC?

NFC stands for Near-field communication. NFC powers a lot of things in our lives today. It's how Apple Pay in stores works. It's how your transit pass (e.g. Oyster, Metrocard, Clipper, etc) work. It's maybe how your badge is able to unlock doors in your home or office. Effectively, NFC is a way for one device to talk to another device and quickly exchange some information. As you most likely know if you already use NFC in your day to day life, the two items must be held pretty close together (but, common misconception, you do not need to _tap_ the items together in most cases. Apple even tells developers in the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/near-field-communication/) to never instruct users to tap). BTW, NFC is NOT the same as RFID. To put it simply, NFC is two way communication vs RFID which is one way. NFC is also newer.

# Does my iOS device have the NFC hardware built in?

If your device supports Apple Pay in a physical store, yes, your device has a NFC chip. That's the iPhone 6 and later. To be clear, iPad does not have the chip, nor does iPod touch.

# I've heard that iPhone XS/XS Max/XR support some special NFC features, such as ""background tag reading""? Why is Apple keeping those special features away from my fantastic iPhone X?!? Why doesn't Tim Apple love me??

That's right, there are some special NFC features that are only available to the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR. They are:

-	Background Tag Reading
-	Express Cards with power reserve

**Both of these features are only available on the XS and XR because of an actual _hardware_ change made in the A12 Bionic SoC**. Apple is **not** intentionally keeping functionality away from older devices that they could enable with software. There is no giant conspiracy to make you upgrade to the latest device (well, there might be, but it almost certainly isn't being driven by not letting you have the latest NFC features).

Details are a bit murky on what changed exactly (Apple doesn't really like to release full changelogs on the silicon itself, let alone the software running on it), but what appears to have happened is that Apple dedicated resources in the SoC to be able to leave the NFC hardware constantly engaged (or in ""reader/active mode""). This enabled faster response time when using Express Cards as well as the very handy power reserve feature. What's an express card or the power reserve feature? Glad you asked...

# What are ""Express Cards with power reserve""?

Let's break this term into two parts. First, Express Cards.

## Express Cards

Right now, there are only two kinds of Express Cards: [Student ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208965) and [transit](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209495) cards. Put simply, an Express Card is a standard pass in your Apple Wallet that has a special power: It can be (with your previous authorization) used without requiring you to authenticate via Touch ID or Face ID like you do for a Apple Pay transaction. Having to look at your phone to walk through a subway turnstile wouldn't be a great user experience, right? It takes too much time. Same goes for a student ID card being used to buy lunch or enter your dorm room. So an Express Card is exactly that, just an _express_ _card_. Please note, only some student ID and transit cards are supported, please click the links in the previous sentence to learn more.

## Power Reserve

Okay, Power Reserve is another simple thing to understand. If your transit card is on your phone and your phone dies, how do you get home? Power Reserve fixes this. Under very certain circumstances, your phone will allow you to use a Express Card after your iPhone dies due to battery depletion. Here are those certain circumstances:

-	The iPhone must have been unlocked using Face ID or Touch ID before it shutdown
-	It must be a system initiated shut down, e.g. you can't turn the phone off yourself
-	It has been 5 hours or less since the phone shut down (the exact timing is a bit questionable. Apple says 5 hours, but that's in a best case scenario. Everytime you use a Express Card in power reserve, the battery reserved for it will drop significantly.)

Assuming you meet all of these requirements, you can press the side button to get the standard ""plug me in"" screen as well as a note saying Express Card can be used. Just use it normally after tapping the side button. You'll feel a haptic when you do.

# What's background tag reading?

Background Tag Reading allows your iPhone XS (Max) or iPhone XR to constantly monitor for presence of a NFC enabled device/tag. If it detects one, and it's NDEF message contains a URI record, you will get a notification just like any other allowing you to open whatever the URI is. Most of the acceptable URIs are Apple system provided URL handlers. They are:

| URL Scheme               | Example                                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Website URL (HTTP/HTTPS) | `https://www.example.com`                                          |
| Email                    | `mailto:user@example.com`                                          |
| SMS                      | `sms:+14085551212`                                                 |
| Telephone                | `tel:+14085551212`                                                 |
| FaceTime                 | `facetime://user@example.com`                                      |
| FaceTime Audio           | `facetime-audio://user@example.com`                                |
| Maps                     | `http://maps.apple.com/?address=Apple%20Park,Cupertino,California` |
| HomeKit Accessory Setup  | `X-HM://12345`                                                     |

Outside of that, [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) are supported. A Universal Link allows a third party app to handle URLs for their domain. For example, the Apple Store app will be opened whenever you click a `https://apple.com` product URL. 

# I don't have an iPhone XS, XS Max or XR. How can I use NFC?

All iPhones starting from iPhone 7 support NFC (iPhone 6 and 6S have the required hardware but Apple somehow botched the implementation so it‚Äôs not usable to third parties). However, iOS doesn't constantly scan for tags on devices older than a XS, XS Max or XR. Therefore, the only way for you to use NFC is by using an app that initiates NFC reader mode. This is a manual process and the app must of course have support via Core NFC to start that reader mode. The app most likely won't do anything with presented NFC tags that don't contain the data its looking for.

# What's new in iOS 13 relating to NFC?

In iOS 12, Apple introduced [Core NFC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc) to allow apps to interact with NDEF formatted NFC tags. It was pretty limited as tags could only be read, not written, and only NDEF tags were supported. In iOS 13, that limitation was removed and Core NFC finally is pretty fully featured. Here's whats new:

-	Can read (and write) more than just NDEF tags
-	Can access the NFC tag unique identifier (UID), perfect to stop counterfeiting and identify individual tags
-	Shortcuts now offers NFC as an automation

# How does Shortcuts use NFC?

Shortcuts in iOS 13 lets you use NFC tags to kick off shortcuts. You simply scan a tag, most likely a NDEF formatted one, Shortcuts records the unique identifier (UID) of the tag and then when that tag is scanned in the future the shortcut runs. At least, that's how we think it will work. Not really sure yet due to bugs in Shortcuts relating to NFC. It _should_ be different than the iOS 12 way of using NFC with Shortcuts where you would write a NFC tag with a URL like `shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=My%20Cool%20Shortcut`.

# What does improved NFC support in iOS 13 allow me to do?

Well, it's early days of course, but there's already been some interesting developments:

-	[Japan has announced that they will enable the new Individual Number Cards (national ID cards) to be read via iOS](https://atadistance.net/2019/06/12/ios-13-nfc-for-japanese-individual-number-cards/)
-	[The official UK passport reading app that they are using to allow EU citizens to apply for citizenship post Brexit has announced iOS supports reading passports](https://readid.com/blog/ReadID-now-also-for-iOS)
-	A few weeks before WWDC, Apple announced they will be [enabling certain approved NFC tags to trigger Apple Pay to a company](https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1127949077432426496). For example, walk up to a parking meter, tap the tag, complete a Apple Pay transaction and you've just paid for parking without having to download an app.

I expect to see more third party app developers announcing their NFC plans in the coming weeks. A whole new category of apps that interact with the physical world is now possible thanks to Core NFC improvements, you should be really excited by the possibilities. Here's some non-Shortcuts ideas i've come up with on my own:

-	Your transit card is running low on funds. Use the official transit card app to reload funds to your card and finish the process by tapping your card.
-	Set up a bank account without having to visit a branch, just by tapping your passport or NFC enabled drivers license to your phone. The same thing for any number of confirmed identity required things like credit cards, utility accounts, taxes, etc.
-	Have trouble waking up in the morning? Put a NFC sticker on the other side of your room. Your alarm won't stop until your phone touches the tag.
-	Hate typing in long URLs for ads you see in the physical world? Just tap your phone to the ad and you can open the URL instantly.
-	Keep a NFC tag in your wallet as a digital business card. Anyone can tap it and be redirected to your website to connect with you.
-	Tap an NFC tag to connect to your friends wifi network automatically

Obviously when you add NFC and Shortcuts together the possibilities are pretty endless.

-	Put a tag on your bedside that you tap at night to automatically trigger a ""go to sleep"" shortcut.
-	A tag next to your TV which will automatically turn the TV on and open Netflix on your Apple TV... before you even can sit down

# What NFC tags should I buy?

NFC tags are super cheap and come in all shapes and sizes. You can get them as stickers, keychains, bracelets, rings and more. You can even buy custom tags with your logo on them and your data of choice already written to the tag! You can find tags on Amazon for about $10 for a pack of 10. If you're willing to wait, they can be had on AliExpress too. I've seen a pack of 10 for $1 before. Usually just searching ""nfc tag"" will find what you are looking for. A specific model I like (if you're willing to spend a few pennies more per tag) is the NTAG216. It's the fastest and largest (storage) tag that NXP, the largest company behind NFC, makes. The NTAG213 and 215 are also great tags. The other keyword to look for is ""NDEF"".

# Finale

In conclusion, NFC in iOS 13 is super awesome and will directly improve your daily life. It's coming soon, to a iPhone near you.

ipad,The iPad has quite seriously changed my daughter's life,"I've mentioned it in passing in a few threads - but my youngest child has fairly severe dyspraxia. Not so much in the stereotypical clumsy sense of the public imagination, but in the same way I strongly suspect I have it too - you can visibly see her mind blank out when it comes to how to instruct her body to do the next step of something. I get similar (obviously never knew what it was) when I'm writing things by hand - my mind totally blanks out which way to go to form the next part of a letter.

&amp;#x200B;

It's made the last year of school absolutely awful for her. We're in the UK and our curriculum these days has got blooming ridiculous - the writing demands even at age 5 and 6 have gone through the roof lately and there has been this gaping chasm opening up between what this very intelligent little child can understand, read and think, and what she can actually record on paper - you can see her struggling to remember how to form a letter and where to place words - and her self esteem has taken such a huge battering recently with this (we've not had the greatest year with teaching staff either).

&amp;#x200B;

Managed to persuade school to let us try a bit now we're near the end of the year of her using her iPad in class - and I have a different child coming out of school not in tears over how she feels her written work isn't as good as her peers... she's using Clicker Docs which is pricey but is a very solid primary age word processor package and you can turn predictive text on or off, add word banks to it, and it will read a sentence back in a child's voice after it's written, and Snaptype Pro where you can photograph a worksheet and tap and type anywhere on it... and she's coming home (as a fairly young 6 year old) and managing to print her work off from the day herself, export it as a PDF into a notes app to keep it saved (I love Clicker Docs but its file save features aren't the best for what we need) and the change is just dramatic. She can do things like record the sentence she's working on so it stays there for the time it takes her to write it (she has very poor working memory which is quite common with dyspraxia) and the other day they were doing a lesson where half the stopwatches in school weren't working (I'm a teacher myself - this is a ridiculously common state of affairs) so she was using her iPad for her group to time her!  


The other thing we've found is that she will write for hours using an apple pencil - with a silicone sleeve on it's nice and chunky for her to hold (but still ""cool"" unlike lots of pencil grips) and I think the fact she knows she can rub it out and re-do work helps her a lot. I've imported handwriting paper into goodnotes with the lower half of the letter space highlighted so she can see visually what size all her lower case letters should be and it's helped her dramatically - and of course she can zoom in and write in her normal quite large handwriting - but printed out at normal size it looks the same as everyone else's for her! There's also a load of handwriting apps out there - which when you use them with an apple pencil actually have helped this kid with a massive motor planning skills problem begin to form letters correctly and join some of them up. Unfortunately voice dictation software as of yet isn't the solution for us as she also has verbal dyspraxia (apraxia if you're in the US) so her speech is badly affected.  


Just thought I'd throw a different ""how I use my iPad"" tale in there - she's quite a young 6 years old. All with a basic 2018 ipad, cheapo case and screen protector and she's got a cheap bluetooth keyboard I wrote the lower case alphabet on with a sharpie that she keeps in school but I don't think she uses it much and just uses the on-screen one (we have a lower-case keyboard installed on it but she tends to use either the in-built Clicker Docs one which has the Sassoon Font on it, or the default Apple one most of the time)",35,587,2019-06-14,AAPL,0.0689040794968605,0.9045591354370117,0.026536813005805016

Edit:  It went from 1am to 1:24, and he groggily stopped it which was a complete relief.  But after 9 minutes it became clear that he only hit snooze and passed right back out.

My daughter and I had a family emergency, and couldn‚Äôt get a last minute flight. It‚Äôs an midnight to eight a.m. trip, and the bus driver asked that people please use their headphones so others can sleep, but people laughed and I can hear at least five different conflicting beats and rap playing right now loudly out of peoples phones from , so it‚Äôs just noise.

apple,My Apple Watch saved my life.,"Please bear with me as I am new to Reddit but thought it may be the best place to say thanks to Apple.

Dear Apple.

I thought I would take the time to write to you about my recent events and to let you know that I am thankful for your efforts in developing technology as it has saved my life.

I am a 30 year old male living in the UK, living a healthy lifestyle and although knew of some issues with my history of my health thought I was at the time the healthiest I have ever been.

Back in April while nearing the end of training for the Brighton marathon and feeling like I was doing pretty well. When on the 5th of April I was getting palpitations all of a sudden which didn‚Äôt seem to stop. While wearing my Apple Watch series 4 which had just had the ECG function just released a week before i thought I would use it just to see what was happen when it flagged up with an atrial fibrillation warning it made me more concerned with what was happening.

With a series of events which ended up with me in accident and emergency that evening to being told that I shouldn‚Äôt do the marathon which was only 10 days away just on a precaution to now 2 and a half months later after a series of tests being told I need to have a valve repair surgery via open heart surgery sooner rather than later which is currently booked for Wednesday 3rd of July.

I would like to take this time to thank the Doctors and Nurses who have got me to this position where after a recovery period will be able to live a healthy long life.

But I do know that without my series 4 watch just giving me a little kick to get to A&amp;E I may not be here today as I would have done everything to run that marathon which most likely would have killed me let alone ignoring the symptoms to the point of heart failure (blokes I know).

So thank you again for all your hard work.

Many thanks,

Phil Harrison  


Update 1: Firstly I wanted to thank everyone for their kind messages of support. 

After being prompted to email Tim Cook he has responded with the following email which I am very thankful for. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Phil,

I‚Äôm so glad you sought medical attention and you‚Äôre on the road to recovery. ¬†

Thanks for your note and kind words‚Äî‚Äîyour story inspires us to keep pushing forward.

Best,

Tim""

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully after this weekend I should have some more information about my situation after a pre-assessment and meeting with the surgeon.   


Thanks again.

Update 2:

Hey everyone, short update as I am currently in hospital the night before my operation. All will be fine and I will update this post when I can which will most likely be Friday. 

On other news I had a telephone call from the Apple Watch PR team which was really great how they wanted to hear about my story and wished me the best to get well. 

Thanks for following on from the original post and hope I will be able to post an update shortly with good news!

Update 3:

So my surgery was on Wednesday 3rd at 3pm. Everything went as planned and the surgeon was very happy. 

Recovery has been decent too, of course there is a lot of pain which is to be expected but at the end of the day I will be able to live a long and happy life because of this. 

Should be in hospital for another 2 - 3 days before they left me out and hopefully then just another 5 weeks recovery before I am all fine which is great timing because me and my partner get married in 6 weeks time. 

Probably the last update for a while, but thanks for following and for all the kind messages. 

Cheers,
Phil",228,2621,2019-06-25,AAPL,0.042867474257946014,0.9159078598022461,0.04122461751103401

The scariest part was I was completely unconscious. And my vision was blurry after I regained consciousness. I‚Äôm only 19 and work for Deliveroo, but I had no idea what was going on. Thanks to my Apple Watch and its medical ID, the people that found me were able to call my mother, see my name and weight and blood type and my history of other ailments, speeding up the process and letting my mum actually know. Again I was unconscious, I had no idea how she even got there when I woke up. I am just so glad I had it on. 

Thank you Apple for making it such a health conscious device, that massively sped up the process of getting my emergency contact and helping the paramedics.



Edit: Now this has gotten fairly popular I wanted to put this in.


**PLEASE** Put in your medical ID. I‚Äôve seen many people put theirs in because of my story and I really hope that anyone who see‚Äôs this in the future does the same!
