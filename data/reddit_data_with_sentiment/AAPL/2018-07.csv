apple,"Apple advertises the iPad as being a computer replacement, and yet, if I forget my passcode, it requires a computer to reset.","Per Apple, if you have forgotten the passcode necessary to log in to your iPad, you must connect the device to a computer running iTunes.

https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204306

&gt;Connect your iOS device to your computer and open iTunes. If you don't have a computer, borrow one from a friend, or go to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider. 

This seems like a rather significant oversight on Apple's part, particularly when the company has recommended the iPad as a replacement for a computer.

For example:

Assume you are on a business trip, and bring your iPad with you. You stay in a hotel that has Wi-Fi, but you've never connected to it before. You recently changed your passcode to log in on your iPad, but have forgotten it. Without access to a computer, there is nothing you can do. 

Working in an environment where I work with iPads daily, imagine how ridiculous it must seem to have to explain to someone that they have to have access to a computer to reset a forgotten passcode. It's insane to me that this capability isn't available without the need for a computer.

-----

**EDIT:** I know erasing via Find My iPad exists, but for it to work, you have to have a Wi-Fi connection, which may not be an option if you can't unlock the iPad to connect. Additionally, this is not what Apple recommends.

**EDIT 2:** I think the best solution would be the ability for the iPad to remotely boot to an Internet-based version of iOS, [like macOS Internet Recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201314) mode. This would enable the ability to restore an iPad without access to a computer. [See this screenshot](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/OS-X-Internet-Recovery-Mode-Mac-screenshot-002.jpg) for an example of what this looks like on macOS.

**EDIT 3:** It doesn't have to be limited to passcode issues. For instance, on the Mac, if macOS is experiencing an issue, you can reinstall macOS from the recovery partition OR via Apple's Internet Recovery servers. On iOS, however, if you need to reinstall the software, you have to connect to a computer and do so via iTunes. Wouldn't it be nice if iOS had the same Internet Recovery functionality as macOS so you could troubleshoot your device without the need to have to use a computer? Particularly when Apple is positioning the iPad as a device to replace computers?",801,7754,2018-07-01,AAPL,0.06368272006511688,0.9092006683349609,0.027116652578115463

apple,Why iOS will never replace my Mac,"So a friend gave me an audiobook in mp3 format that I wanted to listen to on my iPhone/iPad. Fine I thought, I'll just upload it to iCloud drive and play it in iBooks (Music has no progress, this audiobook is 12 hours)

OK, iBooks can't open the mp3 files from iCloud Drive. Fair enough. I'm used to weird random limitations on Apple software.

Apparently you can sync audiobooks via iTunes. OK, drag mp3 files into iTunes on my Mac, connect my iPhone via USB-A to USB-C dongle, done. Not quite, my iPhone is already synced with my other MacBook, so it will delete my whole music library. No-go.

OK, plan B, let's try some audiobook apps from the App Store. Download 4 of them that could to iCloud Drive sync.

1 app kept displaying ads I couldn't close, next.

Another app could only transfer a single file via iCloud drive at a time, and the transfer was via Internet, so it was really slow (400 MB audiobook in total)

Another app provided an in-app web server I could connect to via my MacBook, tried that. Could also only handle 1 file at a time, no go. After 1 file, it would disconnect.

Another app also had a web server, and accepted a zip file, so I had to compress the files and upload them. But the tracks were in the wrong order. Fuck that, don't want to drag 40 files around. I want to listen NOW.

Few more free apps had similar problems...

In the end, I gave in and bought Bound for $4 (45 DKK), which worked, supported transferring multiple files at a time from iCloud drive and sorting worked.

All in all, about 45 minutes of effort and $4 spent just to listen to a SINGLE AUDIOBOOK and I'm ready to throw my iPhone at the fucking wall right now.

And I work as a software engineer! If I gave my mom a  USB stick with an audiobook and tell her to play it on her iPhone, she would never, ever make it.",128,283,2018-07-01,AAPL,0.06997814774513245,0.9050002098083496,0.025021608918905258

apple,Apple's HDR implementation on most iOS devices is broken. Here's why.,"I wanted to bring up an issue that I noticed with HDR implementation on the iPhone 8 Plus.

As you may know, Apple supports HDR on the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad Pro 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch (2nd generation). There's also the Apple TV 4K but that's irrelevant to this discussion. All the aforementioned iOS devices support both, HDR-10 as well as Dolby Vision. However, out of these, only the iPhone X has an HDR display, making it the only one of the bunch to support HDR in both, hardware and software. The rest of the mentioned devices only support HDR in software.

If you don't know about HDR, this might be a good time to look it up. The gist is that HDR content has a wider dynamic range and also wider color gamut. HDR displays need to be able to do both of those things and also have generally higher peak brightness level compared to standard displays, with 1000 nits being generally the recommended minimum for an ideal experience.

Now, the reason I only specified the iPhone 8 Plus in the first line is because that's the only one of the five supported devices currently in my possession. However, I'm pretty sure the implementation is identical on the other three devices, with the iPhone X having a different and hopefully a better implementation due to its HDR display.

What Apple does on these devices that only have HDR support in software and not hardware is announce them to all the apps that the device supports HDR. Then it manipulates the content make up for the limitations of the display and make it look like it's HDR. I have tested this with iTunes content as well as Netflix, as they are the only apps I know of on iOS that offer HDR content (both HDR-10 and Dolby Vision).

What I have noticed is that when HDR content is played on my iPhone 8 Plus, the video has significantly crushed shadow detail. The screen below a certain luminance level just turns black, rendering all the detail there invisible even at the highest brightness level. Some of the colors also look a bit weird and not exactly how they should look. The overall image just looks like someone turned the contrast and saturation dials way up.

To demonstrate this I played the same Jessica Jones S02E01 on both the iPhone 8 Plus and an iPhone 7 Plus. On the iPhone 8 Plus the video is playing in Dolby Vision while the 7 Plus gets the standard feed. The images are in the Imgur link below. In every image, the iPhone 8 Plus is ABOVE and the 7 Plus BELOW.

As you can see, the 8 Plus has significantly crushed shadow details in all the examples. And no, this is not due to the camera being used to shoot these images but it really is how it looks to the eye. For reference, the last screenshot is from the new David Letterman show on Netflix, which is not in HDR and thus looks identical on both devices.

I also have a Galaxy S9+ which has a proper HDR display but I have not included that in the photo comparison. Needless to say it has the best looking image out of all three devices. I assume that's probably how it looks on the iPhone X as well but that's just my assumption and I have no way to be sure.

So basically, there is a problem with how Apple renders HDR content on these devices with non HDR displays. I honestly don't understand why they enabled this feature in the software to begin with. Usually Apple is very good with display calibration and color management but this just comes across as poor judgment on the company's behalf. It's not better, it's not even similar, it's actually worse than watching it on an older device where the feature does not exist in software.

I hoped it would get fixed in subsequent iOS 11 updates but it didn't. I have no hope it would get fixed in iOS 12. It seems very deliberate for them to ""fix it"" even though they should. I just hope all iOS devices get a native HDR display in future so this wouldn't be a problem anymore.

***Update:*** *After further observation, I feel like the reason for the aforementioned issue is due to the way highlights are handled. HDR content generally has really high luminance values that often far exceed those of the displays they are played on. Because of this, display manufacturers have a choice in how they want to display the highlights (or the brightest portions of the frame). One way is to have a standard brightness level across the frame and risk the brightest bits from overexposing. The other is to reduce the brightness across the frame so that the brightest portions are within the display's limits. I think most manufacturers go for the latter, including Apple. I have noticed this on the S9+ as well, where the HDR image is a bit dark but when a bright object appears on screen it is searingly bright. However, because my iPhone 8 Plus does not have an OLED display or an LCD with local dimming, there isn't a huge degree of variance between the brightest and the darkest areas of the screen, which means we end up with a dim display without any of the bright highlights.*

*Until we get truly high luminance panels, preferably OLED or any other self illuminating variety, I think manufacturers should probably avoid going the HDR route.*",49,272,2018-07-04,AAPL,0.03972433693706989,0.9146986603736877,0.04557698220014572

Other people tried to ring their immediate family members from other services but being in an area with barely 4G speeds caused massive slowdowns for other services where FaceTime showed no slowdowns.

apple,Comparing the improved Maps with the existing Maps and Google Maps,"Even after the public has had access to Apple's improved Maps data in San Francisco with the release of the latest iOS 12 beta, I noticed a lack of posts or articles which compares the existing Maps data to the improved data or even with the current standard-bearer of Google Maps other than the few pictures included in the TechCrunch article, so I decided to make my own [comparison](https://imgur.com/a/3C1063b).

I selected several sites in and around San Francisco and took the screenshots on both Google Maps and the existing Maps from the Mac app before trying my best to fit the same zoom views on my iPad to avoid bias by selecting only areas where I knew there would be improvements, though because of the extra height (or reduced width, depending on your perspective) achieving the exact zoom views was not possible. In addition, the Maps app on the iPad running the latest iOS 12 beta would display more details when zoomed in further, whereas all the images of the existing Maps contains the full amount of detail possible, where zooming in further would not reveal any more detail.

While still in its public infancy, huge strides have already been made in creating the best mapping data for Maps, and this is especially visible in the rather insane amount of detail in parks, schools, and other institutional spaces that sometimes bests even Google's level of detail.",147,346,2018-07-07,AAPL,0.018906930461525917,0.9034340977668762,0.07765897363424301

apple,Found an iPhone X under water. How do I find the owner?,"So my cousin was up at The Potholes near Kirkwood, CA this past weekend. He found an iPhone X in a Otterbox case (none waterproof case) a few feet under water. He tried to turn the phone on and surprisingly the screen showed the battery dead icon. So he threw it in rice over night and then charged it. 

Phone turns on. Screen is a little bit screwed up but still works. There is condensation in the front camera and rear camera. It’s passcode locked but when we hooked it up to iTunes I can see the persons first name that is associated with the phone. It says “xxxxxxxx’s iPhone”. I don’t want to give the persons name incase they contact me they can identify it. 

The phone still has internet access. I can see on the home screen it is getting Facebook notifications. Siri is passcode locked too. No medical ID. When I trigger SOS there is no contacts associated with it. 

Anything I can do? I made a found post on Craigslist. Is my best bet to take the phone to the wireless carrier that it is associated with? Take it to an Apple store? I just want to find the owner in case they have irreplaceable photos on the phone.

We are leaving the phone on in case someone calls it. Any other ideas?

EDIT: if I popped the SIM from the lost phone into one of my iPhones and did - Settings, Phone, My Number - would it show the number associated with the SIM?

EDIT 2: Surprised by all the downvotes. I hope people on this sub don’t lose their phones in the future!

EDIT 3: Someone called the phone today July 9th. My cousin answered and explained to the person what happened. That person got in contact with the iPhone X owners Dad. Dad called my cousin but was running into a meeting. His daughter lost the phone hiking. They live in Alabama. He’s going to call back with her shipping info and we will be shipping the phone back.",279,1894,2018-07-08,AAPL,0.050298355519771576,0.9217047095298767,0.02799690142273903

apple,iOS 12 Downtime Feature is Very Helpful,"Hey everyone! I haven't seen anyone post about the downtime feature in iOS 12 yet. After watching the keynote, this was one of the features that stood out to me the most. I know there are probably a lot of you who, like me, go on your phone when you get in bed. You're on ig, snap, or whatever social media app you have and before you know it, it's 4 am and you have to be up for work in 3 hours. I set up my downtime feature to turn on at 11 pm and turn off at 7 am. It's honestly been a game changer. At 11 pm all unnecessary apps lock and only contacts that are set as favorite can bypass the do not disturb. You can set which apps you want to keep from locking in case you use some type of smart alarm app. If you try to use apps that are locked, it asks if you want it to lock up again in 15 minutes or just disable the lock for the rest of the night. Since activating the feature I have been sleeping like a baby. I get my full nights rest and now I'm waking up before my alarm even goes off. I just discovered bedtime mode on my iPhone last night and I think I'm going to start using that as my default alarm.

apple,Search in the iOS 12 Photos app is a HUGE improvement,"I haven't seen this mentioned, but the Search tab within Photos is a massive improvement in iOS 12.

I believe Apple briefly mentioned this in the keynote, but I didn't really try it out in the beta until a couple days ago, and I've gotta say, I'm extremely impressed.

1. It recognizes far more items. If you type in ""cat"" or ""bottle"" or whatever else you can think of, it pulls up far more results than before and it's a hell of a lot more accurate. It's clear that a lot of work was put into the object recognition and search algorithms.

2. The UX is excellent. When searching, it shows you the optional keywords at the top (complete with glyphs showing whether it's a general search, a map location etc...) and below that, it subdivides everything into categories. It has a section for Photos (complete with the total number of results), Moments, Albums, Memories, and Places. And they are subdivided into albums and have a 'See All' button to see more.

3. It all pops up with lightning speed. There's no delay on anything. The second I type in an object, place, person, or whatever else, I immediately see the results. It's so fast that when I first started using it, I wasn't sure if it had actually found photos based on the keyword I typed or whether it was just displaying the default albums. It's the former.

4. Also, the layout in the Albums tab is a big improvement. The horizontal scrolling and the fact that there's a Media Types section with lines rather than tiles - all feels like a better use of space.

All of this might seem like no big deal because searching for photos isn't exactly a new idea, but something about the way it's all laid out just feel '*right*'. You know how when something is designed well, it feels like there's a seamless connection between your brain and what the software is doing? That's the feeling I'm getting here. It just feels natural. It's the exact *opposite* of the feeling I get when I use the Music app, where I constantly feel like I'm fighting with the app. But the new Photos app is excellent in my opinion.",77,482,2018-07-09,AAPL,0.02272399701178074,0.9167129993438721,0.06056297942996025

The transition has been so smooth and easy I was afraid to move because the android can do more than iOS in some aspects , but I’ve figured out that for my needs the iPhone works . The battery is amazing doesn’t waste that much I’ll use 30/40% in a day .

Apps have more choices on iOS and a big screen :)

Hopefully I can stay with Apple for a long time if they keep on improving ..

apple,The Apple Store may let you refund your 2017 MBP for the 2018 if you purchased it within the last month.,"I just visited my local Apple Store, and I had bought a new MBP with touchbar literally a month ago to the day. 

I explained my situation and how I saw that they just released the new machines today along with the Beats deal and asked if they might have some mercy for me and let me exchange it for the new one or at least get free Beats. 

The guy I spoke to said he completely understood my situation and had been there himself, he let me refund my 2017 MBP completely on the spot without even a receipt and told me the cash will be back to me in 2-3 days, at which point I can reorder the new one from the education store for the same price I did before and get my Beats.

To those asking about this I figured I’d post a bit of a success story to give some people hope, and though every Apple Store may not be as kind as mine it’s at least worth a shot to try for many of you I’m assuming.

AppleWatch,My Story of How the Apple Watch Saved My Life - Trigger Warning,"Trigger Warning!!!

I’ve lurked here for a long time but have never posted but I figured this might be of interest to this sub. 

4 weeks ago, my fiancé left me very suddenly after 5 years together. Fun fact: I proposed 2 years ago with an Apple Watch since she said she’d prefer that over a traditional ring. She had just bought her wedding dress a week before and I was completely blindsided and devastated by her leaving me. To add to it, she left me for her boss, who left his wife for my fiancé. Over the course of a couple weeks I would also find out that she had cheated on me on multiple occasions throughout the relationship as well. Needless to say, I have had a very hard time dealing with all of this. 

On Saturday, July 7th I hit a low and attempted to hang myself. During the process of doing so I realized what I was doing and how terrible of a decision it actually was. My phone was across the room since I didn’t think I’d need it again but I had my Apple Watch on and I was thankfully able to use the SOS feature to call 911. Thankfully I was able to get enough hold on the floor on my top toes to remain conscious until the police arrived. Without my Apple Watch though, I know I wouldn’t be here today and for that my loved ones and I are so very grateful. 

I know these stories of people using the watch and being saved come out from time to time but I wanted to share my first hand experience with you all. 


TL;DR - Tried to commit suicide, saved by watch. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for the support! It truly means a lot and is nice to hear right now. I honestly wasn’t expecting this much attention to be paid to this post but I am so happy that I posted it.",72,998,2018-07-14,AAPL,0.04671671614050865,0.9021304845809937,0.05115288496017456

AppleWatch,Apple Watch S3 in salt water and pool (my experience),"Hello everyone! As you know, Apple Watch S3 waterproof even in salt water.So, I did my experiment: I was spending about 3 hours,10 days in a row, in sea and pool with my Apple Watch to tell you, how they are good in?

So,at first I should say,that I was using they with silicon band.I was afraid,that band can undo,but it’s OK!Even jumping in water (4 meters) couldn’t undo it! Incredible!Nothing happened with color of band.

What about aluminum case? It’s good,no scratches,damages or something related.

If we speaking about activity,I had used built-in workout app and WatchOS 5 beta 3.Distance and calories are recording right (but sometimes distance can be different. Inaccuracy about 10-20 meters). I think,it’s better to use another app to record swimming activity 

Salt and chlorine water caused no damage to Apple Watch at all (you should wash your Watch in regular water after swimming in sea,because salt can damage to waterproof layer)

Summing up,Apple Watch showed yourself good in sea and swimming pool.

P.S: My recommendation: please, use “Water lock” option,because screen thinking that water “touch” on it. It will be nothing worst if you forget to activate this before your swim,just recommended.

apple,I think apple is making a judgement error pricing the mpb the way it currently is.,"I love the Macbook Pro, and loved my 2011 workhorse. It could do everything, had that magical way of charging with magsafe, and was an all around joy to use: solid hardware, easy to understand software, the works. Not only that, it felt different from the other laptops out there. Nothing could charge like a macbook, and nothing felt as well built. 

When I went to go purchase the recent MBP, I was upset that it was so expensive, and not just the device, but the ancillary devices as well. $80 charger that doesn't even come with a cable? Docks with the necessary ports not being included with the computer? Just to have a ""home base"" charger and an ""on the go"" charger for the mpb costs about $100, and that's after blowing $2000 for the computer itself. 

I couldn't afford it, was forced to move to windows, and have been pleasantly surprised. Chargers are now $12, so I can buy multiple easily. Many Windows based laptops have ports still, and Windows is very friendly with other devices in terms of connecting wirelessly. The laptop was $800 cheaper, and while it hasn't been perfect, it has been more than reliable, and a blast to use. 

Often, the discussion around apple is how great their marketing is, but marketing only goes so far. At one point or another, most people just want a solid, fast laptop that gets along with the things in their lives, and Apple just outright isn't offering anything at a reasonable price point for those people or professionals (and people like myself that aren't professionals, but want to feel that way). 

The more apple pushes people to pay more for what is becoming an increasingly slim margin of difference in terms of hardware and OS experience, the more I sense that there will simply be fewer mpbs around, and that's a shame. What used to come off as the laptop for creative professionals is feeling increasingly like a luxury fashion statement, and I just don't like thinking of apple in that light.

apple,"Apple dropped the ball with MacBook Pro, Seriously.","For a year now, I’ve been waiting for Apple to refresh their MacBook lineup since Mac is the only laptops that I like and I use... I’d rather get a Mac Air than a high end Windows PC because I love macOS that much.

But now..

I cancelled my order for the 2018 MBP TouchBar (16GB RAM/i9/15”) following the numerous accounts of users having issues with it and now the whole throttling thing.

First of all, who would buy a MBP with i9 and 32GB RAM? A Pro. A causal user won’t get the i9 merely for web surfing and watching movies. 

What’s the point of having an i9 CPU Mac if it ends up throttling itself before its even pushed to its limit? That’s like having a Lamborghini that can only touch 150kmph for a few seconds and then throttle down to 65kmph again, and you need run a full lap with it.

How could possibly Apple make a move like that? 

First they don’t replace the faulty 2017 keyboards with 2018 ones, now they release a Mac which has all the power a Pro would need, but can’t use it for anything it is meant to be used for.

Then the whole USB-C port thing which began in 2016’s MBPs. That was a change which wasn’t required and was made just for the sake of it. 

It Speaks volumes about their quality and the direction they’re headed with the Mac. 

*With Apple I’ve come to expect a level of quality and performance unmatched in the industry, but not anymore, not at least this time. But then again, I’m not an expert to verify this and as a consumer, my assessment is based on the accounts of numerous reports in this sub and elsewhere. I’m hoping there is a possible software fix for this case.

apple,[Opinion] Apple painted themselves into a 'Thermal Corner' with the Macbook Pro just like they did with the Trashcan Mac Pro.,"A while back Daring Fireball did a very cool and very exclusive [""The Mac Pro Lives"" article](https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives) 

In it, there are some very interesting statements by Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller: 

**Federighi:**

&gt; I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. We designed a system with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture. That that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn’t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped.

&gt; Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate. So it became fairly difficult to adjust. At the same time, so many of our customers were moving to iMac that we saw a path to address many, many more of those that were finding themselves limited by a Mac Pro through next generation iMac. And really put a lot of our energy behind that.

**Schiller:**

&gt; As we’ve said, we made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others. Enough so that we need to take another path. One of the good things, hopefully, with Apple through the years has been a willingness to say when something isn’t quite what we wanted it to be, didn’t live up to expectations, to not be afraid to admit it and look for the next answer. 

-----------------

I'm willing to bet that Apple was hoping Intel's new CPU's were going to run cooler than they actually do. Unfortunately for everyone, Coffee Lake has higher power consumption than Kaby Lake... As seen in the very detailed section under this [NotebookCheck review](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-2018-Touch-Bar-i5-Laptop-Review.316648.0.html) Which talks about how Performance per watt is worse on Coffee Lake compared to Kaby Lake.

Generation|Architecture Name|Process|Model|Cores|Clock (Base-Turbo)|Max Power (tested)|Official TDP|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
8th Gen |Kaby Lake R |14nm+ |[i5-8250U](https://ark.intel.com/products/124967/Intel-Core-i5-8250U-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_40-GHz)| 4 cores| 1.6Ghz / 3.4Ghz | **41W** | 15W | 
8th Gen |Coffee Lake |14nm++ |[i5-8259U](https://ark.intel.com/products/135935/Intel-Core-i5-8259U-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz)| 4 cores| 2.3Ghz / 3.8Ghz | **51W** | 28W |

This table is a summary table of that section of their review. For those extra 0.4 Ghz, the chips have a 10W higher power consumption at peak performance. Performance per watt is down, and while these new chips have a microcode update for patching the spectre vulnerability, perhaps Intel had to bump up the clocks so this new chip didn't perform worse than the previous generation... (That's a guess for a likely reason for why we see these changes). 

Unfortunately history is repeating itself here - Apple left no thermal headroom on the MacBook Pro, and the extra power consumption, and resulting heat is just too much for these machines. This seems to be EXACTLY what happened with the Mac Pro (2013) which was tiny, but barely enough to manage thermals.  

This is of course made MUCH worse by [Apple's asinine fan curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgeh7ZJRhZU)

apple,What's In a TDP? Examining the Thermal Issues in the New MacBook Pro,"Buckle up, I'll try to keep this as technical as I can while also keeping it accessible to pretty much anyone who visits this sub and not rambling on for too long. To preface, this post is not meant in any way to be some sort of apology for Apple or to place any kind of blame on Intel. It is simply an objective analysis of the thermal performance of the 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pros in the current form factor released in 2016. I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering major (which isn't that much admittedly) with a lot of time today since its my day off work and I feel like writing something, so lets get to it.

Edit: This ran on longer than I wanted, so check the TL;DR at the bottom for a quick summary and then come back to look at specific sections if you want more details.


**The TDP**

Apple uses Intel's 15W and 28W mobile U-series CPUs in the 13-inch MacBook Pro and 45W CPUs in its 15-inch. It has done so for several generations, going back to at least the retina redesign. TDP stands for Thermal Design Power, and it is essentially an estimate of the average power in watts that a CPU dissipates under full load. This is actually a rather vague definition, because the amount of heat under full load can actually vary quite a bit based on the type of load itself, the temperature of the CPU, and the voltage supplied to it. The current official Intel definition can be found [here](https://ark.intel.com/products/126684/Intel-Core-i7-8700K-Processor-12M-Cache-up-to-4_70-GHz) and is as follows: 

&gt;	Thermal Design Power (TDP) represents the average power, in watts, the processor dissipates when operating at Base Frequency with all cores active under an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload. Refer to Datasheet for thermal solution requirements.

[Now take a look at what happens](https://imgur.com/a/cQxsDOI) when I run the default torture test in Prime95 for 5 minutes, with the fans manually set to maximum using Macs Fan Control on my 2015 MacBook Air with a 15W CPU. Notice that at the max boost clock of 2.5 Ghz and full CPU utilization the amount of power consumed by the CPU is around 15W, right where the TDP says it should be. The spike in the last few seconds of the test is due to a new test starting in Prime95, but since there is a decent amount of thermal headroom before the max operating temperature of 105 degrees I believe it would have stabilized again. Prime95 is in fact one of the most intensive CPU stress tests you can run, so if a cooling solution can handle its CPU under sustained load here it can do so with pretty much any load.

What matters here is that even under the most intensive pure CPU load I could throw at it, my MacBook’s cooling solution was enough and the 15W processor stayed basically within its TDP at full load and all-core boost. Even though Intel states that TDP applies to base clock speed, they typically had plenty of room to boost and still not go above TDP. The specific CPU in my MacBook is a Broadwell i5 5250U, the entry level SKU in a series that went up to the i7 5650U. If it were to run at 1.6 Ghz instead of its 2.5 Ghz boost I doubt it even would draw 10W. This result, that the entry level processor will hit its TDP at full load in something like Prime95 continued to hold all the way to Kaby Lake. [Here are several results](https://imgur.com/a/WnFF31m) in Prime95 taken from [Notebook Check](https://www.notebookcheck.net) where laptops using Kaby Lake H-series processors all ended up drawing around 45W while holding near the entry level i7 7700HQ’s all-core boost clock of 3.4 Ghz. At the i7 7700HQs base clock of 2.8 Ghz should draw only 30 to 35W of power.


**How Things Have Changed**

When Coffee Lake (and Kaby Lake R) launched, Intel’s U and H-series processors each gained two additional cores across the board. While base clocks were lowered in return, Intel’s specified boost clocks including the all-core boost clock shot up significantly. And yet, the Intel specified TDP for every processor in these series remained unchanged! This would suggest that the entry level i7 8750H (the successor to the 7700HQ) could potentially pull 45W or maybe just a bit more at its full 6-core load at the impressive all-core boost clock of 3.9 Ghz. **This is not even close to true.** [Here is an example of the i9 8950HK](https://imgur.com/a/YpZNHko) running at 3.8 Ghz, where it pulls not 45W but an absolutely insane 105W of power! Obviously no notebook designed around a 45W envelope would stand a chance at cooling such a beast at these clocks, only a massive gaming/workstation laptop would hope to do so at all.

Whereas previously the entry level processor had a tendency to hit the TDP for its class at full all-core load, the addition of more cores and even higher boost clocks at the exact same TDP means that this just plainly isn’t true. **We have finally come full circle to Intel’s official definition of TDP, which suggests a CPU will draw power equal to its TDP at full core load at its base clock speed.** Up until Coffee Lake this definition of TDP was basically an upper limit to how much heat a CPU could put out at base clocks, with most models not even coming close to hitting it until until well into boosting or even at max boost. But now with Coffee Lake Intel has gotten far more aggressive with its base clocks and boost clocks. Intel is now leaving very little room for any boost clocks at all before its CPUs hit TDP power usage and essentially exactly following its definition on the high tier models. So we should expect Intel’s 8th gen H-series CPUs to draw around 45W in Prime95 at full load at the 2.9 Ghz base clock speed of the top of the line i9 8950HK. [Here are several results](https://imgur.com/a/ZL94TxB) that back up this claim, where laptops with 6-core H-series tend to draw their rated 45W TDP at a clock speed of just around 2.8 to 3.0 Ghz which is exactly as expected based on Intel’s definition now that the are following it so closely.

**What This Means for the MacBook Pro**

For this section I will focus on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, as it uses the H-series processors we just discussed and has been under fire the most for throttling issues. [Looking at Prime95 stress tests and the reports from Notebook Check for both the 2016 and 2017 models](https://imgur.com/a/SIpTQnr), we can see that the cooling system is reportedly able to handle the all-core boost clock of their Skylake and Kaby Lake 4-core H-series CPUs. This makes sense, since just like my MacBook Air their cooling system is precisely engineered to dissipate their CPU’s manufacturer defined TDP and supports that the current design can dissipate up to about 50W of heat. However, now that TDP is much more strictly defined at the base clock instead, we should not be expecting the same result at all regarding boost clocks. Instead, the 2018 MacBook Pro should be able to hold its base clock speed of 2.9 Ghz with the i9 at full load where the CPU is producing the same 45W of heat. [Indeed, in a test where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoyWXjF1WWg) /u/Aea sets his fan speed to max and runs Prime95 the machine is able to successfully hold that speed while dissipating about 48W of power at a temperature of 94 degrees, a little below the CPU’s max operating temperature of 100 degrees.


**Thermal Throttling**

In the past, the consensus was that any drop below the processor’s max all-core boost clock would be considered thermal throttling, but a drop of a couple hundred Mhz under load could be overlooked as long as it didn’t fall below the base clock speed. This mindset was based on the old interpretation of Intel’s TDP definition, and leads us to believe that the new MacBook Pros should be able to hold their boost clock of nearly 4 Ghz or close to it under sustained load with the same cooling system even though they would actually be pulling around 100W of power. [An older 2016 or 2017 model that throttled to its base clock would end up pulling around 30 to 35W](https://imgur.com/a/KEZGRHQ), but when the current 2018 model throttles to the same power output [it will end up at clock speeds of around 2.0 to 2.3 Ghz](https://imgur.com/a/CxXH6is). 

Why Intel decided to change the way its base and boost clocks work is beyond me (although I can hazard a guess that it was in reaction to AMD’s recent success with Ryzen), but the end result is that a processor that can hold its base clock or a little higher is still not throttling and even a slight drop should be overlooked if we keep the same mindset as before. Throttling should only really be considered an issue if the system can’t maintain within a few hundred Mhz of its base clock in an intensive, pure CPU load such as Prime95. Going back to the test done by u/Aea, it appears the current MacBook Pros can do just that and should perform better than last gen models in heavily multi threaded workloads.


**Why Performance has Dropped**

Unfortunately, performance will not always be better as lots of results have shown in the media lately. For one thing, the new lower clock speeds at the CPU’s TDP mean that programs which depend more on single thread speed could suffer if the other cores are also being stressed in some way. The old i7 7700HQ running at 3.4 Ghz would be faster than the new i9 8950HK in such situations, even though in bursts of isolated single threaded loads the i9 should be noticeably faster thanks to those potentially higher boost clocks.

Perhaps the bigger reason why results are not as fast as last year’s model is that the new beefier CPU takes an even greater hit in mixed CPU and GPU loads such as in Adobe Premier. In the MacBook Pro, the CPU and dedicated GPU share the same 45W envelope. This means that any time the GPU is put under load the CPU will have no choice but to throttle back in order to keep temperatures under control. [Here is that mixed test using Prime95 and FurMark on the 2017 Pro](https://imgur.com/a/2fgzvZM) which results in the 7700HQ dropping down to just 2.4 Ghz and 26W while the GPU sits at 700 Mhz and 27W. The cooling system is able to work better with the more spread out load across two dies and process a larger 53W of heat, but the individual performance of each component is severely impacted. [For reference, an 8950HK should pull a similar amount of heat](https://imgur.com/a/2LY5INn) at clocks around 1.9 Ghz which lines up with reports of the processor dropping down close to 2.0 Ghz in certain loads.


**What Apple Can Do**

One quick fix Apple can do is make it so the fan speed ramps much more quickly than it does now. Before when the CPU went to its boost speed the CPU was only drawing 45W and so the cooling system had time to catch up, even though currently fans can take over a minute of sitting at 90+ degrees to hit full speed. But now hitting those boost clocks mean the CPU is potentially drawing around 90W of power, double that of what the cooling system is capable of handling at even full fan speed! Right now the processor throttles down hard after a few seconds, and then proceeds to rapidly spike and fall in clock speed while the fans slowly turn on. While obviously it won’t hold those high boost clocks no matter how fast the fan ramps, it could hold them for longer and hopefully reach a steady clock speed while pulling 45W sooner if Apple were to make the fans spin up much quicker.

This actually brings me to another point, which is that these new CPUs are facing a problem with settling in to a steady clock speed. Most reports on the throttling issues show that after the initial spike in clocks and heat, the clock speed then goes on to fluctuate wildly around its base clock or maybe a bit lower. For some reason the CPU keeps trying to draw way more than the system can handle by boosting and then it throttles hard right after. In other examples the CPU is running perfectly fine at its base clock speed, and then proceeds to throttle hard all the way down to even 800 Mhz when the CPU temp has barely even reached 80 or 90 degrees. Ideally, the CPU would let itself pull those 90W of power to attempt to complete quick burst loads, and then if the load continues after the CPU temp has shot up the fans would kick in to max and the CPU would throttle down to around its base clock where it would hold steady and draw a manageable 45W of power.

Edit: It has been brought to my attention that the throttling that results in extreme spikes in frequency down to 800 Mhz is most likely VRM throttling. With how much power these CPUs compared to their rated TDPs its honestly not too surprising that the VRMs would struggle to supply that much power.


**TL;DR**

With Kaby Lake and all generations before it, Intel’s CPUs ran below TDP by a wide margin at base clocks and had room to boost and still stay below that TDP. However, when two more cores were added and boost clocks were raised with Coffee Lake the TDP much more strictly applies to the CPUs base clock speed while boost clock speeds blow past it. The current MacBook Pro chassis has been shown to be capable of dissipating around up to 50W of heat, meaning that while the 2016 and 2017 models can hold their boost clocks at full load the new 2018 model will only be able to hold its base clock speed where its CPU produces the same 50W as last years model. Any throttling on the older models would bring the CPU clock speed down to around its base clock, but the same amount of throttling now brings clock speeds noticeably lower than the base clock instead. 

While the old CPUs could only produce up to 45W at full boost clocks, the Coffee Lake chips will now draw up to 100W at their own. This amount of power is far beyond what the MacBook Pro was designed for, and will only reasonably be held for a short amount of time before the temperature spikes way up, at which point the CPU should throttle back down to its base clock speed where it produces 45W and the cooling system can keep the clock speed steady. However, the fans in Macs take notoriously long to ramp up so this does not happen and clock speeds tend to rapidly spike up and down without much control right now. Additionally, in loads where the CPU and GPU must work at the same time clock speeds fall even more than before thanks to those two extra cores and performance may drop below the old levels.

Edit: Its been pointed out to me that I make it sound like Intel changed the definition of what TDP is but that wasn’t my intention at all. It is Intel’s interpretation of their definition that has changed, as they now take it pretty much literally. Intel has always stated that the TDP applied specifically to the base clock, but in Kaby Lake and earlier and especially on entry level models Intel CPUs output far below TDP at base clocks such that boost clocks were a better representation of TDP. What I meant to express is that Intel’s boost clocks used to hold at least somewhat close to TDP or even right at it if its an entry level processor like the i7 7700HQ, but now boost clocks just blow past it completely starting with Coffee Lake. I’ve made some small changes to make this more clear.",159,704,2018-07-19,AAPL,0.0691627012565732,0.8966979384422302,0.03413938079029322

apple,Lost Mode is Amazing!,"Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/EiQadqT.jpg 

So I went on my first ever business trip from San Diego California to Little Rock Arkansas. I had a connecting flight and so when I left the first plane and boarded my second connecting flight, I realized right when the plane doors shut that I left my work phone in the seat pocket in front of me....

I got so nervous and felt like crap that right when I got hired and was given the opportunity to travel, I lost my work phone already. I opened up a lost &amp; found report with Southwest and put my phone into lost mode with contact information as it was offline at the time. I also sent it a couple of pending beeps for it to play out loud the minute it gets signal again as it was on silent and was hoping it would grab somebody's attention. 

7-8 hours later, it FINALLY gets a signal and my email alerts me of its location. Then about 15 minutes later after I get the good news sent from iCloud to my email that my phone has been found, I get a call from a passenger telling me they found my phone and will turn it into Southwest baggage claim in Manchester, New Hampshire. From there, the Southwest rep was super friendly and helped me get it shipped back to San Diego with FedEx express overnight delivery. While it has been staying on lost mode the whole time, I was able to track the phone flying literally all across the nation going back to my home quicker than my itinerary. It was so interesting to watch my phone traveling all across the nation and was amazed with the battery life as well since I haven't had it for almost 3 days! 

I can safely say that Lost Mode totally saved my butt here for this trip and if it weren't for the sounds pinging on my phone and showing contact information, nobody would have been able to really help me out and it probably would have been piled up at a lost and found or who knows ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",116,1132,2018-07-20,AAPL,0.07928922027349472,0.8847296237945557,0.03598117083311081

apple,Useful tip for anyone who has a friend or family member who starts recording video vertically before rotating their phone resulting in one of those horrendous sideways-vertical video monstrosities...,"...I hope the title makes sense. 

My mum does this all the time and, because iOS doesn’t allow you to change the orientation of a video in the stock photos app (I’m not sure why, it lets you do it for photos...), the way I’ve fixed this in the past is to open iMovie, create a new movie, import the video I want to fix, change the orientation using the ‘twist’ gesture, export the video to camera roll. 

This works fine but it takes a while and you end up with a new video which goes to the bottom of your camera roll meaning it’s out of sequence plus you have to delete the old video manually, not ideal. 

Anyway, I figured out today that you can just edit the video in the stock photos app, click the ‘more’ button and select iMovie from the options. This opens the iMovie ‘extension’ (still in the photos app) allowing you to use the ‘twist’ gesture and save. That’s it. The video is rotated and saved right back where it was. No new video is created and there’s no need to delete the old one either. Really straightforward. 

I’ll guess a number of you probably know about this or some other way but for those that don’t, it’s quite handy if you find yourself in a similar position to what I often do.",85,523,2018-07-21,AAPL,0.024278748780488968,0.9173194169998169,0.058401886373758316
apple,95% of my computing work can be done on my iPad Pro.,"It’s just that annoying 5% that’s really frustrating. I’m studying Maths and Physics at university, and they require access to Matlab and RStudio.

Apart from that, I’ve been sailing along nicely using just my iPad. All my reports are done in Word or Pages, I hand write all my notes in Notability, and I organise all my assignments and documents in PDF Expert. 

With all the hoohah regarding the MacBook Pro throttling going on, it’s made me appreciate how utterly fantastic the iPad is. I just wish I could use it for everything. 

Who else is in a similar boat? I’d be interested to hear some other stories/perspectives. 

EDIT:

I just wanted to clarify my situation to provide a little context. 

I am indeed a first year student like someone wondered below, so I fully realise that my workflow is going to be much different as I progress. 

This whole “iPad-as-main-computer” thing is actually a bit of a personal experiment. About a year ago, my MacBook Pro was stolen, and I didn’t have the money to replace it at the time. It  happened to coincide with Apple really kicking off their iPad campaign, so I decided to give it a go. 

Now I *obviously* know my daily usage is very, very different to many of you down below. 
I seem to have ruffled a few feathers; I’m not so naïve to assume that my approach will work for proper professionals. But that’s not the audience the iPad Pro is aimed at, I think.

However it suits me *at the moment*, and probably many other people who have simple workflows that can easily change and adapt and don’t need to adhere to certain programs. 

I will be getting a Mac in the near future anyway, as I plan to change my Physics major to Computer Science, which naturally requires a proper computer.

Check out my TouchBar screenshots with the preset file. Enjoy. I uploaded the Application Support Folder &amp; the .plist file. Copy **BetterTouchTool** Folder to **\~/Library/Application Support/** then **.plist** to **\~/Library/Preferences/**

Edit: For those having issues

Make sure you are coping the files into the correct Library Path. You can access this folder by clicking the Go on the menu bar and holding down the Option Key. You will see Library appear and click that. It will open the Folder and in there you will find “Application Support” and “Preferences” 

Thanks **@AthleticSuppporter**

Open BTT &gt; Click TouchBar &gt; Click on General TouchBar Settings (which is right below the ""TouchBar"" you just clicked on).

On the new menu, click the first check box (Enable TouchBar Support) and make sure the second box is unchecked (Show MacOS Control Strip). Then restart BTT.

If you change your number and reset your apple device to factory settings. You won't be able to access your device because you don't have access to the number you set up with 2 factor.

You won't be able to access you Icloud.

apple,A year later after release and I still love the 10.5 inch iPad Pro.,"I got mine only a couple of months ago, and I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Yes I know there’s a new one (most likely) releasing in a few months, but I was complicit in wanting to retain use of the home button for the iPad.

I feel that 10.5 inches is just the perfect screen size. It’s really amazing how once you just get used to that size, 9.7inch iPads suddenly look quite smaller and not as appetising.  The Promotion just makes for such a fluid and seamless experience.

No one talks about this much, but one of my favourite things about this iPad is the brighter screen (600 nits), compared to its predecessor. As someone that uses mine outdoors a lot, especially during these summer days, it makes a huge, huge difference. And while we’re at it, outdoors, playing music on it through the stereo speakers (if I’m sitting in my garden eg) sounds amazing too. 

As a passionate Apple boy, I use Apples leathers sleeve, Smart Cover and Apple Pencil, and couldn’t be happier with all three. 

The 10.5 inch iPad Pro really will be fondly remembered by me as one of my favourite Apple devices ever released :) It will remain a solid device and relevant well into the future.",258,646,2018-07-26,AAPL,0.019612031057476997,0.9170529246330261,0.06333501636981964

apple,"PSA: The company behind the iOS Reddit beta survey that the mods posted on this subreddit had its data breached (Phone #, Email, Username). Consider deleting anything on your account you do not want publicly associated.","I know some people use multiple accounts and for some reason, this warning wasn't posted in the announcements section on Reddit. It's pretty serious and with people getting fired over 10 year old tweets, you may want to consider deleting portions of your account. Here is a copy paste of the message Reddit sent me.

We’re messaging you because your Reddit username was included in the responses that were downloaded. The surveys affected were all voluntary and included:

    A sign-up for the Reddit iOS app beta (Feb. 2016; ~6,600 responses)
    A survey about using Reddit via mobile apps (Sept. 2017; ~470 responses)
    A survey about the alpha version of the Reddit redesign (Sept. - Nov. 2017; ~510 responses)
    A survey about potential new posting features (Mar. - Apr. 2018; ~230 responses)
    A survey about Reddit Gold (May 2018; ~140 responses)

If you responded to any of those surveys, the information you submitted in the form may have been compromised -- including your email address if you provided one. If you did provide an email address as part of your survey response, consider whether there’s anything on this Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated publicly with that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this help page. And, as always, watch out for potential phishing scams or spam emails that might try to take advantage of any information you provided in response to the surveys.

apple,"Introducing Apple Music Player, an online web based Apple Music Player.","Hi, My name is Jonathan Dolbee and today I am releasing a very much beta version of my Apple Music Player application.

I have been developing this for about a month now so their very well may be bugs. If you'd like to report them to me here, that would be great. I plan on adding a huge list of features but for now lets talk about what features Apple Music Player currently supports:

## V0.0.1 Features:
 - Accessing and playing your entire Apple Music library
 - Queue functionality, if you click and hold on the items in the Up Next queue you can drag them up and down to adjust there position in the queue. You can also click the three ellipses icon next to a song item when you hover on it to play next.
 - Search through your library.
 - Album art gets a nice subtle glow to it, thats based off of the album art itself.	
 - A beautiful login page
 - Their is more that I probably missed, but the main point being is, its a functioning music player.


## Things To Come:

 - Repeat, and Shuffle functionality (For those of you who have to listen to Katy Perry on repeat)
 - Better design of the top title bar, adding things like how long the current songs will take to listen too, start listening to it shuffled, etc.
 - Giving users the ability to search Apple Music, instead of just their library.
 - Adding songs to, and removing songs from your Library.
 - Redesigned logout button, totally an afterthought
 - **And of course, any features you guys would like to see. Feel free to DM me**


## Accessing the site:
 
 So now onto the juicy stuff, how to access Apple Music Player?

**Simply visit https://www.music.redpoisonjb.com**
See edit-2 if youve already played a song on the old domain.

Thanks to Apple for their MusicKitJS library, and to Zachary Seguin for some much needed api call advice.
Also a special shoutout to a friend of mine who bugged me to release this.

Feeling generous, and want to buy me a cup of coffee?

## Screenshots:

## Known Bugs:

These are known bugs that I know of in this current moment. 
**Please keep in mind that all bugs could be an issue with the MusicKitJS library due to it being in beta.**

-	The play next dropdown can sometimes be cut off if you try to access it at the bottom of a scroll view. 
-	The play next button is lacking styling. 
-	Sometimes songs will fail to load, even though they have not timed out. 
-	Mobile support is horrible right now!

AppleWatch,"WatchOS 5 won’t support Series 0. Are you upgrading? If so, to what?","I bought my series 0 stainless steel watch on release day. I’ve been waiting for a meaningful refresh of the Apple Watch to upgrade, and year after year they’re just incremental upgrades so I’ve held back.

Now that watchOS 5 isn’t supporting series 0 (I’m actually surprised it’s been supported as long as it has been, frankly; it chugs), I’m planning to upgrade.

I’m hoping for series 4 to be announced this fall with a hardware redesign (similar size, bigger display with less bezels...that’s mostly what I want). 

If series 4 has that (I’m thinking it will as it helps explain why watchOS 5 is bringing WebViews to the watch now...to display content better, which benefits from the larger display area), I’ll be getting a stainless steel series 4 as an upgrade. 

If series 4 is more of the same, I’ll probably hold out another year. 😩

apple,"The Phone app could still be the killer app of the iPhone, if Apple can let it.","Steve Jobs once said that the killer app of the modern smartphone is the Phone app.\*  That being said, there are two fundamental issues that still prevent it from making that happen:

1.	**iOS's method of blocking calls in the Phone app and via CallKit needs to be completely revamped.** For starters, the native app has a rudimentary *Blocked Callers* list that is completely unorganized, not easily to manipulate, and worse, cannot be imported or exported. Sure, you can add every random number you get into a single ""spam"" contact, but even that in itself can get so unwieldy. So, when iOS 10 introduced the *CallKit* API, there was some hope, only to discover it's the equivalent of a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound with a chest rib protruding out of the skin. *CallKit* can block up to two million numbers per Phone app extension, so if you want to block just one entire area code, you'd have to have apps like [WideProtect](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wideprotect-spam-call-blocker/id1171024059?mt=8) has to add up to 15 extensions in order to block 30,000,000 phone numbers. A single incoming call or text would then have to parse through the entire list of databases before it comes through. [*CallKit* is already facing scrutiny for their implementation in China](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-bans-callkit-china/), though its reasons are still unclear. Oh, and do you want to know why *CallKit* has to utilize a local database system full of numbers that basically looks like a list from 000-000-0000 to 999-999-9999? It's because Apple's privacy laws are so stringent, the API will not allow an app to access the call history or utilize a internet/server-based query. That means no live, real-time caller identification and blocking.  
.  
What would really be a better solution? **Implement a whitelist feature: only allow certain calls to come through based on your contacts or a specific list of possible callers.** Is this a violation of FCC regulations? I don't think so, since [Android users can do it with many apps available on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.tn_software.callblocker&amp;hl=en_US). Who says that if you are given a ten-digit telephone number, it has to be reachable by anyone? Smartphones have made everyone more connected, *but maybe we're just too connected,* which is why these privacy measures have been set up. But, if you think about how social media accounts are available, you can create a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account and set it to private, to which an outsider would have to request to follow you. Why can't that be the same with a cellular number? If need be, they could even include a list of unblockable numbers like ""911"" or ""999.""  
.  
Flash back to February 2015 when rap singer Iggy Azalea placed an order at Papa John's. The delivery driver gave Iggy's personal cell phone number to his friend who was a fan, who then started spamming her with messages. [Iggy blasted Papa John's on Twitter over the lack of privacy and Papa John had to take action](https://mashable.com/2015/02/08/iggy-azalea-papa-johns-grammys/), with even T-Mobile getting in on the conversation when mentioned during the debacle unraveling on social media. All this would not have happened if either the phone, or its software, or the wireless carrier had implemented some sort of whitelist feature, as that overzealous (over-Azaleous?) fan was not in some big database of known telemarketers, spammers, or fraudsters.  
.  
Unwanted calls can be a thing of the past, if Apple could just let it. In fact, the entire telemarketing industry could finally be put in check with an implementation like this, since spammers and fraudsters don’t care about the FCC’s *Do Not Call* list, which is barely enforceable to begin with, and rarely makes telemarketing companies accountable as well.  
.
2.	**A single, unwanted, incoming call still completely destroys the user experience.** Over eleven years since the introduction of the iPhone, and this scenario is still, unbelievably, the same: You're in the middle of an app, or worse, recording an important event with your camera, and you get an incoming call. The Phone app not only takes focus, but it completely locks down your phone, and you can't get out until you choose either ""Answer"" or ""Decline,"" among other minor options like send a message to the caller or remind you to call back. If you hit ""Decline,"" it automatically sends the caller to voicemail, and the caller immediately knows they've been ignored or unwanted. All this results in two very unhappy people: the caller and the person called.  
.  
Two things desperately need to change here:  
.  
**a. stop locking down the entire device for that incoming call.** Allow the user to at least toggle back to the original app and finish up whatever they were in the middle of doing, to give the user additional time to decide if they still want that call, and  
.  
**b. allow the ""Decline"" button to dismiss the screen and let the user get back to the original app they were in,** ***but more importantly, let the incoming call still ring through to its normal timeout and eventually go into voicemail.*** This will possibly let the caller believe their call was just missed and not purposely ignored or unwanted.  
.  
Coupled with the first issue, if the caller is not in the whitelist or is an unknown caller, the Phone app could be instructed to play a secondary or generic voicemail greeting, where whitelisted callers would get the primary voicemail greeting.  
.

Others have argued that iOS' *Do Not Disturb* feature could be used to prevent unwanted incoming calls, but they easily forget that it also blocks all notifications from apps as well. *Do Not Disturb* could also therefore benefit from its own set of tweaks and revamps, where the whitelist could be implemented, and/or could be more robust to include a timer (i.e. block for an hour), geofencing (i.e. when entering a movie theater or exiting their place of work), and/or weekends (who actually handles their lives identically across all seven days of the week?).

I certainly believe that these changes are not too difficult to implement, and I've been asking Apple for years to make this happen. Maybe *CallKit* and *Do Not Disturb* were their first implementations to my request, but honestly, they're still both very basic and very naive. Let's be honest, when Apple debuted the original iPhone in 2007, it was touted as three amazing products in a single device. The Phone app really was the killer app of the iPhone. It got the positive laughter and applause it deserved the moment Steve Jobs mentioned it. But, with everything else in iOS getting more robust and more smart, Apple needs to really go back to that 1/3 of what made the iPhone so incredible, to take a new, bold look at this area, and address it much better this time around in time for iOS 12’s release, or at least in a 12.1 release, if they are already time-constrained.
