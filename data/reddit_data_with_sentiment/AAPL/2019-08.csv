AppleWatch,Apple Watch found and returned after spending 3 weeks at the bottom of a lake.,"I was swimming in Squam Lake -NH during 4th of July week in rattlesnake cove (one of dozens) when my watch must have come loose when swimming with my kids. We were probably in 15-25 ft of water and I never noticed the moment it must have slipped off so I had no clue where it could be. When I was able to try the Find My Watch feature it came back as off and obviously not near a WiFi but I still put it in lost mode. Fast forward to this past weekend and I got a text saying ‚ÄúFound this Watch in Squam Lake. Would like to return it.‚Äù Turns out this person was scuba diving in the cove we were in and found the watch at the bottom of the lake. After 3+ weeks submerged it powered right up and he was nice enough to return it. And the kicker... I live 1:20hr outside of the lakes region. The person who found it lived in the town next to me about 12 minutes away. I thought this tale of loss and recovery to be pretty improbable to say the least and worth sharing. 

Always turn in lost mode. Even if you drop your watch to the bottom of a giant lake.",114,1199,2019-08-02,AAPL,0.08772336691617966,0.8832469582557678,0.029029637575149536

By not rejecting this provision, you will forfeit any public court claim against Goldman Sachs. If you are not familiar with arbitration, basically it's a third party HIRED BY Goldman Sachs in order to review the claim by you (the plaintiff) and settle the matter.  In cases of arbitration, decisions are typically in favor of the defendant. If you want to read up on arbitration in the US, there are plenty of resources online and I encourage you to form your opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

While it states you only need to submit the rejection once, I suggest to complete all three options and send the rejection letter via certified mail.

apple,"It was around 2 years ago I decided to build the best desktop experience for Reddit. Even though it started as a native, macOS Reddit app, it turned into an online community browser with support for YouTube, Hacker News, Indie Hackers and more.","TLDR at the end ;)

Hey all,

First of all, I wanted to thank you mods for allowing me to make this post. I love Reddit and even though I don't post much, I spend most of my day on here. Most people check Reddit on their phones. Reddit has a great mobile app and there are lots of alternatives, but I'm a software developer and I spend all my time on my computer.

It was about 2 years ago (around the time Reddit introduced their new website). I was getting really frustrated with the new site and decided to build the best desktop experience for Reddit. Since I use a Mac, I wanted to start out with a native macOS app. I wanted to build something that works fast, feels smooth &amp; modern.

I had to build something that feels like Apple themselves took the time to build a Reddit client for macOS.

As I was working on it, I realized most online communities are the same. There are channels, posts, comments, likes/votes etc. So I thought why not build an open source plugin architecture which allows other developers to build plugins to bring their favorite communities into the app. So far, I already built plugins for YouTube, Hacker News and Indie Hackers in addition to Reddit. I plan on open sourcing all plugins after I polish a few things on my end ;-)

Fast forward to today, the app is almost done and I am now looking for early adopters. It's hard to believe it ended up being almost 2 years project but looking back, it was well worth it!

I'm calling the app Yack! and you can check out the screenshots here:

apple,Apple is shipping $1000 phones with 64gb base storage while Samsung base storage starts at 256GB.,"So I decided to tune in on Samsungs new Note 10 launch. I won't lie I was super salty when I saw Samsung base storage is 256GB with the note 10 at $950. Kinda feels bad considering I paid $999 for my XS with 64GB. I am hoping Apple bumps their base storages across all their products.

Edit: Okay RIP my inbox, did not expect this to make it to the front page. But I'm glad the general consensus is 64GB on a $1000 phone and 128GB (non-upgradable) on a $1200 laptop is not enough. Overtime everything is starting to take more storage so it'd be nice for Apple to step it up and give us a little more for our money.",2609,15874,2019-08-07,AAPL,0.044294822961091995,0.899758517742157,0.05594668909907341

Same thing with the Macbook Pro. The sizes aren‚Äôt in the official name. They market it as just Macbook Pro. 

I feel they will make the next generation iPhone Xr and just call it ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù ‚Äî this is the base model iPhone. They will turn the iPhone Xs and Xs Max to the iPhone Pro.

The naming would then be consistent across the board. It also opens them up to bring back an iPhone SE under a iPhone Air or even iPhone Nano name.

AppleWatch,PSA: Buying Jewelry and/or Personal Articles insurance for your Apple Watch and making a claim WILL show up on your insurance claim history - this CAN/WILL hurt your insurance score and can cause all your insurance premiums to increase. Insurance should really only be used for MAJOR LOSS,"EDIT: This post is regarding insurance in USA.

About 2 years ago I went on a motorcycle trip - on the trip my Rolex crystal was damaged. I had it replaced by Rolex at the cost of 450.00 total - I used my jewelers mutual policy to have it replaced.

No big deal, right?

Wrong - next renewal my rates went up on both my home and my car.  I called and figured out why - it was for a miscellaneous claim under 500.00.

This is NOT even a major claim, it was considered minor.  

It is a not a good idea to make an insurance claim on an Apple watch, especially if Ôøºit is valued over 500.00 - as this would be a major claim.

Insurance should only really be used for catastrophic loss that would be a major hardship/bankrupt loss. 

Yes - it may not affect your insurance rates, as a lot of companies don‚Äôt seem to check your claim history on renewals, but if they do, you‚Äôll pay.

In the end I ended up paying about 800.00 in additional premiums for a watch repair that I could‚Äôve paid the original repair cost for and not even thought about it, but I was naive and thought ‚Äòif I have it, use it.‚Äô 

If this helps anyone I‚Äôm glad - ultimately - do what you want to do, I‚Äôm just trying to save you some cash.

EDIT: Ask your insurer if they report claims to CLUE or A-PLUS - if they do - be certain - that‚Äôs a rate boost.

EDIT: **to all the people saying things like insurance is a scam - here‚Äôs the thing** insurance is all about spreading the risk on catastrophic losses - NOT about covering damages that could be paid out of pocket - we as the insured paid a low, monthly rate, with the risk of a huge claim of 100,000 people being spread out over many thousands of people.

**think about this** if you think everyone who doesn‚Äôt use insurance to make claims on their Apple Watch is a sucker because, hey insurance exists so we can pay 15 dollars to replace a 400 dollar item, where is that 400.00 coming from?  To me, ideas like this are precisely why insurance rates are astronomical. 

Not understanding the underlying design of calculated risk / spread risk of how insurance works does NOT make it a scam.   If you‚Äôre paying 1,000 a year for homeowners insurance and your 250,000 house burns down, that sounds like a pretty fantastic deal to me.",89,545,2019-08-15,AAPL,0.04747393727302551,0.9247305393218994,0.027795568108558655

apple,"The man who stole over $100,000 in iPhones from Apple by walking them out the front door","Hello Apple community,

I've been holding onto this story for a long while now. I've told friends and family about this, and a few coworkers knew about this as well. I've never seen it posted anywhere before, so I figured this would be a good place to share the story. I'm fairly positive this was handled 100% silently and internally by Apple and their temp agency Volt. I don't think there's any reason not to share this publicly, so here it is.

A long time ago, during the iPhone 4 and 4s era, myself and other recent computer science graduates from college took 'Technician' jobs at Apple in Elk Grove, CA, doing repair work on iPhones and iPads. That's what we were *told* it would be anyways; as it turned out it was mainly just 'diagnostic' work, and the 'diagnostics' were tapping the screen to make sure various features were working.

This was a painfully boring job, and the tests were so poorly designed that we ended up failing probably close to a thousand iPads for wifi problems that actually had no wifi problems at all. There were many other issues with the tests that, to this day, still has me wondering how they managed to be implemented... but that's not what this story is about. I digress.

The work was divided into stations. The first couple stations would grab the iPhones (or iPads in the iPad line) that came in and factory reset them using iTunes, each station using about 8 computers simultaneously for higher throughput. The rest of the stations down the line would take each phone and test it for a specific function to make sure it was working. Phone calls, speakerphone, wifi, screen issues, etc.

The work was performed in a warehouse that was fenced in with metal detectors and security all over the entrances. At the time, you were allowed to bring in your phones. If you had an iPhone, you had to register the serial number with security. They would give you a laminated print out with your name and the serial number, and when walking through security you had to show them the print out as well as the serial number on your actual phone. You also had to move the screen around so they could verify it wasn't just a picture of the serial number that you put on the phone.

Attempted theft was surprisingly common. I recall at least a few people that were caught attempting to sneak out iPhones. The most notable of which was the man who put a few phones into his pockets, walked through the metal detector after his shift, and when it went off he dashed for the door in a full blown sprint. Hilariously, *this guy was huge and didn't run very fast at all*, and security got to him *within seconds*.

Successful theft also happened. One of my colleagues later admitted to me (after my employment was long over) that he got an iPhone out on his last day of employment by wearing a giant belt buckle and took an iPhone to the bathroom (located inside the secured area) and taped the iPhone to his skin directly underneath the buckle. When metal detectors went off, security would pull out those metal detector wands and scan you down, and if you showed them your belt buckle was setting it off they'd just let you walk through after the rest of your body was scanned. I always wondered if he prepped the night before making sure he was very smoothly shaven so he wouldn't rip out hairs when removing the phone (lol).

Now to the main point of the story: one newer technician who we'll call Dave, about a few months into his 12 month contract, came up with a very creative way to get iPhones out of the building. During this time, none of us knew what was going on, all we knew was that Dave had a station that he really liked working at; the receiving station. For most of us it was the worst station to work at because your speed set the pace for the rest of the line, and it never had any downtime. We almost always just let him have that station. Even when stations were rotated or assigned by management, he usually managed to hang on to that one by talking his way into it.

As time went on, some of us started realizing that Dave had 2 iPhones he would bring with him in to work, and then take out back through security every day. One of us asked him about it and he said he had a personal phone and a second phone for a side business he was running. A satisfactory answer for us; nobody asked him about it again.

More months passed, and I got a job offer at another company for a 'real' IT position, and several of the techs hired with me were at the end of their 12 month contract, so there was a sudden rotation in people. A couple weeks after my employment ended, I got a call from one of my former colleagues about Dave. Apparently, one of the new techs was inspecting Dave's work really closely, and noticed that Dave was rooting (jailbreaking) some of the iPhones he was working on, and changing the serial numbers to match the serial numbers on his laminated print outs.

Dave would simply walk out to his car with 2 iPhones during lunch, drop them off at his car, walk back in empty handed, and walk back out at the end of the day with 2 more iPhones.

The tech reported him to management and he was arrested. Apple was quiet about the numbers and details, but those of us who worked that specific line who had been at Apple for a while could put 2 and 2 together, and we knew exactly how long this was going on. Figuring that Dave would have easily been able to steal 4 iPhones a day most days, 5 days a week, over a 3 to 4 month period, the total number of iPhones adds up fast!

Last I heard many years ago, Dave was serving time in jail. If I had to guess, I'd bet he'd probably tell you now that the theft wasn't worth it.",135,2795,2019-08-17,AAPL,0.10813864693045616,0.857492208480835,0.034369178116321564

AppleWatch,PSA: You can calibrate your Apple Watch exercise ring by starting an outdoor walk with your watch for 20 minutes.,"Apparently, this [Apple Support article exists](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204516).

&gt; ### Calibrate your Apple Watch
&gt; 1. While wearing your Apple Watch, go to a flat, open outdoor area that offers good GPS reception and clear skies. 
&gt; 2. If you have Apple Watch Series 2 or later, you just need your Apple Watch. If you have Apple Watch Series 1 or earlier, bring your iPhone for GPS. Hold your iPhone in your hand, or wear it on an armband or waistband.
&gt; 3. Open the Workout app. To start, tap Outdoor Walk or Outdoor Run. To set a goal before starting, tap the ... icon.
&gt; 4. Walk or run at your normal pace for about 20 minutes.

I ran into this problem because I have not been going to gym lately due to various reasons. So, the Watch no longer recognize me biking nor walking fast as an exercise, since my heart rate and such never goes above what I had in gym, and that I'm pretty out of shape right now so I have to not overwork my ankle and my feet.

After the calibration, sure enough, I start to see my exercise ring filling up after my morning fast walk to the train station, make it worthwhile again to walk faster than normal so I can fill that green ring every day.

So yeah, give this a try if you think you should've given exercise credit but didn't!",115,705,2019-08-25,AAPL,0.025281477719545364,0.9242299795150757,0.050488535314798355
