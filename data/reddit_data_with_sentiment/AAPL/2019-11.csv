apple,Why is no one is putting Google's Face Unlock thru its paces like EVERYONE did with Apple's FaceID?,"reading [engadget's article](https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/google-s-pixel-4-face-unlock-fiasco/) today where they stated 

""*When I set up Face Unlock with a bare face, I couldn't get into my  phone when I was done up. When I set it up with makeup on, I couldn't  log in after washing my face. This was a problem regardless of how much  makeup I was wearing. The Pixel 4 had trouble recognizing me even when I used a smaller amount, and only logged me in about 50 percent of the  time.*"" really got me wondering about the question in the title.

I am specifically looking at all the youtubers, tech bloggers and tech journalists. Why arent they testing Google's face unlock like they did with FaceID ? I remember seeing FaceID videos that involved dot projector detection camera's, makeup videos, face masks, twins, beards, sunglasses, accessories... you name it, but none of those for face unlock. 

if you just do a search for ""FaceID "" on youtube, 6 of the top 10 results are on testing FaceID of some kind... more if you keep scrolling, whereas if you did a search on ""face unlock"", ""pixel face unlock"" or ""google face unlock""... nothing!? thoughts?",157,439,2019-11-02,AAPL,0.04892301186919212,0.9240440726280212,0.027032919228076935
apple,AirPods Pro vs Bose QC35 on a 15 hour flight - my review,"Hey guys,

I picked up the AirPods Pro at the Apple Store the moment it opened on Wednesday. I then immediately hopped on a flight from the US to Hong Kong - here are my thoughts:

**COMFORT**

YESSSSSSSSSS this is what I’ve been dreaming of! I hated the big headphones when trying to rest my head against a pillow trying to sleep. I hated the AirPods falling out and me having to search the floor and my seat for them when I wake up and realized they were gone. I hated the QC20s because I would get tangled up in the wires. 

This is what I was looking for. Thank you, Apple.

**NOISE CANCELLATION**

Ok so this is why we’re all here, right? Noise cancellation was incredible. Honestly incredible. They were on par with the QC35s, and in some aspects, better. I found that it cancelled the background hum very slightly better than the QC35s, and also better at cancelling out voices - though I think this was more the isolation part than the active noise cancellation. With the Bose, if there is a cabin announcement or a flight attendant is talking to me, I’m usually aware of it enough to be able to know it’s going on and take off my headphones. With these, honestly, I often found myself not even aware - they were that good. 

Probably a flight attendants nightmare, but I did find myself being able to see when they were going through the aisles and put it into transparency mode. 

One big difference with noise - with the Bose, during takeoff, on some of the planes/engines that I fly (I fly 200k miles a year), I find that the noise cancellation doesn’t work well and it ends up making an awful noise for a few seconds, to the point where I sometimes have to take them off. There’s just some frequency that it doesn’t like. This was not an issue with the AirPods Pro. Additionally, when I rest my head against the side of the airplane to sleep with the Bose, the vibration often caused noise in the Bose. Not an issue with the AirPods Pro since they don’t stick out enough to hit the side of the plane. 

**USAGE WITH IFE**

Okay so this part is a bit more annoying. With the QC35s, I can just plug them into the IFE. For this, I had to use Twelve South’s AirFly. It works. It’s another thing to carry around and keep charged. But it works. 

**BATTERY LIFE**

OOOOOOOkey. So here’s where things go south. Battery life is dismal. A fully charged set, brand new, lasts 4.5 hours. My flight, after including boarding, taxi, takeoff, and landing, was well over 16 hours. That’s a problem. It’s unrealistic to get a 100% charge - in reality, it won’t be ever really fully charged since it charges much faster at lower %, and you’d have to wait much longer for a full charge than a 80% charge. So, on a 16 hour flight like mine, you’d have to charge like 5 times - and that’s what I did.

Thankfully, the charge time is relatively fast. I put it in the case every time I got up to go to the bathroom, and it wasn’t too bad. It would drop down to 10%, I’d get up to use the bathroom, walk around, stretch, get back and it’s charged to 50%. Workable, but really not great. It also means that you can’t keep listening to your entertainment while walking around the cabin, which I liked doing. 

I wish they had made it a bit longer like the original AirPods and improved the battery life instead. 

**CONCLUSION**

Okay so what does this mean: for short/medium haul flights, such as domestic USA flights, this replaces my Bose QC35. Period. I’m leaving that bulky case at home from now on. 

For long haul flights... it’s a bit tougher of a sell with the battery life where it is. On my flight here, I left the Bose in the case other than for the direct comparison, and it was a bit of a hassle. If the QC35 batteries die, you can still use them sans noise cancellation. If the AirPods Pro die, you’re SOL. I think for trips where I’m concerned about packing light, I’ll forgo the Bose for the AirPods Pro, but if I have the space to spare, the Bose will still stay with me.",271,436,2019-11-02,AAPL,0.08770018070936203,0.8795489072799683,0.03275096416473389

apple,This is quite possibly the single biggest software UI design problem affecting the tech world today. It's everywhere from Netflix to YouTube to Apple Music to the new Apple TV app.,"**The overuse of curation, where the entire interface is built around suggestions and recommendations - to the point that the entire UI feels like one big advertisement.**

This is something that has been bugging me for some time and I think a lot of people can relate. The tech world has become far too obsessed with curation and that has really harmed the end user experience. Curation (for TV shows, movies, music, etc...) is an important feature to suggest new content to check out, but it should be a feature, NOT the foundation of the user interface. That just makes for a bad UX because it makes the entire interface feel like one giant advertisement.

We see this problem across the tech world - from YouTube to Netflix to Apple Music and now the Apple TV app - and I think we need to see a shift in focus. Curation should be a feature, not the entire paradigm around which an app is built.

Here's what I mean: **[Curation Should Be A Feature, Not A User Interface](https://medium.com/@heyyoudvd/curation-should-be-a-feature-not-a-user-interface-ae52384bc30c)**

This has been terrible for several years now with regards to Apple Music, and now the same issue is popping up with the emergence of Apple TV.

-------------------------------------------

**Here's how Apple TV should work:**

**Apple:** *Hey, we've got this great new TV app that functions as a repository for all your content. You pick and choose what 'Channels' you want, you order them within the TV app, and the TV app functions as a central repository for all your content, all organized in one unified UI that's accessible via any of your Apple devices and controllable via Siri. You sign up for Channels, those media companies get paid, and we get a cut of that for providing the unified service, just like with our App Store model. Oh, and we'll throw in our own TV+ channel for free, as a perk to entice you into this TV ecosystem!*

**Users:** *Awesome! Here are the 15 shows I want to watch! I'll order all the services I need in order to get those 15 shows, and then you'll provide a UI where I can track and watch those 15 shows!*

**Apple:** *Will do!*

-------------------------------------------

But that's not how it works. The ""Watch Now"" tab is a complete mess, with everything from every streaming service (including TV+) being thrown at you like a series of ads. I think what **SHOULD** happen is the ""Up Next"" functionality should be dramatically expanded and given its own tab, so that it functions like I highlighted above - you add the shows you're watching and it functions like one of those TV show tracker apps, to keep track of everything you've watched, allowing you to rate each episode, telling you when the next episode airs, and of course, allowing you to watch it.

The ""Watch Now"" tab will continue to exist, but maybe it can be renamed ""Browse"" or ""Recommendations"" so that it continues to curate and recommend content for you. But once you see things that interest you, you'd add them to the new tab, which can be called ""Collection"", or maybe even the ""Library"" tab could be converted into this.

**tl;dr - The Apple TV app should add a new tab in which you can add all the shows across all streaming services/'Channels' you want, and you'd have a UI that functions like one of those TV tracker apps, listing all the shows you're currently following, your progress, your ratings for each episode, the next air dates, and of course, allowing you to watch the next episode.**",134,1167,2019-11-04,AAPL,0.09288762509822845,0.8783724308013916,0.028739959001541138

iphone,What measures does Apple take in terms of software to reduce OLED burn-in and yellowing on iPhones?,"So, I know there have been similar posts related to this topic (as I have read them all). However -- although they almost all mention that one shouldn't worry about OLEDs on iPhones -- none of them explains what EXACTLY Apple does in software to counteract or delay the inevitable degradation of its OLED displays.

The reason I'm asking is because I would like to buy the 11 Pro and use it for at least 3-4 years, but I just know I will constantly be checking the screen for burn-ins... 

Knowing about these methods would provide a bit of reassurance and peace of mind. Pixel shifting comes to mind. And... that's about it.

Thanks in advance.

apple,iOS 13 Has a Built-in Decibel Meter That Works with Apple/Beats Headphones,"After requesting a feature like this for years, I’m thrilled to be able to share that iOS 13 has a headphone decibel meter that actively tracks loudness levels. It’s able to provide average listening levels sorted by day and headphone type, as well as a real-time decibel level. 

Reasonable listening levels prevent hearing loss, but also mean that music is able to sound its best. Listening at above 90dB causes a reflex where the ear  tries to protect itself to limit damage, which leads to a muffled listening experience and a desire to continuously listen louder. I’ve noticed a dangerous trend where consumers will instinctively set the volume to max, then complain that their headphones don’t get loud enough — this is the reason. 

It’s calibrated to work accurately with Apple/Beats headphones for obvious reasons, but it‘s capable of providing an estimate for any headphone.

Find it in the Health app - Hearing - Headphone Audio Levels.

It’s socially responsible to promote this feature, and build upon it so it isn’t just buried in the Health app.",114,981,2019-11-16,AAPL,0.030586006119847298,0.9343603849411011,0.03505367040634155

apple,PSA: Tip for those experiencing diminished AirPods battery life,"I have the 1st generation, original AirPods that I've owned since their release (~3 years ago as of writing).  The battery life for each AirPod has been steadily decreasing over time, down to about 1.5 hours of audio-only usage before needing a recharge in their case, which is frustratingly short.

Before throwing them away, I decided to try one last trick.  I completely reset the AirPods case (holding down the white button on the back for 10+ seconds), and re-paired them with my iPhone.  I then completely drained both AirPods down to zero, and the case itself down to zero through normal usage.  Then, I put the dead AirPods into the dead case, and charged them both up to 100%.  

This combination of reset/drain/recharge seems to have re-calibrated the battery life measurement system, and they no longer die at 1.5 hours. I'm now getting double that at around 3 - 3.5 hours, which is great for such an old pair.  Hopefully this helps anybody experiencing this same thing.   Try this battery recalibration!

I wondered if changing my testing method would make a difference. I did a second run on each website. But this time, I tested each phone individually, instead of simultaneously, before moving on to the other. Testing the phones out one by one yielded better results in every case, though the XS still beat the 11 Pro in all but one case.~~

Overall, my 11 Pro won 2/8 times. My XS won 4/8 times, and the SE won 2/8.

I'm cool with these results, as long as it's normal. Is it?

EDIT: I wanted to mention this is my second 11 Pro. I had to swap out my old 11 Pro for an unrelated issue. Anyways, when I did these tests with my first 11 Pro, it handily beat my XS in **every** case, but I didn't write anything down because I didn't think anything of it.


Results on 5GHz (2.4GHz disabled). Leaving out the SE to save time.

More edits:

- To reiterate, the first four runs were done at the same time, and all other tests were done individually.
- I understand that there are other factors that can affect wifi speeds. But what I don't understand is how my first iPhone 11 Pro consistently beat my XS, while my second 11 Pro is consistently losing, sometimes by significant margins, against the same device. I used the same four websites last time. 
- So far, I've reset my router and also reset the network settings on my iPhone 11 Pro. In a few hours, I'll run these tests again and provide an update.

Update: Results after resetting network settings on 11 Pro and resetting router. XS still comes out ahead:

***PERFORMANCE:*** Geekbench 5/Cinebench/Unigine Heaven/Black Magic/Crystal Disk Mark

Geekbench 5 (CPU):

* Average score from 5 results SL3 15: **871 (Single-Core)/3164 (Multi-Core)**
* 16-inch MBP: There aren't any benchmarks as of the day I'm posting this, so I'll use this [video](https://youtu.be/gGLqcX3Iaes?t=342) and my result as a reference for now:

1. **(Video) 1103 (Single-Core)/5667 (Multi-Core)**
2. **(My results) 1137 (Single-Core)/5762 (Multi-Core)**

Cinebench 20 average of 5 (CPU):

* SL3 15: 1987
* 16-inch MBP: 2649

Black Magic and Crystal Disk Mark (SSD):

MBPs always had the fastest SSDs and it's no different here. Here are two tests done by laptopmag: [Test 1](https://prnt.sc/pzq9zo)///[Test 2.](https://prnt.sc/pzqes4) The file [copy test speed](https://prnt.sc/q0rx0n) is surprisingly low on the SL3. I also got very slow results on CDM:

* Crystal Disk Mark--SL3 15: 963 mb/s read and 1578 mb/s write
* Black Magic--16-inch MBP: 3094 mb/s read and 2881 mb/s write

3D Mark Fire Strike (GPU):

* SL3: 3019
* 16"" MBP: 8492

Cinebench 15R average of 5 (GPU):

* SL3 15: 55.7 FPS/926 cb
* 16-inch MBP: 109.4 FPS/1158 cb

Unigine Heaven 4 (GPU):

* SL3: 25.1 FPS average
* 16-inch MBP: 48.3 FPS average
* A GPU comparison from [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/GeForce-GTX-1650-Laptop-vs-Vega-11_9828_8470.247598.0.html) of the Vega 11 vs NVIDIA GTX 1650 that's slower than the 5300M. The GTX 1650 beats the Vega 11. Thus we can conclude that the 5300M beats the Vega 11 since it also beats the GTX 1650 tested here with a [gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogd5p8UZdR8) comparison (5300M vs GTX 1650).

To conclude, I was very surprised by how underwhelming the performance was from the SL3----from the CPU to the GPU and to even the SSD speed. At the same price, the difference in performance shouldn't be this substantial, not mentioning the SL3 also has worse thermal cooling (reached 105 degrees!!!)--but you do get double the RAM I guess?

***DISPLAY:***

The highest I hit on the SL3 15's 2K display is 367 nits, which is about average, and 466 nits on my 16"" MBP, which is great. The display quality between the 16"" MBP and the SL3 is also huge. With only a 93% sRGB color range, **you will not be able to do any professional work relying on color--this laptop is a no go for artists, designers, content creators, video/film, anyone that focuses on color.** The SL3's display is not professional grade. It's fine for media consumption, but if you mainly want to use it for browsing/media, there are other laptops with better/similar displays and performance for almost half the price--or even the intel i5 version of the SL3.

The 3K display on the MBP on the other hand is rated as [one of the best](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Notebook-Displays-As-Reviewed-By-Notebookcheck.120541.0.html) laptop displays. It has 100% DCI-P3 and 93% AdobeRGB--the display quality alone is worth 200-$300 compared to the SL3. Another advantage Macs have is their image/text scaling. TLDR, MacOS does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. The reason why many professionals use Macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you’re working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. It’ll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from MacOS in this case. True Tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency, I would recommend you to turn it off. The 16-inch MBP display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles than the SL3.

Touchscreen/touchbar wise both aren’t too useful in my opinion. With the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links I guess? But most of the time it‘s really awkward/annoying because I have to reach further from my keyboard when I’m working—which slows down my workflow—when I can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. I also find that besides the scrolling here and there, I barely use it. Also, it’s a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. The touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it’s actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***BUILD/OTHERS***

Thickness and weight wise, both are about the same (0.57 inch 3.9 pounds SL3/0.64 inch 4.3 pounds MBP). Both are very well-built machines made out of aluminum. But the difference in battery life is significant--up to 4 hours more on the MBP. With normal web browsing at 300 nits, the SL3 lasted 6 hours while the MBP lasted 8 hours and 24 minutes. At 300 nits while working on video/photo editing and some light gaming, the SL3 lasted only 4 hours and 17 minutes. In comparison, my MBP at the same brightness and workflow lasted close to 7 hours. Performance on the SL3 also drops dramatically when it's not plugged in--around 40-65% depending. The MBP on the other hand stays roughly the same (less than 15% drop) without being plugged in. As a result of constant charging for performance, the SL3’s battery will deteriorate faster in the long run. This also happened with many of my windows laptops. My 2017 Dell XPS has already dropped by roughly 50%, whereas my 2016 MBP lasts me 3 hours more.

The keyboard and track-pad on the SL3 however, was a pleasant surprise. Although it’s still clear that the MBP's track-pad is still a tier above every other laptop, what the SL3 has to offer is very good--one of the best from the windows side of things. The keyboard on the SL3 is also great, although still not quite in the same tier as ThinkPads and the new magic keyboard on the 16""--but Microsoft is getting very close. Audio wise (speakers/mic), the 16"" wins hands down in this area as well. MBPs has always had the best audio, but the 16"" takes that a step further and makes the older gen MBPs sound outdated, even though they had the best speakers already. The SL3 however, has a better port selection and doubles the RAM. But weirdly it doesn't have any thunderbolt 3 ports, whereas the 16"" MBP has 4. In order to get the same ports, you'd need to spend $50 more for a port hub on the MBP--then again, the extra thunderbolts are very useful for professional workflows. And although Microsoft claims their SSDs are ""removable"", they make the process [a pain in the ass](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-ssd-repair-upgrade) to do so. But nevertheless, it's still a step forward from Apple's soldered on SSDs.

To conclude, the Surface Laptop 3 does a great job in terms of feel and design----but the performance (CPU/GPU/SSD speed), display quality, and battery life you get when compared to the 16"" MBP at the same price is almost laughable. At the same price, the 16"" MBP beats the SL3 in literally every category besides storage/ram amount. I understand that you don't have the same ports, but you can spend $50 more to get a port hub and get MORE ports than what the SL3 offers--aka 4 extra thunderbolt 3s while getting way better performance/display/battery/etc.

In terms of professional usage/workflow, it's a no-brainer to get the 16"" MBP. You're essentially scamming and handicapping your own productivity if you buy the SL3. However, if you want a device for average/light use, then I would actually recommend you to get the **13.5-inch/i5 version** of the SL3, or the Dell XPS 13, or a ThinkPad. If you're a designer/artist/in fine arts, then you should definitely get the 13-inch MBP for its top-of-the-line color accuracy/consistency/calibration. Here is more information regarding 4K OLEDs in the **display section** of my [XPS 15 comparison.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dz7ewx/macbook_pro_16_vs_dell_xps_15_7950an_indepth/)

Also, **DO NOT** buy the 13.5"" i7 version of the SL3 even though it has a 10th Gen i7. It might seem inciting, but the thermals/performance is lacking (mainly because of the lower end GPU which also forces more work onto the CPU while in a smaller body). The performance under heavier workloads is sometimes worse than the 15"" version Ryzen 7, and substantially worse than the 16-inch MBP at the same price of $2399. The GPU inside is also an INTEL IRIS PLUS--a downgrade from the AMD RX Vega 11 that's already way behind the 5300M in the MBP.",210,307,2019-11-24,AAPL,0.062123542030652366,0.8964202801386515,0.041456191490093865
