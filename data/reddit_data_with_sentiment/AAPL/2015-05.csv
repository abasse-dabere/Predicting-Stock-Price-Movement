apple,2.5 weeks with the new Macbook. Some conclusions,"This was a purchase I had been looking forward to for almost two years. My 2011 13"" MB Air (with the 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 and 4 GB 1333 MHz RAM) had been the best laptop I'd ever had. It had been my daily machine for both work and play since I bought it in mid 2011. Not a single problem ever, except the battery life had degraded significantly, but not unexpectedly. It was my first mac (before that I was a linux user). My typical workload is email, office, terminal work, light coding, and some virtual machines. For play, I use it for lightroom for photo. Everything worked fine on the laptop's display, but when I try and drive my external 4K its unusable. I'd seen retina displays since they came out and was anxiously waiting for the MB Air to get one. As soon as it did, that would be the machine to replace the sturdy veteran 2011 model I relied on for everything.

I admit that I was a bit torn when I heard the new Macbook announced. What I wanted was an updated Air with a retina display and specs more or less on par with a 2014 Air. I wasn't expecting the computer to get thinner, smaller, or lighter. When the Core M processor was announced, I became worried even though none of my work required heavy processing. I do however expect some amount of performance increase when I refresh my machine. I began considering the 2015 rMBP and the reviews that came out for it made me really wonder if that was the real machine I was after. It was really hard to consider getting a machine that was heavier and thicker (no matter how small the difference is between the rMBP and my MBA). I have a strong 4k workstation at home and knew that my ideal setup would be to replace it with a 5k iMac and replace my air with the new Macbook, but that was too expensive an option to really consider. 

In the weeks between the Macbook announcement and the release date, I would go back and forth between the Macbook and the rMBP. Part of me loved the idea of getting a thinner, lighter, longer battery life, more powerful, and retina display machine. Then the more practical side would tell me that being safer with the heavier, but definitely more powerful option was better. I waited for the first reviews on the Macbook, and decided to go for it knowing I could always return it and get the rMBP. My Macbook arrived on April 16, and I wanted to report back on how its been working in case there are others like me who seemed to fall right between the consumer vs pro offerings in Apple's current line. I'm going to assume you've all read the professional reviews and just focus on the main talking points that seem to be so polarizing for this computer. 

First on the USB C port. Its just a but annoying now when I want to save a presentation onto a memory stick and bring it to a conference room in my office. However, as a whole I do not miss the extra ports at all. In fact I really enjoy the idea of bringing this machine and plugging a single cord for my external display, ethernet, and power. I could be doing that already, but I'm waiting for the monoprice or other cheaper option rather than Apple's $79 option. 

The keyboard took barely two hours to get used to and its a major improvement in my mind. its much more accurate to me than the scissor style (and I loved that keyboard a lot to). The presses are much cleaner and the lower press height improves my typing speed. I have fairly large hands, so the larger surface area of the keys is a plus for me. The other amazing thing I love is that the keyboard no longer leaves fingerprints on the screen when you close the lid. This used to drive me crazy on my air as I hate seeing smudges on the screen. 

The screen itself is everything I wanted it to be. I have it set to More Space option rather than default as I can't live with a applied resolutions less than my old air. Its retina and we all know how amazing that looks. I can't look at regular screens again without feeling let down. However, I will say that looking at a physically smaller screen is a let down for me. The effective real estate is the same and its all fully readable, but there is a sense that its all smaller and I don't like that.  Also, even though I've upgraded to retina, it doesn't feel as much as an upgrade because the effective resolution is the same as my old air. That is something I don't like.

The touchpad is also an improvement and not something I expected they could make better. I can't tell that there isn't a mechanical press. I don't use safari or other mac apps that have built in functionality , so I can say anything about force click, but having another level of interaction for clicks is huge for me.

Battery life is good but not great. For me it doesn't really feel like an 'all day' type device like an iPhone or an iPad. If I'm working heavily on the machine, I can't help but get worried when it is below 20%. I really wish I could give up Chrome browser because I'm sure that would save me more battery life, but it just syncs so well across all my windows, linux, and mac environments that I can't switch to safari. 

The processor speed has only twice been an issue for me. Lightroom worked totally fine for everything I needed it to do (my desktop is my main photo processing station though, so this is just quick and light work). I've only had slow downs with a ton of tabs and programs up and running. Spotify in particular seems to be more of a resource hog than it should be, but even in these worst case scenario situations it just makes the spaces transitions a bit jerky. Nothing else has been a problem. My concerns in this area were blown out of proportion. Its definitely fast enough for everything I need it to do. If this were my only machine and I didn't have my desktop, then I think I definitely would have gone with the MBP though. The body of the machine has only been warm a few times. I love that it is totally silent. This gets swept aside a lot, but a truly silent computer is a big deal for me. 

So overall, this is a great laptop and I plan on keeping it with no hesitations. Its great to feel my work bag get even lighter (the charger for this is basically the same as a iPad's) and its so easy to carry around to meetings and flights. Its amazing how light and well designed it is. It essentially has the same footprint as a legal pad, and doesn't weigh much more either. However, its made me think of what my ideal laptop would be. Since this is a 12"" Macbook, my ideal would likely be a 14"" version with a larger screen with higher resolution, 2 USB C ports, and longer battery life. I imagine the processor would be scaled as well to accommodate driving the larger display, so that also is a plus for me.  If the 14"" had to be a bit thicker and heavier, I wouldn't mind, but I'd not want it to be heavier or as thick as my old Air. That machine feels big in my hands now when I use it. 

I love how thin this computer is in more than just an aesthetic way. For me its a true level of functionality to be able to just quickly grab it with one hand without thinking; opening and closing the lid for quick note taking, and dropping it in my bag and barely noticing its in there. Its very similar to an iPad in this way. It feels like something you can always have with you and can dive into at a moment's notice. An iPad though always felt like a device for consuming content; this is the first device that brings that level of quick access to content creation and thats what I've been waiting for.

So in conclusion, the Macbook hasn't been as transformative as my 2011 MB Air purchase. That laptop made me feel like I had reached a new level of productivity given how much of an upgrade it was from my previous laptops. The bar for the new Macbook was set quite high yet I'm extremely happy with it. However it has left me with a vision for what my ideal laptop would be. That ideal machine wouldn't be much different than the new Macbook, but it wouldn't be exactly this machine (and not for the reasons that most reviewers have been critical of).",307,385,2015-05-03,AAPL,0.04591692052781582,0.9127844870090485,0.04129857383668423

AppleWatch,My (Yet Another) Apple Watch Rambling Thoughts After One Week,"I’ve had the Apple Watch for almost one week now. Worn it from approximately 6:30am - 1am every day. Here are my unorganized, random, and personal thoughts on it.

Just for reference, I ordered the Apple Watch Sport 42mm in Space Gray on April 10th at 2:04am CST and it arrived Monday April 27th. (Hope everyone in ""processing"" hell gets theirs soon.)

* I should’ve gotten the **stainless steel**. When I opened my box, I wasn’t impressed with the Sport. It looks almost like a toy. I know it isn’t but the case kind of looks plastic. Strange that I didn’t notice that at my try-on appointment. The stainless steel looks classier and so much more luxurious. Mental note for v2.
* **Sport band**. I agree with everyone else on the quality and comfort. It’s so comfortable. And *feels* high quality. The part I disagree with people about is the difficulty in putting it on. I only spent 5 extra seconds the first time I put it on to figure out how to do it without using a table or an Apple store employee. I actually think it’s easier than putting on a regular clasp watch band now.
* **Battery**. Like others have noted, battery life has been a non-factor. It’s great. I never once had battery life anxiety. I ended up with about 35-45% battery life each day with moderate to heavy use. I even slept with it one night to measure my sleeping heart rate (also I hate wearing bands / watches to bed) and still had 33% in the morning. A little over one hour charge while I showered and got ready and it was at 99%.
* **Taptic engine**. No major issues noticing when I get “tapped”. I have it on the default setting. It’s subtle and noticeable at the same time. It’s perfect. Probably my favorite thing about this watch. (BTW one of the first things I did was turn off sounds. I prefer my notifications just notify me and not everyone around me too - personal preference).
* **Size**. I’m a guy and I have 150mm size wrists, which from all the comments and posts regarding size I think I have one of if not the smallest wrists around. Also from almost everything I’ve read I should’ve gotten a 38mm Apple Watch. I’m sure it would’ve worked/looked fine (tho in the store it looked too “feminine” to me) but 42mm works/looks fine too (plus better battery life).
* **Heart rate tracking** is very cool. I never thought I’d be that interested in it but it’s fun and informative to see. Especially during workouts I can see my target heart rate. I bought a chest strap years ago but never used it because it was uncomfortable and probably what it feels like to wear a bra. Having a reliable, accurate one on a watch is wonderful.
* **Work out app**. Working out with it is enjoyable. I’ve only gone running with it and done some [HIIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) and it’s been nice to have the information readily available (heart rate, distance, time elapsed, pace, time) without the awkward head and shoulder twist to see it on your phone screen from your armband. I also like getting the badges for achievements.
* **Activity tracker**. “Tap tap” - it’s time to stand! I haven’t been annoyed or bothered by this. I don’t always act on it, but I appreciate the reminder. The activity tracker rings are motivating. I feel a strange OCD desire to complete the circles.
* **Apps** (3rd party). I don’t like any of them very much. It just takes too long to do anything super useful. I’m sure it’ll get better but for now I don’t like any of them. I don’t want to stare at my watch and scroll through my Instagram feed. The only one I do like is [Due](http://www.dueapp.com/). But the only reason it works well is because I don’t really have to interact with it proactively. It just reminds me of things and keeps reminding me until I do it or clear it. (Seriously tho, I need to take my dog on a walk)
* **Watch faces**. I find myself changing watch faces multiple times a day depending on my mood / environment / what I’m doing. It’s awesome. I’m surprised that [Solar](http://images.apple.com/v/watch/d/timekeeping/images/solar_large.jpg) is my favorite watch face though (I thought [Modular](http://www.applewatchbandsclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/modular.png) would be my favorite since it packs in a lot of information). I have no idea how to explain it but I love seeing the sun’s position in the sky when I look at my watch. I feel like I have a better sense of where I’m at in my day - even though the time itself should tell me that.
* **Glances**. They take too long. Glances are supposed to be… glances. Not swipe through and wait 5 seconds to refresh with data. It doesn’t feel right to wait that long with your arm held up like that. I want to raise my wrist, slide up, get to the right glance, read the info, and get on with my life. Yes, it’s faster than pulling out my phone and getting the information from it but it feels slower. It’s kind of like the feeling of spending 30 minutes in bumper-to-bumper traffic vs 40 minutes cruising down an alternative (tho longer) route to get to the same destination.
* **Phone calls**. It’s nice to have the option - when it’s quiet. If you have any ambient noise and you have your hands away from your face (like typing on a keyboard), it’s hard to hear from that tiny watch speaker. I asked my friends if they could hear me well and they said they had no problem hearing me. I’d much rather use my phone or bluetooth headset for long calls but like I said - it’s nice to have the option.
* **Notifications**. It’s so nice to just have a “tap tap” on the wrist and be able to see the text, email, activity, etc at a glance and ignore or take quick action. Having said that, I hate information overload. I’ve silenced all notifications except calls, texts, some emails, reminders, and activity tracker (stand up, move, work out).
* **Siri**. Impressive speech recognition. I wish it was faster. Speech-to-text and the response. It works well, but there are too many phrases that just don’t work. I just want to talk to it and have it understand me, but I find that I’m always trying to wordsmith my commands in a format that she’ll understand that doesn’t send me to Handoff “search the web” purgatory.
* **Function**. Here is what I’ve spent the better part of the week trying to figure out. How does this little miracle device fit into my life? I honestly felt a bit confused when I finally opened the box and strapped it to my wrist. Like - now what? I think I half expected some great epiphany from just having it on my wrist. Sure, I played with all the functions and digital crowned through the emojis but I had trouble envisioning what role it played in my day-to-day. I did end up getting that epiphany but it took me a week and here it is. It’s personal. The device is designed to be personal. Meaning you get to customize it for your life which is different from my life. For me, I think I figured out how it fits into mine. It’s a super cool watch. It’s not a small iPhone on my wrist. I don’t see it as something I play with as I’m waiting in line at the DMV. I don’t want to get notified of every app activity. I ended up turning off all notifications and then started turning specific notifications on as I got them on my phone and I decided I wanted it on my watch. I just love having a watch that tells me the time, looks good, and discreetly reminds me of important things. It complements my life.

TL;DR: I like it. Should’ve gotten stainless steel. It’s a personal device. Customize it for your own life.

apple,My thoughts on the Apple watch after eleven days (long review),"My [last post on the Apple Watch](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/341ife/my_thoughts_on_the_apple_watch_after_three_days/) generated some interest, so I thought I’d write a follow-up which addresses some new aspects of the device, revisits my initial opinions, and concludes with some analysis of the watch’s utility.

(Apologies for reposting this; the formatting got screwed up last night and I couldn’t edit the post).

**After a week and a half—have my early impressions changed?**

No, not fundamentally. 

**The good:**

I’m even more bullish about the battery than I was before. It’s always at 40-50% by the end of the day. I imagine that this reserve will be needed for native apps on the phone when a full SDK is released, and I’m glad it’s there. I’ve never once worried about the watch dying on me. I also can’t emphasize enough how brilliant wireless charging is.

I also think I was too harsh on how cumbersome it is to access to the app screen/apps. Having done this many more times over the past week, I’ve gotten used to it and it’s fairly streamlined.

**The bad:**

**Haptic touch**

Haptic feedback is inexcusably weak and notifications are so brief that sometimes my brain just filters them out. Without turning on “prominent haptic,” I’d miss half of my alerts (note: prominent mode only applies to some alerts, not all). With the prominent setting on, I can feel it when I’m at home or in my office. I haven’t missed a text message in 10 days, which is neat. However, I maintain that regular taps are too weak to be detected during bicycling, while playing sports, on a motorcycle, or even when driving in a car that vibrates a lot or is on bumpy roads.

*Note:* I went to the Apple store yesterday to see if this was normal or if I had a defective unit. There’s didn’t seem to be anything wrong with the watch, but to their credit they are willing to do a swap/repair. However, I was able to compare mine with an employee's watch and the difference was very slight. His might have been a tiny bit rumblier because it was the larger 42mm model, but they were about identical. He also confessed that he couldn’t feel turn-by-turn notifications. I then spoke to someone from 1-800-MY-APPLE who told me that while he was able to feel all the taps, he had spoken to a client earlier in the day with the same problem as me. At this point, I'm tempted to conclude that this isn't an issue of broken haptic motors, but of perception. Some people find it too weak, some people find it OK. In any case, *everyone* I spoke to had haptic feedback set to maximum, which tells me that Apple didn't choose a powerful enough motor.

**Raising your wrist to glance**

Raising your wrist to glance doesn’t consistently turn the watch on, especially when you just tilt your arm slightly to glance at the time. I’ve spent a ton of time testing this to see how much movement is required to activate the watch. It seems like your wrist needs to rotate by at least 30 or 40 degrees. Speed also factors into it, as does whether you hold your wrist immobile after the movement. What’s exasperating is that the opposite action—rotating your watch away from your face to turn it off—takes almost no technique at all. The slightest movement will turn it off. 

When it fails to turn on—which is maybe 25% of the time, but often enough to be annoying—you have to reach over and tap to turn it on (flopping your wrist back and forth rarely registers and is absurd in any case). When something that should be a one-handed operation requires two hands, you have a design failure. When tilting your wrist back slightly causes the screen to turn off while you’re doing something, you have a second design failure. When the watch sometimes gets stuck and won’t turn on at all even if you do a crazily exaggerated cartoon wrist raise, then you have a third design failure. I don’t know what’s going on here, but it needs work.

**Siri**

After extensive use, I’ve concluded that Siri is broken on the watch.

Above all else, “Hey Siri” just doesn’t work a lot of the time in noisy environments. Nothing makes you feel dumber than talking to your wrist and having nothing happen, except being forced to repeat yourself to your wrist even louder and clearer than before, especially if other people are around. It’s also distracting that there’s lag between the time “Hey Siri” triggers the listening and the time when you receive visual feedback that the watch is processing your speech. You never quite know whether the watch is listening or not.

Next, I dislike having to hold down the digital crown while I’m talking. It turns what should be a one-handed operation into a two-handed operation. The iPhone home button doesn’t need to be held down the entire time you talk to Siri; that’s the way it should be here, too. 

Finally, the haptic feedback to let you know that Siri is listening is way too feeble (lighter than any other notification on the watch). Worse, however, is that there’s no clear visual cue that Siri is listening. On the iPhone, you get a double cue: first, the round microphone icon turns into a wiggly waveform and second, you hear a characteristic double tone (even if the phone is muted). On the watch, there is no audio cue (even if sound is turned on) and the visual cue is inconsistent. Normally, there’s text at the top of the screen and a waveform at the bottom. However, sometimes the waveform doesn’t appear and you’re not sure whether Siri is “ready” or not. By the time you decide she is and start talking, she’s usually turned herself off. Very frustrating. This varies from attempt to attempt. Here you can see [an inactive waveform](http://i.imgur.com/Fo9MPpF.png), and here you can see [an active waveform](http://i.imgur.com/srSCCu0.png). In both cases, Siri is “on” and listening.

**What else is new?**

**Watch brightness outside**

The watch isn’t very visible in bright daylight. [Here’s a picture of it outside on a sunny day](http://i.imgur.com/wfqTn4H.jpg). Believe it or not, it’s on (zoom in and squint), but the camera could barely capture the light coming from the screen. It’s a little more legible in person than it appears in the photo, but everything looks washed out and faded. Even on cloudy days, you have to work a little to see the faded text and images. This is less than ideal, though the watch remains usable. Interestingly, the watch face becomes *more* visible when you’re wearing sunglasses (is this an AMOLED thing?). This offsets the effect of the sun somewhat.

**Continuity**

This works well. If I’m reading on my phone, I won’t get any notifications on the watch. If all my devices are stowed, everything goes to the watch instead. If the watch is off my wrist, it won’t buzz at all. Only once did I receive a call and my MacBook, my iPhone, and my watch all started ringing at the same time. I guess Apple is still perfecting this, but there’s very little redundancy in terms of notifications, so hats off.

**Force Touch**

I keep reading posts here from people who say that Apple absolutely needs to bring force touch to other iOS devices. I don’t see the urgency. This feature is a necessary expedient given the watch’s size (apps are too small for multiple touch targets or hamburger menus). I understand why it’s there, and it’s not because it improves the user experience: it’s out of necessity. Force touch menus hide functionality and oblige the user to guess whether it’s there or not. Sometimes you force touch and nothing happens. Sometimes you can’t figure out where an obvious function is and then you realize you have to force touch to access it (which means that in practice, 90% of users are not going to know how to access the functionality of apps that do this). It took me two days to realize that I had to force touch to adjust my Mint spending allocation, and I’m far from being techno-incompetent. My parents and less geeky friends would never have found it.

**Calling**

Calling works with varying degrees of success depending on where you are. The watch speakers are too tinny to be heard outside or in noisy environments. When walking down a residential street with moderate traffic, I had to constantly hold the watch up to my ear to hear the person on the line, and then lower it to my mouth to speak. It’s also tiring to hold your arm up like Dick Tracy while you take a call.

On the other hand, using the watch for calls at home when it’s quiet works really well. One of my favourite things to do is take a call on my watch while I’m cooking. I can keep chopping ingredients and stirring pots while chatting and my caller and I can both hear one another. This completely frees up my hands for other stuff, which is a vastly underrated advantage. Very convenient. You can also just relax on the couch and chat without having to position your wrist especially close to your mouth.

Callers can’t tell that you’re talking to them through your watch, so the microphone quality must be good. It’s also painless to transfer your call to your phone, either before or after you pick up. 

**Workouts**

There isn’t much to say here. You launch the workout, it tracks what you accomplished, and the circles fill. I’m not into recording and analyzing every detail of my boring life so I have no interest in this data. However, one item of note is that when a workout is running, glancing at the watch by raising your wrist always shows current workout progress by default (unless you're simultaneously following directions in Maps). I'd prefer to have workouts run invisibly in the background, but this isn't possible.

**Refreshing glances**

3rd-party glances don’t auto-refresh every time you check them and there’s no way to manually refresh them (I tried force touch—it doesn’t work in glances). I suspect—though I’m not positive—that glances only automatically refresh if they haven’t been consulted within *X* minutes (I’m not sure exactly what *X* is, but it’s more than 5).

**Weather bugs**

I’m obsessed with the weather, so this may be more important to me than to you. I’ve noticed some annoying quirks with the weather display on the phone.

The first is that if you haven’t checked your watch for a while, the weather will actually [disappear from your home screen, like so](http://i.imgur.com/ntbdIUz.png). Not only is this ugly, but it forces you stare at your watch for upwards of 10 seconds until it fetches the latest data. This isn’t a bug, but I’d like the watch to automatically ping for the weather at least once an hour and otherwise just leave the last recorded temperature up on the screen until you prompt for a refresh.

Additionally, sometimes the temperature information is inconsistent between [the complication](http://i.imgur.com/c0cUzvk.png), the app, [and the glance](http://i.imgur.com/zqx4mrw.png). If you look at these two screenshots, taken at the same time, you’ll see two different numbers being displayed.

**So what do I think?**

**The killer features**

*The* killer feature is turn-by-turn haptic directions. After a week-long learning curve, I can recognize the taps for left turn and right turn and am able to navigate by feeling alone *so long as I can feel the taps* (which is basically only when I’m walking). If I ever have a doubt, I can tilt my wrist up and see the upcoming turn. This represents a drastic improvement over the old way of navigating by smartphone. I love it. It’s also a real opportunity for Apple to leapfrog Google Maps, should they choose to seize it. For the first time in 3 years, I started using Apple Maps over Google Maps and I didn’t think anything would make me switch. However, the superiority of this new format only underlines the weakness of Apple Maps’ data. Maps are downright bad, routing is unintelligent and in some cases (like when you’re on a bike) they’re even dangerous when they direct you to take major thoroughfares instead of streets with separated bike lanes. I really hope Apple will double down on the quality of their maps and add sorely-needed features like public transit and bike routes. If they did, I wouldn’t look back. 

Unfortunately, this feature is made a lot less killer by my problems with the haptic motor (see above).

Note: turn-by-turn haptic directions turn off if a workout is running in the background. You can still check the upcoming turn at a glance but the watch won’t tap you. I hope this is a bug rather than a deliberate choice, because I can’t see any justification for turning them off.

A second killer feature is notifications on your wrist. After about a week I decided to spend a day without wearing the watch and it made me realize just how often I take my phone out of my pocket to check it. I know this sounds trivial, but believe me when I say that glancing at the watch and taking quick action is a drastically better experience and a real time-saver compared to using the phone.

apple,What if Siri was your voicemail?,"So I had this idea after finding out that voicemail sucks right now. It's managed by your carrier and is set to your number, so if you switch numbers, you lose all your old voicemails. When I switch iPhones, I lose all my voicemails too. So it can be fairly easy to lose all those messages, which is bad because my phone is my work phone and I need to make sure I can keep all of my voicemails.

So what if voicemail was handled by Apple, Siri and iCloud? If someone would call you, Siri would answer your voicemail and basically say:

""Hi Random Person, austinkthompson is unavailable right now. Would you like to leave them a voicemail or would you like me to tell him that you called?""

Then the person calling could just tell your own Siri that you'll leave them a voicemail, or just have Siri warn me that you called. If you say you'll have Siri let me know, Siri could prompt you to talk a little bit about why you called, and Siri would write that down and pop up a notification on my phone that I missed your call and the notification would have the reasoning you told them in the message. Then if I swipe on that notification it automatically starts a call back to you.

It can go further into telling Siri that you'd like to not accept calls right now. Let messages, alerts, and notifications go through, only the phone calls would go through to Siri (depending on your Do Not Disturb settings on who are your Favorites).

Your voicemails would be synced with your iCloud, so you could have your voicemails available on your Mac, on iCloud's website, and have them follow you no matter what phone number you have or if you upgrade to a new phone! Your voicemails are always with you too!

I think it would be cool, but it may be a logistical nightmare. What do you guys think?",146,380,2015-05-07,AAPL,0.05301729217171669,0.9224902391433716,0.024492483586072922

AppleWatch,8 Lessons I've Learned After Two Weeks with the Apple Watch,"1. Put your watch on silent when you are around other people. The whole point of the taptic engine is so that you can be discreetly notified of incoming notifications. Bells, whistles, and ringers coming from your wrist bring unflattering attention to the watch (just like a phone) when you're in public.

2. You should still use your phone. Quick replies are fantastic for the watch, and so is voice dictation if you are on-the-go, have your hands full, or are alone. But longer, more complicated texts are still best suited for a phone with a full keyboard. If you find yourself fiddling with a function of the watch for more than 10 seconds, ask yourself ""would this have been faster/more convenient if I had used my phone?"" This will help guide you to utilize the watch's strengths and know its weaknesses. 

3. Let others bring attention to the watch. Most of the time, it's better if you let other people notice and comment on your watch initially. Feel free to use it in public (except maybe Siri) as much as you want. People will naturally be curious about it because it's something new. Don't be that girl/guy that says ""look what I got!"" unless you're very familiar with the person you're talking to. You'll appear more modest and less bragging this way. 

4. Use Siri sparingly around other people, if at all. Quick Siri commands tend to look more normal than long ones, and Siri will be much more likely to get what you say right (saving you from the embarrassment of repeating yourself). Setting a timer for 30 minutes or a reminder to call your mom when you get home seems to be more appropriate (and sounds much more normal) than saying ""text elizabeth when will you be home question mark I need your keys period"" to your wrist.

5. Use the calendar to get organized. The iPhone, iPad, and MacBook are fantastic devices for adding events and maintaining multiple calendars, but your Apple Watch is the best way to actually USE your calendar in a meaningful way. Being able to view the time of your next appointment, work schedule, dinner reservation, movie, class, or concert with a quick glance at your wrist is incredibly useful. You will find yourself much more organized and less forgetful when you start taking advantage of this feature.

6. Don't use the battery complication. The Apple Watch will make it a full day with normal use. Period. During the first few days with the watch, it's normal to use it extensively and be constantly worried about the battery. But once you develop a rhythm with the watch, the battery percentage actually becomes an unnecessary distraction. Replace the battery complication with something else, and use the battery ""glance"" instead. You'll be happy you did. 

7. Don't check notifications while someone is talking to you. I'm not sure why Nilay Patel was unable to figure this out (or put his watch on silent for that matter) in his Apple Watch review. If you feel a buzz on your wrist while talking to someone, don't worry! It'll still be there when you're done talking.

8. Get a wallet case for your phone. Now you'll only need to grab your phone and keys when leaving your house. Can't find your phone/wallet? Ping it with your watch. Wallet cases on a phone can be burdensome (and less safe) when you're constantly taking it out of your pocket to check notifications. But the watch allows you to keep it safely tucked away in your pocket or bag while remaining connected.

Keep in mind that some of these might not apply to you, because we all use our watches differently.",82,135,2015-05-08,AAPL,0.04613027721643448,0.9239875078201294,0.029882214963436127
apple,iPhone lock screen music controls are so small now,"I don't know which update brought this but I've really been noticing it lately when I'm driving.

This just seems like an inconvenience and a safety hazard.

I have diabetes and typically don't wear a medical alert bracelet. This is because they usually cost me $50-$100 and break after about 6 months of nonstop use. I'm not really crazy about the medical ID emergency feature on the iphone since it's kind of hidden and cumbersome to get access to, compared to a normal bracelet where the information is right in front of you.

Is there a feature/app/complication that provides the same information on the apple watch in an accessible manner?

apple,The problem with Siri on the Apple Watch.,"Mini-rant/first world problem:

I find the audio/visual Siri feedback on the iPhone invaluable; it allows me to carry out a multitude of tasks hands-free with zero hassle. With the Apple Watch however, whilst it's possible to use it hands-free, it's much less intuitive and for a device which is supposed to MORE convenient, this need to be addressed quickly IMO. 

Hear me out: if I want to send a text to my partner, I have to say ""Hey Siri, text X I'm on my way"" and then once transcribed, I have to say ""Hey Siri (again), send"" or press the send button. 

On the iPhone, Siri will ask you ""Shall I send it?"" (or something to that effect) and you can simply respond ""yes"". You don't have to wake Siri a second time by holding the home button or saying ""Hey Siri"" again. It's much more natural. 

Another example, if on the Apple Watch you just say ""Hey Siri, send a message"", Siri will ask who you want to text (via feedback on the screen) but you can't just say the name, you have to say ""Hey Siri (a second time) mum"". THEN, it takes you to the messages app where you're invited to select from a list of predetermined/custom phrases. If you want to dictate your text, you have to either press the microphone button (thus, making the interaction NOT hands-free) or you have to say ""Hey Siri (for a third time!), text mum I'm on my way"", followed by ""Hey Siri (A FOURTH TIME!), send"" which negates all the previous ""Hey Siri"" commands as you could've said this from the outset! Granted, the latter is clearly how Apple wants you to use the feature (and that is fine - I guess) but Siri on the iPhone is much more user friendly and allows for a more natural interaction without the user having to worry about 'doing it right'. That's the beauty of Siri on the iPhone, there is no right or wrong way - it just works. 

The Apple Watch should allow for this type of interaction, after the initial ""Hey Siri"", the watch should continue to listen to the user until the task in question has been completed. Visual feedback is already provided to a degree and audio feedback (via the speaker on the watch) should be there to be toggled on/off as it is in the iPhone. By implementing these changes, Siri would act just as it does on the iPhone, which is to say flawlessly. 

Why Apple decided to implement Siri on the Apple Watch in the way they have done is beyond me.",5,56,2015-05-09,AAPL,0.048298243433237076,0.9197899699211121,0.031911805272102356

apple,My day without the Apple Watch,"With the release of the Apple Watch, I've seen a ton of articles, posts, and comments here on Reddit about typical use, ""day-in-the-life-of,"" ""what it does"" kind of things. I'd like to offer a slightly different perspective. 

As one of the lucky few who received the watch on April 24th, I've  been using it (pretty heavily) for almost three weeks now. I've always been pretty gadget-friendly, so I integrated it into my daily flow as thoroughly as I could. Like some others, it quickly became a regular part of my day. But even as recently as last week, I was still just a little unsure as to whether it was worth the money or not. I mean, I paid $400 for a gadget that was effectively allowing me to ignore the $800 phone in my pocket (an irony that is not wasted on me). Last Saturday was the day that affirmed my decision to buy and my subsequent decision to keep the Apple Watch. 

What happened on Saturday? I accidentally left my watch at home (for the entire day). Now, I'd like to preface the rest of this story with the fact that this was not some traumatic experience. It's not like everything turned a drab shade of gray and I spent the entire day moping because I didn't have my watch (I still had my phone, after all). But it was a very solid lesson in just how much I had integrated the watch into my daily, indeed my minute-by-minute routine. 

What I learned is as followed (summarized in a nice bulleted list for you):

* **The AW helps me answer (or at least have the opportunity to) a lot of phone calls that I otherwise would have missed.** I was trying to help someone car shop that day, and I missed 3 or 4 calls from them at various times despite having my phone on high volume and vibrate in my pocket. 

* **Similarly, the AW delivers texts to me in a manner that allows me to respond in a much more timely manner.** My friends and family get replies from me instantly or a couple of minutes at the latest.

* **I am much better at managing my time when it's on my wrist.** I realize this is a 'watch' thing and not necessarily an 'Apple Watch' thing, but I hadn't worn a watch regularly in the last 15 years prior to the AW. I understand I could take my phone out of my pocket at any moment to check the time, but the point is that I didn't. Having a more precise idea of the time made me more accountable to my deadlines. As with much of this post, YMMV.

* **I was more sedentary** One of the little health benefits of the AW has been in prompting me to get up and move around (or stretch). I work out in the mornings, but during the day I get fairly sedentary. This isn't limited to just work day either. So when I didn't have it that day, I didn't move as much. Not a big deal for a single day, but I got used to those reminders.

* **Little one-off tasks were tedious again.** I'm kind of lazy. It's why I'm so into gadgets. A little effort in setting one up at the outset can provide with hours (or more) of time savings. And so it was with the AW. Even though I *could* pull my phone out and calculate a tip, turn on my lights (perhaps unsurprisingly, I have Philips Hue at home), or send a quick text to my friend asking how close they were to arriving, I often wouldn't. You see, I'm so lazy that even getting my phone out of my pocket, or up off of the table (where I'd often have to reach out into the icy cold abyss of my living room from the warm safety of my blanket, even *gasp* breaking contact with my back and the couch, instantly freezing me to the core) was too much effort. The watch allowed me to avoid these little inconveniences, even if I looked a little ridiculous ducking my head under the covers to issue a voice command.

Was it horrible leaving my watch at home for the day? No. But it was great big fat answer to the personal question of, ""Is it worth it?"" and that answer is a resounding yes. 

The most exciting part of this story is that the best is yet to come. In the not-distant-at-all future. I can see the watch becoming a personal identifier that triggers all sorts of great things in an automated home. Just get me some [IFTTT](www.ifttt.com) integration and all of a sudden, my heater kicks on when I'm 15 minutes from home, the front door unlocks as I get up to it, and the lights turn on (perhaps even as I walk into the room they're in). Could my phone do this? Sure. But what if I don't want the heat to turn on? Just a flick of the wrist and a quick voice command to change it. No fumbling for a phone. No unlocking it (as convenient as TouchID is). No looking for the app. 

**TL;DR:** After owning the watch for three weeks, one day without it was a far better sell than any article, ad, or blog post on the internet *ever* could be.",146,574,2015-05-13,AAPL,0.07005687803030014,0.8993101716041565,0.030632974579930305

apple,"I ordered the 1.3 GHz MacBook a month ago, today I returned it","After a month of waiting for the MacBook, I initiated the return process last night.

Loved the idea of it, ordered it within the first few hours of the online store being up (along with my watch). Custom ordered the 1.3 ghz with 512. Tried it in store once it came to Australia - everything seemed great stress testing in store.

My 1.3 model arrived tuesday. Within the first few hours of using it i decided it wasn't going to work for me. I think the biggest issue is actually my hate of safari.

Actually, if you plan on using 3rd party apps on the MacBook you really start seeing performance drops. I was using VLC (watching game of thrones, a 200 mb file so it wasn't high res or anything), firefox on reddit - so nothing intensive (don't even ask about google chrome) and Microsoft Word typing up something for uni tomorrow, also opened up my lecture notes in Adobe Reader... THINGS GOT SLOW.

Moving Finder windows across the screen there wasn't really a lag... but it wasn't smooth like im used to, its almost like a slight stutter. In Word there were delays opening different windows (e.g. selecting the dropdown font window). Was sitting there for at least 3 secs. Never had to do that before.

I quit everything, and opened up my work in Pages, Preview, QuickTime and Safari and things were much better. I'm just not willing to be limited to OS optimised software.

Decided I can get a mid spec macbook pro 13inch and never have any of these problems - so im going to do that.

I was a massive fan of this laptop from the beginning and im sure it its perfect for some people -- but if you are thinking about it try and use some non-OS apps before you buy it

apple,"Note: The Apple Watch has a pixel density of 326 ppi, NOT 290/302 ppi.","I see people using those numbers everywhere and they're wrong.

What's happening is that people are looking at the resolutions (390x312 and 340x272), they're converting the watch sizes into inches (42mm=1.65"" and 38mm=1.50""), and they're using that to calculate a pixel density of 302 ppi for the larger model and 290 ppi for the smaller model.

**Those calculations are incorrect because 42mm and 38mm correspond to the height of the entire watch face, NOT the diagonal of the AMOLED display. The displays are actually about 1.53"" (~39mm) for the large model and about 1.33"" (~34mm) for the small model.**

If you do the calculations with the actual screen sizes, you get a pixel density of about 325-330 ppi. And seeing as how Apple has been using a standard 326 ppi on so many of its devices since the dawn of the Retina display (iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, 6, iPad Mini 2, Mini 3), I think it's a pretty safe bet that the Watch uses the same 326 ppi. And that's for both the 42mm and 38mm models.

I just thought I'd clear that up, as I see this error everywhere - from board posters to professional tech reviewers. Even the Wikipedia page lists 290 and 302 ppi. Those numbers are wrong. The real pixel density is higher, at about 326 ppi.


**UPDATE:** It has been confirmed. I brought this to the attention of Rene Ritchie and Gruber on Twitter, and Ritchie pointed me to the official Apple [schematics](https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/599397428618493953/photo/1) as a reference. The 38mm model has a screen that measures 21.22mm x 26.52mm. That works out to 326 ppi.

- center my eye above left edge of the screen to line up left edge of caliper.
- center my eye above right edge of the screen to line up right edge of caliper (this is to eliminate parallax error).
- repeat the above two steps to make sure edges still lined up.


(Note: camera is center above right edge, which is why the caliper lines up on the right side while the left edge shows a small gap. This is not an error. If I centered the camera above the left edge, it will visually line up)

AppleWatch,My Smartwatch Rant against negative reviews.,"To start things off, I don't have a Smartwatch of any kind. I'm not a fanboy of apple or android, I haven't ordered an apple watch at all but I have read and seen a lot of reviews. Many of which are negative. 

Negative reviewers tend to harp on the thought that it isn't worth the high cost of $350+ to be able to marginally improve your life by putting notifications on your wrist. Also, they mention how it always a better experience to scroll through apps on your phone than your Smartwatch such as Instagram and Facebook because obviously the screen is bigger, so why be lazy and just pull out your phone. 

When reviewers nag about things like this, it drives me CRAZY. It isn't just no name people saying these things. Sites like the Verge and other large media outlets talk about issues like this, but they are all completely missing the point. 

Let's put things simply. Imagine a watch; any watch. Imagine one that has a leather band and tells time. Just a normal typical watch. Imagine it costs $350. Ok got it? A $350 watch. Let's call it a Movado.

Now let's imagine that Movado with a $350 price tag in a glass case at a Macy's and you're shopping for watches. You can buy it, put it on your wrist and tell time on your wrist from now on. Great! This isn't a strange idea right? The watch industry is a multi billion dollar industry that has lasted for centuries. 

Now imagine that as you are browsing, you notice that next to this $350 Movado is a $350 Apple. That watch also will tell time from your wrist. But it will also alert you to your texts, emails, social media, call a cab and even take phone calls for you. 

So now you think: ""Hmmmm watch A tells time but watch B tells time and does all these other things."" With this I ask, is it so controversial a thought that the shopper would want to go with option B? NO! 

Of course it isn't worth it to pay $350+ dollars to save the time to pull out your phone from your pocket. But is it worth the $350 to buy a watch that also reads your texts? HELL YES! Because it's already been worth it for centuries seeing as people spend far beyond that just to tell the damned time. 

Devils Advocate: ""But OP you don't have to charge a Movado every night"" 

My answer: Do you wear your watch to sleep? How hard is it to place the watch on a specific charging pad as opposed to another square inch of space on your night stand? Problem
Solved. Bam! 

With this mode of thinking it basically makes it 100% worth it to get an apple watch.....if you're shopping for a watch.

AppleWatch,"Got myself into trouble at the Apple Store today, but got rewarded","So I walked into my local Apple Store today because I heard Watch bands were beginning to be stocked. When I arrived I saw they had all colors of the sport band, in which I was looking for. I grabbed both the white and blue to go and decide which looked better on my SGS at the try-on station. I also saw they had the charging cable and asked the store manager who was right next to me if the charger was the white plastic that came with the Sport, or the stainless steel that came with the Watch. He did not know, so he decided to open the package himself so we could both see. It was indeed stainless which was nice to know. He then followed me over to the try on station along with several employees who all crowded around to see the end result of the bands on a SGS. 

They ooh and ahh'd at both colors and suggested both. Which I was expecting to purchase anyways. That is when the store manager pipes up and asks if I also want to purchase the charging cable at half-price since they could not sell it anyways seeing the packaging had been opened. I was stoked to hear the offer and told him sure! 

That's when I decided to try my luck, and explained to the store manager that my black sports band that came with my watch had been losing its soft finish and that I had a case open with Apple support over the phone for a band exchange. Before I could even finish my question, he exclaimed ""Sure, we can exchange that for you in store"" I couldn't believe it. This guy was my new best friend!

In the end, I left with 3 new bands a stainless steel charging cable all for $121.00! 

TL;DR: Apple is one of the greatest companies with some of the best customer support!

apple,[Long Post] My experiences with a MacBook Pro vs a high-end Windows ultrabook,"I was in need of a new laptop urgently, so I looked online for what was available within my price range (between £1000 and £2000). Everything online pointed to the Retina MacBook Pro from Apple and the Dell XPS 13/15, often inconclusively. Therefore, I decided to draw my own conclusions and purchased both (going with the 13"" rMBP and 15"" XPS [XPS 15]) with the intent of getting a refund on the less favourable one. What follows are my general experiences with the two, and which one I settled on.

EDIT: The Dell has 16GB of RAM, a Haswell i7 and a 512GB SSD with a 4K display. The rMBP has 16 GB of RAM, a Broadwell i7 and a 512GB SSD.

Both laptops look absolutely gorgeous, they are both aluminium but the XPS uses a darker shade which serves to differentiate between Apple's design quite well. I probably don't need to tell you guys what and rMBP looks like. One thing I noticed was that Dell went with a rubbery interior, which was incredibly prone to collecting fingerprint oils and the touchpad was also made out of the same material unlike the glass on the rMBP.

**Touchpad**

The touchpad on both laptops were very large to accommodate gestures and multitouch. However, the scrolling performance on the Dell was actually quite shockingly bad as the scrolling acceleration was incredibly touchy and occasionally the whole touchpad would stop working properly and have to be cleaned. I was thoroughly impressed by the pressure sensitive touchpad on the rMBP because of it's Force touch features and being made out of glass, it seemed to me like it was less prone to freezing at least. The Apple touchpad is very good at emulating a clicks, and it's trippy to press on it with the laptop turned off.

**Touch screen**

The Dell has one. It didn't work on first boot, but after that it was actually really good. Windows 8.1 works very well with touch screens.  I don't understand Apple's aversion to them. It's a nice feature to have.

**Boot Camp**

As somebody who had never used OS X before, I immediately decided to install Windows 8.1 with boot camp on the rMBP as I had heard all the hype about how ""Macs are the best Windows PCs"". However, I was thoroughly shocked by the touchpad driver for Windows. It didn't support natural scrolling which the Dell did, and scrolling performance was even worse than the low end HP laptop with a normal button multitouch touchpad that I was upgrading from. I fixed the scrolling direction with a registry tweak, but it was still disappointing to see that there was basically no scrolling acceleration and the scrolling gesture acted more like a virtual mouse wheel than like on OS X where the page scrolls smoothly based on your finger movements. I also heard of trackpad++ but was not interested after seeing that the driver installation was hard to revert and required turning off signature enforcement and the driver had to be ""validated"" every week or would stop working. Needless to say, I gave up on boot camp and reverted back to using purely OS X.

**WiFi**

This was another aspect that was truly shocking. After years of using Windows laptops, I had never realised how horrendous the wireless antennas actually were! Here are the two speed tests, with both laptops sitting side by side 25 meters from the access point, and a theoretical speed limit of 76Mbps.

http://www.speedtest.net/result/4380096042.png - rMBP

http://www.speedtest.net/result/4380147475.png - Dell

As you can see, WiFi on the Dell (which was no better than any of my previous laptops) was truly awful in comparison to the MacBook Pro. There must be something wrong, why is the Dell laptop WiFi so terrible? Ping times were faster on the rMBP and the download speed was nearly 5 times greater.

***EDIT***: Here are the screenshots of the Windows and Mac WiFi details panels since some of you wanted a better test, showing the link speeds. As you can see, it's not a problem with the speediest.net server. I was trying to play a 4K Netflix video in the background for both to try and prevent both machines from dropping the speed to save power. I could not get the Dell to get a faster data rate no matter what I did.

**Disk performance**

The SSD on the rMBP is godly. There is no competition. 1300MB/s? This is madness! The Dell also has an SSD, although it isn't as fast. There is basically no actual difference in day to day use.

**Touches**

I like the fact that the Dell includes a little button with LEDs on the side to check current battery levels, but I could have sworn that this used to be a MBP feature a few years ago as I recall seeing it in an Apple store. 

Why has nobody else implemented the one-hand opening hinge from the MacBook Pro? It's really useful and the hinge still somehow maintains stiffness and doesn't wobble or anything.

The keys on the keyboards for both laptops are very tactile and nice to type on, but the Apple keyboard seems to have a bit more travel. I found Apple's keyboard difficult initially. Why is there no forward-delete button? Why is the ""British Apple Keyboard"" so different from basically every British keyboard ever? All off the keyboard shortcuts I'm used to are different in OS X. How to I permanently delete a file without running it through the trash bin? Needless to say, after a few days I got used to all of these quirks.

The speakers on both laptops are genuinely amazing, taking into account their size. I could get by with both laptop speakers without having anything external since I'm no audiophile and they sound fine for me.

**Added EDIT: Battery**

Both laptops come with an advertised 11 hours of battery, and I think both companies are being truthful since I do get at least upwards of 10 hours per charge on both. 

**Added EDIT: Display**

The Dell has a gorgeous 4K display, which is let down by lacklustre support for display scaling in Win32 software. The rMBP's retina display is also very good, although not as high density. To be honest, I can't really tell the difference between the two, and I'm not a professional graphic designer or video editor, so I do not know much about colour accuracy.

**Conclusion**

I think I'm going to give the Dell back. The touchpad and WiFi were more than enough of an exchange for familiarity and Windows. Windows laptops are definitely getting a lot better than they were just a couple of years ago with design, but the touchpad is a major bottleneck that needs to be sorted out. I don't even know what was going on with the WiFi.

edit: Okay seems that the limit is 100 people per album. 31 are added with 18 more invited. If I reach the limit I'll just duplicate the album and mirror the activity on both.

edit 2: Okay guys, never thought senpai would notice me this much! I had to go run some errands but I'm back. Just have 69 (heh) new invites to send. Since I already have over 100 total I made a new album. It is the same pictures and everything but it's called ""iPhone Wallpapers 2"". Hope that's alright with you guys. And due to me passing 100 upvotes a bit ago I made both of them open so you can add your own. I will remove any that are either to small, taken from a potato, or to vulgar. But I trust you guys! Oh, and also duplicates will be taken off. Okay off to send more invites! Thanks so much for the support of this second-hand idea!

edit 3: Just finished like 100 more. Hope there were no issues. Just keep sending if you wish, I will send all the invites I can. If I have to make a 3rd duplicate I will, glad it barely takes up space since it's iCloud based. This is only my 3rd post on reddit and the highest voted I think I'll ever get. Thank you guys so much!

Quick Note: If they look kinda similar to a certain degree I'll do my best to pick the best of the 2 or of the group. So we can have variety and the numbers too!

edit 4: Okay there is now 169 photos in each album. They are the same ones to make it fair but I think after a while I'll let them be their own but keep the variety and quality aspect consistent throughout.

apple,Just swapped a BT 4.0 adapter into a late-2011 MBP,"A month ago, I saw the news of the new Logitech MX Master - a refresh (finally!) of the excellent MX line of mice. I've long wanted a BlueTooth-compatible Logitech mouse for my MacBook Pro, since I can't keep a unifying adapter in a USB port and still use a Henge dock.

I ordered the MX Master, received it (whoa, great build quality!)... and promptly learned that I couldn't use it with my late-2011 MBP, which doesn't have a BT 4.0 adapter.

The thought came to mind about dropping in a new BlueTooth adapter. I've performed some other upgrades - an SSD, more memory - but wasn't sure about replacing a PCB that's not really meant to be swapped out. I did some research on iFixit, found a page encouraging the project, and decided to give it a shot.

The first step was acquiring the replacement adapter (a BCM94331PCIEBT4CAX) - not easy, since they seem to be in short supply; Amazon's stock is ""not available,"" and prices on eBay vary over an extreme range. At length, I found one and received it a few weeks later.

When I opened my notebook, I noticed some significant differences from the iFixit guide. First, the entire BlueTooth adapter assembly is taped over with thick black tape. It doesn't look like it's there for thermal conduction - just to hold it in place (and maybe to reflect tampering, for warranty purposes) - so I peeled it off.

Below the tape, the BlueTooth adapter is embedded within [a little plastic caddy](http://2computerguys.com/images/OEM-Original-MacBook-Pro-13-A1278-2009-2010-WiFi-Bluetooth-Bracket_1.jpg), with a set of tiny circular connectors. Haven't seen anything like them before. This little caddy is quite impressive, actually: the cables are precisely positioned in a certain order and held in place. Definitely a refreshing change from the sloppy mess of spaghetti that I'm accustomed to encountering. A very good example of Apple's [""paint the back of the fence""](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/) philosophy here.

I popped off the connectors and unbolted the caddy, and then had to remove tape holding the BT adapter into the caddy - this one had some silvery material on the inside that might *actually* be for heat management, so I saved it. I unbolted the adapter and noticed a tab of gummy material between the adapter and the caddy - *definitely* some type of thermal paste.

Time to put it all back together. I swapped the thermal gummy tab over to the new adapter, bolted the new adapter into the caddy, bolted the caddy back into the chassis, reconnected all of the cables (note: they *have* to go back in the same order to fit into the caddy), and packaged it back up. Turned on the MBP, headed straight to the BlueTooth ""Add Device"" panel, and held my breath...

After a few seconds, the MX Master showed up in the new devices panel. It's now working swimmingly with my MBP.

apple,"The future of BetterTouchTool: Ideas, Suggestions etc.?","Hi!

I’m posting here because I noticed that many BetterTouchTool users are in /r/apple.
I’m the developer of BTT and am currently planning the next steps for BetterTouchTool. This is why I would like to get your input. As you may have noticed I don’t have as much time for BetterTouchTool as a few years ago during my studies (got a real job now and keep BTT as a side project ;-)). This makes it more important for me to focus on what’s important.

So a few questions:

- Do you think I should remove Leap Motion support from BTT? Is anybody still using the Leap? 
The Leap support in BTT is pretty outdated and I would have to update it quite a bit…
There are also other things like MYO that would be cool, but would also be a lot of work to support well. Maybe I should publish some documentation about how to write plugins for BTT?

- Should I focus on improving existing gestures etc., or on adding new stuff?

- Is there something that you are currently missing in BTT?

- Do you have any other suggestions or ideas for BTT?

In general my highest priority currently is to make BTT more stable and fix remaining crashes/bugs. Additionally the Force Touch Trackpads are really cool and there are many opportunities to improve existing and create new gestures for those trackpads. (Version 0.9999 now has the first Force Touch support and I added some basic Force Touch gestures).

I know the UI is not very intuitive, but it is easy to maintain for me, so I’m not planning big changes here (but I’m working on small improvements). Also open sourcing BTT is currently not an option, sorry!

Best,
Andreas

apple,My Apple Store adventure.,"So I see these posts all the time and have never been on the receiving end of apple Magic. Having spent the last 5 years in North Carolina the closest Apple Store was In Raleigh, a mere 3 hour drive. It was always packed like no other store in the mall. I attempted to get something fixed once and felt like I was inconveniencing everyone involved. So I swore off Apple retail for a while. 


Well recently I moved to Southern California and realized that there were 3 Apple stores within a 20 mile radius. I made an appointment to get my 2011 MBP's graphics card issue fixed. While I was sitting at the bar waiting for the tech to look at my laptop I had my iPhone 6+ out. My 6+ has had a slight bend in it since last December, but I really didn't care all that much it just rocks slightly when laying on a flat surface, I kinda rock it absent mindedly  while waiting for something. So naturally I was playing with my bent phone and a tech notices what I am doing. He asks to take a look at my phone. He notices instantly that it's bent and asks me if I want him to swap it out. I seriously couldn't believe it, he opens up a new ticket and before my original issue was fixed I had a new $1000 phone in my pocket. 


This solidified my belief in this brand. I'm sure everyone's experience isn't going to be like this. Honestly I would have been fine with a bent phone but this was above and beyond.",169,416,2015-05-28,AAPL,0.021797889843583107,0.9177350997924805,0.06046701967716217

apple,"I'm Speaking Out as a Concerned Developer about the current iOS App Store Rankings, Spam on Nearly Every Keyword, Good Apps Being Buried","http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2rxfkk &lt;-- I had to use DailyMotion because YouTube kept getting stuck processing.

This is my first post on this sub, but I am a longtime lurker and iOS enthusiast since iOS 1.0. I've been developing what I believe are decent apps for the past year, and I am just disappointed by how hard it is to get visibility in the App Store against a backdrop of just complete crap spam apps. I showcase a few examples of this in my video. I don't mean to come across as a ""sore loser"" or anything, I just honestly think this is being majorly overlooked by Apple and I'd like to see this change. I could care less if I have success on the App Store or not, but I feel bad for all the developers out there grinding hard and not getting any visibility because some punk spammers are showing up well above you. APPLE PUT A STOP TO THIS! Please post your stories if you have some as a user or developer. I can't believe the current state of the App Store right now. It's pitiful. I'm going to go to WWDC as a visitor and ask other developers about this face-to-face, because I honestly can't believe the rankings I'm seeing.

EDIT: I shouldn't have called out the MyWeather meteorology app. That was done in haste. Please don't get hung up on that. The vital points in my video about the spam are 1/3 through onward IMHO. That being said, Apple should require a screenshot of the EARTHQUAKE functionality in the store if the app provides that service. The screenshot does not match with the search term.

apple,"Apple reseller lied to me about water damage in my macbook pro, what do I do?","Hello /r/apple

I present to you one of the most annoying situations I have ever been in regarding an apple product and their customer service:

I own a first-gen mid 2012 15"" retina MPB which I have only had issues with. It was a victim of the ghosting issue that affected a lot of those first-gen machines. I live in Belgium, we have no Apple Store here, we only have ""authorized resellers"" and their service/reputation is really bad. They refused to take care of my ghosting issue when my machine was still under warranty, I battled to get it fixed and finally succeeded by taking it to an Apple store in Germany (seriously?)

Shortly after the one year warranty ended, more signs of failure started to show:

1. the battery capacity was down to 50% after only 500 cycles

2. the anti-reflective coating started to come off the screen (http://www.staingate.org)

3. the aluminium case started to corrode on the palm rests (known issue, caused by skin oils)

4. at some point the machine lost its software serial number, so i wasn't able to use iMessage anymore



After two years of use the machine began to suffer from more and more heavy graphical glitches, ranging from light background noise, flashing white individual pixels to heavy distortion when switching between fullscreen interfaces. All of this ending with the internal screen being completely messed up and not even recognised by the machine anymore (http://imgur.com/gallery/zLECpav)

Since this model is supposed to be covered by the ""MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues"" (https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/) I thought I could just drop it off at one of these resellers.
But after one month of waiting (!) they claimed that my machine had suffered water damage and so it wasn't covered by that warranty extension. They presented me with a repair cost of 1800€ for replacing basically every component of the machine, which is completely ridiculous since this is a logic board issue, and not a screen, battery or fan issue.

So I got my broken machine back, did some research about the Liquid Contact Indicators Apple uses to determine water damage, found out their location in my machine (there are 10, some hidden under cables), opened the machine up (without voiding the ""warranty""), found all ten LCIs, they were all white, negative, no water damage. (I took pictures too)

What the hell?

But the weirdest thing is that after putting the lid back on the machine, it booted up and started functioning normally, with still some minor graphical glitches remaining. (flashing white pixels, fullscreen distortion)
 
So now I have:

1. A half broken machine which I can't trust

2. Three months left of theoretical warranty extension for video issues

3. An Apple reseller who lies to me about water damage

4. Proof that my machine hasn't suffered from water damage

What do I do?

**TL;DR; Went to a Belgian Apple reseller to have my rMBP repaired under warranty extension, they claimed water damage, I opened the machine up, all ten liquid contact indicators showed no sign of water touching the Macbook, they lied to me**",59,186,2015-05-31,AAPL,0.13077951967716217,0.8373939990997314,0.031826429069042206
