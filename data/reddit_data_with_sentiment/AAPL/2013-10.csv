ios,iOS7 deleting contacts after I recieve text message,"Hey there,

So I updated to iOS 7, have an iPhone 4S. Am encountering a problem that I haven't seen anywhere else. Basically when I recieve a text from someone it sometimes randomly decides to delete their 'contact' from my list. I still have their number from recieving the text so I can easily just add them again, but it's definitely annoying.

People I text regularly it doesn't seem to happen to, so I thought it maybe just did it once per person or something, but today it deleted someone for the second time so now I'm not so sure.

mac,Universal Google Play Music controls,"Hi everybody. I've been using a MBP for about a year now and have been loving it in general, but one thing that has been bugging me is the inability to control my Google Music with hotkeys. So, to solve this problem I've cobbled together some scripts in Automator that make this possible!

Currently you can use these scripts to play/pause, advance to the next track, and return to the previous track.

Play/pause:
     
    on run
	tell application ""Google Chrome""
		set allWins to every window
		set allTabs to {}
		repeat with currWin in allWins
			set allTabs to allTabs &amp; every tab of currWin
		end repeat
		repeat with currTab in allTabs
			try
				if ((characters -24 thru -1 of (title of currTab as string)) as string) = ""My Library - Google Play"" then set musicTab to currTab
			end try
		end repeat
		tell musicTab to execute javascript ""SJBpost('playPause');""
	end tell
    end run

Next track:

    on run
	tell application ""Google Chrome""
		set allWins to every window
		set allTabs to {}
		repeat with currWin in allWins
			set allTabs to allTabs &amp; every tab of currWin
		end repeat
		repeat with currTab in allTabs
			try
				if ((characters -24 thru -1 of (title of currTab as string)) as string) = ""My Library - Google Play"" then set musicTab to currTab
			end try
		end repeat
		tell musicTab to execute javascript ""SJBpost('nextSong');""
	end tell
    end run

Previous track:

    on run
	tell application ""Google Chrome""
		set allWins to every window
		set allTabs to {}
		repeat with currWin in allWins
			set allTabs to allTabs &amp; every tab of currWin
		end repeat
		repeat with currTab in allTabs
			try
				if ((characters -24 thru -1 of (title of currTab as string)) as string) = ""My Library - Google Play"" then set musicTab to currTab
			end try
		end repeat
		tell musicTab to execute javascript ""SJBpost('prevSong');""
	end tell
    end run

Note that this works with any version of chrome, and perhaps with other tabbed browsers as well (if you replace ""Google Chrome"" with your browser of choice) although I have not tested it elsewhere. If somebody wants to test this feel free.

Once you have created these scripts and saved them as services in automator, they will show up in the list of services you can bind to keyboard shortcuts in your preferences. Happy listening!",0.0,9,2013-10-03,AAPL,0.052813977003097534,0.9182627201080322,0.02892330288887024

iphone,First thoughts after switching,"I just switched to the iPhone 5s from a Nokia Lumia 900 (windows phone) yesterday and have been using it for close to 24 hours now. From what I've seen so far, the iOS platform is vasty more mature than the WP platform. 

* Deeper integration with apps
* far superior multitasking with better app resume. you don't start from the beginning when launching an app from the icon
* Better notification center
* Control center

Several slight gripes though

* Keyboard on WP was superior. Tapping words to select and replace was much faster. Shifting caused the entire keyboard to change characters from lowercase to uppercase. Much easier to see when caps or not. Double tap shift for caps lock. ~~Emoticons subkeyboard was nice.~~
* Tap to hold paradigm isn't in iO7.. usually. Sometimes it exists, but usually it seems swiping does things, but not always. Swiping emails to the left allows me to delete and mark as read, deleting texts requires me to hit an edit button and mark for delete. Wut? 

That's basically it though. I can live with those minor issues. Hopefully in the next few months most of the apps I use now will get an iOS7 interface facelift.

But alas, the ""Samsung is king innovator"" circle jerk was in full swing (wow, such innovation, curved screen, samsung iz king, korean power, watch crapple copy this in there next iShit phonez, samsung iz innovation incarnate, specs make the phone ultra supreme overlord of life, these big numbers is giving be a S-Boner... etc.) and I knew that my poor, honest question would get lost in desolated corner of the comments page. So I figured I would ask somewhere else. Why do we need / want curved smartphones? What advantages would there be from a curved screen?

Here are alternatives.","[The news](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/11/att-does-away-with-per-device-data-plans-for-new-customers). An individual plan with 2GB of data will now cost $95. I thought some of you in the US will be affected so I decided to make a short post. Here are alternatives:


* [AIO Wireless](www.aiowireless.com), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T. The data connection is unfortunately throttled at 8Mbps, still it's not bad. A plan with 2GB of data costs $55.
* [Straight Talk has recently adopted a new policy ](http://www.phonenews.com/straighttalk-and-net10-officially-adopt-more-transparent-data-policies-24027/) of capping data at 2.5GB instead of claiming they offer ""unlimited"". [They also started to offer LTE](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/13/4727886/straight-talk-prepaid-now-works-with-att-lte-devices).
* [GoPhone now supports smartphones including iPhone](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57586055-94/at-ts-gophone-prepaid-service-adds-4g-support/). For $60 a month you get 2GB of data that is not throttled.

edit:
I got it working!! I guess absolute paths dont work in cron.. or at least you have to do something special to specify them. So what i had to do was change my crontab to assume it was being executed from the home directory, and ALSO change my shell script it assume it was being executed from the home directory (even though it was actually in a folder on the desktop) and that worked!
so the crontab was:

apple,"iCloud services, specifically email.","I have Apple devices (iPhone, iPad) for personal and my business and I've always had an Apple computer as well (up until the past couple of years).

I've always been dependant on Google services for years. For my calendar, multiple e-mails (which all forward to one gmail account), etc.

I rarely use Gmail's web interface (Im a native-app kind of guy). Honestly, today I realized how cumbersome gmails ""labels"" and other features are when using IMAP. Also I realized how much I dont need Google Calendar when I don't even use any of its online features.

I did my research and read up on the iCloud features, I thought it was awesome. All my family and co-workers use iPhones so the Calendar sharing feature really appealed to me, as well as the syncing for Notes and Reminders. And the integration between iPad and iPhone and then OSX is awesome... all synced on all devices.

With me considering purchasing another Apple computer again, I figured, hell, why not. I started to move my needs over.

I started by registering an iCloud account, I switched my Notes and Calendars over to iCloud and successfully mapped this to my Thunderbird. I also switched my iMessage/Facetime/AppStore/iTunes over to the new address as well. All this was easy.

Now my e-mail. It's huge, years and year worth of business and personal stuff. How can I go about switching to my new iCloud.

I figured the best way would be to leave my old email on Google as an archive for now, and tell Google to forward any mail to my new iCloud. And tell my business account to do the same (my business domain).

**TL;DR**

Which brings me to my question. How reliable is iCloud email? For sending and receiving given I depend on e-mail daily for business use. Anyone have experiences with it? And can I add a ""send from"" alias?

iphone,iPhone 5 home button doesn't respond until second or third press every now and then. Is this a software glitch or hardware issue?,"I'm currently backing up my phone right now in preparation to restore my iPhone as a new device, but am wondering if anyone has encountered this issue. 

I started noticing a few weeks after downloading the 7.0.2 that my home button fails to work every now and then. Whether my phone is in sleep state and I press home to wake it up or if I'm in an app and want to go to my main screen, the home button requires an additional press to work.

Is this something that might be resolved with a restore? Or should I just go straight to Apple about it? There doesn't seem to be any issue with my button being loose or anything.

apple,The iPad 'Air' a foreshadow?,"I haven't seen any discussion on this, but does anyone else think that the new naming convention largely signals the future imminence of an iPad 'Pro' a la the Macbook line? 

I think that if there were an iPad Pro coming, it'd be larger, have TouchID, a keyboard-embedded smart cover and feature larger storage bases (as well as likely chip upgrades etc.).

EDIT: I said this in the comments but it warrants a mention as I've slightly reconsidered what a 'pro' model could be. Namely, I don't think it would be any larger than the 'Air'.

It would have any inclusion of the following potential 'pro' (i.e. Bump ups that matter to professional users and not likely to matter to everyday users) features: 

• Latest camera

• Haptic response

• Sound-dedicated processor (musicians)

• Reduced screen response time (artists)

I use Time Machine on an older G-Drive slim (http://www.g-technology.com/products/g-drive-slim) with USB 2.0 to back up my hard drive frequently.  If something went toally wrong and I had to wipe my HDD, would restoring from Time Machine also restore my Windows partition?  Or should I get an alternate external hard drive to back up my Windows partition?  Basically if anything goes wrong installing Mavericks I want to be able to return to the exact setup that I have now.

iphone,Does anyone have any info on when Google Play Music is supposed to be released on the iPhone?,"Hi, 

I'm switching over to the iPhone for work, and I currently have Google Play Music on my Android device, which I am a big fan of. I know that it is supposed to be released on the iphone, and supposedly soon, but I was wondering if anyone perhaps had a clearer picture of when. I have the $7.99 all access pass, which I'd like to keep if it is coming soon. 

Thanks",14.0,7,2013-10-29,AAPL,0.020614100620150566,0.9119654893875122,0.0674203485250473

iphone,Great. I updated to iOS 7.0.3 and now my wifi doesn't work.,"My iPhone 4s was working fine until I updated to the latest iOS 7.0.3.  Immediately I lost wifi connection and now my iPhone cannot detect my network anymore.  I tried resetting network twice already, but it didn't do anything.  My network is fine, because other devices connect to it just fine.  Rebooted the iPhone couple of times, still nothing.  Anyone have any suggestions?
