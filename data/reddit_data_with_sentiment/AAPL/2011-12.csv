After fruitlessly making a thread about it, redditor klippekort advised me to list it on mark-up.com. Every other person  told me I could forget ever seeing it again. 

Anyway, I got a call about 6 weeks later from a computer technician in Poland. The thief had brought it into his shop to have the OS reinstalled. Tech guy googled the serial number and bang: thousands of dollars worth of stolen goods soon uncovered by police. 

Best part? The crooks signed the MBP up for 3 years of AppleCare.

iphone,What you shouldn't use your iPhone for,"So yesterday I started to do an automatic transmission fluid flush on my Honda Civic.  The garage is somewhat dark so I was using my iPhone as a flashlight.  

So anyway, I jack up one side of the car, put a jack stand underneath the car, then jack up the other side of the car, and put a jack stand underneath that side.

Then I get under the front and I have a hard time seeing so naturally I was using my iPhone.  Found the bolt I needed to unplug, so I put a pan underneath to catch the fluid.  I was trying to remove the bolt but had a hard time fitting the socket wrench into it because I couldn't see.  So I put the iPhone in the pan with the back camera facing up so I could see (using a flashlight app).  I figured I'd just take the phone out after I loosen the bolt.

I finally manage to loosen the bolt......then I proceed to take the bolt out and drain the ATF without taking my phone out of the fucking pan.........for about 10 seconds before I realized what I had done.  It was probably submerged in ATF fluid at that point.  

I panicked and took the phone out and wiped the ATF off of it.  Amazingly, it still works, except the screen is half brownish (see usable though), the speaker is at half strength, and the microphone doesn't work (which means I can't make calls).

Last night I took the whole thing apart and cleaned it as best I know how....still haven't put it together yet because it was taking forever and I had to sleep.

Oh it gets better.  Turns out my roomate has a flash light and I just didn't bother asking.

Moral of the story?  Fuck the flashlight app, just buy a damn flightlight.",39,60,2011-12-05,AAPL,0.05351165682077408,0.9129542708396912,0.03353410214185715

iphone,"Tip: If people are having a hard time understanding you on the phone, buy a can of compressed air.","I bought an iphone 4s the day it came out, and since then, almost everyone I've talked to on the phone has at one point or another during our conversations gone, ""Crouchy? Crouchy? Are you still there? You're breaking up. Crouchy?"" This happens on nearly every call. I almost broke down today and went to the Apple Store to get it replaced, but after looking through forums, google, etc., I came across the following tip:

See that tiny pin hole on the top of the iphone next to the headphone jack? That's the noise canceling mic. As small as it is, it easily collects particles. These particles can screw up the noise cancellation, sometimes causing the phone to cancel your voice. Grab a can of condensed air, and spray directly into the hole. 

Test the phone by re-recording your voice mail greeting and moving the phone around as you're recording your message. And by that I mean sliding the bottom of the phone away from face an inch or so, moving it up or down, emulating what you'd do on a normal phone call, as no one keeps their phones still when they're talking. If you still hear gaps in your message as you're listening to your greeting, re-apply the condensed air, and try again.

I know this seems silly, but it's made my conversations so much clearer.",14,52,2011-12-06,AAPL,0.09892266988754272,0.8741125464439392,0.026964763179421425

apple,DAE feel like the Reddit for iPhone App might need a tiny update?,"Maybe I'm breaking the mod rules a bit, but i guessed this is the only community that will probably feel the same.

My point is that the official Reddit app is really buggy and basic too, compared to the web interface

some of the features that might be added I thought of recently are listed here

* bug fixes. a lot of that shit.
* submitting links and text posts
* view users' profiles
* editing capabilities¨
* more featured landscape view
* getting rid of the upside down rotation view
* mod mail
* search
* friends (although most people don't have any)
* maybe some special custom styles for mobile?

so, tell me r/apple, does anyone else feel like the iphone app needs an update?

EDIT: I know about AlienBlue, but what's the point of making iReddit official if it is so bad?
Either it should give its official title to AlienBlue or update.

iphone,A warning for iMessage users.,"Hello all,

I just wanted to share a warning with you.  I've been using an iPhone in iOS 5 for some time now, and until recently, loved the iMessage feature.  It worked great, saved me money, and was just all around wonderful.

Until I broke my iPhone.

I decided that rather than spend a lot of money to get it fixed, I would switch to a new phone, and ended up getting an Android phone.  The problem?  Apple won't disassociate my phone number from my iMessage account.  This means that when you try to text my number from an iPhone, it sends as an iMessage, which I can't receive because I no longer have an iPhone.  Basically, I can't get text messages any more from most of my friends.

So be warned - if you ever plan on switching to a non-iOS phone (or if you might lose your phone, or if there's any chance you could ever have your phone stolen, etc.) there is a good chance people won't be able to text you anymore.  In the case of the stolen or lost phones, the person who has your phone will get your texts (according to some people, this happens even if you remote wipe the phone).

Now, some people say they've had luck getting iMessage to stop using their phone number if they deactivate it BEFORE switching phones.  It's too late for me to do this, so I don't know for sure if it works.  I just wanted to let you all know so you can possibly avoid the situation I'm in.",128,208,2011-12-21,AAPL,0.15084120631217957,0.823345422744751,0.02581334114074707

I just don't know how else to make apple listen. A polite email surely wouldn't do the trick as I'm sure at least one person has tried before to no avail.

WiFi Syncing

   * Check your router settings:
      * Set the iPad to a static IP
      * Or increase the lease time that an IP is given
   * The Apple support forums have a lot of threads on the greyed out Sync Now button. Check them out for more information, or just Google your specific issue.
   * Sometimes restarting the Apple Mobile Device service helps

Corrupted Data, from crpearce

* Reset all settings won't delete any data, but flushes the cache to bring an iOS device back to nearly out of the box.
* Especially helpful if you need to do a full restore. Reset all settings, then backup. Your backup will be purged of all corruptible data before the restore process.

I just wanted to share that someone on the Apple Support Communities finally posted something that worked as a solution for me.  I don't know whether this will work for anyone (and it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that this even worked for me), but if anyone else has had the same problem, feel free to try it out and see if it works for you.

Here's the directions as they were presented to me:


1. Go to: https://supportprofile.apple.com/MySupportProfile.do
1. Log in if not already logged in.
1. Click on ""edit products""
1. Click on the ""x"" to the right of the product.
1. Click ""unregister""

Almost instantly after I did this, my friend's phone automatically started sending me SMS's instead of iMessages.

I think this proves that it is a quirk of Apple's system (not Verizon or AT&amp;T's, as many were convinced it was) and hopefully they figure out a way to make it more intuitive (or at least train their customer service reps on how to fix it).  At least there's a solution though, and that's all I care about!

I put some in a baggy with my iPhone for 24 hours and when I took it out this morning, absolutely everything works: wifi, calls, apps, headphone jack, camera. I am as happy as can be.
