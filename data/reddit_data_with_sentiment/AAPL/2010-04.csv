apple,Holy shit!  You really won't understand the iPad until you use one.  Prediction: you will see more iPads in the future than iPhones.,"I want to be clear about this, I mocked the device after the announcement out of disappointment.  I was/am upset about Apple creating a walled garden with only approved software, DRM, etc.  I was also upset by the lack of multitasking and a front-facing webcam for video conferencing.  I didn't expect upgradable storage space or replaceable batteries - after all this is Apple - but that just pissed me off too.  After announcement, I was let down and I also was upset at the arrogance (bullshit) of calling a device magical.  For once I felt like an outsider looking in unaffected by Steve's RDF (reality distortion field).  I didn't buy the hype.

Then I spent the weekend with the iPad.  Oh boy!  My mind was changed almost instantly.  This is the device you want to carry around.  Forget the phone, the laptop, the desktop - forget them all.  The size and weight of the iPad were perfect.

In the future, people will carry these instead of laptops.  

We will also have machines connected to huge displays at the home or office for content creation (hey, we already have the 27"" iMac); think Minority Report.  Some will still have laptops (especially frequent travelers), but as productivity apps are created for the iPad, laptops will become less and less necessary.  Of course we will still carry phones, but their screens make them limited by comparison.

After 2 days with the iPad, all I can say is that I have felt the future of consumer/mobile computing.  It is this device, not the iPhone or Ipod that will take center stage.  I think you would buy an iPhone in the future for platform compatibility with the iPad - not the other way around as it is today.  Give it a few years, and everyone will have one of these - just like the iPod.

apple,My renewed faith in Apple.,"I've been an Apple user for about 17 years, and only recently had my faith shaken. My MBP died in the middle of last week amidst a shit storm of nearly due projects. When I say died, I mean when I pressed the power button, the fans would spin, but no chime and no display. My MBP is out of warranty with no applecare (purchased early 2008).

After speaking with Apple on the phone, they decided to send me a box (because I am near no Applestore or authorized repair center) and said that they would fix the graphics processor, and if that didn't solve my problem (we both knew it wouldn't) they'd call me with a quote. I knew I was about to have to pay a lot of money to get my logic board replaced.

The call took place Friday evening, I received my box Saturday morning (how?!). I mailed off the computer Monday afternoon, and had it returned to me fixed Wednesday morning. They replaced the logic board free of charge. The kicker? They also replaced my optical drive, which I hadn't even mentioned to them that I was having problems with.

Thank you, Apple.

apple,"To the moron pushing the current top anti-apple story on reddit, and the idiots joining in.","&gt; Because I feel like getting zero or hundreds of down votes before I go to bed tonight. Apple = AOL for Hipsters. (self.reddit.com)

Starting with ""I know I'll get downvoted but..."", good one. Now you state Apple = AOL, and vague try and say it is because they 'control' things, you don't like the 4.0 SDK, but don't say why, you say jizz and fluffer, which amazes me because the cunts on reddit usually downvote anything with swearing, and then you say ""other companies can't compete with Apple"". How are you saying anything?

&gt; Think about it. Users think the devices are wonderful (iPad, iPhone, iNutsack, iFuckYouInTheAss). And yes they are nice devices.

Think about it... they make good device... that are good. You aren't saying much here.

&gt; But Apple is controlling most of the content and you don't even care (or notice). How does it feel to buy a device that actually fucks you, without lube?

How is apple controlling the content? They have a device that does 10 things, one of them is the web, one of them is running apps from their app store. Are you sad you can't run windows on their device? I am confused, what exactly do you mean they are controlling things?

Tell us what it should do.

&gt; Watching the iPhone 4.0 preview today made me nearly shit myself. Steve is basically nutting on your face and you love it. Wake the fuck up. We should not be eagerly waiting with our mouths open (like jenna haze waiting for a soft cock) for the next push of content or functionality that Stevie or his media boys ""fluffers"" decide to grace you with next.

Can you give just one actually reason why it made you shit yourself? No?

&gt; They should be coming up with great shit (content) that makes you go to them, on your terms. Way to fuck the pooch for the rest of us that actually give a shit. Wipe the fucking Stevie jizz from your eyes and think about what the fuck you are doing. And fuck you preemptively for calling me a troll.

They are, they are making good hardware and an operating system that makes calls and can run apps, and access the web. You can perfectly capable of going to them on your terms.

Perhaps it would be therapeutic for you to list the things that you can't do that you wish you could do, and that will possibly expose that you are an idiot.

&gt; Edit: Let me fix this for people who didn't understand. Apple is rolling with a trend that will hinder innovation in the long run. Period. 

How can a company innovating _ever_ give you licence to accuse them of stifling innovation?

&gt; Sure, other companies will come out with something better and more open, but what investor is going to back them when Apple can guarantee them a shit ton of your money.

So, your second and final point is: Other companies can't compete with Apple, that makes apple bad. Not because they are abusing a monopoly, but they actually made a good device, which was successful.

&gt; Do you really think apple removed DRM from their music for your benefit? Apple, hindering innovation until we think of it...Fuck I'm tired. Stop fucking voting and let this bitch die. There are more important things on the frontpage, like peppers on pizza.

You almost have to actually base your point in some reason, and you give up? This was as close as you got to actually _saying anything_.

This just amuses me because reddit is usually far more sensitive to 'fuck' in comments. I have no fucking idea who is upvoting you though.


&gt; Edit2: Saving you some time. If you are about to post a comment that includes the following words: ""If you have a problem with Apple, don't buy their shit!"" Please don't bother.

&gt; I take this as a sign that 1. You didn't read any of this or my comment history, or

Read any of WHAT? What have you actually SAID except 'Apple controls the content'. What could I possibly read, in those four words, that somehow invalidate the notion that if you don't like iPhone, you don't have to buy it?

Is it because you are trying, but ultimately failing to say 'Apple are so profitable, it stops other companies making open platforms', or is it because, you yourself, do not understand that iPhone is a platform, you just have some vague notion that it is a strong and effective ecosystem that is very hard to compete against with inferior products and services?

&gt; 2. You aren't even close to understanding my point.

What fucking point? You haven't made any point. What the fuck. Who the fuck can possibly possibly fucking upvote this shit and not think, what the fuck, this fucking idiot hasn't even fucking said anything.

What a fucking moron `ball_in_da_mouf` is, I'd never even read or reply to this, but it got so many votes on reddit, it is just furthering this astroturfed campaign to get it trendy to say ""I hate apple"", this happened a few months ago.

Now you have news stories that barely even mention Apple being submitted as ""I hate Apple like everyone else, but read this"". What the fuck reddit. Fucking hell.

apple,"Go fuck yourself, Adobe","Adobe,

I've hated your products for a long time, far longer than I've been a user of Apple products. I've made lists of HUNDREDS of poor design choices you've made in Photoshop, and the last eight years you've done NOTHING improve the extensibility of the product, because that would cost you dearly in upgrades.

Flash has been the bane of my life since its previous evil corp. owner, Macromedia.

Fuck you adobe, for trying to poke sticks at a company for not supporting your platform, and hiding the truth:

Adobe want to wrap the flash runtime, the BROKEN, flash runtime, around flash files.

What would this do? Sure, you'd get 50,000 flash apps uploaded to the app store the next day, and clueless individuals downloading them, and then complaining their iPhones are hot, and their batteries don't last, not to mention installing multiple copies of the same buggy runtime, one for each app. How would this play with multitasking? Huge pauses while the runtime is saved state. In fact how would flash apps save state? Does it even support the 4.0 experience? No. There are reasons we all work together to ensure a fluid user experience between apps, the same reason all websites aim to reinforce the same user expectations, so we all win when people know how to use the web.

_There are reasons_ why flash doesn't load in iPhone, and why it should be thrown away.

Did you see the motherfucking HTML5 iAds? I didn't think I'd ever look forward to mobile advertising, but this looks genuinely win win for developers.

I've never seen anything as responsive and elegant in Flash, AND THIS IS ENTIRELY IN OPEN STANDARDS!

Your ads will run on Android and on iPhone! Without any work!

Flash is over, goodbye flash. I am sick of you flash, because those idiots at Facebook put flash on their site to maintain cookie state even when you delete cookies. Because Flash is responsible for the return of the popunder.

You had a good run, you launched a number of porn sites, well done. badgerbadgerbadger2.com will be HTML5, you can go fuck off now adobe.

Trying to politicize a _technical_ issue is pathetic, then, **so it having people put in prison to cover your shitty programming and thieving business practices**.

Not to mention the years of frozen-browser-PDF-lupus-syndrome. Suck it Adobe, you can't cry yourself better software, and you can't expect people to put up with your shitty products dictating a large percentage of their users experience. Fuck you Adobe, fuck you hard, and fuck off.

Adobe are shit, they can fuck off.

It's code may have been ""elegant"" but it was also not done! 

But Apple took the open source Konqueror, and made their own ""WebKit"" toolkit out of it. And once they did, and made it into a respectable browser (Apple Safari) an explosion occurred! Suddenly, WebKit is found on everything Apple, Chrome, Android, Blackberry, Palm, and just about everything but Firefox and IE!

Note, I have considered an iMac, those screens are amazing.  However my current laptop is on its last legs and I really must have something more portable than a 27 inch monster.

For what it's worth, I am looking at a mid-level 15 inch MBP.

Help?

Edit, a few questions I do know to ask:

I guess the biggest questions are how functional is the machine straight out of the box? I understand it has iMovie, but I don't know how robust that program is or if there is any similarity to Final Cut.

Do you recommend any other software at the time of purchase?

Is the Applecare extended warranty a worthwhile purchase?

Does anyone use MobileMe? Is that a worthwhile purchase?

apple,I'm trying Opera Mini for iPhone right now. I am dissapoint.,"Underwhelmed would be the more appropriate word.

It really is super fast, no question about it.

However, every single interface convention is broken. Zooming in is confusing, typing in information is not intuitive, dragging the image is strange to do, and even managing the favorites looks weird.

It is a good first try, and I think they didn't really thought it through because they weren't expecting Apple's approval, but other than speed, there really is no point in downloading the app. And usually when you have to look something up in Safari, speed isn't crucial. There is an app for almost anything else, and having the app speeds up data retrieval. This isn't a revolutionary app. This is a poorly made ""me too"" app. Worse yet, there isn't even a way to set it as a default browser, so you're going to be using Safari for many things anyway...

The app is free, so you can try it for yourself. You don't have to believe me. But, really, this isn't an app worth your time.",23,16,2010-04-13,AAPL,0.04004138708114624,0.9222434163093567,0.03771522268652916

iphone,Beta Cake for all redditors*,"Well, in light of the fact that there seem to be a lot of scammers, I figured I'd do this for this community.

Basically, if you want to use the 4.0 beta (I cannot provide this for you), you need your UDID to be approved or you can go a roundabout way of bypassing stuff (which I'm not going to bother mentioning here). 

If you want your UDID approved, PM me and I'll add it to my approved devices list. The rest is up to you. I'm doing this for **free**.

If I don't respond quickly enough about adding you to my list, it's probably due to me studying for my finals. Don't worry, as long as you meet the requirements and I have space, I'll add you.


*As all offers must have a clause, here is mine: I'll only add you if you've been a redditor for &gt;1 month. Exceptions will be made based upon my discretion.*

*****
EDIT: Just as a note, if you are participating in app testing with another developer, you don't need to be put on a list. Your device is are already approved for the beta. Just find it and install it. Bear this in mind before messaging me, that way more people can have the opportunity.

*****
EDIT2: Wow, this is an overwhelming response. Please bear with me while I slowly add you people. 

It seems like people really want to donate -_-. **I really don't want to do this for the money, think of it as a present to the community on my reddit birthday**. The entire purpose of this was so that people don't get scammed by someone. 

If you want to give me money though, I'm not going to say no, so if you desperately want to, then message me.
Also, the developer site is down for updating at the moment, so it looks like a new beta is going to be out soon.

EDIT 3: False alarm, just iTunes windows drivers for 4.0.

apple,"Why I'll put up with the ""evil"" Apple closed system.","** Manufacturers of Windows PCs **

My mother recently bought a Toshiba laptop.  She didn't want to go with a Mac because the interface was unfamiliar, and as she's not very computer literate it was probably the right choice - no-one runs basic Mac-based computer skill courses.

So, I pull this Toshiba out of it's box and turn it on.  It does the generic ""restoring to out of box state thing, setting up and installing Windows 7.""  ***For three fucking hours.*** 

I kid you not, this thing restarted *at least* 20 times in the process.  Why?  To install Toshiba bloatware.  Bloatware that I spent then next 40 minutes uninstalling because the laptop took nearly 9 minutes to become responsive after first boot.  This narrowed to a blindingly fast 5 minutes after a restart.

Toshiba also decided that my mother would like Norton, so uninstalling that was the next on the list.  Installing a firewall and Avira came next.  All up, around 5 fucking hours to get the laptop to a useable state.  


*Note: This is including the FIRST time I tried set it up; the bloatware installation caused it to crash after about an hour.*


When I bought my iMac and MacBook, I think it was around four minutes from bootup to use.  And that's including me staring in rapt fascination at the ""galaxy first-boot"" animation saying hello in every language except Latin.

Once all that bullshit was dealt with on the Toshiba, however, Windows 7 was an absolute joy to use, and I honestly think Apple would be wise to take note of what Microsoft has done with their latest baby.  The hardware, too, was more than adequate for what was paid and quite nippy.  

For all the mud flung at the Iron Fist of Apple™, I believe it does more good than harm most of the time.

**TLDR:**

The Iron Fist of Apple™ isn't all bad: It keeps quality to a minimum standard.

apple,"Hey Reddit, if you're a filmmaker and iPhone user, and like free apps, then grab a promo code for one of my apps here.","Hi all, I wanted to offer some promo codes for my iPhone apps KeeMe and Filmmakers Dictionary. KeeMe is an app for filmmakers who would like to shoot an iPhone, and then composite new footage onto the device's screen in post production. Basically, it allows you to set a matte color as well as digital tracking markers that can then be keyed and tracked in post production. As you'd imagine, Filmmakers Dictionary is a dictionary of film terms that young filmmakers should learn before they set foot on set.

I'm currently putting together ideas for iPad versions, so I'd love any feedback or suggestions. Thanks, and enjoy!

apple,"Hey reddit, anyone get the new Macbook Pros yet? Any overheating issues?","Hey r/apple, anyone out there have the new 2010 Macbook Pro? I'm considering getting the 15"" i7 MBP model. However, [this article](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/26/core-i7-equipped-macbook-pro-hits-100-degrees-celsius-your-lap/) worries me. The article claims they only tried it with one 17"" MBP i7 model. Does anyone have one and experience these crazy overheating issues? I suppose I could just be adventurous and get one anyway, relying on Applecare when it overheats. But before I pull the trigger I was hoping anyone here had any anecdotes that you have or haven't experienced this issue so far.

I wanted the MBP for the optional portability over an iMac. I'm a graphic designer and would probably be using some graphically intense programs from time to time. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!
