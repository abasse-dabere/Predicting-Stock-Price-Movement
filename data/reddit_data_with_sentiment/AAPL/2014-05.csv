apple,Apple doesn't need to create a search engine to hurt Google,"So the other day [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/24ajdn/crazy_rumour_suggests_apple_will_use_a/) suggested that Apple may be building a search engine for the purpose of attacking Google directly where their profits come from.

Apple has [definitely been hiring people with search experience recently](
http://9to5mac.com/2014/04/07/amazon-a9s-vp-of-search-heads-to-apple-to-fix-up-maps-search/) so it's clear they're working on search technology (and likely have been for [some time](http://techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/is-apple-building-a-search-engine/)). It's clear they intend to use the technology to bolster their current services (App Store, Maps, Siri, etc.) but whether or not Apple wants to create a web search engine is another question. I personally find it unlikely that Apple would want to invest the resources to create their own web search engine, the 'why' of which I'll get into.

Take a look at Google's quarterly results and you'll see declining profitability of Google's ads via their cost per click metric (CPC, the amount advertisers are paying per click). CPC has been declining for about 9 or 10 quarters in a row now, Google's profits are up because aggregate clicks are up; they're essentially making it up in volume. Google has been aggressively monetizing their products and creating ad inventory in order to counter the declining profitability. Why is CPC declining? It's because computing is increasingly being done on mobile devices where users click ads much less and because the smaller form factor limits the types of advertising inventory you can create and market to advertisers. So if hurting Google is in fact the argument being made as to why Apple would/should create a search engine, there are much easier and arguably higher impact ways to accomplish that. 

The first is to simply sell more iPhones and iPads. The disruption of Google's business started in 2008 when Apple introduced the iPhone and ushered in the post-pc world (I use the term post-pc in the way Steve Jobs meant it, that PCs will become the trucks of the computing world where as smartphones and tablets would be the cars). The second is to sell the contract for default search engine on Apple products to Yahoo or Microsoft, thereby denying Google of a wealthier and more engaged demographic. That would have a direct impact on their data collection, but also on the prices they can command from advertisers. I've been trying out Bing for about a month now on my Macbook, and beyond the user interface difference, I cannot tell the difference in the quality of the results. So that would certainly be a feasible option for Apple. Finally Apple can simply ""back"" Facebook in a more comprehensive way beyond their current relationship. Facebook has been dominating in mobile advertising and the things they announced at F8 two days ago is only going to increase their competitiveness in the space. Facebook's CPC and CPM metrics have been steadily rising which shows how much more valuable their ad inventory is to advertisers. The success of Facebook comes at the expense of Google, and is a direct assault on their margins.

These are all things that are much easier to do than to build a Google competitor, but more importantly allows Apple to focus on their core competency, which is building great products.

And in case you haven't heard, Notability is free in the AppStore right now!

mac,HELP! I need some networking solutions!,"Hello all!

I'm kind of stupid when it comes to networking and such. I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I'm a graphic designer and am constantly losing track of my thousands of files spread between two computers and an (unrelated) server. Hopefully someone here can point me in the right direction, or better yet, give me a step-by-step Idiot's Guide.

**General Objective**  
I want to hook up an external, powered hard drive to my Airport Extreme, and be able to easily access it from anywhere.

**Hardware**  

* MacBook Pro  
* Custom built desktop  
* Airport Extreme  
* 1 TB powered external hard drive (looking for good recommendations on one, too)

**Super Picky Details**  
Basically, I'm always on the go with my laptop and away from home, but my desktop is great for heavy lifting AE or Premiere renderings. I would like to be able to access the hard drive from anywhere, with a fair ease-of-use. Best case scenario, I would like to somehow mount the drive in my Finder and under My Computer if at all possible. Just a simple drag and drop system with no ftp clients would be amazing.
  
I've searched everywhere, and either I'm not looking in the right places, I'm a moron, it's not possible, or there aren't very many clear/concise guides on the matter.
  
Any help you guys can give would be awesome! I secretly suspect other people out there have the same problem as me, so hopefully this can provide some closure for others as well.
  
Also, if there's any other photographers or digital artists out there, I would love to hear about your storage solutions!  

**TL;DR:** I just want a simple, easy to use/access, and secure space that I can place my important files that isn't in the cloud.

apple,The girl who has my iPhone...,"Hey guys,

So I was out last night at a very busy spot downtown. Around 6 pm I go out for a smoke, but the bouncer won't let me back in due to overcrowding. No big deal, I wanted to leave soon anyway. 

As I go through my bag for my iphone to call my friends inside I notice it's missing. I once again go back to the bouncer to explain my situation, but he's being a dick about it, and not letting me.

Once home I locate the phone (still at the bar), put it in lost mode, play a sound. Nothing. Then the battery died. FYI I managed to get in touch with my friends, but they had long gone home by that point too.

This morning a girl calls me very early from my phone to the number I specified in the lost mode settings. She says she 'found' my phone, and wants to set up a meet to return it. I ask her where she works and that we should meet nearby. I tell her I'll quickly check my schedule and call her right back.

Not 20 minutes later I try calling my phone back, no answer. 6 hours later, still no answer. I'm worried she might have changed her mind. It's still locating the phone (hasn't moved from some apartments across town in that time), now on very low battery again, but I'm not sure what to do. 

I can't just go to this area and knock on doors as there are at least 30 apartments within the shown radius. 

I sent countless sound alerts and tried calling.

Should I give her more time? Call AT&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;T? Try calling the police? 

Sorry for the rambling, it's been a short night, and I'm very frustrated about the whole situation. Ask if you have any questions as I'm sure I left out a lot of detail. Any input is appreciated.

Thanks!

Edit: thanks for all your responses guys, very very appreciated. I never anticipated it to get this much traction! Phone is almost dead, and still no response. Think I might be shit out of luck...

FINAL EDIT: thanks for all the attention this post received! (And sorry for the delay) After no sign from the girl, and the phone once again dying that night, I thought all was lost. The next morning I suddenly get an email that from find my iphone that it was located, and I immediately call it. A guy with a somewhat foreign accent answers and explains that the phone was left at his house by the girl who spent the night there with him. Needless to say, I found the whole situation a bit dodgy at this point, especially as the guy tried to avoid being held to a specific drop off point or time. He finally gave me his number and told me to call him later in the day when he was more certain of his schedule. A few hours pass, and I call... No answer! At this point I think, well, it's happened again, he gave me a fake number. I try continuously, for hours on end. He FINALLY picks up, and I manage to get him to agree to a drop off point (hotel downtown) in the afternoon, but again there was something very unsure and hesitant in his voice. 

I notify the hotel where a friend works that this guy would be coming by and leaving my phone, and tells me he'll call once it's been turned in. The deadline passes, nothing, no call, and no answer on the guys phone. Another 2 hours pass before I finally get a call from my buddy, saying it's been dropped off. Never expected this outcome, but relieved nevertheless!

mac,2010 MBP Battery Life Issues,"Hey all,

I'm trying to help a new friend who's had a problem with her Macbook Pro since she bought it. She told me that it never fully charges to 100%, and the longest it has lasted is one to 1 1/2 hours with nothing external (iPod, iPhone, iPad etc.) attached to it or the drive playing a cd or movie.

She also purchased an apple care plan at least six or seven times through the course of the three years complaining about the battery issue without ever getting a straight response. She was  told that they couldn't figure out what the issue was, and the last time she went in to the Apple store under Apple Care she was told that's probably the way her laptop was, and she was advised to use the cloud and not to hook up any devices to her laptop anymore.

Because we are now in 2014, I'm wondering if there's any recourse for her. I was considering just having her buy a new battery to see if that's an issue, and I'd change it out for her. 

I appreciate any input you redditors can provide. Thanks, and have a great week!",4.0,7,2014-05-05,AAPL,0.021133622154593468,0.8891991376876831,0.08966724574565887

apple,What's a non-essential feature you wish the iPhone had?,"Apple are usually the kings of not adding features 'for the sake of it' (ala Samsung's obsession with cramming eye tracking, split screen and a myriad of other features the end user never touches).

Having said this- what's a non-essential feature you'd love? I was discussing this with my brother (S4) and my dad (N4), and I was saying I wish the iPhone was waterproof. Seeing SONY's newest offerings can be both slick and watertight, I really hope Apple are working on this.

iphone,How to get back old photos from an old sync,"During Decenmber of 2013 my iPhone 5 started to act really weird. The battery would say it was at 5% so I would plug it in and then it would instantly jump to 45%, unplug it and it would shut off. It would also randomly shut off. I made a genius bar appointment and they said that the battery was maxed out and I need a new one. I said as long as I don't loose any of my mails and pictures on my phone, I'm ok with that. They said to sync it one last time and when you get a new phone it will be just like your old. When they replaced the battery, the phone worked great, I stood up to walk out and it just shut off. They took it in back and said that something else failed and I need a new phone. After a bunch of back and forth they replaced the phone less the cost of a new battery which I agreed to. The new phone started up fine and everything was great until 4-5 days later I noticed that my phone had still not added all of my photos back. I can't remember for sure, but I think it was just sitting there at like 300 of 5000 photos.

ipad,Need a *good* video player that will work with DLNA.,"**Ok. This has been going on for a few days and quite a few monies. I guess, I buy shit so whoever goes in my tracks doesn't have to**

I've seen a few posts from half a year ago, but a lot of them promote AVPlayerHD or warn about certain players not working with sound.

Currently my setup is XBMC on the main box and an iPad mini R for remote viewing. Most video is in MKV or MP4, nothing fancy.

What I want to do is: 
* Browse the video share and watch videos from it.
* Download files from it to the device.
* Preferably keep some sort of progress on what I have watched already.
* Be able to control the player itself comfortably

**NPlayer** is the current winner. It does DLNA, it does Styled Subs properly, it has a great all-around interface. More testing needed but looks like **the** player.

**AVPlayerHD** has a great sleek interface, is able to browse the shares, has all the great functions. It just won't play 80% of my videos. Whenever I click one, it switches to the playback interface for a fraction of a second and then pops back to the file list. [Relevant](http://xkcd.com/937/)

**GoodPlayer**... Well, it plays videos and doesn't choke on styled subtitles, that's about it. But the interface is atrocious, it looks like it's full of bugs (half of the submenus are empty although they should, probably, contain a list of subtitles or whatever else is relevant). Whenever I leave my home Wi-Fi it loses the DLNA connection until restarted. And the controls for the playback are bad, to say the least. But then again, it's the ~~only~~ other one of them that handles styled subtitles well.

**Infuse** is quite cute. Plays videos. Streams from network. Has the friendliest remote media source selection options. That's a $7 in-app purchase, though. Really great that it keeps tabs on viewing progress. But it fails the styled subtitle test =( HORRIBLY SO. Which may or may not be a deal breaker here. But overall this one seems the best (aside from the subtitles, yes?).

**Plex Media Server** has a web-based interface (that's a big ~~go fu~~ no-no). It throws **ALL** my videos together ignoring folder structure. It assigns **ABSOLUTELY RANDOM** titles and pictures to them based on some obscure guesswork from filenames (Ok, maybe not absolutely random. As far as I can see, any file with a name starting with ""101"" will be recognized as ""101 Dalmatians"" just because*). ~~And it doesn't even acknowledge there are subtitles.~~ Changing subtitles and audio tracks while playing is impossible, can only be done from media library screen before playing. The styled subtitle test fails somewhat. It also reencodes streamed videos into shitty quality for ~~reasons unknown~~great justice. Disabling this forced favor is a matter of finding and eliminating at least four settings and checkboxes on both the client and the server.

*e.g.: Guess what all [these](http://imgur.com/JzM6elb) titles have in common except that I have none of the actual movies in my library.

**OPlayer**
~~Well, this doesn't seem to come with a visible DLNA option. It might be in there, but I'm not an archaelogist, so I didn't dig in with a trusty shovel.~~ Nope, no DLNA/UPnP here. That functionality is reserved for AirPlayer  from the same developer, naturally. Somewhat more function rich than AirPlayer. Same subtitle handling - discards styles, but works with Unicode. Audio/subs are distinguished by number, not by description.

**AirPlayer**
Simple, clean, video works, but subtitle and audio tracks are enumerated by order, not by any characteristic. Processes subtitles half-heartedly. Handles Unicode well but discards color, font, position and any subtitles beyond the first set. No real reason to use this one over Infuse or GoodPlayer except asceticism, I guess.

mac,Brand New Mac Mini &amp; Thunderbolt Display Having Problems.,"I just Bought a brand new Mac Mini and a Thunderbolt Display off of eBay. According to the seller the screen worked fine, showed pictures of it working and all that. I get everything hooked up, connect my thunderbolt cable from the Mac and power it up. I get the boot sound from the monitor but no video. I plug in an HDMI to my old screen and see the video instantly. After the setup I check the system report and it shows the TB is connected so I test photo booth and the camera works, it shows up on the HDMI screen. The sound plays thru the TB. No video at all on the TB. I contact Apple support to see if I'm doing it wrong, they tell me no. I give them the model numbers and they said there is no compatibility issues.  Is the TBD broken?  I contacted the seller and he insists it worked fine while connected to a MBP using the built in cables. I don't own a MBP so I can't test that. 

TL:DR brand new Mac mini gets all function except video from TBD.  Is the TBD defective?",4.0,8,2014-05-09,AAPL,0.04406531900167465,0.9293398261070251,0.026594804599881172

mac,Best way to sell a MacBook for parts?,"Hi guys. After a long, slow death involving lots of screen wiggling, my early 2009 MacBook's backlight finally failed. I took it in to Apple who said it would either be the inverter board or cable (cheap fix), or a total LCD replacement (£300). It turned out to be the LCD that had failed, and given that I'd recently got an Air to replace it, I wasn't interested in paying that much to fix a five year old laptop. I'd put an SSD and 4GB of RAM in there a while back; they've gone on eBay because they're not much use to me anymore, so now I'm left with a MacBook with an old battery (~55% health), a busted LCD panel, and possibly no inverter board or cable as I'd don't know if they put the old ones back in when they tried a replacement.  
  
Is the logic board or the case worth anything on eBay? I can't imagine anyone would want the battery in the state it's in, but there's nothing wrong with the board or top case (though the outer shell has seen better days). If they are worth anything, is it best to split everything down and sell parts individually or just list the whole thing as 'for spares or not working'?

apple,Common Access Woes...(mini rant),"I love my macs.. really I do.  But seriously, WTF Apple?!  Each new OS update has a different take on this issue. 

For those of you who don't know, Common Access Cards (CACs) are military or government IDs that we use for everything.  Our jobs cannot be done without using them.  

Macs can read them but the hoops you have to jump through are seriously a pain in the ass, add to that the constant changes.  Some OS versions worked beautifully, Snow Leopard for instance.

iphone,Discussion: Do you think the 5S will fare well through 2016?,"I broke my sluggish iPhone 4 last month and have been waiting on my contract upgrade in a couple weeks.  My first world conundrum is this: I'm currently using a brick phone I can hardly even text with, so I would like to upgrade to a new phone as soon as possible.  I also have to be well connected for a job I'm starting soon. 

However, the iPhone 6 will be here in a few months and of course the tech world moves very fast with Apple.  I'm not interested in having a bigger phone or having the latest just for the sake of being at the front.  But due to the significant change we expect with the 6 (mainly screen size(s) and resolution), do you think the current-gen models will more quickly become obsolete than previous gens?  The 5S is blazing powerful now, but will it be so two years from now?

I'm quite set on going ahead with the 5S, but I'm still wondering what you all think looking into the future.  I just want speed and full app support 2-3 years from now, not like the iPhone 4 which has been horribly sluggish since the iOS 6 days.

apple,Wait for broadwell MacBook Pro retina?,"Hey guys,

I'm sure this has been asked a few times on r/apple, so I'm sorry if this is repetitive!

I want to upgrade from my late 2009 iMac to a new Retina MacBook Pro, which I would plug into a monitor at home. It's been a while, and I know both processing power and quality has improved incredibly over the last few years, and I want a MBPr as sort of a mobile powerhouse. I want to get it for the summer because I've got some media jobs coming up.

I'd be using a ton of processing power with Photoshop and I'd be editing and handling high res video with Final Cut Pro and after effects... Power is really everything with this computer and I'm going all out with memory, storage, and processing power.

My question is: when do you guys think the broadwell MacBooks will come out? I've heard haswell, although very efficient and powerful, gets pretty hot, which isn't optimal for the kind of stuff I wanna do. Also, I've heard broadwell will be much better and heat up less, and I've heard some other updates coming up (the rumored buttonless trackpad)


Long story short: should I wait for the new gen MacBook Pro? Do you think it will come out at WWDC?

ipad,How to tell which iPad mini Smart Case I just bought.,"There are basically 2 versions of the iPad mini Smart Case out there. 

One was made for the original iPad mini. The other one for the iPad mini which is 1mm deeper and has cut out for the second microphone on the back.

Reports whether or not the iPad mini with retina fits the old Smart Case varies. Some say it fits. Some say it doesn't fit anywhere near as good which is a shame for such an expensive case. In any case, the old case lacks the cut out for the other microphone. 

Apparently the packaging is almost identical to one another too. Including the line ""Compatible with iPad mini"". Apple Stores should know what product they are selling but sometimes other stores don't and will just tell you ""yeah... sure... it's for the retina"" to sell you the product. Which I think just happened to me.

So my question is this. How can I tell which Smart Case I just bought? There is nog picture of the backside of the case on the packaging so I can't tell if there is a cut out for the retina-specific microphone. Product ID is ME710ZM/A. Does this product ID differ from the old case? And is this ID for the newer iPad mini case that works with retina? 

This is an expensive case and I want to make sure it's the right one before I open it up...

mac,Bizarre problem with my MacBook Pro! Images on websites show up pixelated (with artifacts). Trouble connecting to wifi. Two problems definitely seem connected.,"1) I started noticing wifi problems with my MacBook last week while traveling. I wasn't able to connect to the internet at the Airport and then when I got home I couldn't connect either. But the weird thing was that I would see all the wifi bars meaning I was connected; I just couldn't get on the internet. I started playing around with network settings (just randomly doing anything like deleting airport and adding it back in, clicking on DNS settings), and it started working. But now each time I go to a new place (cafe, library, back home), I have to do the same random stuff for about 10 minutes before it connects to wifi. I don't know if I'm actually doing anything or if it is just the time elapsed that allows me to connect.

2) Second thing is that images in all my browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome) show up slightly pixelated now. I was thinking it meant that images are not being completely downloaded? I've tried viewing webpages on other wifi connections, and it is the same situation.

Other details on point 2:

* If I drag an image from my browser to my desktop and open it in Photoshop or Preview, it appears pixelated.

* If I drag a clear image from my desktop into a browser, it appears fine. So it is only the images that are being transmitted over the internet that are showing up bad.

* If I use regular screen grab tools on my browser, it shows up just as I see it (pixelated), but if I use something like Paparazzi (that uses its own browser?) the screen captures turn out fine. 

Would really appreciate any advice about this. Thank you in advance!!!

mac,2009 MPB starting to have problems with wifi. Disconnects every 10-20 minutes.,"For the last couple of weeks, I've been having problems with my wifi. I thought it was a router issue but have since taken my mac to another location and I experience the same issues of disconnects every 10-20 minutes. The signal strength is always at full but still drops for no reason. After reading up on-line, it appears to be a problem with the Airport wifi card in the mac and is a known issue.

I have two questions for people here:

1. Is there anything I can do to fix this issue without taking it in for repair? (I bought this in 2009, am now living in a different country and can't even begin to think about the amount of hassle involved).

2. Are there any wifi dongles or adaptors sold in Canada that effectively act as the Airport card available? I've found the [BearExtender 1200](http://store.bearextender.com/products/bearextender-1200-for-mac) but it is only available from their own site with a long old shipping time of 2-4 weeks. At $50 it's not cheap (before tax and shipping). Are there any decent alternatives?

iphone,AT&amp;T scamming iPhone customers out of grandfathered unlimited data.,"So a few days ago I got this message from AT&amp;amp;T: http://i.imgur.com/sC6z01g.jpg

I'm on a family plan with my parents. And they sent them a letter that looked like a marketing letter that mentions they will automatically 'upgrade' our service to a tethering plan, which requires we downgrade our grandfathered unlimited data plan to their current paid limited data plan if WE don't contact them.

Here's the letter: http://i.imgur.com/xPCYjnZ.jpg

I just so happened to be visiting them this weekend, and they asked me if I had any idea what it was about. They just assumed they had to buy a new plan.

Now.. I know that there are jailbreak apps for the iPhone that allow tethering, but because I know I haven't used one, I decided I'd see what they were talking about. So I called them and that's when things got interesting.

The AT&amp;amp;T rep informed me I was using my phone for unapproved data tethering, I told her that was impossible, as I have not jailbroken this iPhone. She asked me if I use music apps to play music on my car stereo, which I do daily, via Bluetooth or aux cable. She proceeded to attempt to tell me that this was considered tethering the iPhone to the stereo, and any time data is sent from the phone to another device, that is considered tethering.

Jaw.dropped. I believe the word I used was horseshit. 

Apparently AT&amp;amp;T owns all Bluetooth communications now? Am I going to have to start paying them for the headphones I buy because it's sending data to another device? What about the hands free headset they want me to buy in the store? That requires a tethering plan as well?

After I informed her how absurd that was, she quickly backed down and said that she would put a note in my file that it wasn't being used for tethering, and to have a good day.

I wonder how many ignorant customers they have scammed out of their grandfathered unlimited data plans into limited monthly data plans like this... What a terrible company.

Basically since there's no official Apple store in my country I'm forced to go to my carrier for any enquiries/requests for replacement of phone etc. When I went in hopes of a replacement phone, the guy checked my diagnostics and usage data and said that the drain was caused by 'apps crashing in the background' even though nothing is open, stuff having to do with the iOS and not any user installed applications such as 'assistivetouchd' and whatnot. He recommended a fresh restore and using the phone as new (no restoring from backup). Should I follow this guy's advice and do so?

I back out and open it again over and over and nothing happens until eventually it will open to a show. This process continues until I FINALLY make it to an episode and when I play it, it just buffers or will drop quality occasionally (which isn't that big of a deal for me) or it will do it's favorite trick of freezing on one scene and let the audio continue playing. I back out and then the process repeats until I give up and go read before bed.

Hulu Plus: Not really as buggy, but it has it's issues. On commercials, it will just black the screen and play audio and I have to back out, go back to the episode, watch the commercials again, and then be able to watch whatever I miss. That's really my biggest issue. Sometimes the quality drops but nothing as bad as Netflix.

I'm going to see if it's my router's signal being interfered with first, but I don't think it's that. I live in a small one bedroom apartment. If anyone else has any ideas, please feel free to share.",7.0,9,2014-05-28,AAPL,0.047430768609046936,0.9223695397377014,0.030199723318219185

iphone,iPhone Photography Thread,"What photography apps do you all use? I'll start:

- [VSCO Cam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?mt=8) - Hands down the best photography app I've ever used. It has awesome filters that don't suck like Instagram's and you can fine-tune any little adjustment you need.

- [Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8) - for posting pics for your followers. I don't have a whole lot, but I like posting pics that aren't selfies or screenshots or other crappy posts.

- [Anticrop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anticrop/id492663935?mt=8) - Great app if you take a pic and want to, well, reverse crop it. It doesn't always turn out well, but if it's a solid color it works great.

- [SKRWT](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skrwt/id834248867?mt=8) - This one came out a few days ago, and even though I haven't used it a whole lot, it's awesome. It lets you change the perspective/angle of a shot and also has other little adjustment thingies.

apple,Could Apple attempt to break into the console gaming industry? [Serious],"With WWDC coming up, I've been thinking about ways that Apple could go about surprising it's developers and redefining an industry in the same way that iTunes, iPods, iPhones and the App Store have done in the past.

One of the biggest things that stood out to me is that Apple may have a chance to do something very impressive in the console gaming market. 

They have a massive distribution network of developers and IP via the Mac App Store and the iOS App Store, they have some incredibly profitable games on each, and with the Apple TV they already have some of the basic pieces in place needed to deliver something along these lines.

Perhaps this is just wishful thinking on my part, being a long time iOS and OSX Developer but what do you think?
