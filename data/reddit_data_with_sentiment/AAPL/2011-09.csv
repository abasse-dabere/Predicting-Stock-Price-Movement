apple,"So, where's that September Apple event?","I'm sure I'm not alone here when I wonder why there has been no details about the September iPhone event as of late. Last I heard it was going to be September 7th, but since normally they give out invites ~10 days before an event, that date seems to be quite unlikely. Sprint has an event October 7th planned, but I figure that Apple would announce the device before that date.

apple,Gizmodo tells bullshit stories to buy stolen Apple property...,"So today I find this article on Gizmodo: 

http://gizmodo.com/5836908/man-gets-hard-drive-full-of-secret-apple-documents

It's about a customer who apparently received a hard drive with time machine backups of Apple's store servers on them. He apparently received this drive in error after picking up his Time Capsule from the Genius Bar.

The problem is, Apple does not fix or even disassemble Time Capsule units in store. They are sent out for those repairs (had mine fixed before). On top of that, when I submitted a comment to them calling them out on it, they flagged it as spam to keep it off their comments.

&lt;a href=""http://imgur.com/dTIrA"" title=""Hosted by imgur.com""&gt;http://imgur.com/dTIrA&lt;/a&gt;

My comment was a few sentences and had no links.

This smells like hushing the truth so Gizmodo can use their BS cover story to willingly offer money for stolen Apple property.

They even go so far as to make fun of other websites for not offering money to the guy trying to sell it! Another shameful day in internet journalism.

iphone,"How to start torrents from your iPhone, no jailbreak needed.","Have you also noticed that whenever you think of a great movie, album or game to download, you are somewhere far from your computer and have to write it down or try to remember it so you can download it later? (Of cooooourse I'm only speaking about downloading legal things here, I'm not a criminal)

For this to work, you need three things:

* [A dropbox account](http://db.tt/F94bhRe)
* A torrent client that can start torrents automatically from a folder (I use transmission, works great)
* [Atomic Web Browser](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/atomic-web-browser-browse/id347929410?mt=8) (99c in the app store)

Start your browser, and under settings, link it to your dropbox account, download a torrent file by pressing the link, hold a few seconds and choose download file.

Now press the downloads button in the bottom bar, and press the little blue arrow on the file you wish to transfer then ""Sent to Dropbox"".

This will create a folder in you dropbox location called ""AtomicWebBrowser"" and that's the folder you want to use for automatically starting torrents. There will be a setting for that in your client, in Transmission it's at the bottom of the Transfer settings.

As soon as you set the folder it should find the file you used to create the ""AtomicWebBrowser"" folder.

We went to a restaurant and I brought along my iPad. We took a table for 2, and I set the iPad with Skype on the edge. Then I called my dad and we had my birthday lunch together over 3G. The reception was awesome, and the sound was strong enough that it was like he was there.

Yeah, and the video worked too! We got a few awkward stares from the waiters but since the restaurant was empty it was awesome.

iphone,"GraviGolf is the first ever ""Pay-what-you-want"" game for the iPhone.","Hey All,

My latest game, GraviGolf, has just been approved and launched by Apple.

GraviGolf is a simple game (think Angry Birds meets MiniGolf) that has a heavy focus on gameplay and level design.

Until now, Apple has had a restriction against applications that incorporate donation functions using the in app purchase framework.  GraviGolf got around this by implementing a ""Karma Points"" system, which allows players to purchase points support further development of the game and to rise on the ""Biggest Fans"" leaderboard.

I'm really excited to get this game in the hands of the gamers and would love to know what you all think of it.  I've added some really cool contact features in the game that allows players to call my voicemail directly from inside the game!

apple,"So, Apple went completely and utterly beyond the call of duty for me today...","Long story short, I bought the base model 2011 iMac (base 21.5"" model) in May. Unfortunately, PC mentality was still well and truly in my head, and attempting to follow the iFixit documentation to try and install an SSD ended up in me left with a computer that merely made a funny smell when it was switched back on. Completely destroyed it. Was kinda pissed! Especially considering it was a month old...

So, after a couple futile attempts to put it back together again (in case it was a wrong wire or something), I just gave up, and the majority of the components now resided within the box. A mate egged me on, three months later, to take it to apple to see if they could do anything.

Thus, the walk of shame into Apple with most of an iMac in a box began.

Wasn't exactly holding out for much. Took it to them and didn't B.S. them - told them exactly what I did, and that I couldn't even find some of the components any more. I told them that I'd just buy the other components and pay for the damages, but they couldn't even do that, as I'd completely buggered up the machine, it wasn't even complete and they didn't keep the components in the shop to fix it with. Basically, I was completely out of luck.

The guy just couldn't believe that I had the thing a month. Trying his hardest to help, he suggested that I take it to an authorised Apple reseller, who would be able to help me out. 

I just basically gave up. Apathy was the adopted policy, especially considering the fact that I was a student and had spent a ridiculously large sum buying the thing already - just decided to cut my losses and asked the guy just to take what was left of it in for recycling. This shocked the guy a bit, I think he could really tell that I was pretty much done with, well Apple in general. He told me that he'd have to get the documentation to declare that I had given them the iMac.

I've tried dozens of other video remuxing solutions for mac. This is by far the quickest, simplest and most reliable..and free! Perfect for playing MKVs on a PS3 or 360 and more.

**It's just so awesome I just had to tell everybody. Doing this crap on mac kinda sucked before I found it.**

In case you don't know, MKV is a container file. It contains seperate video and audio files that are usually compatible with most video players. But the players simply can't read the MKV container.

So 'remuxing' is simply the act of tossing that perfectly good video and audio into a compatible container, like MP4. It takes minutes and no loss of quality because there's no re-encoding, except perhaps the audio. Which you can choose to do in AAC 2ch, 6ch, or passthrough.

*ps. 360 only supports Stereo (2ch) AAC. PS3 can do the 6ch AAC.*

**UPDATE**: Obviously MKVs aren't a problem on a real computer. But out-of the-box, very few devices support MKV. That's where this is brilliant.",217,313,2011-09-22,AAPL,0.03554089367389679,0.9284361600875854,0.036022935062646866

I used to be a professional software developer, and a few years ago I took up iOS development. I know the SDK pretty well and have a couple of moderately sucessful apps in the store.

* Not interested in organizing photos by 'Events'
* Slows down substantially with a large collection of pictures
* ""Copy files to the iPhoto library"" preference creates a duplicate of your entire collection which you've neatly organized in folders and surrenders it to Apple's fucked up way of organizing files, which I understand makes it easier for iPhoto to manage but makes it a pain for me to quickly find a specific photo in Finder (I don't want to have to open iPhoto every time I need access to a particular file)
* If I leave the above option unchecked then two things become a pain a) importing photos from the iPhone b) editing photos in iPhoto

I joined /r/apple when I first joined Reddit because I'd recently bought new macbook. I was a fresh convert and it was nice to have somewhere to get program recommendations, tips for OSX and a good general advice. Then came the time when I got an iPhone 3g and yet again it was a cool place to talk about our favourite apps and good workarounds for any issues, etc.

Lately it's just been a ""Hurr hurr, look at [company x] who copied [feature y], why all the stealing &amp; copying"" or ""[company z] are suing apple for patent infringement?! No way, screw [company z] you can't patent a general concept like that the patent system sucks"".

It's become a hypocritical fanboy mess and it saddens me because I know that most of you from the good old days are still here and hate it as much as I do. Those of you who don't side with the ""I have a mac therefore I'm better/smarter/cooler than you"" crowd. Those of you who don't hate an operating system/platform/device because it was brought out by a particular company but simply use what you prefer to use because you can see it's individual merits and flaws and accept both.

I guess I just wanted to say that I miss the old days when we could just be happy with what we use, leave other people to what they want to use and just help each other enjoy what we have.

(and no, I'm not saying that /r/[another_company] are any better at the fanboy crap but if they all jumped off a bridge would you do the same too?)",103,120,2011-09-26,AAPL,0.03975524380803108,0.9152030944824219,0.045041609555482864

apple,​61k vs 2k users... that's why people want to post questions here,"Look, if you can't understand why someone wouldn't want help from 30x times the people, you're being purposely ignorant.

So many questions at /r/applehelp get ZERO comments. That's not fair, and that's not how reddit is supposed to work.

I was going to ask a question, but after being being advised by the stuff in this subreddit to post to /r/applehelp, I don't see the point.

I hope the mods allow this post to stand not as a rip on you all, but rather as a reminder that there are legitimate reasons why questions would (and in my opinion SHOULD) be posted here.

Having said that, I understand why you WOULDN'T want questions here... but I think that people helping people is more important than being inconvenienced by posts you can hide with the click of a button. And that's all it takes.

tldr; utility from support from 30x times the readers trumps the inconvenienced caused by hiding posts you don't want to see.

P.S. I posted to /r/mac and got the responses I needed, and nobody gave me shit about it.

**EDIT:** Why not create a tag that the css of the subreddit can filter? This is a really goddamn good idea from [lawe2](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/kwtrm/61k_vs_2k_users_thats_why_people_want_to_post/c2nw2rj). Imagine titles like this:

    [ask] What MBP is right for a Mac newb?

And people can choose to see or not see [ask] posts!

**EDIT 2**

Alright mods, the people have spoken. Look at the votes. Look at the comments. We're asking for questions to formally be a part of the subreddit once again. We trust that majority rules, as the foundation of liberal democracy (and of reddit), will be respected. Please, at least give us a response.
