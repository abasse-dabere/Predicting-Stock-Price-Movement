apple,"Proposal to merge /r/Apple, /r/AppleHelp, /r/AppleMeta.","One of the moderators started a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/xi7wn/please_note_the_sidebar_guidelines_do_not_post/) requesting people read the guidelines in the sidebar, and move some of the posts to /r/AppleHelp.

This is, quite frankly, silly.  /r/AppleMeta has 25 subscribers and 9 total posts.  Ever.  There is no point to having a separate subreddit for that purpose.  Things at /r/AppleHelp are a bit better, just over 5,000 subscribers and a total of 10,000 submissions over time, but the rate of submissions is still not very high.

The result is that we're wasting moderator time and community goodwill on subdividing the information while not making an appreciable difference in how many posts people see.  I've not understood the point since I found these subreddits and the recent thread admonishing folks for not being in the right one simply brought the issue to the front of my mind again.

What do the rest of you think?  Do you believe the division is working out well, or is a silly distraction?  Would you prefer separate groups, or one big happy ""Everything Apple"" subreddit?

**EDIT 2012-08-02:** Almost one full day of comments, and this thread has generated a lot of useful posts.  In my time on /r/Apple I've seen a few of the mod threads like the one that inspired my post, and have gotten the impression that the mods and /r/Apple subscribers weren't 100% in sync.  I posted this straw man proposal in attempt to spark a useful discussion and generate some non-flame feedback for the mods and the community and the response has be amazing.  Even if you don't have a strong opinion on the proposal at hand, it is useful to post here why **you** come to /r/Apple, or /r/AppleHelp so the mods know their audience.  I have some personal thoughts which I'll probably share tomorrow in a regular comment, I'd prefer to not use the bully pulpit of being the thread starter give my comments extra weight, I'm just another subscriber here.

**EDIT 2012-08-03:** I added my comment to the discussion.  Ultimately the path forward here is dependent on the moderators of not only this reddit, but the other Apple reddits.  I think the reddit Apple community has a chance to become much stronger, but it's going to take cooperation and a common vision.  That's difficult in any online community.

I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to give the moderators some constructive and useful feedback.",162,455,2012-08-01,AAPL,0.049131300300359726,0.9238068461418152,0.027061842381954193

mac,A whole bunch of useful features in OS X which many new to Mac users don't know about,"A user from /r/OSX was asking about keyboard shortcuts and how to assign them manually.  I got to thinking about how many people there are out there who, unlike me, haven't been using Apple's Mac Operating System of one flavour or another since the mid-1990's, and how useful it might be for them to learn some of the functions built into OS X which have been around for a long time, despite being somewhat hidden from view and only really known to us old dogs who started out with a Quadra.

So I wrote this list of keyboard shortcuts and system tweaking tips.  It's far from exhaustive, but most of them revolve around the sort of usability and functionality we Mac users are always going on about, which new users sometimes find hard to dig out for themselves.  The Mac is, after all, quite different to Windows.  

I also hope there's one or two tips in there which long time users might not already know about, but if you think you might have one which I've missed, maybe we could eventually compile some sort of go-to guide which we could link to whenever someone asks for help with something which has already been asked before.

I've pasted the entire article as a comment, due to Reddit's restrictions on how long text only posts can be.

apple,I'm about to swap to Mac OS. Any other converted people - What made you change?,"I'm getting into audio production and home studio work and I've reached the end of my 
teather with my homemade AMD PC. I haven't been able to get anything right it seems
I had an Intel i7 PC that was 2.5 years old when I got myself AVID Pro Tools 10 software.
I had all kinds of issues including crackling hiss and bursts of white noise. So 
I bought a new PC - this time a AMD 8 core (just because I wanted 8 cores) - not
a great reason really. So I had the same problem there and discovered there
must have been a bug with my Windows CD. After installing a new copy of Windows 
everything has worked with minor hiccups here and there. I just had another BSOD
today while trying to create a new session in Pro Tools and I think I can't take any more. 
The kinds of reasons for things not working are always total BS. And yes all this
is really AVID's (the company that dominates the audio production market) fault. They 
just don't make software properly for Windows. It's like we pay full price for 
some beta test. So I'm at the point where I'd sell my two windows PCs just to get
the cheapest Mac that would fulfill my needs (a macbook pro). Another factor is 
just how bad Windows 8 is looking... I mainly just wanted to know what kinds of 
reasons cause other Windows people to swap to Macintosh. 

TLDR: Audio production software is just too unstable on PC. I'm going to swap to Mac.
What reasons caused other converted people to swap?",337,100,2012-08-01,AAPL,0.06445875763893127,0.8974412679672241,0.0380999892950058

apple,"A proposal for /r/apple. Let's collaborate on an e-book for users new to the Mac, and give it away free on the Apple Book Store.","We have all the expertise and tools we need to collaborate on something which could really grow.  I'm looking for volunteers from the /r/Apple community to help me compile The /r/Apple practical guide to using OS X.

We will collate all the little tips, tricks and help articles which get posted to /r/Apple each week into a rich media presentation, using all of the preinstalled tools in the iLife and OS X Mountain Lion suite.  Screencasts using Quicktime, animation using Motion.  Audio using Garage Band for beginners and Logic Studio for pros.

Rather than being an exhaustive ""For Dummies"" style manual, we include real world examples of how OS X and OS X native applications can ease workflow and increase productivity.  

I need as many people who are definitely interested helping to leave feedback below, with their particular area of interest and skills.  If you're a Podcaster, and you use Garage Band to record your show, what is your set-up?  If you're an artist, what is it about OS X that you couldn't live without and how do you use it everyday, in a way which others could learn from?  Are you a teacher, who uses a Mac to present to a class?  How do you draw up a lesson plan using iWork?  How did you integrate your Mac Mini into your home theatre system?  What is the one third-party freeware app the graphic artists and professional photographers amongst us couldn't live without?  

In short, what could beginners who've never used a Mac before learn from you?  What should people who have owned a Mac for a while, but never had the time to sit down and really learn how to get the most from it, spend an hour each night learning how to do, and how can you help them learn it?

What area in particular would /r/Apple users who would be interested in reading such a book like those of us who will be working on the project to cover first?  Leave your suggestions and feedback below.

After we've decided on a topic for the first ebook, we'll set up a Google Docs account which contributors can share resources and documents.  

Is there a way we can use iCloud to share iBooks, TextEdit and Pages documents with one another?  Should we use DropBox?  What Mac friendly collaboration tools are out there, which would best suite our needs?

At the end of the project, we will publish to the Apple Book Store.  

=====

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback so far!  We need a to-do list.  What's the best place for everyone to see what needs doing, and what has already been done?  Sorry if I don't reply to everyone's comments.  All your help is greatly appreciated.  Please stay tuned to this thread for updates and keep your offers of help and suggestions coming.

ink_golem suggested we make the first book an introduction to the basics and I agree.  Here is a mock-up of the front cover artwork:

But there's a few problems: You don't trust online password generators or you don't want to pay for a password managing program. That is no longer a problem! **OS X has a BUILT IN completely random password generator!!** And here's how to access it: 

* 1) Go into finder and search ""Keychain Access""
* 2) Open the program, and if necessary click the lock in the upper left hand corner and enter your system password to access the application
* 3) Now that you can fully access the application, on the bottom of the window click on the little ""+"" symbol
* 4) Now in the window it created, next to the ""Password"" box, click on the image of the key 
* 5) And there you go! Your very own OS X built in password generator! You can choose from the drop-down menu different options of passwords.

EDIT: Verge reports: Apple: YouTube app will not be included in iOS 6, Google working on standalone version

http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/6/3223775/apple-youtube-ios6

Apple's entire statement is below.

&gt;Our license to include the YouTube app in iOS has ended, customers can use YouTube in the Safari browser and Google is working on a new YouTube app to be on the App Store.

More Update:

Engadget has also heard from Apple and learned that while iOS 6 devices will lose the stock YouTube app, iOS 5 devices will not. It seems that either Google's licensing agreement permits it to stay on the older OS, Apple didn't want to go to the trouble to push out a point update that takes away a feature, or some combination of both.

http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/06/youtube-app-removed-from-ios-6-ios-5-confirmation-official/

UPDATE 2: from Engadget

&gt;*A YouTube spokesperson has provided us with the following quote: ""We are working with Apple to ensure we have the best possible YouTube experience for iOS users."" Not much to go on, really, but reassuring that the company's actively forging ahead with a new effort. Something tells us it'll take every opportunity to trumpet the awesomeness of its standalone app after being quietly pushed / left out of the latest iOS 6 beta.*

apple,"Pants stolen with iPhone, wallet. Hilarity ensues.","So this happened yesterday...

I'm training for a triathlon so lately Ive been doing a lot of open water swimming.  This morning Team In Training was out swimming at the same time my group usually swims the wharf. There were about 100 people in the water with tons of gear on the beach. I don't usually leave my stuff on shore when swimming but since everyone was there and I wanted to practice my transition I made an exception. 


We had an excellent swim, the ocean was glassy and the seals were friendly. Coming back, about 1/5th of a mile to go I had a weird feeling that some of my gear might go missing. I told My partner and she quickly reminded me that I'm stupid and to keep swimming. Though sure enough when we got back to shore my pants were missing! My shoes (with keys inside) and towel were still present. This was slightly inconvenient since a wetsuit isn't very comfortable for driving/working. On top of that, my phone and wallet were in the pockets. This is when watching the Bourne series and 007 pays off. As I was walking to my office to call pd and make a report, I remembered my MiFi and laptop were in my car. 


Dripping wet and sandy I popped open the laptop and logged into iCloud. Thank God I installed a GPS in my pants because they decided to take off towards the west side. I took off towards west cliff and turned onto Delaware. Right as I made the turn I saw a ~5'10 West-side douche-looking guy walking down the road about a mile from the beach. His wardrobe included; a long sleeve button up, backwards hat, AND MY PANTS. I pulled up next to him and exploded. I asked in the most polite innocent way (/sarcasm) if he was carrying my phone and wallet which he quickly denied. Then I asked why it looked like he was wearing my pants and oh, are those my boxers in your hand? 


He was angrily denying everything so, since he was wearing my pants and I'm pretty sure I didn't leave my guns or knives in the pockets I got out of the car to get the attention of a group of bicycles coming our way. I asked one of them to call 911. He accepted but then quickly fell off his bike... so that plan failed. I'm not sure if it was the threat of calling PD or my anger but the crook said FINE and pulled my phone and wallet out of his (my) pants and threw them in the passenger side window of my car. When I asked him for my pants he refused and started to walk off. I wish I could say that I tackled the guy and forced him to walk away from the scene without pants, but the guy who fell off his bike was bleeding pretty bad so I pulled out the med kit to help him out. PD came to take a report and they searched for the guy for a while but I haven't heard back.


So as a reminder, if you have a smart phone PLEASE enable FindMyiPhone and if you feel like stealing someones pants at least go home before you put them on.

apple,"Have you noticed iTunes sometimes doesn't download album art, even with perfect tags? Or have you ever wanted a special edition album art, available nowhere else, that iTunes won't download? Here's how to hack it from the iTunes Preview site.","1. Since you can't search the iTunes Preview site, head over to Google. Searching there will search all regional stores. Your search should read: site:itunes.apple.com search terms here

2. For this example, we'll be using Ilse DeLange's best-of album 'Here I Am', for which a high quality album art image is not available anywhere else: http://itunes.apple.com/be/album/here-i-am/id39278491 (Notice in the link that it's previewing the Belgium store's listing. iTunes won't download artwork for albums that aren't in your regional store, so this trick is also handy for foreign music!)

3. Open the preview album art image in its own tab: http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/059/Music/y2004/m12/d15/h22/s06.cjowwapl.170x170-75.jpg

4. Notice the file name says 170x170-75. The first two numbers denote the resolution, and the last number denotes the .jpg quality constraint (note that editing the quality doesn't work for everything, and some files that say 75 will actually be unconstrained). The standard artwork resolution for the iTunes Store is 600x600, so edit the resolution part of the file name to read 600x600. Also, in this case, changing the quality to 100 will give a higher quality image. Our result: [http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/059/Music/y2004/m12/d15/h22/s06.cjowwapl.600x600-100.jpg](http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/059/Music/y2004/m12/d15/h22/s06.cjowwapl.600x600-100.jpg)

And that's it! I just worked this out last night and figured I would share it with you good people.

Also, the 600x600 link works for all art, not just art whose dimensions are exactly 600x600—that is, non-square images are linked in the same way.",23,104,2012-08-07,AAPL,0.03187994658946991,0.9320294260978699,0.036090586334466934
apple,"Just how good is Apple's Customer Service?  Well, let me tell you...","I debated about posting here but I feel it something people need to hear, especially those who are on the fence about buying an Apple product for the first time.  

When Apple announced the release of the new Retina MacBook Pro, I was first in line to put in my custom order.  In fact I had been talking to my local apple store about such a purchase since before Apple announce the laptop.  So I put my order in and then I waited…and waited, 4 weeks it took.  Finally the day had arrived and my package was ""out for delivery"" OMG!  So FedEX showed up and left the computer at my front door since I had a signed waver for the package and incidentally I was unable to get to the door when they showed up (restroom).  

I open my front door to see that wonderful slim rectangular box leaned up against my door, excitement builds as I reach down to pick it up and inspect this most handsome geometrical shape.  Thats when I noticed it, a fist sized hole punished into the side of my box which I could peak in and see the white Apple packaging inside.  Upon further teardown I find that whatever punctured the outer shipment box had gone so far to also put a sizable dent in the Apple packaging.  

Now if you have ever opened an Apple product, you would notice, they are not liberal on space.  So I whip out my phone and start documenting the damage.  I then unwrap the apple package and inspect the laptop itself and just as I suspected, there was a pinky sized dent in the aluminum case.  

Now let me back up here, I've owned both Macs and PC's my whole life as I do a lot of software development for both platforms.  I prefer the Apple hardware/software as I am inherently a designer and they appeal to me more, but a fan boy, eeeehhh I doubt I qualify.  I have seen some pretty crazy PC case damage that when I contacted the manufacturer they would make me jump leaps and bounds to get it fixed/replaced and for the most part they would leave me without a new computer for the weeks/months it would take for them to write a wrong.  

So here I was, brand new mac, excitement has been squashed as I am now looking for signs of abuse since this computer had an obvious rough trip from Shanghai to my front door.  I call Applecare and explain my problem and what I received.  I told the guy on the phone I had documented the damage via my phone and could send pics which he asked me to do and I did.  He gave me several options on how to deal with this but the option I chose (since the macbook did in fact work seemingly fine) was for Apple to send me a new macbook and when I received that one I could use the packaging to send back the damaged one, awesome!  

Well to make this story even sweeter, I received a call from the Apple store where I made my order and them asking how I was liking the new machine, I explained what happened and they said hold on…  when they came back on the line they told me they had the exact retina MacBook Pro sitting at their store and they would swap it out for mine right then and there also allowing me to do a recovery via thunderbolt!  Awesome.  I head in and do the swap.  All is well and I am enjoying my new retina MacBook Pro just fine….until a week later, when the video card goes apeshit crazy!

I call up Applecare and they take note and setup an appointment for me with the genius bar at my local Apple store.  I head into the Apple store and although my mac stopped showing the video issue, I had documented it via video off my phone and showed the genius that.  He heads to the back and comes out with a brand new retina MacBook Pro plops it down on the table, pulls out a thunderbolt cable, transfers my data (only took 10 minutes for 300 gigs btw, holly crap!) and hands me ANOTHER brand new machine!  

So in the end, I am sitting here writing this on my THIRD retina MacBook Pro that Apple has given me in the span of two weeks.  Apple never made me sign anything, fill out anything, jump through countless hoops, I just called them up and within minutes they had a new machine on it's way to my hands.  Phenomenal customer service and even though they didn't need to, they gained a customer for life, again.

This is something that has irritated me since my first iPhone, as it hits me almost every single day.  I usually remember that I want to listen to the Audible highlights from the New York Times just as I'm leaving my house.  While this is fully streamable from where I live over 3g, when I'm in my car, the wifi at my house is still in range at 1 bar, preventing anything from happening until I drive away / turn off wifi.

I encounter a similar problem when I leave work and attempt to use Siri to make a call.  I'm outside my work building, but still baaaaaaaarely connected to the work WiFi, which means Siri pinwheels for about 30 seconds.

apple,Apple's iOS VPN implementation is seriously flawed.  I hope they get around to fixing this.,"Apple's iOS VPN implementation is seriously flawed imho. 

(Please don't downvote this because you aren't interested.  Downvote it if I am wrong. VPNs are a necessary evil for some)

1.  No ability to **force** a VPN connection whenever not on a known (home) network

2.  The vpn is *disconnected!* the moment the iOS device sleeps but the wireless connection remains active exposing you to a connection you may not trust. 

These are serious failings.  It has to be possible to mandate VPN connections AND persist them thru screen lock (or mandatorily reconnect them upon unlock and prevent any connection access in the meantime)

I have to travel for work to places where I simply don't trust the default connection and the iOS VPN policy is simply driving me nuts.

ipad,Don't have an Airprint compatible printer? Install this service to enable printing from iOS on any existing inkjet or laser printer.,"Hey guys,
I saw someone ask about Airprint capable printers, and thought I'd share my solution.  By following the instructions [here](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1293865) I can now print to my non-Airprint Brother HL-5170 from my iPad and iPhone.

ipad,802.11n 5 GHz does not perform anywhere near 300 Mbps on the iPad. Here's why.,"I started this post to ask why, when I'm using FileZilla to transfer files to my iPad 2 over 802.11n 5 GHz, I am only getting a 5.9 MBps transfer rate. I wound up answering my own question, so I wanted to post this summary to hopefully save others the effort.

[Example hype](http://www.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/RTN56U/) by my ASUS router that makes me excited for super-fast transfer speeds:

&gt;Double your wireless performance and bandwidth with simultaneous 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands speed up to 300Mbps concurrently

Now, my router can *push* those speeds, but its up to the device to be able to also *pull* those speeds. For example:

&gt;With 802.11n, the iPad only uses a single spatial stream and are not able to do channel bonding, limiting their link rate to a maximum of 65Mbps

-[Xirrus Networks](http://www.xirrus.com/cdn/pdf/Xirrus_SolutionBrief_TabletSmartphone.aspx)

[Wikipedia table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#Protocols) for 802.11 speeds.

Now I'm starting to understand my speed troubles.

&gt;Broadcom, has announced the new BCM4329 combination chip featuring 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth, and FM technologies all on a single die ... Broadcom states that their implementation of 802.11n in the new chip will boast ""up to 50 Megabits per second (Mbps) of actual wireless throughput""

-[HotHardware](http://hothardware.com/News/Broadcoms-Chip-brings-80211n-to-Mobile-Devices/)

&gt;BCM4329 - This is the radio chip that is being used in the iPod touch 3G, iPad, iPhone 4, iPod touch 4G, Apple TV 2G, and iPad 2.

-[TheiPhoneWiki.com](http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=BCM4329)

Now I know *exactly* why I'm getting 5.9 MBps (47.2 Mbps).

For what it's worth,

&gt;The [iPhone] 4S uses BCM4330, Broadcom’s newest WLAN, Bluetooth, and FM combo chip

ipad,"Best Student Setup I've Found, So Far.","Just to share with you guys, this was the first semester that I decided to bring my iPad to class with me in order to get better organized, take notes, etc.  I bought a $50 iTunes Card and went to work going through Apps, trying them, etc.  Here's what I have found:

**Organization:** iStudiez is the only app I've found that does everything I need it to.  I've heard some people call it an app for power users, but I find how in-depth it is fantastic.  Seriously, go get this app.  I think it's on sale for 99 cents right now.

**Note Taking:** Notebooks for iPad, currently $8.99, is amazing.  It has all of the note taking features oddly missing from some of the other note taking apps (like formating styles, bullet points, numbered points, etc).  It also has a lot of neat features that all work together, so you aren't stuck using certain features only in certain parts of the app.  The best part of this app is that you can process your note files into anything you want: RTF, txt file, or even PDF.  Doesn't matter what type of note you started, you can convert it to a new format as a copy, and then send it over to Dropbox or Box.

**Storage:** I love Dropbox, but I use it too much for other things now.  I do a lot of video and audio editing, so my account is maxed at the current referral rate of 20 GB.  It's constantly at least half full, and I have all of my other projects there.  Right now Box is running a personal account special of 25 GB for free, plus free syncing to Desktop.  I saw the link on Lifehacker over the weekend for the 25 GB account; you have to use that link, you can't sing up normally or you'll only get 5 GB.  You can open all of your notes into the Box app on iPad and then save them right there.  Done!

**Accessories**: Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard and Case, Rocketfish Stylus.  I got both of these at Best Buy, $100 and $10 respectively.  They work perfect for taking notes, and I really *really* like the the Ultrathin Keyboard.  The Stylus isn't the best response wise, but for handwriting and sketching it works fine.  It's not the best if you want to do actual artwork and whatnot.",61,112,2012-08-20,AAPL,0.04362158477306366,0.9234142303466797,0.03296412527561188

I closed it out and left it for another few minutes doing nothing on my desk. Woke it up and checked the stats again, Usage 4h 25m, Standby 4h 25m. battery had dropped to 68%. Then I force quit all the apps and closed it out for another few minutes. When I woke it up the stats were, Usage 4h 25m, Standby 4h 28m and for the next 2 hours the battery percentage was stable at 68%.

apple,Apple vs. Samsung / Butthurt...? then read on.,"To all of you telling us that Apple is the new evil in town.

I bought one of the earlier Galaxy model, it was based off Android 1.5. The thing was not upgradeable to Android 1.6. It had to be severely hacked to work with 1.6.2, and 2.0 required far too much time to effectively be usable. All this happened over a 6 months time frame. This was the end of Samsung and Android for me.

Before Apple got into the phone business, we where sitting ducks with the Nokias 7650 (first phone with a built-in camera, but could only hold something like 20 pictures) or the Siemens SL45 which could act as an MP3 player (but required a special headphone plug, and a memory expansion + a very fiddly software), not to mention the Sony P900 phones which almost got it (except for the crappy screen resolution). None of the phone before the iPhone were actually made for users, they were only made for the marketing gurus: ""Let's add this one feature to edge out the competition by the smallest margin"". None of these phones had a sensible desktop companion software to avoid loosing all your contacts while migrating to a new phone. Nokia came along with a bloated software suite which would not work well with outlook (and required a PC...). And yes, iTune is not the best but it works.

The only exception was Blackberry, for business. They had it all figured it out IMHO but that's all gone now, and the Sony Clié line of PDAs (had Sony continued in that direction, and merged into a phone, I think we would have had a serious contended to the iPhone... The NZ90 was well ahead of its time had an incredible screen well ahead of its time... But it did weigh what seemed like a ton).

Nobody innovated, they just raked the profits. Apple did it for the user first, they designed a phone that works and that would work for more than 12 months (other phone just died from the cheap plastics). Sure, it was expensive, but I do not see it as being more expensive that the other 'original' phone introduced at the time.

On the plus side, seeing Samsung having their ass handed in court is a bit of a warm feeling for me. Having been involved in the medtech sector, I have seen on countless occasions patented products being 'improved' by Korean companies. The patents are filed by small startups after years and years of research but Korean companies have no problem copying (or improving as they call it). Nobody prosecutes it, because no one can afford it... So this largely goes unpunished.

So, there you have it: competition provided us with only incremental, marginally, specification-driven upgrades to say that such and such companies owned X% of the mobile phone market. This type of competition did not help us in getting better phone, because all the manufacturers, like the herds of sheeps that they are followed each other. 

Edit: As some rightfully pointed out I left the Treo and Windows Mobile SmartPhones which were available at the time the iPhone came out primarily because those platforms are (sadly) not really with us today. But these certainly added email capability to phone, but were missing a fully functional web browser, and were definitely not consumer grade devices....",713,199,2012-08-27,AAPL,0.03280697017908096,0.9209563136100769,0.04623670503497124

apple,A question about Steve Jobs at the 2001 Macworld Keynote,"(I apologize in advance if this has been answered in the biography, I haven't read it) 

This has been bugging me for a while. At the 2001 Keynote presentation, Steve was showing off new features of OS X 10.1, like the DVD Player, movable dock, and Finder burning. However, when he got to the part where he was going to demo how Image Capture pulled photos off a digital camera, he couldn't get the camera to turn on. Eventually he got frustrated and threw it to a member of the audience who also couldn't get it to work. Later in the show, Steve again tried to get the camera to turn on and almost lost it again, but this time it did eventually turn on. Now, I know that back then there were still presentation hiccups that we don't see much anymore with Apple, but I can't figure out what was wrong with the camera and why it doesn't appear to have been prepared properly before he got to it. Did the battery die that fast? Was the button broken? If anyone has more information about this, please post it here!",18,22,2012-08-27,AAPL,0.08459125459194183,0.8933682441711426,0.02204047329723835

Everyone's belongings had been gone through and thrown everywhere but the only thing missing is my macbook pro - a retina that I bought a week ago. My first mac. 

Now I have find my mac installed on the machine, but it's also password protected - now i know in order to get a GPS fix the computer needs to be connected to the internet, but with the user/computer password (and the guys who took it are no doubt junkies from a neighbouring suburb so I doubt they're going to have 'hacking' skills). Am I right in assuming that I'll probably never get a find my mac result?

Should I perform an icloud wipe or lock? Or would that alert the would be thief? Should I lay low for a while and keep checking back until it's sold on?

I'm really lost here and quite frankly the sting of losing a 3k investment is fucking killing me - I'm a young guy working part time and I've saved up all year for my first mac and this happened.

iphone,"Seriously considering going to an Iphone over the Droid, got some questions...","I was awed by the droid when it first came out. A touch screen phone you could customize and do whatever you wanted with. Loved my first droid, Moto Droid. When it came time to upgrade I got the Samsung Charge. Great screen, bigger phone, more fun, but the battery life was crap. Total crap. It also took forever to charge back up. A very terrible name. After 6 months I got the Droid Razr...better battery, better charge time, GPS was clockwork (crap on the charge), thinner, but the screen leaves fingerprints everywhere, the camera is just terrible, and overall I am just bored.

Last christmas I got my wife an Ipad 2 and we both fell in love with it. Ease of use, reliability, battery life, all of it was awesome. I've had ipods but never really gave the phone much thought. After a good 6 months I am seriously considering it and have done a lot of research but would like some first hand thoughts...

Battery life? I can get maybe 4 hours of heavy use/surfing/apps on my phone with brightness all the way down. 6 with moderate use, but usually have to charge once or twice a day, the phone gets hot quick. Even with ICS and all that android has done apps still drain the battery and nothing has imporved. I have read/heard it is different with the iphone, but how about heavy to moderate use?

GPS? I've heard nothing about it.

itunes or music - is it still as easy as click and drag from my pc onto itunes to get it on my phone? 

is there any way to link it to my pc, not just my itunes account?

what icloud services are offered/used by you guys?

screen/video? As in netflix, hbo go, whatever.

is jailbreaking still possible on the 4S? If this isn't allowed on this sub a simple yes/no will suffice, I don't need a tutorial.

I've always been impressed with the camera, Siri looks cool, but what seems like freedom has just become clutter for me - speaking of android. I like it with my tablet, considerably (Nexus 7 and EEE pad), but for phones it's gotten too much, too big, and not worth the cost every month and per phone when I can't use it for a full day (partially carrier issues, but that's another issue). I do love the maps SO much, and so many google applications, however any other 3rd party apps are available on IOS as well, and I can't weigh the good from the bad anymore without being stuck in the middlle.

EDIT: by linking to PC i mean on my old DROID and current one there are apps or software that allows me to stream movies/music/video from my pc to my phone from essentially anywhere. Not just having itunes but something separate altogether.",141,120,2012-08-30,AAPL,0.03600402921438217,0.9315299391746521,0.03246603533625603
