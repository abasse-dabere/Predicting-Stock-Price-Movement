apple,Comprehensive iTunes Match Review (Thinking of getting it? Here's how you'll use it),"With posts circulating about iTunes Match, I'd like to throw out a summary of information about actually using the service that you'll only find while hunting through countless blogs.

- It's $24.99 as billed to your account.
- It allows you to begin the matching process immediately. (Make a backup of your library first)
- It won't let you use the service if you have more than 25,000 songs in your library (apparently it won't even let you make a subset of songs to use, it simply won't work). I didn't experience this particular scenario, so I'm not sure if it's still the case today.

Once you tell it to begin matching, it goes through a 3 step process that takes a long time. The first two steps aren't as long as the third step and I'll explain:

- Step 1: Gathering information about your iTunes library

This process didn't take very long. It seems to collect the names of songs.

- Step 2: Matching your music with songs in the iTunes Store.

This step is fingerprinting your music and finding songs that match. It seems that some of this bleeds over into step 3 if it can't find a match right away with identical album/artist information.

- Step 3: Uploading artwork and remaining songs.

This step is what takes the longest. It will upload all the songs that can't be matched to the cloud for you. It took my DSL connection (slower upload than cable) just short of a day (18 hours) to upload the 1700 songs it couldn't match. (It successfully matched 2300).

Before you do anything, you should let it complete the process. You'll want to enable ""iCloud Download"" and ""iCloud Status"" columns in your library in addition ""Name, ""Artist"", ""Bit Rate"" etc.  Once that is finished, all of the ""waiting"" iCloud Status text in the playlist next to songs (if you choose to show it) will go away and you'll either have ""Matched,"" ""Uploaded,"" or ""Ineligible"" statuses next to each song.

- Delete Dialog 

At this point your service is ready to go. If you want to upgrade a song's quality then you could make a smart playlist with songs whose bit rate is less than 256 kbps and whose 'iCloud Status' is Matched. From there just delete a song (Option+Delete in OSX, Shift+delete in Windows  both delete the actual song from the hard drive while in a playlist). With iTunes match enabled, the delete dialog box has a checkbox asking if you also want to delete it from the cloud. You don't want to check that though, you simply want to get rid of your local copy. 

When you click delete then the song doesn't disappear from your playlist anymore; it is there with a small cloud icon next to it in the ""iCloud Download"" column. You simply click this icon and it will redowload the song to your library as a ""Matched AAC"" 256 kbps song. In my experience 99.9% of the songs are 256 kbps, but a few are a little lower. You have now upgraded the quality of your song.

Some songs have errors on Apple's side when trying to download (for me, 3 in 1000), but they may work again the next day. If you need the song again immediately then just re-import a copy form the backup you made.

- Downsides to Upgrading

It doesn't download new artwork or corrected metadata. It never actually deletes the metadata of the song you trashed even. When it grabs a new copy, it keeps your old metadata/lyrics etc. If a song is incorrectly named, it will remain so until you change it yourself.

The artwork that got uploaded when you first match is the artwork that sticks. If you change album artwork and do a ""Update iTunes Match"" from the Advanced menu, you'll get any artwork changes you made reverted to the first uploaded version. The metadata persists though. The workaround for this, as far as I can tell, is to Turn off iTunes Match from the advanced menu then make artwork changes. When you re-enable the service and add your computer again, it sends the new artwork to the cloud.

Another downside is if you have a mislabeled song, you won't be able to know which song it was matched against. If you are desperate for accuracy then you'll have to comb the database and find the correct song with a similar length. That wouldn't be so bad except you can be matched against the database of other countries. You'll have to search iTunes on the web too since only your country's store database is available in the iTunes app itself when you're logged in. I have found that DJ remixes and classical music are the worst songs to find if you don't have the correct metadata going in. In short, Compilation CDs of music from the 90's most likely won't be in the database as that album. If you want to modify the metadata to something in the library then it'll involve some work.

Some songs (especially rap/hip hop music) can be mismatched. Within the context of hip hop music, if there is a ""clean"" album then your uncensored tracks may be the clean edit when upgraded. This adds a lot of burden of finding out if it upgraded you to the wrong file if you have a large number of rap songs.

- iOS Service

Enabling match on your iOS device clears any songs you have residing there. It then (after a minute or so) gives you your entire library as a list with iCloud icons. Clicking the iCloud icon downloads just that song to your device. It also streams in the sense that it will begin downloading the next song in the list to have it ready when your current one finishes. If you have mobile bandwidth then you might like this service. If not then you'll probably only use it on the road for a specific song or two that you've been wanting to hear or show someone.

- Adding New Songs

Just got a new song? Add it to iTunes normally and you'll see a ""waiting"" ICloud Status. Just context click the song and choose ""Add to iCloud"" and it will search for that song's match then upload it if it couldn't. It's simple and a nice way to fix that one annoying track in some album that couldn't be matched if you have a slightly different copy somewhere.

- Closing Thoughts

It's a pretty cool service. The AAC files aren't DRM protected as I can open them in Audacity to edit them if I want to. The files do have your name and account email within them. Upgrading from 128 kbps to 256 increases the file size. I didn't realize the quality hit I was taking at 128kbps until I listened at 256kbps (instruments I had no idea were in songs suddenly appeared). It successfully matched songs as low as 96 kbps. Other songs I had that were too low were successfully matched if I just converted them to 128kbps, but I wouldn't rely on that trick. Those annoying clicks or errors in very old tracks from bad hard drives over the years will be gone. Having a cloud based backup of your library is pretty reassuring. It's a year worth of service with automatic renewal unless you disabled that in your account. It won't match every song so don't expect it to. I was happy to have more than 50%, but you won't know until the entire long matching/upgrade process is completely finished (it doesn't report accurately until it's all done so don't stress if it shows a low number at first). Hopefully this description of how it works helps you in understanding the details of the service. Just remember to back up (make a copy of) your library before you sign up.",85,247,2012-06-02,AAPL,0.048700956627726555,0.9207097887992859,0.030589274130761623

I am a Canadian lad.  Today happens to be a scorcher of a June day,  so, naturally, everyone wants a slurpee.  While I got my slurpee today I happened to leave my iPhone on the counter.  I didn't realize it until I got home either.  Ugh.  Anyways, I noticed as soon as I drove up my driveway, so I quickly went right back to 7-11.  I rushed because I knew it was packed and that there were lots of opportunities for people to steal it. Anyways, it wasn't there. It was gone.  :(

So I went home and got on my laptop, wanting to cancel it (after calling at 9 times to no avail).  I didn't know which Rogers line to call so i googled ""lost my Rogers mobile phone, who do I call"" and FindMyiPhone popped up first.  I forgot i downloaded that shiz.  I was instructed to go to www.icloud.com and sign in there. I did, and my phone was tracked to a specific address, not far from 7-11.  First I locked it.  I was hesitant to go to the house, because I know sometimes GPS can be off (for example my address on Google Maps is marked as my neighbours house).  I eventually went to the house that FindMyiPhone told me to go to, and it was there!!  I was thoroughly impressed!  Turns out it was taken by some kid. Not surprised.  I'd like to also mention the look of terror on the mom's face when she realized we found out where they lived, aha.

ipad,"I'm the luckiest man alive, or at least my iPad is...","I went into the city tonight for a small choir concert my wife was singing in.  When I do such things I usually like to go early to secure a good parking spot and seat, as well as some quiet time by myself.  I opted to take my iPad 2 with me to do some reading or web browsing depending on wi-fi availability.  On my way out I stopped to clean out my car in the garage, and then grabbed cash at a drive-up ATM and dinner at a fast food drive through about 5 miles from the house.

   I noticed that after I ate dinner in my car and then left the restaurant parking lot, that my iPad was not in the car!  I quickly thought back to when I used the bathroom at the house and left it on the sink, and then tried to remember if I brought it into the garage with me but couldn't remember!  I pulled into a turn lane to do a U-turn thinking I should go check.  I then opted not too, talking myself into the fact  that I either left it on top of the car(where I usually place things while in the garage) and it fell off and is gone by now, or it's on the bathroom sink at home.

   I drove a little further and then realized my brain would be wondering all night so I needed to turn around.  I whipped a quick U-turn the next chance I got, drove home and lightly looked out for it on the side of the road, just in case it did fall off of the car.  I really convinced myself at this point that I'd left it at home, as that was the last place I really remembered it but I needed to rest my firing brain cells.

   Not seeing it anywhere along the road I get home and pull into the driveway with a little urgency.  I hop out of the car and head in, but think I should take a quick glance and see if by some miracle my iPad would be on the car, and IT WAS ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR!  Sitting there in it's leather folio, also inside it's zagg leatherskin, magnetic smart cover, and zagg screen protector.  It held onto the roof of the car for a good 6-8 miles of me driving around not like a crazy person but not gently either.

   I never made it into the house, I grabbed it off the roof of the car, said my little ""holy crap what if I'd lost it"" speech to myself, and made it back to the concert with 5 minutes to spare before the beginning...

EDIT: I should add, that if I hadn't turned around, a 65MPH road was in my near future on the way to the concert.  If I'd gotten to that road, I think I would've lost it for sure!

TL;DR drove around town for 10 miles with my ipad sitting in it's case on top of my car",25,98,2012-06-06,AAPL,0.03787672892212868,0.9252539873123169,0.03686925023794174

I don't mind it being an App on the phone but I don't want it built into the iOS.

What are the chances that Apple will offer a 'killswitch' for a FB? Or are they giving users another reason to jailbreak their devices?

&gt;We also reported that Facebook will be used by Apple to alleviate some of the App Store application discoverability issues: **the popular Facebook “like” buttons will come to the iOS App Store** on iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches.

That narrows it down a whole lot. 

I look up all the names of the tenants in the building, and there's only one person registered with that first name.

iphone,Hidden Features of iOS 6 Beta,"**UPDATE**: Some images for fellow redditors! [Clicky!](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/uxb3r/ios_6_beta_1_iphoneipad_screenshots/)

I figured it would be nice to make a thread to share some hidden features or features that weren't really talked about iOS 6 Beta at WWDC. Some things I noticed:

* Downloading an app no longer pushes you back to the home screen.
* An app that has been updated will get a blue ribbon overlaid in the corner that says ""New"" (similar to a newsstand app).
* In the app store if an app is already installed the button will say ""Open"" instead of ""Installed"" and pressing it will open the app on your phone.
* In iMessage you will be able to link your email address to a phone number.
* Music app has been changed to look more like the iPad Music app.
* iTunes/App Store apps have been changed.
* The status bar now is a light semi transparent color and the color changes based off of whatever color the navigation bar color of the app you are using is.
* iPad gets a really nice default clock app.
* You can choose to show an iMessage alert from everyone or just numbers/emails you have in your Contacts.app
* Bluetooth on/off toggle now directly at the top of the Settings.app next to Wifi toggle

Edit:  

* Photos.app now uses a Photo Stream tab to access your photo stream instead of doing it as an album.
* Share buttons now use a grid like way to select where you want to share (iMessage, email, twitter, facebook, etc) instead of popping up as a list.
* In the iPad Clock app the temperature of a city shows up in the World Clocks view in addition to the time in that city.

Edit #2:  

* Phone.app keypad is now a light colored theme instead of dark.
* Camera.app now has a dark bottom bar, along with a black shutter button.

Edit #3:  

* When Do Not Disturb is active a moon icon will appear next to the clock. You can also set a time to turn on/off the DND feature automatically and can allow/block repeated calls within 3 minutes to go through.

Edit #4:

* A lot more emoji icons!
* iPad Settings.app has a thicker gray bar between the ""categories"" of the settings on the left scrolling table.

Edit #5:  

* Weather.app has a slightly different font (less bold) and the blue background kind of has a glow/gradient.

Edit #6:  

* With the new Maps.app zooming out all the way will show a 3D Earth instead of a 2D map. (only for Satellite/Hybrid view)

Edit #7:

* In Clock.app you can pick a song in your iPod.app to be used as an alarm.

Edit #8:  

* Don't recall if this was mentioned but in Settings.app you can set a different signature for each mail account now.

Edit #9:  

* Lost mode of Find my iPhone: When this is enabled the default wallpaper changes to a lock icon and a phone number can be input that will be displayed in addition to a message. A user can tap a button and if the device is an iPhone it will call the phone number you chose. In addition you will be able to see a location trail of the device if it changing location.
* Find my iPhone now shows the battery state of a device (how full the battery is and whether it is plugged in or not).

Edit #10:  

* You can now adjust the speed required to activate Double and Triple-click Home from Default, Slow, and Slowest settings.

Edit #11:  

* Reminders.app When selecting a location for location based reminders you are no longer limited to locations in your address book. You can type a location manually.
* FindMyFriends.app You can have the phone notify a contact through a push notification automatically when you arrive or leave at a certain location. You no longer have to set up a reminder and then manually message them. I believe the caveat is that the other user has to have FindMyFriends.app installed on their phone as it goes as a push notification through that app.

Edit #12:  

* When a device is locked a lock icon no longer shows up in the status bar.

Edit #13:  

* Searching for an app in spotlight now also shows you the folder it is in.
* Adding a new tab in Safari.app will create it to the right of your current tab instead of all the way to the right.
* Mail.app allows attaching of photos/videos from within the application.
* The shutdown spinner indicator has been updated to retina quality.

Edit #14:  

* If you started push by turn navigation and moved to a different app you will receive a local banner as a notification when its time to make a turn.

Edit #15:  

* Formatting (bold, italics, underline) is available for email signatures.

Edit #16: Credit to [Corrie9](http://www.reddit.com/user/Corrie9)
&gt; * While listening to podcasts or audiobooks, the skip buttons on the lockscreen and multitasking bar will change to rewind 15sec/skip 15sec.

http://i.imgur.com/3hh9F.jpg

&gt; * Double tap on an date in the calendar will take you to the day view of that date

&gt; * With auto-brightness enabled, the brightness slider now represents the current brightness, is live updating. The setting you manually choose is the lowest it will go.

&gt; * The European volume limit is currently disabled, can be turned on and off in the music settings (button not working).
Music through headphones is much louder on european devices now.

http://i.imgur.com/m10sw.png

Edit #16:

* For iTunes match users there is no longer a cloud button to download a song, instead tapping the song will start playing it and download it to your phone.

Edit #17:  

* Reminders.app now can use badges
* You can now rearrange mailboxes in Mail.app",221,252,2012-06-11,AAPL,0.12605340033769608,0.8460573256015778,0.027889231219887733

apple,Why are so many so actively against the Retina Macbook display?,"I've never seen so many negative, pessimistic comments about a technological advancement seemingly without purpose as I have here (and on r/technology) over the last few days.

Here's a snippet of quotes from a single thread:

&gt;WOW! NOW MY ICONS LOOKS SO GOOD! 10/10 would pay $2500 for this feature


&gt;Great-- the next time I press my retinas against the screen, I'll be wishing I had a retina display.


&gt;I would care if I had mega-powerful zoom lenses in my eyes, but I don't.


&gt;The cool aid has really been drunk by everyone in this subreddit.


&gt;I dont always look at my screen from a quarter inch away...


&gt;The beauty of retina display is that there's wasted pixels and it doesn't actually look any better when you view it from a distance like you normally would use a phone because your eyes can only detect so many pixels in such a small place.


&gt;Yeah that's what im saying. You can't see them anyways. my monitor and laptop have no retina display and are still crystal clear.


&gt;Ok, I'm not trolling here, this is a serious question. Are there actually people who care so much about this that they're going to go out and buy a whole new MBP? Seriously? I mean, the only people who ever see mine are the people who walk past me in the uni library and I doubt they care; but even if they did, they both look exactly the same. I honestly doubt there's anyone squinting at their current screen, wishing for a better resolution.

Obviously, there's kinks to be sorted out over time - apps will need to be updated, web workflows will have to be tweaked - but this comes down to software and graphics needing updating, not the hardware being a problem.

I'm one of the ones who's beyond excited about having the option for a Retina screen in a Macbook. I can see individual pixels on a 27"" iMac from most normal distances, and the jump from the 3GS to the 4/4s was an absolute joy - and I can't wait until it's the standard for screens across the spectrum. It's not that current screens aren't ""good enough"" - it's that current screens can be better yet.

If you're one of those against the Retina in the Macbook, could you explain why? ""I personally won't see the difference"" doesn't quite explain the number of going-out-of-the-way comments we've been seeing for the last few days.

**EDIT**: One more question, for those of you saying that it's unimportant or unnecessary because they were already 80-95% ""Retina:"" why do you feel it should stop there? Do you have a solid, not-just-my-preference response for why you'd *want* it to be less that 100% in the long term? This argument makes no sense to me.

*EDIT EDIT**: To expand upon my last edit, this is how it feels like the exchange is going:

&gt;Apple: ""Here, we've made the screen 100% Retina!""

&gt;Dissenters: ""Fuck off, we want pixelated 80% screens because they're already close to Retina!""",429,102,2012-06-15,AAPL,0.05600770190358162,0.9105446338653564,0.03344764932990074

apple,How to properly use Mac OS X,"I just took the plunge into blogging, and my first piece of writing turned into a (5000-word) rewrite of tricks / apps I've collected through the years on how to work more efficiently with OS X. Thought some people here  could make use of it. The site is brand-new, this is a self-post so no karma, and there is no advertising so hopefully it won't be seen as linkbait. Also my first stab at writing longer, so if you have any comments on writing style, I'd be more than happy to listen!

**Edit:** Instead of AppZapper, get AppCleaner; same thing for free. Thanks to everyone for notifying me on that.

**Edit2:** Turns out that one does not simply teach reddit new tricks. After reading the article, read below for contributed set of tricks I'm adding below.

Some of these will find its way into the article, but at that point it will no longer be on there so I'm posting a quick hashing of new knowledge I got from this thread.


**Totalfinder** - tabbed Finder.


**Unarchiver** - obvious for rar files, so used to it that I forgot to add it to the article.

**BetterTouchTool** - Saner touch controls for Lion (alternative: Jitouch, $7, better UI)

**MplayerX** - VLC alternative.

**Xslimmer** - Strips out unnecessary languages and binaries (powerpc binaries etc) from apps and OS. I would argue the need for this has receded, but nevertheless it's nice. Beware though, some apps don't take modification too kindly.

**Launchbar, Quicksilver** - Alfred alternatives. Alfred is simply my choice of the three, these are good.

**Moom, Cinch** - Alternatives to Divvy, somewhat less control, but everyone to their own.

**Trick:** If you want to have a modern filesystem without having to use NTFS trick, check out exFAT. ~~Available only on Lion+ though.~~ Also works on SL. Potential backwards compatibility issues with older OSes.

**Trick:** Dragging the small folder icon at the top of the Finder window while pressing Command + Option makes a shortcut of that folder in the location you drop the icon.",274,690,2012-06-16,AAPL,0.05331173166632652,0.9163455367088318,0.03034280613064766

apple,Apple support...,"Story: A few weeks ago, my audio on my Macbook Air started to cut out randomly, and eventually died completely. ""No problem,"" I think to myself, ""I'm under warranty."" I take my computer to the genius bar, and the guy told me they needed to replace the logic board, but that they would do it for free because I had 30 days of warranty left (dodged a bullet there). 

A few weeks later, I haven't heard anything about my laptop, so I go back in and ask about it. The guy at the genius bar unwraps the laptop and the first thing I notice is that the lid has no dents or scratches. ""Weird that they needed to replace the display to fix my problem.."" I think to myself. 

He turns it over or something and I realize it's a brand new computer. I don't have AppleCare or anything but the computer is just brand spanking new. I'm basically floored at this point, no company has ever done anything like this for me. Anyways, I thank the guy and go on my way. After I get home, I look at the receipt. ""Weird, it says 256 here on model... wait... no way..."" I open up my hard drive's get info and they've doubled the space. 

They replaced my model with one that was probably $200 more, I don't even.

apple,Retina Macbook Pro Gaming Tests (from a former early 2011 17 MBP user),"I picked up the new Retina MBP on tuesday, just thought I'd give some gaming impressions (as they have been absolutely sparce on here) as well as overall thoughts.

In terms of gaming, I have tested the following games at 2880x1800 with vsync (if applicable):
Civilization V : Gods &amp; Kings Expansion Inculded,
Left 4 Dead 2,
Half Life 2,
Crusader Kings II,
Diablo III,
and Minecraft


We will start with CIV, a game near and dear to my heart. The game ran in full resolution, at a steady 50-60 FPS for the first 100 turns - the problem - at full res the text and menus are crazy small (something that also happens with Crusader Kings). CIV is also a game where real slowdown doesnt occur until late game 250+ turns. I had the settings most on med and high, with tesselation low. I turned the resolution down a few (which I remember off hand - 2048x1280 possibly?) and the game was perfect for me in performance and playability.


For the Valve games (LFD2 AND HL2) the performance settings were maxed, No AA and I was at a steady 60 FPS. This was during intense sequences (zombie mobs on screen, explosions in HL). Overall great performance, Valve games arent that intense on a rig, but I was pleasently suprised and the consistent FPS.


For Crusader Kings II, I was playing the Game of Thrones mod (amazing btw). I am new to the game and mechanics, so I will only talk about resolution and performance. It will play at 60FPS on full resolution - but - since this hasnt been optimized, the text and menus are crazy small (A problem I didnt run into on the Valve games or Diablo). I ended up turning down the resolution a bit to make it more playable, like I did with CIV, and I was very happy.


On to Diablo III (wether you like or hate it, dont care). Diablo III ran well at max res, menus were scaled to still be readable and large. I averaged about 30-45 FPS in town, 25-35 in large skirmishes. The only setting I chose to turn down was the shadowing (low). The game looked great on this screen, colors were brilliant (I also have a 60in LG plasma with a windows gaming rig as a comparison).


Minecraft ran at 60, fancy graphics (their actual setting), draw distance far. Fun game, haven't really been engaged in it since the beta, but played well from what I tried.




Overall the screen really has been a huge benefit for me, as a non-power user. It is a pleasure to read the optimized text (which steam is not, so when you first launch it's a great comparison of how bad text can look on it). I come from the 17in MBP, 1920x1200 res (which I love), I was worried I may not enjoy the smaller screen, but it is so damn nice to do anything on.


I went with base, I am a tech junkie so I imagine I'll upgrade again in 2 years and sell this one.


Any questions or more info needed, please ask.

Should I wait for this to happen so I can get the 4S for a cheaper price? How much do the prices generally drop for older models when a new one is released?

&gt; As I mentioned earlier, there are quality implications of choosing the higher-than-best resolution options in OS X. At 1680 x 1050 and 1920 x 1200 the screen is drawn with 4x the number of pixels, elements are scaled appropriately, and the result is downscaled to 2880 x 1800.

It makes no sense to me... I mean, why render 4x the number of pixels if you're going to downscale? What's the point?

For instance, when you choose the best resolution, it's just [1440 x 900] x 2 = 2880 x 1800

So, if you choose say 1920 x 1200, you would just have to multiply by 1,5 and you get 2880 x 1800... What am I missing here?",27,40,2012-06-24,AAPL,0.030667312443256378,0.924382746219635,0.0449499636888504
