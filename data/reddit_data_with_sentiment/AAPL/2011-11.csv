I was just noticing it a while back, and thought that maybe it could use a remodel. This would also mirror Apple's typeface that they use for the iPhone name (as well as all of their other products).

I've also noticed that the current banner seems to be cut off a bit [at the bottom](http://i.imgur.com/BgP0X.png), chopping a bit off of 'reddit'.


Any feedback is much appreciated!

apple,Apple should require all iTunes music come with lyrics.,"I buy most of my music on iTunes, and iCloud has really improved the service. One issue I have is the lack of bundled lyrics.

When you buy a physical album, you usually get a booklet with all of the song's lyrics. I think requiring this would be the equivalent to this.

iphone,A challenge for r/iphone,"Here's what I want you to do. Turn on everything you use regularly.

Do you use location services? Leave them on.
Your phone isn't running the GPS endlessly just because the icon is in your status bar, and location services in iOS 5 have been designed to be super efficient.

Do you use wifi? Turn off network join prompts and leave wifi on.
The phone isn't going to completely drain your battery constantly searching for known wifi networks.

Do you pair with a Bluetooth device regularly? Leave it on.
The same thing as wifi applies.

Stop killing apps from your multitasking tray.
Free RAM is wasted RAM. When you terminate the app, all you're doing is removing its saved state from memory. The system doesn't gobble that RAM up for something else, it sits empty until its called on. If you don't kill apps, it takes RAM from unused apps just as if that RAM was free. All ""killing"" an app does is get rid of its saved state, and make it start from scratch next time you want to use it.

Use your phone like this. Let the phone handle the things it is programmed to handle. I have been running my phone with wifi, BT, and location on all the time. I never kill apps from the tray. My phone gets me through the entire day from 8am to about 10pm.

He said he lost it about 2 and a half weeks ago on his dads motorcycle. He contacted AT&amp;T and they traced it to the road i found it on but he couldn't find it so he cut the phone off and started using his old phone again.

He said thank you; shook my hand, and walked off.

Also this is a thread for tips and tricks tha make navigating the iPad easier.

For mine I like touching the black bar at the top to get to the top of a page, works in more than just Internet browser. 

Another is holding the back button in safari to see previous pages and you can also hold the + to view recently closed tabs.

Then of course you have the four finger swipe between apps and upwards for the recently used apps/music/brightness/mute/volume control and the four finger pinch to get to the home screen.

Another is double tapping the home button when you are in the lock screen to get a quick view of you music playing.

Without missing a beat the employee came back with ""Well, you don't walk into a Ferrari store and complain about the price."" 

My dad now owns a Macbook Air and has never been happier. 

Sorry if this is lame, but I just had to share the awesomeness of seeing my dad speechless for a change.

So I email Wacom and here is their response:

""Hi Radrler,
 
Sorry to hear about your stylus tip. Wacom does sell 3 packs of replacement tips, should they become damaged or wear over time. I would strongly advise checking with the Wacom office in your region, to see what options they may be able to provide.""

I live in Israel and no, I don't think we have anyone here. Haven't found replacement tips online, either. Anyway, I just wanted to give Wacom some bad karma for a shitty product and customer support.

apple,So we've all had a little while. Why don't we all share the iOS 5 shortcuts that you use.,"i have some basics:

-addr: my address

-phnn: my phone number

-usid: my user ID (alexrmay91)

-eml: my email

-stid: my school student ID

-flipt: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

-uflipt: ┬──┬ ﻿ノ( ゜-゜ノ)

-lod: ಠ_ಠ (look of disapproval)

-devsm: ಠ‿ಠ (devious smile)

-all of the usual swear words (if you add them as a phrase without a shortcut, they just get added to your dictionary

-gaga/haga/haba: haha

-mgm: mhm

-hell: hell

-helll: he'll

I also put a lot of my girlfriend's name in there (Hayley), because my phone refuses to acknowledge that it's a name. obviously, you can change this around to suit your troubled names, so:

haykey: Hayley

haykeys: Hayley's

hayley: Hayley

hayleys: Hayley's

So lets hear what you guys have! i'm sure that you've thought of some really clever ones that a lot of people could use.

iphone,I called Apple to complain about my horrible battery life after the 5.0.1 update on my iPhone 4S. Here's what they said...,"On 5.0, I had amazing battery life, hitting close to 40 hours *(edit: total, not standby)* with 7-9 hours of usage regularly. Coming from an Android phone, I was not only astonished but absolutely giddy with this amazing difference. Then I updated to 5.0.1. Suddenly, that long battery life became infuriatingly short. I could barely last half a day. I'd unplug it in the morning at 8am and after some light usage, I'd be charging it on my way home at 6pm. It was very frustrating. So, after fiddling about with Location Services options and other things, I called Apple directly about this.

They asked if I had updated to 5.0.1 via OTA. I responded in the affirmative. Apparently, it seems as if the OTA builds were ""not right"" compared to the ones on the iTunes server. They are separate, it seems. This is what the rep said. He suggested I restore to factory settings and set my iPhone up as new all over again. It would be a hassle, but it might fix my issues. So I did. Last night, I went through the entire 1.5 hour long process. I charged the iPhone completely and unplugged it last night before going to sleep.

I woke up to 97% left with almost 7 hours of standby with 15 minutes of usage. I know it's not a lot of usage, but before, I was hitting ~85% or worse with the same amount of time of standby/usage. I'm at work right now, I have about 90% left with 1 hour of usage and almost 11 hours of standby. That's almost 12 hours of *very* light usage for 10% loss. That's amazing compared to what I was getting before.

I'm going to update my battery life later today as I'm at work right now and won't really get to test the iPhone too much.

If you try it, please share your experiences. Hope this helps someone =)

**TL;DR -- Apple rep suggested this: ""If you took the OTA and your amazing battery life got worse, try restoring and updating via iTunes directly.""**

Alright, to all 3 of you who are still reading:

I also wrote a Gmail app, and it got approved at roughly the same time as the official Gmail app. (Bad timing, eh?)

The main difference is this app is more ""native"" (as in, it's not a re-skinned version of gmail.com wrapped inside an app), the UI is more responsive, and it supports multiple accounts.

iphone,Caution: iPhone 4S Moisture Sensors are easy to trip.,"Yesterday I went into the Apple store to get my phone replaced for what I thought was a manufactural defect (my screen went dark but every other part of my phone worked..Siri, phone calls/text messages ((sent/received and dictated by Siri)), sounds, music, charger, plug in, etc). Though I've ran into a few manufactural defects before with the other models, Apple has been really, really good at owning up and replacing it on the spot. 

Went in yesterday, got to the genius, genius then checks out the phone, looks woefully up at me and says: ""you've gotten this phone wet at some point; the moisture sensor is tripped.""...I don't believe this. I've had this phone for a little over 3 weeks and it has rarely left my hand, and has been in a defender series Otter Box that was put on it, IN THE STORE, at checkout (I've broken my other iphones, I wasn't fucking around with this one). 

I bought Apple care, but was then told that since the moisture sensor was tripped, it was now classified as ""accidental damage"" and could be replaced for $200 (for the 32g) as an ""accidental damage replacement fee""--while obviously better than the $800+ cost of a new phone outright, still expensive for a nursing student (a real day ruiner). 

So I'm posting this as a warning to you fellow iPhone owners. CAREFUL. After a little research, I guess tripping these sensors (located in the headphone jack and in the middle of the charger port) is easier than one would think. Sweaty pockets, steamy showers/bathrooms, even a single raindrop that doesn't submerge the phone, can trip a sensor and leave the phone unaffected--but void the warranty or reclassify the damage classification under apple care plans. Save yourself the money/hassle/bank account dispair. 

**EDIT**: I Have AppleCare+ (It's the only thing you can buy in terms of AppleCare for 4S, I know.) On hold to speak with an Apple rep regarding the issue, update to follow. 

**TL;DR**: Had a manufactural defect, went to replace 3 week old defense-series-otterboxed-4S, was told moisture sensor was tripped even with no history of water contact. Apple Care charges $200 for replacement. BEWARE.",60,69,2011-11-21,AAPL,0.08331695199012756,0.889619767665863,0.027063289657235146

I have never owned a mac before and i would like to know if this is a decent deal.

Based on a brief conversation i had over the phone with the clerk I believe it is the M9032LL/A version, which appears to be on the higher end. I came to this conclusion by viewing specs for the variations of that model HERE:    http://support.apple.com/kb/sp96

The reason i want it is to use it for home audio production.
Will it suffice?
Is it worth it?
and, as a side, would my son be able to play Minecraft on it?

A couple other questions I have are about upgrading it.

Is upgrading a mac the same as upgrading a pc?
can i just switch out the audio and graphics cards like i would a pc?

apple,Why has the OSX community rallied around a source based package manager (Macports)?  Wouldn't binaries make more sense?,"I've recently switched to OSX from Linux.  Macports is really important to me.  I'm very glad that we have a robust package manager in Macports that lets us run Linux/Unix software.

But I don't really understand why we're all using a source code based package manager.  Wouldn't it make more sense for us to download binaries?

I think the BSD ports system evolved to handle a lot of diversity in hardware that doesn't exist in the Apple ecosystem.

I'm thinking about this mostly because I've downloaded Xcode twice this weekend, at 1.8GB per pop, once on my mini and once on my laptop.",26,23,2011-11-27,AAPL,0.02068359963595867,0.933332622051239,0.04598374292254448

The original one I curated...as in I just found tones and put them together into a set. Well, for most of the new ones, I took clips and made whole new tone sets. I even made a custom wallpaper for the Space Core (because I couldn't find a good one).

So...here they are. Four new and updated tone sets with matching wallpapers for a complete Portal experience. ENJOY!
