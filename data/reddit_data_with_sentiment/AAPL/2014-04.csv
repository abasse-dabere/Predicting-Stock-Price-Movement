iphone,Anyone else annoyed with how Google's apps handle sign-ins lately?,"So, context: I have All Access on my Play Music account, and like I did when I had Spotify, me and my girlfriend both share the account.

EDIT: According to a few down below, Spotify actually doesn't allow sharing. Weird, because I thought it did. But I stand corrected. Oh well.

Anyway, it used to be that I'd be able to sign my girlfriend into Play Music with my Google account, and everything would be absolutely fine. She could go about using her other Google Apps (gmail, etc) without any negative consequences. She *could* add my account to Gmail with a few taps, but until she did so, Gmail remained blissfully unaware of my Google account and didn't even bother touching it.

Not anymore, it would seem. She fired up Gmail after an update, and it automatically added my account and began notifying her whenever an email came in on my account, and added it to her account switcher as well. She tried to remove my account from Gmail so it would no longer bother her about my account, but then it nuked my account *entirely* from her phone.

I go to add it back, and again, it gives Gmail *full, unfettered access* to my account. Notifications and all.

So it would seem that there's no way to use one Google account on **one** Google app on an iPhone anymore. You either give *every* Google app full access to your Google account, or you give none. Which is absolutely infuriating.

Is anyone else peeved by this? Furthermore, has anyone found a way to defeat this?",22,64,2014-04-02,AAPL,0.05471029877662659,0.9201859831809998,0.02510368824005127

apple,"Hey, Soundbite here, back with the update minimal icon set I showed off a few weeks ago with changes based on feedback from you guys!","[Here's a screenshot of the new icons](http://i.imgur.com/7soDx2R.png).

[And here's a link to the original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/20uvyr/so_i_made_myself_a_cleaner_minimal_osx_icon_set/).

**CHANGELOG**

* Made the tilt on the Mail icon upright and adjusted the color to match the iOS 7 colors.
* Updated the Reminders app with a design that mixes the best of both iOS7's and OSX's Reminders design.
* Made the Notes page more than just two rectangles, and again, took note of iOS7's Notes icon.
* Slightly changed the color for the iTunes icon and made the music note optically centered.
* Optically centered the App Store icon.
* Changed the 16 x 9 aspect on the old iPhoto icon to something less wide; redid the camera.
* Made the gradient on the GarageBand icon more subtle.
* Made QuickTime Player's colors closer to the original OSX design's colors.
* Removed the two side-gears on System Preferences and remade the grey to match iOS7's Settings icon's shade of grey, gradient included.
* Changed the size of the blue circle in the middle of Chrome by just a tiny bit.
* Thinned the blue path on Maps and added a location-marker.
* Made the colors on Google Drive less harsh. The original icon was just an experiment with color brightness anyways and shouldn't have been the final version to begin with.
* Made the gradient on Pocket a warmer tone.
* Changed the arrangement of the Game Center bubbles, they weren't layered properly.
* Made the background square on Steam green and tilted it.
* Changed the color of the Dolphin icon to a brighter and deeper blue.
* Made Roblox Studio/Roblox's colors less harsh.

In addition to all these changes, I'm just about done with creating replacements for all of the Utilities applications, as well as some icons for applications for you guys to use, like Microsoft Office, VLC, Final Cut Pro, Firefox, and more.

I'll be back soon with the finished up Utilities Launchpad page, and back again with more comment requests/icon modifications later.

ipad,Styli - Convert your thoughts into writing,"I have owned 3 different stylus that I have used to take notes with on my iPad using Notes Plus. The 3 stylus I have owned are the **Wacom Bamboo**, **Adonit Jot Pro**, and the **GoSmart Stylus**. Although I have enjoyed each stylus, I am not sure I am quite satisfied as my ""ultimate stylus"" seems to be eluding me. I am an Engineering student so most of my notes are short equations and scribbles that take some concentration and I have found little quirks with each of these stylus that has kept me on the hunt for one that will suite me.

The point of this thread is basically a short review on each of these stylus in the off chance you are on the same search as I am. In turn I think it be great for others to post about what styli they have owned and right short reviews on them to aid others in search of the perfect stylus.

**Wacom Bamboo**

Pros: 
I enjoy the silkiness of the way the bamboo glides across the screen even though all logic tells me the rubber-ish tip should create a lot of friction with the glass of the iPad. The thinnest is actually something I did enjoy and the build quality did seem sturdy. It took little to no pressure for the tip to pick up my markings and with quick strokes I was able to convey my thoughts on screen almost effortlessly.

Cons:
The tip after heavy (5 days a week/8 weeks) began to show signs of tearing. Something I would have expected due to the aforementioned friction issue but the amount of friction was so miniscule that my case maybe an outlier. The stylus to this day continues to work despite the damage and it is currently my used as my back up.

**Adonit Jot Pro**

Pros:
This definitely is the most aesthetically pleasing and eye catching out of the group of 3. The Jot Pro was comfortable to hold but that is generally where the upside for me ended.

Cons: 
The clear disk did not travel as smoothly and even drawing a simple line resulted in 3 separate lines as the disk would not register causing a break in the illustration. The technology that is used for the disk to register also created some static electricity effect where dust and lint would gather on the disk creating a unpleasant look and upon further use possible damage to the screen.

DISCAIMER: This is semi biased as I had used the Bamboo prior so I had high expectations on what I required. Adonit also makes many higher end stylus with Bluetooth connectivity which may totally change the behavior of the stylus. 

**GoSmart**

Pros:
I have never lost connectivity with this stylus although it seems to share the same technology as the Jot Pro. I do enjoy the ease of use of the GoSmart and it brings back the sensitive tip of the Bamboo that I greatly enjoyed. Its build quality is very high and it was basically the upgrade to the bamboo I was looking for and is currently my daily driver for stylus.

Cons:
My one gripe is that because it is a disk you must hold the stylus so the disk is parallel with the scree. There is a spring which gives some wrist flexibility but I always seem to be uncomfortable when I am taking notes and on multiple occasions access the multi touch gestures even with the palm rest activated. Something I do not recall doing with the Bamboo.

I believe my personal rankings would be GoSmart &gt; Bamboo &gt; Jot Pro. This is solely my opinion and I would appreciate any input that can be given back. I think my next stylus I will looking into would be the Cosmonaut or the AluPen (not sure of the name but it has a rubber tip and aluminum body similar to a carpenters pencil). If anyone has reviews on those or any stylus I think this would be a good thread for people to share and make educated buying decisions on their first/next stylus.

**TL/DR:** IMO GoSmart &gt; Bamboo &gt; Jot Pro. Leave your own reviews, especially if its about the cosmonaut.

Thanks!",18,28,2014-04-04,AAPL,0.06163184717297554,0.9055710434913635,0.032797105610370636

apple,Apple replaced my iPad mini for free. Tips for others who may get in same situation one day.,"*NOTE: THIS IS NOT TELLING OTHERS HOW TO GET FREE THINGS. IT IS LETTING OTHERS KNOW THAT APPLE HAS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO COME BY THESE DAYS*


This may not happen to anyone else but if you have bad luck like me, it just might. (But hopefully you get a good outcome like me.)

I want to begin to say that I have many Apple products that I take very good care of. What happened to me is out of the ordinary. I was definitely very upset by how it was shattered. I will state that I was not being careless. I was walking and tripped while holding the iPad. Yes, clumsy. No, not careless. Just bad luck.

I purchased an iPad mini with retina display. Did not purchase Apple Care just yet because I knew I had 30 days from date of purchase to make that decision and wanted to wait a week or two before spending another 100 bucks because my wallet needed a break. 

Well, seven days go by and my iPad mini is dropped and shattered because I tripped. (Like how I mentioned above.) 

Well, I decided to call Apple. Apple said that without Apple care I could get it replaced/fixed for $249 dollars. No thanks, said my wallet.
So I try chatting with Apple online. Same discussion and same sad news: $249 dollars. Wallet is sad once again.

(You can imagine how angry I was with myself.)

I did some more research and stumbled upon an Apple topic on Reddit. A Redditor stated that it is best to always ask for a store manager at the Apple Store you purchased the product from. So, I did.

I went to the store in person and asked for a store manger. I did not demand anything but just simply (and calmly) told him my situation and he offered the replacement for free. It was amazing. It came packaged and everything. Brand new. I am astonished still. 

If this happens to anyone else (I hope not) be sure to go in person and ask for a store manager. Don't settle for Apple calls/chats. Always talk in person.

Hope this helps someone in the future. It saved me a lot of money and I am very thankful for Apple and their amazing service. 

P.S.
Yes, I did purchase Apple Care after this incident.

One day, the APPreciation threads here disappeared, I opened a thread asking why, and I was told that it was useless, and it was going to be replaced by a monthly thread.

I haven't seen that monthly thread. So here it's a new APPreciation thread. I hope that the mods won't go mad at me. I hope that we'll see some new and useful apps. Let's start!

apple,"Has anyone used the ""Summarize"" feature built in to OS X? If so, how has your experience with it been?","It's not that well known of a feature, but OS X has a built in summarize feature where (once enabled) any block of text you highlight can be summarized for you. I need to do a report on the Windsor-Detroit tunnel and didn't feel like going through *all* the information that I found on the construction (considering I already had gone through all the information about it since the construction), so I used the summarize function and, holy shit, it worked just like you would want it to! It was able to get the key information and chop a really long article down into the key info for me with ease. Once you open the summarize tool than you are given a window with all the highlighted text, and a slider at the bottom to adjust depending on how much detail you want. (Ranging from 1% to 100%). Naturally, the more detail the longer the summary will be. I adjusted it to around 50 or 60 percent and found that the info it gave me was to the point and did a good job of summarizing everything. It gets saved as a rich text document in text edit and can then be copied to a better program (I just pasted into Pages). Anyway, I didn't even know this feature existed until a few days ago when a friend mentioned it to me. Just wondering if any of you have used it and what the results have been like for you. 

Oh, I may as well mention how to enable it. Just go into 'System Preferences', then 'Keyboard', click the 'Shortcuts' tab, and then the 'Services' sub section on the left hand side. Scroll down until you see 'Summarize' and click the check box to enable it. You don't need to add a keyboard shortcut, just so long as the box is checked off. Now I'm not sure what programs this can be used with, I'll just use Safari as an example. Go to any article with lots of text, highlight the whole thing, and navigate to the bar at the top of the screen. Click &lt;*program name*&gt;, in my case Safari, hover over 'Services' and click 'Summarize'. Then you will get the text edit window with the 'Summary Size' slider at the bottom, and an option to have it formatted into just sentences, or paragraphs.

Plus, their buttons don't even scale to the retina display.

Are we being trolled by Microsoft, or are the engineers responsible for the port really that incompetent?

apple,I am really disappointed in this subreddit.,"After a recent post made the front page with a misleading headline and an even worse article, tons of misinformed comments started rolling in hating on Apple for being ""hypocritical"" on patenting the ""android"" swipe unlock in a certain patent application that has recently come to light.

 The title of this post was ""Apple Tries To Patent Android's Gestural Unlocking System"". The title is terribly misleading and the article fails to mention some important details, but I'll get to that in a bit. Some of these comments even came in from other subreddits that are known for hating on Apple such as /r/Technology and /r/Android (Although I rarely visit, I'm sure the sub has a great community but you cannot deny how bad some of those [comments were] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/23ge4b/apple_tries_to_patent_androids_gestural_unlocking/cgws7do).) This was extremely frustrating to read because all of the same types of comments were being upvoted, and anything that wasn't hating on Apple were downvoted. I found this to be extremely bad for an actual discussion on the subject at hand to take place. I've made numerous comments trying to explain why Apple had submitted this patent and most of them were vaguely replied too or not upvoted for visibility while the more circle-jerkish ones were up top. 

This patent application was filed back in 2012. The headline (which is only what a lot of commenters read) made it seem like they just tried to patented it. As 9toMac's Mark Gurman tweeted earlier, the application for the patent was in fact not for a lock screen, but for authentication for internal apps within Apple. Some have even said how they've [seen Geniuses use it](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/23gpb5/apple_tries_to_patent_androids_gestural_unlocking/cgx0aq8). Apple has used this system for authenticating user logins internally among a variety of applications (who knows how many) including EasyPay. 

The reason I made this post was to clear up some confusion among /r/Apple readers and all around Apple fans as well who were ""disappointed"" as many pointed out in the original /r/Apple post comment thread. Thank you for reading if you made it this far! Tell me what you think in the comments and please let me know if i missed out anything or made any errors :)

iphone,Is my boyfriend's 5s done with or is there something we haven't tried?,"There's nothing really online that we can find that's specific to the problem, any help is appreciated. He received a replacement phone from an insurance claim, but we were surprised that it didn't look like a ""refurbished"" phone, it was in a sealed box with all the accessories. The insurance company told us we would have to go through our provider (Sprint) if any issues came up with the phone.

My boyfriend tried plugging his phone in to charge. Then it started to bring up the Apple logo and then the screen would go black. It does this over and over every ten seconds or so, even once he unplugged it. While the screen was black, my boyfriend plugged it into his laptop and was able to put it into recovery mode so he could restore it to factory settings. It booted up and prompted a new phone set up, he set it up as a new phone and seemed to be working. He plugged it back into the laptop and was going to restore to an iCloud backup from yesterday and as soon as he plugged it back in, it turned itself off and started doing the Apple logo/black screen over and over again.

He also mentioned it will boot up if he restores it and plugs it into the wall. There's no water damage and he hasn't been rough with the phone.

We currently live in a really, really small town. The nearest Sprint store is 3 hours away and the nearest Apple store is even farther. We'd like to be able to resolve this ourselves if possible. 

Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks!

*ETA: Thank you everyone for your input! We contacted Apple and the customer service was totally painless. We'll be sending the phone back to a repair/replacement (if necessary).

iphone,Iphone 5S battery problems,"Hi guys,

I've had my Iphone 5S for about two months now. At first it was great, it is a really fast smarthphone and the battery was more than decent. After a few weeks however, I noticed a decline in battery life. After a while I had to fully charge it 3-4 times a day.So I contacted my carrier and they took my phone in for repair. All they did was do a software update (I understand that a newer IOs can increase battery life, but not like 300%). 

So I contacted Apple directly and they made an appointment with UPS to pick up my phone for repairs again. Before it was picked up, my battery died while going out and afterwards it wouldn't turn on at all anymore. The Apple repair center replaced my battery and send it back. My phone would turn on again but still had an awfull battery life.

So I contacted Apple again and they suggested I'd take my phone to the Apple Genius bar to have it checked out. They did the diagnostic test and concluded that the battery is fine and gave me a lot of tips to improve my battery life. They suggested I'd turn off 4G when not needing it, turning on airplane mode while on Wi-Fi and some other things.

Afterwards I came home, did a factory reset and didn't install any apps. Followed all their suggestions but I still have like 5 hours of stand-by time. 

I'm starting to get a bit desperate, as my mobile phone isn't excactly mobile now. I always have to carry a charger and a battery pack. Does anyone have a suggestion I could try, or should I contact Apple again. Is it possible that there is still a hardware defect in my phone?",39,55,2014-04-20,AAPL,0.05897483974695206,0.904140293598175,0.036884840577840805

apple,iTunes Match is buggy and unreliable,"I've been using iTunes Match since the very beginning. 

Like many new services, it had some issues during rollout, but I assumed things would get fixed in subsequent updates. Sure enough, some of the glaring issues were fixed, but three years later I'm pretty unimpressed with quality of the service.

1) playlist syncing - missing updates to playlists, not syncing a new playlist across devices, orphaned playlists, or incredibly slow playlist sync (between several hours to a full day to update “recently added playlist”)

2) Editing Album artwork / metadata - Changing the album art or metadata to a song (album name, artist, etc) is completely unreliable. Edits to songs are sporadically rolled back to old information or old artwork. 


3) Adding new music to my library - Uploading or matching new music to iCloud can take forever. I’ve seen it take between 30 minutes to over a day to add a single song to iTunes. 


Whenever I’m really bored, or feeling particularly annoyed that I’m paying for a premium service that has had bugs for years, I’ll call Apple support to report these problems. I normally get a nice person who goes through the basic troubleshooting steps (turn off iTunes Match on all devices, and turn it back on). Sometimes this fixes my problems, and sometimes it doesn’t. My real issue is that even if their troubleshooting steps fix my problems, why isn’t Apple resolving the underlying bugs in its service?

I’m not trying to start a discussion about the features we wish iTunes Match had, or how Spotify / other pay-per-month service is the future. I’m trying to find out if other people, who are using the iTunes Match service, are consistently experiencing bugs on an almost daily basis.",176,307,2014-04-21,AAPL,0.12275046855211258,0.8510542511940002,0.026195209473371506

apple,iOS 7.1.1 Behind the scenes of touch ID,"Touch ID takes a 88x88 500ppi scan of your finger and temporarily sends that data to a secure cache located near the RAM, after the data is vectorized and forwarded to the secure enclave located on the top left of the A7 near the M7 processor it is immediately discarded after processing. The fingerprint scanner uses subdermal ridge flows (inner layer of skin) to prevent loss of accuracy if you were to have micro cuts or debris on your finger.

With iOS 7.1.1 Apple now takes multiple scans of each position you place finger at setup instead of a single one and uses algorithms to predict potential errors that could arise in the future. Touch ID was supposed to gradually improve accuracy with every scan but the problem was if you didn't scan well on setup it would ruin your experience until you re-setup your finger. iOS 7.1.1 not only removes that problem and increases accuracy but also greatly reduces the calculations your iPhone 5S had to make while unlocking the device which means you should get a much faster unlock time.

The purchase of authentec has given Apple a huge future advantage and touch ID is most likely a temporary place holder of a future display with an embedded fingerprint sensor

Then, the app works like a QR scanner and any time that the app scans that particular object the video or audio you recorded will play. 

I'd like to use this so that my students can do short book reviews and then other students can scan that book and hear or watch a student's review of the book to help them decide to read or not. Thanks for your help reddit!

iphone,iPhone 4...to Windows Phone 8...back to iPhone 4,"In 2009 I got an iPhone 4 and loved it.  iTunes + the iOS app store had everything I needed.  I used this up until 2013 where I switched to WP8.  I was very into the UI of windows phone the simplicity etc.  But I found that the WP is still severely lacking in anything that I would hope to expect from a modern smartphone.  Below is a list of things that had I researched before I would never have touched the WP I bought.  WP sucks, don't believe the hype

1. NO APPS.  nuff said..... the iOS app store is the first to get the latest and greatest in the app world.  While the windows phone store is full of nothing but fake apps and Rudy Hyun (The only person on the planet that is dedicated to creating and supporting WP apps apparently) The whole reason we love smart phones...AM I RITE&gt;???

2. Basic built in features on WP suck.  Texts often wouldn't send, Internet Explorer sucks donkey balls.  Oh and there is no default map feature that I could get to work well.  AND MOST OF ALL.   The worst thing in the world is the default music player for the windows phone....BY DEFAULT.. I repeat...BY DEFAULT the music player will fade out of the current track and fade into the next track when play/pausing, skipping tracks, or simply letting the music player play....WTF.  Also no feature to change this..just MS taking a shit on you while you jam out...or attempt to...to your favorite djams.

2. iTunes compatibility is a joke.  MS says they can emulate it with the windows phone desktop app....nothing close enough to even resemble the awesomeness of iTunes

3. I own a pebble smartwatch...no WP compatibility...shocker

4. Google support is more fluid on the iOS platform...I am heavily invested in google's services and found it difficult to use my gmail account for most everything on the phone...had to create a stupid outlook account..I felt gross doing it.

That being said I switched back to my old 16gb iPhone 4 running iOS 7.1.1 and honestly it is a proper smart phone, unlike my retarded HTC 8x.  

I guess there is a reason why my iPhone 4 is worth $100.00 to Verizon as a resale phone, while my 8x is worth a whopping 18 bucks...god damnit MS.  There are too many other reasons why WP pisses me off. 

TL;DR = WP has no support and is inept at performing basic smartphone tasks.  Going back to iPhone.

Needless to say, I am up for upgrade come next February...iPhone 6 anyone?",96,88,2014-04-25,AAPL,0.034521859139204025,0.9240683317184448,0.04140985757112503
apple,"The iOS 7 holdouts of /r/apple, what's your reason for not upgrading?","[According to Apple's own usage stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/), 87% of iOS users have upgraded to iOS 7 already, with 11% staying on iOS 6 and the last 2% still using iOS 5 or below. I'm assuming the last 2% are from devices that can't be upgraded to a more recent OS.

Now, it's my personal opinion (I can't stress this enough. I'm not trying to start a flame war here) that since the minor updates fixed some performance issues on the older devices, sped up animations, included toggles for the more controversial UI glitz and made the OS stable again, there's really no reason to hold out anymore. But, obviously, a not insignificant percentage of people still haven't upgraded and I assume most of these people fall into one of two camps

1. Jailbreakers who don't want to lose their tweaks.
2. People who just don't like the way iOS 7 looks.

So, my main two questions are:

* Are you in camp 1, camp 2, or neither? What's your reason for not upgrading?
* If you're in camp 2, what is your long term plan? Everyone expects Apple to keep the design language of iOS 7 intact in iOS 8 and beyond, and some even expect OS X 10.10 to take some cues from it. Are you hoping on some minor tweaks that would win you over? Will you just hold out until your next iPhone forces the upgrade on you? Or will you switch to Android or Windows Phone?

**EDIT** It seems that there's a rather large 3rd camp of iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s users who don't want to upgrade because of responsiveness complaints, though there's a lot of arguing over whether this is actually the case or not. On a related note, I really do believe that iOS 7 was designed with a larger screen in mind and that the UI looks ever so slightly squished on the smaller screens. Also, iOS 7 brought all the non-hardware dependent upgrades (like TouchID or slo-mo camera) to iPhone 5, but hardly any to iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s, so they might not be very compelled to make the switch.",175,83,2014-04-25,AAPL,0.03179888799786568,0.9160280823707581,0.05217300355434418

iphone,"Just released an iPhone app for solo travellers, been working on it for a while! Looking for feedback. (x-post from r/startups)","Having travelled alone for almost all of last year, I realized there is no good app for solo travellers looking for a travel buddy, aside from couchsurfing which I find doesn't have a very well developed app at all. So me and a friend I met travelling decided to develop an app, I've done all the design work and we outsourced the coding.

We feel this app will be great for those who already travel, but it's a useful aid for motivating people who normally wouldn't feel comfortable travelling alone.

Our landing page is at www.backpackr.org and the app is now live at https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/backpackr/id860191256?mt=8
Basically the app allows you to see others nearby your location and those travelling to the same country/city you're going to during the same time, and then you can message them and travel with them if you decide to.

We also added virtual passport feature where you collect stamps for every country you check in too, we remade over 200 stamps from actual passports.

We're in a public beta phase so we're looking for some feedback, obviously if you're not travelling this app isn't really useful to you, but we plan on implementing some features that locals can use as a sort of ""host"" to their city.

Any ideas what could have happened and does anyone know if I have any recourse to get a replacement from AT&amp;T or Apple? I'm the original owner, had the phone about 2 years. The cable, and connector, was perfect...no bends, cracks, frayed wiring or anything. I'm totally puzzled how this could happen. Would appreciate any feedback, suggestions you may have ASAP. I have to replace it right away.


EDIT UPDATE - I forgot I could edit my 1st post. This is what I said earlier: Thank you for the advice. I went to the Apple store, explained what happened and they were willing to replace the phone with another 4s...one with 8 gigs less, saying that was the best they could do given that the phone was over two years old (while implying they were doing me a favor). They made it clear that replacement of a ""like model"" was the extent of what they were allowed - and they have only 8 gig models.

I was very polite and told them they should replace my phone with a 5s...I was stared at as if I had said something unreasonable or retarded. Those Apple guys tend to be a bit uppity, at least at the local store. So I have a new 4s with only half the storage space. Guess that's just how it goes.

mac,"Is it just me, or does Apple Mail still completely blow with Gmail?","I have a work-provided MBP and a personal MBP, both running current Mavericks (including the update that was supposedly meant to improve this), and on both of them, Mail.app is a complete disaster with Gmail.

The biggest thing, I guess, is that it'll just quit getting mail. Happens most days, and sometimes right-clicking the inbox and saying ""Synchronize"" makes it pull new goods, sometimes Mailbox &gt; Get All New Mail works, and sometimes I have to quit and relaunch Mail to get it looking at Gmail again.

Any tips? I haven't heard people screaming about it in a while, so maybe there's a fix I missed?
