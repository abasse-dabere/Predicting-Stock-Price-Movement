apple,"R.I.P. Clickwheel, you died before your time.","Maybe a new smaller/thiner iPod classic will come along and fill the void left by the old iPod Nano. Hell, they can call it an iPod Mini for all I care.

I find this new Nano to be the death of my favorite iPod. Either a new Nano sized ""Classic"" will come out later, or it won't, and I'll run this Nano ragged until it's death. Beyond that, it looks like I'll be considering other players.
New iPod nano, *without* video viewing, *without* a video camera, *without* built in audio recording, presumably *also* without games, and a microscopic screen. Sounds like a downgrade.

In the keynote, when they showed the current Nano and visually chopped off the clickwheel, implying a similarly sized rectangular touch screen, I was interested. Then they were like ""Oh wait, it's actually this tiny-ass square piece of shit.""

**Edit:** Not to mention the draw back of no longer being able to simply reach into your pocket and change a song without having to dig it out and take a look. Also of intrest... does this tiny thing even have lyric support? I live and die by lyric support, personally. Also, though admitably not very useful, the internal speaker in the current Nano is occasionally handy.

Here's how to remove them (mac only), since Apple has taken out the preference.

Close iTunes, open terminal, copy paste:



defaults write com.apple.iTunes show-store-arrow-links -bool FALSE



Close terminal. That's it. If you need to go back, copy paste the same thing only change it to TRUE.

iphone,Alien Blue possible design variation? Your thoughts? [PIC],"TL/DR: Possible change to toolbars. [Large Pic of example.](http://imgur.com/ToaxS.jpg)  Like it, or dislike it?

--------

Hi everyone,

I hope you don't mind this post in /r/iphone.  I would post in /r/alienblue, but there's a lot more people using AB than those subscribed the Alien Blue subreddit, and I wanted to open feedback up to a much wider audience for something like this.

The overall layout of AB has been playing on my mind.  Although the full-screen option allows a much wider viewing area, my use of **toolbars** has been less than ideal.

Rather than force a change on everyone, I decided to create some mock-ups of what I had in mind and get some feedback as to whether this would be a welcomed change or an unnecessary and frustrating one.

Here's a rough mockup showing how the toolbars would be utilised on the different screens:

WARNING: Large 310kb jpeg

http://imgur.com/ToaxS.jpg

Full-screen would still be available across the entire app.  The messages and settings would slide up (rather than requiring their own tabs).  It would support an orangered envelope when you have new messages.  This would also allow a clean introduction to Safari-esque forward/back navigation in the browser.

So let me know if you like it or dislike it, and whether or not this layout would cause stress to the way you already interact with Alien Blue.

Cheers!

** Edit: ** Please ignore the actual content between the toolbars.  For example, the comments in these mockups show the **voting icons** next to the comments, and these are actually disabled by default (can be toggled on in 1.0.6).",53,77,2010-09-04,AAPL,0.035785987973213196,0.9279415011405945,0.03627251833677292

iphone,Someone Stole my iPhone 4 yesterday... you'll love this!,"I knew it was missing within 60 seconds of him taking off with it... I grabbed my iPad and located my iPhone.  It was in the driveway... just happened to be where his truck was parked.  I had already called the cops at this point and he was trying to leave and my friends wouldn't let him and one friend was just saying ""Just give him the phone back!"" and the guy kept saying ""I didn't steal his phone"".  I then said we'll let the cops settle this because they are right there down the block headed this way.  He promptly handed my phone back to a friend that was near him and the cop shows up and he tells the cop ""I thought that was my phone"".  Cop promptly arrests the guy and takes him away... leaving his girlfriend behind trying give me an apology for all this and I promptly tell her ""It would be a wise idea if you left because I don't want you here"".

Better yet.. I have him on video taking the phone to his truck and coming back to the porch following the whole event.  Video isn't all that clear.

Anyway long story short... being aware and mobile me saved my iPhone.  

PS: I kinda knew the guy he worked for the company that installed my windows in my house a few months back... I called his job today and they informed me he was fired a few months back.

apple,Does anyone here use a hackintosh?,"I'm thinking about building one in the near future. I have a couple of official macs already. A MacMini as my HTPC running boxee hooked up to a tv. And my MBP paired with a 24 inch monitor for web development/design/general use.

I want a desktop because now that I'm out of college, I find myself using my MBP less and less outside of the house, so why not opt for a desktop with more power at home. I thought about an imac, but I just don't find them a good value proposition. Especially since I already have a nice screen as is, and plan on getting another one for using dual displays and don't want to be stuck with the same imac screen when I want to upgrade or change later on.

The macpro's while certainly powerful are simply way to expensive for my taste. I know the prices for the hardware you're getting are not all that more expensive then if you built a similar pro-workstation machine from dell/HP/etc... but I think that's only because they just updated them fairly recently (in mac time).'

I have a rough idea of the hardware I'll be using. 

*850w power supply

*core i7

*ATI 5770

*6gb of ram

and the tricky part is finding a compatible motherboard but I'm sure it can be done.

I wouldn't want to spend all the money aiming for hardware that's as close as possible be as stable as can be, but for it all to meltdown anyway.",29,13,2010-09-06,AAPL,0.024221787229180336,0.92645263671875,0.04932563379406929

apple,"Mac ownership on my college campus is skyrocketing. Its causing some issues though, and I could use some feedback","I'll get right to it, the number of students coming to college with Macs is increasing a LOT every year. This year is no exception. I do tech work for the college within the University I attend, so this directly impacts me. Some of the classes within the business college require Windows. There is no way around it. Specifically, one class that ALL business freshman must take requires IE, Access, etc.

This means we need all of the students to have Windows on their Macs. It is required for in-class work. Not my decision, but thats the way it is. As a tech employee for the technology program it is our job to help students get Windows on their Macs. This is where things get tricky.

What is the best option? They can purchase Windows for $35, so thats not a big deal. The problem is how to run it. Which method do you all think is best, and why?

* Boot Camp - **Pros**: Native performance, assistant comes with OS X, fairly simple. **Cons**: Some students have had their Macs for a while and they are unable to partition their drives without reinstallling OS X first. We aren't able to assist 50+ students a semester with reinstalling OS X and restoring data.

* VMware Fusion - **Pros**: Works well in my experiences. **Cons**: Yet another additional cost for students who are already paying for Windows and Office. We can't force all students to buy the software.

* Parallels - **Same as VMware Fusion**

* VirtualBox - **Pros**: Works great in my experiences. Free. **Cons**: No dedicated support.

I would like to hear your feedback on which method you think is best. We want to be consistent, this is why I ask. We don't want to tell one student to go buy Parallels, another to use VMware Fusion, and another to use Boot Camp. We would like to keep it to one or two simple options to keep confusion down (and hopefully costs).

This of course makes me favor Boot Camp for students with new Macs who can partition and if they can't, VirtualBox. Has anyone here experienced any major issues with VirtualBox? 

Thanks /r/apple

PS: I'm rocking the i7 15"" MBP and loving it! :)

**Edit**: I appreciate all of he replies. I just want to clarify a few things. First off, students pay us a technology fee every semester. That fee goes to some MSDNAA licensing, lab costs, laptop checkout costs, and paying student workers. Because they pay this fee we want to help them with putting Windows on their Macs as needed. The main University IT department also provides this service but it runs the students around $47 an hour, we do it for free as they have paid their fees to us. 

Also laptops are REQUIRED at our college. We require all students to own one, and also have told Mac users countless times before they start school that they NEED Windows on their Macs for some classes.

We never take laptops in. Students can't drop their laptops off to us and pick them up later. Instead, we sit down with them one on one and show them how to use Boot Camp (or VirtualBox so far). We teach them instead of just doing it for them as knowing how to put Windows on a Mac is important. 

Finally, I obviously cannot make curriculum changes. I am not the one teaching these classes. And the fact is that corporate America still uses Windows so it would be a disservice to the students to graduate them without teaching them the software they will be seeing when they get jobs. We can't put our disdain for Microsoft before the education of the paying students. My goal is to find a solution that costs the least amount of money and provides the best experience for the students with minimal risk of data lost. I know backups are important, but I would bet that 80% of students never backup their data and we don't have the resources to get into that fight right now. I personally encourage Dropbox use for all important class data, but thats a discussion for another day.

Thanks again.

**Edit 2**: I appreciate the feedback, however I didn't start this discussion with the intent of it turning into  ""why Mac's should be in corporate America"" or ""your school should teach cross platform stuff only"" discussion. I understand everyone here would prefer curriculum that is not Windows centered, however that isn't my call. The fact is that in a business college Windows will indeed be required for some stuff. Thats the business world, and I didn't create the rules.",108,47,2010-09-11,AAPL,0.05292340740561485,0.9173457622528076,0.02973076142370701

Hi everyone,


As some of you may know, I've been busily working on an iPad version for Alien Blue.  Well Apple just approved it!  I thought I would also answer some of the questions that others have asked on various threads.

----------------------------------------------------

** How is Alien Blue HD different to Safari for browsing Reddit? **

I wanted Alien Blue on the iPad to be a very different experience when using Reddit.  I have developed the entire browser experience around a sidebar that allows a fast and intuitive way to switch between subreddits, posts and comments without having to move back and forth between screens.  It's been designed so that you always have context without needing to open multiple tabs in the background.  I hope you'll enjoy using it as much as I enjoy developing it.

----------------------------------------------------

** Can I customize the way things look in Alien Blue HD? **

You certainly can.  Alien Blue HD defaults to a Minimalist layout in comments (similar to the Reddit website.)  You can also switch to Boxed comments (or Classic) via:

Settings -&gt; Comment Settings -&gt; Comments Display Style

**Note:** I highly recommend that you enable ""Show Domain On Post List"" in the preferences section (apologies, this should have been enabled by default).

----------------------------------------------------

** Why isn't this a universal app? **

There are two reasons:

1. I don't want to affect the donation-ware model of Alien Blue on the iPhone

2. I'm already shit-scared when I'm releasing updates for a single device.  With approx 2 weeks in review for each critical update, I'm in a perpetual state of stress thinking that I may be releasing another bug that I can do absolutely nothing about for two weeks after approval.  With two separate versions, I can at least focus on one release at a time.

----------------------------------------------------

** How much work did it take to get here? **

You can see the [changelog](http://alienblue.org/beta/changelog-hd.txt) for the launch version.

----------------------------------------------------

** Why isn't it free? **

Here's what I wrote in another thread prior to the launch of ABHD:

&gt; I'm making this one a paid app, so that I can keep up the time and resources to continue development. Only about 2-5% of users upgrade Alien Blue to Pro (equates to about $50-$70 per week) and I put in about 40-50 hours each week to it's development in addition to my existing contracts. I'm hoping that ABHD will at least give me a bit of breathing room, so that I can reduce my contract work load.

&gt; The free version of the app is purposefully unrestrictive so that people contribute only if they like the app, not because they have to.  Alternatives were to include advertising within the apps, but this is not a road I want to head down. Even with the 95+% free user base, I don't want to reduce their enjoyment of the app via mobile ads.

----------------------------------------------------

** Is there an update already on the way? **

You bet your ass!

If you like the app, please be sure to leave a review on the App Store.  These definitely help with approvals.",128,200,2010-09-14,AAPL,0.03956208378076553,0.923623263835907,0.0368146188557148

- auto-correct: irritating enough for me to turn off after having given it an extended trial period
- keyboard: after a month, I'm still not used to typing on it and end up punching other letters
- compatibility: I don't want to start a flamewar on this but not having flash really sucks sometimes. Some people have argued that flash is low-performance, high-consumption. But come on, the iPad is powerful enough to show HD videos and run Unreal Engine, then it should as well play flash videos and games...
- too addictive: When I have people over, everybody just keeps playing with the iPad. Nobody talks, it's just turns on the iPad. Forever alone...
- When playing multiplayer boardgames, it is as if buttons can only be pressed from certain angles. ie, a player on one side of the ipad, from their point of view, presses a button but it systematically does not register. Then somebody else on the other side of the board does, and boom... it registers every time. It has, I believe, something to do with perspective.

This app also served as an objective-c primer for myself and now that it has been some time, I find myself wildly embarrassed by my code :P


[Sonice](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonice/id390967109?mt=8) is my second application that was just approved earlier today. I used this project as a study on Apple's Cocoa Touch api and adhering to their user interface guidelines. Sonice is a universal binary and thusly has a native iPhone and iPad implementation.


Both of these applications are currently free. Though it might take the app store a little bit of time to process my change for Starflash (it used to be $.99).

My only other idea is to take it to work and secretly swap it with one of the Intel ones and wait for all the ""why is this computer so slow?"" complaints.

apple,"I may just be an idiot, but...","I (like many of you I assume) use Gmail quite a bit, usually in Safari.  I find it very frustrating that in the email and chat windows it will detect misspelled words, but I can't find any way to right click on them for suggestions like in every other text field on a website.  I'm sure this is a byproduct of how the page is written, but does anyone know to use this functionality in gmail windows?

Thanks!

tl;dr: How do you right-click correct spelling in Gmail on Safari?

**EDIT**: retlawmacpro seems to have found a solution.  The word must be highlighted individually for the spelling suggestions to appear.  It seems in Gmail because of the window structure this doesn't always happen on a single right click, so double click to highlight the word (or manually highlight it) and then right click.",26,9,2010-09-18,AAPL,0.04160940274596214,0.9289698600769043,0.02942078374326229

mac,Looking for a free Dreamweaver alternative.,"I've recently bought a Mac, and I can't seem to find alternative to what I used for php development on a PC... dreamweaver.

I don't use the WYSIWYG function at all.  Pretty much all I need is a php editor that has slick ftp functionality built in.  Unless I'm doing it wrong, none of the mac editors that I've used have allowed me to pick a destination server, then just hit an upload button to send up and updated file.

Code highlighting is my only other requirement.  I don't develop full time and not that much on a mac, so paying $99 for an expensive program is probably not in it for me.

EDIT:  Thanks everyone for your great suggestions, upboats all around.  I'm going to use this as my masterlist to start with.  I think what I might do is use textwrangler and cyberduck to get immediately started, and then start learning aptana/zend/eclipse as a long term solution.

apple,What Ping should have Been,"Ping seems to have focused on the wrong idea. Right now Ping is centered around the artists and, honestly I couldn't give a crap about the artists. If I wanted info on an artist, I could just follow them on Twitter or Facebook. They both do that job very well.

What neither do well and what Ping should have been centered around is the idea of #nowplaying. Most important to me is discovering songs my friends love. People tweet now playing because you find a new song you think others might like or an old song that fits your mood of the day and you want to share that mood. Now playing gets lost in a stream of other randomness on Facebook and Twitter, but if it had its own feed where I could find the friends that I already have on Facebook and Twitter it would be very useful to me. I would be inspired to download songs I don‚Äôt have yet or add songs I hadn‚Äôt been listening to to my ipod. I should be able to Shazam a song and send it straight to ping with a comment.

Ping should be smart enough to let me see the songs pinged sorted by genre, artist, whether or not I already have it, how many times my friends pinged a song which hints at popularity, if I‚Äôve never heard the song before. People should be able to ping a whole playlist if they want to. Podcasts, tv shows, and movies should get the same treatment. The potential for this is pretty big. Sadly, its being wasted. I understand they put time into trying to partner with Facebook, but Twitter might have made a better partner to begin with since it is where now playing was born.

- edit

Alternative A) Last.fm

Last.fm similar to what I'm describing. I hadn't been using scrobble until today, but is seems to make Last.fm grab the info on the what you play in iTunes. Its almost perfect.

As is, I love Last.fm but use iTunes mostly. I always saw Last as the other Pandora, but it notably better. 2 problems though. 
1) I'm not sure if Last is smart enough to make me aware of music that I've never heard before, but a friend has hearted.
2) Because it doesn't have Twitter or Facebook integration I have to find my friends one by one, which is annoying in 2010. 

Ideally, when you open Last.fm, there would be a station of friend hearted songs that you never listened to on Last.fm and a separate list comparing the friend hearted songs to the songs you hearted so that you could easily find what songs you should download after you heard them the first time. Thanks, UniversalAC

Alternative B) TweetDeck

It was also suggested to add a filter on TweetDeck for now playing. I could be wrong, but it won't show you only the now playings of just your friends. I don't care what 150 million twitter users are now playing. While I do follow people I don't really know because Twitter is more about shared ideas than relationships, the TweetDeck filters seem insufficient for this purpose. It was a good idea though.",76,82,2010-09-22,AAPL,0.08776545524597168,0.8852963447570801,0.02693823352456093

Hi everyone,

Following up from last week's [Alien Blue HD announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/ddw3u/alien_blue_hd_for_the_ipad_is_now_available_on/), I want to introduce the next major release of Alien Blue for the iPhone.


** Why is this a major release? **
----------------------

* A new icon
* A revised user interface
* Comment themes
* Lots of features

There's a lot of information that follows, so you may want to skim through:


** Some caveats **
----------------------

* iOS 4.2 has recently been seeded to developers, and I'm working on reducing any impact this will have on you prior to the iOS public release.

* 3 Critical memory leaks were plugged.  Although I've done my best to keep the app stable, fixing memory leaks can sometimes cause crashes.  So if the app does crash on you, **please let me know** so that I can investigate it.



** Comment Themes **
----------------------

Along with it's new user interface, Alien Blue now has three in-built comment skins:

1. Minimalist (looks like iReddit/Reddit.com)
2. Boxed (closer to Mobile Reddit)
3. Classic

On fresh installs, the app will now use the Minimalist/Reddit theme to make new users feel at home.  For existing installs, you can easily switch via:

** Settings -&gt; Comment Settings -&gt; Comment Display Skin **


** New Features **
----------------------

* Simplified &amp; More Native User Interface 
* Back / Forward in Web Browser
* Subscribe &amp; Unsubscribe from Reddits through Alien Blue
* **Orangered Envelope**
* Save to Reddit Option (directly from the browser)
* Save to Photos (directly from the browser)
* Added ""Always Use Instapaper Mobilizer"" under Advanced Settings
* Support for **voting arrows** when listing Posts
* Support for voting arrows when listing Comments
* High-Resolution switch to view comics / text heavy images (from the browser actions)
* Comment Themes
* ""Comments to Fetch"" setting, supports 200, 500 or 1,000 (Reddit Gold subscribers)
* Introduced ""News &amp; Updates"" section
* New Icon (thanks to Jedberg, KeyserSosa and Reddit's licensing department)


** Fixes and Improvements **
----------------------

* Critical : Low quality / blurry images showing in the browser view
* Critical : Fixed AB losing scroll position when low on memory
* Critical : Patched 3 heavy memory leaks (would cause the app to bloat, slow down and/or crash after a short time)
* Critical : Refreshes Reddit API authentication token when expired
* Critical : Show All Images occasionally caused a crash
* Fixed: Missing Subreddits bug (when subscribed to more than 50 subreddits)
* Fixed: Multiple links from messages were browsing to the first link.
* Fixed: Keyboard overlapping camera controls for Imgur uploads
* Fixed: ""Save Image"" activating when tapping ""Cancel"" on browser action sheet
* Fixed: In-App Email / Bug Reporting rotating in Upside-Down Portrait
* Fixed: Empty Subreddit title when restoring from state (3.x devices)
* Fixed: Truncation of author names in deeper threads
* Moved ""Dismiss"" button to the top of the screen when presenting connection errors (as keyboard could occasionally cover it)
* Rounded corners of Subreddit logos
* Full-screen now available in Reddit Selector
* Added a Help button (top left in Settings)
* Improved differentiation of visited links in night-mode
* Fixed ultra-thin ""Hide"" glyph for Retina displays
* Photo &amp; Camera controls now hide in Landscape (as these are only supported in Portrait)
* Reduced opacity of full-screen back and exit icons
* Removed circular links to self posts
* Network activity indicator in the Status Bar now shows connection activity
* Improved handling of connection errors
* Improved ""Save State"" for 3.x devices

Check it out, and please keep me posted with any bugs that you come across.  I love to squish 'dem bugs.



** Next Update (v2.1 - Coming Very Soon) ** : 
----------------------

Mark-down (bold, italic, inline links and improved comment formatting)
----------------------

I've just finished writing up a lightweight [markdown engine](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/dg6nk/alien_blue_markup_support_is_in_development/) for CoreText (so that Reddit comments can be rendered very quickly on your device).

This means:

* Inline links (with optional footnoted buttons if you like those)
* Indented and correctly formatted quotes
* Support for Bold and Italic

For those with fat fingers, don't worry: the inline links are very forgiving and Alien Blue will check areas surrounding your touch to see if a link is in the vicinity.  I will be submitting v2.1 for approval very shortly, and mark-down support will be included.

Maybe it can even show me some cool pictures from flickr, but just having the time, a gmail checker, and my next appointment from ical would be nice. Is there an app like this?

*Update:*  I don't necessarily want it to be on the lock screen.  I would just like an app that behaves like any other app that I can keep running with some relevant info (clock, email notifications, weather, etc).  I'll take a look at ""Nightstand"" which seems to be most similar to what I want.

iphone,"Ask /r/iPhone: Would you ever pay for a free app after you use it, if it let you choose your own price?","So a while ago I asked for game ideas here (http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/d8sqi/riphone_ive_been_working_on_serious_iphone_apps/).  It's been more than two weeks, but I'm finally getting close to finishing - hoping to submit to Apple by the end of this week.

The game is obviously pretty simple and low-budget.  Although I'm really really happy with it, trying to charge for it would likely doom it to obscurity.

I was thinking of adding a button to let you ""Buy our eternal gratitude"", which would be an in-app purchase that doesn't unlock any hidden content, just a thank you screen from the developers (I would make it extremely clear what it does, I don't want to trick anyone).  The price would be your choice - $1, $2, $3, etc., or you can of course simply pay nothing and enjoy the free game.  It'd be non-obtrusive, just an option on the home screen.

If you saw something like that in a free game that you enjoyed playing, would you ever use it?  What would make you consider paying/not paying?

EDIT: thanks for the awesome feedback, everyone.  A lot of good points.  I know a lot of people don't like paying for apps (hell, I don't), and I know the game has to be good (I love my game, but I have no illusions that it's an A+++ title).

iphone,Anyone wants to test facetime? I promise views of unaware office girls and a totally messed up rack of cables.,"Just got a new ipod touch, you can call me on facetime at seele97@hotmail.com.

EDIT: Well calls have simmered down a bit, so I'll leave this thread with an open invitation to anyone else that wants to test Facetime. This ipod can usually be found active from Tuesday-Saturdays 8am-5pm UTC‚Äì4 (West coast time more or less).

EDIT oct 01: There were a bunch of missed calls from last night after I got home, I apologize for not taking any them. This thread explicitly promised unaware office girls and a disorderly IT cabinet. Not some fat man in his undies browsing reddit. If for some reason I do pick up the call and provide you with visuals of a fatman in his undies I apologize. It was not my intention to deceive you in any way, it was most likely the effects of Budweiser at 11:00pm.

EDIT: going though the missed called log from last night and cross referencing the area codes: Australia, Louisiana and Ontario.",35,56,2010-09-30,AAPL,0.05051734670996666,0.9214507937431335,0.028031889349222183
iphone,You wanted Reader Mode for iPhone and iPad. And I just made it! (20 promo codes inside),"I just wanted to share my last application with you and, as usual, give you some promo codes.

Reader Mode is basically the same as the Reader mode in Apple's Safari, but adapted for iPhone and iPad and offering some additional features like:

- Extracts the relevant information from any web page, including text, images and videos, and shows it to you in a format which is truly comfortable to read
- Merges multi-page articles into one single page
- Supports 5 different color themes: white, dark, brown, cream and sepia
- Allows you to adjust the font size and choose the font you like more between the ones available in your device
- Caches printed articles, so that you can read them offline
- Fully supports iPad and Retina Display
- Completely accessible (some accessibility related features require iOS greater or equal than 4.0)

I'd recommend you to check the screenshots from the **[iTunes page](http://itunes.apple.com/app/reader-mode/id393750561?mt=8)**, since that will get you a better idea about how it looks like.

Also, if you like the app, please don't forget to leave a review.

**Please, don't forget to leave a comment when you use a code, so other redittors coming after you won't need to check them all**
