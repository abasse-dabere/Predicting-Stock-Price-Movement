apple,iTunes 12.2 (Music) vs Spotify Interface,"I've been using Spotify since as far back as I can remember, but I wanted to give Apple Music a shot. Dear God, iTunes is a disaster for me so far. I'm hoping I'm just stupid and people can chime in... 

- On Spotify I have my playlists on the side, always there. If I want to add a song to a playlist, I just drag and drop. Done. On iTunes if I see a song I searched for to add it to a playlist I need to click the ..., then click on Add to my music. Then, once again, click on the ... then add to playlist then finally put it in the playlist I want. Is there just a way to drag and drop I'm missing? 

- How the fuck do I just browse streamable music? The iTunes store is just stuff I can buy but it's very ""browsable"". It seems all the Apple Music streamable stuff is under new. Great, but Apple doesn't want to let me browse. They want to push their curated content really hard in there. I loved Spotify for letting me ""get lost"" browsing. I want the iTunes store like experience with streamable music. 

- There seems to be little to no social with your friends. On Spotify I can subscribe to a friend's or stranger's playlist and as he or she adds songs, that playlist gets updated. I like how Spotify syncs with my Facebook friends (optionally) so I can browse their profiles and see their public playlists. I see I can send playlists to friends but that's manual. Spotify let me search public playlist by title, but Apple only shows their curated playlists. How do I find my friends who use iTunes and subscribe to their playlist? 

- If I'm in a playlist or in ""my music"" I can't browse the artist by clicking on the name like I can Spotify. If I go to ""Browse Artist"" it only shows me artist songs in my playlist, not all the songs available. I have to exit my playlist and search for the artist. 

- Speaking of search, I better remember to search in ""Apple Music"" and not ""My Library"" which is a manual selection one or the other.

I'm a person who'd rather do all my heavy lifting via a desktop app such as keeping up with playlists, then just listen on mobile. Spotify hasn't been perfect, but so far the iTunes interface is just very hard to use.

mac,Upgrade mid-2011 iMac with SSD,"Hi,

I have a mid-2011 27"" iMac (12,2) and I am considering upgrading the internal hard drive to SSD.  It came from Apple with a 1TB SATA drive and a 256GB SSD as a secondary drive. (Apple receipt lists the spec as: HARD DRIVE 065-0310 1TB Serial ATA Drive+256GB SSD)

I was given a 1TB SATA SSD (Samsung 850 EVO) that I would like to use as a system drive, and then I would like to add a larger SATA 3.5"" drive (maybe 4-6TB) to use for media storage.

Can I just swap the two current drives with the new drives and then reinstall OS/etc.?  I know that I will need to enable TRIM on the SSD, and I've read online that there may be issues with the HD thermal sensor, but I don't fully understand this.

Is there anything else I should watch out for?

I've also seen several different kits for doing the upgrade yourself, and I'm interested in doing this.  I'm fairly savvy technically, and have a lot of experience building PCs.  Which company's kit is the best?  And a local shop offered to do the upgrade for $95.  Should I just do that instead of trying to do it myself?

**EDIT**: I have purchased this kit from Other World Computing:  http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/DIYIMACHDD11/.

This should enable me to replace the stock SATA drive at least, and I will try to replace the SSD at the same time.  I'm planning on doing this in a week or so, and will update with more info once done.

mac,"Choosing a Mac (Macbook, Macbook Pro 13"", 15"")","Hi all,

I'm new to this forum, and I hope this is the right place for this question.  I'm in the market for a new laptop.  Since I'm thinking of getting more seriously into programming, it probably makes sense to go for a Mac.  After some research, I've narrowed the options down to:

(A) Macbook 12"" (1.1GHz Dual-Core Intel Core M, 8 GB, 256 GB, 2 lbs): $1290

(B) Pro 13"" (2.7GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, 16 GB, 128 GB, 3.5 lbs): $1230

(C) Pro 13"" (2.7GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, 16 GB, 256 GB, 3.5 lbs): $1400

(D) Pro 15"" (2.2GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, 16 GB, 256 GB, 4.5 lbs): $1820

(As far as I can tell, there are no real advantages to Macbook Air (13"") compared to these.  Prices are what I'd pay at B&amp;H photo, which is local to me, exclusive of sales taxes.  They throw in Parallels for free with each of these options.)

I've never owned any kind of Mac, so I don't really know what I'm talking about. I'd be using the computer for basic programming, possibly with big databases requiring some computing power and memory. Otherwise just the basics - word processing, internet, etc. No gaming.

iphone,Just downloaded new update. My few gripes about the new music app.,"I want to point out, I think it looks clean. The new music app looks fresh and slick and if the entire update had been solely a visual update, I would praise it. I have just a few issues, mainly inconveniences.

1. I don't know how many songs I have anymore. I love stats so I like to know my song count. Previously, I could check at the bottom of my entire song list, but that feature is no longer there. 

2. I don't care about the radio, or the connect feature. My bottom row used to be songs, albums, artists, and playlists. Things I cared about, but now I can't seem to customize it. Also, with the new drop down feature, it's far more annoying to access songs, artists, or albums separately.

Edit: There is also no quick shuffle feature. So far it seems I have to select a song, and then his the shuffle symbol at the bottom. 

Edit 2: When I'm on the Albums drop down, it doesn't sort my albums by alphabetical order. Just shows every album by every alphabetical ordered bands. This essentially just makes it an extended artists list. 

I suppose that's it, really. I'm sure I'll get used to it all over a week or two. It's just these changes feel mostly unnecessary to me.

This is quite common and consistent. Again, a few of the songs from one album may be grayed out and I can't listen to them from my library, but I can stream them if I search for it in Apple Music.

One example I have is in my library, ""Day 'n' Nite"" by Kid Cudi on the album Man on the Moon (Expanded Version) is grayed out in my library. However, I can stream it on Apple music. More interestingly, I can add the same song ""Day 'n' Nite"" from the album Man on the Moon (regular version) to my library and play it there. This is consistent through my MacBook and my iPhone, so it's not just one device being faulty, or not having downloaded the song, or whatever.

Note again, this happens to multiple songs on multiple albums. Sorry if this doesn't make much sense, it's hard to put into words. Hope somebody can help because I have no idea what is going on here.",10.0,8,2015-07-05,AAPL,0.025481833145022392,0.9312366843223572,0.04328153654932976
AppleWatch,Eking Out The Juice,"I just completed a test of options to max a charge cycle on my 42mm AWS. I tested three situations, each for a duration of exactly 8 hours:

1. Watch off wrist overnight on a bedside table next to my phone

2. Watch off wrist in airplane mode

3. Watch on wrist in power reserve mode

I took the watch charge level reading before and after each test. I assume the readings were reasonably accurate measurements of the available charge level.

Results?

1. 12% used

2. 6% used

3. 2% used!

So if I'm stuck somewhere without a charger I know that putting it into Power Reserve mode sure does maximise the available charge for times when I don't need the thing to do anything smart.",3.0,8,2015-07-05,AAPL,0.030016407370567322,0.9268792867660522,0.04310434311628342
ios,8.4 --- Lag after opening and closing Music app and when it plays next song in background?,"So I noticed some super lag (like really noticeable type) when I open the Music app after a while, maybe a second after it opens it is not usable. When I close the app (home button) and say, I hit the Messages app that is right beside it on  my home screen, it is non responsive for maybe a second as well. In addition, when I am say, texting or scrolling in Safari, I notice lag when the song ends and is transitioning to the next playing song. There is also lag when I get incoming texts while typing a message as the banner comes down in the Messages app but that's a different type of lag unrelated to 8.4/Music app because it was there in previous versions of iOS 8. Anyone else experience this or is it just my phone? In which case I should probably be a bit worried, lol...


**EDIT:** For a better understanding, on the main screen, there is recently added. They have the play symbol on the bottom right corner. But when I open the app, they're absent and the screen is non-responsive for a second. It becomes responsive after the little spinning wheel beside my carrier name spins and the ""play"" symbols ""load"" on the screen. Also, I've turned off, via restrictions and music settings, both Apple Music and Connect as I thought it may be the two trying to sync or whatnot on initial opening, but even when they were both turned off, the lag is continuing with no signs of it being reduced. So I am unsure of what the problem is.

**EDIT 2:** Was in the car earlier this afternoon and my Music app froze on the lock screen while i was skipping songs and ""crashed"". I had to go in, unlock the phone, and then reopen the app and hit play (to which it didn't even continue where it crashed and had a new set of songs on my shuffle list). Sigh...

Scroll to the bottom of the track list, and click on ""show complete album"". This is meant to complete an album where you may only have a few of the tracks from it, however, if you have multiple tracks, it hide all the duplicates, allowing you to listen to the album without having to skip them.

AppleWatch,"[PSA] Apple will downgrade your Watch from 2.0 back to 1.0.1. You just can't ""ask"" them to do so.","I, like many others, wanted to be on the bleeding edge of the watchOS updates and installed the beta for my watch and iPhone. As the iPhone beta got better the watch performance was still lagging behind...pun intended...I made a mistake downloading and I've learned my lesson. After hearing reports that its impossible to downgrade, I became antsy. The watchOS 2.0 isn't going to release until the fall. I can't have this on my watch until then. Even though the betas get better marginally, I use this thing heavily and its already slow as it is. 

Anyways. I called apple and chatted with apple a total of 2 times each. Everyone said that they would not and can not restore 1.0.1 on my watch and they recommended I reported the 2.0 bugs in the developer portal. 

Eventually, I took another route. I went to the support section on the website and created a trouble ticket for unresponsible and laggy buttons. I sent my watch in. They checked it and sent it back with a note saying that the issue was not able to be duplicated on site. I was furious...they didn't even call me to tell me what's going on. They just sent it back. Well I got my watch back today and it was back on 1.0.1. Really Apple? Why not say this is what was done. After some research I looked at the fine print and part of their diagnostic process is to install the latest firmware. So in fact they fixed my issue without knowing it.

TL;DR - Apple won't restore to 1.0.1 if you ask them to. They will restore to 1.0.1 if you have ""other"" issues as it may be apart of their diagnostic steps to install the latest firmware (1.0.1)",22.0,9,2015-07-06,AAPL,0.11248602718114853,0.8471404910087585,0.040373433381319046

apple,Cmd + number key no longer opens bookmarks in Safari on El Capitan DP3.

Now, with Cappy DP3, They've made it so that those command move you to the corresponding tab. Just like Firefox and Chrome.

I was about to go on a rant about how much I will miss this feature and how they must build in an option to changing it back. But then I had a thought...and it was correct.

Starting on Saturday, I'm starting to notice an AWFUL smell from one specific spot under my wrist, but only when I wear the Leather Loop band. If I put on the LL, after an hour or so, that one part of my wrist gets REALLY stinky. If I clean up and switch to the sport band, it's fine.

I'm a clean person who observes good hygiene practices.

Today I have worn the sport band all day and there's no smell.

Anyone else experience this?

 - How long can I expect it to be supported by software updates?

So I'm going travelling to India soon and I'm sitting on the fence regarding which phone I should get because I've recently lost mine.

I'm not going to lie I pirate all my movies, so my question is can I effectively put all my movies on the icloud and download them when im on the wifi or would it be a better idea to just get a phone with an sd card slot and put all the videos on there.


Sorry if I'm being a bit of a noob I would do more research myself but I've got to decide on which phone to buy before I fly on Monday

AppleWatch,My meta purchase experience,"So today was the day that Apple Pay launched in the UK.

Not that big a deal here given that we've been able to use contactless for several years now. However, there's a £20 (soon to be £30) transaction limit due to the lack of security with plain contactless cards. But what if there were shops that updated their terminals, just for Apple Pay, to take account of the added security and allow payments above £20?

It would have to be the Apple Store, of course.

Today I bought my Apple Watch, Space Grey Sport 38mm (I'm a guy, but very skinny, and it was recommended to me by both a friend and the Apple employee).... using Apple Pay on iPhone 6 on a contactless terminal in the store.

apple,My very long experience with AppleCare.,"* It all started with my 2011 15 inch MacBook Pro having problems starting up. So I gave Apple a call and they showed me how to do a NVRAM reset and that seemed to fix the issue.
 * Then about a month later my laptop would die and not turn back on at all no matter what I did and it would randomly choose to work when it wanted. So I drove it to the closet Apple store which happened to be Mishawaka, Indiana but it was two and a half hours away :( I get there on a day when it happens to be working and they run some tests on it and say its fine. I know its broke but they won’t do anything about it since they can’t find whats wrong. 
 * About two weeks later my MacBook completely dies so I drive up to the apple store again and now when they run the test they tell me it’s a logic board issue and that it will be $600 to get replaced. The genius was super nice and figured out a way to get me the flat rate repair option which was $300 by replacing my RAM with stock Apple RAM (I had upgraded the RAM myself from 4 GB to 8 GB).  So I went with that. 
* So after doing some research I found out that these Logic Board problems were not unique to me and my 15 inch MacBook Pro. So I wrote an email to Tim Cook about the situation. Later that day I got a call from Apple’s Executive relations department and they assured me that there was no widespread problem. 
* When I got my MacBook back they had replaced the logic board and battery which I though was a pretty good deal and it worked great for awhile. 
 *I got involved in the class action lawsuit against Apple and Apple eventually ended up settling by extending  coverage for the MacBook's. I got my money back that I paid so I was happy. 
*  Well after awhile I started to notice problems again with my MacBook and so I reported it and shipped my MacBook out for repairs. This time they replaced the logic board, top case, and hard drive. Everything worked well again after I received it back. 
*  Then about 3 months later it started acting up again and so I reported it and sent it out for repairs again. This time they replaced the RAM and the logic board. Again everything worked fine again when I got it. 
* This time though it only took a few weeks before I started noticing problems again. This time they instructed me to take into a Apple Store for additional testing. Luckily between all this Apple opened up a new retail store in Toledo, Ohio which is only a little over an hour away from me. I took the MacBook in and they said the test had to run over night so that’s was fine. 
*  I then got a call from Executive Relations which told me that it passed all the tests and that if something is wrong with it that it was my fault for putting some kind of software on their that wasn’t on the Mac App store. I knew this was bull because they had just replaced the hard drive and I had not even put my programs on there yet. So I told them to erase it and run the test again. Conveniently later that day Executive Relations called back and said they were know experiencing a new issue which was completely unrelated to what I was saying was happening and that they would replace my MacBook. 
 *They ended up replacing it with the new 2015 15 inch MacBook Pro with the new AMD graphics. Which is so fast compared to my old 2011 that it is blowing me away!! 
* Anyway in the end it took 2 emails to Tim Cook, 3 people from Executive Relations, 2 Senior CPU specialists, multiple geniuses, and 3 repairs. All in all I got a new MacBook out of it but gosh dang I had to go through a lot to get it!!",6.0,8,2015-07-17,AAPL,0.13053199648857117,0.8386388421058655,0.030829165130853653
iphone,Problems after upgrading to a 6.,"I recently upgraded to a 6 and also had a system update within a day or two after that. I've had nothing but problems since then and am heading into yet another Apple Store appointment tomorrow.

My apps keep randomly shutting down/freezing, the page moves halfway down the screen, Siri doesn't work consistently and the notification sounds keep resetting to the standard sounds. The phone also cycles off and on by itself.

Every time I go in, they pull up the error report, tell me my last software update was corrupt and then reinstall a clean copy. Would it be totally out of line for me to ask for a new phone at this point? I don't understand why this keeps happening and really don't want to have to go back again next week when it starts again. Nothing new has been downloaded since my last visit.

I welcome any suggestions or advice on what to do next.

apple,Apple impressed me completely today at my Genius appointment.,"I dropped my iPhone 6+ at least three times while at work. We have concrete floors and I bend down a lot. The plastic bit for the antennas at the top of my iPhone flaked off, there were tiny scratches and dents all over the casing, and there was a single hairline crack on the display. [Looks like this](http://jeffnitschke.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed.jpg). (Not my picture.) The phone was in poor condition because of my mistakes. 

Guy came out, looked at the phone, left and came back with a brand new one and charged me $0. I was absolutely stunned. 


He said that even though there were points of impact on the casing of the phone, the display showed none since none of the scratches were near the single fracture and that this was a defect. 



I did have AppleCare, so replacing the phone would have cost a lot less than a new phone, but $80 isn't easy to throw away. 




I'm just so happy~

AppleMusic,"UK users having issues with Apple Music: if you're on Sky Broadband, it's them and not you or Apple","I've been bitching about Apple Music not working for the last two days, but was confused by the lack of noise about it on here and elsewhere, apart from the widely reported issue with iCloud Library.

Symptoms are, broadly: try and make anything available offline and it'll error out. Try and play anything from an album or playlist and it'll just skip through every song. 

There's a [dirty fix here](http://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Fibre-broadband/Problems-using-Apple-For-You-service-with-Sky-Broadband/td-p/2354374), which works for me but is clearly _not_ a permanent solution. 

If you're in doubt this is down to Sky, in addition to the one above, have a look at these threads:

[Apple Music Now Wont Play Any Songs](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7117235?start=45&amp;tstart=0)

If you're a Sky Broadband user, complain to Sky. 

They've been aware of the problem since the 2nd of July. Sky are notoriously poor at fixing issues in a reasonable timeframe and since they make it very difficult to use your own kit effectively the best thing to do is complain via their [website](https://contactus.sky.com/uk/sky-broadband/problems-with-sky-broadband) or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skyhelpteam).

AppleWatch,A very Ive-ian thing about the Watch,"I was sitting in my office today and I found myself mindlessly twiddling with the digital crown. Its movement is just so well-tuned and satisfying, and I then remembered something from that Jony Ive biography I read a few months ago. Part of the book mentions that earlier in his career, in other design projects, Jony liked to toy with the idea of including a physical feature on a device just for the sake of mindless interaction, like a ball and clip on a pen he once designed. Doing so would make the device more personal, more like a 'companion' of sorts, to the user.

AppleWatch,Why I Love Digital Touch,"Digital Touch is primitive, empty in terms of features, and is probably one of the most gimmicky features of the Apple Watch.

I love it. I don’t know anybody else personally who has an Apple Watch except for my mother. She’s been loving her 38mm AW ML and today I finally sold myself on the fact that Digital Touch is one of the best features of the watch.

I’ve been trying to convince her to take some time out of her day to come down to the harbour front with me in Toronto Canada, to view some of the events going on for the Pan Am Games, enjoy the beautiful weather, and relax on a beach, she deserves some relaxing time. Instead of texting her, I decided to draw my request via Digital Touch.

A picture of the word “GO” (the train system), a picture of a train on a track going “choo choo” a picture of the skyline with the CN Tower, a picture of a ferry going across water, and a picture of two stick figures on a beach.

She told me that she hasn’t felt this way since I was 5 and would come up to her going “mommy look!” with a picture I had drawn in crayon, and she absolutely loved it.

She responded with a drawing that simply spelt “yes :)” she has away to go, but we’re not far off from drawing the starry night!

Any similar stories or uses of Digital Touch?",20.0,9,2015-07-20,AAPL,0.0236386489123106,0.9334208965301514,0.04294038563966751
AppleWatch,"So I've gone through several pairs of bluetooth headphones, searching for the perfect CHEAP set to use with the Apple Watch... and I believe I've finally found them!","I figured a lot of you have been searching for the perfect bluetooth headphones to pair with your Apple Watch. I've tried the following units over the years, and the introduction of the Apple Watch inspired me to look harder. I've tried:

* [**Motorola S305**](http://amzn.com/B002BH3I9U) - These died on me pretty quickly after sweating too much

* [**Motorola S10-HD**](http://amzn.com/B004QWOSLK) - These were uncomfortable and created too much of a suction on my ears, to the point where they were somewhat painful

* [**Motorola S11-Felx HD**](http://amzn.com/B009M27MB2) - Similar issues with the S10, but the battery sucked on this model

* [**Soundpeats Qy7**](https://amzn.com/B00LP6CFEC) - These were the most promising and the first pair I bought after the Apple Watch, and based on feedback from Reddit, I bought them. They worked pretty well at first, but I found myself constantly adjusting them in my ear so they wouldn't fall out while running. But the bigger issue was the large wire on the back that bounced up and down while running. This created an annoying thud sound in the headphones every step I took. And for whatever reason, after experimenting with EVERY earpiece it came with, my left ear stayed put, but my right ear fell out constantly. The weight was just too much to keep comfortably in my ear.

And so that leads me to the latest discovery, thanks to a post on /r/applewatch a few days ago:

* [**Mpow Cheetah**](http://amzn.com/B00V7N3ZUG) - These, my friends, are the best I've ever bought. They're cheap, they're super comfortable, and because they sit on top of the ear, they're fully supported by your ears and a small amount of tension applied by the ""cord"" that goes around the back of the head. The sound quality is great, and I really think I've finally found the best cheap set available. I just can't say enough good things about it. And they're still $3 off with coupon code **6KLVT6Q6**.

I want to point out that I don't get referrals from any of these links... I'm just a guy who has been frustrated with bluetooth headphones on a budget for a very long time. And I thought I'd share my experiences with all of you.

* Pick a phrase from 3 random choices 
* Draw the phrase, get points for someone guessing it correctly. Person who guesses also gets points.
* Pass iPad to the next player

If you would be interested in testing the app please send me a mail and I can step you through the processes. In order to test you'll need a chromecast and an iphone or iPad with iOS 8+.

The wifi calling/Calls from other devices now is simply amazing, and I can see why Apple is winning in consumer satisfaction.

Your phone is not used while in a call on your tablet like iOS 8. Your iPad is making a normal phone call, and here is the only gripe I have. Why must we use the FaceTime app to dial regular phone numbers? This isn't user friendly, and normal users wouldn't think to use the FaceTime app to dial regular numbers.

Is there any way of setting it so all links to YT videos on Safari will go to the mobile site rather than open the app? I know you can copy and paste the URL and change the 'www' to an 'm' to force it to the mobile site, but it's just unnecessary hassle for something that should be much easier...

apple,"A CoreStorage Primer, A.K.A. ""Why you c̶a̶n̶n̶o̶t̶ could not partition your drive using Disk Utility"" (An /r/OSX Crosspost)","### Background

One of the most fundamental aspects of OS X, the filesystem, has started to age. HFS+ (""Mac OS Extended"") has been around since 1998 – before OS X even existed – and some people criticize Apple for not adopting a more modern format. The trouble is, HFS+ is so deeply ingrained in OS X that it would be quite difficult to make a proper transition.

In 10.7 ""Lion,"" OS X was given an additional layer for storing data. CoreStorage is a form of what is known as *logical volume management*. Essentially, while a filesystem is a format for storing files and folders within a volume, CoreStorage is an alternate way of storing these filesystems on physical devices. This additional layer allows OS X to continue using HFS+ in its regular operation, but allows for the addition of features that were previously absent. There are a few products from Apple which are based on CoreStorage:

* **FileVault 2.0**. OS X supports ""full disk"" encryption, and does so by storing an HFS+ filesystem in an encrypted CoreStorage volume.
* **Fusion Drives**. iMacs and Mac Pros can ship with two drives represented as a single drive, and do so via a CoreStorage group that spans both drives.
* **OS X Yosemite**. When installing Yosemite (or El Capitan), your boot volume will *always* be converted to a CoreStorage layout.

So, seeing as how CoreStorage appears to be the standard going forward, it's time we familiarize ourselves with it and its differences from the traditional partitioning approach of old.

### Under The Hood

On the surface, CoreStorage's presence is not obvious. This is made especially true given the fact that Disk Utility seems to deliberately hide it. Thus, to get a picture of what a CoreStorage layout looks like, we will turn to the `diskutil` command-line utility.

For this experiment, you may use an external drive that you don't mind erasing, **or** create a 1 GiB disk in RAM to serve as a pretend one:

    hdiutil attach -nomount ram://$[2048*1024]

First, determine the identifier for the drive you will be working with:

    diskutil list

For the purposes of this example, the drive I will be working with is identified as `disk1`, however yours may differ. To start off, let's erase this drive with a standard HFS+ volume:

    diskutil eraseDisk jhfs+ Untitled disk1
    diskutil list

This should now look pretty normal, with a single HFS+ partition:

    /dev/disk1
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.1 GB     disk1
       1:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                1.1 GB     disk1s1

So let's use this partition for a new CoreStorage ""logical volume group"":

    diskutil cs create TestGroup disk1s1

Our CoreStorage LVG now exists. This ""group"" designation refers to the fact that we may now create *any number of volumes within it*. Let's start with one that takes up half of the group's storage space:

    diskutil cs createVolume TestGroup jhfs+ TestVolume1 50%
    diskutil list

*Results:*

    /dev/disk1
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.1 GB     disk1
       1:          Apple_CoreStorage                         1.1 GB     disk1s1
    /dev/disk2
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:                  Apple_HFS TestVolume1            *360.7 MB   disk2
                                     Logical Volume on disk1s1
                                     5A7B22F5-377C-4D0E-9417-F841F39E75F1
                                     Unencrypted

We now have an entirely new disk device representing our volume. In the Finder, you will see that the device ""TestVolume1"" has been mounted. Simple enough? Let's add another volume to fill the remaining space in our group:

    diskutil cs createVolume TestGroup jhfs+ TestVolume2 100%
    diskutil list

*Results:*

    /dev/disk1
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.1 GB     disk1
       1:          Apple_CoreStorage                         1.1 GB     disk1s1
    /dev/disk2
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:                  Apple_HFS TestVolume1            *360.7 MB   disk2
                                     Logical Volume on disk1s1
                                     5A7B22F5-377C-4D0E-9417-F841F39E75F1
                                     Unencrypted
    /dev/disk3
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:                  Apple_HFS TestVolume2            *352.3 MB   disk3
                                     Logical Volume on disk1s1
                                     A82B05A3-527D-4D6A-8948-77A2FA9FBAB8
                                     Unencrypted

Notice how on our actual drive (`disk1`), we still only have a single partition (`disk1s1`). And yet, this single partition is now housing two volumes, thanks to our CoreStorage group.

Note: At this point, [Disk Utility has become totally lost as to what is going on](http://i.imgur.com/YvHSNVJ.png). More on that later.

Okay, now for something even more fun... Let's create a Fusion Drive. First, let's destroy the group we had been working with so we can use its partition:

    diskutil cs delete TestGroup

Next, we will need a second physical disk for the Fusion Drive. Again, this can be a USB drive, or another RAM disk:

    hdiutil attach -nomount ram://$[2048*1024]

For my example, the drive will be located at `disk2`, but again, yours may differ. We erase this with a standard partition layout as well:

    diskutil eraseDisk jhfs+ Untitled disk2

Now, we are set to create the new group using the partitions of both drives:

    diskutil cs create TestGroup disk1s1 disk2s1

With the new group in place, we may create a new volume just as we did before:

    diskutil cs createVolume TestGroup jhfs+ TestVolume 100%
    diskutil list

*Results:*

    /dev/disk1
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.1 GB     disk1
       1:          Apple_CoreStorage                         1.1 GB     disk1s1
    /dev/disk2
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.1 GB     disk2
       1:          Apple_CoreStorage                         1.1 GB     disk2s1
    /dev/disk3
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
       0:                  Apple_HFS TestVolume             *1.5 GB     disk3
                                     Logical Volume on disk1s1, disk2s1
                                     71C46E6E-C50A-4BD5-B2D6-42CFECB811BB
                                     Unencrypted

Voila. We now have a single volume which is based on our two physical partitions. Note how it utilizes a combination of the partitions' storage capacity! There is a small overhead of a few hundred megabytes, but this becomes insignificant when we're talking about drives with more reasonable capacity.

Interestingly, [Disk Utility now displays our two physical drives as a single drive housing our volume](http://i.imgur.com/Nw1OEeh.png).

To clean up, we may delete the CoreStorage group and eject the drives:

    diskutil cs delete TestGroup
    diskutil eject disk1
    diskutil eject disk2

### Disk Utility Hangups

Despite CoreStorage having been introduced in OS X 10.7, Disk Utility is the manjor sticking point in taking full advantage of its capabilities.

Up through Yosemite, Disk Utility has a notable lacking in its representation and manipulation of CoreStorage layouts. Not only does it not provide a clear picture of the partitions, groups, and volumes that make up these layouts, it is entirely unable to create or remove them. The only function Disk Utility in 10.10 can perform is reformatting logical volumes.

In 10.11 ""El Capitan,"" Disk Utility has been completely rewritten. In addition to reformatting logical volumes, this new version is capable of [simultaneously resizing a CoreStorage partition, the Group it backs, and a volume contained within that group](http://i.imgur.com/1bMy4AL.png) (this function is equivalent to `diskutil cs resizeStack`). However, the new Disk Utility is still [incapable of handling Groups that contain multiple logical volumes](http://i.imgur.com/g4qHFwE.png), or selectively resizing partitions, etcetera.

Since it would be well within technological feasibility for Apple to implement greater functionality, here's hoping they make the true power of CoreStorage more accessible sooner rather than later!

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I hope this writeup has been helpful. Of course, if you have any questions, or had run in to your own hangups at any point of this writeup, don't hesitate to bring it up in the comments. In any case, I hope this has shed some light on the current and future state of OS X's storage layers.

ipad,"I'd like an iPad, but I'm having trouble seeing what I could use it for.","Hello, /r/iPad. I've been considering getting an iPad, preferably the 2nd gen Mini. I have an iPhone 5s already so adapting to iOS is no issue. However, I have a laptop and I like it, but I'd like to know what the iPad can do and what makes it so special. I know it's much more portable than my laptop but I'd like to know, specifically, what I could do with it. Thanks.

apple,As a longtime Nexus user...would I like using an iPhone?,"I realize I am posting this in the apple subreddit but here it goes.. 

I have been a Google Nexus User for quite some time now, I have used many Nexus phones and others starting with the OG droid.  (Verizon's equivalent to the iPhone) 

I used to be all about root and custom recovery with a custom OS however those days are long and gone, I simply do not have the time to tinker with this thing anymore.  The only thing I use root for is to block ads or WiFi Tether.  

I like how smooth the Nexus 6 runs and Google's suite of apps which I have been using for years now.  It would be hard to give up my Gmail account just because I got a new phone.  

I've always liked the look and design of the iPhone especially its slim appearance.  iOS on the other hand worries me because I have never used it before.  My questions to you guys is what are some benefits of it and would it be a hard switch?

I have TMO Jump! So I could just wait until the new one comes out and get it right when it comes out.  Thanks!

Edit: wow you guys are great... I've never got this many replys before!  I sure have a lot to read on my lunch break and I really appreciate everyone's input.",141.0,85,2015-07-31,AAPL,0.020932534709572792,0.9140128493309021,0.06505461037158966
