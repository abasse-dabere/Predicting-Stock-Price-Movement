mac,New rMBP owner with 3 questions!,"Hey guys, I just picked up the new 2014 rMBP 13'' mid tier model a few hours ago. Decided to return the Surface Pro 3 and try out a Macbook! This is the first OS X based computer I have ever owned so I'm still trying to learn through playing around. I'm also not very tech savvy so keep that in mind lol.

I have a few questions I'm hoping someone can answer for me.

1. On my Surface Pro 3 when I right clicked on the Windows Desktop and went clicked Screen Resolution it would show that my current resolution was all the way at the top using the native 2160x1440 resolution and I could choose any of the resolutions below it. But on Mac when I go to System Preferences and then Display it shows my screen resolution as ""Best for Display"". So I went to http://www.whatismyscreenresolution.com and saw it was running 1280x800 and there isn't an option for 2560x1600. Can someone explain why it wouldn't be default running at 2560x1600 like how the SP3 ran at 2160x1440? I know there is a reason for it just hoping someone can make it clear for me.

2. Can someone explain how closing a program in OS X works? When I click the top left corner X I see that it doesn't close some programs like Safari because the little black dot on the dock under the Safari app indicates it's still running. So I need to go to the top bar and click Safari then Quit Safari to actually have the program fully closed? 

3. On using IE and Chrome on my SP3 I always turned on the setting to restore the last session upon opening the browsers so I could pick up where I left off. I enabled that setting in Safari&gt;Preferences&gt;Safari Opens with All windows from last session. I noticed that when just clicking the red X to 'exit' Safari and then reopening it later on my last session wouldn't be restored. It would just open up with the default homepage. However if I went to Safari&gt;Quit Safari instead clicking the top left red X, and reopened Safari later on my previous websites from the last session would all be there from the start. Is there a setting I so that I could have all the pages from my last session restored from clicking the red X button instead of having to go to Safari&gt;Quit Safari to make it work every time?",10.0,7,2014-08-01,AAPL,0.056018177419900894,0.9077295064926147,0.036252278834581375

apple,Two nice subtle UI ehnancement I've noticed in OSX Yosemite,"Both are little things that PC users complain that the mac doesn't do, that it now does.

1. Double clicking anywhere in the title bar (the whole grey section) to ""maximize"" – this is especially useful to know as the green button now triggers fullscreen not instead of zoom. (However option-clicking the green button preserves the old zoom).

2. Open/Save dialog now supports drag and dropping of files. I noticed this accidentally as I use the previous function all the time - dragging a folder and/or file into the open/save before yosemite used to navigate to that folder and/or file. In yosemite, dragging a folder will move or copy the folder. To use the previous drag-to-navigate, you need to drag the folder or file to the dropdown at the top of the Open/Save.

apple,"My brother was in Shenzhen, China and I had him buy me a knockoff iPhone 6","[Link to pictures](http://imgur.com/a/rZDuf)It really is a pretty impressive feat they managed in making this look very Apple like, from the box, lightning cable, to the phone.  It's running Android 4.4.2 though it is heavily skinned to look nearly identical to iOS(obviously).  I bet the average person wouldn't be able to tell it isn't an actual iPhone.

The home button is a little wonky and makes a pretty audible click, but other than that the build quality is pretty nice, though obviously not Apple quality.  You can see in the pictures when you click on the App Store it takes you to the Play Store, and most of the stock apps take you to a similar Android App.  Everything seemingly works on it and I think I might switch to it for awhile to impress people at the bar and convince them I got an early iPhone 6. :)

If you want to ask any questions I'm all ears.  The 4.7"" size seems perfect to me and it really does feel good in the hand if Apple really does have a similar size in mind.

mac,"Considering my first MacBook for iOS development, Air or Pro?","Like the title suggests, I am looking to get a MacBook for developing apps for iOS, I don't plan on rendering huge movies, or developing albums or becoming a super artist using Photoshop--I will be doing some LIGHT photo editing though (just for everyday pics that I will upload to facebook/instagram etc.)

The main use for the laptop will be: iOS SDK, Web Browing, E-Mail, YouTube, Netflix, Research, Writing, syncing iPhone/iTunes, and some other low intensity activities. I don't plan on doing any gaming on it, I have a custom built PC that snores when I play games at ultra settings for that.

A few questions to finish up:

1. I could be staring at this thing for HOURS at a time, will the glossy screen be a problem for eye strain?

2. First, some information... I currently have a 6GB DDR3 1033MHz Ram, Quad Core that is OC to 4.0GHz. I NEVER reach maximum usage except when rendering videos, which I do really do anymore, and even when gaming at ultra settings, my CPU/RAM/GPU never hit maximum, depending on the game CPU/GPU MIGHT hit 75%, but RAM rarely goes above 60% no matter what I am doing. 

With that in mind... I notice Apple products tend to have much lower spec Laptops; HOWEVER, I am aware they optimize their software to run on a very specific set of hardware which I know will yield better results. My question is, is the optimization enough to make up the difference in power that is lost, and is it enough to do what I have outlined as my primary usage for the device?

3. Brand New vs Refurbished. Pro's vs Cons?

4 I have very limited experience with a Mac, it fact it has been years since I last really used one. What are some of the benefits of a Mac vs Windows? If you are a Windows to Mac switcher, I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!

We're a small app-development start-up company founded in Taiwan and we'd like to introduce--as well as get some feedback on--a free app we've just released to the US. It's called iMusee+ and its App Store link is here:

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id892293290](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id892293290)

iMusee+ is a music app that allows you to listen to music and watch music videos provided by YouTube. YT music players are nothing new on the App Store, but we differ by bringing in aspects from Spotify and Songza, such as providing mood/scenario-based playlists that we curate ourselves.

Other features:

* International Top Chart rankings, updated in real-time
* A ""currently relevant"" playlist themed around things like recently released movies, trending pop culture, today's current events, etc. updated every week
* Background playback support
* Ability to create, back-up, and restore custom playlists
* Ability to import your playlists from YouTube
* HD/SD video quality toggling to save bandwidth/reduce lag
* Audio-only mode to save bandwidth/reduce lag
* It's free!

We're adding the function to see playlists made by other people (much like you can explore/follow friends and popular users on instagram) very soon.

Our Chinese version of the app has been pretty successful in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, but this is the first time we're setting our sights on an English-speaking (not to mention massive) market, so it's a bit of a new and intimidating undertaking. We'd love to hear any suggestions to help us improve our product into something people would want to use in the US.

I've been thinking quite a while about buying a retina macbook pro and now that they've released the updates I thought that it was a good time to finnaly buy one. I'm thinking about buying the base-model with 128 GB of memory, 8 GB ram and the 2,6 GHz processor. The question I have is if you think that there are any updates that are essential or that I should consider before closing the deal, I'd be glad for any answers!

I should also add that I plan to use the computer for browsing the web, watching movies and series and also writing documents and such for school, other than that just daily use, nothing special.

apple,I for one hope there's still a new 4-inch iPhone 6,"For all the hype about the new 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhone, it's almost starting to feel like there won't be a new 4"" model with updated processor?

I really hope Apple doesn't give in to the big-screen-lovers and totally abandon their current userbase. I'm sure plenty of current iPhone users would choose a bigger screen if given a choice, but I for one would still choose the current size, and frankly, I'm not sure I would be happy with a larger one at all. 

Probably about 75% of the time I use my phone it's while on the bus or while eating, so being able to use it comfortably one-handed is a very important feature to me, and even the current size is pushing the limits of that for me.

ipad,[iPad] Automatic full backup options?,"Hi gang

I work for an MSP that provides services - including cloudbackup for our customers. A particularly picky client insists on having us set up reliable, scheduled, *complete* backups of his home devices that are iPads and iPhones. His PCs and workstations I got covered, but our backup-software only covers parts of the files/settings on the iOS platform. 

For those of you that know of it - its Asigra Cloudbackup v12.2 and I cant manage to get that app to backup more than Contacts, Calendar, Photo/videos and reminders. 

But what about music? Other apps and their settings/files? This request apparently was spurred on by his son losing a lot of MineCraft savegames... *sigh* I know...

Im no Apple user so I turn to you guys; What are the favoured options here? 

Not iCloud please - the user has been severely burnt on that service before and is vehemently opposing it.

Not manual iTunes backup - the user is *insisting* that there must be some solution out there for the thousands of users that is in a similar situation. For 5-6-7 devices - manual docking and manual iTunes backup to local storage is right out.

ipad,I am heavy Microsoft / Windows user...,"... and I am looking for a Tablet. 

I completely adore Windows Phone 8 in comparison to Androids, simply because I want the phone to be USEFUL not OVERWHELMING. I don't need all the access to kernel and such and I hate in Android that after 6-10 months of using they become slower and slower and laggy. With WP - it's not a case, and I don't want to/ don't have the money to upgrade phone/tablet every 6 months or 12 months for that matter. 

Now I need a USEFUL tablet. That will allow me to browse the web anywhere in the world, so that I can book rooms on the fly or check my reddits and facebooks and... gmails. 

I've touched the Windows tablets and well they pretty much suck. Just because they don't have mobile Windows installed but the regular desktop thingy and when you're in the system everything it's just too small for a tablet. 

I've touched Androids... but the cheaper ones are laggy and slowly working (which pisses me of the most (!)) and the more expensive ones - they're kind of ok-ish, but they cost almost the same as an iPad and they're made of cheap plastic O.o 

I've touched and iPad and in terms of ""working"" it was clearly the best of them.

Now I really consider buying one, but one of the cheaper versions. Like Mini Retina + cellular. (Cellular is a must for me!). I would like to have it before 20th of November.

If so, when would be the best time for getting it? Will I be able at all to get older version from the retailer, after the new one is released?

* Western Digital My Book Live 3TB
* Arris DG860 cable modem/router combo thing from TWC (my only choice).
* Time Warner Cable - 30Mbps down, 5Mbps up

I have my Lenovo laptop connected to my TV via HDMI and the laptop is hardwired to the Arris.  I have a lot of movies and TV shows on the MyBookLive that I open on my Lenovo and watch on my TV (using VLC player for most everything).  For the most part this works pretty well, no real problems.  I was streaming videos straight from the MyBookLive to the TV, but software updates to the TV did something recently that won't let me stream anymore, have yet to figure it out.

Both MacBooks back up to the MyBookLive.

I work from home everyday (on the MacBook Pro) and while I don't have to access the MyBookLive very often, when I do it is brutally slow (I've done research and the speed I am getting is normal, it just seems brutal).  Just navigating through folders to find the file I'm looking for is rough.  This is why I have been contemplating switching to the Airport Time Capsule. 

I guess my real question is, will I see significant speed improvement when accessing the Airport Time Capsule compared to the MyBookLive, particularly when accessing from the MacBooks?  I am not very familiar with the whole 802.11ac technology, but I feel like that is where the difference would be.  How about overall internet speed from my TV (wireless, for Netflix mainly) and the Lenovo (wired)?  Any help would be great.  I've read a lot of reviews, but I have to think that the results will be unique to each persons situation based on their devices and setup.

apple,Any ideas why Apple replaced my battery for free?,"I have an out of warranty mid 2012 MBA (no Applecare either) that had a seemingly defective battery. The battery health was in the 70s after only 150 cycles and about 18 months. 

I went to the Genius Bar a couple of weeks ago and the GB tech confirmed this was very unusual and said there was something wrong. He also said it would cost $129 since I wasn't covered. I decided to hold off on getting it fixed to see if my CC company would cover it through an extended warranty. Long story short; they wouldn't.

Went back to the Apple Store today and the new tech confirmed again the battery was messed up, and I expected him to again say I would have to pay to have it fixed but to my surprise he said it was actually covered under ""Quality Program (E1)"" warranty. No idea why this covered it (I didn't ask), but I was sure as hell happy. Is this something commonly used by Apple or only in specific cases?

I read a lot of stories about Apple refusing to replace the batteries for free out of warranty unless the customer made a fuss about it. I certainly didn't so I was pleasantly surprised.",4.0,8,2014-08-09,AAPL,0.09061064571142197,0.867569625377655,0.041819725185632706

ipad,Video Player - Accessing files - Saving your place,"Since getting my iPad there's one thing that continues to bug me. I will sometimes download videos in different apps and what I'd like to do is to be able to access those files via my preferred video player and/or have the video player to save my spot in the video. I'm coming from Android where everything can access everything else at any time. What's the easiest solution to this?

For an example let's say I downloaded a video from YouTube using Amerigo, MxTube, Titan Player etc.

It's my experience that I cannot access that file from any other application - even a file explorer. Is this true? Is there a way to transfer it to another app or accessible location?

I have figured out how to export the video to the camera roll - but as far as I can tell I can't access even camera roll files via say VLC.

Is there another video player that could access camera roll videos? Is there a better way to get the videos into VLC (or other player)? And will VLC or another player save my place in video files - I don't know that it does this by default?

tldr I want a video player that saves my place because the default player does not. Also is there a way to get a video file from one app to another that I've missed? Thanks.",1.0,7,2014-08-09,AAPL,0.029320919886231422,0.9401808977127075,0.030498210340738297

mac,Max fan speed on rMBP and heat question,"I previously had a 2009 13"" MBP and I knew the fans on it ran from 2,000-6,200 RPM depending on the load. However, what is the RPM range of the new rMBPs?

The reason I ask this is because the fans on my old computer used to turn on every once in a while whereas the new computer hardly deviates from 2,000 RPM! For example, I opened up around 20 applications tonight with approximately 20 mildly Flash-intensive tabs, seen here:

http://imgur.com/mYaHqS7

As you can see, the picture shows 193ºF and the fans only running at 2,600 RPM. This worries me a little bit, especially since I can't find much (if any) information on the fan speed range on the rMBPs. I took the screenshot at 193ºF but I was able to hit 197ºF at its max.

ipad,Love the iPad / hate Safari on it,"Can anyone recommend an Android tablet just for web surfing?

I realized that I started to hate so many things Safari on iPad that maybe another tablet would start making sense.

For example, reddit on iPad became very frustrating. As I return from the article or comments to the front page it loses proper position so I need to scroll down on my own and find the topic in question.

Or writing a comment on reddit (or any other forum). Sometimes I need to provide a link, so I write the text, put brackets requred for links, go to another tab, copy something I want to cite or the web address itself, go back to my comment, but the tab reloads and my comment is lost.

In general, Safari became less stable in iOS7. My iPad 2 on iOS 4 was very stable, now Safari on retina mini and iOS 7.1 crashes all the time. And the keyboard - there are no arrow keys, manually editing the web address has become even harder than before as the address bar is a bit higher than it was on earlier versions.

On top of all that, I can't change my Agent ID so many web sites would recognize the iPad, offer me mobile/non zoomable versions of the page, tapatalk, special offers and promotions, iOS applications for their web sites or single girls in my city. I had enough of all that and for the week or so I started thinking about alternatives and all other options for tablets.

Unfortunately, I know absolutely nothing about Ipads and am finding out that there are different generations, retina displays, Mini vs. Regular, etc. She didn't specify which one she wanted and before I give away the surprise by asking her, I was wondering what advice /r/ipad had to give

She isn't particularly tech savvy or knowledgeable, so I imagine that I do not need to get her the most expensive/latest generation Ipad. I think she would probably prefer the regular Ipad rather than the Mini, but if enough of you think the Mini is better I could go with it.

I have a 2012 Macbook Pro and after looking around online I've learned I'm not the only one who hates its charger cord. Mine's somewhat functional but its to the point where I have to hold it in a particular position to get it to charge. 

I am looking around for a cheap replacement cord online (since Apple sells them for a whopping $80) and have come up with two options and wanted to get some opinions on them.

[This is the first option](http://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Charger-Macbook-13-Inch-MA538LL/dp/B00EEECKXS/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408386723&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=mac+charger). It is modeled after the old Macbook charger instead of a Macbook Pro, but in my experience with the Macbook I used to have, those things worked a lot better than the new ones.

[The other one](http://www.amazon.com/Factory-Premium-Adapter-Charger-MacBook/dp/B00KNPELKC/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=undefined&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=mac+charger) is modeled after the newer style. 

Both are in the same price point, and I at least believe they will both work with my laptop, I just wanted to see if any one had some insight on which would really be the better option.

I'm having a little trouble with my MacBook Pro 13"" (Late 2011) and am at a loss as what to do. Every now and then (at least three times a week) Safari 7.0.5 will freeze, which then results in the entire system locking up. 

Force Quit does nothing to help, and generally results in another frozen window on my screen. I originally attributed the problem to Flash (having heard from various friends that it caused their systems to lock up) which resulted in me removing it from my system. It seemed to solve the problem for a few days, but then it retuned exactly as it did before.

I have had this MacBook from new and have not installed any extensions to Safari, and have scanned multiple times with various virus scanners, which have all come back clean.

mac,Mac Server - Use Profile Manager to set client's list of available printers?,"Hello all,

I'm using a Mac Mini with the Server app to administer a small group of client Macs (roughly 40), and our space has access to two printers, ""Big Brother"" and ""Little Brother"" (they're both Brother printers and their size, well...you know. :D), the latter of which is used by a small subset of those 40 clients. Both of these printers are shared via the Mac server. 

Recently we had to send in BB for repairs, so we temporarily made LB available to all of our client Macs until it came back. Now that BB is up and running again, I'd like to enforce that only that small subset of clients can print to it. Before the BB needed repairs, our users didn't know to add LB to the list of printers, so until recently none of them had it installed in Printers &amp; Scanners. Now, they all do, and I'd like to enforce removing LB from their list of available printers.

Profile Manager seems like a good way to do this, but I've tried tinkering with the Printers settings for my own Mac and the results just seem very janky. I can still see my full printer list in Printers &amp; Scanners, and when printing from something like Safari (that uses OS X's built-in Print dialog), I can only select the printers I defined in Profile Manager. But when printing from something with its own Print dialog, like Chrome, I can still select the printers I'm not supposed to be able to print to, and can in fact print to them. Our browser of choice is Chrome, so this is a real problem.

**Long story short**: I'm trying to use Profile Manager to set the list of available printers to Macs it manages. Is there a ""right"" way to do this?

Thanks in advance! Your help is much appreciated.",0.0,8,2014-08-19,AAPL,0.04396779090166092,0.9261791110038757,0.0298530925065279

apple,Apple Maps icon analysis,"With Apple's frequent updates to Maps, it seems every month they introduce a new icon or two. (Bakery and Car Dealer being the most recent).

I put together this chart: http://i.imgur.com/AhmZjXo.png

A few observations of colours/groupings:

* icon colour has a metaphor to a physical place *e.g. a Park is green, an Aquarium is blue, a Cemetery is grey*
* icons form part of a collection that shares colours, *e.g. Transport are purple (Airport, Train, Subway), Car services are blue (Gas Station, Car Parking)*
* a single shade of yellow is very popular
* some icons don't translate well across cultures, *e.g. the Castle/Prison/Jail icon and the Military shield icons are significantly different from the designs you might find in European/South American countries*
* some icons aren't good metaphors, e.g. the Fast Food icon is a burger and drink, but it does't work well for a Pizza fast food place, *e.g. the Sports Stadium is clearly an American Sports stadium and doesn't work well for a basketball venue*
* often a hotel will have a Pub, Bar, Restaurant, Gym, Swimming Pool and Hotel in one place, often Maps will include the Hotel, but not the others, even when the services are available
* the newer the icon, the more detail it will have
* Japan has unique icons and a different style to most countries - many stores having their specific logos as the icons
* each icon has a clear structure, with a consistent balance between the white of the picture and the colour of the circle",15.0,74,2014-08-19,AAPL,0.018458284437656403,0.915535032749176,0.06600673496723175

mac,Mac server on local network keeps disappearing and reappearing,"Hello all,

I'm hoping anyone can help me figure out a really perplexing issue we've seen with a Mac server on our local ethernet network. What we're seeing lately is that the server (which we use for Time Machine backups) will seem to ""disappear"" and ""reappear"" to our Macs, with a different ""identity"" each time. What I mean by this is: After connecting to the server through Finder, it appears in the sidebar. However, some time later (usually no later than an hour), I'll get a notification from Time Machine that backups are failing because the backup disk is not available. 

Strangely though, if I go back to Finder and try to click the server link in the sidebar, I get a message saying the original item can't be found; but I can go to the ""Shared"" section, click ""All..."", and find it there. Sometimes I will need to toggle my wifi on and off before I'm able to connect again.

To get an idea of our infrastructure, we use a Cisco switch to input the internet connection, output it to ethernet jacks around our space, and also output to the office-server. We have 3 Airport devices connected to Ethernet jacks to create a roaming WiFi network, and our client Macs connect to these via WiFi.

mac,Should I use protection?,"I just got a 2014 rMBP after having an old school 17 inch macbook pro that was pretty banged up.

In essence we want to be able to have the PDF open and take outline style notes. I come from the Android world and I only know of Evernote. Evernote is awesome, but you can't open up the PDF in evernote.

We have access to iAnnotate, but it only lets us add notes to the document, we don't have the ability to edit it on the side. I'm kind of looking for something with two panels, like the Bacon Reader app.

Any recommendations?",7.0,8,2014-08-23,AAPL,0.022600913420319557,0.9370843172073364,0.04031480476260185
apple,My experience with an Apple authorized service provider,"I, like most people, expected it to be a sub-par experience, at least compared to what I would have gotten at an Apple corporate store. I had a 5S (obviously still in the 1 year warranty) that had a fairly inconsistent home button, and I didn't want to go a week without my phone, like I would if I had shipped it to apple. Also, the closest corporate store is about 2 hours away. So, I went to PeachMac (in Montgomery AL). After showing them the problem, they ran a diagnostic, and said they were required to do a software reset before repairing the hardware. After signing some papers, they wiped it, went to the back for a few minutes (presumable checking the inside of the phone) and came out with a brand new iPhone. they set it up for me and I was out of there with a new phone in under 45 minutes total. I also asked them if they operated any differently from an Apple store, and their response was that they run exactly the same, except PeachMac doesn't require an appointment. I highly recommend going to an AASP if it is closer to you than an apple store. 

EDIT: Obviously, this does not apply to all AASPs. However, this is a testament to the validity of them. Many people told me that I definitely shouldn't trust one and that I should just send it to Apple, but that clearly isn't true, at least not anymore. I do, however, encourage anyone who is far away from an Apple store to at least give an AASP. a try",5.0,7,2014-08-23,AAPL,0.04697711393237114,0.8919777870178223,0.06104504317045212

apple,September event predictions. What's yours?,"Some of us might wish for a spectacular event with with every dream product announced, but in reality, this won't be the case. Apple keeps spruiking about this years product pipeline being the best it's ever been, so something must be up their sleeves.

What are your predictions for the yet to be confirmed September event that have some possibility of happening?

Mine:

* iPhone's will no longer be named by numbers (iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 etc), and instead follow a similar path as did the iPad (iPad Air or 'The new iPad'). I'm thinking this because I don't see Apple calling next years iPhone the 'iPhone 6s'. The name doesn't roll off the tongue as comfortably as previous numbers, and kind of sounds like you're calling it the 'iPhone Success'. I rather see them calling the iPhone 6, or maybe next year's model instead, something along the lines of 'iPhone Air' and/or 'iPhone Pro' for the larger model. Nobody saw the 'iPad Air' name coming, so I'm inclined to think the same could happen for the iPhone.

* All iPad's will gain Touch ID functionality, amongst many other upgrades. The non-Retina iPad mini will be discontinued.

* The Mac Mini will finally return to the stage. New design, new hardware and a new price. I have a feeling the old image of it being the 'budget Mac' will be changed, and rather promoted as a close alternative to the iMac. I can also see it going the way of the Retina Macbook Pro, in terms of locking down and restricting upgradability after purchase. Apple will rather promote expandability as they did with the Mac Pro.

* As mentioned before, I think Apple has something up its sleeve none of us are expecting, and I'm not talking about the iWatch. I think some tweaks or updates are expected to happen to lesser promoted Apple products, such as the Magic Mouse or Wireless Keyboard. Perhaps Apple will finally adopt BluRay and implement it into the USB Superdrive? As with the Mac Pro, these may be announced, then manufacturing will begin. This could be why we haven't seen any leaks?

apple,Caution: My refurb'd iPhone 5 from Geek Squad contains third-party components; warranty void.,"TL;DR: Purchased iPhone 5 from Best Buy with the Geek Squad Protection plan; over a year later, made a claim and got a refurb'd iPhone 5; found out 8 months later (today) that the refurb contains inauthentic Apple components, rendering my warranty void, unable to participate in Battery or Sleep Button Replacement Programs.  

Here's the long version:

I purchased my iPhone 5 on release at Best Buy and purchased the Geek Squad protection with it.  After my battery life deteriorated significantly over the course of the first year, I made a claim on my geek squad protection and received a refurb'd device.  I then cancelled my geek squad protection.

I immediately noticed that on the refurb, the glass panels on the back were not flush with the main back of the phone; they were slightly elevated.  I didn't think much of it, and put the phone in its case.  Several months later, I hear a rattling sound coming from my phone.  I pull of the case to discover that the bottom glass piece on the rear of the device was detached.  Again, I thought little of it; I kept the phone in a case anyway, and planned to superglue the piece back on at some point.  

The battery life on my refurb'd device deteriorated even more quickly than my original device.  I was thrilled to find out that my phone qualified for the Battery Replacement Program, and I figured I would take advantage of the Sleep Button Replacement Program as well, since mine had just begun to act a little finicky.  

I made my appointment at my Apple store for this evening, went in, and the Apple rep began doing the diagnostic on my phone, in preparation for sending it out to be repaired.  One portion of the diagnostic requires the iPhone be plugged into a dock.  This is where the problems began.  My iPhone would not recognize the dock (I had never tried using one before).  The Apple rep took my phone in the back to a Genius to see if they could determine the problem.  They came back and said that the prongs that the dock uses are either damaged or non-existant in my phone.  

The Apple rep couldn't proceed through the diagnostic without connecting to the dock, so he discussed the situation with the store manager.  After examining my phone for a good five minutes, they noticed an oddity which I, myself, am embarrassed I never caught: [there is no serial number or FCC printing on the back of my refurb'd device. ](http://i.imgur.com/BLxmbeI.jpg).

In addition to the lack of printing on the back of my phone, he pointed out the faulty dock connection, the glass pieces not being flush with the body of the phone, and the fact that the bottom glass piece that fell off was held on with glue.  This all lead to the conclusion that the parts were not authentic and that my warranty was void.  

The Apple rep did spend a good half hour on the phone with the local Best Buy explaining the issue and seeing if they would resolve the problem for me, as there was nothing the Apple store could do.  The store manager at Best Buy told me to come down and they would see what they could do. 

Their only solution was to reactivate my geek squad protection (which normally is not allowed once it has been cancelled) at a rate of $9.99 per month, and exchange for another refurb'd phone.  There is no guarantee that this refurb will contain authentic parts, and there's no guarantee that it won't have the faulty battery/sleep button problems either.  

Although I'm less than satisfied with the resolution, I reluctantly agreed. I post this not as a complaint, but as a warning to others the headache that a refurb'd device can cause.  I can say for sure that I will not be using Geek Squad protection on a phone ever again; I am unaware if other places use third-party components in their refurbished devices as well or not.  If the use of third-party components in refurbished devices is common knowledge, then I should have done a little more research.  I haven't read the fine print in my geek squad agreement to see if this aspect is mentioned.  

I found it especially frustrating that, of course Apple refuses to service the device under warranty.  However, the representative at Best Buy pointed the finger at Apple, telling me that Apple has relaxed their policies re: refurbished devices, and allows them to use third-party components.  The consumer is stuck in the middle, with a void warranty.  



Edit:  [I posted about this to Geek Squad's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10104233007845163&amp;set=o.167050813322149&amp;type=1&amp;theater&amp;notif_t=photo_comment), and they responded that Geek Squad DOES use authentic parts, and IS an authorized Apple repair facility, and that any work they do on the device should not void my warranty with Apple.  Interesting.

iphone,"As a one man developer, I spent the last 8+ months at home and cafes coding and polishing the HECK out of my iPhone game. It’s finally out…","I worked on all aspects of this game completely by myself starting from scratch —teaching myself to code Objective-C, artwork, UI, user experience, and zero budget marketing.  A lot of it’s inspiration came from awesomely designed, clean games like Letterpress and the Dots series.

I’m not an artist, but I took the time to learn Photoshop.  I created all art assets for the game, UI art, the game icon, and App Store screenshots.  I would love to get your feedback on how you think it looks!

For user experience (UX), I really took the time to customize everything.  The transitions switching from view to view were all custom animations.  Even the swipe to delete on the match list is a custom animation.  Other things I worked on were custom animated menus, parallax scrolling on the new game button, and other probably unnoticeable things!  I really wanted to give this game a one of a kind experience whether or not you fully notice what exactly is going on — not just using the default UI/animations.

It’s a multiplayer social turn-based game, so I did all the game testing myself across my iPhone 5, iPad 2, girlfriend’s iPhone 4S, my 18 month old (today) daughter’s iPad mini, and my old iPhone 4 — the only reason why I didn’t sell my old iOS devices!

I could easily have released this game a couple months in from the start, but I really wanted to polish the heck out of it. For icing on the cake, there are other features I included like different colored themes, player and game statistics, previous moves history, game tips/strategy, and silly pre-populated chat messages. My game is called Reversus and it’s free.  I would love for you to try it and let me know what you think! I will keep you regularly updated on how the game is doing.

**TL;DR:** Self-taught iOS coder and graphics designer finally releases his iPhone game (free).

Not sure what to do, I'm out of almost $2000 dollars, and no computer. 
I don't think I can file a another chargeback if Apple or Fedex decides not to do anything, my bank will think I'm doing fraud or something. Anybody have anything like this happen to them?

Tag A Cat was built by myself over a 3 month period and was launched about 2 months ago. We currently have about 300 users and over 500 cat photos shared in the system. We have an iPhone version released and are waiting for Apple to approve the iPad version (any day now). 

I would love to have more people use the app and share their photos and Reddit seems like just the place. Feed back is always welcome since the app is still new I know we have a long way to go. Its impossible for me to have the quality of Instagram. But I will try to make the best Cat photo app I can.

Looking for some help. I have an old iphone backup that has some pictures of my grandfather on his last vacation with us before he passed. My phone crashed shortly after that trip and I was never able to restore from the back up because it says the back up is encrypted.

I never remember establishing an encryption password and have tried EVERY password variation I use to no success. I had added work email on my phone which is why I think it was encrypted and spoke with IT without much luck. 

Do any of you know a way to break the encryption for a backup? Would love to get those photos back.

iphone,All signs are pointing to the September Press Conference being a game changer for Apple,"It seems like in one day the hype train has jumped from ""I can't wait for the iPhone 6"" to ""Apple might be revolutionizing the entire company"". Let's look at today's announcements:

1) Apple is returning to the performance art hall where they unveiled the Mac for the first time in 30 years. There might be some symbolism in that, i.e. ""We're making a company changing announcement""

2) Analysts who are close friends with Apple/Tim Cook, such as Jim Dalrymple (the most trusted analyst reporting today) are tweeting things like ""holy shit guys, hold onto your hats"" and ""bring a change of pants"". Everyone in the know is acknowledging that some serious information is going to be dropped at this conference.

3) Apple has built a three story tall enclosure inside of which it has a construction project going on. It's near the presentation center and is absolutely *crawling* with security. No one has any idea what they're building inside.

apple,Monthly APPreciation Thread for September 2014,"Here's this month's App recommendation thread. What apps have you been enjoying for the past month?

***

**Guidelines**

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.
* One app per comment. Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS and OS X are both game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a sentence or two, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention Native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc), because everyone knows about them.

***
*NEW*: **Last month's top five suggestions:**

1. [**Overcast**](https://overcast.fm)-  is a brilliant podcast app. I particularly like the effects such as voice boost (normalizes volume across multiple speakers and makes them clearer) and skip silences (that speed up the podcast by a factor of 1.1x or more, depending on how slow the speaker is). It's free for the most part and you only pay to unlock unlimited use of features. - /u/rantrt

2. [**French Girls**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/french-girls/id607904602?mt=8). - People may already know about this one. A free iOS app in which you take a selfie and random people from around the world will draw you like one of their French Girls. You can also draw other people too. There are some amazing artists on the app that draw stunning pictures, there are also penis artists that draw stunning penises. It used to be anonymous but a recent update introduces username (obviously you can still remain anonymous if you wish). /u/ThisAverageGuy

3. **[Narwhal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8)** -  is a decent iOS 7 feeling reddit client. It does some cool things with the UI. It reminds me a bit of mailbox with interactions being mostly swipes. - /u/awkwardmotherfucker

4. **http://www.macbartender.com** - For power users or heavy menubar people - /u/bronzle

5. [**Countable**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/countable-congress-in-your/id893853823?mt=8) (iPhone/iPad) - Shows legislation that will soon be voted on and provides some information on it. You choose whether you support it or not, then gives you the option to email your representatives. I think this app does a few great things: (1) Makes it easy to see what legislation is coming up for vote and puts the information in laymen's terms. (2) Shows your representatives and their contact information. (3) Displays how your representatives voted on individual issues and how you voted in the app. This app may have been in last months thread, but they just updated it yesterday to add an email login option (was Facebook only).  - /u/Sky_Diner

Shoutout to /u/RebelNutt18 for commenting on all suggestions with links for all the apps, saving me the trouble of getting them myself
