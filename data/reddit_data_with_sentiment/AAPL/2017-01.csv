apple,"I spent my holiday break repairing and restoring a vintage Macintosh SE/30, and now it's talking to the Internet!","*So a quick preface: I'm much more of a ""hardware guy"" than ""software guy"" - there are probably folks who will read this who will face-palm at some of the roundabout steps / obstacles I dealt with here, but regardless, I had a blast and learned a lot.*

So I've had more nerd-time than usual lately, due to reduced holiday workload + taking it easy while a recent neck/spine injury heals. I've been [working to revive an old Mac SE/30](http://imgur.com/a/ZlEyv) I recently took ownership of from another local Mac collector. This one originally lived on the East Coast and was virtually destroyed in a trans-continental shipping mishap - the case was crushed and the internal SCSI hard drive came loose and flopped around, eventually shattering the ""neck"" of the internal CRT monitor. Not pretty. Fortunately, the motherboard, analog board and (best of all!) very rare/valuable Ethernet upgrade survived the damage as best I can tell. After migrating the surviving electronics into a non-smashed case and hooking them up to a non-smashed display, everything booted right up. 

The next phase of the project was to get that Ethernet card talking to the outside world, which was insanely difficult due to how hard it is to shuttle update files and network drivers from the Internet to a machine that effectively pre-dates the modern Internet by a decade or more. The crux of the problem was the the SE/30 came to me with MacOS 7.5.0 on the hard drive, but the closest thing to modern networking software emerged (in an embryonic state) with MacOS 7.5.3. 

The upgrade package to go from MacOS 7.5.0 to 7.5.3 originally came on 19(!) floppies, and while I could technically make those floppies with my ""Wallstreet"" PowerBook, it's a painfully tedious and miserably slow process - definitely not on my list of tolerable options. In short, I needed to get those upgrade files to the SE/30 by some sort of network transfer, but that's a ""chicken or egg"" type problem: how do you transfer files over a network when those files are effectively required to *enable* the network? Since I have an external CD-ROM drive connected to the SE/30 I tried just burning everything to CD, but modern Macs (like my iMac) stubbornly refuse to burn discs in the now-ancient ""HFS"" filesystem that the SE/30 reads, so that was a non-starter. I've also had no luck finding a local source for an old-style Mac serial cable, and while I have ordered one from an online vendor, I didn't want to waste all my holiday downtime waiting for it to arrive.

I’ve been fighting the Ethernet card all day with effectively zero success: I managed to shuttle the correct driver package from my iMac to my old ""Wallstreet"" PowerBook, and from there to the SE/30 via floppy… but it made no difference. I gave up trying to get it talking to my router or iMac (both devices are 25+ years newer than this SE/30 and just ignore its presence on the network entirely), and instead started trying to get it talking directly to the PowerBook using AppleTalk-over-Ethernet (aka EtherTalk), since moving the 19(!) disk images for the MacOS 7.5.3 update from the PowerBook to the SE/30 was agonizingly slow - definitely a good incentive to get some basic machine-to-machine communication going. Trying to get the old Ethernet hardware to play nice on my modern home network has been crazy-making - it just doesn't behave like any well-behaved piece of modern networking gear. For instance: the ancient first-gen Ethernet card in this SE/30 says ""hello"" to the network by blasting a ton of garbage / junk data at boot up, and just patiently waits for a ""WTF WAS THAT?!"" response from the router... a response that no router made after the early 1990's is likely to even provide. LOL. Good times!
 
Every time I got the software set properly, the PowerBook would throw up a vague / annoying error message (“An error occurred attempting to use ethernet”) and it would stall out. I started diving deep into Google’s newsgroup archives, and found a 20+ year old clue: the Ethernet chip that Apple used in some PowerBooks and Performa’s of that era would *only* allow AppleTalk to be enabled if they *first* received a “signal good, ready to transmit” signal from the other end of the cable… which the SE/30 was waiting for too. They sat there like two shy introverts on a blind date, both waiting for the other to start talking. Arhghggh. 
 
On a whim I connected them both to an old Linksys Ethernet switch I pulled from my junk bin… AND IT WORKED. From there it was a slow-but-straightforward process getting Mac OS 7.5.3 installed (and then 7.5.5, the final OS that will run on a stock SE/30). Once that was done, I was able to ditch the so-ancient-it's-basically-useless MacTCP software for the just-barely-new-enough-to-make-sense OpenTransport networking software, and sure enough, the Ethernet board fired right up and happily started pulling TCP/IP traffic (in this case, just a simple ""It Works!"" status page hosted on my iMac). I'm still trying to get DNS working correctly (I can load sites via direct IP entry pretty well, but any attempt to use a URL gets a DNS error), but just knowing the hardware is good means I've got all the time in the world to sort out the software and networking config.

I know a lot of folks probably won't be interested enough in this nerdy crap to read all the way through this, let alone attempt something like this themselves, but it's been a really fun and gratifying process, and I've learned a ton about the evolution of modern networking tech along the way. Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR:** Got an old Mac that was smashed, the guts were trashed, my brain got thrashed, but now it's working and I'm twerking 

**EDIT:** I should also give some major credit and props to the [68000 Macintosh Liberation Army](https://68kmla.org/forums/) forums - it's where I bought the SE/30 I've been working on, and where I received a steady stream of invaluable advice, info and difficult-to-find software for this old machine.

apple,I would love to see Tim Cook get fired up about the Mac,"There have been a number of articles published over the past few months about the lacklustre state of the Mac ecosystem, and just about every podcast I listen to which discusses these articles only seems to compound the impression I think many of us have that Apple is neglecting the Mac. The response to the latest MacBook Pros has been largely negative, the entire desktop lineup remained untouched in 2016, and Mac mini and Mac Pro have gone untouched for years, a lot of people are dissatisfied with iTunes, there has been an obvious shift away from pro users in general over the past several years... you get the idea.

A lot of people seem to be blaming Tim Cook either directly or indirectly for ""killing the old Apple"". A lot of things I have read lately, either in articles interviewing ""people familiar with the situation"" within Apple or just user comments on places like reddit, seem to depict Tim Cook as either not caring about the Mac or actively leading a charge to deconstruct it. And as best I can find, the only response Tim has really given towards this characterisation of him is the recent response about Mac desktops being on Apple's roadmap.

I would *really* love to see Cook get fired up in an interview about this. Not a carefully worded statement or a press release, I really wish he would defend himself and show some sort of *passion* towards the Mac to dispel these type of reports. People are outright accusing him of trying to kill the Mac -	shouldn't that make him angry? Shouldn't that provoke some kind of emotional reaction? I'm not saying he should necessarily 'attack' the people making these claims but I would really like to see Tim show a more human response instead of these canned, carefully scripted responses. Some sort of video interview with a journalist that doesn't give the impression he's reading a TelePrompTer.

I'm not against Tim Cook personally but his recent airy responses with little or no substance in their followup is really starting to concern and frustrate me when I think about the future of the Mac.",606,849,2017-01-02,AAPL,0.20941494405269623,0.7707890272140503,0.01979599893093109
apple,"Better Touch Tool has changed TouchBar from ""kinda interesting"" to ""completely necessary"" for me.","Better Touch Tool now allows you to create custom Touchbar shortcuts for every app you use.

For me, this has completely upgraded the TouchBar. I've started creating workflow shortcuts into every app I have, from Evernote to Office to my programming and design apps. If you want ideas for what to create shortcuts for, just do a quick google for it and you can find tons of stuff people have already created.


Some great links for things you can do with BTT. If you don't have it yet, I highly suggest you go and buy it, it's worth every penny.

Primarily use it for algorithms development and numerical analysis. A little more annoyed than satisfied at this point. 

Pics: http://imgur.com/a/c2k5g

**Good stuff**

The screen has made a marked improvement over the last generation. The rear hinge has also been replaced with a nice metal injection moulded part, which removes the last plastic surface that could be touched with the lid closed in the previous generation. Speakers are much better than the previous generation. The machine feels a tad faster than my 2012 machine, but not by much, especially on my CPU and memory bound workloads.

**Port layout and dongle life**

The new dongles don't affect me that much. Just a matter of purchasing a set of dongles for the office and home rig. What annoys me more is the retention force of the USB-C receptacle and the smooth exterior of the plug. It gets a little difficult to disconnect while gripping the plug on only the top and one side edge. Angling the computer to the side to try to get my hands around the top and bottom of the plug is also not possible, because of connections on both sides of the computer. I end up having to pull it out using the strain relief, which probably doesn't do well for the overall longevity of the dongles. 

A little annoyed that the USB-C standard does not permit DP++ in DP Alternate Mode, which means that my passive mDP-DVI adapters have to be replaced with active ones. 

Another annoyance is that the Apple USB-C HDMI dongle does not supply more than 60W of power, which I only found out when my machine started draining its battery while plugged in while running heavy computation. Also, only 4k30.

**Missing magsafe**

I still miss the magsafe, primarily because I don't have to worry about snapping the plug while using the computer in bed. With magsafe, I can drop the computer down onto the bed, knowing that the plug and receptacle will disconnect rather than getting bent if the computer hits the bed at an angle. No such luxury with the USB-C power cable. 

**Keyboard**

Keyboard isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I actually like the clickiness of the new keys. The small spacing and the light touch of the keys make it a little annoying, as I can no longer rest my fingers on the keys all the time. Thank god I get most of my work done from places with real, full-sized keyboards, so I have some time to get used to the sensitivity. 

**Touch bar**

I find it more gimmicky than useful. I wish they had just put it above the current set of function keys to augment them rather than replacing them outright. Having the function and escape keys be soft keys kinda slows my workflow when programming, but again, I do most of my work on a proper keyboard anyway.

**Trackpad**

The new oversized trackpad is probably my most hated part of the new computer. I've had palm rejection errors messing up my dragging and causing false right clicks. I'm probably going to try finding some insulating tape to reduce the trackpad to its original size to get around the issue. 

**Battery life**

Battery life seems to have taken a hit. The 2012-2015 had batteries sized just under the FAA Li-ion carry-on 100 Wh constraint. The smaller battery on this one, probably for the artificial weight and size limit, is regrettable from a design standpoint.

apple,Why is Google working so hard to deliberately cripple the Picture-in-Picture feature on iPads and macOS?,"If you have one of the newer iPads and haven't yet tried PiP, let me tell you, it's amazing. Not just for continuing to watch a video while browsing Reddit or reading books, but also super handy for watching guides and stuff while working in other apps. 

Combined with the side-by-side split view, it effectively lets you multitask 3 apps simultaneously.

Vimeo and many other playback apps supported it right away, and it used to be that you could use third-party apps and sites [like this one](http://ctrlq.org/youtube/pip/) to paste a YouTube video's ID into and enjoy it in PiP mode, now it works for some videos and not for others...

# So it was definitely working under the hood already, just deliberately disabled in YouTube's native UI.

Most YouTube videos also exposed PiP support when viewing in an iOS browser like Safari. **But now, they've changed their web player to cripple that workaround too.**

Just..why? [It's not even like it's hard to implement!](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/AdoptingMultitaskingOniPad/QuickStartForPictureInPicture.html)

For me this seriously cripples YouTube on iOS. I often used PiP for watching drawing/painting tutorials in a corner while keeping Procreate etc. as my main app, or watching play sessions of RPG groups while reading the game's rulebooks etc. It really improved the utility of both YouTube and my iPad. Split-view as an alternative wastes too much screen space.

----

**Even on macOS, you have to right/ctrl-click** ***twice*** on a YouTube player control, before it will show the browser's native menu for videos (which includes the PiP option). So again it's being buried on purpose by Google.

@Google: y u do dis? WHY the fuck are you not supporting these features on both of Apple's OSes? I can only think of the following reasons:

- PiP does not allow the embedding of advertisements.

- **Forcing** people to pay for YouTube Red because iOS/macOS features allow background viewing/listening for free. One of the recent changes to the mobile website player also disables background audio, **which until recently came for free through the browser's native fullscreen mode for videos.**  
⚠️ Apprently this ""dark pattern"" is also against the App Store's terms! You're not supposed to charge for features that users get with the OS for free!


- PiP on iOS makes Android look inferior? Though I don't know if YouTube natively (without any 3rd-party tools) supports any kind of global PiP on Android. If Google uncripples PiP on iOS in the future after they introduce it on Android, then this was definitely one of the reasons they're hiding it on iOS now.",399,1142,2017-01-04,AAPL,0.05298163369297981,0.920854926109314,0.02616349421441555

apple,iPhone games for people who can't think?,"Hello Reddit. My name is Ian and I have very very little energy. I'm 18, I race cars, I play chess, and I play card games. But now I can't do any of that anymore. I've been in bed for a extremely long time with no energy other than to use use the bathroom. I've hardly eaten at all over the past several days. I have no friends who will come over. I can't read books or watch movies because I won't know what's going on. I can't play the games I have on my phone because they all require you to think a lot or you need to be able to react, which I can't do. The only thing keeping me entertained is music. I want some kind of game that I can play . And no slot machines because that's not entertain me. I don't know what this sub is too well so I'm sorry if I break any rules I am trying my best. Also sorry if any spelling or grammar. I hope I can be back to normal soon.

------------------------

Edit: Thank you everyone for your concern. I will look into all of the games you've requested. I'm not sure what's wrong, maybe it is depression like most of you have said, could be some of the other things that were also mentioned. I've actually never been happy with myself all my life, I never really had friends and I hardly knew who I was. But it's not like I'm having suicidal thoughts or anything like that. Thank you all for your concern and I hope I get more active soon.

Update: Thank you all once again for rooting for me. I've been feeling much better since I posted this. Can confirm I'm going to a doctor tomorrow to get blood tested. I probably won't give any results here just because I kind of just want to keep it between my friends and family and it's not really relevant to Apple anyways.

apple,How AirDrop starts sending files before the other device accepts the file.,"I mentioned in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5m4rt0/airdrop_is_crazy_fast/dc122bl/) that AirDrop starts sending files before the receiving device accepts the transfer and I got down-voted for it.

It's weird because I thought that this was known for everyone. Every time I accepted a transfer using AirDrop I would already have received a chunk of the data. 

So I wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy and decided to test it again and I did a few times. I recorded a 1 minute video to show an example. You can watch it here: https://streamable.com/h83qn.

The file I'm sending is 748 MB, I made sure it was a big file so that I would have enough time before accepting the transfer. I start sending the file at around 0:08 in the video, and I accept it around 0:34. You can see that a huge chuck of the file already was delivered. If you wait long enough, you'll receive the file on the other device as soon as you hit accept.

You can test it yourself. I hope you learned something new reading this.

apple,Opinion on Tim Cook as CEO after 5 years,"I think I have finally formed an opinion on Tim Cook as CEO after 5 years on the helm at Apple.

I think one thing that is clear to everybody is that there will never be a time when Tim walks on stage to announce the new iPhone and someone in the crowd will yell “I love you Tim”
And that’s okay. People like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, are rare. And Tim’s tenure on the whole I think has been good. At least he’s nowhere near the Steve Ballmer/John Sculley fault line. Despite what many doomsayers are saying.

Tim Cook is a man of strong convictions. He’s resolute on the environment and has done a lot. He has also expanded Apple products in the Accessibility area and that is fantastic. He’s also really strong on User protection which is admirable and very important. He has also revived Apple’s charitable arm. On the whole I think he has done a lot of good things.

Now that I’ve exhausted all of them that I can think of, here are the spots where I think his leadership has been lacking. 


1. Apple product line has grown muddled.
This is the most important issue in my mind. We used to have 2 laptops nicely priced between portability and power. We had a light laptop with great battery that was more affordable and the more expensive less portable but more powerful variant.  We now have 3 different MacBook Pros, one surviving vestige of the Air line and one MacBook simple. The price differentiation seems to be based on what? Weight? 
Apple watch has also grown muddled, Series 1 and Series 2 and gen 0.  iPads are poised to get even more confused in March with iPad Pro, iPad Air and Mini and a new variant in an in-between size and of uncertain associations.  iPhones have also been growing in variants and all the rumors so far point in the direction of that continuing with the new generation by adding one more. 
Now there are good things about this undoubtedly. It all stems from Tim Cook’s background as Chief Operating Officer. Maximizing profits by giving more choice to consumers, re-using old components and manufacturing tools, keeping old lines and outdated internals. Many of these choice have undoubtedly been hard to pull off and some might even have been strokes of genius. But all this does is maximizing short term profits only.  
While in the long term it muddles Apples product line and introduces friction in purchasing that wasn’t there before. I’m also certain that if Tim didn’t exercise this type of magic on products Apple’s quarterly reports would’ve looked much more dire.

2. Vision.
I’m no sure if Apple really is lacking in vision for the future or is simply less able to communicate that vision to us than before. Whatever the case, I think it’s been a problem.  
The angst around the Mac, the slow update cycles, the lack of upgrades and keeping old hardware in “new” products has all build up to the point that many people are actively mad at Apple. If they were more honest, and more able to communicate their vision for the platform, for the Mac and the Mac Pro I think the severity of the negative reactions could’ve been mitigated. It’s the same with the headphone jack on iPhone. 
Courage was just a huge blunder that is going to be used as ammunition against them for years to come. Just very bad PR from Apple in recent years. I honestly don’t believe Apple coasts on momentum, but on the other hand I have little shown to disprove otherwise.


Cheers for reading and I’m also interested to hear what your opinion on Tim is overall after 5 years at Apple - good, bad, neutral?",284,279,2017-01-07,AAPL,0.03876030817627907,0.9209282398223877,0.04031151905655861

I'm contemplating using the iPhone as a daily driver, but I'd like to hear from people that were using Androids in the past. How was the switch like? Was there anything odd/quirky that you noticed?

Thanks!

EDIT: 
Thanks for all your replies! I went to mess around with my sister's iPhone, and I think that the notifications, default apps, and the UI (the back button omg) are deal breakers for me.

apple,Removing AirPods,"I know this subreddit is probably flooded with AirPods post. But I haven't seen anyone mentioned this. 

I was starting to find the AirPods a little tough to remove from the case due to the strong magnet and slippery plastic (Not a complaint! Love that the magnets are strong to keep them still). John Gruber mentioned this on his podcast, this tip that he gave that helped me found removing the AirPods much easier.

So what you do is to push the AirPods from the middle of the case, finger covering the light and push each of them out individually. They pop right out! He mentioned to just do this with one finger, but I found that quite risky and they might fly straight out with too much force. So I just pushed them out with my index finger and used my thumb as a support. Works like a charm!

After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.

iphone,Complete Guide to Flipping iphones from craigslist,"So if you are like me and like making extra cash and love iphones then this is the opportunity for you. I started this a few months ago and have learned A LOT. Im writing this post to show you how its done and what things you need to be careful of when doing this.  I am welcome to suggestions and will edit this if further information is found helpful.


**Step 1: Finding a phone**
Every single iphone has the opportunity to make money. Yes even broken ones cracked ones and icloud locked ones. With that said your best opportunity to make the most money is buying the previous generation which today is iphone 6s.


**Step 2: Checking the phone**
So you have found an iphone for a good deal and want to check it to make sure icloud if off phone is paid off and esn is clean(not blacklisted). The following steps are what you need to do.

* A. Ask the seller for the IMEI. If the seller does not want to provide this back away and do not purchase
* B. Check for icloud locks and find my iphone is off. This check can be done here:
	(https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/)
* C. Check ESN. This can be done here:
	(https://swappa.com/esn)
* D. Check if paid off/unlock. This varies from carrier to carrier but for ATT you can go here and enter in unlock request under “not an ATT customer”. This site will tell you if phone is paid off and eligible for unlock which you should 100% do because its free and makes you more money. Other carriers may or may not have a site like this but you can always call the cutomer service line and they will tell you if device is clean:
	(https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/#/)
* E. Warranty Coverage:
If you are buying a broken phone you can see if it is still covered. This is another reason buying last years model is a great idea.
	(https://checkcoverage.apple.com/)


**Step 3: Buying a phone**

* A. Always meet in public place. If you are buying a phone on the same carrier as your phone or is unlocked ask to meet at the ATT or Verizon store for extra assurance. Otherwise starbucks are everywhere

* B. Don’t haggle in person. All price haggling should be done before meetup to ease the transaction. Never haggle more than 33% off the posted price but that’s up to you. 

* C. Check the phone in person for any issues not covered in the listing. This could be physical damage or features like vibrate and camera. Check the imei to make sure it is the same and pop in your sim if it is your network. Make a sample call.



**Step 4: Selling a phone**

* A. icloud locked/bad esn. Generally you wont be able to sell these on craigslist for anymore than you bought them. I have had better luck selling these on ebay and you can make as much as a clean one would sell for IF you sell them overseas where esn are different and blacklist doesn’t affect their networks. If selling in US ebay mark it as for parts or not working and set up no returns in your account as well as block bidders outside USA. 

* B. Broken Phones. Generally you wont be able to sell these on craigslist for anymore than you bought them for. The hidden tool here though is the warranty mentioned before. If you bought the phone with clean ESN and icloud off simply go to apple store tell them what the issue is and they will fix it for either cheap or free. I brought them a cracked device which would not turn on and they replaced screen battery and motherboard FOR FREE. This was all on a 6s plus 64gb I bought for $80! Once fixed save all paperwork and list this in the ad to attract more money

* C. Clean phones. There are two main sites I would sell these on, swappa (which requires clean devices with zero damage) or craigslist. Swappa may get you more money but you have to ship and more room for scams. Craigslist is more straight forward but may be worth less money. Don’t sell clean phones on ebay. Phones are one of the top scammed items on ebay and I have had multiple buyers screw me over after buying a phone claiming lost or stolen or broken and ebay ALWAYS sides with buyer.

mac,Lucked out at the apple store. Still can't believe it.,"I had a 13 inch 2015 retina macbook pro that started giving me an awful noise towards the end of its warranty. The very base no frills, cheapest model

I took it to apple and they said ""ok. now its fixed."" Immediately the next day, same issue. Ok, this is good. Better for it to happen now than to happen after the warranty expired. Took it in, they tried to fix it again, went to pick it up, next day, same problem.

Now I'm getting a bit upset. I can only go after class when it's prime traffic time. I've been waiting 40+ minutes each way in traffic to get to the store. I head on to another apple store, and they guy says he might have figured it out. Says he needs to replace the fan. 

Great! 

Finally this ordeal will be over and I wont worry about it. Leave it, pick it up, take it home, am happy. No more weird clicky noise. 

I lift it off my desk sideways the next school morning and hear a thump. Uh oh. I shake the computer and hear rattling inside. Damn it. Something is loose inside. It never did this before. Time for another trip.

Once again, go to apple store, and they tell me the screen is what's making the noise. They're going to have to take it in and fix it. I make small talk about how many times I've had to come already and the guy looks at the history and is surprised at how much time I've spent going back and forth. 

He then tells me that he wants to replace my macbook for a 2016 equivalent. 

MAN! WOHOO! I'm dying of excitement inside! I'm ready then and there to embrace the dongle life! He just needs to run it by his manager for permission.

He tells me to wait, and comes out with the manager.

Then, bad news. There's no equivalent in stock. I die a bit inside.

BUT they can offer me the 13 inch touchbar 3.3ghz 16gb ram 500gb hd version since in this special situation, it's all that they have.

I was SHOCKED. This luck never happens to me. Hells yes I took it! I left the store with the biggest smile.

apple,"Seems like if we stop checking the battery on our Airpods, the battery drain on the case stops.","Not 100% sure about this yet but from the info that's been gathered over at MacRumors and my testing today, it appears that the case drain issue may be linked to opening the case and not removing the Airpods to use them. I tested this theory and after 24 hours from full charge, and using the Airpods for roughly 2/2.5 hours total, tonight my case is at 82%. 

Seems that when you open the case and do not remove the Airpods, they get turned on in some form which causes the case drain. IF YOU OPEN THE CASE...USE THE AIRPODS, DO NOT LEAVE THEM IN. This appears to be the trigger that starts this awful drain issue. The only way to stop it is to connect them to something and use them, then place them back in the case. Each time I went to use my Airpods using this theory, the Airpods were listed at 100% and it did not have the charging symbol next to them. If you see that sumbol, the Airpods will be on and will be draining the case. 

Please let me know if others see improvements using this theory. So far for me this has fixed my case drain. Curious to see if others notice an improvement as well. The positive of all this is that it appears to be a software issue as opposed to hardware, so we all can hopefully stop wondering if we have defective Airpods. Good luck everyone! 

Edit: now thinking about it more I probably got more like 3ish hours of use out of the Airpods. I charged them from about 60% last night and then once again from about 80% today. And that only put the case down to 82%. Going to see if I get any drain overnight tonight and will report back.",45,195,2017-01-12,AAPL,0.022197887301445007,0.9104727506637573,0.06732935458421707

AppleWatch,"An update on Spotty, a Spotify app for the Apple Watch","Thanks for all of the kind words and comments in the last post. It’s been a couple of weeks since my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/5lsn9r/i_spent_last_week_developing_a_spotify_app_that/) about Spotty, and I just wanted to give some updates on it.

## Website
Not really the app itself, but I spent an outrageous amount of time this weekend putting it together.

**Link: https://spotty.rocks**

## Real time complications
See the current track, its progress, and pause or resume it from the watch face. It’s especially useful if you make a dedicated Spotty modular watchface. **[[Pic]](http://imgur.com/4U6HzFv)**

## Low power playback
Last week was all about maximizing battery life. There’s now three different playback modes:

1. **Tethered:** your iPhone plays the audio and the watch acts as a remote. All-day battery life.
2. **Offline Low Power:** Spotty uses the system audio player and disables gestures. Up to 6.5h of battery life (same as Apple Music on the watch.)
3. **Offline Workout:** Spotty plays audio and **[automatically tracks workouts](http://imgur.com/VLyiWeh)**. Up to 3h of battery life.

This also means that Spotty now automatically detects when you disconnect or reconnect to your iPhone, and lets you seamlessly switch to a more appropriate playback mode.

## Spotty for Charity
Last time some of you wanted to donate, but I didn’t have anything set up. If you’re interested, I started a small fundraiser to raise money for the *Harmony Project*, a non-profit that supports music education for disadvantaged children in Los Angeles.

**Link: [Spotty for Charity](https://spotty.rocks/charity)**

## Closed beta
It’s happening (.gif). I think most things should be user-proof now, so I’m opening up limited closed beta testing. I want to be confident that everything is under control before going public, whether that be the actual launch or unrestricted testing. I’ll be giving everyone a days to fill out the form and add people if I still have room later in the week.

**Link: [Google Docs Form](https://spotty.rocks/closedbeta)**

## Release date
I’m still aiming to release Spotty for free at the end of this month, but I decided that putting early February as the “official” date provides a bit more breathing space if the testing uncovers a bunch of bugs.

That’s pretty much all for now, although I do want to acknowledge the mods of this sub for their enthusiasm and support over the past few weeks.

apple,Does Apple usually operate like this?,"I've always been on Android but recently I've switched to Apple. I tried it out to see if the switch made sense to me by buying a used iPhone 6 last year. While I totally enjoyed iOS and Apple products, I missed Android. Swithced to a 5X (that bootlooped and had a horrinle experience with LG, never got a replacement or repair.) Switched to a Note 5 shortly after and also had a horrible experience with Samsung (was sent a replacement device with burn in, 5 weeks to get a new replacement after that which also had worse burn in). Eventually got it replaced with a new Note 5 but it wasn't a good experience. 

Much as I love Android, under 2 years of updates and bad service from most OEMs just doesn't cut it. Decided to take the plunge back to Apple. I was planning on continuity so I decided to splurge on a Macbook, Apple Watch and iPhone. Being a student I'm only working part time and not a lot of pay, but I'd been saving up for a new laptop anywyas. Originally I was planning to buy used.
I first acquired a used iPhone 6S Plus from Craigslist. Seller either did not know or didn't mention there was damage inside the headphone jack, so my headphones always fell out.

Saw phone had warranty until Nov '17 so I walked in to an Apple Store and got an appointment at the Genius Bar. Phone was taken to the back, and the Genius came back with my phone and another box in hand. He explained how this was user damage and not covered, but they would make a one-time exception and handed me a brand new 6S Plus. For the waiting time (was told 30 min, it was 3 hours) he also gave me a free Apple Leather Case.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that 1) I can go to an Apple Store for repairs, 2) that Apple actually does stuff like this for their customers. I know you pay a premium for Apple products, but in my case I didn't even take my business to Apple, I got my phone used from Craigslist. Of course Apple wants to keep customers who are dropping hundreds on their laptops watches or phones, but it's the same with other companies' top products (Samsung) but those other companies don't do customer service like this.

Much better than having to send my phone off to Samsung and wait weeks. 

I was originally planning to buy my watch and Macbook used, but I do have just enough to get them new at the Apple Store and honestly I'd feel better taking my business directly to them after having a good experience with a product I didn't even purchase from them directly. 

I've heard Apple has good customer service but I never though there would be a huge difference between other companies and was pleasantly surprised.",126,329,2017-01-17,AAPL,0.14909502863883972,0.8095657825469971,0.04133915901184082

apple,It’s High Time We Have a Fireside Chat With Everyone,"##Hey /r/Apple,

This is a little out of character for us, but we felt it was time to be transparent with the community by filling you folks in on some concerns and upcoming trials. We've had a lot of internal frustrations lately, and now that Apple's major release season is over, we really wanted to have a discussion to get to the bottom of it.

The truth is, we (the mods) are tired. We’re tired of dealing with the trolls. We’re tired of dealing with the negative attitudes. We’re tired of dealing with the constant bickering, name-calling, childish behaviors, and incessant desire to complain about the same things over and over again. We’re watching this place slowly turn into something akin to the MacRumors forums, and that's something none of us want to see happen. We love this place, and we're very motivated to make sure it stays the #1 place to discuss Apple.

So without further ado, here are some issues we need to cover with you:

----

**The Elephant in the Room**  
There are a *lot* of negative attitudes in the subreddit. More than we've ever seen. The mod team is watching this place slowly devolve, and it's disheartening to say the least. Apple is a very polarizing company, and we should be able to both praise them and hold them to a high standard without turning on one another. We do understand Apple will get (and sometimes deserves) criticism. We just want it to be in a more constructive way so it isn’t just constant circlejerking, arguing, and complaining.

----

**We’re Motivated, but the Morale is Low**  
To be honest, we are getting exhausted by the work that the above elephant creates. Because of all the fighting, we’ve mostly taken a step back since it’s become a full-time job to deal with this problem. It’s harder than you might think because of all the unwritten rules we try to preserve – like leaving plenty of criticism because *we’re not* in the market of blindly defending Apple. But we're also not in the market of blindly attacking Apple. There's a balance that takes a lot of dedication to maintain.

Because we've been exhausted, response time by mods has been somewhat slow. So we want to sincerely apologize. We know it's been frustrating for some of you.

**But that changes today.** We’ve started disussing what needs to change around here in order to make /r/Apple enjoyable again. Here are some of the ideas which we’d like to trial:

----

**Trial 1: No Name-Calling**  
We want to do a trial of completely banishing name-calling and personal attacks in comments. Anyone who cannot keep it together and must resort to attacking someone’s character rather than their ideas will receive a 30-day ban. A second offense will result in a permanent ban without an opportunity to come back. Name-calling is childish, and it simply won't be tolerated here anymore.

----

**Trial 2: No Vapid Memes**  
We want to start removing comments with vapid memes and hivemind or copy/paste responses. The most recent example is one-/few-word replies with ""courage"" used like an argument. Another example is ""you're _____ it wrong"". They add nothing to the thread and just add work for us. We want to try removing them automatically to decrease workload.

----

**Trial 3: No More Beating the Dead Horse**  
This one is gonna be the most controversial, and that is why it’s a trial: we want to dramatically cut down on pointless negativity disguised as valid criticism. We feel strongly that comments shouldn’t devolve into echo chambers, and we want to cut off the head. That means we will remove the entire thread if that's what the conversation devolves into.

----

Please share what you think about these trials or if there is anything else you’d like us to try. We cannot promise a reply or a trial for everything, but we’ll read it all and take it into account.

We love you all, and we love this community. The whole reason we’re having this conversation is because we love this place. We just want to make sure everything we do is building towards our vision. And our vision is simple — **to have a place to discuss Apple passionately, both positively and negatively, in constructive ways.**

apple,Apple shutters reviews of LG Ultrafine 5K display in wake of technical issues,"A storm of negative reviews for the Apple endorsed LG Ultrafine 5K display have preceded the removal of ratings and reviews from the Apple web store.
Prior reviews have been overwhelmingly negative, and highlight specific issues such as routinely failing to wake from sleep. In many cases, attempts to fix the problem through physical reconnection of the monitor, or manual restarts, have caused the attached Mac to crash, become otherwise unresponsive, or develop problems with the touch bar (where equipped).
The choice of Thunderbolt for connectivity means that reports are limited to late 2016 MacBooks, with user complaints coming from owners of both 13"" and 15"" models.
Frustrated owners of the 5K model have now started voicing their complaints through the LG 4K model reviews on Apples site, while others have taken to social media.
As much as this sounds like it may be fixable through a MacOS update, Apples policy of silence (and now censorship) has only fuelled anger toward the brand. This draws into question Apples motivation for not backing the LG display with an Apple logo and a more Apple-like exterior design.


** UPDATE / CORRECTION **

26 Jan 2017 — Apple have just turned on the LG 5K display reviews. It also been revealed that they were never previously turned on. My assertion that Apple deliberately turned off the reviews was incorrect. The sleep/wake/crash problem with the LG 5K does still persist however, and MacOS update 10.12.3 has not resolved the issue.

I do not know why the reviews where disabled until now. Apple have yet to acknowledged the LG 5K sleep/wake crash issue.",380,1006,2017-01-20,AAPL,0.3439609110355377,0.631338357925415,0.02470073476433754
apple,All 3D / Force Touch features on iPhone,"I thought I'd make this thread since I still see a lot of new users of the 6S and beyond discovering 3D touch features that aren't really explicit unless you read the manual or watch reviews / overviews of the latest iPhones online. And its not nice to see people get called idiots because they don't know something about their phone, so hopefully this will rectify that.

These are mostly for the default apps, because I'm sure we all don't have the exact same apps. Please feel free to tell me any more I might have missed out or any errors I've made

I will add images alongside in case I'm not making sense (which I guarantee will happen as my fingers tire).

#Homescreen / Lockscreen

* 3D Touch onto icons on the home screen to activate contextual menus. 

&gt; [Force Touch on the Instagram icon and you will be presented with 5 options ranging from viewing recent activity to posting a new image or sending a direct message.](http://i.imgur.com/XHwv75t.png)

&gt; [Some apps do not have any contextual options yet and the only option given will be to share the app.](http://i.imgur.com/qniqKwg.png)

&gt; **Tip!**: When activating the contextual menu, you can select an option without lifting your finger by sliding onto the option you want **then** lifting your finger.


* Put pressure onto the left side of your iPhone until you feel a subtle tap and then slide to the right to switch to your previous app.

&gt; [**Tip!**: If you slide halfway, then it will open the app switcher instead! This is useful if you can't be arsed to reach for the home button.](http://imgur.com/a/6kUC7)

* When looking at notifications, you can 3D touch on a notification to open a menu which gives more options and allows you to preview the message.

&gt; [Additionally if you swipe down you can dismiss the notification](http://i.imgur.com/ycTWykH.png)

&gt; [E.G. Putting pressure onto a notification such as Twitter will allow you to preview the tweet then also retweet or like the post without entering the app.](http://i.imgur.com/a2cwnxm.png) 

* When looking at notifications you can clear all of them at once by putting pressure onto the **x** icon just above your most recent notification

&gt; [Example image](http://i.imgur.com/eKXQowD.png)

 * In the control centre, you can 3D touch all icons at the bottom (Flashlight, timer, calculator and camera), which will give you the options to:

- [Change flashlight intensity](http://i.imgur.com/sZYHJ4F.png)
- [Start a timer ranging from 1 minute to 1 hour](http://i.imgur.com/E1EF9hO.png)
- [Copy most recent calculator result to clipboard](http://i.imgur.com/yGKS3L8.png)
- [Take a photo, record slo-mo, record video or take a selfie.](http://i.imgur.com/QDqMaLs.png)


#Phone / Contacts app

* Putting pressure onto the Phone app icon will open a contextual menu which will allow you to

- View most recent voicemail
- Create or search for a contact
- View your most recent call
- Quickly call favourite contacts (favourites can be added within the phone app).

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/wYS07oQ.png?1)

* [In the favourites, recents, contacts and voicemail tabs, you can 3D touch a contact and then a contextual menu will open up allowing you to call, facetime, e-mail or text that person.](http://i.imgur.com/qwdsF8I.png)

&gt; **Tip**: [If you click the downwards facing arrow to the right, you can select a different number  or email to contact the person on.](http://i.imgur.com/mbqYLU9.png)



#iMessage

* You can instantly begin to record a voice note by holding onto the microphone icon and then tapping the stop icon

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/Uzhy5fq.png?1)

* When you have typed a message, you can 3D touch the blue send icon to send a message with various effects.

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/Jn3VW4o.png)
&gt; [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/9EqYkCh.png)

* Putting pressure onto the contact's icon that you are texting to, will open up a menu similar to that in the phone app which allows you call, facetime etc to that person without leaving the app.

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/OpHxj6M.png?1)

* Whilst in the message overview screen, you can 3D touch onto any message and preview the last few messages and if you press harder, you can go into the conversation. Additionally, you can also slide upwards whilst 3D touching and then you can quick reply with various replies like ""OK"" or ""No Problem"".

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/lLYFxy7.png)

* If someone sends you a weblink, you can preview it by putting pressure onto the link until you feel a subtle tap, then if you press harder you will open the link in safari, additionally if you swipe upwards instead of pressing harder, you can copy the link, add it to your reading list or open it.

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/I16xT9I.png)
&gt; [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/XBIq7OZ.png)

#Safari

* In the safari homepage, you can preview your favourites by putting pressure onto the icon of your chosen favourite link, then press harder to open the full page.

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/2k083oO.png)

&gt;**Tip**: This can also be done when on any other page to preview links!

* When viewing the tab switcher, if you place your finger lightly on a tab then press harder, you can preview the tab!

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/jIBmENZ.png)
&gt; [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/KxCx9Wn.png)

&gt; **Tip**: The speed at which you can preview the tab depends on how much pressure you are putting onto the tab. 

#Mail

*When reading mail, just like most apps, you can put pressure onto the e-mail to preview the email and then swiping upwards will give the option to:

- Reply to sender or to all if the email is a thread
- Forward
- Mark the message (flag, or move to rubbish)
-  Notify you if someone replies to the e-mail 
- Move the message to another location (e.g. from Inbox to Archive)

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/e3kRMQ7.png)

* Within an e-mail you can also preview links in the same way as safari by pressing onto a link or image till you feel a tap, then pressing harder if you wish to view the full page.
&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/OSSzQJI.png)
&gt; [Example 2 ](http://i.imgur.com/ZpODkML.png)

# Settings

* You can change the pressure required for 3D touch to activate if you go to:

Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; 3D Touch &gt; Adjust slider from light to firm (I prefer light).

[Step 1](http://i.imgur.com/dC7AN8g.png?1)
[Step 2](http://i.imgur.com/79kt35K.png)
[Step 3](http://i.imgur.com/TjIlahk.png)
[Step 4](http://i.imgur.com/TwYtSFt.png)

# Music

* You can 3D touch individual songs, playlists, artists or albums to open contextual menus which give you various options ranging from downloading the songs to your device for offline use, to adding it to a specific playlist or adding it to your current queue.

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/CRH2RuN.png)

# Reminders

* In the reminders app you can 3D touch a reminder to access a contextual menu which will allow you to ask your iPhone to remind you of this specific event depending on where you are or a certain day and time.

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/KRaLEFS.png)

#Photos

*In the photos app you can 3D touch images to preview them and if you slide upwards you can copy, share, favourite or delete them.

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/OTY349T.png)

#Calendar

* Whilst in the current month, you can 3D touch anywhere on the calendar to view events in the current day and also in the near future

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/1ikvRnk.png?1)

#Camera

* Putting pressure onto the bottom left corner whilst in the camera app until you feel a tap, will allow you to scrub between recent images saved to your camera roll! 

&gt; Make sure you've deleted your ~~nudes~~ private pictures before letting someone take a picture with your phone!

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/JBFGIXw.png)

#Misc / Stuff I missed out

* You can use the keyboard as a trackpad! To do this just 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard after the cursor blinks once and drag the cursor to your desired location. Additionally, you can push harder once more to select text whilst you drag the cursor and if you push a third time you can select paragraphs. Thanks /u/

&gt; [Example](https://imgur.com/a/Scxsw)

* 3D touching a folder with notifications will launch a menu that allows you to see which apps in the folder have notifications! (Thanks /u/Packerfan735)

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/3EdXCiB.png)


* 3D Touching the blue indicator that represents your location offers a quick shortcut to sharing your location with someone.

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/ieHElqS.png?1)

* 3D Touching any search result or point of interest on the map allows you to get directions, call, open homepage, or share location. Thanks to /u/metalhaze

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/GsAWjDN.png)

* 3D touching any app whilst in the app store will allow you to preview it

&gt; [Example](http://i.imgur.com/2cZl6Tj.png)

* Pressing harder onto the backspace / delete button when typing will delete text faster

* When pressing on the left side of your screen to activate the app switcher, you can push even harder instead of sliding to the right to open up the app switcher! Thanks /u/ventdivin

apple,2016 MacBook 12 from a Developers Perspective,"Hi All. Just wanted to chime in on my experience with the 2016 12"" MacBook. I've found peoples insights and experiences here invaluable and just wanted to finally contribute something back. Not sure how many developers frequent around here but nevertheless it might be of interest to some. I know I'm a bit late to the MacBook 12 discussions but thought I'd change it up a bit :)

I'm a full stack web and mobile App developer. On a regular basis I have most of Apple's stock Apps running (Notes, Reminders, Safari, Mail, Messages, Contacts) in addition to Xcode, iOS Simulator, Android Studio, Sublime, Terminal, Querious, ExpanDrive, Affinity Photo, Reeder, Tweetbot, Dropbox, Dash, Pocket and Numbers. I use Arq for backups. I also compile code through terminal as well as having MariaDB running locally. 

I'm a laptop guy and my go to main machine for many many years has always been a 15"" MacBook Pro with 16GB of ram which has always been more than enough. Recently portability has become much more important for me and when the 2015 MacBook 12 was released I knew that it would be way too underpowered for my work but the form factor just blew me away and I picked one up to give it a go to just for kicks. I used it as my main machine for 3 solid weeks and while I loved everything about it (even the keyboard and the smaller screen) it was just slow enough that my workflow suffered. What surprised me however was even though I knew it would be slower it wasn't as slow as I thought it would be. While I was disappointed I really wasn't surprised since I knew what I was getting myself into coming from a tricked out MBP. I ended up returning it but waited patiently for updated hardware.

When the 2016 MBP models got released I thought the 13"" would be perfect. I could get my 16GB of Ram and drastically reduce the bulk I needed to carry coming from a 2015 15"" MBP. For various reasons that aren't really worth getting into I ended up trying and returning the 13"". While the form factor was great I felt there were too many compromises in the hardware that didn't justify the costs. The USB-C ports were a non issue for me though since the only thing I ever use them for is connecting an iOS or Android device for testing.

When the MacBook 12 was updated in 2016 I dismissed it for a while until I started finding out about some of the internal changes such as the faster ram, disk and moderate CPU increases. When I realized that the M7 model pretty much always ran in Turbo Boost mode I started searching for other peoples experiences with the m7 model specifically and came away with a positive outlook to the point that I picked one up.

First I just have to give a big shout out to the work Apple has done on Migration Assistant. I backed up my 15"" MBP via SuperDuper to an external drive and then during setup on the MacBook 12 I used Migration Assistant to setup the new machine. In just over an hour everything was transferred over pretty much perfectly. I mean everything. Even oddball non standard stuff like custom build scripts in /usr/local/bin, my entire Brew setup with everything installed, Android SDK's, Java, power settings, keychains, Apps, everything. There were three things that I did have to deal with:

* For some reason my notification widgets got reset so I have to re-add them in. No big deal but odd.
* Microsoft Office forgot my license and reverted back to read only mode. I'm still fighting with Microsoft on releasing my license from my MBP 15 :(
* Had to re-sign into DropBox. Expected but not as seamless as everything else.

I never had to re-sign into my Mail accounts and only signed into iCloud once during setup. Fantastic. Makes switching hardware SO much easier.

Now onto the good stuff. I've been using the 2016 12"" M7 1.3 GHz 512GB SSD MacBook for 3 weeks and haven't had the need to power up my MBP once. This thing is absolutely amazing. I still can't believe how fluid everything is. I barely notice the slightly increased build times and I still can't believe that 8GB of Ram is enough for me. I haven't changed my day to day habits one bit. I still have all my Apps open at all times and am able to switch between them just as efficiently as on my souped up MBP.  The battery life is nothing short of spectacular. I always bring a charger with me when I'm on the go but never had to use it once. I haven't built up the courage to leave it at home yet but if I ever forgot it I wouldn't worry about it.

I still can't believe I can get all my work done on this device. The portability and decrease in bulk is actually life changing. I know that seems a bit over the top but it's true. I've actually switched bags because I have no need for a traditional laptop bag anymore. I don't feel burdened when I'm rushing around and the lack of weight on my back is something I still can't get over. I've compromised nothing in terms of functionality.

I completely realize the limitations of this machine doesn't work for everyone. I don't use SD cards or require devices plugged into it. I don't do video editing or require a large screen. I guess at the end of the day if there are any developers out there that think a MacBook is too underpowered I can tell you the 2016 m7 model might be worth looking into. I feel like my specific use case, while definitely not a casual user, is also not Pro in the sense that a video editor might fall into but I feel like there may be enough out there that think they need something more but may not. 

Once I get this whole Office license issue sorted out I'll be letting my 15"" MBP go and the 12"" MacBook will become the only Mac I own. Happy to answer any questions anyone may have. Cheers and thanks for all the great advice and sharing your stories!

AppleWatch,Explanation for why you're receiving exercise minutes when you're not exercising.,"**TLDR: now featuring long tldr** 

**Age Based Formula**

* Start with 220

* Subtract your age

* find 50% of that value

* When you're at around or above this heart rate for the entire minute you'll receive an exercise minute

**Karvonen Formula (Age w/ fitness level)**

* (If you don't own watch) Calculate average of atleast 3 Morning Resting Heart Rates. (With Watch) Take Average Resting Heart rate.

* Start with 220

* Subtract your age

* Multiply by 0.5 (50%)

* Add your Resting heart rate again

**EXAMPLE**

* Say you're 32 years old with a resting heart rate of 48. 

* (220 - 32) = 188

* (188 - 48) * 0.5 + 48 = 118


**INTRODUCTION**

A lot of you may be receiving exercise minutes on your watch when you're not exercising and even when you're sitting down.

Apples support page has done a poor job in explaining exactly how to determine when you should and shouldn't expect to receive these minutes so i'll help by explaining in more detail.

The watch has many different factor it considers when determining if you are burning enough calories each minute to be considered exercise. Those factors being movement, heart rate, and gps distance if in workout mode.

The most important being Heart Rate. (Honestly it's pretty much the only real factor)

**EXPLANATION**

Apple states that you will receive a minute every minute you're at or above the intensity of a brisk walk. Vague, yes. But a brisk walk defined by the CDC is walking at a pace of 3 Miles per hour. Which is on average 100 steps per minute. (Which is actually how much you need to step an hour to receive a standing hour. Between 100-120 depending)

But like i said, Heart rate is the most important/reliable factor to ensure you're getting your exercise minute. As stated by the American Heart Association to determine if you're reaching a level of moderate activity (the level of a brisk walk) Start with the number 220 and subtract your age. now calculate what 50% of that number is and when your heart rate reaches that number or close to it you should receive exercise minutes on your apple watch.

**KRAVONEN FORMULA**

The Kravonen Formula is used when you want to find a more accurate representation of what heart rate you want to be at when exercising. There are three tiers to this formula, Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3. To calculate this formula you will need to find and average atleast 3 of your morning resting heart rate values or if you own an Apple Watch just pull the resting heart rate calculated there. **NOTE** if you do not wear your apple watch to bed or wear it very often when you're truly resting do not use this resting heart rate from the watch. It will be inaccurate. So be sure to wear it a few nights when you go to sleep to make sure you get this number as accurate as possible. But after getting this number you will want to make note of the Maximum heart rate a standard heart can achieve. That being 220. This number will be subtracted by your current age in the formula. 

**Zone 1 Calculations**

* In this example you are a 32 year old with a resting heart rate of 48 bpm.

* (220 - 32) = 188

* (188 - 48) * 0.5 + 48 = 118

**Zone 2 Calculations**

* Still 32 years old with a 48 bpm resting heart rate.

* (220 - 32) = 188

* (188 - 48) * 0.7 + 48 = 146

**Zone 3 Calculations**

* Same freaking dude yo

* (220 - 32) = 188

* (188 - 48) * 0.8 +48 = 160

**CALORIES PER MINUTE**

Say by for some reason your heart rate monitor is broken, turned off, etc. How it and other trackers will calculate an exercise minute is by their ""step"" metric. Not necessarily a step but enough movement to be considered one. For the average person a step is equivalent to burning 0.044 calories according to the National Health Service. because you need between 100-120 steps in a 60 second time frame to receive an exercise minute you should be burning between 4.4-5.28 calories per minute.

apple,3D Touch is the most underrated iphone feature,"I got an iPhone 7 Plus a month ago after getting sick of years on Android and I love it to bits.

The feature though that I think is massively underappreciated on iOS and alternatives don't even come close on Android is 3D Touch. Force touching on messages to view them is probably the most handy thing ever, being able to preview things in Messages, Safari, Instagram or wherever is fantastic, or to move your cursor when typing, or accessing the multitasking screen from the side and even 3D touching to access a widget of an app or quick actions is great.

It's just a feature that's incredibly simple to understand and only Apple could do. Of course, it's not perfect, developer support for 3D Touch within is app is, it's fair to say, pretty terrible at the moment with only a handful on my phone actually supporting it.

And then this is written off as a gimmick in a lot of reviews I see and is never considered as advantage the iPhone has over Android. I'm surprised how good it is.",160,492,2017-01-26,AAPL,0.025578442960977554,0.9121271371841431,0.06229446455836296

* Street/Business View
* Walking directions that aren't just sidewalks on roads (my university is huge and Google Maps is super helpful to give lost people walking directions).  
* Indoor Mapping (while it's whatever for a store like Bestbuy, using it for multi-storied malls is super helpful).  
* Direct restaurant menu link on POI info card.  
* Historical crowdedness of locations. 
* Live crowdedness and historical visit duration (feature(s) just went live).  
* 3^rd party food delivery integration.  
* Hotel prices with competing booking sites (Apple just partners with them for photos).  
* Scheduled events at venues.  
* Questions asked to reviewers of a POI to gain more info.  
* Offline mode with POI data.

* Best vibration in any smartphone. Period.

* Apple is ""future thinking"" the wireless life? Yes. Are they agresive about it? Yes. Is the lack of a jack a pain in the ass? Yes. 

* Best camcorder. Period.

* Camera is on par with Samsung's but photo processing is top-notch. 

* If you are on videography or photography and you want a phone, iPhone is the best choice. Especially the 7+.

* A10 is lit. It is considered the best responsive phone for Marques. No phone is as smooth and responsive to that. The Pixel and the OPO 3T are there, but not there. 

* Battery Life is about the same as last year, okay, but not great. The 7+ is really good on battery.

ipad,The iPad Air I bought three years ago has been the most reliable and well-used piece of technology I've ever owned.,"I simply have never had a problem with it. Regular updates, great performance, beautiful screen, and a battery life that I simply can't believe has been improved upon! I'm still regularly getting 10+ hours of use out of a single charge with ease, and the standby time is beyond good. 

It's even a fairly rugged product, despite being as light as ""air"".  I've dropped mine, dropped things on it, spilled things on it, rolled joints on the front and the back of it. I've taken it all over the world and it's still got nothing more than a few scuffs and absolutely no visible scratches on the screen. 

When buying my first tablet I was thinking I'd be having to upgrade around this time (after three-ish years), but in all seriousness for my use case I think I can push another 2-3 years out of this thing.
