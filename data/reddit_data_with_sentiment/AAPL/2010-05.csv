apple,"BA in Philosophy, Writing and Poetics: ""false choice between Adobe's proprietary software and Apple's walled garden?"" NO! WRONG! HTML5 is NOTHING TO DO WITH APPLE AND IPHONE","Article on [arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/04/pot-meet-kettle-a-response-to-steve-jobs-letter-on-flash.ars?comments=1) by a FSF member who writes poems about peace and love. I don't mind that. I mind that he is confused as to why ""Flash versus HTML5"" has _ANYTHING_ to do with the legitimate way Apple reserves the right to control their own App store, offer such a service (which is great for user experience) and protect their earnings on it.

Just like Adobe were able to protect their crappy proprietary font business until Apple developed and innovated TTF, and used Microsoft of all people to help them get it adopted.

Apple has EVERY RIGHT to offer a business model the way they are doing. They have every right to offer a device with certain options, features, possibilities. I have a right to invent a bicycle with square wheels. FSF cannot claim I am offering a proprietary bicycle system if I am creating a bike for people to ride up and down stairs.

I have every right to invent a mousetrap that does not use nuclear fission as a power source. Do you hear that FSF? People make choices in their business models all the time.

I can say this, and AT THE SAME TIME, I've been negatively affected by Apple's choices. (or I should say, yes, I wanted to use undocumented APIs for the camera, I wanted to run my own scripting hacks on the iPhone (I did, I jailbroke it, but anyway) but that still doesn't give me the right to say Apple are wrong, _ANYMORE THAN I CAN CALL UP BASKIN AND ROBBINS AND TELL THEM THAT THEY ARE WRONG BECAUSE I DISLIKE ONE OF THE FLAVORS_)

&gt; Well how can you say this without feeling personally charged with task to tell Apple that they are wrong?

Stupid motherfuckers. How can I be PERSONALLY WRONGED by apple creating the iPhone? They could have not created it, and I still wouldn't have been able to write my own apps for it.

I want to see a more open world, but in this seed of a new industry, there was no other way to build such a device. By giving the user experience of browsing apps on a device, installing them, and giving app developers the chance to develop for such a store, with payments, build in audience, hosting and distribution solved, _not to mention great hardware and excellent APIs that only Apple teams seem to be able to develop to such high standards_, of course Apple have the right to quality check.

When you walk into a supermarket - do you realise **YOU ARE IN A WALLED GARDEN**. Do you **EVER** in your most insane moments, even dream that you can dictate to your supermarket that they should let anyone submit apps to them?

There is a huge value in a trusted, walled, cleanly sandboxed APId set of apps that you can chose from. A value that is immediately destroyed when you allow anything and everything. I know which I chose. It is the inability for the poem writing idiots of FSF to understand this distinction of service that makes the argument muddy.

Ignorance is not a point of view. Claiming Flash versus HTML5 has ANYTHING to do with Apple is INSANE.

And please join me in chanting, oprah-like:

###EVERYONE GETS AN HTML5 APP

That is, anyone can create an HTML5 app, today, for the iPhone. If you want native 3D and accelerometer (and offline app) pay the piper, because anything an iPhone user will use will reflect on the device itself. You cannot say it is an invalid business model. You cannot say you are personally injured by this. You cannot claim you want openness unless you can submit a copy of a letter you've sent to your supermarket asking the same.

Capiche? Ignorance, and inability to understand an argument IS NOT  A POINT OF VIEW (thank you, thank you and thank you Scott Adams)",106,42,2010-05-01,AAPL,0.04659223183989525,0.9236013293266296,0.029806483536958694
apple,Thank You AppleCare!,"Yesterday, I went to the Apple store to pick up my early 2008 MacBook. this was the 2nd time in 2 weeks -- trying to get a minor video issue fixed ( when I tried to output fullscreen video to my tv, the quality was bad on the tv, and the computer screen got all distorted ).  This time, it had been in repair for exactly 7 days, and I was anxious to get it back.

When I checked out the invoice, it showed that they had replaced the logic board, the hard drive, both 2GB sticks of memory, the airport, the fan, and the hard drive cable.  (pretty much a new computer right? I was pretty happy about it)  Well, I got it home, started the setup process, and all of the sudden, it just died.  I've never seen anything like it. I tried everything I knew, but it was just dead. I called Apple support and they told me to take it back to the store.

So I took it back (this was the 3rd time in 3 weeks).  This time, they didn't even try to check anything out.  They just offered me a new macbook to replace it!  And if that wasn't enough, they offered me an upgrade to a 13in MacBook pro for $200!  I know it's not unheard of, but I've been eying the new MBPs since they came out last month, and didn't know when I would be able to get one. Now I got one for $200!

Comex, member of the iPhone Devteam has released the new JB software called Spirit... 

from the site:

What's Spirit?

    * Spirit is an untethered jailbreak for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch on the latest firmwares.
    * Spirit is not a carrier unlock.
    * If you currently are using a tethered jailbreak, you have to restore to use Spirit. Do not upgrade if you use an unlock on an iPhone 3G or 3GS. (You can, however, restore to 3.1.2 if you have SHSH blobs for that version.) 

Requirements

    * Any iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch on firmware 3.1.2, 3.1.3, or 3.2.
    * An activated device: one not stuck on the Connect to iTunes or Emergency Call screen.
    * Any version of iTunes 9 (including 9.1.1).
    * Syncing with iTunes before trying this highly recommended.",130,143,2010-05-03,AAPL,0.0155603913590312,0.912273645401001,0.07216601073741913

apple,What's the verdict: iPad regret... or iPad love?,"When I bought my iPad last week there was a tiny voice in the back of my head saying, ""Don't do it! It's just a giant iPod touch!"" Naturally I ignored such sensible reasoning and purchased the device. 

But the reverse has happened than what I expected.. I love my iPad more than I thought I would. I can't put it down, and it has all but entirely replaced my laptop as my device of choice for web, email, video etc.... 

Now that everyone has had their iPads for a few weeks, my question is: Has anyone  regretted purchasing the iPad? Or are you as geeked out with it as I am? 

UPDATE:

Thank you all for your comments! Some things to add based on your comments and my observations:

1.) Are we ready to use the iPad in public yet? Answer: No it's still too new. I felt the same way about my iPhone, I wouldn't answer calls in public for the longest time.

2.) The iPad makes for a great bathroom-surfing device. (many of you posted this)

3.) One of the more remarkable effects the iPad has had on me is I've started to buy more digital content. Movies, games, apps I used to scoff at sometimes because I would have to use them on my tiny iPhone. But now I have no problem renting movies or buying games because the size and presentation is fantastic.

apple,Hey Apple redditors. I felt compelled to say...,"... that I finally understand. 

I just purchased and set up my first iMac. The packaging alone was enough to plant deep loyalty in my consumer's heart. Then I got a closer look at the design I had been scrutinizing for weeks on Apple's website. I work in a machine shop, and aluminum is a big part of my life. Wow. This thing is gorgeous. Then I went through the setup process and was greeted by about a half-dozen settings and customizations that I hadn't previously dreamed of.

I doubt I will ever purchase a PC again.


*Edit: Someone's comment asked if I'd give a list of things that have impressed me about this iMac. So here they are. I offer these from a simple perspective with humility. (I'm not a programmer, I don't work on my computer, this is just for home use.) Lots of these are going to sound pretty naive and dismissible. Oh well. Anything I noticed, I typed.*

Things I like about this iMac:

**OS and Usability**

* OS X's System Preferences layout and navigation is much nicer than Window's Control Panel.

* Fully customizable time and date layout. ( I love 1Jan2010.Monday, never thought I'd be able to read date that way on a desktop, though.)

* OS X's use of the [X] [ -] [+] buttons. Why ""maximize"" a browser window to cover your entire desktop, when you're reading an article that's ratioed like an A4? Why terminate a program when you have ample resources to just let it run, available for the next time you need it? 

* Apple's shortcut keystrokes, Corners, and Corners' assignment by user preference. 

* Spaces.

* Expose.

* Spotlight - It kicks Window's search in the shit. (Yes. That's right. The shit.)

* The Dock - I used RocketDock on my PC to make it navigate the way I'd prefer, Apple saved me some download time.

* Initiate an uninstall? Heck no. Throw that program in the trash. (I hear this has to do with Apple's having forgone anything like Window's registry.)

* Device display on desktop - No, I don't want to click on a minute fucking tray icon to find my flash drive in a list of indecipherable device labels, and I don't want to have to go back there to eject the drive. And no, I don't want to have to open My Computer to take a look at the disc that's in my tray. 


**Design**

* No tower. It fits on top of my desk. Right behind its monitor, usually. Oh shit. I lost it. Where did it go? Oh, there it is. iMac, you sneaky.

* Very accessible disk drive, ports.

* Built-in camera - Faproulette enabled, out-of-the-box.

* One power cord for the unit, versus two for a PC's monitor, tower.

* Mouse USB'd to the keyboard, more USB ports available for other stuff.

^ The above combine to make for a much neater, uncluttered desk space. I am loving it.

* Decent, integrated speakers - They didn't cost extra and sound good. (I have supplemental speakers. Decent ones. Had them plugged into the input port of the iMac for a good while and didn't even notice their absence.)

* This Keyboard - The fact that PC manufacturers en masse haven't  caught on the port-equipped keyboard is bewildering. Also, screen brightness, Expose, playback, volume, and eject buttons all right here? And not in the poorly integrated, ugly way that it was attempted on my PC keyboard? Nice.

* Apple Remote - enough said.",383,223,2010-05-08,AAPL,0.0504051111638546,0.9207426309585571,0.028852242976427078

apple,Steams coming out for Mac this month but how good is gaming on a Macbook pro?,"I'm considering trading in my desktop for a sleek and cool 15 or 17inch mac book pro, the only reservation I have is gaming.

My two concerns:

1. Non-valve games aren't going to get the mac steam treatment and I'll loose the ability to play them without boot camping (MW2, Bad company ect)

2. That the graphics capability in the 15 inch or 17inch models won't be enough to play these titles at a respectable frame rate.

I really do only use it for daily stuff mostly (surfing the net, mail, papers, etc.). The thing is if I could use it for the occasional gaming I would. 
Do you think the new fifteen inch is worth it if I want to do said occasional gaming? I'd like a computer that will be able to handle the upcoming Starcraft II and Diablo III.

So, yesterday I decided to download the full version of Adobe Digital Editions and use that instead - only to discover that the OSX version doesn't support my particular eReader - although the Windows version has supported it since the day it launched, last summer.

Being a bit of a geek I decided to poke around inside the app to see if I could get it to recognize my reader - and discovered that the !@#%$ thing was written for the PPC chip.

The PPC chip! Apple stopped shipping PPC-based Macs in 2005 and here it is, 5 years later, Adobe is still shipping apps that have to be run in Rosetta in order to work at all.

So I download a copy of Acrobat Reader and decided to take a look at that. Guess what I found? The file is called ""AdbeRdr930_en_US_ppc.pkg"". PPC. But, hey, maybe it's just a file name. Maybe they're shipping universal binaries.

So I drop into terminal and examine the Reader executables. Universal? Nope. ""AdobeReader: Mach-O executable ppc""

As far as I'm concerned, Apple should do everything in its power to shove Adobe into the grave. 

*Update* - **linkedlist** pointed to a URL where you can select an Intel-only download of Reader; but that doesn't explain why Adobe sends you a PPC binary by default or why they just don't ship universal binaries for ADE or Reader. Note that as I dug, I found that Flash and AIR both ship as universal binaries. Also - I can't find any place where you can download an Intel version of ADE - you have to install ADE through a goofy flash-based installer on Adobe's website.",46,39,2010-05-12,AAPL,0.06632225215435028,0.9072887897491455,0.026388956233859062

apple,"Thank you, Apple, for the real-5-hour battery on the Macbook Pros","Today I had an epiphany. After owning a white MB for some time, about a year ago I bought a mid-2009 MBP, the first ones with an integrated battery. It was the main reason for my purchase (well, that and the dual GPU, hoping that it would run Starcraft II)

So, today I realized that I've never suffered from battery shortages anymore. I mean, my laptop is usually plugged in when working, and I always keep an eye on the remaining battery percentage, as most of you probably do. 

But, whenever I've needed to work wireless for some time, either because of travelling, using my laptop at an outdoors party or something, I've never run out of battery. Ever.

If you've used a laptop, you probably get stressed when the battery level is around 10%. You have to rush to find a plug, or worse, if there is no one available, the laptop will shut down for sure. I'm talking about the *feeling*, if you know what I mean.

Now I know that even if I'm hammering the laptop by playing 720p youtubes (which pretty much uses all the subsystems: wifi, speakers, screen, cpu and HDD traffic) it will hold for 5 good hours. That's amazing. 

So, a short story to make my point here. I had a friend who, 10 years ago, when we started college, told me that he'd never buy a laptop which couldn't be used during a whole day. I replied that he'd never buy one, then, as it seemed impossible that batteries would last for more that 2-3 hours. He emailed me a couple of hours ago to ask if it were true that newer macbooks could last for 8 non-intensive work hours. 

And I realized that, finally, laptops are *complete*, as one can bring them anywhere and use them in any way, without having to think of batteries.

Just wanted to share my thoughts with you, Reddit :)

apple,"Is anyone else tired of the constant Apple bashing or worse, bashing users for choosing to purchase Apple?","I wasn't sure where to post this. If I posted this in AskReddit or anywhere else on Reddit, it would get heavily downvoted and I would be called a fanboy. 

Is anyone else tired of the constant Apple bashing? Also, it's not just the Apple bashing but also the insulting of users for choosing to purchase any Apple devices.

I remember I was thinking of buying a Macbook Pro back in August 2009 (the new Unibodies at the time) and the amount of hate really stunned me. People, whom I considered my friends at the time, started insulting me. First, they started telling me I was stupid for buying a paperweight. Then, I was stupid since I won't be able to play games. Finally, I was stupid since I can buy something with better hardware/performance for cheaper. That's when I got upset. I understand people want to give their opinions, but why do they have this desire to constantly tell me their opinions and why I am stupid  for doing what I want. 

This was only the beginning. After owning a Mac for a while and constantly being insulted/mocked for owning one, I started noticing how conversations would eventually dissolve into Apple hate.

Sidenote: This particular person got a fulltime job at Microsoft, and he is one of the biggest Microsoft fanboys you will ever meet. He constantly compares Microsoft to every other company and will straight away insult the company, even when they are not a competitor of Microsoft.

Me and the people I hang out with in my class (no longer consider them friends ... too many incidents not related to my Mac) were sitting at lunch. We were just discussing random technology things (typical computer engineering students) when all of the sudden the conversation switches to Ballmer's outbreak with the iPhone at the company meeting in October. All of a sudden the person mentioned above in the sidenote starts a rant on how Steve Jobs has a whiny voice. HE IS INSULTING THE GUY'S VOICE. I MEAN COME ON. Something, you really don't have a lot of control over. He doesn't just bring it up and end it quickly but keeps this going for at least 5 minutes when I chose to leave.

I don't know what to do anymore. It's as if they are on a witch hunt for anything Apple. If Apple does something, they are trying to ""control the competition"". Yesterday, I mentioned how Apple controls the iPhone hardware to control the user experience and I was told it was to control the competition. When I questioned RIM and BlackBerries...I was called a fanboy. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c4506/we_apple/c0q0zds?context=3) I mean, I hate some of Apple's choices (shitty drivers in OS X, poor performance of iTunes in Windows, etc.) but to call them out on anything they are doing or worse, making fun of someone's voice and calling them whiny?

I don't think I can handle this anymore. Even people who don't know what the hell they are talking about are insulting Macs. ""They cannot play games"", ""A notebook is better than an iPad"", ""A bigger iPod"". The best is ""Too expensive"". I mean, if I can afford it, why should I not buy it? Do you make fun of people who own Ferraris. It is out of our price range, but it is in theirs. My Toyota can get me from Point A to Point B just as well as a Ferrari but for a fraction of the price.

Nowadays Firefox just feels like bloatware to me. Initially speedy and fine, it slows down over time as the pipes fill up with cludge from unseen sources. It always happens, without fail. Great community, great plugin support, just not great optimization for the OS.

**Chrome**

apple,I've had my iPad for over a week now and I love it except for one thing...,"...and that is, why the hell does Safari insist on reloading pages that, in my opinion, don't need reloading?

This was annoying on my iPhone 3G, but it's totally insane on the iPad.  Particularly when the page being reloaded is all text, such as a reddit page, and it's only one of 2 or 3 pages I have open, not the 6-9 pages Safari is presumably capable of having open at the same time.

Except for this particular gripe, my iPad could seriously replace my laptop for most web browsing.

**Edit: The consensus appears to be that I should give iCab and Atomic Browser a try, and that restarting the iPad (or forcing mobile Safari to quit and restart) is a good work-around for the issue.  Thanks for the suggestions.**

So I figured I'd list them here and you can download Second Shootr if you'd like? I'd appreciate some constructive feedback through http://secondshootr.uservoice.com and if you want to rate and review the app through iTunes, I'd be very grateful.

For those who don't know, Second Shootr is an application aimed towards professional photographers. It helps them organise and keep track of their shoots and clients.

If you use a code, please leave a comment to let others know which one has been taken.
