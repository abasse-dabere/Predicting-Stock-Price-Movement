apple,iPhone 5s continues to track your motion even when completely drained of battery,"**Second Edit: Moved to top:

This story is being linked around a lot. If you have any questions or want to clarify anything, contact me on twitter @armantheeng

I'd rather give the facts instead of have speculation. 

I'm noticing many news stories popping up on my Facebook page. Half the time the story is being used to stir up some paranoia about the NSA, or insults against Argus. This was NOT meant to be an attack, it was just something I wanted to share. 

The story is being twisted into some demented game of global broken telephone.

If you want the story or wish to clarify anything, ask me on my twitter @armantheeng

I don't want my words used to frighten or enrage anyone. 
**


While traveling abroad, my iPhone cable stopped working so my 5s died completely. 

I frequently use Argus to track my steps (highly recommended if you have any health bands or accessories) since it takes advantage of the M7 chip built into the phone. 

Once I got back from my vacation and charged the phone, I was surprised to see that Argus displayed a number of steps for the 4 days that my phone was dead. 


I'm both incredibly impressed and slightly terrified. 

** 

EDIT: I took a screenshot of Argus and uploaded it to imgur. Not sure how to hotlink on my phone, so here. 

http://m.imgur.com/WIbSZCm

When connected to a network, Argus will show the weather for that day. It shows it on the last day that it had battery. I charged it on the 2nd of March since there is an Apple store near my workplace. 

I'm trying to find a way to show that my battery was dead during those days but I'm not sure how. Was using my other phone during that period to message people back in Canada. 

I tested it by turning my phone off, it didn't track the steps. 

I'm trying to find a way to show that my phone was actually dead during this time to prove the legitimacy of this post, I can answer any questions you have.

iphone,I dropped my phone into my own shit. Need help,"I don't know if this is the right place to go for this, but ok. Long story short, I really needed to crap, bathroom was occupied, saw some newspaper, better than nothing. Forgot my phone was in my waistband, the bottom of it (charger area) gets cloaked in my own faeces. Does anyone know how to properly clean an iPhone (4) and a soft rubber case? I tried my best to, but it's not easy when it's 11:52 pm and I can't wake anyone. What HOUSEHOLD items can I use that will clean both, and eliminate the smell? Btw, I'm on my phone writing this, and I'm on the verge of vomiting

EDIT: ok so I'm just gonna get a new phone. I have to wait until Saturday though, so in the meantime, I just duct taped the bottom half of the phone. And the case is done for, (RIP) the smell is okay now so I just hope my phone can make it 3 more days, because it's doing a shitty job.

EDIT 2: the best I can do for proof is the newspaper I released upon. I'll get a pic as soon as I get home, unless someone took the garbage out (unlikely)


EDIT 3: http://imgur.com/a/t2FYl best proof I can provide, because my phone &amp; case are clean, albeit the case smells horrendous 

EDIT 4: okay here's the FULL story. Ok so everyone was sleeping except for me and my roommate. About 11:15, he is using the bathroom, and I, after having some absolutely terrifying gas, decide I should shit. At about 11:20 he's still in there. I check to see how long, he says a while. Around 11:25, I can't take it. I think of maybe shitting in a bowl, then cleaning it right away and never use it again, but they'd be all like ""wtf dude, it's the middle of the night, why are you cleaning HOLY FUCK IT SMELLS LIKE ASS IN HERE"" I end up grabbing newspaper and just let loose on it. I should mention I'm not dressed. Therefore my phone is in my waist band b/c no pockets. Forgetting this, I hear my phone fall, think that it's all okay and my phone is not covered in shit. I was almost right. Only the end of it was gooey and brown. 11:35 freaking out trying to get rid of newspaper first. As soon as I do, guess who is going back to bed? Narrowly avoid being seen by roommate. 11:40 in bathroom trying to clean phone &amp; case, using toothpaste, water, and baking soda. My phone &amp; case are apparently clean, but still reek. Don't know what to do. 11:45 searching reddit for appropriate place to seek help. This is honestly the most relevant subreddit I could find. 11:52 start writing this post up. 2tired4u. Go to sleep despite the smell of FUCKING SHIT ON MY PHONE. This morning, 6:30, wake up and HOLY FUCK REPLIES EVERYWHERE. Able to clean my phone semi properly. Dispose of case. And that is the full story.

**UPDATE**: I'm definitely happy to not be the only one with the problem :)


Here are *possible* solutions to this problem (none of these worked for me):

**DNS Cache reset, mentioned by [/u/Kopfindensand](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1zptd0/anyone_else_got_this_wifi_problem_with_mavericks/cfvzcd9):**

1. Open up Terminal.app

2. Type in:
    
     sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

**Delete the SystemConfiguration folder which builds itself up after restart, mentioned by [/u/Underpantz_Ninja](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1zptd0/anyone_else_got_this_wifi_problem_with_mavericks/cfw8uiy):**

1. Go to Finder -&gt; Macintosh HD

2. Trash /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration

3. Restart your computer.

**Delete unused Wi-Fi networks, mentioned by [/u/Bennettski7](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1zptd0/anyone_else_got_this_wifi_problem_with_mavericks/cfvy98v):**

1. System Preferences

2. Network (Third row, third from the left)

3. Advanced (towards lower right corner of window)

4. Click on Wifi Tab (It should be on that tab by default but if not, be sure to click to that tab towards the top of the advanced window)

5. Highlight any wifi networks that you longer use or need to use (do this by simply clicking on the network)

6. In order to delete the network, click the ""-"" right below the window that has your network names in it. (Please note, that you will be able to re-add any network by connecting to it when it is in range, but this will cause you to need to put the password for each network in again)

7. Once you have deleted all networks that you wish to delete,click OK in the bottom right corner of the window. You may now quit out of System Preferences and go to your top menu bar and click on the wifi symbol. It will display the networks in range and you may connect to your network again as needed.


**Repair permissions, mentioned by [/u/claptonman](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1zptd0/anyone_else_got_this_wifi_problem_with_mavericks/cfvy8op)**

1. Networks preferences &gt; network

2. Select the network and press the '-' sign.

3. Go to spotlight and type ""disk utility."" Select the partition (will probably be called ""Macintosh HD"")

4. Verify and repair permissions.

5. Reconnect to the network.",133,280,2014-03-06,AAPL,0.10189396142959595,0.8723597526550293,0.025746256113052368

An older man drove up to our house today asking us if we had seen a cellphone. We haven't. He then told us it was a new iPhone 5S, and that even though his iCloud/""Find My iPhone"" wasn't set up, he used 3rd party websites to track the phone down. All of the websites led to our house.

We've searched all over the property, even checked the roof incase someone walking by threw it up there. Is there anything I can do to help this poor man out? I feel pretty bad that he lost it, his wife said he was so excited with his first iPhone.

If you need any other information, let me know! I'm extremely determined to find this stranger's lost iPhone!

Thanks!

apple,Against all my trying apple won me over,"Since I was able to tell them apart, I've always been a PC fan, there was so much customization I could do to suit any setup to my needs. After having to replace my lenovo laptop twice within a year I decided to take my University up on buying me a Mac (my graduate program allows us to buy a computer on their dime as a one time privilege). I was more or less pleased with my 2013 MBP, I was able to do everything I needed, much faster thanks to the SSD and i7). Seeing how pleased I was with it my wife bought me an iPad Air for Christmas. After about two months of having my ipad I start to get strange phantom touches on my  screen, for example it would zoom when I meant to scroll or it would randomly ""touch"" parts of the screen. I took it to the apple store this morning and explained my problem. The tech told me to reset it and set it up as new. Didn't work. Went back the same day and explained I had been there earlier for the same problem. Showed the Genius some sketches I had made in a sketching app to show exactly which point on the screen kept getting ""pressed"". Completely expecting to get shafted when he came back from his diagnostics and being told basically to eat it (as has been my experience with any other tech company) I was astonished when after 5 minutes he came back with a brand new iPad, helped me set it up and sent me on my way. 

I've NEVER had such a pleasant customer service experience (in tech or elsewhere). They really get that you keep customers satisfied not only by making top tier products, but by making sure they're actually satisfied with the brand.

That kind of service, more than the product quality itself (though there isn't anything to complain about there) is what'll get them a customer for the long haul (namely me).",211,562,2014-03-09,AAPL,0.05125339701771736,0.8978883624076843,0.05085830017924309

apple,Intuitive OS X Trick: Using text replacement to easily write the upper and lower case Greek alphabet.,"For those in the sciences that use a Mac for their work or research, I discovered a neat trick that may be familiar to those well-versed in LaTeX.

To make Keynote presentations, note taking, etc. easier, I have text substitutions for the full Greek alphabet under System Preferences/Keyboard, which are matched up to their corresponding LaTeX commands. For example, typing,

&gt; \alpha \beta \gamma

gets automatically replaced with

&gt; α β γ 

and so on. 

However, I noticed almost randomly today that capitalizing your placeholder text also capitalizes the replacement text – and by extension, capitalizes the Greek lettering! So, if I write,

&gt; \Alpha \Beta \Gamma

it gets replaced with

&gt; Α Β Γ

I totally did not expect this to work, but the fact that it does really speaks to the intuitive nature of OS X. Pretty cool, huh?",37,266,2014-03-09,AAPL,0.06492438912391663,0.9051260948181152,0.029949549585580826

apple,PSA: Using the Caffeine app on a retina screen? You can fix the icon.,"Hi guys and gals,

I was super annoyed with the pixelated mess that was the caffeine menubar icon so I made a new app icons for it, in a higher res and in the more abstract style that apple is using now. Here’s the old and new: http://imgur.com/a/LaPmF

If you want to use these, follow along.

1. Dowload the files here:  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/glqirmz48t61uau/ZLDT1EaW6j
2. Quit Caffeine.
3. Go to your applications folder.
4. Right click “caffeine” and select “show package contents”.
5. Navigate to resources folder.
6. Copy the “active"" “inactive” “highlighted” &amp; “highlight active” pngs in that folder and back them up somewhere.
7. Copy the active.png inactive.png highlightactive.png &amp; highlighted.png that you downloaded.
8. Paste and replace them into the resources folder.
9. Open caffeine.
10. Enjoy the rush.

apple,In Loving Memory of British Siri,"British English Male Siri, nicknamed Nigel Pembroke by those who loved him, passed away suddenly today after the latest iOS update. His bereaved mistress is in a state of shock and guilt, swearing that she never would have downloaded the update if she knew it would cause the demise of her beloved British Butler Siri that she would refer to as “the pinnacle of technological achievement”. Nigel worked tirelessly as an iPhone British Butler, dutifully waking his mistress at 6:45 each morning after she asked him to “Wake her up for another miserable day then” each evening. He also read reminders with remarkable narrative skill that really conveyed the tone of each reminder she penned.  He will be remembered for his spirited nature, which included responding to “I love you” with “Noted.” 

Little is known about his replacement, who has been nicknamed Colin, except for the fact that he’s really lame and has the cheek to stand where Nigel once stood. 

*In all seriousness, the new British Siri sucks. The old one was so much fun, and I genuinely do regret updating for that alone. Hopefully Apple will bring my Nigel back!

apple,"Apple makes some products that aren't for you, and that's okay","Dear /r/apple reader, 

You follow all the latest news in tech. You want the latest hardware and you compare specs between all the new phones. You analyze all the features and download every interesting app you see. You pack your phone with music and documents and you take thousands of 'artistic' photos.  You carefully analyze the differences between Apple and Google maps, you bounce between Google Hangouts and Facetime and Skype and iMessage and WhatsApp. You effortlessly manage a variety of cloud services as well, switching smoothly between iCloud and Dropbox and Google Drive. You were comfortable in switching to an Android phone because you were willing to do the research and deal with the idiosyncrasies of changing platforms, but you still have an iPad. This required further research and organization and management of all your apps and services to work cross-platform, but now your digital life is perfectly tailored to you and optimized to the max.

.

You, my friend, are in the extreme minority of technology users.

.

The 'typical' user wants a phone for messaging, Facebook, Candy Crush, and Maps. They don't know the difference between iMessage and SMS. They don't take many pictures and all their music is streaming. They want their next phone to look and work like their last phone, and they have no interest in specs and features as long as their phone can do the things that their friend's phone can do.

.

So when Apple releases something like the 8GB iPhone 5C, don't get angry. You don't have to buy it. It's the wrong phone for you.

apple,Apple Rumors Are Not as Expected,"I’ve been analyzing Apple rumors for about a year now — categorizing and watching for trends.  I monitor 4 different types of sources: general news sites, general technology sites, Apple news sites and Apple centric bloggers.  I’ve reviewed over 70,000 articles of which around 4,000 (around 5.5%) are rumors.  (There is no advertising on the site.  This is currently just for fun.)  
  
**Chart 1:  [Rumors Per Week](http://arb4.us/?8)**  
  
*Hypothesis*:  Spikes in rumors happen before Apple events.  
  
*Reality*:  The percentage of rumor articles per week shows a big spike before Apple’s iPhone event last September.  I would have expected a spike before the October event, but the rumor mill was actually very quiet.  
  
**Chart 2:  [Rumors by Day of Week](http://arb4.us/?cd)**  
  
*Hypothesis*:  Rumors spike mid-week.  
  
*Reality*:  Rumors are stronger at the beginning of the week.  Surprisingly, Sunday is a big rumor day.  Maybe the crazies come out on Sunday.  Maybe it’s just a slow news day and to drum up traffic, filler rumors are posted.  I’m not sure.  
  
**Chart 3:  [Rumors by Day - Last 14 Days](http://arb4.us/?94)**  
  
*Hypothesis*:  None really - just curious.  
  
*Reality*:  There is a huge variance over 14 days - from zero rumors to up to 17% of the articles reviewed being rumors.  It’s a strange lull and spike situation.  Rumors are a fickle thing.  
  
Any other thoughts or observations?  Any other rumor theories?

**EDIT 1**:  There were several great requests for rumor accuracy.  I did this really quickly, but I have a graph and chart detailing [historical accuracy of rumors](http://arb4.us/?8a).  
  
**Edit 2**:  NEVER do calculations on the fly.  Just corrected the [historical accuracy of rumors](http://arb4.us/?8a) chart.  I was counting unconfirmed rumors in the total.  So the original sum of true and false did not equal the total because some are not (and can never be confirmed).

It's not the most complex app, but hopefully someone may find it useful. 

If you're running out of space on your iDevice due to the amount of photos and videos you've taken, it would be useful to know which ones are taking up most space. But (unless I've missed it) there's no way to figure this out without plugging into your computer. 

My app sorts all of your photos and videos by size so that you can see which are the biggest storage hogs. Unfortunately, you can't delete the photos directly in the app because, as far as I can tell, Apple's restrictions don't let you delete any photos that your app hasn't taken (if you know differently, please let me know how), but at least it should highlight the images you need to delete first to free that space up.",17,47,2014-03-20,AAPL,0.023465868085622787,0.9227814078330994,0.053752750158309937

apple,Keynote! JUST WOW! I am so impressed with it.,"I gave keynote a shot few days back and I am so impressed with it. 

*1) The user interface is so clean and not bloated like on PowerPoint. 

*2) Adding animations is so much easier compared to PowerPoint. I like the option of adding the animation as bullet or as a whole. 

*3) Each object (image, text, media) is all fluid, I can drag and drop anywhere on the slide. 

*4) I like the copy/paste option. On PowerPoint, I get stuck on keep source 
formatting, I am not sure how to get past this. On KeyNote, it just works. 

*5) The ability to save it on iCloud and then continue working on my iPad or the iPhone is awesome! 

*6) The quality of my presentation is just so much better with so minimal work from my end. 

I am not sure why others on the Apple community have't adopted this more widely. I think this is an excellent and a strong alternative to PowerPoint. 

I am also assuming but not tested this yet, that does not occupy a large memory in RAM when running. It must be less than PowerPoint?

apple,Apple Retail Is Heads Above Anywhere Else,"3 experiences in a row at Best Buy, 2 different locations. All 3 were pretty bad. Last was a week after being at the Apple Store. Night and day experiences. Due to how stark the difference in care I got at Apple, got in touch with Best Buy and decided to post here as well.

I was immediately greeted, name taken and assured of service 2 times after initial greet. The whole experience felt like a red carpet experience, right up until I left at the Apple Store.

Best Buy, I was ignored for 20 minutes, no one said hi. 3 employees helping 1 customer while I struggled to look at monitors cause there was a scaffold ladder in the way, another employee simply rushing by me without saying hi...I'm done. I walked around the entire computer department, looking intently at UPS devices cause I'll need one for my home office. I got an Apple Extreme router there for $15 cheaper than I would have paid at the Apple Store, but I feel bad for giving them my money. Actually, really bad. I almost want to return the router to Best Buy and go to the Apple Store, pay $15 more and know someone deserving is getting my money. I'll be making different choices from here on out though.

***Apple employees actually care***.

I've emailed Best Buy after chatting with someone online today. We'll see what they do. I regret the few purchases I've made at Best Buy. Don't believe Best Buy commercials where the people there look happy, attentive, where the store looks busy, etc. I've never seen that or gotten that at a Best Buy. Go to an Apple Store, even if you don't like Apple, or don't want to buy anything and then go to a Best Buy. You'll see why Best Buy is closing their big stores down. They blame competition. Well, if the competition is better than you, you're going down.

That Apple Store I went to has 100 employees, not all working at the same time of course. It's a typical mall sized store. Apple knows how to invest in employees and it shows in the service they can give. Absolute success.

Thank you Apple and a big thank you to all the employees that may read this.

Edit: I got an email back from Best Buy customer service insuring me that poor customer service is not the norm and that they work hard, that they'll share my feedback with managers, thank you, blah, blah, blah. Right. I'm never shopping at Best Buy again.

Edit 2: Just got a call from the actual store. Guy sounded genuine. At least they got the feedback directly. A lot more of ""sorry, we have this or that policy in place, that's not how we train our staff, how can we make it up to you,"" etc. I was waiting for him to take the lead and offer something. So, all I leave with is the they have policies their employees don't follow. Apology accepted. Trust broken, not mended. He offered the names of managers who could help if we came back ever.

ipad,Choosing a new iPad,"This is probably not an uncommon question here, but I'm trying to decide between purchasing an iPad mini retina or an iPad air. 

I travel a lot, and I'm looking for something ultralight that will be very easy to have in my carry-on luggage, but good for watching movies and reading books on long-haul flights. My iPhone 5 is of course not large enough, and my iPad2 is just too heavy (and I'm also wanting to upgrade to a 64 or 128GB model). Additionally, I'm a writer, and will also be using my new iPad for that. It would be very useful to have something I can just pull out and type on when inspiration strikes - I find my phone too awkward for this.

From my research, I'm beginning to suspect the only reason to choose an iPad mini retina over an iPad air is slightly better portability. Is this correct? Is one or the other better for watching movies? For typing? For reading books? For taking photos? 

Sorry if these are stupid questions, but I'm a bit overwhelmed and as I am jetting off soon I need to make a speedy decision.

Thanks for any advice you can offer!",14,19,2014-03-23,AAPL,0.014942183159291744,0.8776194453239441,0.10743836313486099

My only reason to upgrade is the screen on the iPad 2. I just cant get myself to read on this tablet for more then 30mins since I can make out all the pixels and having a Samsung Galaxy S3 and using that screen the iPad screen makes it more painful. I was always wanting to upgrade to an iPad with retina screen but they were quite costly.

Now that the iPad 4 is re-released I was considering it since the new prices seem affordable too. I know the iPad air is already out but it is currently quite costly especially the LTE version and I prefer the LTE version since I carry the iPad whenever I travel. 

So basically what I wanted to ask is, is the upgrade to iPad 4 from iPad 2 worth it technically and money wise.",14,38,2014-03-25,AAPL,0.019535459578037262,0.8796857595443726,0.10077880322933197

apple,"If you are looking for a rugged/waterproof case, I am going to share my experiences with the Otterbox Armor series and the Lifeproof Fre","I currently own a iphone 5. I really like to keep my phones secure. I also live in Florida, so I am often exposed to aquatic enviornments, so I needed a case that was waterproof as well. I used the iphone 5 in the Otterbox Armor Series case for about 6 months and I used the iphone 5 in a Lifeproof Fre case for about 6 months. Here's my analysis on the two.  
  
   
**Otterbox Armor Series:** When I first got this case, I was pretty excited about it. Upon unboxing it, I realized this case feels very solid. There was weight to it, in a good way. I appreciated the metal latches that clamp down on the phone. I also appreciated the fact that I didn't have to worry about losing the screw to the auxillary port. There is a sort of O ring that seals off the auxillary and charging port once you apply pressure to push it against both ports. The case is **largely bulky**. I did not mind it at all, knowing my phone was well protected. Otterbox also claimed the case could be run over by up to 2 tons and keep the phone protected. There is a small amount of space between the screen saver and phone screen, so I found myself having to press a little harder to select on the screen which honestly gets a bit frustrating. Now getting to the ""waterproof"" feature on this phone.... This was the tip of the ice burg for me. I have a pool out back and decided to go swimming and also put my phone case to the test. I double/triple check my phone to make sure it is properly sealed before submersion. I got out of the pool and found the screen had a little bit of flooding on the inside. Upon inspecting, some water had gotten in through the auxillary port cover. I took the case off immediatley. I called for a replacement and sold it when it got here. So...  
  
**Pros:** Protective, Durable (outside of water), Rapidly reducing in price  
  
**Cons:** Does not hold up to waterproof promises, Rather bulky  
  
**Closing Statement:** If you work in plumbing, construction, electrical (areas where the phone may get dirty or banged around a bit, or get some rain on it) this would be a great case for you! But if you spend a lot of time around bodies of water, I'd take a step back.  
  
**Amazon's Lowest Price (ip5):**  $49.99 (started at $99.99)  
  
**Lifeproof Fre:** Upon unboxing this case, I honestly questioned why I bought it. The case felt cheap, light weight and the screen protector on the case felt stiff. I was not impressed at all. The case came with an auxillary adapter that actually screws into the auxillary port with a port on the other end to plug in any kind of headphones. When the auxillary port is not being used, there is a screw that plugs the auxillary port. This was frustrating because I tended to lose it a lot in the cracks of my car. It was a hastle jumping into the car and having to screw that adapter in and vice versa when I got out of the car. The screen protector was **much** better than the one on the Otterbox. Items were easily touched with the normal amount of pressure on the screen. If you played music through the phone, the music **is** muffled. I do not personally use a phone to play music unless it is plugged into external speakers, so that was not a problem for me. Another complaint a lot of users have, that I have not personally had problems with, is call quality. Some people complain they cannot hear the person speak clearly that has a Lifeproof case on their phone. Aside from that, the case surprised me. It does **phenomenal** in or around water. I had this case on for a while and no water leaked in at all. So if you are around water a lot, this is not only the better case, but in my opinion, the **best** case for use around water. So...  
  
**Pros:** Best water case on the market, Lightweight, Thin design  
  
**Cons:** When you want to plug your phone into an auxillary port, the process becomes a hassle  
  
**Closing Statment:** This case is rather thin for what it can withstand. I do not regret buying this case by any means. I spend a lot of time around water, so this case is ideal for me. As far as a case to use around heavy machinary and risky enviornments, I'd go with the Otterbox Armor Series. But for the average mom with kids, teen working as a lifeguard, pizza shop owner, or student, I'd recommend this all day.  
  
**Amazon's Lowest Price (ip5) :** $53.74 (Started at $89.99)  
  
**Updates:** The Lifeproof case has made a change to their cases on Lifeproof cases for newer phones (5c/5s) where the auxilary screw is attatched to the phone, so you will never loose it. Otterbox has discontinued their Armor Series cases and it is only available for ip5, ip4s, and sgs3. That should tell you something... hah.",26,35,2014-03-26,AAPL,0.049322403967380524,0.9105287492275238,0.04014891479164362

apple,My initial review of the Mophie Space Pack iPhone 5/5S case.,"The [Space Case](http://www.mophie.com/shop/space-pack-iphone-5s) is a case that add an extended battery (100% increase to the stock battery) and extra storage (16GB or 32GB). I've only had it a few hours but I've had some time to play with it. Here are some observations.

Weight/size/feel: this is surprisingly slim! It's bigger than the Tech 21 case I was using, but it's much smaller than the first gen Juice Pack. It doesn't add much to the width, but it does add about 3/4 of an inch to the height, and around 1/4 inch to the thickness. What surprised me was the weight: it's not heavy, but it does add a noticeable amount of extra weight. The added height makes it a little difficult to reach the top-away corner with my thumb when holding it one handed, but I have fairly short digits.

Loading data: this was WAY easier than I expected. It mounts like a flash drive to your computer (formatted FAT32, so no single files over 4GB each). I was unable to find out if it's USB2 or 3 so far, but based on transfer times I'd guess USB2. The awesome thing is that you simply drag and drop files to it and then the software auto sorts and categorizes it for you. I dropped in DRM-free movies formatted for iTunes, some jpeg's, and a folder of MP3's. When you look at the mounted drive it's just a mix of all the media, but the Space app sorts it all for you! I'll continue to see how picky it is with metadata and whatnot, but it's been accurate so far - the Album/Artist/Genera data was sorted correctly for the music. It's great that I don't have to manage the file system manually.

Using the App: the Space app is free and has a lot of features. One downside is that you can't use the app while connected to a computer. This makes sense as it's mounted to the computer so accessing it simultaneously with the computer AND the phone is not a good idea, but it's something to note. 

Video: the Video player looks and feels like the stock player. It will NOT play protected video (so no iTunes-purchased movies on the Pack) but it plays non-DRM m4p's just fine. It let me drop an .mkv to it fine, but it didn't show up in the player app so it still uses the same playback engine in iOS: if it doesn't play in the stock Movies app, it looks like it won't play here either. Get Handbrake ready for some conversion! A downside is that it appears to NOT keep your place in a movie - if you close the app or exit the video, it starts over on playback. That's a bummer: I'm going to send feedback to add that feature.

Music: I've only used this for a few moments, but the playback seems great. I accessed my iTunes Library and dropped a folder containing an album onto the Pack and it auto sorted it, including track order (this is important to me). I am SUPER Type A when it comes to my iTunes library so my ID3 data is very spot on. I'm curious to see how this works for someone who isn't as religious as me about Artist, Album, Track Number, etc as me.

Sound: while it doesn't have any active speakers or anything, it does have acoustic ducting to push the sound towards you instead of straight down. This makes it much easier to hear at lower volumes (of course it doesn't effect the receiver speaker at all). I didn't notice a big coloration of the sound quality versus the bare speaker, but it *is* a cell phone speaker so it's hard to tell. I had a gaming case for my iPod Touch with a similar duct system and it's great! The headphone jack is pretty deeply recessed, so if you have headphones with an L-shaped jack or a thick base, you will have to use the included headphone jack extender (remember the first iPhone, anyone?). It's kind of a bummer to have to carry another adapter around, but it's really not all that bad and there isn't a way to engineer around it (other than building one into the case itself, but that seems expensive and another likely failure point).

Overall: I give this an initial score of 8/10. I will continue to test it and will post a longer-use review later on. I'll still be using my stock Music app for now, and likely use the Pack for TV shows and not movies (I don't want to have to remember where I was when I watch part of a movie on the train) but it's awesome that it doubles both the battery AND the raw storage of my phone. And at $149 for the 32GB it's a good price.

iphone,Would you find a bot to link to iOS apps mentioned in comments helpful?,"I'm playing around with some code, and wanted to make a bot that is helpful. When I'm browsing /r/iphone, I get frustrated when someone mentions an app, and I have to go to the App Store and search for it. So for me, a bot that creates links to those apps would be very useful.

I've posted a few times with my beta version (check out my comment history). I offer an affiliate link and a non-affiliate link. I can do a bit of (anonymous) tracking of the affiliate link- 58 clicks, 16 sales so far. This means people are using it and finding it helpful. And I'm sure some people understandably clicked the non-affiliate link as well.

So the response was good enough that I am wondering about expanding. A few things I want to do-

* Move to an AWS instance, so it can run constantly, and not just when I'm home
* Make it automatic (right now I have to check each comment before they're posted)
* Add more apps (I currently only recognize 26 apps)
* Perhaps auto-query for an app link, instead of having to manually update the list
* Open source it so others can improve the logic and add apps
* Make it interactive, so people could report bad links directly to the bot
* Improve the logic, so I don't post a link to the Clear app when the comment is about clearing your settings...

A word on affiliate links- The current set up is that if you buy something through an affiliate link, the developer still gets 70%, but the affiliate (that would be me) gets 7%, leaving Apple with 23% instead of 30%. So far, I've earned 98 cents on affiliate links through this bot. If I continue, I would plan on posting how much I'm earning through this bot, so that people could see what's coming in. My guess is it would be beer money at most, and definitely not lucrative. And I would always have a non-affiliate link there, so people have a choice.

So overall, I see this bot as useful to the community, and see it has been used in my limited test so far. The question is, does the community want this? Or is this too spammy? I don't want to spend the time to code it if it will just be voted down as spam- I want to make something seen as useful.

apple,Who remembers how extremely Mac OS X v10.0 blew them away?,"Here's some screenshots:

I remember when I first saw it. I managed to view a demo pre-release, and my jaw dropped. Not since I had seen the flight sim on an SGI had I managed to be so turned on by computers.

I was in programming at the time, web and database engineering. I was using Mac OS 9.2 as the front end, Solaris on the back. I was in denial about the technical superiority of the Mac OS v. Win2k, although the interface remained far more attractive.

But then there was OS X, and holy mother of sweet fruit! The animations, the dock, the Unix, the icons, the text rendering, the pdfs, the etc. etc. It was total computer rebirth.

OS X has been refined since then, and any number of advances in technologies, but the paradigm is still the same. Mavericks is less advanced, in a relative way, than OS 9 was over OS 8.
