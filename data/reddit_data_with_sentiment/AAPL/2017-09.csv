apple,[TIP OF THE DAY] One thing I can't live without in MacOS - No dock delay.,"Regular MacOS dock delay is so long that you hate to use its autohide option. There is a one trick tho (with autohide turned on). Just copy and paste the whole code below into terminal and hit enter, it disables the delay and changes the duration of animation to 0.4:  
  
&gt;*defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0  
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.4  
killall Dock*  
  
*hit Enter*  
  
**0** in delay means that there is no delay at all, and **0.4** is how long the animation will take. To back into default settings just do the same with this code:  
  
&gt;*defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay  
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier  
killall Dock*  
  
*hit Enter*

They were doing this for everyone bringing in broken phone screens because of Hurricane Harvey. He said people are having a hard enough time, no need to add to the burden.

apple,It's 2017. Why are the ringer and alarm volumes STILL linked?,"I was late for something pretty important this morning, and I couldn't figure out why at first. I set my alarms(s) last night like I normally do, and they went off this morning like they normally do. 

The problem, as it turns out, is the volume on the alarms was set to the lowest bar, which means I didn't hear it. My suspicion is that it got turned down when I was trying to watch a video on YouTube. 

See, sometimes when you click a video link, there's this lag before it starts playing, and if you're trying to pre-emptively turn down the volume on the video there's a good chance you'll be turning down the volume on the ringer if you do it in the few seconds before the video fully loads. It's up to you to catch this. 

I suspect that's what happened, and that's on me. But for the love of God, why isn't there a volume slider control in Settings that let's you set separate volumes for ringers and alarms. To my mind, ringers and alarms are absolutely NOT the same thing and 10 seconds looking on their forums reveals a huge number of users asking for this going all the way back to 2008.

I'm sure they have their reasons, but I have mine, too. If it's a question of adding complexity, that ship sailed years ago. Settings is already pretty option-heavy, and one more USEFUL (and much-requested) feature isn't going to tip the scales. 

Before you ask, I did find the option to prevent buttons from adjusting ringer and alarm volumes, but this feels like it's ignoring the underlying issue.

apple,"My Apple Watch literally saved my life twice in the past 2 weeks. Thank you, Apple.","As much negativity is going on in the world lately I figured I would share a personal positive story about my own Apple watch with the sub and how I am very grateful for the folks at Apple and my Apple Watch.

I have written several posts on this sub as well as the watch sub before, and my first post to the watch sub was literally asking the best route to acquire a cheap used watch. A little backstory on this: I was severely injured in Afghanistan several years ago and medically retired from the military. During one of my many healthcare appointments, it was discovered that I had an irregular heartbeat, and with further testing, a hole in my aorta was discovered along with a murmur. I had known for being a fan of Apple the capabilities of the watch and its ability to monitor heart rate and at that moment decided I would acquire one to track my health because the data gained would be invaluable to my doctors as well as my cardiologist. The only issue and main stumbling point was the price. The VA/Military doesn't exactly pay that much in disability pension/retirement thus making me live on a very fixed income. Any extra ""luxury"" expenditures have to be saved up for over the period of several months before they can even become the possibility of reality for me. Luckily some kind Redditors either on this sub or the watch sub directed me to a site called Swappa which sells used electronics. After saving for a few months (and honestly a small loan from a family member once they knew it was for my health) I was able to buy a used S1 watch. It isn't in the best condition, it doesn't really look pretty, it has it issues from time to time, but it's mine and it works for exactly what I need it to work for. The biggest hurdle was cleared. 

Fast forward several months to 2 weeks ago and I am sitting at home watching T.V. preparing to eat dinner. I received an alert that my heart rate was high. I do a check and my resting BPM was at 120. I knew something was off but decided to just wait and see because I figured due to the age of the watch maybe it was a faulty reading. I was wrong. 10 min later I went into cardiac arrest. I was rushed to the hospital and stabilized, diagnosed with a heart attack and due to the watch and related cardio/health apps I was able to share a wealth of info with all the doctors and specialists from beginning to end of the entire cardio incident. 

I was released and 6 days later I was sitting at home recovering from the first incident intentionally avoiding all forms of stress or exertion. As I was laying on the floor reading a book I began to feel a slight tightness in my chest. I manually decided to check my heart rate.  It was at this point I noticed that my resting BPM was hovering around the 87-98 ish point and only elevating. I decided as a preventative measure due to the last episode to jump in my car, throw on the 4 way emergency lights and floor the gas all the way to the hospital. I informed them what was going on and just as I was being led to the back of the ER and hooked up to the EKG I was hit again. This time I was rushed by ambulance to a next level critical care facility in the next major city and held there for 48 hours where a laundry list of tests were conducted on me. Had it not been for my watch and my vigilance after the last incident; that day could have ended a whole lot worse I was informed by the doctors at the hospital. 

Sadly this story doesn't have a happy ending as of yet. They have no idea what is causing the cardiac incidents. The only thing they can tell me is that it's not normal for a 36 year old man to be having repeated heart attacks, and they can't assure me if it will even happen again or if it is over. I haven't been given a solid diagnosis but instead about 7 ""good guesses"" that need further workup. 

I've been spending my days trying my best to recuperate after all of this and gain my strength back. I just wanted to share this story with the sub and give my sincere thanks to Apple. I do apologize ahead of time if there are many spelling or grammar mistakes, but I have had to already retype this comment 14 times as my PC kept crashing as I was writing and I had to restart it. (it's 5 years old and crap; it is what it is) I just don't really have the time, nor energy to keep going through and re-editing and spellchecking everything every single time I type it. It's been hard enough on me to get this far sadly. I just most of all wanted to share with this awesome sub and get my deepest heartfelt thank you out there. 




Edit: Since I seem to have several reoccurring questions or things people ask about I decided to address them here at the bottom and hopefully make it easier than looking through the comments for the answers. Also, Thank you everyone for all the kind words, best wishes, and thoughts you have sent to me both here and via PM. It really does mean the world to me. It's nice to wake up after 12 hrs and see so many new comments with everyone having positive things to say. 

1) The Apps I use: 

Cardiogram, Heartwatch, Activity ++ and all are tied together and monitored with the stock Health app. Side note: in Cardiogram, you can be part of the M-Rythum study which is conducted by a university that tracks your heart rate and sends all the data to them. It is to be used in a study to find cures and treatments for heart conditions. Also, if you join it shows how you compare data wise to everyone else in the study. 

2) ""Flooring it to the ER""

This seems to be the one that ruffled the most feathers and honestly if you are stuck on this; you entirely missed the point of the story altogether. I gave a basic gist at the time due to the fact I didn't feel I had to explain myself. Well, now I'm going to further explain so everyone understands. I live in a very remote part of Appalachia. All our Firefighters, EMS, and Ambulance services are a volunteer. Until 5 years ago I literally had an ambulance/EMS service 1.5 min from my door. It went bankrupt and shuttered its doors and hasn't reopened. Now the closest is 1 hour away. The local hospital is exactly 8 miles. 
If I called 911 for an ambulance/EMS this means I have to wait an hour for the ambulance, the time for them to stabilize me, and then the 8-mile drive to the local hospital. 
I understand what I did wasn't ideal in any situation, however, it is what it is. Knowing full well that I have thousands of hours of drivers training in all kinds of conditions via the military, training to drive at high speeds (stationed in Europe 13 years driving on Autobahn) and I was on the phone with 911 the entire time I decided to make the drive myself.  When I left my house I wasn't in any kind of immediate medical emergency. My heart rate was only slightly elevated and climbing. Just due to the previous incident I knew where it was headed. It was 0300 and I passed nobody on the road driving through country roads. The only person put in ""harm's way"" by my driving was literally myself. If I would have started to feel anything serious coming on I would have just had to pull over, stop, and die in my car. If I would have waited the hour for the ambulance/EMS as I stated in the story above; they would have found me dead in my house anyhow. What I did literally save my own life and I will never apologize for it and given the same situation I would do it again as it was the best course of action. 
Folks, everyone doesn't have the same access to medical treatment as you do. Especially individuals in VERY RURAL areas. Please think before you judge. This is all I ask, and the last I will be saying about this matter. I considered removing this whole part of the story, but to do so would be the equivalent of lying and totally disingenuous of me. Therefore it is staying. 

3) Emailing Mr. Cook

Several folks have sent me the email address of Mr. Cook and I copied, pasted, and cleaned up for clarity the story and sent it to him this morning. Hopefully, he is able to get it and understand it. Thankfully Gmail saves! My PC literally crapped out on me 5 times writing the email so I just finally gave up and decided to go the copy and paste route. Thank you to everyone who sent me the email address. 

4) To the folks who PM'ed me wanting to send me a Watch or Computer. 

I am more than humbled by this gesture. However; I could never accept as I haven't done anything to deserve either, and the point of the story wasn't to beg or imply I needed new equipment. I'm so very thankful though that there are honest people like you out there and it has restored my faith in the true goodness of humanity somewhat. If anyone would truly like to do something nice for me; please instead consider donating to a charity of your choice or doing a random act of kindness to brighten someone else's day as much as you have brightened mine. 

5) To those from the Apple stores wanting to share my story in house at meetings. 

Please feel free to do so without any restrictions. 

6) To any media outlet that has contacted me via PM wanting to conduct an interview or ask further questions. 

At this time I am going to humbly decline. I must focus on my health and recovery. I am currently fairly weak, tired, and sleeping around 12 hours a day in between Dr and specialist appointments. I hope you can understand and respect this. I do appreciate your interest in my story though.",141,676,2017-09-08,AAPL,0.05323134921491146,0.9146162271499634,0.03215240780264139

I'm sure we both looked confused and agreed to hang up.  My wife hasn't even tried to call me.

In my log I see that I received the call from my wife.  When I call back I get my wife.  When she calls me she reaches me (as I would expect).

apple,"Just remember, Apple didn't create the hype","Just wanted to throw out a friendly reminder. There is absolutely no way Apple is going to be able to live up to the hype that has been created over the last 2 years of rumors for this new iPhone. 

The important thing to remember is that they hype didn't come from Apple. Apple hasn't made any promises. If the phone has TouchID and no FaceID, it's not Apple's fault that we are expecting that. If the phone has a 2 inch bezel on the top and bottom and a 6 inch bezel on each side, just remember that Apple didn't hype a bezel-less phone. 

No matter what they announce, some leaks will be true and many won't. The ones that you were excited about that don't come true aren't Apple's fault. 

Just try to enjoy the moment and give the device a chance before you slam it. Like, put your hands on it before you declare it to be unholdable. Use FaceID before you declare it to be stupid. Give the new power button a chance before you declare it too large. 

Then, once we get our hands on them, we can tell everyone how stupid they are and how backwards Apple is and how Steve Jobs would never let a product like that ship.

apple,How to turn off iPhone X and more - a reply from Craig Federighi,"It seems that Craig Federighi is really replying to customer emails which is fantastic! 

So given the fact that in the new iPhone X holding down side button triggers Siri, I wondered how to turn off the phone. The second thing that many people wondered was how often will you accidentally close an app instead of scrolling down. And who's more qualified to answer than Craig himself! :)

Here's what Craig wrote (screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/W8QHd)):
&gt; Hi Cezary,
&gt;
&gt;&gt;	1) How do you turn off the new iPhone given the fact that holding down the side button now triggers Siri?
&gt;
&gt;You can either hold down both left and right side buttons for a few seconds, or use a new Shutdown option in Settings -&gt; General.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;	2) Since you‚Äôve been using iPhone X for a while now - how often do you accidentally swipe to exit an app instead of scrolling down?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So far, not a single time.  (The reach to the bottom edge of the &gt;phone is a quite distinct gesture for me).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; craig

apple,Anybody else tired of upgrading and just gonna try holding onto their shit for awhile?,"I've been terrible about all this. Every time a new apple keynote comes out, I'm just ready to buy whatever they're about to put for sale just because I've always had a love for technology and enjoy using new stuff. 

And i want to get the iPhone x at some point, but right now I'm just sitting here thinking...would the experience in my daily life really be ALL that different? Sure the new screen is a bit better and there's some little improvements here and there, but I don't even use my current phone to its max capability. Why did i even upgrade last year when all i do is Facebook, YouTube and text? The more i think about it the more it just feels like a gigantic waste of money for almost no return in improvement of my daily life.  We are at a point of diminishing returns. There's nothing wrong with my 7 plus that would make me feel the need to upgrade and I've been really jealous of people that can just keep the same phone for years and years and still be happy about it. And asking myself ""why cant i do that?""

I'm gonna try to hold out as long as i can and see how long i can make my current phone last. If i could make it all the way to the point where apple stops supporting my phone and THEN upgrade, I'd be so proud of myself.

apple,Apple Music is nowhere near Spotify,"I know that posts like this are usually not appreciated but I just wanted to hear other opinions. I personally think that Spotify is soo much better than Apple Music for so many reasons. I've been using AM for a very long time, in fact I've been using it since it launched, but because I had some issues with my debit card, I couldn't access it and so I decided to switch to Spotify instead (I can't live without music). Just to mention a few reasons why I think that Spotify is better:
‚Ä¢Better suggestions (I discovered so many new good songs after a week of using it!)
‚Ä¢Better interface (you can download all songs in your library at once goddamn it!!!)
‚Ä¢Wi-Fi device switching/integration is soooo good. It's like AM+Remote. I don't even have to unlock/ wake up my iPhone to increase the song volume on my macbook. It's so good 
‚Ä¢You can rate songs from lock screen which is super useful
‚Ä¢Also there's a very interesting option to see concerts near me which I really like
‚Ä¢Better playlists

Apple's [iOS 11 website](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-11/)

The build number is the same as the Golden Master candidate of iOS 11. 

In addition, Apple has ""released"" the [iPhone 10,4](https://twitter.com/iOSReleases/status/910188368704745472) and the [iPhone 10,1](https://twitter.com/iOSReleases/status/910188364913156098). 

Useful comment from _theoneandonly:

&gt; To everyone who just updated saying their iPhone is hot, or slow, or laggy:

&gt; This happens every year. For the first few hours (or in some cases as much as a day), your iPhone is reindexing spotlight, running scripts, and doing a lot of under the hood optimizations.

&gt; If it‚Äôs slow or laggy or hot during the first few hours, don‚Äôt let that bother you. It‚Äôs trying to catch up on a lot of processes. Give it some time before you judge it. It‚Äôs even saving some of the most demanding processes until you‚Äôve plugged the phone into the wall for a few hours.

&gt; If it‚Äôs still bad this time tomorrow, then feel free to complain.

apple,"""The crazy ones"" hidden easter egg","I don't know if this is widely known, but going through my display resolution settings I noticed that the text displayed on the different icons of the Scale options are actually the transcript from the 1997 ad from the ""Think Different"" campaign. I recently read that they also used this for the TextEdit icon in a previous version of MacOS. In my opinion it is one of the best ad campaigns Apple has ever done (I like the Steve Jobs narrated version the best), so it's quite cool to see them using it as part of their current tech.

apple,The end of an era,"I woke up this morning and picked up my phone and realized the WiFi was off so I kind of shrugged and checked the news.  I walked downstairs and found my AirPort Extreme router was off.  I power cycled it and nothing happened.  I heard some whining from the power supply but that was it.  The thing was done.  After ~10 years my router had died.  I remember driving to the Alaska MacStore in the snow in early 2007 to buy it and being giddy that I was about to spend that kind of money on a router.  It outlived multiple generations of PlayStations, three computers, and probably every single piece of electronic equipment I had at that time.  I had it for literally a third of my life.

In the end I bought a new router to replace it but I couldn't let it go out without a eulogy.  It was an omnipresent part of my life and has been on my mind all day.  It's weird how inanimate objects can feel sometimes.

apple,A review for the rest of us: iPhone 8 vs iPhone 6s cameras,"I'm writing as a ""regular"" person who upgrades their phone every two years. The 's' year as it is (was) known has taken me through some great phones, 3GS -&gt; 4S -&gt; 5s -&gt; 6s and now... 8. I'll forgive Apple for ruining the pattern because it's a solid upgrade. But as a regular person the camera is the most important ‚Äúwas it worth it"" factor. So, was it?


**Daylight**

[iPhone 8](https://imgur.com/RMm3W9a) vs [iPhone 6s](https://imgur.com/TYUvA3T) This cloud filled sky is rendered well by both phones but the 8 has better dynamic range. Colour is a little more accurate too.

[iPhone 8](https://imgur.com/a/8DtQC) vs [iPhone 6s](https://imgur.com/a/nriNU) Wow! Look at the reds.

[iPhone 8](https://imgur.com/a/qSz6g) vs [iPhone 6s](https://imgur.com/a/o4bZm) The 8 is picking up amazing details in the wood grain.

[iPhone 8](https://imgur.com/a/NRUTo) vs [iPhone 6s](https://imgur.com/a/aIVWQ) Marginally more accurate colour from the 8.



**Low-light**

[iPhone 8](https://imgur.com/qZKK6JF) vs [iPhone 6s](https://imgur.com/8BZ1cAF) The iPhone 8 show less noise but lacks sharpness too. The 6s‚Äô colour reproduction of this Space Grey MBP is much better.

[iPhone 8](https://imgur.com/a/Yuzmt) vs [iPhone 6s](https://imgur.com/a/JC4Xn) The noise on the 6s is noticeably worse. At first glance it looks like the 8 is compromising details for less noise, but on closer inspection you can see eyelashes on the iPhone 8‚Äôs photo!


**Video**

Personally I love 60fps for home video, and the 6s (and 7) could only manage 1080p at that frame rate. The 8 blows them out of the water with 4K video at 60fps.

Here‚Äôs a really quick pan of both 60fps modes. Not much to say, 4K has more detail, and the 8 has slightly more accurate colour.

apple,The iPad opened the powerful world of technology to older generations. This is a testament to why Apple is so great.,"We forget that Apple really reaches a very broad older generation. Just because they're not here on Reddit or some other website posting doesn't mean they don't exist. We must not forget that.

Honestly, give someone 60+ years old an iPad. Hell, even 80+ years old and they will be able to use it. It's so intuitively accessible.

Not only that but Apple strived to make the device *light*, *thin* and *easy to hold*. Old people with achy hands and not so nimble reflexes appreciate being able to use a device that doesn't tire them out.

My (94 year old) grandpa loves taking pictures with his iPad. Yeah, to a lot it's silly. Yeah, it doesn't take over the top awesome images. But it takes good enough images where he can sit back, enjoy the pictures he took, and is proud and happy to share them with me, my dad and my other cousins and we get it. It's not pictures going up on a fancy blog, or in some artist(s) portfolio. It's just a means of communication and excitement.

Same with my dad (68 years old). He is able to FaceTime with me and communicate. I appreciate being able to do this... I remember trying something similar with my dad long ago, before FaceTime existed and it was a pain in the butt.

Not sure, but I feel we take this moment and time for granted. There's so much amazing tech in what Apple does. It gets poo-poo'd, people aren't happy, etc.

apple,"iPad Pro 10.5"" is a profound piece of technology for students","Hi there,

I'm a junior studying aerospace engineering who picked up an iPad Pro 10.5"" and the accompanying Pencil. I just wanted to post here and encourage anyone on the fence about ditching paper notebooks that the grass is much greener on the other side. 

Here's a great example: My professor said we were allowed a front-and-back crib sheet for our exam, which is pretty common. This is something I would usually write out and have to erase a ton before I get to a good final version. With this iPad and GoodNotes 4, I can move text around, easily resize sections, draw nice straight dividing lines. The result is a much cleaner, much more usable crib sheet. The result is seen here:

Apparently they bought them at Walmart. They still have the itunes cards and walmart receipt. 


EDIT: This looks promising: ""Contact Apple

If you have additional questions, or if you've been a victim of a scam involving iTunes Gift Cards, you can call Apple at 800-275-2273 (U.S.) or contact Apple Support online.""

They seem to know it happens, so hopefully someone more knowledgeable can post about their policies when it comes to this.

apple,Visualizing the Size Difference between the 8/8+/X,"I've seen a lot of discussion about the screen real estate versus one hand/two hand use of the new phones. 

I'm a very visual person, and so it helps me to visualize what exactly that difference looks like in a simple way, and so I just put together a quick chart that helped me that I wanted to share with this community as well in case anyone might find it helpful.

You'll find comparisons for every possible combination of two phones out of those three models, both for overall phone and for the screen. It's interesting to see how close the X screen really comes to the 8+ screen in size.
