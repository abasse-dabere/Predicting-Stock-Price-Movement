apple,"PSA: If you redeemed an iTunes digital copy code from a Blu-Ray, but only see HD resolution for a movie that’s available in 4K resolution on your iTunes account, the ONLY way to get 4K resolution is to repurchase the movie by “gifting” it to yourself.","We all know, if you purchased a movie on iTunes in HD, Apple will give you a free upgrade from HD to 4K resolution when and if it becomes available.  They’ve said this at press conferences.  I’ve seen it first-hand in my iTunes account.

However, please know that you will NOT necessarily receive a 4K upgrade from HD for movies you redeemed on iTunes (or MoviesAnywhere) from a digital copy code you got with a blu-ray.

For example, I noticed this most recently with Wes Anderson’s “Isle of Dogs,” which I purchased on blu-ray.  This movie is not available in Ultra HD blu-ray in the U.S., only 1080p HD blu-ray... However, it IS available on iTunes in 4K UHD.

I redeemed the digital code that came with my blu-ray disc on MoviesAnywhere, which gave me access to the iTunes version.  I noticed afterwards, however, that on the iTunes Store I did not get the 4K UHD version, but rather it said I only had an HD version.

OK, no problem, I’ll pay an upgrade fee to turn my HD only version into a 4K version.

The problem is, you can’t upgrade to 4K.  And there’s no obvious way to repurchase the movie on your existing iTunes account from scratch.

I found later that this applied to not only “Isle of Dogs,” but older movies as well (whose codes I redeemed long before MoviesAnywhere existed) like “Lawrence of Arabia.”  It also seems to be on a case-by-case basis, since some movies whose codes I have redeemed, I have gotten a free upgrade to 4K.  It’s entirely arbitrary, and most likely subject to agreements with the film studios.

And it’s stupid.

Well, after talking to four different Apple Support representatives, we found a solution.

If you already have a movie associated with your iTunes account, but you only have access to the HD version and not the 4K version in iTunes, repurchase the movie by “Gifting” it to yourself.  When you redeem the “gift,” you essentially repurchase the movie, and you’ll get the 4K version in the process.

Not an elegant solution, but it does work.  I hope this helps.",30,283,2018-08-02,AAPL,0.052557848393917084,0.9196071624755859,0.027834974229335785

apple,Airpods. The gateway drug to Apple.,"I had a 3. My first smartphone in 2010 (when smart was a necessary prefix to define a phone, now it's just phone, again thanks Mr Jobs). Since 2012, I've been Android on mobile, and since 1995 I've used windows on desktop/laptop.

But. I've been searching for the perfect wireless headphones for a long time. Bought a few and hated them. Did some video watching. Found out airpods work with Android. Vacillated. Eventually I decided I'd try them. Happened to pass an Apple store in TST Hong Kong. Not a big store. Went in. Told the assistant I was interested in airpods and at that point I was transported back into the seamless, perfect, customer centric universe Jobs created, and I was blown away. Apple does so very many things orders of magnitude better than others. It was a joy to experience spending hkd1299 and for the four weeks I've owned them, the airpods have been used so much. Their user-centric design is incredible. Despite me using an Android phone, they are incredible and easy to use.

I'm tempted back. I hate the lock-ins, but the customer service and awesome user design is enticing.

Thanks for a great product, you trillion dollar bastard.",476,1728,2018-08-04,AAPL,0.02525453083217144,0.9095520973205566,0.06519342213869095

apple,"Genius Bar: ""Stripped iPhone X Screw"" = New Phone for $29","Thought this might be an interesting story to tell, since Apple has been (rightfully so) been getting a bad rap with iMac Pro repairs lately.

I had recently dropped my phone and shattered the screen. I have AppleCare+, so it would be $29 to replace the screen damage. I made an appointment for last night, and even though the store was listed as same-day repair, the rep in the store told me that they weren't doing any more repairs for the day (two hours before closing). As such, they'd have to keep the phone overnight. Annoying, sure. But not the end of the world so I let them keep it.

Anyways, I walk into the store and another rep approaches me explaining that the pentalobe screws were stripped during attempted repair. While opening a new iPhone X from a box, they told me that for $29 (the same price as the screen repair), they were going to give me a new phone. I'm not sure if they'd be offering this same service had I not had AppleCare+, but either way, I'm really impressed. Are stipping the screws during repair a common occurrence? I've repaired plenty of iPhones in the past and the screws never appeared to be weak or strip easily.",128,401,2018-08-04,AAPL,0.08988333493471146,0.8599982857704163,0.050118401646614075

apple,Opinion: iCloud.com is due a usability and feature update,"I store everything on my iCloud account. This includes all my work, photos, documents from apps and all my emails. I’m also subscribed to the 50GB iCloud Drive plan, because I’m storing nearly 30GB worth of stuff. However, I do not own a Mac computer.

When I want to access my documents on my iPhone, it works flawlessly; everything opens quickly and it’s very easy to find my files.
When I want to access my documents on **my own** Windows PC at home, it works just fine due to the iCloud for Windows application. This application isn’t brilliant, but it does get the job done. 

The problem arises when I need to access my documents on a computer away from home. The iCloud website is, to be blunt, awful. 
The login process is really slow, partially due to 2FA but also because Apple has definitely prioritised looks over power here. On an older computer, one with an older Pentium or Celeron for example, the website is so laggy that I stop trying to use it. When in iCloud Drive, every folder takes a good 3-4 seconds to load, which is awful when you actually want to stay organised.

Okay okay, so performance isn’t great, whatever. But surely Apple has given us some great features at the cost of speed, right?

***Wrong***

iCloud.com’s Drive component offers a paltry feature set in comparison to Google’s popular alternative. Want to download/upload a folder? **No.** Want to create a new Pages, Keynote, or Numbers document? **Not happening.** Maybe you want to share a document with someone else for real-time collaboration? **Can’t do that from Drive.** But the worst thing of all, is you *can’t right click from anywhere in iCloud Drive to perform other actions.* I have no idea why Apple hasn’t done this yet; Google has implemented a right click fantastically, and allows for things like search, move to another folder (that’s right, iCloud Drive doesn’t have a ‘move’ feature on iCloud.com) and to even change the colour of a folder. iCloud.com’s feature set is straight up bad.

Sorry for this rant, but Apple needs to give us more on this website. Yes, I know they want us to buy Macs, but when Google, Microsoft, etc provide great alternatives, they need to up their game to stay with the pack. I'm thinking of moving my files and photos over to Google, where I get 3x the free storage that Apple gives (15GB vs 5GB), and so I have a better experience on Windows.

If you're awesome and already have Pro there's an optional ""Tip Jar"" in the Settings tab where you can leave an extra tip, and 100% of that is going to the shelters too!

Obligatory picture of the one I adopted (her name is Ruby): https://i.imgur.com/6qVtDgu.jpg

So… yeah! Would love your support toward a great cause if you can spare it! I'll post how much we raised tomorrow as well as a proof of donation! 

Let me know if you have any questions and my kitty thanks you.

iphone,I built that Apollo Reddit app and our local animal shelter is over run with kittens and running low on food so I'm donating 100% of proceeds from Apollo today to them if you're interested at all in Apollo!,"Hey! I'm that fella who built that [Apollo reddit app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) that some of y'all use!

Our local animal shelter (SPCA, similar to ASPCA in the states but Canadian) [is overflowing with kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/94vbs9/ns_spca_says_rooms_are_overflowing_with_kittens/) thanks to kitten season (warm weather means kittens breed a lot) and running low on food so I wanted to make a donation but figured the Apple/Reddit community is a great generous bunch so I wanted to use that to maybe raise some more money for the shelter, so 100% of Apollo's proceeds today are going to the shelter to get them food and supplies!

So if you've been interested in Apollo at all (free download) and held off on getting Apollo Pro (costs a few bucks) today's a great opportunity to do so and help out some kitties and puppies! I got my little one from there this time last year ([her name is Ruby](https://i.imgur.com/aHKZv2E.jpg)) and she's a delight so I can personally attest that they're an awesome bunch.

So yeah! Your support would be greatly appreciated, (or you can [donate directly](https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298) or even just donate to your local shelter it all helps!).

If you already have Pro there's a ""Tip Jar"" in the Settings tab where you can donate further too, and I'll donate 100% of that too!

I'll post how much we raised and proof of donation tomorrow!

apple,"So... Apollo made $5,087.23 yesterday. Yeah no joke. Just sent it to the local animal shelter. THANK YOU SO MUCH! (Animal pics inside)","Yeah that was one hell of a way to wake up.

Long story short yesterday [I made a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/953nqz/i_built_the_apollo_reddit_client_and_im_donating/) saying I'll donate all the proceeds from my [Apollo Reddit app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) for the day to our local SPCA animal shelter (an awesome Canadian non-profit, no-kill shelter) because they said they were really low on supplies and well cats and dogs are awesome and need our help. I wanted to make a donation but I figured the awesome Apple/Reddit community might want to get in on that and give them something for it in the process so I made a post about it and sweet mayonnaise did you guys ever.

$5,087.23 is the total amount raised. Yeah seriously I'm not joking, I wanted to raise like a few hundred bucks but 5 freaking grand is just absurdly beyond what I thought. All the amounts below are in Canadian dollars at today's exchange rate because most things came in in US dollars and it's a Canadian charity.

### Breakdown

- $4,038.55 in proceeds from Apollo sales. 
- $500 ($653.16 CAD) approximately from a ton of [direct donations](https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298), hard to keep track but going off of a general tally from the comments and PMs I received I can honestly say I think that's undershooting the amount donated directly if anything 
- $50 worth of bitcoin donated ($65.31 CAD)
- $25 from a kind friend
- Someone awesomely gave me Reddit gold so I'll donate that too ($5.21 CAD)

That brings the total to approximately $4,787.23 but I really wanted that over $5,000 (plus there's some still some people commenting here and there about donating through Apollo even though the day's over and I want their money to count) I'll throw in another $300 of my own for a clean total of $5,087.23.

### Proof

As I stated around $500 ($653.16 CAD) of that total was donated directly to the charity (not through Apollo) from some amazing people so they already have those funds awesomely, so the amount remaining is $5,087.23 - $653.16 which is $4,434.07.

I wanted to try to figure out the best way to donate that, so I [posted asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/95c0cs/if_i_theoretically_had_about_5000_to_donate_to/) and then called their fundraising line to make sure and they said it would be best to donate it directly, which makes a lot of sense.

Of course it would have been cool to throw open the doors of the shelter with $5,000 worth of pet food and music playing but the goal is the animals (and not to be flashy) and fact is they can do a lot more with that money directly than through one of us buying stuff (bulk supply discounts, they can put it exactly where needed, etc.) so I donated it directly per their advice and now they can do the best possible things with it to help out the kitties and puppies and turtles and rabbits and whatnot of Nova Scotia. :)

### Thank You

Seriously everyone thank you so much. It honestly blew me away, I was hoping for a small something but I really think this is going to make a massive difference to a lot of needy animals, y'all are the best. And if anyone missed the chance yesterday and still want to you can donate directly to them here: https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298 Or even just to your local shelter, they surely need the help as well! My two little furballs thank you too.

Definitely won't be the last time I do this with Apollo, I'll try to do something like this again someday since it went so well. :D Anyway, back to work (and obligatory if you wanna check out a cool Reddit app check out [Apollo](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575)!)

apple,Getting replacement AirPods - My wonderful experience.,"I got my AirPods in April. They started off as an amazing product. They would sync to my phone instantly, and the battery life was great. In the past month, my AirPods had started to have two big issues. The first is that they stopped connecting to my iPhone. They would connect about once every ten tries. The second issue is that may Airpods would not always charge when they were in the charging case. After about a month of dealing with this, I decided to contact Apple support. I contacted them yesterday morning, and within a few minutes, I had an appointment for this afternoon. Today I went to the Apple store at 4:00. I checked in with one of the employees, and they asked me to sit down at a table. A minute later, another Apple store employee came out and started to help me. He was very understanding and asked to me re-create the problems. He told me that because my AirPods were under warranty, and that because he could not discern whether the charging case or the individual earbuds were causing the issues, that I would get a brand new pair of AirPods, charging case and all, for free. He went to get them from the back of the store, came back 5 minutes later, and gave them to me. I walked out of the Apple store at 4:15. It literally only took 15 minutes to get them replaced. It is absolutely amazing how well Apple takes care of their consumers. This is whole experience has really shown me how much better Apple is as a company compared to some of the other technology companies that are out there. IMO, Apple's customer service and support is unrivaled.",87,193,2018-08-09,AAPL,0.0738924890756607,0.859682023525238,0.06642544269561768

Anyways, one thing that fascinates me is the home button, or rather, the lack of one. I've always been a fan of home buttons, and the fact that apple removed them gave me even more reason to not buy their phones. But I've felt how well they've done the vibration thing, and found it really cool.

apple,I built OLEDify - takes advantage of the iPhone X OLED screen and saves battery by pure-blacking your wallpaper,"Sub rules say self-promotion is allowed on Saturday so I thought you guys might find this useful.

I built this app from feedback from the /r/AmoledBackgrounds sub.

**OLEDify** converts regular dark wallpapers into Pure Black wallpapers (#000000 - pixel is off). Since the pure black pixels are off, it [helps reduce battery use on the newer phones with OLED and AMOLED screens](https://www.greenbot.com/article/2834583/how-much-power-does-a-black-interface-really-save-on-amoled-displays.html). For iOS, iPhone X is the first phone with OLED screen. Even if your iPhone doesn't have an OLED screen, I find pure black wallpapers looks super crisp and nice!

Here's the link:

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oledify-pure-black-wallpapers/id1416984528?ls=1&amp;mt=8

**Here's an example before and after:**

Before (Artist credit: Nychos the Weird): 

Notice the dark grey background in the image which still keeps the pixels on and uses battery.

https://i.redd.it/w098c8sefpa11.jpg

After (Background is pure black and also resized for the phone screen): 

https://w.oledify.com/946E9804-842D-4B8A-AA35-C8C54A1B25DD_pureblack_75point1_resolution_750x1334.png

Also notice the image name in the link ends with the % of true black (75point1) and the resolution (750x1334).

**Demo video and screenshots:**

https://streamable.com/fhtgx

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/br5kdflkniwt9u0/AADkRawLrLR3isiEs5AMwjMua?dl=0

- The **“Crop &amp; Resize”** tool in the app can be used to resize &amp; fit wallpapers for your screen. This is useful when you have an image which doesn't perfectly fit your screen as it helps you create a new image of the suitable size for your screen size. Got this idea from the comments on ""Can someone resize this for XXX device""

- The app also contains a **""Post to Reddit""** option which posts the edited wallpaper directly to the /r/AmoledBackgrounds sub. It has the ""sub rules"" in place already - the title contains the resolution [1024x750], the wallpaper must be 40% true black. One ""cool"" thing I think the app has is that the wallpaper gets uploaded to my Amazon S3 server and the link is directly to my domain w.oledify.com. So the wallpaper shared in the link to AmoledBackgrounds doesn't suffer from compression issues which imgur uploads do (causes pure black pixels to no longer be pure black sometimes).

- As you drag the sliders, the updates to the image happen in realtime and quite fast. Had to utilize the GPU instead of CPU for this to work and it took forever but I am glad it worked out well and gives a better user experience.

- I have tested the app on 5 iPhone X so far, on my personal 6S and on the simulator. The app has been tested by a few members from the /r/AmoledBackgrounds sub.

- The app is 100% free to use and has no ads. I noticed a few people requested a donate/tipping on the AmoledBackgrounds subreddit post, so there is a Tip Jar option but it's not required to unlock any features. Everything is 100% free in the app.

I would also like to thank all the beta testers from the /r/AmoledBackgrounds community who helped bring this app to where it is now. I really appreciate the feedback! Overall, the testers think the app is quite useful but I am open to any additional feedback and criticism to make it even better! Also if anyone has any questions regarding the app or the development process, feel free to ask!

**EDIT:** Regarding the savings in battery life: I often use my phone mostly for looking at the bus time widget. So the wallpaper and the wallpaper background on the widget screen does make a difference. Also a lot of people frequently hit the power button just to see the notification they just received. So that also saves a bit of battery if the pixels are off (admittedly small but still).

Note that the app can be used not just for oledifying wallpapers - you can edit wallpapers on it too and crop/resize them for your different screen sizes etc. The main reason I built this was for the crisp true blacks and then from the research, I found it might make a small difference in battery life too so that was a cherry on top.",91,771,2018-08-11,AAPL,0.040770262479782104,0.920982301235199,0.038247447460889816
AppleWatch,Apple Watch has officially cemented its place in my life,"I haven’t had my Watch for long. Maybe a month at this point. It’s a Series 3 space gray aluminum that I bought off Craigslist. 

My family was set to leave for our annual beach vacation last Sunday. The day before that, Saturday, I went to my friend’s apartment that night and we were doing normal college age kid things. I passed out asleep around 2am and set my alarm to wake up at 10:00 the next morning to go home and get my stuff together to leave. 

I was woken up around 8am by my watch buzzing on my wrist from a phone call. I answered, and it was my dad telling me to come to the nursing home where my grandma lived because she was in critical condition (she had been fine the night before) and it was guaranteed she didn’t have much longer. I sped over there and not 10 minutes after I arrived, my grandma passed, surrounded by her entire family (at least, the ones who live in the area, which is basically the entire immediate family).

Without my watch waking me up, I would have missed this and been the only family member not there with her when she went. I was sound asleep, my phone was on silent, and if I didn’t have the watch on I would have snoozed until 10 like I had planned. I know this is just a basic function of the watch but on that day it performed a very meaningful function for me.",30,482,2018-08-11,AAPL,0.04411837086081505,0.9291641116142273,0.026717504486441612

iphone,Fun Story about Recovering a Stolen iPhone,"A few years ago I was working at a phone store. I owned an iPhone 4s at the time, and had set my phone on the my desk/counter. The customer I was helping (let's call them Customer #1) wanted a new phone with service, so I went into the back to retrieve Customer #1's new phone and when I got back to the counter they had left. That wasn't a problem, I've had people leave without explanation before, I wasn't worried.

The next customer in line (Customer #2) asked a question about a feature on the iPhone, so I went to reach for my phone and realized it was gone. I started looking on, below, and behind the counter, and couldn't find it. Customer #2 was a frequent customer, and they told me to take my time. I called my iPhone from the store phone and couldn't hear it. Customer #2 was fascinated, he said he thought he saw Customer #1 reach over the counter and take it.

This was when I decided to log into iCloud and to ring it and see where it is. So I logged in, and saw the phone ping half way across the city. Customer #1 had taken it and was running. When I saw that he was running I immediately made sure the phone had a lock on it, and called it. He turned it off. I sent a message to it via iCloud saying ""I know you stole my phone, please return it to the store and I won't press charges"" so that when he turned it on again it would be the first thing that he would see. I got an email that he turned it on again at about 10 pm that night at an apartment complex. The cop that I had been talking to told me that unless there was only a single house in a 30-foot radius that they wouldn't be able to enter the residence. I was screwed.

They turned the phone off really fast when they saw the message that night. The next morning, I saw that they had turned the phone on again at the same location, so I assumed that Customer #1 lived there. The next message I sent was a little more specific, I sent something along the lines of ""Hi, This is your address XXX, I will send the police to your residence by this afternoon unless I get the phone back. Please bring the phone back to the store and I won't press charges.""

When Customer #1 saw this message I knew they panicked because they immediately turned the phone off and a few minutes later the phone pinged in an empty field about a mile away from their house and then turned off again. I thought my phone was toast. I went to the field that morning before work to see if I could find the phone. There was nothing. I left for work after looking around for a few minutes. When I got to work I noticed that there was a plastic bag by the front door. Could it be?

I went and grabbed the bag and lo and behold there was my phone inside it! It was very dusty, which I assumed was was from Customer #1 throwing the phone into the field, then realizing that I still had their address, and returned the phone to the store.  iCloud and findmyiphone saved me hundreds of dollars that day.

Edit:  TL;DR: My iPhone was stolen off the front counter at work and I traced it to the thief's home address and told him via my phone that I knew his address. He put the phone in a bag and left it outside my work the next day.",140,833,2018-08-14,AAPL,0.0908123031258583,0.8815454244613647,0.027642272412776947

apple,"Slide for Reddit, the beloved open-source Reddit browser for Android, is finally available on the App Store! Slide has been built from the ground up for iOS as a beautiful, feature-packed, ad-free experience by the community, for the community","#EDIT: Apple's IAP servers are back online! If you were crashing trying to purchase pro or access pro features, you should be able to use these features again

Good morning r/apple!

After years of development and months of testing from thousands of Redditors, Slide for Reddit is now available for all to download (for free) on the App Store!

Slide began as a simple open-source coding project for me during high school, and quickly gained popularity on Android in part because of its beautiful design, extensive feature set, and the fact that it was totally ad-free. Soon after release, I began getting requests from users to make a version for their iOS devices, and after a few years of solidifying Slide's feature set and UI, I began work on porting Slide into a native Swift application, keeping with the open source and free essence that made Slide so awesome on Android.  

It's been an amazing ride, and I can't believe that we're finally here :)

**TL;DR:** [**Promo images**](https://imgur.com/a/f9kGbHl) **and [App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slide-for-reddit/id1260626828). Join our awesome community over at r/slide_ios**

# Most Reddit apps have similar features, what makes Slide unique? 

For starters, Slide is totally ad and analytic tracker-free, and is open source under an Apache2 license on [GitHub](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios)! Slide has an amazing community of contributing developers on both Android and iOS, and part of what makes Slide so awesome is that, not only does the community help shape its features, but it helps develop them as well.  


Along with this, Slide has a very unique and customizable UI and app flow that has been streamlined over years of feedback on Android, but built completely natively with a comfortable Apple feel. This design also offers thousands of theme combinations and per-subreddit theming options that lets you customize Slide to your exact tastes. If the promo images do not totally convince you, I would love it if you gave Slide a shot to experience it after setting it up for yourself :)


# A few other notable features

* Slide is totally offline-capable! Set up autocaching to save your favorite subreddits for your morning commute, or continue to browse Reddit even when you are not on the internet
* Data saving mode downloads lower-quality images whenever possible to keep you in control of your data usage
* Slide supports many content types including Imgur albums, Gfycat gifs, XKCD comics, Streamable.com videos, and all Reddit content and features. 
* [Slide looks great on an iPad](https://i.imgur.com/YYDifTi.png)! Make use of that extra screen real estate with multi-column mode
* Skip the posts you don't want to see with Slide's powerful filter system (subreddits, titles, flairs, users, etc), or fine-tune the type of content you see on subreddits with [content filters](https://i.imgur.com/9JztPr7.png)!
* [View tables ](https://i.imgur.com/z0rcQ5O.png)and code blocks inline with the rest of your content
* Complete moderation suite with mod mail and mod log support
* Hundreds of other features you will fall in love with

# How free is it?

Slide will never have ads. Period. Slide also offers all Reddit features for free, and allows you to browse all content types for free. 

That being said, I have been working on Slide as my ~~full time job~~ passion project while attending University, and I have made some features ""pro"" features that offer cosmetic changes and features that enhance the Slide experience. I have worked to make the app completely usable without Pro :)

The unlock is currently on sale for $2.99 with a $4.99 donation option, and is usually $4.99 for the base option. 

# What can we expect in the future? 

After working on apps for the last four years, I can tell you the job is never done. 

Although Slide is feature-complete to its Android counterpart, there is a lot that we want to add! In the pipeline is auto-playing gifs in the main feed, Apple Watch support, and full Multireddit management support. If you have suggestions or feature requests, we are always looking for feedback over at r/slide_ios or on Slide's [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios/issues)! 

# How can I help?

If you have Swift experience and would like to contribute to the Slide project, [the repository](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios) is always accepting pull requests! If you have any questions about the code or how to contribute to a GitHub project, you can always reach me via PM or on our Discord channel (link in the repository Readme).

Otherwise, bug reports and feedback are invaluable to keeping the app going, and you can join our amazing community over at r/slide_ios :)


---

I would like to personally thank all of those who have helped get Slide to where it is today, especially @colejd who has contributed a lot to the Slide project in the last few months. I would also like to thank all of you who volunteered to beta test Slide on TestFlight, your feedback and support have shaped Slide into what it is today.

apple,Not all Apple customer service is great,"I’ve been using Apple devices since the iPhone 3G. One of the reasons I’ve stuck with Apple is because of their customer service - when the mute switch on my 3G broke and Apple swapped it straight away, no questions asked, they won me over.

I’ve had more good experience since then. But my current experience is not so good.

It started last week, when my Apple Watch had no power after being left to charge over night, and nothing I could do would coax it to turn on.

I took it into an Apple Store, and the Genius explained it had to be sent away to the depot, the depot would replace it (they can’t be repaired), and there’s no reason it wouldn’t be covered under warranty. They had me sign a work order, and the work order stated that my watch had only minor cosmetic scratches on it.

Two days later, I get an e-mail saying I owe a repair fee. I opened the e-mail, and it says that the screen is cracked. There are a couple of photos attached to it, and when I clicked on them, they showed a very large crack on the corner of the screen. There’s no way that was there before!

I phoned Apple Care, and the representative was very understanding. He agreed that if the crack had been there when I dropped the watch off, there’s no way the Genius could have missed it and described the watch as having only cosmetic damage. He said he’d investigate and get back to me.

The next day he called back - the Apple Store had accepted responsibility for the damage, and would replace it for feee. Up to this point, I have no problem - accidents happen, and they were quick to own up to and put it right.

But then it started going wrong. The Apple Care representative told me that I needed to click on the link in the e-mail to reject the paid repair and have the item returned to me from the depot. Then, I should take it back to the Apple Store, so they could send it back to the depot and send me a replacement. Yes, you read that right - it needs to from the depot, to me, to the store, then back to the same depot before it can be replaced!

At the same time as the representative was explaining this to me, I got an e-mail from the store asking me to call them. So that’s what I did next. I had not realised that the number doesn’t actually put you through to the store, it connects back to the same Apple Care centre I had just spoken to - so now I spoke to a different representative. He agreed the situation was quite mad, and asked me to hold while he spoke to the store. When he came back to me, he said there was no need to go through this convoluted procedure, I should just go to the store the following day and they’d give me a replacement.

So that’s what I did, last night. I saw a store manager. And the store manager said that I’d wasted my journey, because there was nothing he could do until I had the broken watch in my hand to give to them. He said that once I had the watch returned to me by the depot, I should come back and he’d replace it on the spot - no need for it to go back to the depot again. In other words, what he told me was different to what *both* the Apple Care representatives had told me. It also meant I’d wasted my evening making an unnecessary trip to the store - I’d actually rearranged some other plans I had so that I could get to the store.

So here I am, a week and half after my watch failed to power on, still with no watch, and also with no idea what the process will be to get a replacement, having been told three different things by three different people.

In my experience, this is not typical of Apple, which makes it particularly disappointing. Has anyone else had anything like this happen to them? Anyone got any advice? And if not, thanks for hearing my rant anyway!",93,213,2018-08-15,AAPL,0.15238700807094574,0.815830409526825,0.03178255632519722

apple,What is Siri's favorite color? Let me explain.,"[An Infinite Reflection Turns Green \(Credit: Anthony Jauneaud\/Flickr\)](https://i.redd.it/n4waqfydmhg11.png)

Ask Siri for her favorite color. She'll give you this response: ""My favorite color is... well, it's sort of greenish, but with more dimensions.""

Have you ever stared into an endless reflection between mirrors? Well if you were to stare long enough you'd notice a green hue towards the end of the 'tunnel'. This is due to the iron-oxide used when manufacturing a glass mirror (specifically when made with a 'soda-lime glass' base). Your typical mirror is bound to have imperfections which is why this greenish tint is visible. So combine this tint with an endless reflection... You get a color that is *sort of greenish, but with more dimensions*.

So my conclusion is that Siri's favorite color is the color of a mirror.",35,422,2018-08-16,AAPL,0.02165544405579567,0.9334418773651123,0.044902704656124115

apple,My wild keyboard replacement story.,"I took my 2016 touch bar macbook pro to the apple store last week for the keyboard replacement program. Apparently there was a high volume of repairs, and when they tried to fill out the paper work to send it off, the system wouldn't let them. They called the main apple repair center and were told to do the replacement in store because of the high volume. I dropped off my computer, slightly worried that I was getting a lower quality repair than if they had sent it off. 

I received a call from them 5 days later that the topcase they received had a dent it in, and they had to order the part again. At this point, I was frustrated with the situation since it had taken so long, so I asked if I could be given a complimentary 67W usb-c charger for my troubles. They agreed to that, so I was happy.

Today, I received a call from the apple store, expecting it to be an automated call telling me that my computer was ready to pick up. That was not the case. haha. While it was being repaired, they dropped the computer and the display broke. They told me they could replace the display OR give me a new computer, but the ""problem"" was that they didn't have any 13 inch pros with 16gb of ram like my old one had, so they had to give me a 2018 model 15 inch 6 core 2.2ghz with 256gb of storage. (Poor me, I know. lol). I believe it is going to be space grey, but I'm not 100% sure yet. I'm elated, and just wanted to share my excitement somewhere.

AppleWatch,PSA: ALL original Apple Watches covered under extended battery swell warranty -- don't let Apple Store employees tell you otherwise,"The other day I woke up to find the screen on my original 38mm sport watch popped off. I've taken such good care of it, so naturally this was devastating. I took my watch to my local Apple store after reading [this article that says the warranty goes three years after purchase date rather than the typical one year](https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/28/apple-watch-expanded-swollen-battery-repair-coverage-warranty/) thinking that it applied to my model watch (the article only says it applies to first gen/series 0 watches.) The employee at the store went through all the required questions (""how long have you had the watch? any drops? any water? etc. etc."") and I thought we were getting to the part where he'd say ""Okay, here's your brand new watch, friend!"" but he instead asked for $200 to have it fixed (insane to ask that much to have a battery replaced when a new model is so close to the same price...). He told me that the warranty did not apply for the **aluminum** sport watch that I had, only for stainless steel models. 

So, unrelenting, I called Apple support and explained the situation. The rep put me on hold, did some research and found the warranty applies for ***all*** models in series 0 and as long as they found that the battery was swollen upon it being sent in, I'd get a replacement. It was weird because she and the other people in the call center she was in did not even know about the warranty before I told her. 

Fast forward 4 days and I have a new watch, despite the store employee telling me that it wasn't covered. Unfortunately they replaced it with another series 0 (I was hoping they'd end up sending a series 1, but I am grateful that they at least replaced the it!!)

I know that the extended warranty for series 0 has probably been discussed before, but I just wanted to post this so that anyone who faces the same issue as me knows that there *is* hope! Just call the Apple support line, be kind but firm, and you might find yourself with a replacement model.

Edit: warranty is good for 3 years after purchase date. So if you're outside that window, you might still be out of luck",73,355,2018-08-19,AAPL,0.06744828820228577,0.892188310623169,0.04036334529519081

apple,What Samsung is trying to promote with their anti-iPhone ads?,"Typo: What **is** Samsung trying to promote with their anti-iPhone ads?

Samsung has been pushing out a few nonsensical anti-iPhone ads, and then puts “Upgrade to Galaxy” at the end. I’ve watched the videos and I have no freaking idea how this would convince me to get an S9 or Note 9.

First ad: a woman struggling with a laggy 2014 iPhone 6 **running iOS 11**. [Video link here](https://youtu.be/3qhW1sDPHYI). That’s a 2014 flagship running the latest official software, and then trying to show how it’s slower than a brand-new 2018 S9. No Samsung 2014 flagship or Apple 2017 flagship was shown. The 2014 Note 4 only **officially** runs 2015’s Android 6, not to mention the laggy TouchWiz UI on top of it.

She then takes her 2014 iPhone 6 to an Apple Store, but on the way there, gets caught in the rain. She boards the wrong Uber, and someone with a water-resistant S9 puts her phone on the wet car window. If that water-resistant phone was an iPhone 8 or even a Pixel 2, does this mean she would have bought those phones instead?

She then reaches the Apple Store, which seems to be just a few miles away from the airport where she landed. Upon arrival, an Apple Genius assists her with the problem that she is facing on her 2014 out-of-warranty phone (unless she bought the iP6 in 2015 with AppleCare). The Apple Store was accessible to her, and a customer service person quickly attended to her, despite the phone being a few years old already. Apple has more service centers than Samsung in the US, and their customer service usually isn’t as good as Apple’s. So are they trying to convince me that Apple has better customer service? The Genius said to fix the slowness issue, she has to buy a new iPhone, which she later did..?

This lady then buys a Galaxy S9, and her brand-new phone is faster than a 4-year old phone. Umm wtf? So 4 years later she won’t have this slowness issue again?

Breakdown of ad:
* 2014 flagship phone is too slow
* 2014 flagship phone runs latest software
* 2014 flagship phone doesn’t have water-resistance
* Phone company assists customer with her 2014 flagship phone
* Phone with notch -&gt; Literally unusable

Second ad: Samsung claims that the S9 has faster download speeds than iPhone X. It has been proven that the Note 9 and iPhone X have identical download speed on Wi-Fi. They could be referring to the 1Gbps LTE speeds, which is almost nonexistent in many countries. This speed they’re referring to is based on your country and carrier’s infrastructure.

Third ad: Samsung claims the Note 9 is faster than the iPhone X. A brand-new flagship is faster than a 1 year old flagship. Shocker. Have they forgotten that the next flagship iPhone comes out next month. Plus, it’s been proven in benchmarks that the iPhone X is faster than the Note 9. So far not in real-world speed tests, but the next iPhone next month might change that.

Is there something I’m just not getting with these ads? The S9 and Note 9 are great phones, so why is Samsung just trying to point out their opponent’s flaws? It’s not like they don’t have their own flaws, for example Samsung’s outdated face-unlocking technology, and slow software updates. No phone is flawless, including the S9 and Note 9. They could bash other companies like Huawei, who is eating up Samsung’s marketshare, and plans to overtake them as world’s largest smartphone company. That’s their real opponent, especially since the P20 is a more comparable phone to the S9, at a similar price point.

In my opinion, they chose to bash Apple because they just want to make something attention-seeking and an ad which your uncle might send to your family group chat, and to prove Galaxy owners that they made the right decision. If they bashed Huawei instead, they surely wouldn’t have gotten as much attention and controversy, since Huawei is currently not being sold in the US, and they’re target audience is Americans, who largely use iPhones.    They should have tried to showcase their phones unique, less gimmicky abilities instead, especially Samsung Pay, since many retailers in the US don’t accept Apple Pay, and no other Android phone has this Samsung Pay MST technology. They should have promoted these features, instead of bashing iPhone X’s lack of a fast charger out of the box (though I definitely want Apple to include their 18W charger inside the box). What are your opinions on these ads, because I’m not sure if these ads are really to promote their phones at all.",386,658,2018-08-22,AAPL,0.03693757951259613,0.9076723754405975,0.05538998916745186

apple,"Once again: Apple Music NEEDS to separate Studio Albums from Singles, Live Versions, Collections, Special Editions etc.","Title says it all. I really love pretty everything about AM, it's interface, controls and integration with my Mac and iPhone - and my own music library. But I REALLY can't stand how it puts Studio Albums together with Live Versions, Special Editions, Singles and pretty much every form of release for any artist.

This gets specially bad when you're trying to discover a new artist with 20+ albums and you can't really understand their career, musical and stylistic progression through years, their work properly.

Check Red Hot Chili Pepper's, Foo Fighter's, Pearl Jam and even Prince's catalog. Simply a mess.

This used to be the case for Spotify too, but they've just separated the Studio Discography from the rest of the artists' releases. But I don't want to switch, I heavily dislike it's interface and lack of integration with my own collection and downloads.

apple,Update on my MacBook Pro story,"Back in February, I bought a 2017 15 inch MacBook pro fully maxed out everywhere except the SSD. Since I’ve gotten it, it’s been issue after issue. In March the graphics card was having issues and the display was flickering so apple replaced the logic board and the display. When I received it back I notified a dent they had put in the case, so they decided to send it back a second time to replace the display. Since then it’s been fine up until this weekend when I was working on a project in Xcode when all of a sudden the laptop shut off and wouldn’t boot. I called apple support and they said it is a SSD failure as disk utility couldn’t find the SSD. so I took it to the apple store and started talking to the genius. He spent two minutes with me, saw that this device was in for 2 repairs (this being the 3rd) in less than 6 months so he went to speak with the manager.

apple,"3D Touch is discoverable, if implemented properly. Apple's thoughts on the topic from WWDC.","With the rumors that Apple may be removing 3D touch from the 2018 iPhones, I was reminded of a talk from WWDC ""Designing Fluid User Interfaces"" that dove a bit into 3D Touch.  In the talk, a UX representative from Apple gives a great example of how to make 3D touch discoverable, using the example of the flashlight icon on the iPhone X lock screen:

[Video Link, explanation happens at 37:45](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/).  I highly recommend watching if you can, since the visuals really drive the point home, but here's the transcript as well:

&gt; Bounciness can also be used as a utility, as a functional means. It can serve as a helpful hint that there's something more below the surface. With iPhone 10, we introduced two buttons to the cover sheet for turning on the Flashlight, and for launching the Camera.  To avoid accidentally turning on the flashlight by mistake, we require a more intentional gesture to activate the Flashlight. But, if you don't know that there's a more intentional gesture needed to activate it, when you tap on the button, it responds with bounciness. Has this kind of playful feel to it.  And, that hint is teaching you not only that the button is working, but that it's responding to you. But, it's kind of teaching you that if you press just a little bit more firmly, it'll activate. It's like teaching you. It's hinting in the direction of the motion. So, bounciness can be used to indicate this kind of thing.


I thought this explanation was really neat, and that 3D Touch can totally be discoverable if implemented well.  You may think it's not obvious enough, but have you met someone who didn't know how to use the flashlight buttons on the iPhone X?  I think the issue is that this 3D Touch hinting is not implemented by most developers.  Throughout iOS, it's implemented very well.  Similar bounciness happens in Control Center, and on App Icons.

So what do you think?  Does this bounciness change your opinion on how discoverable 3D Touch is?",135,278,2018-08-28,AAPL,0.02719217725098133,0.9253239035606384,0.0474839061498642

apple,I feel a bit sad for Apple engineers,"Picture this:
You're an engineer at Apple. This is, of course, the most popular consumer technology company on the planet so you're pinned down with work on very important products. 

It is already common knowledge that in the middle of September the boss Tim will step on a stage with Hair Force One and Phil ""Can't Innovate, My Ass"" Schiller to introduce some new stuff. You happen to be one of the employees in the teams that are involved in developing the Apple ________ (insert product here). A lot of sweat, head scratching, and intense discussions with coworkers needed to happen to make the new generation of the _______ become a reality. 

Since you work at Apple, you're the one your entire family (inner and outer circle) and friends wow at when you meet up. 

""Oh my God you work at Apple?!? 
Wow. That must be great! 
*Whispering* 
So what do you know about the next version of the _________ that's coming up in September, per the rumors?""

You remember your training. Bite your tongue, smile and shrug. Don't say a thing. A lot of man hours and attention to detail went into building up the keynote hype so you don't want to blow it and risk your job. The one thing is that you can't wait to tell everyone what you worked on after the keynote given that you are so proud of the _________ that will get announced.

Comes in the picture Brad. Brad got a hold of the marketing materials and official keynote media in the weeks before things got announced. Brad may or may not be an employee at Apple, but what matters is that Brad messed up all the work you and countless other put in that product that will be used by hundreds of thousands around the globe.

Pics get to the media and go viral. At your next family or friends meetup before the keynote the inquiries about the keynote will be more precise and focused. You still keep quiet because it's a matter of principal (and yeah your job is still on the line) but deep down you know the thunder is gone. 

Man does that suck! I agree a lot with Tim Cook that there is a special place for those who leak years of hard work and steal the moment. I hope Apple still knocks some socks off regardless of whatever got out.",196,706,2018-08-30,AAPL,0.05407793074846268,0.9141911864280701,0.03173087537288666

apple,"Dear Apple, please make the other end of the Apple Pencil an eraser","I can not tell you how many times I’ve gone to flip my pencil around to erase part of something I’m working on, only to remember that the top of the Apple Pencil is just a plastic cap :(. This would be so useful, in so many different applications. 

EDIT: There’s been a lot of discussion on whether it is more intuitive to flip the pencil around to erase, or if it’s more natural to have an undo button on the screen, as your left hand naturally rests to the side of a piece of paper. Before my iPad Pro, I used a Wacom drawing pad and stylus, which has this flip-to-erase functionality, so for me personally it definitely the former that comes more naturally. However, if the goal of the iPad Pro/Pencil duo is to replace analogue paper and pencil as seamlessly as possible, my question is this; how seamless is it to divert your eyes from your work, tap a particular corner of your canvas to erase (not undo, mind you) a particular part, and then return your gaze?",161,759,2018-08-31,AAPL,0.03114507719874382,0.9304223656654358,0.03843251243233681
