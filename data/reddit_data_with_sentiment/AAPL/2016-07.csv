iphone,I Have Been an Android User for 8 Years and Decided to Buy the iPhone SE: Here Are My Impressions!,"Hey everybody!

As the title says, I have been an Android user (and former fanboy) for roughly 8 years. My first device was the Galaxy S Epic 4G on Sprint and my most recent was the Galaxy S6 on VZW. I have had about 4 Android phones in between then, but have always kept up with the latest news, reviews, and everything else in both the Android and Apple world. 

I bought the iPhone SE last week after wanting an iPhone for about 6 months. I had the S6 for exactly 1 year which I bought purely out of the hype after watching the keynote announcement. Samsung *really* sold it to me after I had swore off buying another Galaxy device after my S4. The hype wore off after 3 months of owning the device. This made me think to myself:

""What is it about a smartphone that matters to me the most? And what device meets all of those checkpoints?""

We pay out the wazoo for new smartphones, so I told myself I would no longer pay for an expensive device that didn't meet all of my needs. Quit listening to the hype and to the big-name reviewers and do the research myself. 

The key checkpoints in a smartphone that matter to me are:
*Battery Life* - I want to be able to actually use my phone for a day for whatever I want and know that it will make it.
*Software Updates and confidence of longevity* - Am I going to buy this phone and get screwed with updates/support that takes forever to roll out to me and then stops a year and a half after it's released?
*Camera* - Does the camera perform as good as I expect it to?
*Performance* - I want to UX to be seamless and pleasant to use. I am appalled that a $600+ that has an octo-core processor and 3 GB of RAM (Galaxy S6) has performance hiccups frequently.
*App Support* - Are the apps nice to use? Do they get updated frequently? I am a Google services user and I get can every app I need on either OS.


My initial impressions:

*Battery Life*
Wow, the battery life on the SE is insane. I can comfortably use it all day without having battery anxiety. It is closely on-par with the 6/s Plus. The first full day of usage I had 7+ hours of Usage and 17.5 hours of Up Time with little background activity/music playing and went to bed with 8% left. That is insane regarding how small the battery is in the SE; around 1600 mAh if I recall correctly. iOS does an amazing job with battery management. My S6 had to be charged twice to make it through a full day comfortably, often achieving only 3 hours of Screen on Time and 14 hours of Up Time. Horrendous.

*Software Updates*
We all know Apple does a great job with keeping their devices up to date and providing timely updates no matter the carrier you're on. The update is available at the same time as everyone else's and succeeding updates are available. Not much else to say. I love it.

*Camera*
The camera on the SE is the same as the camera on the 6s. 12 MP shooter with f/2.2 aperture. No OIS. Takes amazing camera shots, 4K and 240 fps slow motion videos. It focuses and captures the shot quickly. I cannot complain about the quality of this camera. And, if need be, I use the S6 as a secondary camera because that is one thing Samsung did an excellent job on.

*Performance*
The SE has the same A9 chip; 2 GB of RAM; blazing fast, SSD-like storage (I opted for 64 GB); but has a 1st generation Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The performance is what you would expect from an iPhone: fluid and snappy. Due to the speed of the A9 chip, the fingerprint sensor is also extremely fast. It reads my fingerprint every time and unlocks the phone. I would say it is 80%-90% as fast as the 2nd gen. sensor on the 6s/Plus. It's great. I am extremely pleased with the speed of the SE. General use is nearly flawless.

*App Support*
Apps are great on iOS, ESPECIALLY THE GOOGLE APPS. Holy shit. I find it funny that Google's apps are better on iOS than they are on Android. They have more features, get updated regularly, and all of them have the same fluidity that you would see across the rest of iOS. I don't find the lack of default app settings to be a burden either. Often times, a long press within the Twitter app will have the option to open in Chrome. I always type in the address in Google Maps. Entering in my Google Account information synced my contacts, bookmarks, etc. I turned off Gmail in the Mail app and just use the actual Gmail app. Honestly, all apps work great on iOS. Made a separate folder for all of Apple's apps (I cannot wait until I can hide/get rid of some of them in iOS 10. That will be nice).


*Miscellaneous Features*
I love that I can easily set which apps I want to sync/run in the background.
I also love that I can set which apps use location and under which circumstance they can access location (Never, While using the app, or Always). I don't have to deal with Google Play Services eating up my battery for no apparent reason. 
Reminders and daily schedule in the notification panel is convenient. It is part of the OS and not a separate app.
Swiping from the left edge of the screen to go back is more convenient to me than pressing a button.
I can still Chromecast! Sweet!
iOS Calendar app works exactly as I want it to. Everything syncs with my Google Account flawlessly.

Lastly, the design of the SE is great. Well built and it's small so I can palm it easily. Very portable; it's like nothing is in my pocket. I use Gboard to swipe text which makes typing easy. iOS is built for a smaller screen and the screen itself is big enough. Text is clear when holding it how you normally would and the screen gets very bright in direct sunlight.

It's almost like using a Nexus device dare I say. Except...its iOS. I am really loving my new phone. It does everything I would want it to.

iphone,I just got an iPhone 6s a week ago after 4 years of Android use.,"I used to use Android only due to the added functionality and customization but after the need for imessage and the need from an upgrade from my s4 I got an 6s. It's very clear how much developers work on IOS apps, every app seems to be superior on IOS. I don't like how restrictive iOS is but the customization doesn't bother me anymore because I only have maybe 8 apps installed. The build quality is probably my favorite thing about the 6s. As of now ive been reccomend the 6s instead of an android counter part because  of how nice it is, although I feel like it is over priced. Between and iPhone 6s and a Nexus 6p I'd still probably pick the Nexus but that doesn't have Imessage. Basically I'm just trying to share what I like about my new phone lol.

apple,How the Apple Watch saved my mom,"EDIT: At the bottom
______

My mom suffers from allergies of some chemicals found in some detergents. My mom works as a housekeeper in a hotel in Downtown Manhattan and while cleaning a room, she came into contact with one of these chemicals. As you imagine, she gets the reaction cause by the allergies and if she isn't treated quickly, she might go to the hospital

She hurries to ask her manager permission to go outside an anti allergic to the pharmacy that's right besides the hotel she works at. Unfortunately, she leaves her phone in the hotel along with cash/cards to pay for this medicine. 

My mom doesn't know a thing about medicines, so she calls me whenever she is buying one so I can look up what it does and tell her which one is better and as you know, she has left her phone in the hotel so she isn't able to call me. 

During this moment, I text her to check in on her, and the watch vibrates. She was connected to the Wi-Fi of either the Hotel Staff network or the pharmacy's Wi-Fi. She dictates to the Watch that she needed to talk to me, so how can she talk to me if she doesn't have the phone with her. So I call her. She is talking from her Watch and I am talking on my phone. She describes me various medicines for the allergies so I tell her which one is the best one. 

Now is time to pay. She tells she forgot her card and cash upstairs in the Hotel. While she was talking to me, I hopped into her iCloud just in case I needed to Lost Mode her phone. I checked her settings and I noticed that she doesn't have any of her cards on Apple Pay, but mine. So I guide her to pay with my card before we hang up (The call must be ended to pay with A-Pay). 5 minute later she calls me from the pharmacy and tells me that she is getting better and that the reaction of the allergies are slowly going away. 

If she didn't have the Watch, I'm not sure what could have happened. She forgot everything in the Hotel and going back to get it and going downstairs again could have been critical as I said, if her allergies aren't treated fast, she could be sent to the hospital. 

I'm glad I picked up an AW for her!

__________

Okay, this blew up. Let me clarify a few things:

1-) Why does my mom work at a hotel, cleaning, when she knows she is allergic to cleaning utensils? 

She isn't allergic to all of them. But she still works at the hotel, because she wants to provide to her family, one way or the other. She is going to school in the meantime as well, so this is the only job she took in the meantime.

2-) Why doesn't she carry pills?

She just buys the medicine that has the fewest pills. That's on her, I don't know why. Well, either way, she wasn't carrying any that day, unfortunately.

3-) The AW didn't save her. YOU did and the medicine too. 

Okay, I know the title is bad af (I noticed after I posted it). We all put something to save her. Me, her manager, the Watch, the medicine, the guy working at the register, the water she drank with the pills, even the fresh air saved her. Okay? Sorry for the click bait title, it wasn't my intention.

4-) She is stupid/moron/idiot. Why doesn't she know which shit to buy?

First of all, refrain yourself of insulting my mom. I haven't insulted yours, not yourself, nor your family. Okay? I respect everyone's opinion, I respect everyone's family member, but once you insult my mom, you have crossed the line. If you really need to insult someone, insult me (I wouldn't care either way) but do not bring my mom to this. Sounds clear?",114,488,2016-07-05,AAPL,0.09678742289543152,0.8786092400550842,0.02460326813161373

So, if your lightning cable isn't fitting right, go find a paperclip to sacrifice, and fish out whatever junk is hiding at the back of the port!

apple,The new iOS 10 Photos app is fantastic,"I've gotta say, the new Photos app is impressing the hell out of me.
 
Not only is the UI a significant improvement (i.e. the album organization), but the machine learning is far better than I would have ever expected from a privacy-obsessed company like Apple.
 
I thought this would be an area where Apple isn't even in the same league as Google, but the gap is way smaller than I expected. The photo identification is genuinely good. Not quite Google-good, but probably 80% of the way there. This isn't like a Google Maps vs iOS 6 Apple Maps situation at all; it's genuinely competitive. The facial recognition captures the majority of pictures and when I type a search term like ""beer"" or ""animal"", it actually works.

Also, I'm having a blast playing around in the ""People"" album. It got the majority of faces right, and for all the stragglers and random faces, it's exciting merging them and adding names because the UI is incredibly well-designed, to the point that it's actually fun to use.

apple,Unlocking your device in the IOS 10 beta is unintuitive and an exercise in frustration,"So far I've enjoyed the new stuff iOS10 has brought to the table, but I feel the way unlock works now is an annoying  step backwards. In iOS 9, hitting the home button to wake the screen and leaving my finger on the Touch ID scanner would unlock the screen. Now the lock screen stays put and it says ""unlocked"" at the top of the screen, and if you wait, will give you a hint to ""press the home button to unlock."" To actually get to your home screen you have to hit the home button again (leaving your finger on the Touch ID won't do it, you actually have to press). This feels awkward and counter-intuitive, like the device is acting unresponsive. What was wrong with how IOS9 unlocked, hit home, leave finger on Touch ID, device unlocks? I'm guessing it's due to the lighting fast Touch ID scanner on the 6S and people FWPing the fact they just want to check the time and instead unlock their phone, ~~but at least make it a toggleable option or something~~. This change makes the process of unlocking feel clunky!

The option to enable the old behavior can be found here: General&gt;Accessibility&gt;Home Button&gt;Rest finger to unlock

Edit - judging by the comments, it sounds like this is happening on first gen Touch ID iPads, (maybe) not on iPhones, and that the behavior **should** be the same as iOS 9 if you hit the home button to wake the screen and leave your finger on the Touch ID. iOS 10 requiring a second home button press is what appears to be the buggy behavior.",127,250,2016-07-09,AAPL,0.03844911977648735,0.9289615154266357,0.03258936107158661

apple,Apple Maps on iOS 10 is giant leap forward.,"Having just recently downloaded the public beta, I decided to have a play with Apple Maps on the way home from work and I am so impressed with what Apple has done to this app. 

It is apparent from the moment you launch the app (and this is, for me, the greatest advancement) that a lot of time has been spent on making sure that all information is presented in big, clear typography against contrasting backgrounds so you only have to glance at the screen whilst your driving to know exactly where you are, where you need to go and your ETA etc. No need to squint and hunch over, everything is right there. 

The way it zooms out when you're on a long road gives you a great sense of your surroundings and when you approach a turn, the camera zooms in, reorientates itself and 'pushes you over' to the corner of the screen to allow you a better view of the turn ahead (hard to explain but extremely helpful when tackling a big junction or a roundabout as it gives you a much better view of what's to come). 

Traffic has been very accurate and the auto suggestions are excellent as they show you very clearly how much time you're saving and being able to pan and zoom during navigation allows you to assess the routes ahead. The ability to reroute via a petrol station for example is so easy to do and really elegantly done. Before, in iOS 9, the thought of interrupting a journey to sort something like this out was troubling but in Apple Maps on iOS 10 it's so effortless.  

I swear I do not work for Apple and I'm not Tim Cook lol I'm just so impressed by the refresh to this App. It's so much better than iOS 9 and the team behind the changes deserve some recognition. 

You really have to use it to understand, it's such a good experience. Very well done.",142,174,2016-07-15,AAPL,0.019297823309898376,0.8920462131500244,0.08865596354007721

I'm currently in the process of making a game... but unfortunately, there's no way for me to test how a colorblind person would see the game.

As Apple has become more sensitive to people with disabilities for example creating cool algorithms to accurately count steps for those who are in wheelchairs and the-like, I hope they can in the future incorporate some things like being able to see how different colorblind people will see your app through XCode (whether it be for any of their MacOS, iOS, watchOS, or tvOS).

I get a call from 941-845-9119 that says to call 800-815-5126. The recordings are using a voice synthesizer, and claims that 'Apple' has detected unusual activity on my iCloud
account. I don't use iCloud. I pressed '1' to talk to a live rep. After waiting on hold for a minute, a man with an Indian accent answered from a call center. I could hear dozens of not hundreds of operators in the back ground. It was clear he didn't know which scam I was calling about, and tried to feel around for which way he should go. He kept trying to dig for user name and password information, saying it was for 'the technicians'.

He quickly grew tired of me stalling and became abusive. For the next several minutes he spouted obscenities and took great delight in trying to insult me.

I will bring usb and sd flash drives with me so I can test those ports. I will check SSD's smart status and battery health. 

Is there anything else I can do for such a short period of time that will ensure I'm buying a perfectly functioning Mac?

What is concerning me is that the seller was trying to quickly get rid of the Mac (telling me that he wants to buy the 15 inch) and even dropped the price by 100 EUR without even me starting negotiating. So it may be one of those too-good-to-be-true deals.

2) Today is my birthday (aww shucks, thanks! You shouldn't have!), and so I received a lot of ""Happy birthday!!"" messages.

&gt; ""Palm"" of foot

&gt; Nose (very difficult)

&gt;Back of index finger (very difficult)

&gt; Earlobes

&gt; Tip of Penis (underside)

apple,"The app ""8 ball pool"" is deliberately making players who buy their virtual coins lose in order to get them to buy more.","The app ""8 ball pool"" is deliberately manipulating their game in order to get existing customers to spend more money by unfairly taking what they've bought. 

I've finally tested this enough to where I think that whether or not it is happening is indisputable. 

First of all I'd like to clarify about what this app is. It's a free game where you play virtual pool/billiards against other players. You also have the ability to play gambling minigames within the app that allow you to gamble coins, which are one of the virtual currencies within the game. 

This game, from the time you download it, will do nothing but try to make the game all about paying money. Without paying money it is impossible for you to get off the ground, unless you were to get an impeccable streak of luck. On every intermediary screen between games there are messages telling you that if you want to get ahead, you NEED to spend real money.

So how does this actually work?

If you've spent money buying anything on their game you are going to be put against Guest accounts when you play in high amount 1 on 1 games. These accounts all have similar statistics, typically under 100k coins in winnings even though they are playing in large amount lobbies, and a win rate of 50-60%. These accounts have near perfect accuracy with every shot, and they will never say anything using the chat feature.

You are going to lose to these. You'll either strike, or your balls will bounce out of the pockets, and on the very rare occurrence (from what I found it seemed to be about 10% against these accounts, even with my win ratio being about 70%) you'll possibly win. The other 90% of the time you will lose. Once you're back to being low on coins you'll be prompted with a ""special offer"" to buy more coins for real money, with the offering giving x2-x3 what the store would typically give. Bear in mind you wont be put against these accounts in ever high account match, and it's possible not everyone is being put against them, but this was my experience with the app. They want money, as much as possible, and this is what they are doing to get it.

I tested this on 3 different devices, using 3 different internet access points, logged in through 3 separate facebooks account, and spent $10+ on each of them. The friend who referred me to the app told me he ran into the same thing.",32,185,2016-07-23,AAPL,0.036536719650030136,0.9369630813598633,0.02650023065507412

* 17-40 f4 L @ 17mm f4

There also is edit data if you have a deeper EXIF data checker.

1. Open photos app and view any album with a lot of photos (camera roll preferred).
2. Choose ""Select"" at the top right corner.
3. Select the bottom right most photo and, while still holding your finger down, slide across the screen to the far left photo in the same row.
4. Now, still without letting go of the screen, slide your finger up to where it shows the time and watch as the page scrolls up and all of your photos become selected.

apple,Lets assume the iPhone 7 doesn't offer anything other than what the rumors tell us,"I'm gonna pray that apple has some sort of crazy trick up their sleeve to surprise us, but lets for the sake of conversation assume that the new iPhone 7 will only have these features...

-Neat redesigned antenna lines
-Bulgy camera lens, and dual lense on 7 plus ( I can't keep bias out of it, I fucking hate the look of the single lens... )
-Dual speakers
-No audio jack port
-Wireless charging
-3D Touch home button

EDIT: Oh yea! And Wide color is coming to the iPhone 7! That's one of the sort of exciting things, lets not forget about that.

A couple of those are unlikely to be in the iPhone 7, but they were rumored so lets pretend.
But if you're interested...
3D touch home button and wireless charging look unlikely.

WOULD YOU or WOULD YOU NOT buy the iPhone 7?
Yea, its a little faster.. But for such minimalistic improvements, why not just buy an iPhone 6s for cheap when the 7 comes out (assuming you don't have it) or just buy a different apple product like an apple watch two?

iphone,"I think FB is linking to my contacts without my permission, but other people say that's not possible","A side discussion in the thread '[Does the iPhone now eavesdrop too?](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/4up5f8/does_the_iphone_now_eavesdrop_too/)' was discussing whether FB is checking your phone history or contacts without permission. I think it is.

Here's my particular scenario (which has happened more times than I can count);

FB is suggesting people as friends that it has *no business* knowing that I know them. 

FB is not set up to have access to my contacts. I do not have my phone number added to my FB account, and I signed up with an e-mail address used solely for FB. 

I meet a girl on a dating app and we trade phone numbers. She’s saved in my phone as ‘Mary (tinder)’ and I don’t know how I’m saved in her phone but she doesn’t have my last name. She has *only* my phone# and first name. Not even an email address. 

We text a few times. A short time later, she shows up on FB under ‘people you may know.’ I click on her profile and confirm we have no friends in common.

How in the world is FB making that connection?! Other than looking in my (or her) text messages and seeing recent phone numbers? 

In the other thread, people are insisting that there’s no way FB could access my contacts or my text app to see this info, but I’m skeptical that it’s doing it anyway, because FB is the paradigm of being shady as fuck when it comes to collecting your personal information. 


**Edit:** Thanks for all the replies and good suggestions!
Couple of clarifications: It’s not tinder. I set up a ‘dummy’ FB account to link to Tinder specifically so that it wouldn’t have a decade’s worth of personal info attached. So while the tinder connection is a good thought, it’s not the culprit.
 
Best suggestions so far is that it probably got my number from WhatsApp, which I do have installed.
Alternately, it’s possible (maybe likely?) that some other friend of mine shared *their* contacts on their phone, which includes my name and #, and FB took that data and associated the number with me.
 
However, what’s **still unclear** is how FB knows that I’ve started texting someone new. I’m not using WhatsApp for my texting, just the regular iMessage. And people don’t start popping up in my suggestions until after I call or text them.",129,159,2016-07-26,AAPL,0.047934696078300476,0.9268889427185059,0.025176433846354485

apple,Pocket Casts 6.0 update,"I've never been a fan of Overcast and although it's been installed on iPhone on few occasions, I've always gone back up Pocket Casts and after 2 years sans update, Pocket Casts is updated to v6.0. And yes, apparently it's a free update.


Some of the highlights of the new version:

- **Swifter than Swift**
&gt; The majority of the app has been re-written in Apple’s modern programming language, Swift. This gives us amazing performance and stability improvements over the old code base. 

- **Redesigned User Interface**

http://i.imgur.com/O3PQrhv.jpg

&gt; We’ve always been proud of the Pocket Casts User Interface. It’s simple to understand, easy to use and it doesn’t hurt that it looks good as well. Instead of throwing that all out and starting again we’ve refined every part of it. Many things can now be accomplished faster than before and it just looks and works so much better.

- **Trim Silence And Volume Boost**

- **Dark Theme**

- **And Much Much More**

&gt; There’s improvements to auto download, including a new waiting for WiFi state. There’s 3D Touch shortcuts for those of you with fancy new phones. There’s MP3 chapter support (including images) for all your favourite podcasts that are starting to support those. There’s a new filter option which lets you see only episodes that have come out in the last 24 hours, or a different time of your choosing. A new dedicated download area lets you see all your downloaded podcasts in the order you downloaded them and gives you options to quickly clean these up as well.

apple,PiP in macOS Sierra is AMAZING for watching YouTube tutorials while working!,"A great example of a feature that doesn't seem all that beneficial at first glance, but great in practice is PiP. The ability to use Picture-In-Picture to view YouTube tutorials while working on something is insane for my workflow. Not only does the video stay always on-top no matter what program I'm using, it's super easy to get to its controls as well as move around the window to fit my needs. Also, all that unnecessary background noise in a browser disappears without me having to resize any windows. 

An example of this was while I was working in Premiere Pro. It was painlessly easily for me to just pop the video out, and continue to follow along with a tutorial beside me, swiping it away when I needed too. My only compliant is that it could be even more powerful with scrubber controls. Maybe even the ability to pinch-to-zoom on the video to get a bit more clarity when viewing would be awesome.

I would upgrade to Sierra solely for this feature alone. Thanks Apple expanding on my productivity in 10.12!",76,314,2016-07-29,AAPL,0.021774856373667717,0.910112202167511,0.06811294704675674

He is asking for Apple people (Tim Cook, Jimmy Iovine, Larry Jackson, Dez Bryant, and Drake) to get together with him, Jay-Z, and Scooter Braun, who manages Kanye as well as ton of other major artists. This is very interesting to me as a Ye fan, I've wanted this forever and it seems like Kanye wanted to work with Apple from the beginning but felt like he owed it to Jay-Z to support his friend's endeavors. Current possibilities are: the deal is already complete and this is just a marketing move to get people ready for Apple to control streaming entirely or the deal was underway but maybe Jay-Z has been asking for more than Apple was willing to pay and this is Kanye, frustrated with the process, trying to get it over with. Interesting to see how Apple or Tim Cook will respond to the comment about ""Stop trying to act like you're Steve"".

I'm a little thrown back but hey as a video editor, I used and abused this iMac so it probably could of been a anything,  so I agree to their terms to replace it. I get a call a few days later and they say my GPU needs to replaced and it will cost X amount of dollars. I tell ask what about the GPU replacement program and they said because their test says it passed it this doesn't fall into the replacement program. I asked them how did they determine my GPU was bad, and they said because of a test they ran. I yelled at the poor tech probably just relaying info but f I feel like i'm being cheated into paying money for something they acknowledge has problems, say they are willing to replace it for free, but turn around and say nope ""your card passed the test that determines if it's part of the program but failed the test that determines if it's bad.""
