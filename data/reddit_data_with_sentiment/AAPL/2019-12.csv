apple,Apple December 2019 Event | Live Event Thread,"*Tim Cook voice*

&amp;#x200B;

**GOOD MORNING! GOOD MORNING! GOOD MORNING!**

&amp;#x200B;

\#Right now there is an Apple media event in NYC that started at 4pm EST.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Loved by millions. Created by the best.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple is honoring its **""favorite apps and games of 2019.""**

&amp;#x200B;

This event will NOT be live-streamed so we will need to rely on live-blogs and real-time tweeting from attendees.

&amp;#x200B;

This event is the first of it's kind, so we really don't know what to expect.

&amp;#x200B;

From MacRumors:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not clear if any hardware will be introduced at the event, but it seems unlikely given the clear wording of the media invites. We're still expecting Apple to release the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR in December, so there could be a mention of an official launch date, but beyond that, no more hardware refreshes are rumored for this year.

&amp;#x200B;

From 9to5Mac:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It seems very unlikely but could Apple sneak in a “One more thing…” at the event as a holiday surprise and show off or announce AirTag or something else? Maybe some plugs or more details on the Mac Pro launch that’s slated for December?",1506,1506,2019-12-02,AAPL,0.02832694910466671,0.9250259399414062,0.04664713516831398

iphone,Want to thank Apple,"A couple of years ago, BatteryGate (is it called that?) made me switch away from the Apple ecosystem and on to Android. I bought a OnePlus that was cheaper, better camera, amazing battery etc etc.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, and my work upgraded my work phone to an XR 64GB (yes, in end 2019).

Amazingly, I picked it up and turned it on, and completely fell in love with it. My OnePlus 6 bested the XR in literally every category on paper(more RAM, more megapixels, bigger battery, more space etc etc etc), but couldn’t come close to the sheer joy and beauty of using an iPhone.

I spent a week getting all my apps and photos back, setting up iCloud, buying an Apple Watch (going full Apple, basically), and haven’t looked back yet. I still get a little burst of happiness every time I look at my phone, which is several times an hour.

Just in case anyone’s thinking of making the jump from Android to Apple - and the XR is the lowest end model from a year ago...",503,1259,2019-12-09,AAPL,0.03009231761097908,0.9086291790008545,0.06127847731113434

apple,Extraodinarily Unpopular Opinion: Lightning is better than USB-C,"I own dozens of USB-C and lightning devices.

In half of my USB-C devices, like my macbook pro, ports have loosened to the point where cables don’t stay in, USBs and attachments have become wiggly, etc. USB-Ca design relies purely on friction, and when you use the ports frequently that friction slowly disappears. Plus, the ports are larger than lightning ports.

Lightning’s design causes it to snap into place because it has grooves that fit the cable tip, making it more secure, satisfying, and easy to use. I have never had an issue with a lighting port becoming loose, and I cannot break the inner port as easily as I can with USB-C. 

The fact that I have to carry around an extra cable does not bother me at all, it is a few extra ounces in my bag and I feel like detractors of lightning exaggerate the inconvenience of having another cable.

I hope Apple keeps the lightning port forever.",222,536,2019-12-18,AAPL,0.04901798814535141,0.9164451956748962,0.034536805003881454

apple,I Redesigned Apple Maps and Replicated an Apple Product Launch for it,"TL;DR: I took a lot of feedback (a lot from r/apple) and decided to redesign Apple Maps with features many have people have been requesting for years, plus a few that I think might add value. Check out my in-depth [case study blog post](https://medium.com/@aymanjaddaa/i-redesigned-apple-maps-and-replicated-an-apple-product-launch-for-it-468a03f10c92) or visit [aymanjaddaa.com](https://aymanjaddaa.com) to just see the visuals.

Over the past couple of months, I have been working on a project that I am finally ready to show to the world, and I’m really excited about it. I redesigned Apple Maps and came up with 2 potential apps Apple should consider developing - Apple Carrier, and Apple Authenticator. I'm posting this from my official account, I'm more active here on my throwaway account :)

For a long time, I’ve wanted to use Apple Maps more (and I'm sure you do too); the apps’ tight integration within the Apple ecosystem is something that I treasure, but I never really saw myself using it too much because using Google Maps was just so much easier, more reliable, and more fully-fledged. Things took a turn when iOS 13 came out this year, and my opinion took a 180° turn. I’ve been using Apple Maps much more often ever since, but I still found that it had a lot of missing features that many other navigation apps had implemented years ago, and I wasn’t alone in this; many other users also help this opinion. I thought to myself: “why not try designing a version of Apple Maps that many users have been asking for?” So I gave it a shot at designing what the future Apple Maps might look like. 

The main objectives of this project were to (1) incorporate all the feedback many Apple users (especially in r/apple) had for Apple Maps and come up with a viable solution, (2) showcase my product design skills, and (3) have fun with this process. 

Just to point out, this was all done in good faith; massive kudos to the Maps team for all their amazing work. All odds were against them since day 1, but they’re surely getting there. I really hope someone from the team sees my work and sees my ideas.

It was really exciting, eye-opening, and a lot of fun, and I’m so excited to finally have the world see my work. If you know anyone who would be interested in my skill sets, all I ask is if you have enjoyed my work (which I’m confident you will), to please share it with your friends, peers, co-workers, hell, even your dog (just kidding, of course).

Once you’re done, be sure you take a look at the [Apple Carrier](https://aymanjaddaa.com/work/apple-carrier) MVP app and the [Apple Authenticator](https://aymanjaddaa.com/work/apple-authenticator) app concepts I’ve also been working on. They’re both on my portfolio at [aymanjaddaa.com](https://aymanjaddaa.com)

mac,Screen Time thinks I spend all my time online on pornhub.com,"I finally updated to macOS Catalina last week. Today I remembered that Screen Time got added to mac so I went to check it — only to find that I apparently spend an average 5-6 hours on pornhub every day. I will admit I did visit the site like 2 weeks ago through the reddit app on my phone, but that was it. Now, whenever I'm online on my mac, Screen Time thinks I'm on pornhub. I've never even visited the site on my laptop. I looked at the data for every day and the amount of time it says I'm on pornhub is always exactly the same as the amount of time I'm on Safari. So no matter what website I'm on in Safari, for some reason it registers as being on pornhub.

The picture shows yesterday's info. As you can see, every time I was using the internet, it registered as being on pornhub. So I apparently spent a whopping 8 hours watching porn yesterday. I will admit it's kind of funny. Except it's not. How do I fix this?

EDIT: I feel like I should add this because of some of the comments I'm getting lol. I am in fact a female and I don't like porn. I almost never watch it, like seriously maybe only twice a year. That's why I'm so baffled by Screen Time telling me I spend all my time on ph.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the suggestions y'all! (And entertaining comments) Tried a bunch of tips including clearing cache and cookies, deleting all website data on my phone, and even deleting the reddit app on my phone. Restarted my mac and when I opened Screen Time all the data was changed and there's no sign of pornhub anywhere (the rest of the stats for other apps/sites remain unchanged though). Kind of weird that it completely disappeared even from previously recorded stats but all your suggestions seem to have worked! All the time I spent on safari today is no longer being shown as ph. Thanks for the help and all the laughs y'all!

iphone,My favourite weather app removed their radar widget which gave an INSANELY useful instant view of local weather conditions! Does anyone know of another widget that shows local weather radar?,"I happily paid for Weather Underground as I used [their widget](https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/weather-underground-widgets-screens-400x703.jpg) several times a day to check for precipitation in my area, since here in Toronto the forecasts are typically done at the airport which often has very different weather than down where I live on the lake. However their latest update has removed the widget and I'll be damned if I can find a replacement!

Does anyone know an app that has a radar weather widget like Weather Underground used to have?

EDIT: thanks for all the suggestions folks but I'm looking for an app that shows weather radar *in the widget*, not in the app itself! A list of apps that do not have widgets or do not have radar in their widgets:

* AccuWeather
* Carrot
* Dark Sky
* MyRadar
* RadarScope
* Weather Mate
* Weather Underground (RIP)
