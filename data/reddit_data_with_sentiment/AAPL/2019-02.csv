AppleWatch,Something really embarrassing happened last night because of my Apple Watch,"I was with a few friends having our weekly FIFA get together and we were all having fun and talking about the things that guys do, you know... Girls, farts, swearing etc. Suddenly I hear my apple watch talking to me asking me if I wanted to leave a message. I panicked and pressed the red button straight away... It turns out my Apple Watch had accidentally called my boss from 4 years ago and I had been recording me and my friends for 7 minutes straight and sent it to his answer machine. How did this happen? He definitely heard some messed up stuff in those 7 minutes I'm sure. He text me 20 minutes later saying ''Ummm, did you mean to leave me a 7 minute voice message?'' I just ignored the message and deleted it and pretended this never happened, maybe he will think I have changed phone or something.

I honestly don't know how it happened, it was just on my wrist the whole time. So please, be aware that this can happen to anyone.",60,445,2019-02-01,AAPL,0.0917033702135086,0.8793290853500366,0.028967557474970818

AppleWatch,Your carrier may pay to fix your broken watch.,"I cracked the screen of my S3-LTE about a month ago, and the screen became unresponsive. Fixing it is $289, and I didn’t want to pay that much, so I was just going to leave it while I considered what to do. I contacted t-mobile service to cancel my watch data plan, and the agent offered to reimburse me for the repair if I kept the plan.  Not sure if that’s a fluke or a policy, but keep that in mind if your watch is broken. I had no apple care or other protection plan.

apple,Apple replaced my 2015 MacBook Pro with a 2018 MacBook Pro,"So I had the Anti-reflective coating issue on my 2015 15 inch MacBook Pro. I had the display replaced 2 times because of the extended 4 year program. It finally happened for a 3rd time. I spoke to a senior rep over the phone about replacing the whole unit...he agreed to give me a replacement laptop of the same value. So I scored a 2018 MacBook Pro 15 inch! So excited to have this beast!! 

Edit: A lot of people are saying negative things about the 2018 MacBook Pro. I’m not complaining. As a college student this is an amazing upgrade. I’m a professional photographer and the processing power is insane.

You can also create routines to combine actions for all these things. For example I have a dinner routine which pauses the TV, plays soft dinner music, and turns on the dinner lights. I have a bedtime one that turns off the lights and plays white noise. These support siri shortcuts so you can say ""Hey Siri dinner time"" to execute. 

(The tile view for the homekit accessories is coming in an update in a few days, the current build has the homekit devices as rows, like the screenshots in the appstore show)

apple,PSA: Changing country in Apple Music completely deletes your library with no option to recover,"Hello all,

I recently moved back to my home country after living abroad a few years, one of the first things I wanted to do was switch over my Apple ID to my new local debit card, however, you cannot do that without unsubscribing to Apple Music. After googling, it seems Apple keeps your data up to 30 days after unsubscribing, i figured that was fine since I was planning on re-subscribing right away. Well, as it turns down, if you change country, they completely delete your library, contrary to what I´ve read both online and here, its completely gone. According to Apple Support, this was a recent change.   

&amp;#x200B;

[After spending over an hour](https://i.imgur.com/dg3nGrc.png) with Apple on the phone, they were unable to help me, said i should re-build my massive library, and this is probably a good time to mention Im a bit of an organizational freak, all my songs were organized into smart playlists, with tags, custom genres, lyrics, i even had my own music uploaded, each carefully edited with all details filled out to blend with my Apple Music library. 

&amp;#x200B;

I´ll be switching to Spotify as this is just completely disappointing, and as a person who is all-in on Apple products I am dissapointed in Apple. The fact that all customer service could do was link me to the feedback pages says it all. If anyone else is considering switching countries on their Apple ID´s, migrate your songs over to somewhere else first. If you are going abroad and wanna change to your local card, dont.",402,3641,2019-02-05,AAPL,0.03690161928534508,0.9258050918579102,0.03729330375790596

apple,Lessons to learn from the aftermath of a stolen iPhone,"Hello everybody, let me start telling you all that this post is not about how my stupidity left me without my iPhone but the aftermath because (at least for now) I am grateful for the iCloud lock and lost iPhone feature and this post is for those who may (but I wish no one ever found in this situation) found themselves in a similar situation.

My iPhone got stolen so I get home and lock it using find my iPhone and as I was expecting the iPhone wasn’t reachable but the signal for stolen iPhone was made.

I got into a business trip out of the city and a week later I receive a notification that my iPhone was founded by the found my iPhone App and showed me the location but at this point I know is near impossible to recover that Phone so I started to send request to start making noises and until the Phone was turn off… everything normal so far but HERE STARTS THE INTERESTING AFTERMATH.

The day after my iPhone was located I started to receive SMS from “apple” telling me that my iPhone was found but these SMS at first were from local numbers and then from numbers outside my country and all of them was the exact description of my iPhone (model, capacity, color) and came with a link, now I am an IT professional and I know that you never ever go to a link blindly no matter what and the link on all SMS was directed to “corp.apple.com.id” so I right away got doubts and didn’t click on them over a whole week I keep receiving these messages so In a protected isolated connection I copy the link to a PC and open it and it redirects to a portal exactly the same as the iCloud login portal but you only have to watch the address to see that is fake if I remember correctly “portal.recoveryicloud.com” after confirming my suspicion I started to delete the messages just as they arrived. This week I started to read post from several websites about how the thieves are using social engendering to bypass the iCloud lock and other methods I was aware of websites offering unlocks but always thought they were a scam and these reports and my experience makes me thing is almost (right now) to bypass the iCloud lock on a stolen iPhone and then today the last attempt… I receive a call from “Apple” from a hidden phone id, the guy tells me that my phone was recovered because somebody tried to unlock it requesting it to a carrier and because of that my phone was recovered and he needed information because is a service by Apple, again I am a professional IT on security and you must, never ever give any information if you weren’t the dialer of that call, the guy wanted me to send him a copy of my purchase receipt and other documentation over email and I told him no and if my phone was truly founded and want me to retrieve it I gave him two options to send the phone to an Apple store and I deal with the personnel there or give an internal phone from Apple were I can reach him or other person and asked his name, the guy refused to everything and hang up the phone.

Right now, because of all these attempts of social reverse engineering, I still believe that iCloud lock cannot be passed by normal means. If you ever found yourself in this kind of situation don’t fall for it even if you wish it is true and got excited to hear that your phone was recovered, life goes on and as long as you are alive, you’ll find the way to get yourself another phone and learn from your mistakes.",105,541,2019-02-08,AAPL,0.07182585448026657,0.9008458256721497,0.027328303083777428

AppleWatch,[TIP] You can deactivate any alarm by covering the watch's screen: Even the ones from your iPhone.,"I always forgot to post this, but I didn't see it addressed in this subreddit as of yet. 

Everybody knows you can deactivate an alarm on the apple watch when it goes off by simply covering the screen for two seconds. But once I just instinctively tried to do the same while in bed when my iPhone's alarm went off  (not the one on the watch) and it worked the same way. Try it: set an alarm on your iPhone in one minute, and when it goes off, cover your watch's screen with the palm of your hand.

iphone,"With new OLED iPhones, I wish Apple would allow front LED notification lights...","So anyone who's had a blackberry or older android devices knows what I'm talking about... the cool little LED light on the front of the phone that would light up when the phone was locked to nonchalantly let you know you had a new text, email, missed call, etc. 

Unfortunately, iPhones never had this feature. HOWEVER, something that I find interesting with new OLED displays is quite interesting, and I wonder if Apple would ever consider doing it.

Since the new iPhones with OLED displays can activate only certain pixels on the display (so if the screen is black, it can turn on certain pixels; this is how Android phones use this for the ""Always-On"" display where it shows the date and time). 

Why can't Apple use this technology and put it to the left or right of the notch just making a little glowing light pop up while the phone is locked to allow us to see if we have a waiting notification?

I think it's a really cool and convenient idea. It doesn't require an actual LED light to be built into the phone, it just uses the pixels in a dot-like figure in the notification bar area to just glow. It may not be as bright as a real LED, but it's a pretty cool feature. And all it would take is an iOS update. 

Would anyone care for this? I would. I miss those LED notification lights so much. It's very useful IMO.",219,1859,2019-02-24,AAPL,0.026534464210271835,0.9370490312576294,0.03641657158732414

apple,"I figured out a way to permanently hide the 4 annoying popups to ""View BLAHBLAH in the official app"" when browsing this site on Safari","I have shared this a few months back but seems like Reddit recently updated and added another popup to their mobile site. So I did some digging and thought I would share the new adguard rules to hide the annoying popups.
I sometimes use google searches to find specific reddit posts and these popups have been getting very annoying recently. I was extremely annoyed by these popups taking over half my screen and not accepting ""No"" as an answer. This also lets me hide the other ""Open Reddit App"" and ""Use App"" buttons as I don't use the official reddit app anyway so they were pointless.

**Before/After Screenshot of what I am talking about:**

https://i.imgur.com/SPdSs8Y.png

It also hides google AMP banners for reddit as shown here:

**Before:**
https://www.dropbox.com/s/du8hz9tch93ttyl/Photo%202018-11-14%2C%2011%2038%2018%20PM.png?dl=0

**After:**

**Steps:**

1.	Use any free content blocker app available on store. I used [AdGuard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162?mt=8). The free version pretty much lets me do everything I need. I am NOT affiliated by them in any way. 
2.	In your content blocker app of choice, enter rules to hide the following classes:

    .dualpartinterstitial (this is for the bottom huge banner)

    .topbutton (This is for the “Use App” button at top)

    .xpromopill (This is for the “Open Reddit App” button at the bottom)

    .upsell_banner (For Google AMP Pages)

    .xpromopopup (The full screen modal popup with “See this community popup”)

    .adlinkbar (The “Promoted” links)

3.	So for AdGuard, launch the app, go to “User Filter” and enter the following:

    reddit.com##.dualpartinterstitial,.topbutton,.xpromopill,.xpromopopup,.adlinkbar
    
    \##.upsell_banner

**NOTE:** the .upsell_banner is used for when Reddit opens via Google AMP and since it’s coming from Google’s domain and not Reddit’s, .upsell_banner needs to be in a separate line.

Here’s a screenshot of it all:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/pai7ilhad6160xe/adguardrules.jpeg?dl=0

4.	Tap Done and it will take a few seconds to take effect.
5.	Completely quit Safari from the app switcher.
6.	Now whenever you visit reddit on safari, those would be permanently hidden!

**NOTE:** You can hide other UI elements on other websites this way too. However one thing I figured out while testing this was a bug (not sure if a reddit bug or AdGuard bug) is that **the class names need to be entered all lower cased for it to work**. 

You can also hide those annoying cookie notifications in AdGuard. Go to filters, scroll to annoyances section and enables the “I don’t care about cookies” filter.

Hope this helps someone!

**EDIT:** For those using 1Blocker, someone figured it out:

apple,Apple Music needs a major update in iOS 13.,"Hi all,

I've been an Apple Music user for about 3 years now. Although I love the service, and it has become a very integral part of my everyday routine - be it when I'm jogging, in the car or just at home - I think there are a lot of things that Apple needs to improve.

1. Discovery:  
One aspect where, in my opinion, Spotify blows Apple Music out of the water is discovery. Discovering new music is very essential for me and Spotify just makes it very easy to get the new releases to my notice. Even the iTunes app does a better job of letting me know the new releases, upcoming albums and so on.
2. Suggestions:   
Although Apple Music does a good job at recommendations, I think they can improve A LOT. The ""new music"" mix absolutely sucks, ""chill mix"" is still acceptable. The one that Apple absolutely nails is the ""Favorite mix"".
3. Playlists:  
I think everyone here can agree that if there's one thing Spotify knows how to do, it's to create awesome playlists. There's a playlist for every mood, every occasion, I love that. I also like how on the ""browse"" page, there's a playlist suggestion depending on what time of the day it is, brilliant. I hope Apple takes some inspiration from Spotify and tweaks up their playlists and curation. 
4. Recently Added:  
This is one feature I absolutely love, being able to see all my albums that I recently added makes it super easy to play as soon as I open the app. However, I do wish that Apple gives us the ability to pin certain albums and playlists to this list so that they're always there.
5. Shared playlists:  
Another feature available on a lot of different music streaming services, I think it's time Apple let its users collaborate on the same playlist.
6. Updated design:  
Th current Apple Music design was last updated with iOS 10. The current UI is not only quite complex, but has also started to look quite out-dates. I think this will change with iOS 13 (let's hope it does)

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if I sound like an Apple Music hater - I'm not. I use the service every single day and these are just some things I personally would like to see Apple improve.

I'm eager to know your thoughts, let's discuss.

TL/DR - There are a lot of things Apple Music needs to improve- such as Playlists, suggestions/curations, discovery, shared playlist, updated design.
