iphone,I tried to fix my sisters iphone and accidentally bricked it. I feel horrible. Please help me if you can.,"Ok, so my little sister came back from school and her iphone was acting up 3GS (frequently locking up and acting strange). She was upset about it and came to me for help. I connected it to iTunes to restore the phone to factory defaults...

...what I didn't know is that my brother had jailbroken it to use a different SIM in it. Now the SIM is no longer recognized and I pretty much screwed her over by not being very familiar with iPhones.

I've done some research, but there is a whole WORLD of iPhone knowledge and I've never kept up to date with it because I've never used one myself. Could you please point me in the right direction of any useful information on this topic?


I feel so awful for breaking her phone, but I seriously thought I could just restore the defaults.



EDIT after i've done more research*** 

Bad news: iOS 4.2.1 It is relocked to the original provider Good news: She has a spare ancient phone.
So I suppose my options are:
1) Wait until there is a new jailbroken version out there for 4.2.1 or a future version. (any idea how long this takes on average?)
2) Use a dodgy tool that is out there right now that will permanently downgrade the baseband and OS to a lower level, but I have no idea how good it is.
Guys, you see, if it was my own phone I would be angry, but I wouldn't feel NEARLY as bad because it isn't my own fault and property. On the other hand, why did my family EVER buy her a locked phone when there are perfectly fine factory unlocked phones out there. grrr. I just feel awful and I am trying my best to rectify this situation.",25,26,2011-03-01,AAPL,0.15776793658733368,0.8164945840835571,0.02573748677968979

iphone,Tiny Wings Improvements?,"**So, we all love Tiny Wings, and it's pretty much perfect as a casual game at the moment...but what would you like to see improved?**

I have seen some talk on other iPhone forums about making new power-ups etc, but I think that would make the game gimmicky, I think the coins in use at the moment are spot on.


I'd like to see simple little things like on screen coin counters and fever time counter added (it'd make those nest achievements a little easier to gauge).

As far as modes go, I'd really like to see more of a '*race*' element added. This could be done by adding a nemesis/buddy to play against in single player; for e.g.: seeing who could get to the 6th island first, creating specific (and longer) 'race' islands, or just creating a long and random landscape with the aim of reaching a certain 'distance' (obviously the distance measurement is arbitrary, but some sort of 'metres'/'yards' system would be easy to implement)
If there were a race mode, it'd also be cool to have your own 'ghost' fastest time to race against (a la 'Mario Kart'), and it'd be ESPECIALLY cool to have network racing against a buddy/online buddies on the one screen.
I really hope some Tiny Wings rip-off with race element isn't released to the App Store now..

Finally, if possible, I'd probably quite like a 'neverending' mode...that night sound kind of makes me depressed, and a lot of what I love about the game is landing a sweet swoop, it'd be cool to have the choice of doing that when I please.

apple,I (still) use my iPad every day.,"When the iPad launched it was met with uniform derision from a subset of critics. They wanted an OS X tablet and this... thing was an abomination to them. It was a shining beacon of what Apple was to become: a nanny-state for apps, locking them into a walled garden. It was simultaneously underpowered and over-designed, and was missing key features like USB ports, disk-mode storage, and the ability to use it as a phone. The iPad was a failure before it even launched.

When it was released it was fascinating to see the argument shift. After the first million sold (in a very short period of time) we were told that sales would peter out; the Apple faithful already had theirs. After the third million sold we were informed that ""the idiots with too much money"" demographic had been expended, and sales were sure to plummet. A year later we have seen contenders for the iPad's spot as *most popular tablet* but they've either been a day late (the Xoom, the PlayBook) or a dollar short (the Galaxy Tab - are there any plans to get it to Honeycomb?).

While the iPad was decried for being pricey not a single serious competitor has challenged it on price - a shocking thing to consider over the course of an entire year. In the meantime the app store is flourishing, and the iOS development community has been enriched by their investments. 

But what of iPad users? In the weeks and months after the iPad launch I saw more than a few posts wherein people were asking ""do you still use your iPad?"" and the answer at the time was predominantly yes.

I can only speak for myself, and perhaps those that work with me. In a 20m radius around me there are four people using iPads, out of 15. Each person has it with them daily. Mine is a sketchpad, a copy deck notepad, a proofing tool, and easy access to all of my project briefs–and that's just at work. At home it's my ebook reader, a gaming system, my Minecraft recipe reference, and hundreds of other things where I just need access to something ""for a minute"".

So yes, I still use my iPad every day. Do you?",114,50,2011-03-02,AAPL,0.03909249231219292,0.929989755153656,0.0309176966547966

apple,"Dear Apple, I'm effing impressed...","Not a Fanboy here, just an owner of a late 2007 Macbook - no iPhone, iPad, iPod, etc. The other day I noticed the battery in my MacBook was bulging so I called my local Apple Store (Munich) and made an appointment for this afternoon to get a replacement. Yesterday, as luck would have it, the top case developed a ""splinter"". For lack of a better description here's a [photo](http://imgur.com/a/cOh3o) of both the bulge and splinter. I went in with the expectation that the repairs would be expensive and wishing this would have happened 6 months ago while I still had Apple Care coverage.

I explained the two problems to the ""Genius"", and he said right away he'll fix the splinter for free and they have a replacement battery in stock that will cost me 95 EUR. I said that sounded good and for the hell of it asked him directly if he would give me the battery for free instead. He nodded his head and called somebody. Then he said the manager was going to come and talk to me. I nicely asked the manager if I could have the battery at no cost, and after he said no, I thanked him anyway and that was that. I signed the paperwork.

After 30 minutes of waiting, the guy brought my laptop back and new paperwork to sign. What was the sudden change? Total cost for the entire repair (including battery): 0 EUR! Not only that, they replaced the display bezel and the entire keyboard and trackpad as well. He smiled and said something like: ""That makes you very happy, right?"".

Improved performance and startup times on several apps

Higher resolution for several apps

and more.

**First, the new moderators:**

We got a handful of requests from people looking to help mod [/r/iphonehelp](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphonehelp) and after poring through everyone's profiles, we've decided on **[mystikalghost](http://www.reddit.com/user/mystikalghost)** and **[iWYSE](http://www.reddit.com/user/iWYSE)**. Both of your fellow new mods have an extensive background in iOS and the greater Apple community and a great history in helping others out with technical issues.

Speaking of community issues, **are there any complaints or concerns from you all?** [bmeckel](http://www.reddit.com/user/bmeckel) and I have been taking a more active role when it comes to spam, which has led to having repeat offenders banned as well as a banned list of websites. Are we going too far? Not far enough?

We've made a few significant changes to the sidebar over the last few months, and especially over the last week. Hopefully now, the sidebar should be easier to read for newbies as well as making announcements from us a bit more visible, like the announcement calling for **custom CSS**.

Yes, that's right! **We're putting a call out for custom CSS!** bmeckel, the other mods, and I do our best to make this a nice place to talk about iPhone/iOS and encourage community, but we (I) don't know a darn thing about CSS.

iphone,"I've just downgraded my ""Twitter For iPhone"" app from 3.3 back to the 3.2.2 version to get rid of that stupid, invasive ""Trends"" bar; here's (roughly) how","After a couple of days of it, I was sick and tired of the new ""Twitter Trends"" bar in the newly-updated Twitter For iPhone app (v 3.3). In the past I've tried other apps to use on my iPod Touch for accessing my Twitter account, and I like EchoPhone and Tweetdeck best of all the rest, but I honestly do prefer the official Twitter app the most.  Just not with this new (ahem) ""improvement"". And I'm not jailbroken, and I don't want to mess with that...certainly not just for this reason! So I set out to find a way to go back to the old version (v 3.2.2) of the Twitter for iPhone app.

I can't even be sure I can tell you =exactly= how I did it, because there was a lot of trial and error involved.  So anything I say below should be taken with a bit of a grain of salt. Still, I think this will point you in the right direction, if you want to look into doing it yourself.  This is on a PC machine; Mac users may get some benefit out of this write-up, but I cannot guarantee anything.  Make sure your unit is NOT hooked up to your computer for syncing before you get started.

I began by looking in my Windows (Vista) recycle bin, and found the old version of ""Twitter.ipa"" which was in there (if you don't have this file, then the rest of the process won't work). Before doing anything with it, though, I looked at the directory it had been deleted from, and opened up that directory.  I found the new version of the app, which was called ""Twitter 1.ipa"" (note that there's a space between the ""r"" and the ""1""), and renamed it ""Twitter 1.bak"".  Next I restored the deleted ""Twitter.ipa"" file and renamed it ""Twitter 1.ipa"".

From there I went into iTunes and found the Twitter app in my list of apps, and it had an exclamation mark to the left of the app name because it could not find the file associated with the app.  So I right-clicked on it, where it explained that it couldn't find the file, and asked me if I wanted to locate the file manually.  I said yes, and then found the new (old?) ""Twitter 1.ipa"" file I had just fixed up.

After that, I made sure that iTunes showed the app was checkmarked as being included on my iPod Touch after the next sync, and then I deleted the Twitter app from my actual iPod Touch. I then hooked the unit up to my PC for syncing, and synced it.  When done, I had to log back into the Twitter app with my Twitter username and password, but all was well.  AND THERE WAS NO MORE TRENDS BAR!

Again, there was a lot of trial-and-error involved surrounding what I just laid out, but to my knowledge the above-described steps were the necessary portions of the process.  Also, be aware that the app will be flagged as needing an update whenever you visit the App Store with your unit, or the appropriate place in iTunes.  You'll just have to ignore that, and resist the temptation to ""update all"".  Oh, I'm sure I can adjust to that!  ;)

I hope this helps somebody out there.",25,25,2011-03-05,AAPL,0.058458901941776276,0.9062955379486084,0.035245608538389206

(if anyone is interested I can make this a series)","I'm out travelling for about a month and decided not to bring my laptop this time. I have a 16gb iPad and this is the first time I've brought it anywhere without knowing that I will have a constant Internet connection.
I'm a freelancer in web design so going away without my normal set of tools (safari w. developer tools on, Transmit, BBEdit and terminal) is a little bit of a risk.


Preparation;
I've just discovered that 16 gb is extremely small. Luckily I'm bringing my iPhone too, so I deleted all music on my iPad. Instead I managed to get 23 episodes of a tv-series into it.
I also found out that my local library ""lends"" e-book that automatically deletes after 28 days. Getting them into my iPad wasn't very easy but I got 6 books in too. (if you have a Swedish library card and want to know how to get them into the iPad, just ask, i can write a guide).

Day 1-4
Hostel in Istanbul - Internet is sloooooow. Decided to get a tabbed browser, usually safari works fine, but waiting for a page to load is boring. [iLunascape](http://www.lunascape.tv/iLunascape.aspx) is free and works good. I'm ready to pay for a better tabbed browser, but why apple don't have this built in is a mystery.

Day 5, first problem.
Letter from a client, something in a CMS (content management system) isn't working.
Realizes that htmlbox (popular open source JavaScript text editor) doesn't work on iPad. 
This is really bad, first thing I have to do when I come home is to try to make a mobile version of this implementation

Day 6 - Abu dhabi airport. 
The skype app is for iPhone, but why on earth don't iPhone app rotate?
Find another JavaScript error on the iPad. My online service for sending SMS don't alert success - so I'm manage to send the same ""I'm ok"" message home six or seven times - making everybody really nervous :)

Still, no real problem with customers, I have [FTP on the go](http://www.ftponthego.com/) and Ssh but im not really looking forward to using it in a ""live"" situation.

- repeat steps again : doesn't work, no new icons on my phone, everything seems the same - double check just to be sure. reboot phone and check again : nothing.

- download a diff app (greenpoison), follow directions like mr wizard : doesn't work

- decide to give up, restore backup to phone just in case something got changed

- first backup restore : fail

apple,I absolutely HATE to admit this!,"I put a [Zagg Full Body Cover,](http://www.zagg.com/invisibleshield/apple-iphone-4-cases-screen-protectors-covers-skins-shields.php) minus the front as I don't like the feel of it on the screen.  Well the part that covers the silent switch on the side of the iPhone moved around a bit and got some sticky stuff inside the switch.  The switch still worked, but didn't have that ""feel"" anymore and just didn't make me happy.

After reading stories on here about how helpful the Genius Bar is, I decided to make an appointment for yesterday and see if they could open it up and clean it for me.  When I get called up, the ""Genius"" asks what's wrong with my iPhone, and I tell him.  I also told him that it was MY fault it was like that, and I asked if he could clean it somehow.  He said ""Unfortunately, we can't open it up and clean it, do you have your data backed up?""  I said ""yeah, I sync at least once a day and it backs up then.""  He then said ""OK, I'll be right back, I'll go get you a new iPhone.""  I was floored, so I told him ""you don't have to, it's my fault.""  He then said something that floored me and made me a customer for life ""I understand, but you paid a lot of money for your phone, and you want it to work the way it did when you bought it, and we want you to be happy with our products and fully enjoy them no matter what.""  

Ten minutes later I walked out of the store with a new iPhone.  I used to HATE Apple, but I guess you can say I drank the Kool-Aid.  Their support is top notch!",105,142,2011-03-11,AAPL,0.028461435809731483,0.9208899140357971,0.050648681819438934

After you do that, you put the sim card in an iPhone 4 or 3GS or whatever you have and you can either way a few hours for AT&amp;T to recognize that you are using a different phone or just call AT&amp;T and tell them you have a new phone, you will be grandfathered in for Unlimited data.

apple,After the Quake at the Apple Store in Tokyo.,"The founder of Digg, Kevin Rose recently received an e-mail from a friend working at an Apple Store in Tokyo, Japan, detailing the steps that Apple employees took right after the devastating 8.9 earthquake that struck last Friday afternoon. His friend details how the staff stayed calm as the building swayed and how they led people from the top five floors of the building, down to the first floor where they took shelter under the large wooden display tables that are a staple at every Apple Store in the world. As the earthquake hit these tables offered everyone protection from potential injury. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported at this Apple Store location.

The Apple Store is one of the few places in Tokyo that offers customers free Wi-Fi service, so people flocked to the store to contact family members. Apple employees not only kept the store open, but the staff brought out surge protectors and extension cords to help people keep their devices charged and running. They also offered assistance to few Android users as well. Even after the store closed at 10pm, people crowded around outside the store to use it’s free Wi-Fi, long into the night. Although the store closed at 10pm, some employees stayed up until 3am helping people stay in contact with their relatives and also offering tech support when needed.

The e-mail goes on to say, “Because the trains and phones were down, almost everyone who worked in Tokyo was stranded deep in the city. All the hotels were booked, the roads were jammed, so hundreds of people were instantly homeless. Apple told all of their staff - Retail AND Corporate - that they could go sleep at the Apple stores. The Senior managers at the stores had been notified earlier and unbeknownst to us, had gone out to stock up on food and drinks after the very first quake hit.”

The Apple store in Tokyo continues to offer help connecting friends and relatives to one another during this difficult time. With so much devastation all around them, just knowing that family members are alive and well can make all the difference in the world.

If we don't hear from you, we'll plan to automatically enroll you into DataPro 4GB after March 27, 2011. The new plan – whether you sign up on your own or we automatically enroll you – will replace your current smartphone data plan, including if you are on an unlimited data plan.

If you discontinue tethering, no changes to your current plan will be required.

It's easy to track your usage throughout the month so there are no bill surprises. For example, we send you free text messages when you reach 65, 90, and 100 percent of your plan's threshold. If you would like to monitor your account more closely, go to www.att.com/dataplans to learn about other ways to track your data usage.

As a reminder, our smartphone data plans also include unlimited usage of Wi-Fi at no additional charge. AT&amp;T smartphone customers can use Wi-Fi at home or on-the-go at any one of our more than 23,000 U.S. hotspots already included in your data plan.

Thank you for bringing your account up to date. We appreciate the opportunity to continue to serve your mobile broadband needs.

Sincerely,

AT&amp;T

When I was done, I thought I'd listen to music on my iPhone for a bit while I work, so I just pressed play.

Suddenly, sounds from my game (from 20 min prior) start playing on my iPhone for about 15 seconds and stops... I press play again and it's just the last song I was listening to from the day before.

iphone,AT&amp;T asked if I would recommend them to my Friends and Colleagues.  This is what I said:,"Just a note to give the reader some context. I am a computer consultant that uses a wide range of technologies for both fun and profit. You might call me an early adopter. I subscribe to AT&amp;T's U-Verse cable/internet product, and use AT&amp;T for my family's cell phones. AT&amp;T asked if I would recommend them in a survey after I bought a phone from their store (the Atrix, the dual core Android smart phone from Motorola; the IPhone 4 was a *really* close second choice). This is what I said:

&gt;AT&amp;T is actively putting into place ~~bandwidth restrictions~~ data limits (both mobile and on the U-Verse platform (which we also use)) that are completely unacceptable. We can avoid some of these ~~bandwidth restrictions~~ data limits by sticking with 3G coverage and thus hold onto our grandfathered unlimited plan, but that isn't going to last very long. AT&amp;T is moving to a pseudo-4G (some might call it a Faux G) architecture for data. To use the ""Faux-G"" access, ~~I have to drop the unlimited 3G plan I have, and suck on the data limits on the new ""Faux-G"". And what limits they are! 2G per month download, or about half an hour of HD Video which my new Atrix smart phone can play over HDMI to my TV~~. {*See note2 below*}

&gt;So in the very near future, I have to give up on the idea of downloading content over your wireless network on to my phone.

&gt;This leaves me to downloading over my home network, which uses AT&amp;T U-verse. You have just announced restrictions on downloading over THAT network to 250G starting in May. The restrictions on the U-Verse are particularly galling, as new technologies and new business models depend on delivering content over the Internet. Where we once might have avoided the phone data limits by using our home wireless, the increasing restrictions on our wireless (U-Verse) makes us very nervous.

&gt;AT&amp;T is a business, and as such it is understandable that their priority is to their investors. It is also understandable that customers (who have few if any other options) are very low in priority. But you asked why we wouldn't recommend AT&amp;T to a friend or colleague. Well, I WOULD recommend them to invest in AT&amp;T, but would NOT recommend them to become an AT&amp;T customer unless they absolutely had no other choice. This is the best alignment one can take to match AT&amp;T's priorities. (Cross posted to Reddit.com)

**note:** Do not think that I am suggesting to my friends that they should invest in AT&amp;T.  This was intended as sarcasm.

**note2:  I WAS WRONG** about what I have said in many replies about losing your unlimited 3G plan.  I called AT&amp;T and after a long conversation, they claimed you don't have to give up your unlimited plan to use AT&amp;T's new 4G thingy.  You do have to have your plan ""tweeked"" in some way, but you don't lose it.  But I was absolutely told I would lose it by the AT&amp;T salesman when I bought the new phone.

I just had to vent.. I was really excited about getting the iPad and suggesting it to others, but now I can't even advise friends and family to get the iPad now. Without that it feels so crippled--at least for photo needs.

The charger and battery work properly.  I think there must be some corrosion on a circuit so it doesn't charge.


Thanks for the upvotes!  You guys made me feel a little better about the situation.  I made an appointment for the Genius Bar last night and I'm going to bring my little baby over there.  There was a lot of chipping on the case and such, so I'm going to try and see if I can get that fixed and see what they have to say.

Turns out that it was just a broken charger!  False alarm.  I went in and said that I was coming in to replace the chipped parts of the MacBook.  They are repairing that for free, and they are also giving me a new charger.  It will cost me $61 total!

I created this because I've been addicted to similar games in the past, and I was surprised at the lack of real-time games in the App Store. Sometimes playing with other people is just more fun :)

apple,"It's shit like this, Apple...wow.","My roommate had been pondering getting a new compute for a few weeks, humming and hawing over which model, brand, etc... mostly because of lacks of funds. Finally she settled for a smaller 300$ netbook, mainly something to get by on during her last year at University.

Well, her dad decided to surprise her and bought her a brand new Macbook pro for her birthday before she can get the other cpu, and she is so excited!

Fast forward about 3 weeks later, she is working on her homework on her new Macbook and our cat comes along. Now our cat has a weird tendency of 1. moving her water bowl around and 2. knocking over cups of water. We don't understand why, but we accept and love her regardless, yes... even the slow ones need love.

So the kitty comes along and does what she does best, and knocks over a whole cup of water on the mac, which auto shuts-off to protect itself. My roommate was away no more than 10 seconds, and her brand new macbook was ruined. She left it off for 3 days and tried to start it to no avail (which surprised me). Obviously this is the point where she breaks down and cries because she realizes that letting it dry didn't fix it, and that she has to tell her dad she ruined her birthday present, which was such a good surprise.

So she brings it to a computer store first (not the apple store) and the guy opens it up and right away says the feared words ""water damage"" and sends her along her way. She figures she is shit out of luck, decides to hit up the apple store anyways in case she can replace a single part, or maybe they have a tip for her, somehow.

The guy at the genius bar takes the laptop out back, hums, haws, finally coming up to her and asking what exactly had happened around the time when the laptop stopped working. At this point she figures she has hit her wall, and tears start coming to her eyes. So anyways, the apple guy givers her a new one. wait WHAT?! Yeah, he says ""well, this is gonna be on your file, so it won't probably happen again, but we're gonna replace it this time, ok?"" and just friggin' gives her a new one.

This doesn't happen in todays world, I used to work at Future shop and we did everything to weasel our way out of most repairs and replacements, and the apple store just GIVES her a new laptop even thought they don't need to? 

My hat is off to you Apple, you've made 3 new lifelong customers with that one replacement, and I take back everything I said about you.

Also I realize that apple can most likely repair/refurb the unit so they won't lose that much out of it, but still, this meant the world to my roommate, thanks Apple!

TL/DR: Brand new macbook pro as a bday gift dies because of water damaged and apple replaces it.

iphone,"I finally updated fapstack.com – now serving content posted to /r/nsfw, etc.","Hello everyone, I'm the creator of [FAPSTACK](http://fapstack.com) – basically a mobile-browser oriented sexy pics website. The concept is to allow very fast and easy access to pics that can easily be controlled ***with one hand*** ;)

Anyhow, originally I added content manually when I found pics I liked, but I thought it would be more exciting to make it a bit more 'live'. So now, it scrapes content from a few pic-related reddits, such as /r/nsfw, /r/ass, etc.

I'd like to point out that it doesn't steal bandwidth. It downloads the files once, processes them (resize), and stores them on its server.

At the moment, it's on a 24-hour automatic update schedule, with old pics removed from the list once they are a week old (once they're no longer in the top 200 or so posts).

Give it a try! It's optimized for iPhone at the moment, but probably works equally well with most smartphones.

I'm also open to suggestions with regard to what other URLs I could add to the scraper.

[FAPSTACK](http://fapstack.com) is my community service. I make absolutely no money from it. Enjoy!",10,27,2011-03-31,AAPL,0.020328301936388016,0.9246504306793213,0.0550212487578392
