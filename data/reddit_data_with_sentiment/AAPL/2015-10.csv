iphone,"Hey iPhone lovers. A few years ago I helped design Draw Something. Then I lost my job, and was out of the game industry for a while. I spent the past year developing a new game all by myself. Now it's out and you can download it for free. AMA.","My new game is called [No More Kings](http://montoyaindustries.com/nomorekings/) and it's a unique puzzle game based on Chess. The idea is that you have to solve a path puzzle to capture the king, using standard chess pieces, and on your way to the king you have to eliminate all the other pieces on the board first. 

I built the game in Cordova (PhoneGap) with HTML5 &amp; jQuery. The first 50 levels are free, and additional level packs are available for $0.99 each. There are no ads. I plan to add more level packs soon (including more free packs) and I will add more variations to the game mechanics, so it won't just be more of the same :)

I came up with the idea when a friend gave me a chess set as a gift. I've always liked chess but I'm terrible at it. I don't play because I always lose. But I was looking at this set one day and came up with the idea to make something new out of it. It was also inspired by one of my favorite puzzle games, [Neko Puzzle](http://www.lexaloffle.com/neko.php). 

I spent, honestly, over a year working on this. It's not because I'm a slow developer, it's because this was a side project for most of the time. And in the early months I struggled with trying to make the game automagically generate puzzles; it wasn't until I realized I was better off manually designing puzzles that I was really able to make progress. But it felt good to get back into designing games and honestly these first few days since I released it has given me renewed hope for my chances as an indie developer. 

[The webpage](http://montoyaindustries.com/nomorekings/) has a fully playable demo and you can download the game for iPhone and Android. Below is some press coverage. Thank you for taking a look and reading this far!

apple,"I have purchased the new MacBook 12"" and am deeply unsatisfied. Is there anything I can do?","**Edit 2: I want you to know that I updated to El Captain and it seems much better for now. It feels like a whole new computer. I can't replicate my own video anymore. If it stays quick and responsible, that goes from worst to best computer I ever had. Thank you for letting me know about it, I wasn't even aware OSX had an update.**

~~

I purchased it in Rio de Janeiro / Brazil. I am deeply unsatisfied with the machine. The shape, the keyboard, the trackpad, the screen, the speaker, the weight, the battery life - everything is better than I could ever expect. But the thing is slow. Slow, to a point it is ridiculous. It takes a second to switch a Safari tab. It takes 1 second to merely highlight the URL bar. It struggles with as few as 4 open tabs. Some sites such as google maps are, simply, unusable. Often I experience 5 second or so delays where the whole OS is unresponsible. The actual performance when compiling and running code is actually quite nice - but the usability of the system is atrocious. I'm not talking about 3D games and the like, I'm talking about simple usage. This $1600 machine - 2 months worth of a lawyer's income where I live - feels worse than Windows 98 under a pentium 1.

I would sell my old MPBr to use this one, but with that performance I'll have to keep it. Is there anything I can do? Can I get my money back?

apple,YSK there are already Content Blockers available for OS X Safari,"So [in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3nc5j2/so_which_safari_content_block_extension_i_should/cvmqbf2) I mentioned how there's no Content Blocker on the Mac yet, but one cunning linguist kindly pointed me to a [Safari engineer's tweet](https://twitter.com/rmondello/status/649671097655275520), and apparently some of them have already sneaked into the Extensions Gallery!

A quick non-scientific test led me to decide Adamant is the best of those four (fastest page loading + most data saved). Not a surprise since it's also [one of the fastest on iOS](https://brooksreview.net/2015/09/update-334_71/) ([newer review with even more CBs](https://brooksreview.net/2015/09/update-334_71/)).

What's more, since I'm already using uBlock, I decided to give them a quick comparison. Technically speaking, CBs *should* outperform JS-based ad blocking extensions like uBlock in both speed and resource required since Safari handles the blocking natively, but of course it also depends heavily on how good your list is. 

Judging from my most-visited sites, I can safely say Adamant is mostly as good as, if not slightly better than uBlock looking at the numbers shown in the Web Inspector. In reality, I'm not sure if it's placebo, page load does seem even SNAPPIER™ than with uBlock. Only downside is the lack of customisability to add more lists or custom rules (IIRC it's possible with the API, Adamant just doesn't have it currently), but overall I'm impressed!

I'd like to invite you guys to give them a try, and [keep an eye on the Extensions Gallery](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/en-us/?category=mostrecent) for more CBs to come.",59,154,2015-10-04,AAPL,0.029759053140878677,0.9276719093322754,0.04256904125213623

apple,I just received the best customer service from Apple,"This happened a few weeks ago.

As many of you already know, Apple had issued a repair program for 2011 Macbook Pros due to logic board issues. I had to replace my logic board 3 times in the span of a year. My laptop failed one more time and, with school starting again, I couldn't deal with it anymore.

I went to the closest Apple store and explained my problem. They did their diagnosis, determined it was a faulty logic board they game me, and then went into the back room for twenty minutes. The employee came back out, apologized, and said that they can repair my laptop again for free, or...slowly pulls out a new 2015 15 inch Macbook Pro... they can replace it with a brand new one.

I was stunned. This was a $3000 laptop they just handed to me. I have never received such great customer service.",389,1215,2015-10-07,AAPL,0.1262257993221283,0.8040159344673157,0.06975828111171722

apple,My Mac Mini order was cancelled by Apple because an update is expected soon,"We ordered a Mac Mini for me at work 3 weeks ago. The delivery date kept being pushed back (since it has 16Gb RAM it's a custom made order) until today where we received a text from Apple. The order has been canceled because a update of this product is expected soon (they encourage us to place another order later).

I'm just posting that here so you know (it seems you can still buy a Mac Mini that's in stock, but if I were you I would just wait a few weeks). It's worth noting that I'm in France we ordered online on the french Apple website.

**Edit:** Some people are asking that I post a screenshot of the text. I honestly wasn't expecting:

- the whole thing to be something out of the ordinary
- so many people answering and being surprised

The text was received by my boss, I didn't read it. When he told me about it he said he deleted it manually. I'll ask tomorrow again if he's sure of what he read and if somehow he can still retrieve the text to check it again.

**Edit 2:** I had a discussion with my 2 bosses involved in ordering the Mac and the exact reason was (in the email, in french) ""Reconstruction de gamme"" (which means something like ""rebuilding the range [of Mac Minis I guess]"").

And yes, Apple did cancel the order (weird indeed), my boss got a refund and got told (by email) that he can either order something not custom (in stock) or either wait to be recontacted later by Apple.

Another hint that something is happening is that when you order on the website (at least on the french store), a fully maxed Mac Mini is advertised to be delivered in **2-3 days** but when you do the ""delivery date simulation"" (or whatever you call it in english) it actually goes to **16-20 October!** (see the screenshot below for proof)

http://imgur.com/XD9tFqY

Try it yourself if you don't believe me: http://www.apple.com/fr/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini?product=MGEN2F/A&amp;step=config#

So you can order something in stock straigthaway but as soon as you want something custom you have crazy delays.

And no I didn't ask to see the email, I do trust them (they wouldn't be the kind of people to lie about that, and one is quite a follower of Apple news and very surprised and intrigued about that too). They even offered to re-order today (for delivery on 16-20 Oct) or even order one that's in stock, but I'd rather wait a week or too and see (I don't want to miss any update).",209,319,2015-10-07,AAPL,0.13385319709777832,0.8381118774414062,0.02803494594991207

mac,"After 1.5 months, AppleCare has cut contact with me following a faulty MacBook Pro repair","http://imgur.com/a/mWXPk

I have a 2012 maxed out MacBook Pro I've been using for a long time that started to encounter some GPU issues (mainly flickering on the iGPU) towards the end of it's AppleCare period. I figured no problem, AppleCare will take care of it and my computer will be back up and running in no time at all. 

The first visit I made to an Apple Store, they took my MacBook Pro, saw the issue, and said they'd take care of it. I get a call two days later to pick it up, only to find the issue is still there. Turns out they only reformatted the drive, but it was no problem as they owned up to the fact that the issue was still there, and sent it to the repair center for a hardware repair. I get it back a few days later with a new logic board and screen, and take a look at it. Now here's where the problem starts. 

Upon opening the screen I can already see that not only has the issue not been fixed, but it's actually much worse than it ever was before. The iGPU was seemingly working fine, but the discrete GPU (NVIDIA 650M 1024MB) was just completely messed up. Of course both the Apple Geniuses and I saw the problem, but they claimed there was nothing they could, and they gave me a phone number to contact AppleCare directly.

At this point, I've already been without a computer for almost a week, so I decide to contact the AppleCare support as soon as I can. The advisor asked me for a video of the problem and the Capture Data from the MacBook Pro, both of which I sent to him through Apple's file upload portal. After about a week or so of waiting, he finally calls me while I'm at work, and leaves a voicemail saying that after taking a look at the video he believes that my computer is within spec, and there's nothing he can do at this point. Here is the video I sent by the way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d_Vn10Fx_Y&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be I realize now that it wasn't the best way of demonstrating the issue, but it's visible in the video regardless, especially the pink patterns within the gradients.

After that, I decide to do some troubleshooting on my own to see if I can figure out how to solve the problem, starting with reformatting. After reformatting several times, I thought maybe my computer really is fine, so I call my friend over who has a similar MacBook Pro, though with a 512MB 650M rather than 1024MB, and we do a direct comparison. It was instantly apparent that my MacBook Pro was much worse than his to an undeniable point. The gradients weren't clean and there was clear artifacting around windows. Here is a video of the comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP0WE9dngg8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be

I decide to call and email my adviser again to send him this new information, but after well over a week of trying to get in contact with him, all my attempts are outright ignored. Last Wednesday (September 30) I call Apple Support and provide my case number, and they get me in contact with a new adviser, who sends me another link to send my video and Capture Data. She said that they will take 3-4 days to look at the data, but she will call me on Friday (October 2) no matter what just to keep me up to date. Yesterday, I decided to leave her a voicemail asking for an update, and her voicemail says she would call back within in 24 hours. It has now been just over 24 hours and I haven't received a response and she won't pick up her phone.

I'm really stumped at what to do about this. It's been over a month since the hardware repair that messed up the GPU and I still haven't gotten anywhere with support. I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong; I've been polite and understanding, despite all the delays, but I've never heard of AppleCare being this bad. I feel like I'm being outright ignored, and there's nothing I can do about it. All is I want is my computer to work the way it did before. Has anyone ever been a similar situation?

TL;DR: MBP had issues, sent for repair that made the issues worse, and AppleCare has been ignoring my phone calls while tossing me around to different advisers who end up also ignoring me

apple,The Surfacebook has been surprisingly popular on /r/apple and other Apple-related subs. Can this be real and representative of the /r/apple community?,"First, a disclaimer: The new Surfacebook and Surface 4 look awesome. I think it's great that Microsoft is getting serious about hardware and providing some much-needed competition for Apple. I'm an Apple fanboy, and I hate denigrating other platforms and in general think they all have awesome things to offer. I just prefer Apple. I also think it's super important to be critical of Apple, especially when it comes to working conditions for manufacturers and seeing through advertising doublespeak. 

That being said, I'm a little surprised at the reaction to the Surfacebook. There are over 1500 comments on the announcement thread in /r/apple ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3npv7p/microsoft_surface_book_claimed_to_be_twice_as/)). Comment after comment is something along the lines of ""I'm switching"" ""MS is the new Apple"" ""The MacBook/iPad Pro is dead"" etc etc etc. 

I'm in an Apple sub. Like I said, I'm all for competition and think it's great that MS has improved drastically since the says of Balmer and Windows 8. But when did we become an MS Surface advertisement?  I don't feel like I'm getting a very real view from genuine Apple fans. 

Anyways, maybe I'm paranoid, but I can't help but sense the creep of advertisers into reddit (and this wouldn't only apply to MS). 

Anyways, just wanted to point that out.

apple,For my Year 12 (Senior Year) Major Project I created an iPhone Design Concept. This is my Project Portfolio.,"[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/G6aO3)

I presented my portfolio alongside [Technical Drawings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3i83ditlibqp1jl/Technical%20Drawings.pdf?dl=0) [3MB PDF], and an iPad [showcasing the design](http://exploreiphone.tumblr.com).

I thought someone may find it interesting.

**EDIT: More Information**

I probably exceeded the expectations for the amount of work put into the project, I also made wooden prototypes of my design and the iPhone 5s (for comparison) that I cut with a CNC machine, and printed a few A2 Posters for my display. This was alongside the two A3 Booklets &amp; an iPad displaying the website.

I got a 98 mark, which is around the top 0.2% in Australia and got invited to an Expo to display my project.

Overall the project took about 7 months, with a brief period towards the middle where motivation was lacking. Unfortunately, some parts were rushed &amp; aren't as polished as I would like, namely the website &amp; a couple of pages in the portfolio.

Ok, I think you get my point. The results just keep going and it's really painful to read.

35 apps are bolded. So that's about 35% accuracy, and I'm being generous here, because a lot of these apps are complete rubbish.

***

There's a couple of things Apple could do to address the 1.5 million apps currently in the App Store:

- Hire 500 tech-savvy teenagers as contractors to go through 1.5 million apps. That's 3000 apps per person. If each person reviewed 30 apps per day (16 minutes per app), in 100 workdays, the entire team would be able to go through the entire store and re-organize it.
- This team could tag each app with relevant keywords, they could place each app into genuinely specific niche categories, they could request developers to change app names (see app #76 in the list), they could remove search ranking from apps that don't belong under those keywords.
- Team members could shadowban obviously spammy apps. These apps would still be available if you searched for them directly by name, but they would be automatically ranked lower in search results (always below the 30th result, for example). Any app that's shadowbanned will be internally marked with the team member's name, so that if there's ever any dispute, you have someone responsible.
- Team members could influence search results by having curated lists of specific app categories. This is a tricky line to hold to, but it can be done if each list is managed by a specific team member. It would it be wonderful if Twitter, Tweetbot, and Twitterrific were actually in the top results for the keyword ""Twitter"". Same goes for other specific categories (Password Manager apps, Note-taking apps, Converting Currency apps, Weather apps... imagine if you actually had relevant human-curated lists for each of those apps. Developers could apply to have their app included in a list; customers would also be able to recommend apps to add to a specific list.)

Yes, it would be a lot of work, and a lot of people to hire, even if only as contractors. But this is literally one of those problems that if you throw enough manpower at it, you would immediately improve the App Store by 50%. And if, afterwards, you throw some engineering and design power at this problem, you could implement processes to make sure future apps that are submitted are vetted correctly.

What I'm saying is: this is a solvable problem. The solution is actually doable. This problem is vast, yes, but it can be done. It's not enough to say ""There's 1.5 million apps, so obviously you can't human curate them all"". Actually we can. We can human curate them, and even if we human curate them crudely, it would still be better. We don't have to give up the algorithms doing the work for us (Google seems to manage pretty well with algorithms, at least with their search engine) but if some human curation is necessary to bring the App Store into order, then so be it.",66,247,2015-10-11,AAPL,0.046791555980841316,0.9145211974779764,0.03868726392587026

apple,Blown away by the 6S.,"Long term android user here. I've owned several phones over the years:
Motorola Backflip, Lumia 620, Galaxy S3, LG G2, HTC ONE M7, M8, IPhone 5(I couldn't stand the small screen and battery life), and the Galaxy S6. 

And I have to say the new 6S is simply mind-blowing and **almost** perfect. I've never used a phone this good and here are the reasons why:

- Zero Lag despite whatever you're doing. So buttery smooth. 
- Insane camera and I love Live photos despite everyone saying its a gimmick.
- Multitasking has been exactly what I had always wished for but been disappointed with all of my previous phones.
- UNDERRATED FEATURE! 3D touch in incredible when switching apps by swiping in from the side...its like swiping through a deck of cards.
- I thought I'd miss my Galaxy S6 AMOLED display but I've barely noticed that I'm using a screen that reviews say is just unacceptable at 720p.
- Everything just works. iCloud is a blessing.
- The size of the 6S is to this date, the best sized phone I have ever held. Not too big, not too small...JUST right. 

However there is one thing that's disappointing and that is the **battery life** . I wish they could've improved this but I think thats a compromise that is acceptable....for now.",251,204,2015-10-11,AAPL,0.041739363223314285,0.9153149724006653,0.04294571280479431

apple,Eating Humble Pie. The Apple Watch is pretty damn slick.,"I put down the Apple Watch pretty hard, at least based on my use cases, until this weekend. It's expensive, not necessary and to me, was more of a gimmick than anything else. 

My wife runs, a lot. Her Garmin just gave up after a year, and faced with spending another $200+, we looked at the Apple Watch since it can do much more, for not much more in the grand scheme of things. So I bought her a Rose Gold one. Of course, I couldn't be left out, so I got myself a Space Grey one as well. Figured I could try it out, if it wasn't for me, I'd return it.

apple,"Surface Book CPUs revealed, MacBook Pro comparison turns out to be deceptive","Microsoft made pretty bold statements and comparisons when they revealed the Surface Book last week, notably:

&gt; Ounce-for-ounce, pound-for-pound, this is the fastest 13-inch laptop ever made anywhere on any planet.

and aiming Apple directly:

&gt;2x more powerful than a MacBook Pro

Since we didn't know the exact CPU/GPU models used in the Surface Book, it was hard to tell how accurate those statements were. Some speculated that the high-end model might use an ULV quad-core chip.

The exact CPU models have now [been revealed](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2989906/laptop-computers/here-are-the-details-of-the-surface-book-and-surface-pro-4-chips-and-why-they-matter.html):

*  Core i5-6300U (Dual-core ULV, 15W TDP, 2.4-GHz, Intel HD graphics 520)
*  Core i7-6600U (Dual-core ULV, 15W TDP, 2.6-GHz, Intel HD graphics 520)

It turns out the first statement is not true, while the MacBook Pro comparison is somewhat true, but highly misleading.

The only metric in which the Surface Book beats the MacBook Pro is when you compare graphics performance of the high-end Surface Book with dGPU to the 13"" rMBP (with integrated graphics).

That's a weird comparison given that the price of a Surface Book with dGPU falls more in line with the price of a 15"" rMBP. In fact, the 15"" rMBP with dGPU is $200 cheaper than a Surface Book with dGPU and equivalent RAM / storage, while also having a much faster CPU (quad-core 47W) and being volumetrically smaller.

So if we compare products that actually fall in a similar price range, we find out that:

* A 13"" rMBP has better CPU **and** GPU performance than a similarly-priced Surface Book.
* A 15"" rMBP has much better CPU performance than a similarly-priced Surface Book. We can't tell about the GPU until Microsoft reveals the exact dGPU used in the Surface Book, which some speculate is a custom design.",363,281,2015-10-13,AAPL,0.043348923325538635,0.9123722910881042,0.04427875205874443

Tired, I picked up my 2013 Moto X and said 'Ok Google Now, play Fergie's The Dutchess album.' Got it on the first try.

I can't say what are the limitations Apple is facing with Siri, but they need to up their game ASAP. I find myself very wary of using Siri because there is a great chance she can't pick up a slightly more challenge command and I don't want to feel like a talking idiot. And while I'm at this, let me say that there is no way I would buy an Apple watch if this is what I am getting with their voice recognition.

apple,Picked up a magic trackpad 2... Here are my thoughts.,"I picked up a magic trackpad 2 and as a longtime magic trackpad user I thought I'd add my thoughts to the fray.

First up, yes, it's expensive. Almost hilariously expensive... This thing is definitely a luxury item, but I'll do my best to help justify the cost as I go here.

As many of you know, the first big difference is the size. This thing is significantly bigger than the magic trackpad 1, but what most people don't mention is it's actually only larger in the horizontal dimension:

http://i.imgur.com/ZQKwxbX.jpg

In the vertical, the trackpad space is almost identical. You can see here how the original magic trackpad stacks up, with the ""touchable"" surface ending at the battery cylinder:

http://i.imgur.com/yBCBvYR.jpg

Height wise, it's significantly lower profile, although when you line them up side by side the actual trackpad surface is only mildly different in slope.

http://i.imgur.com/BIJWfCp.jpg

So, is the difference noticeable?

Yes. The increased width was immediately noticeable for me. I usually maintain a slightly slower mouse tracking speed, and having the extra width means I can get from one side of the screen to the other extremely comfortably without lifting a finger. It definitely feels a bit more natural than the original magic trackpad. It's also nice when you're doing 4-finger gestures, like swiping between desktop spaces. There's a lot more space to work with.

The slope difference isn't very noticeable. The fact that it is lower profile and generally shorter doesn't really change the feel of the device. The face of the trackpad however definitely feels different than the original magic trackpad. I'm having a hard time describing it, but the original trackpad was very slick and cool to the touch. The new magic trackpad 2 is a bit more soft-touch. It feels nice on the fingertip, although I don't really have a preference in terms of touch-feel.

One place where the new trackpad definitely excels is it's absolutely rock-solid hold on my desk. Pressing down on my old trackpad, I can easily cause the entire device to wiggle a bit on my desk. The new magic trackpad stays -exactly- where I put it, even while shoving all over the trackpad with significant force. The feet on this thing grip much, much better than the old device, and it's not going to move around while you try to force-touch it. Even lifting it up feels more solid. The entire device is just one hard solid slab, and it feels extremely nice as a result.

One final nice little thing to note - **the Magic Trackpad 2 lines up significantly better with my pro wired mac keyboard** (with the number pad):

http://i.imgur.com/AYEbwym.jpg

This is nice, because the old magic trackpad didn't line up well at all. These two devices almost look made for each other. It's a nice fit for my desk. The downside? It doesn't line up quite as well with an original wireless mac keyboard.

**Setup...**

Setup was easy. Pull it out, turn it on, plug it into the mac with the lightning cable and it's instantly paired. Yank the cable and you're done. It's a ten second process, and eight of those ten seconds are spent trying to plug the usb cable into the back of your iMac. For the record, you can also use the trackpad with bluetooth OFF as long as it's plugged in with the lightning cable. So, you could use this thing as a wired trackpad without bluetooth if you felt so inclined. I'm not sure why you'd do that, but it's an option.

**Moving on to clicking...** 

The magic trackpad 2 is better, hands down.

You can click at any point on the face of this thing with the same ease, right up to the corners. That's a big contrast to the old device, where clicking near the top end of the trackpad face was significantly harder than clicking at the bottom edge.

I went in and almost immediately reduced the click force to the lowest possible setting. I felt force-click required too much pressure at the mid or firm settings, but at the low-end it is very comfortable to use. The feel of the regular click is definitely different than the magic trackpad, but not in a bad way. I know it's a ""haptic"" click (a fake click), but much like the new MacBooks, it is ""real"" enough that I don't notice it. It feels like you're clicking the trackpad, except you can click it anywhere and it feels exactly the same. Nice. 

The regular click does make a clicking sound that emanates from the trackpad itself. I'm guessing they have some kind of speaker in there. I went ahead and turned this clicking sound off, and the result was quite joyous. The feel of a convincingly real click with complete silence to go with it. It's fantastic. Previously, I used tap-to-click to avoid the clicking noises, but there are times when a regular click are useful (such as selecting text or dragging something). Yes, I know I can do it with 3 finger taps etc, but still, silent clicks = blissful. It just feels right.

The deep-press force clicks are nice for browsing etc, although you could emulate the feature by using 3-finger clicks on the old trackpad. Even so, in the small time I've had this I've noticed myself using the force-click more often than I ever used a 3 finger tap. I guess it just feels more natural to give the trackpad a forceful click to peek into content. It's especially nice browsing reddit, since force-click opens up the story you are looking at in a new sub-window, ready to be browsed and quickly returned from. I've been getting used to having this feature on my 2015 macbook pro, and it's nice to finally have it on my desktop to unify the experience.

**Final thoughts...**

All in all, I like the device. I like how easy it is to pair with my computer. You can do it manually, or you can just plug it into a lightning cable and bam, it's wirelessly paired and you can yank the cable. I like the fact that it's rechargeable without having to swap out batteries. I like the feel of the device and how solid it sits on my desk. I love how it looks next to my pro keyboard and I enjoy how the extra width makes the device just a bit more comfortable to use than the old model. I love the ability to have silent clicking and force-touch, and I love that I can click on every square inch of this slab without any difference in force required. It's a very comfortable experience.

**The verdict...**

If you loved the magic trackpad 1, you'll love the new one. It's a fantastic little device. The changes made are natural and comfortable, and it absolutely feels like a premium product experience. It just works exactly how you expect it to, better than any trackpad I've ever used (even better than my macbook, since this trackpad is so much larger). I'm willing to pay for a premium experience, and the Magic Trackpad 2 delivers.",144,217,2015-10-15,AAPL,0.031116541475057602,0.9172659516334534,0.05161750316619873

iphone,Made the switch to the 6s Plus from Galaxy S5. My thoughts after more than 5 years with Android.,"I never thought I would get an iPhone.  I've been a staunch Android defender for some time now.  I had the Droid X, Galaxy S3, and Galaxy S5 all on release day.  Recently, my S5 has grown slow and laggy.  I credit this to being on a platform where the OS is updated for the thousands of Android devices, but never optimized for any individual one of them.  I know that Apple isn't immune to this - I own a 4th gen iPad, and iOS 9 has slowed it down considerably.  Still, I used this reasoning as my main justification for wanting to switch.  With just two phone (regular and plus) releasing each year, surely they would be better optimized.


My plan was to buy the phone from the Apple Store using the new upgrade program.  I wasn't completely sold on the idea of Apple Care +, but my Galaxy was still on contract with Verizon, and this seemed like the most reasonable option.  For a full week, I woke up at 8AM trying to reserve a 6s Plus at one of the two Apple stores near me, but it was never available.  I ended up at a Best Buy where they had one 6s Plus left - the 64GB Space Gray version that I wanted.  I decided to buy it outright.  It was hard to fork over almost $1,000 for a piece of technology that I absolutely didn't need, but my thought my process is that I will try to tell it when the 7 is out, and I might be able to come out a little bit ahead compared to the in-store Apple upgrade program.



Instead of a full on review, I'll go through some individual things that stood out to me over the last week.


**Fingerprint Sensor:** This absolutely blew me away.  The first time I used it, I thought that something was wrong.  I touched my thumb to the start button to get to the screen where I enter my PW, but the phone just opened.  I went to settings to see if I needed to enable a code on the lock screen, but everything looked fine.  I hit the lock button, and tried it again.  That's when I realized that it was able to scan my finger so quickly that I didn't even notice it doing it.  This still fascinates me even a week later.  The Galaxy S5 needed a specific finger swipe gesture which barely ever worked - so I disabled it early on.  I'm sure that the S6 has improved that tech, but I can't imagine it being on this level.  Not having to enter a code or swipe a pattern has immensely increased how I enjoy my phone.


**Speed:** There's not much to say about the speed of the phone that hasn't already been said.  It's fast.  It made me realize that my S5 was getting so slow that it was almost a chore to use.  This is how a phone should work.


**Applications:** Every application that I've used on both phones now feels way superior on the iPhone.  It's extremely obvious that app developers care more about their product on iPhone than on Android. 


**Camera:** The camera takes unbelievably good pictures.  Live photos are a blast! (Side note - Does anyone else think that Live Photos would be more interesting if they *didn't* include sound?  I feel like this would help complete the ""Harry Potter"" type picture effect.  With sound, they just seem like short videos.)  I like that within the camera app, I don't need to worry about selecting a resolution.  It's just a more simplified and refined experience that takes great photos.  That being said - it does seem silly to me that in video mode I can't switch from 1080P to 4K within the camera app.  Having to go all the way back through the main settings doesn't seem like the best way of handling this.


**Other Misc. Thoughts:** The size of the phone is perfect for me.   The Plus is still usable one handed.  Last night I accidentally discovered that double tapping (not pressing) the home button brings the top half of the screen down so that you can reach the top with your thumb while using one hand.  I find this to be an amazing addition, and doing that quick double tap is becoming second nature to me.


I used the phone uncovered for a two full days, and I was always terrified of dropping it.  It feels slippery and like it has no grip.  It does not feel as sturdy as my S5 did.  I began looking for a case, but searching through Amazon was difficult.  It seems like most companies have not released new cases specifically for the new 6s series, and searching through the negative reviews on the cases showed people's cases breaking under the pressure of the slightly larger 6s compared to the 6.


I went to the Apple Store to look at their cases.  I ended up purchasing the 6s leather case.  At $50, it is *considerably* over-priced for what it is.  That being said, I would buy it again.

apple,Is anyone else getting sick of Google trying to impose its own UI standards into iOS?,"I'm finding lately that I've been using Google's apps less and less because they've been increasingly annoying me, thanks to Google's total stylistic disregard for iOS norms.

The lack of a back swipe, the design and placement of buttons, the share sheet menu, the overly flashy and downright obtrusive Material Design style, and so on - are becoming so obtrusive and so out-of-place in iOS, that frankly, I don't enjoy using Google's apps or services anymore.

I get that Google wants its design language to be universal, so it's trying to keep things consistent with Android's design language. But when you consider the fact that Google actually makes more money from iOS than it does from Android (iOS users tend to be far more lucrative), this recent overly assertive design style seems like a bad idea, as it only serves to push away iOS users.

Are you as turned off as I am by the way Google is thumbing its nose at iOS's stylists norms? Do you also hate the way that Google's products on iOS are increasingly sticking out like a sore thumb?",457,440,2015-10-19,AAPL,0.2878648340702057,0.6857661008834839,0.026369070634245872

apple,Siri. Am I missing something?,"New iPhone user here. Well, I've had one for 11 months anyway. Life-long Mac user and Apple fan, but I had Windows Phones prior to this 5S.  

Anyway, Siri seems to have fallen short of my expectations. I decided to go to At&amp;T yesterday to check out the iPhone 6S+ because I'm thinking about upgrading this year. Tried it out, the screen is amazing and the Force Touch thing is very cool. While I was there, I tried the newish Windows Phone and played with Cortana for the first time.. and holy crap it is cool.  

I want Siri to do the same things, but it doesn't seem anywhere near as fast, powerful or sophisiticated. The guy at the store demoed Cortana for me on his own phone. He said ""The next time I  talk to my brother, remind me to mention mom's birthday"".  Cortana understood him on the first try and responded quickly and said ""Ok, next time you talk to (brothers name) I will remind you"". So it knew who his brother was based on his address book entry, and it knew to remind him the next time either he called his brother or his brother called him!  

One of the other things he showed me was he said ""The next time I'm at the supermarket, remind me to get milk, eggs and bread"".  Again, Cortana responded instantly (in about 1/2 the time Siri usually takes to react for me) and said ""There is a Publix supermarket 1.2 miles from  your location. Do you mean this supermarket or a different one?"" And it had a list of all the supermarkets in the area to choose from. He responded by saying ""Any supermarket"". Then Cortana said ""OK, I will remind you next time you are at any supermarket"".  

There's a lot more he showed me but that was enough to leave me kind of slackjawed. Bear in mind, this was not some new high end Windows Phone. This was the existing off the shelf mid-range 1.4 ghz dual core Lumia 940XL he had. Been out for more than a year I think and it's just running Windows Phone 8.1. Not even the newest OS.  

So tell me guys, can I do this kind of thing with Siri? What am I missing? I feel like all Siri can do for me is help me dictated and send texts (slowly and badly at that), tell me the weather and serve up Bing search results without even reading them to me.  

What am I missing? Is Cortana really this much further ahead of Siri or do I just have a lot to learn?  If it's me, then can you guys point me in the right direction? Where can I go to learn to do more stuff like this with Siri?  

If it's *not* me and Siri really is behind the curve... well what do you guys think about that? Do you think Apple is really invested in making Siri better?  

I'd be lying if I said that demo didn't have me seriously thinking about getting a Windows Phone again. Not just for Cortana, I like other things about it, but I use Siri every day, so a virtual assistant that is more capable is definitely relevant to me....   I'd like reasons  to stick with the iPhone though, aside from the usual apps argument (I had all the apps I needed on WP really).  Anyone heard anything about Apple's plans for Siri? 


*TL;DR   Why does Cortana seem like it's 3 generations ahead of Siri?  Do I just need to learn to Siri better or am I SOL? Where do I go to learn to Siri better?*",420,439,2015-10-20,AAPL,0.04401790723204613,0.9198276996612549,0.036154329776763916

Trackpad 2 also works with Windows 10 but all you'll be able to do is move the cursor and left click. No other input or multitouch features or Force Touch are supported obviously but Windows did at least find the device over wired connection.

apple,IPod Touch stolen last year in Dhaka. Someone has emailed asking for my Apple ID and password so they can use it.,"Hello, I'm in need of some advice and/or help.

About mid last year on a work trip to Dhaka, Bangladesh my iPod touch was stolen from my pocket in the airport. I was too asleep from the flight to realise until I was on my way to the hotel.

I got very angry at myself for having my guard down and stuck it straight in lost mode 

It's never shown up on Find my iPhone which means its never connected to the internet. 

This morning I receieved this email: 



Dear Bro.

Good Morning

I found your i-pod, I stay in Dhaka, Bangladesh. If you are currently in Dhaka, 

then took the i-pod from me or kindly give me your Apple ID &amp; password so that I can use it.

 


Thanks

M******* *******



Sounds good right?

~~Thing is, he emailed my work address which isn't associated with the account.~~

I'm a bit of a freak about data security etc and I don't know how he could have found this email address unless he was actually past the numerical lockscreen. In which case I'm not happy. Can't remember what photos were on there/don't know what data he has access to. Either way, fuck that noise.

I did a quick search and this guy appears to be an IT guy at a company here in Dhaka. I've emailed back with a contact number and asking to pick it up but heard nothing back. 

My questions are, what do I do? 
How did he find my email?
If he's jailbroken it why does he need my apple ID? Is there any way to nuke the data on it?

I really hate being in the position of wondering what data this guy has access to. I would definitely like it back as it was stolen from me, failing that want to destroy all data and make it unusable.

Sorry about the essay.

tl;dr  ipod stolen last year, received email this morning about it, don't know how he could have got email address, would like it back or be able to nuke all data.



**EDIT: Got back to the hotel and I've had my work email as one of my recovery addresses so hopefully he's just seen that and not had access to any of my sweet dick pics. 
He's still not replied about pickup or anything so we will see in the morning. 
I'll update if anything excellent happens, thank you for all your suggestions. Consensus is that he hasn't bypassed the  lock screen yet**",237,811,2015-10-26,AAPL,0.08177771419286728,0.8914994597434998,0.026722854003310204

I just got the 6s+ 128gb, and I'm so happy with it I needed to make a post. 

The top things I find are the speed, size, battery. 
This thing actually lasts a FULL day for me now. The phone can actually keep up to the speed at which i use it. No lag. Anywhere. 
And the size of the screen makes me not even have to use my iPad when i get home.

After all, Overwatch does appear in the Blizzard launcher on Mac, I figured the Mac version would be coming out soon after.

Then on the most recent episode of the Overwatchers podcast, they flat out said that the game was not being developed for Mac and I couldn't believe it! I had to look for myself, and sure enough, this is what they say in the official beta FAQ:

Q. Will Mac users be able to participate in the beta?
We’re developing Overwatch for Windows-based PCs only, so a Mac-specific beta will not be provided.

What a let down!

Obviously, nobody turns to Mac as a platform specifically for playing games. But Blizzard has always been a staple when it comes to high quality games on Mac!

Honestly, I blame Apple! They've consistently been phasing out dedicated graphics cards from their offerings for years now! The only devices I can think of with dedicated graphics cards are Mac Pros, 27"" iMacs and MacBook Pros... and not even any MacBook Pro, only the top of the line. Not to mention that iMacs and MacBook Pros only have mobile graphics cards.
