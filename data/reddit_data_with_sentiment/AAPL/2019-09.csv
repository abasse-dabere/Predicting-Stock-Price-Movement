apple,I bought a Macbook with a destroyed Retina display for a very low price and used it to make the first ever iPad Pro/Macbook hybrid! [Video in description],"It‚Äôs done! Following up on a recent post that I made on this sub, my iPad/Macbook hybrid is complete. The method involved defusing the broken LCD screen and backlight from the upper portion of the MacBook‚Äôs clamshell, modifying the retina display driver, attaching a magnetic iPad case in-place of the retina display and putting everything back together. In regards to software, I‚Äôm using Catalina‚Äôs ‚ÄôSidecar‚Äô to wirelessly (bluetooth) mirror the once-existent Retina display and ‚Äòkeyboard maestro‚Äô to establish the initial connection to the iPad upon booting up.

Not in the video below is a demonstration of 1keyboard being used to re-route the Macbook‚Äôs keyboard as an input device for the iPad when Sidecar is disabled.

I think I‚Äôll make a video documenting the full process soon.

Any ideas for a name for the hybrid?

iphone,Battery Health: Stop battery capacity going down (the best [proven] way),"**TLDR: Don't use your iPhone when it's at 25% charge or less.**

**(Battery health is important since iPhone battery is by far one of the main components that cause the device to start running slow when it's capacity gets to \~80% cap or less. So, battery health is directly related to device's ""as-new"" feel and performance, hence related to longevity/obsolescence, and in the end (if you care); resale value)**

‚Äî

Thought I should share this:

So, I've read/viewed a lot of research **(main source credit goes to Battery University)**, and/so yeah, this is a scientific/quantified/statistical-based recommendation, considering the sources I've went through. So, I'm going to expand/complement on that with my personal experience, which came after following the advice I'm about to share, which resulted from my interpretation and simplification of a combination of sources.

We all know battery capacity goes down and never goes up again. We all want to know what are the best practices for battery health i.e keep its capacity as new (i.e 100% at iPhones Settings app - battery - battery health section). Losing battery cap over time inevitable, but the **average speed of that loss** ( \~1% every month in my observational experience) is ""usual"" only if you don't know the best practices for battery health.

Here comes the mix of my months of reading-concluding from many formal (and other not so much, but still relevant) sources, and then applying it to my iPhone \[don't worry, the main tip I give is based on the formal source\].

So..

**Got an iPhone X on November 2017. My battery capacity went down from 100% to %89 in 10 months** (more than 1pp per month, ah√°).. which I didn't like, so I started this research. At the same time, I took advantage of Apple's battery discount program (ended December 2018) and changed my battery for a new one, so the following findings where tested just after my clean new battery was installed i.e restarted at 100% capacity.

**Punch line:** **After changing my battery and applying the following rule, I have now more than 10 months with my new battery and it's still at 100% capacity.** \[Keeping every other usage habit constant\]

Yes!..., and, I can't think of any reason for it to start going down in the short term (I mean, it has to at some point, even if very slowly), but all I'm saying is, it will do so much more (drastically) slowly than before I knew all this.

‚Äî

**Conclusions/Best practices:**

1. **The ONLY ""rule"" is to avoid using your iPhone with less than 25% battery**

Logic: using/demanding the battery with ""low juice"" is the worst you can do to it, it's where it struggles the most and takes damage for life. It's like going to the gym with 1hr sleep. You can do it, but you might get some permanent damage if this is the standard practice.

‚Äî

**Considerations** \[this following lines describe MY exact usage during this 10 months applying said rule\]**:**

1. Charge WHENEVER and AS MANY times you WANT/NEED during the day; this doesn't have bad consequences
2. Freely use fast-charge chargers including wireless ones, up to 18W (iPad's brick); this doesn't have bad consequences
3. You can leave it connected at 100% and have **noticeable** bad consequences, battery is smart, and will be even smarter with iOS 13 i.e calculating when is it that you'll wake up, to stop at 80% during night and then get to 100% just in time for when you wake up.
4. Avoid extreme hot/cold temperatures; this one's kind of irrelevant, we're talking leaving it under de sun or putting it in a freezer. This one is related to consideration #2. As higher then 18W get too hot and 18W is the best cost/benefit on speed (also, iPhones don't even pull more than 18W, so is non-needed heat).

‚Äî

Now, **of course you'll use it with less than 25% battery occasionally or in emergencies**, but 99% of my days I manage to accomplish that rule, and after 10 months, battery is still 100% capacity (and yes, I've performed several battery calibrations during this months; to avoid wrong capacity readings).

Now of course Apple (or any manufacturer) can't teach this ‚Äúmagic‚Äù trick, .. it would sort of mean 1/4 of your battery is un-usable; which is not good for marketing, and is also not entirely true cause it is usable. Thing is, it has consequences (which are normal and the same in any smartphone, not just Apple's).

**Also, this 25% threshold behaves proportionally, meaning using you iPhone with 1-5% is WAY WORSE than using it with 20-25%. But yes; bad consequences generally start at 25%.**

The only way to re-gain your cap is buying a new battery. But at least with your actual one, this tip will practically make it ‚Äústop‚Äù losing any more cap. Mine is literally 100%, not 99% or 98%; its clean 100% after more than 10 months.

**Hope many people find this helpful! took me a while, and it's proved cause-effect tip/practice, so I feel confident. On my old battery I definitely used it A LOT on 1-5% remaining battery charge.**",318,443,2019-09-04,AAPL,0.0642687976360321,0.8766230046749115,0.0591081827878952

iphone,If you ever wondered what you've missed by sticking to iPhone and not trying Android flagships - you've missed nothing.,"This is kind of a short story.

I've been anti-Apple for as long as I remember. I thought they had overpriced, medicore hardware (both when it came to laptops and phones), packed in a nice-looking case. And so, I kept sticking to Dell/HP/Lenovo laptops and Android phones which were flagships. While Android phones I've been using were kind of fine, the laptops were just bad. I won't say what exactly I'm doing at work, but I use my laptop heavily, and unfortunately, I was stuck with Windows, as Linux was too unreliable.

And then, one day, I had to work with my colleague which was using a 2017 MacBook Pro. I barely had any previous experience with Apple hardware and macOS software, but I was mesmerized by how fluent his work was. We were doing pretty much the same thing, but his MacBook was fast, smooth and responsive, while my Windows laptop was laggy as hell. I think that I was already convinced by then, and a month later, I bought a MacBook Pro myself and it was one of the best decisions I ever made - I love it.

But I still kind of was resistant against using iPhone. My previous phone was already a bit slow (duh, thank you Android), but it happened that Samsung was about to release Galaxy S10, so I decided to wait and bought S10+. And guess what? It's just f\*\*\*ing bad.

First, the battery life. It's awful. I barely can get 3-4 hours of screen-on time, while it's set to 50% of brightness. Basically, after I unplug it, I wait around 30 minutes, and it's already down to 95-90%.

Second, the screen itself. The curved edges? I hate them. If not for my phone case, my fingers would constantly press those ""cool curved edges"", there's literally no way to hold the phone properly. The screen itself is fine, but I just can't help but think that iPhone screen is just brighter and better overall, but it may just be me.

Third, Android itself. The system itself is just ugly. Samsung's ""overlay"", OneUI or whatever they call it just made it uglier. Seriously. They only made like 10 system icons follow the same ""theme"", while the rest of the icons (especially of third-party apps, from the Google Play Store) is like a big white circle, with a minimized icon inside. I immediately had to download a custom launcher and a pack of icons because my eyes were bleeding.

And for the grande finale, let's talk about Samsung itself. They just announced that only S9 phones and S10 phones will be getting Android 10. Galaxy S8 won't receive any further updates and it was released in 2017. So what I'm looking at? A phone that receives few updates for the first 2 years and then is left out, because there are new flagships to support.

Oh, and Samsung tech support, boy, what a thrill. I had this problem, that sometimes, the screen would register random touches, like a ghost-press. I went with this issue to an authorized Samsung tech support in my local city and you know what? They said it's my fault because I pressed on the screen too hard (to remind you, Samsung doesn't have 3D Touch, no point in pressing the screen hard) and they made my warranty void.

I'm so done. When the iPhone 11 is released, I'm getting it. I just hope I'll be able to sell this piece of ""glorious"" hardware that S10+ is, at least for 50% of the initial price. I'm happier with my MacBook Pro than I ever was with any other laptop, so why not to try iPhone?

And by the way, any &amp; all tips for a new (future) iPhone user are welcome.

EDIT: Oh, I didn't describe another major thing. The camera. I was comparing the photo quality with my friend that has iPhone X, we were doing shots of different things, trying to use the same angles; long story short, imagine my disappointed that his iPhone was able to do just better photos than my brand-new Samsung flagship that was advertised for the amazing camera.",306,417,2019-09-08,AAPL,0.054904334247112274,0.9122509360313416,0.03284471109509468

apple,"My friends and I recreated every default Apple wallpaper (MacOS Mojave, High Sierra, Yosemite, etc.) during a one week road trip through California","A month ago me and two other friends went on a week road trip to visit each spot from Apple's ""California location"" themed wallpapers. Remember how Mac operating systems changed from big cats to nature photos? We visited all the locations of where the nature themed wallpapers were taken, and tried to recreate the iconic photos for ourselves (MacOS Mojave, High Sierra, Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, and Mavericks). 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/aceKqmG) is an image of 3 of the wallpapers, side by side with Apple's version.

If you want to see the rest of the photos or how the entire journey went, there is a link to a video we made [here](https://youtu.be/5yZuaAQKnkY). You can also check out the route we took, or download our wallpapers for yourself in the video's description. 

Our trip started in Death Valley, where we hiked sand dunes in 120+ degree heat to try and capture the [MacOS Mojave](https://512pixels.net/downloads/macos-wallpapers/10-14-Day.jpg) photo at sunset. Oh boy, was this rough! We ended up having to hike the sand dunes 3 times, since we couldn't find the right place to take the photo before the sun went down. I didn't know until months after the trip that we were in the hottest place on Earth! The only perk of going in the summer is all the sand dunes were beautifully untouched (you can see for yourself in the video).

Our next stop was Alabama Hills, a short drive from Death Valley. We arrived at 2AM, and got 3 hours of sleep before having to wake up before sunrise to take a photo of the mountain range in [MacOS Sierra](https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/macOS-Sierra-Wallpaper-Macbook-Wallpaper.jpg). We ended up getting really lucky finding the exact spot where the Apple wallpaper was taken. If you look, there is a rock formation in the foreground of the image that we just happened to see while we were racing against time to set up before the morning light was cast across the mountains. 

The same day we drove to the High Sierras for [this wallpaper](https://512pixels.net/downloads/macos-wallpapers/10-13.jpg). This was the easiest photo to get and is also my favorite of the trip. A quick Google search gave us the location, and all we had to do was hop out of the car and take the photo. I think our photo is beautiful in its own way, since it contrasts Apple's fall colors with lush greens. Also jumping in a cold lake was a great change from scorching hot sand dunes.

Next stop was in Yosemite National Park for [MacOS El Capitan](http://512pixels.net/downloads/macos-wallpapers/10-11.jpg). This photo was taken from Tunnel View, a popular spot for people to see the valley. We definitely came during the wrong season for this photo. If you take a look at our version, it's missing the clouds and snow in the background. Also, the light from the sun setting is much better in the winter.

Finding the photo of Half Dome for [MacOS Yosemite](http://512pixels.net/downloads/macos-wallpapers/10-10.jpg) was difficult. We read online that the photo could have possibly been taken in a field, but when we visited it we were nowhere close. It ended up taking us two days of hiking through unmarked trails to find the spot where the photo was taken!

In the end it was an incredible journey where we saw things we would never have seen had it not been for Apple. While our photos weren't a perfect match, that wasn't what the trip was about. The trip was about the chase -- kind of like a big scavenger hunt! It was about going outside and seeing these places for ourselves, instead of cooped up in an office looking at a screen. Because as amazing as Apple's wallpapers are, snapped at the right time under the perfect conditions, they still will never compare to seeing them in person.

iphone,iPhone XS Max purchased from Apple Store turned out to be a China Phone,"Yesterday at the Apple Store I purchased what I thought would be a brand new iPhone XS Max. The store was quite busy and the whole process took almost half an hour from speaking to someone to them having the phone in my hand. I was already running late thus decided not to open the box in a crowded store as I would rather unbox it in the peace and comfort of my own home.
 
I live about 15 minutes away and once I was home, I slid open the plastic seal, lift the box and immediately had a moment of shock. I've purchased many iPhones before so am quite familiar with Apple's packaging and what not. There was a phone in the box that resembled the size and shape of an actual XS Max and had a decent weight to it. However, I immediately noticed something was wrong:

-	No screen protector on the device
-	A couple finger prints on the screen
-	Scuff mark on the top left of the screen

I picked up the device and when I turned it on, there was a loud beep and it dropped me right off on the home screen - no regular startup and setup process at all. I realized right away this is a bigger issue than just a phone that hasn't been packaged properly and could tell by the resolution and software that this isn't even an Apple device. Now it looked pretty legit but anyone who's even minimally used an iPhone before would be able to realize within minutes based on the software alone.
 
It was 8:40PM at this point but I wasn't about to leave this until tomorrow. I rushed back to the store in a panic and found the sales person that cashed me out. I quickly explained to him what happened to which he connected with a manager - he seemed very concerned but the manager had quite a bit of an attitude when the situation was being explained to her and advised that they won't be able to do anything about it right now. She stated that they have to investigate and check their cameras, etc. At this point they already scanned the serial number and could identify that this device has had a total of 3 transactions including mine. It was obvious to me that someone purchased this before, replaced the device with the fake and returned it - to which Apple then resold to me.
 
At the end, they took the information down and went in the back to ""investigate"" and about 15 minutes later came out to me with a new device. They stated the manager found out this has happened to a couple other stores nearby as well.
 
It was truly an hour of panic as I thought I was down ~$1,600.
 
If you're the specialist that cashed me out and are reading this, thank you for your help with everything! You were a great support.
 
TLDR: I purchased a brand new iPhone XS Max from the Apple Store - when opened at home it turned out to contain a fake ""China iPhone"" inside. Was able to take it back to the store and have Apple replace it.

Edit: this happened in Toronto, Canada.

Edit 2: received a bigger response than I thought! To answer some questions: 

1.	the price for the current iPhone's drop as soon as the new line of iPhones are announced, hence why I bought the XS Max.

2.	the phone I received was shrink wrapped from the Apple store. however, this shrink wrap which is on any iPhone you'd buy right now on the Apple store is more of a wrap that you peel off and if unwrapped carefully, you'd be able to place it back together. Though Apple didn't directly share the results of the investigation with me, it's obvious that the phone was purchased by someone before (the serial number of the device had 3 separate receipt transactions) and then returned. When they must have taken it back, they could've either returned it to someone they know that works there who'd process the return quickly for them and be in on the scam, or the scammer knew that they wouldn't open up what appears to be a sealed phone. The Apple specialist mentioned that before they used to open up any device that came in whether it was sealed or not but they stopped doing that recently.",224,1977,2019-09-12,AAPL,0.11534067243337631,0.8539273142814636,0.03073200024664402

apple,Apple News launched 4 years ago and still only supports 4 countries,"From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_News):  


&gt;The app was announced at Apple's WWDC 2015 developer conference. It was released alongside the iOS 9 release on September 16, 2015, for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. At launch, the app was only available to users in the United States, but within a month had become available to users in Australia and the United Kingdom.

Canada was added in 2019 I believe. 

Is News just something Apple isn't interested in that much? I can't be critical of Apple's 'Services' in general because [most of them are in many more countries](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/), but News seems just ignored. And I know people will say it's difficult to 'make deals' with regional news organizations and that's the reason, but especially for the non-paid version of Apple News, I find it hard to believe these deals are so challenging that after 4 years, Apple has only managed to negotiate with news providers in 4 countries. It's not as if regional licensing and related issues do not exist for music, movies, etc., and Apple seems capable for providing content for their international users for these mediums.  

Maybe there just isn't much demand for it, but it's something I've wanted to try (in a functional local way, not with the workarounds that let you view US news outside of the US or whatever.) It's just surprising that it's STILL in only 4 countries. Not in continental Europe or Japan or anywhere else.",154,592,2019-09-15,AAPL,0.020310545340180397,0.9211359024047852,0.05855351313948631

Details inside, and good luck!","24 hours is up and the winner is announced! https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/d7vsh0/and_the_winner_of_the_iphone_11_pro_is/

Hey!

I build a Reddit client for iOS called [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575). In a sentence, it's an iOS-focused Reddit app (not crossplatform, iOS only) that's an alternative to the official app with the goal of being speedy, comfortable to use, great media browsing, and just the best iOS has to offer in general. I loved Alien Blue, and wanted to build something as powerful and awesome as it, but with the goal of feeling even more like an iOS-first experience. [Here's a link](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575)

I started working on Apollo right after I finished working at Apple in the summer of 2015, worked on it through 2017 when it finally got released, and it's been my full time job since.

I love that I can build such a fun and exciting app every day, and no bullshit, it's only because of the support of the Reddit Apple community that I've been able to. There's no ads, no investors, only optional support from you guys to sustain the app. It's built solely with the goal of making Redditors happy and I do my absolute best to be active in the community and base the app around its feedback.

So as a thank you, and to celebrate many sleepless nights working on the iOS 13 update that's now live, I wanted to do a lil giveaway open to anyone in the community. I'm not Unbox Therapy so it's not a pick up truck full of iPhones, but I thought giving away an iPhone 11 Pro (or Pro Max) could be a fun way to say thanks (or a regular iPhone 11 if that's what you want).

### How do I enter?

Just comment and you're entered. If you want something to comment about, uhh, help me name [the Apollo mascot](https://apolloapp.io). You have [24 hours](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=how+long+until+4+pm+september+22+2019+halifax%2C+nova+scotia+time).

### What do I win?

An iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max or regular 11 (maybe you want that nice red). 256GB. Color of your choice.

### Any rules?

Your Reddit account has to have been created before this thread was posted to prevent a bunch of duplicate accounts posting. Also I'll PM you if you win, you have 48 hours to respond to the PM (will go out Monday) or it'll go to the next person. All countries accepted so long as it's not impossible to get it to you.

### What's in Apollo's iOS 13 update?

Like I said Apollo's really focused on being the best iOS has to offer and really feeling at home on the platform. iOS 13 brought a bunch of really cool stuff, so I wanted to support as much of it as I could on day 1. So Apollo has support the (finally) system dark mode, the new haptic touch context menus, super fast launch times, there's Siri Shortcuts support so you can say [""normie garbage"" and have it open r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/90b66h/yo_is_apollo_gonna_support_siri_shortcuts/) or just build cool systems in the Shortcuts app in general. There's also multi-window support on iPad which is super cool. Hell, iOS 13 even supports PS4 and Xbox One controllers now so I added support for those. I really wanted to build something that didn't feel like a cross-platform, half Android /Material Design mixture, but instead feels like it was built from the ground up for iOS.

### Should I give Apollo a try? I don't mind the official app tbh

The official app's really cool, built by some super smart people, I even got to meet some of the engineers at WWDC this year. Utmost respect. It's kinda like a car though, you might use your car, it might get you from point A to point B fine, it's a solid enough car, why switch? Well, you might sit in a friend's car, find it just a bit more comfortable, maybe a bit speedier, sportier, appreciate some of the design choices better, and overall just find it a more enjoyable experience. Apollo Car has a really awesome media viewer, fast swipe gestures, speed, GIF scrubbing, a subreddit Jump Bar, really great comments view, and much more that you really have to see first hand. On top of this, in this analogy the competing car is free, [so why not try it](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575). :P 

Oh here's a quick album of screenshots I put together: https://imgur.com/a/UO2J10s (There's light mode too if you're into that!)

### I have an idea for your app!

Sick, that would make for a great comment, please do. :D I genuinely build the app solely planned around community feedback, so I'd greatly appreciate it!

AppleWatch,"The new Solar Dial face, explained","WatchOS 6 adds a beautiful new watch face called Solar Dial. It has 4 ‚Äúnew style‚Äù complications around an elaborate sundial/orrery-style display of current sun position. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people on this subreddit mention they were unsure of what the sundial shows exactly. Since I‚Äôm a bit of an astronomy dork, so I thought I‚Äôd put together a guide of just what it‚Äôs showing.

Notes about the screenshots:

* I am in Portland, Oregon, which lies at approximately 44.5N, 122.5W. Local time is Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7)

* The complications are (clockwise from top left): Activity, weather temp, calendar, and date. All 4 are native in watchOS 6
* I‚Äôm using the digital version of the face. The analog one is the same, except for having an analog clock inside the sundial.
* The event at 9pm is the [GSL Code S semifinals](https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/551355-code-s-ro4-preview-maru-vs-trap), where Maru and Trap will play to advance to the final match of one of the most difficult video game tournaments in the world.

With that, onto the explanation of the sundial!

https://i.imgur.com/trol1Vf.png

The outer dial shows the 24 hours of the current day. This is in your local time, so 12 on the dial is noon local time, 18 is 6:00pm local time, etc. The needle points to both the current time and position of the sun along the inner ring

The inner ring - the sun track - has dots marking a number of positions. [Solar noon](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/solar-noon.html) is near the top, today in Portland it was at 1:04pm. Solar noon marks the point in the day with the highest solar elevation. You can use the crown to adjust the sundial and check the time of solar noon, sunset, etc. Due to our modern time zone system, this does not occur precisely at 12:00pm local time, and daylight savings time exacerbates this in many locations, including the one I live in.

https://i.imgur.com/ZJj5VDF.png

The lighter part of the sundial marks the daylight hours, and this section is asymmetrical as a result of solar noon not being at 12:00pm. The darker part, of course, is night. Another dot on the sun ring marks solar midnight, the point of lowest solar elevation. That was 1:04am this morning.

https://i.imgur.com/HWe7ZSs.png

As you can see from this screenshot, the sundial color shifts throughout the day as the color of the sky changes. It also subtly shifts from greenish-blue in the morning to purplish-blue in the afternoon.

The additional wedges and dots around sunset and sunrise mark off the different stages of twilight. There are 3 phases: Civil twilight, which starts when the sun is at -6¬∞ below the horizon and runs until sunrise in the morning, and from sunset to when the sun at -6¬∞ in the evening. Nautical twilight is when the sun is between -6¬∞ and -12¬∞. Lastly, astronomical twilight is when the sun is between -12¬∞ and -18¬∞. You can read more about twilight standards here: https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html 

That page has a graphic that looks quite similar to the wedge markings on the solar dial face:
https://c.tadst.com/gfx/750x500/twiligh-phases.png

The 4 dots on the sun ring at twilight mark (for morning, substitute sunset/dusk for evening) astronomical dawn, nautical dawn, civil dawn, and sunrise

Right now it‚Äôs close to the equinox, so the day and night sections are about the same size. In the summer, the night section is a smaller part of the dial, in the winter, the day section becomes smaller. At high latitudes, there is no night in the summer: just a single long twilight that goes from sunset to sunrise. At very high latitudes (above the arctic and antarctic circles at ~66.5) there is not even a sunset/sunrise or twilight in summer, just 24hrs of day. The inverse is of course true in the winter. The solar dial face will use your location to show the correct day and night sizes for where you are and what time of year it is.

Finally, the clock dial just shows the current local time. It is attached to the sundial needle, and will always be on the dial opposite of the sun. The clock face is translucent, showing a blurred view of the sundial behind it. The segments around the digital clock face represent seconds. The colors of the complications also subtly shift throughout the day, although unlike the older solar graph face, they don‚Äôt turn orange at sunset and sunrise (perhaps because so much of the dial is still blue?)

Finally, enjoy this album showing how the color shifts throughout the day: https://imgur.com/a/Z4eh6fl",115,1262,2019-09-21,AAPL,0.04880615323781967,0.9224634766578674,0.028730332851409912

iphone,Had my first tumble with the 11 Pro,"So I just had my first tumble with my 11 Pro and I figured I‚Äôd share just so people can have some real world understanding of how sturdy the phone is. 

I took my phone out of its case cause there was a cat hair on the back glass and I could see it cause I have a clear otterbox. Once I have it out. Give it a good wipe down with the little cloth that comes with a screen protector. And the little fucker slips right out of my hand like a bar of soap. 

I was in my tile bathroom. The drop was maybe 3 or 4 feet but like I said it shot forward and then fell down. It looked and sounded like it hit the corner of the phone and then landed face down (which always fucking terrifies me, glad I also had a glass screen protector) but anyways I pick it up to examine, not a scratch or ding anywhere on the thing. Before it landed face down it tumbled a couple times so the back glass and camera housing glass definitely hit the tile. 

Anyways im super surprised and impressed. Apple built a mighty strong phone here. I‚Äôve made similar mistakes before with an iPhone 5s and a 7 and the results weren‚Äôt as good trust me lmao (broken screen protector on one, broken screen on the other because I was between screen protectors). 

Tl;dr dropped my iPhone 11 pro on hard tile and it came out unscathed. Great job Apple.
