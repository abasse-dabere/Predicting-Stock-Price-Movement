apple,"I have a crazy good idea for an app, but I have 0 coding/developer experience.","Essentially, it's a silent disco application. You'd have all the iPod Touch/iPhone's on the same wifi network, all playing music from a central playlist that one person, the party leader, generates and puts up. When the party leader presses play, the music starts on all the other iPod's at the same time.
As for the concept of a silent disco/dance party, it is essentially a whole bunch of people listening to their own iPods, but the same song at the same time. It cuts down the possibility of noise violations for parties but it's still capable of being totally awesome. I just got back from a silent disco, and I have to say it is one of the better experiences I've had dancing and jamming.

Now my request is that someone take this idea and run with it (some credit to me would be nice, but not a big deal), and that the profits go to reddit. Who'd be game?

Edit: Wow, apparently having an idea is reason enough to get extensively lambasted by dozens of people. Thanks for the help, I wasn't trying to offend anyone. Jesus.

Edit: I understand that I'm out of my element, but I don't think that this is reason for frustration. I don't know how hard coding is, but the plethora of alternatives has come up and I'm very happy with that. I mean no offense to anyone and I really dislike the reaction that I've been getting from a lot of other people. sarcasticzombie took the right approach, even if there are people who oppose him. His commentary was kind, even if people don't necessarily think it's right.

apple,"Reddit, you wouldn't believe what happened to me at the Apple Store.","Some background info: I purchased my MacBook Pro in January 2009. At some point in mid-2009, I mistakenly spilled Red Bull all over my keyboard like a moron. The delete key, along with a few other keys towards the top right were mainly affected. Somehow, I dealt with this until recently because my delete key snapped in half. I'm not a very accurate typist so I heavily rely on my delete key. Anyways, my warranty has expired and I didn't purchase Apple Care. (Although, I'm pretty sure water damage isn't covered)

So, I brought it in to the Apple Store hoping the technician would replace a few keys for free. I certainly didn't expect Apple to do anything, because they're not obligated to do so. I definitely wouldn't have been disappointed if they decided to turn me away. So, while I was hoping for the best, I wasn't too optimistic. (I'm aware I could have fixed it myself via ifixit, or found someone on CL).

Anyways, the technician was extremely courteous and helpful. He went into the back and came back with a new delete key. However, they weren't the right type since my MacBook is the original unibody. He goes into the back again to look for another key and comes back empty handed. I thank him for all his help and start to pack up my laptop. He tells me I can replace the entire keyboard for $800. I tell him I can't afford it so he tells me Apple is willing to cover the $800 repair for free.

Free? Yes, free. I thought Ashton Kutcher was going to pop out and 'punk' me or something because I had no idea these sort of anecdotal stories I've always read about Apple were actually true. I have never considered myself a ""fanboy"" because I only purchase products I heavily research and actually like. But, this sort of customer service has solidified the reason why I don't mind spending a tad bit more for Apple products. Their customer service is top notch. 


tl;dr Apple replaced my water damaged, out of warranty, MacBook keyboard for free. 


EDIT: I've noticed a lot of comments regarding the $800 quote. Maybe he was exaggerating, maybe he wasn't. Remember, this is the unibody MacBook Pro, so I don't think they are replacing JUST the keyboard. Because a keyboard does not cost anything remotely close to $800. But, the point of posting this was Apple covering an out-of-warranty, water damaged computer.",173,107,2010-08-03,AAPL,0.07912395894527435,0.88837069272995,0.032505352050065994

iphone,Alien Blue HD - An early preview of the iPad client for Reddit [VID],"TL/DR: [Video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsdaT2w2T40) (high-def recommended)

Hi all,

Very excited to share this with everyone.  I've been working almost every spare second in bringing together the core features for the iPad.  I know that most of you were okay with a simple port from the iPhone, but I wanted this to be something more.

There is an overwhelming amount of ideas and improvements that will be rolled out after the initial release, but I need to make sure that the fundamental features (like commenting) are solid first.

At present, the alpha build (one used in creating this demo) is riddled with bugs, and I need to iron out a few critical defects before sending the beta through for testing.

My aim for Alien Blue HD is to create the fastest and most intuitive way to interact with Reddit on a touchscreen.  As the application nears completion for the initial release, the different parts of the app are coming together nicely.

Thank you all for your encouragement and support.  Some of you even offered to buy me an iPad, which I thought was very sweet.  Now it's time for me to stomp some of these critical bugs, and prep the beta!

**Edit: ** I know this is off topic, but I will be pushing another early update through this weekend to fix the **Can't connect to Reddit** dialogs that are plaguing some of your iPhones on 3G networks.

Hopefully Apple will have it available on your iPhone by the following week.  In the meantime, please accept my sincerest apologies for the annoyance, had I spotted this during beta testing, I could have saved you the trouble.",62,76,2010-08-05,AAPL,0.017781458795070648,0.9112917184829712,0.07092681527137756

mac,"I have a few questions about my MBP that I am hoping some of you can answer for me, please.","1) About 3 months ago my HDD died in the middle of a very busy week so I got a new one and replaced it myself and have been using it since. I just found out that I am still covered under Apple Care. HDDs are considered user replaceable in for some notebooks prior to my model (2007) as well as in the current models but I can't find such info mentioned in my the manual for my computer.  Has replacing the HDD voided my warranty or not? 

2) If I want to get the faulty Apple HDD replaced would I need to reinstall it into my computer or could I just bring it in and explain that I removed it because it stopped working?

3) My battery charge indicator periodically tells me that the battery is faulty and needs to be replaced, other times it just acts like it should. Additionally Coconut Battery says my battery is fine every time I run the app. What could cause these periodic warnings that occur every couple weeks? Should I get Apple to replace the battery again? This is the second replacement battery that they have given me so far for this machine.

4) People who have used my computer recently say that it runs really hot and insisted that I schedule a genius bar appointment to get it checked out because they are scared that it will burn down the house. I know it doesn't run hot enough to do that easily and am not all too scared about it but I did get a temp monitor application to check on things.  When idling (nothing but the OS running) my temp specs look like [this](http://imgur.com/JcNJ6) and when actively doing almost anything (youtube, itunes music, etc)  it will change to [this](http://imgur.com/aQZ8t). Is this a normal temperature range? Google suggests to me that this is abnormal, albeit slightly, and that the idle range should be about 10ºC lower on the CPUs. 

My computer is a 2007 MBP 2.4GHz 15in model.

apple,"Programming for Mac OS X and iPhone where do I 
start?","Hey Apple Reddit

I'm finally looking at furthering what I can do with my computer and phone beyond what someone has done for me. I've put it off far too long and really want to get started.

I've used macs my entire life and have a very strong knowledge of how computers work and the troubleshooting of macs in particular. I have a good knowledge of iOS devices and have fooled a bit with jailbreaking. I am not afraid of Terminal and can follow guides with ease, sometimes getting creative and try to modify the instructions. I've played with Automator and Applescript a few years ago and some scripting as a kid in classic.

But, I've never taken any sort of class, picked up any sort of book...nothing. I have a good basis but I am not sure where to go from here. I would like to be able to write for both platforms in the end but I think iOS stuff may drive me a bit better in the begining.

Should I start by reading a C or Obj -C text? Would that be just jumping in right over my head? Start with Java and write a web app firtst? 

I have a Mac Mini that will probably be my main machine with an 06 macbook and 16gb 3gs as a test bed. I will be purchasing an iPad soon.

Thanks for any advice and help.

Well, https://phonerecover.com/ was available and I'm not terribly creative with names.

I have future plans in mind (mainly around reporting and groups) that I hope will take it beyond simply a Find My iPhone substitute. For now, I figure there is probably a small market of people that would be interested in Find My iPhone functionality without the $99/year price. You can check out the web interface by visiting: https://phonerecover.com/account/demo

Since Apple gives me a number of promo codes per revision, it only makes sense for me to give as many away so that I have no promo codes left by the time my next revision is approved. 

It is a subscription based app (I've got servers to run), but if you leave a review in the AppStore and PM me I'll give your subscription a bump for a year. Feedback is always appreciated.

iphone,Android defector has a few questions,"I used an 2G iPhone way back in the day, and somewhere along the line made the switch to Android.

At first, I was in love with the freedom and the all the cool things I could do. But I soon realized that, while the freedom was nearly infinite and it was an extremely powerful system, it was very lacking in the user experience department. More lacking than I was willing to put up with.

So, I got an iPhone 4 today. I've not used the phone much, but I've used it enough to have a few concerns and to want to know more.

First off, what are some good iPhone forums to go to for technical help, tips and tricks, cool apps, etc? I liked Android Central and XDA Developers when I was using Android. Not really planning to jailbreak the phone just yet but I'm not averse to it eventually.

My first concern is that when I stream video online there's no video. I've tried it so far with Vimeo and a couple of porn sites that worked fine on my Android device. When I try to play them on my iPhone there's only audio.

Secondly, is there a (non-jailbreak) way to modify the text message alert system? Ideally something that adds an input field to the pop-up alert, allowing replies.

Thirdly, is it possible to set a minimum threshold for auto-brightness? I'm in a very dark room right now and the phone's screen is dark enough to bother my eyes. (It's a good brightness level in better-lit areas). 

How can I get an official pink bumper case for retail price or through the case program? The case program app only shows the black bumper as available, and I can't find the pink bumper anywhere for below $50.

What's the best solution for dashboard mounting + FM transmitter audio listening in the car? Preferably not DIY as I'm not mechanically inclined.

What is the maximum resolution video it will play? The Apple store says it will play H.264 files up to 720p, but I tried adding a 720p video (H.264 video, AC3 audio, .mp4 container) and iTunes told me the device wouldn't play it. I also couldn't even add .m2ts or .mpg files to iTunes even if they used H.264 video and AAC audio.

Can I sync my Facebook contacts with the phone the way I could on Android? I saw the option in the Facebook app but it didn't add any contacts to my address book or even modify an existing contact with FB info.

Last question. Is the download speed artificially limited, or is my network just shitty? Just ran the speed test app while on WiFi and only got 9.7mbps down when my laptop, also on WiFi, gets 16.69mbps down. Upload is the same-ish.

Anyway, thanks in advance for any replies, and I look forward to being a member of the /r/iPhone community.

iphone,Has anyone ever left At&amp;t for anything they feel is better than an iphone?,"I have had an iphone since the second release of the first generation.  Prior to having an iphone I use to be really up on the current phones and the release of any new mobile device.  I left sprint and my Motorola Q (which was the best phone out there other than the blackberry at that time) behind without a second thought.  Since my first iphone I have replaced it twice with the 3g and the 3gs models.  I have been more then satisfied with the iphone and its capabilities.  I also plan on upgrading to a newer version of the iphone, weather it be the 4 or something further out.  I can’t really say more then the iphone works for me and I like it.  The only thing I have been rather unhappy with is the cost and quality of the At&amp;t phone plan, but that’s issues in themselves.  Anyhow since I have been running the iphone my interests in other phones have fizzled out completely.  Other than the DroidX I can’t name other phone on the market right now, possibly for the fact that I can’t see beyond the iphone and apple.  Lately at work I have heard a lot of people smack talking the 4 and the iphone in general.  Pretty much everyone I encounter with the attitude of the iphone being a piece of shit I ask “have you ever owned and iphone”?  I am yet to find someone who says “yeah I have had one and it just didn’t work out, I have moved on to (insert other phone) and like it so much more”.  Obviously, I am aware that people have left At&amp;t and the iphone for various reasons, but they seem to be few and far between.

apple,I just had an extremely difficult to diagnose issue with the Magic Touchpad - here's how I fixed it,"It would pair just fine via Bluetooth, but it only worked as a normal mouse (no multitouch, no battery monitoring).  When I'd go to set it up in the Touchpad control panel, it just wouldn't see it.  Or it would say ""pairing attempt was unsuccessful"" even though it clearly was.

I tried a number of solutions, and eventually ended up up the phone with an extremely helpful Apple support rep (hi Shane!), who suggested that I reinstall the OSX 10.6 upgrade, then reinstall the 10.6.4 update.  After doing all of that it occurred to me that the third party driver I installed to make my Logitech mouse work (Logitech makes godawful Mac drivers) may be causing the problem.

Uninstalled USB Overdrive (which sucks anyway), now my Magic Touchpad works perfectly.

I found NO information on this via Google, and even Apple's 2nd tier tech support was stumped.  So maybe I can save someone else the trouble if they find this.  I have to say though, even though they didn't solve the issue, Apple support was very friendly and helpful throughout the whole process.

ipad,"Seriously considering getting an iPad, thoughts?","I'm a 4th year Computer Science student who's looking towards grad school. I own a macbook, and have previously owned a netbook. I'm seriously considering an iPad as an eReader, mostly for pre-formatted PDFs from various research archives, but also for comic and other ebooks. I'm very interested in the app Papers, which acts as a reference manager and library app, allowing citation and annotation.  The browsing might be nice, and the video stuff, but I likely won't carry too much music. The only other thing I would use it for is as a way to show of my amateur phtos. 

I'm not looking at the iPad as a netbook replacement, but I think in some scenarios it could act that way. Browsing in a coffee shop, or whatever. 

Thoughts? Are there things I haven't considered here? Things I ought to be aware of?",45,15,2010-08-31,AAPL,0.02553505264222622,0.943908154964447,0.030556779354810715
