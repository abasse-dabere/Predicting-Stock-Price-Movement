AppleWatch,Big shout to Apple Watch for saving my butt,"Big shoutout to Apple Watch

It’s Friday evening. I’m the last person in the office. Trying to leave, but have to pee, so I run out to the restroom. I came back and the door was locked... office admin had locked it before she left. I didn’t have my phone or keys on me and our building doesn’t have a front desk in the lobby. I’m livid as custodians don’t arrive until 6pm and it’s 4pm. Luckily I had my watch and I was able to find and call the number to the office property managers. Someone came and opened up my office. I know my other option would be to go flag someone down or go to another office suite, but glad I was able to get it done with my watch. 

Even though I was converted into an Apple fanboy during college (had iPod Touch, Macbook, iPad, and iPhone), I used to think the watch was stupid and I’d never get one. Glad I hopped on the bandwagon.",41,483,2018-12-01,AAPL,0.03264260292053223,0.9247738718986511,0.04258355498313904

apple,Downgraded to iPhone X from iPhone XS. The cell reception was definitely worse.,"I've been a stalwart Apple user since 2006 when I made the switch from Windows – owned the original iPhone, iPad, unibody MBP, iMac, Mac Mini, Apple Watch, you name it. I've also been on the iPhone Upgrade Program since its inception as it made it easier for me to upgrade to the new iPhone every year, saving me from the trouble of selling my device on Craigslist and all that jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

I ""upgraded"" to the XS when it launched, and I noticed the cell reception was much worse. Specifically, I live in NYC and ride the subway a lot, commuting around the city all day to meet my clients. NYC, despite being a world class city, does not have world class cell reception on the subway in-between stations. I often type up an email or text message between stops when I have no cell reception, and upon arriving at the next stop, I toggle/untoggle airplane mode to reconnect my phone's cellular reception and then quickly send out an email or text message. On the iPhone X, I never had a problem reconnecting in a few seconds, just like on any other iPhone in years past. On the iPhone XS, the phone would often be unable to connect within the window of opportunity that the train was in the station. The train would depart, and I'd still have a ""Searching"" or ""No connection"" status. Ultimately, I'd be unable to send out that email or text, affecting my productivity.

&amp;#x200B;

After doing more research, I learned that the iPhone X is using a Qualcomm modem whereas the iPhone XS is using an Intel modem. Apple is in a legal dispute with Qualcomm, whom I feel is being greedy in the matter, and this caused Apple to go with Intel modems in their latest iPhone line. I get all that. Sadly, for my use case (yes, I have read the reports of faster download speeds), Apple shipped an inferior product. Since it is a hardware issue, I had no faith that a software update could fix it, and it just seemed wrong to pay money for such an expensive product that made my life worse. Ultimately, I decided to return my iPhone XS and purchase the iPhone X.

&amp;#x200B;

This was really upsetting for a couple reasons. First, I had already paid a year's worth of iPhone Upgrade Program payments for my previous iPhone X, and now, I have nothing to show for those payments, which is a lot of money. Second, the time and energy wasted troubleshooting this issue, reading up about modems, doing the financial math, calling customer support, etc. was hours of my life I'd have back if Apple didn't ship an inferior phone. Third, which is related to the previous point, this has broken my faith in Apple. I've been following the MBP keyboard issues as well, but that didn't affect me, because I'm still using a 2015 rMBP. But now that I've been personally affected by Apple's ever degrading quality standards, whenever I'm next in the market to buy or upgrade a tech product, I'm going to critique Apple with a skeptical eye and have to think seriously about whether the product is actually good or bad. For me, part of Apple's appeal when Steve Jobs was around was the simplicity of its product line and how you could have faith in Apple to ship a great product without knowing all the technical aspects of its hardware. That was such a beautiful thing that is underappreciated about the Apple of old. Steve wanted to make purchasing Apple products easy. You didn't have to understand the difference between Intel vs. Qualcomm modems or really understand what was happening underneath the hood. You only had to understand that it would be faster, easier to use, etc., and you could trust that Apple would deliver. That Apple is no more sadly.

&amp;#x200B;

My recommendation to anyone who has the iPhone X is to be very careful when you consider upgrading to the iPhone XS or any future iPhone iterations that use Intel modems.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My iPhone XS had reception issues, which, after troubleshooting and research, I found out were related to Apple's switch to Intel modems from Qualcomm modems. Since it's a hardware issue, which may not be fixable through software updates, I decided to downgrade to iPhone X. This cost me time, energy, and money to do. Unlike during the Steve Jobs era, in the future, I will have to thoroughly vet Apple's newest products before buying them as I've lost faith in Apple.

AppleWatch,Heading to a cardiologist.....,"Ok holy hell.... strap in.

If you have the Apple Watch 4 please please update to the new firmware released yesterday and take your ECG.

I did last night and tried it out.  Weird.  Abnormal heat rate notifications.  Ran the ECG app and came back afib.  Well...glitchy firmware. Let’s try again. Afib.  Again and again and again.  Piece of crap watch.

My wife wakes up and I put it on her.  Normal. Normal.  Me afib.  Try the other wrist, try the underside of the wrist.  Every time afib warning.

Ok.  So go to Patient First.  Parking lot full and I’m going to blow it off and head home.   Look at the watch again, afib again.

Fine walk in and sign in. They ask what’s wrong and I’m embarrassed.   ‘Ok so there is a new watch feature....hahaha....I’m silly but can we check this?”

I did not know that this comment was a quick queue pass for Patient First.   I’m taken right back and hooked up.  The technician looks at the screen and says “I’m going to get the doctor”

Doctor comes in, looks at the screen, looks at me and says “You should buy Apple stock.  This probably saved you.  I read about this last night and thought we would see an upswing this week. I didn’t expect it first thing this morning.”

Soooo long story short, heading to a cardiologist right now.

Test yourself. I didn’t have a clue.  I may not ever have.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT - Folks asked, so below are 2 of the exports from Health and a section of the ECG that was run at the doctor for comparison.

Update - A quick update as folks have asked. We ran over to see the cardiologist who fit me in. He did a short exam, reviewed the earlier ECG, confirmed the afib diagnosis, and did a ultrasound of my heart. I’m scheduled to go back in a week for some additional tests to start looking at the cause… blood, thyroid, etc… He also scheduled me with a partner who specializes more in the electrical side of things to have it looked from that angle as well.

As for today? They sent me home with a Dilitiazem prescription. This morning the heart-rate is finally down from the 120-140 range and in the 75-90 range and pressure still elevated around 125/80. Far better than yesterday but not sure if that is the medicine or just a day’s perspective but we’ll see.

Thank you so much for all the kind words and shared experiences! For now off to breakfast, Tae Kwon Do with the family, and then some holiday shopping.


UPDATE 2 - A national morning show filmed a segment at our house tonight.  If they use any of the B-real footage all I can say is:

1 - It’s been a long stressful weekend.  Telling your wife she has 2 hours before a film crew is showing up at the house is NOT conducive to LOW stress.

2 - Showing us playing a game as a family seemed like a great idea at the time.

3 - My daughter picked Ticket To Ride Junior.

4 - We do know how to play the game.  It’s been a stress weekend (also see #1). You will see dumb moves if they show anything don’t judge us.


UPDATE 3 - Echocardiagram results came back tonight: “Your EF (ejection fraction) is around 50%. ” Which is a little low apparently, or just at the bottom of normal.  Also my “atrial size was mild to moderately increased in size”.  Waiting to find out what that means in the real world.

Final update -  Cardioverted this morning and all is perfect again.  Checking out sleep clinics for the potential that apnea caused this. 

For all that negative that gets said about Reddit, folks here were far kinder and more supportive than I’d ever would have imagined!  Thank you so much for all of the kind words, support, and information!

AppleWatch,My Apple Watch probably saved my life,"Mobile blah blah, formatting blah blah.

I work 4-10PM, and my work is really close to my house (1.1 miles) so I see no need to drive. I was on my way home last Saturday and had a seriously unsettling feeling about a car that had been sticking with me this whole way. I take a rather “round about way” home. So a car following wouldn’t be normal/acceptable. I had my AirPods in and a hood on so they weren’t visible. I was able to trigger SOS under my sleeve and talk to dispatch through my AirPods. They sent 2 officer/cruisers out. One to address me, and the other to address the car. 

Turns out the guy following me had a record of this, found photos on a camera in his car of me, (from other nights too) and made an arrest. I feel that if I would’ve taken out my phone that I would’ve given myself away and he’d have made a move. 

I’m so thankful for this gadget because I literally was able to call for police and made it look like I was checking the time. I honestly thought this was a gimmick at first but now it’s ALWAYS on me or within my sight. 

Can’t provide much more detail because of ongoing investigation. Alt account for obvious reasons.

Like we all know, Apple is [bending the OLED panel](https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/03/iphone-x-flexible-oled-display.jpg) of the X, XS and XS Max phones to get the chin-less look, something Android phones are not able to achive till now. It also helps that Apple makes [pretty even bezels](https://www.gsmarena.com/measuring_the_bezels_of_the_iphone_x-news-28132.php) around the display to get a nice uniform look. When the rumors of a cheaper but also *full screen* LCD iPhone started to surface, I was wondering how Apple will achieve it, because no one was bending LCDs, and many Android phones had this 3 slim bezels look with a big chin on the bottom. Then the XR came out and it became obvious that Apple couldn't quite reach the X-levels of bezel width, and as a result XR's are much chunkier giving that *iPhone X in a case* look. But the idea and reception was - Apple did everything possible to make bezels as thin as possible with the (Japan Display provided) tech available today, regarding the use of LCDs and pushing the screen to the edges. What was my surprise when I stumbled on the news and info regarding a cheap chinese Honor phone, which as it turns out has smaller chin than the iPhone. How did they do that?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen so many guys here claiming that the Xr's screen is a first for an LCD without a chin, that Japan Display came up with some new technology, and as it turns out some budget android phone can have an lcd panel with a notch with curved edges all while having much smaller bezels all around.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: [here's a slide from Honor's presentation](https://imgur.com/a/Dd5kVAX), seems like they're also bending components (somewhat like Apple is doing with OLED in the flagship X-line) to get such a small bezel on the bottom with LCD technology. and [here are chin sizes](https://imgur.com/a/Dww8F7M) of some android phones",382,260,2018-12-10,AAPL,0.03908767178654671,0.9246512651443481,0.03626108169555664

apple,PSA - Apple has been making the iPhone thicker while increasing battery life since the iPhone 6.,"I feel I see quite a lot of talk on /r/apple about how the iPhone would be so much better if they just made it thicker.  If we just had a thicker iPhone, we could have everything we wanted - more battery, more power, more storage, whatever.

Considering how much I see it, I bet most people here aren’t aware that **iPhones have been getting thicker for a long time.** See for yourself:

* iPhone 6:         **6.9mm**
* iPhone 6s/7:    **7.1mm**
* iPhone 8:         **7.3mm**
* iPhone X/Xs:   **7.7mm**
* iPhone Xr:       **8.3mm (!!!!)**

It doesn't make much sense to complain that Apple is sacrificing too much for thinness when they're really doing the opposite.  Apple's latest phone, the Xr has by far the longest battery life - even longer than the flagship Xs and even the Xs Max (which has the second longest).  How'd they pull this off?  I'm guessing that it helps a lot that they made the thing thicker.  It's the thickest iPhone since the iPhone 4.

Just keep this in mind the next time an article like [this](https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/19/2019-iphone/) comes floating around...

&amp;#x200B;

**Update**:  Many are pointing out that thickness does not necessarily mean larger batteries.  This is 100% true, and battery capacity has even gone down between a few of these generations (although, these have always come with more efficient processors, so battery life usually stayed the same, or went up slightly).  Over time, though, Apple has indisputably been both: 1) making phones thicker and larger 2) increasing the overall battery life.  Whether or not these two things are related, you can decide for yourself.

What is definitely true is that increasing the thickness of the iPhone has lead to many advancements we may not have gotten with thinner phones.  3D Touch, Haptic Engine, better speakers, more and better cameras, wireless charging - many of these likely would not have been possible without increasing the thickness of the phones.  So, regardless of how it has affected battery life, I am very thankful that Apple has not chosen to prioritize thinness above all else for the last few generations.

apple,Linus has come out with a surprisingly positive MacBook Air review.,"Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrQ1_X6gS4

I was honestly really surprised by this, especially after how picky he's been about Apple products recently.

It's probably even more of a positive review than other tech YouTubers like MKBHD and Dave2D. He captures the positives of the laptop really well, and surprisingly didn't mention the screen brightness which I thought would be a sticking point. 

His gripe about the ""lack"" of split-screen is a bit unfair considering there is split-screen integration in MacOS and all you have to do is Google it to find out, but otherwise he did a better job than most at explaining why the MacBook Air could be right for *you*, focusing on the simplicity of the OS compared to Windows. 

I'm not saying I agree with the review entirely having owned the new Air, but I just thought I'd share as I know this place doesn't necessarily have the best impression of Linus after a few of his videos this year and this is actually one of the fairest reviews I've seen for the Air so far.",392,549,2018-12-13,AAPL,0.02284844033420086,0.8552911281585693,0.12186043709516525

apple,"We get it: you like the size of your SE. No, it's not coming back. Sorry.","Edit: Copying a reply to comment I made down below to fill in the body of this post:  


Here's why I don't think the SE is coming back.  The iPhone SE was was created to utilize the existing manufacturing lines of the iPhone 5 and 5s during the 6 transition. It was a win-win: they could produce a modern phone at a much lower cost, without going through a full hardware and manufacturing design process.

The SE going away indicates that they've finished using those manufacturing lines, and to bring it back would require them to either a) Reintroduce a hardware form factor from 2010, or b) design a smaller phone from scratch. Both seem extremely unlikely. 

Even if they designed a new form factor, it's not it's not exactly easy to fit all the modern tech into a body with 30% less internal space.  There's a reason [iPhones have been getting bigger and thicker each year since the 6s](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/13/2019-iphones-thinner-samsung-displays/) - they need the internal space to fit this new tech.  So, a new SE would likely have outdated hardware, be riddled with compromises like poor battery life, and be very expensive to produce.  Not exactly a win for anyone.

Part of the issue, and Apple knows this, is that selling larger phones decreases demand for smaller ones. **For most people,** once you get used to larger phone, a smaller one just feels tiny and isn't very appealing. Apple has essentially eaten all the potential demand for the SE by selling larger phones.

Update: man, I really thought this was going to get downvoted/removed immediately.  Thanks for the mods for allowing this shitshow of a thread, and thanks for all the gold &amp; silver.  Stay awesome everyone.

Update 2: Lots of people seem to think that by saying Apple isn't bringing the SE back is a personal attack against them.  It's not.  I get it, you like smaller phones.  That's fine. The point of this post is to bring attention to the fact that *Apple* likely is never bringing this form factor back, and that it *wouldn't* be incredibly easy to do so like you think it would.

AppleWatch,Apple Watch saves me again,"I was on my way to a birthday party and pulled over to wrap the gift, it was a last minute thing and the card, wrapping and scissors were in my trunk. I finished wrapping it, and closed my trunk.

I told Siri to ""call USAA insurance"" and the dialing sound was just about the happiest I ever heard. I got stuck on automated customer service hell, but was able to navigate it using the built-in number pad in the Watch's phone app.  Finally I was able to reach a live human and get roadside assistance on its way, and the texted confirmation came right through of course to the watch, complete with the phone number for the local tow-truck service. I clicked on the number and called the tow-truck directly and see how long it would take to arrive.

15-minutes later the truck arrived and they were able to open my car.  If I hadn't had my watch on my wrist able to make calls it would have been extremely difficult to find my insurance number, let alone a phone to call it on.  This was a major mistake on my part locking my keys in the trunk, but it was extremely reassuring to have my little pocket phone / computer on my wrist to help me get out of a jam.  I feel like my Watch is now an essential back-up system for worst case scenarios like this.

TIP: Put your emergency numbers in your iPhone contact list. Like insurance, credit card companies, etc -- because once they're in Contacts they'll be easily accessible with Siri from your watch in a similar situation.",89,1356,2018-12-17,AAPL,0.052709028124809265,0.9200564026832581,0.027234526351094246

apple,Can we PLEASE stop defending Apple for poor design decisions?,"I recently had to get my iPhone X's screen replaced for the display touch issue and the ""Genius"" that set up the replacement gave me some sassy shit for my phone's rear glass looking like I took some sand paper to it and the fact my Stainless Steel black coating is coming off. She instantly said ""Well you should have had a case."" That's the same kinda crap that people here and other places say any time there is any kind of crap design choice Apple makes. It's down right infuriating to hear. The front glass of the iPhone X hasn't scratched at all from going in and out of my pocket. So they clearly CAN put glass on the back that would protect from that. The Apple Watch uses a higher grade coating on it's stainless steel which is why it won't begin to shed, or possibly never will. Me not using a case isn't an excuse when Apple already uses stronger methods on other products and sometimes on the same product. For a $1000 phone. 

I saw the same thing about BendGate and some people STILL refuse to admit that the phone's were structurally compromised. My 6 bend from just being in my front pocket. I replaced the rear case and that one ALSO bent. People gave shit to JerryRigEverything for showing how easily the new iPad Pro bent.

apple,Apple’s magic of brilliant Optimisation: iPhone XS Max (4GB RAM) vs OnePlus 6T (10GB RAM-McLaren Edition),"https://youtu.be/yqPXmwUiWWc

Credit: PhoneBuff. 

I saw this being posted a couple of times saying how insane it is that an Android phone has 10GB RAM, but optimisation does the trick without the need of all those numbers.. 

The fact that 4GB RAM phone can hold up, and even beat a 10GB RAM phone is mind boggling, to say the least. 

**EDIT:** 

*On a similar note, I thought I should address some recurring controversial takes on this issue..*

**“6T is more value for money tho..”**

*Yes, we know that. iPhone isn’t for those looking for bang for the buck kind of product.*

“**A $1400 phone is faster than a $500 one... WOW”**

*Despite its low price, the 6T is arguably the fastest Android phone out there. Coupled with flagship level SoC and 10GB RAM on the top of fast and light OxygenOS, this is probably the best performance you can get out of an Android phone, no matter the price.*

*Not to mention the 6T has beaten $1000 Android flagships. So this comparison is basically the ‘fastest Android vs fastest iPhone’ kind.*

**“RAM hasn’t got anything to do with speed and first lap”**

*Yes. It’s a speed test, a complete one. RAM might not matter for the first round, but it does in the second. The first round shows app launching times but the second round is what this post is about. Despite having 2.5 times **less** RAM, the iPhone keeps up with the 6T.*

*To the end user, it doesn’t matter what architecture their phone is using, they don’t care about the channels/memory bandwidth/(insert any other technical jargon) their phones have, they care about their apps being in the same place where they left it off. That’s the end result. That’s when your average joe concludes that his iPhone has amazing RAM management.*",660,1508,2018-12-19,AAPL,0.03663903474807739,0.9265544414520264,0.03680648282170296

apple,"Apple has been a mess lately, and they’ve got no one else to blame but themselves","I’ve always been an Apple user, I’m deeply invested into the Apple ecosystem and it comes as a disappointment to see where the company is headed in a new direction, which is anything but beneficial for the average consumer.

•It all started out in 2017, with **iOS 11**. Its universally accepted now that iOS 11 is one of the worst versions of iOS, full of bugs and issues. It was a mess, a big one. Imagine paying $1000 for a phone running an OS with countless random bugs and issues all over the place.

•The whole **“performance throttling”** fiasco, which was the worst. No matter how you out it, it IS shady of Apple to secretly throttle your devices without giving user any kind of reasoning to its customers. Although now they’ve fixed this, *after getting caught*

• Now, most of 2018 remained stable up until they announced the **iPhone XS and XR**. This year the improvements are minimal, with the only major “upgrade” coming in the form of pricing. A 15% faster processor with a new colour goes all the way up to $1400. How on earth can you justify this? 

There’s a limit on how high you can price your products, even for a company like Apple.

*Addition: The current WiFi and cellular connection issues have also plagued a lot many users. It’s not acceptable for a $1000 phone to have this kind of issue.*

•XR, the phone that almost everyone said is **“going to sell like hot cakes”** is doing pretty bad. It’s quite evident by countless reliable reports mentioning the recent cut in estimate and production followed by Apple’s desperate marketing attempts to sell it. 

It’s not too hard to see why this product isn’t doing well, because most of the people justified it by saying “The display is not THAT bad”. A very compelling argument for a $800 phone. 

• **How did I miss this?** 
AirPower! Announced in 2017, still not released yet. 

• The whole **“What’s a Computer”** marketing, but iOS more or less remains the same... lacking in dozens of features that would’ve made the iPad a serious PC contender. 

•Talking about iPad? The new **BendGate 2018** edition. Everybody gave *JerryRigEverything* tons of crap for his controversial video. Now Apple has openly come out to accept that the new iPad IS prone to bending issues. What’s more? They don’t consider it a defect that would “hinder performance”. Nice justification for a $1000 tablet, Apple.

•Apple’s messed up MacBook lineup is another example. The MBA is at a confusing place between the 12” MB and 13” MBP, plus the lack of ports for the “Pros”. 

This leaves one to wonder, what kind of marketing are they doing and why? They just need to build their products well and cut down on pricing a bit, is it so hard to understand?

Putting up a dozen more billboards telling me ‘how amazing the XR is’ wont make me buy it, but giving it a $100 price cut will. 

This displays their arrogance and stubborn attitude which is not a good news for Apple users. 

*I’m still an Apple user and will remain one for the foreseeable future. This is because giving up my Mac, iPad, iPhone and replacing them all with something else would be a costly decision and despite it’s flaws, Apple’s integration remains unparalleled... I won’t be upgrading, but I’ll continue with what I have already bought for some time...*

*I like their products, just not the way they’ve been marketing and pricing them. It’s disappointing to see a company like Apple take this route.*

apple,FYI: Apple charges more for repairs if new iPad Pro is bent,"As reported here (Service Eligibility Guidelines | [iPhone](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/4/16251200/apple-leaked-iphone-warranty-guide-repair-replace) | [iPad](https://i.imgur.com/ESzCWwf.png)) and as other users have reported over several years, if Apple finds it bent, your iPad Pro ~~is~~ may no longer be eligible for Warranty Service.

* Meaning they will charge you an Out-Of-Warranty Service fee, which means your Apple Care won't save you

* Although, perhaps, you may be able to use one of your two ""accidental damage"" incidents

* One user reported a $60 repair becoming a $600 repair when an Apple Genius discovered their 12.9"" iPad Pro was bent, unbeknown to the owner prior to bringing it in for an unrelated repair. They said the genius used a caliper-ruler to measure bend, and said it was ineligible for the original warranty repair price. (I can't confirm this story since I wasn't there; take it with grains for salt, but it seems about right given similar responses regarding bent edges on devices)

This is all to warn you to check your iPad Pro for bends, and to consider that just trusting Apple that there are no consequences to this bend may be false once you bring it in for an unrelated repair.

apple,PSA : bent new iPad Pros are NOT OK because you might not be able to replace the battery later,"I have a friend who has an iPhone 6. As you might know, the iPhone 6 had the infamous ""bendgate"" problem. Basically the casing material was too soft and would bend very easily.

When he wanted to replace his battery with the 29$ program, he was told it's not possible because his case was bent. He didn't even notice it was bent because he had it in a case and frankly not visible until you use a caliper.

So it ll be the same if you get a bent iPad. If you can see that it's bent with your bare eyes, it means its seriously bent. Should you want to replace its battery later, you'll probably be not able to because it's bent.

You should measure your iPad with a caliper after you open it.

apple,PSA: The iPad’s keyboard gestures are more robust than you might think,"The iPad actually has quite a few options for text selection that I don’t always see mentioned here, including a few that I don’t think even 3D Touch iPhones have. There’s the obvious one:

• Swipe with two fingers to move cursor.

But there’s also

• Tap and hold with two fingers to begin selecting, then move fingers to expand selection, OR

• Tap once with two fingers to select single word.

• Double tap with two fingers to select sentence.

• Triple tap with two fingers to select paragraph.

While text is selected:

• Swipe left/up with two fingers to move left selection handle.

• Swipe right/down with two fingers to move right selection handle.

* Tap once with two fingers to exit selection and return to cursor mode.

The cursor position will return to either:

* The beginning of the previous selection, if you adjusted the handles to make your selection, OR

* The spot of the previous cursor, before you entered selection mode, if you selected text using the single/double/triple tap to select option and did not adjust the size of the selection.

I hope these are useful for some of you!",94,1531,2018-12-22,AAPL,0.028765296563506126,0.9392091035842896,0.032025646418333054

apple,Are these New iPad Pros Bent? Apple says No.,"I took my New iPad Pro 3rd Gen 256gb WiFi + Cellular to the Apple Store to exchange because it is bent. They replaced it a few days later with another iPad Pro, which was bent even more than the original. Now, Apple has refused to exchange the device for one that isn’t bent. What should I do?

apple,Apple really needs to give more attention to Apple Music,"* Play counts for songs don't sync properly across devices (ie iPhone, Mac, &amp; Apple TV)
&gt; Ex) This information is interesting and I like looking at it. Important play count information would be accurate for potential future usage of Siri such as saying ""play my most listened to Portugal. The Man and MGMT songs"")

* No Handoff feature
&gt; Ex) If I have a queue of songs on my Mac or Apple TV, I want to be able to quickly get that on my iPhone if I have to leave in my car to go somewhere.

* No BPM data for any songs
&gt; Ex) This would give Apple a huge edge on competitors like Spotify. BPM data is useful for creating playlists and surely Apple can figure can figure out a way to automate this entire process for every Apple Music song

* No higher tier plan for hi-fi audio ($19.99 per month)
&gt; Ex) I listen to music for hours every day. I listen to 1-7 new albums per week. I'm willing to pay extra to have hi-fidelity audio for Apple Music songs. I think the best way to do this would be to select which existing songs in my library I want to convert to hi-fi. That way play counts, date added, and playlists are all retained.

* Doesn't have end of the year stats like Spotify
&gt; Ex) If Apple figured out play counts and got it to sync properly between devices this shouldn't be hard for Apple to implement

* Improve track listing and results in Search
&gt; Ex) It's confusing when searching for songs and I get 5 results for the same song. Apple should highlight the result that is the best one. For example when I search ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" the proper album version is the sixth result. Greatest hits albums and the movie versions are ranked higher. Apple Music should at least have an option to bump the album version to the top. This is useful if you want to go back in the future and listen to more songs from that album

* Music videos aren't in great quality... So why even have them?
&gt; Ex) I think the best I have seen is 720p. If it's 1080p on YouTube why even have them on Apple Music?

* Doesn't create smart playlists based on songs I listen to frequently or during certain times of the day
&gt; Ex) I want to be able to say ""Hey Siri, play King Gizzard songs that I listen to on the way to work very early in the morning""

* Special edition albums bought in iTunes that aren't available on Apple Music don't show up on my Apple Music profile
&gt; Ex) InnerSpeaker (Collector's Edition) by Tame Impala specifically. Just make a change so anything bought in iTunes shows up in Apple Music. I don't know. I guess this isn't as important.

* Duplicate genres showing in iTunes/Music app
&gt; Ex) Give users a way to merge genres in desktop app? I have 3 genres for Hip Hop/ Rap all titled the same thing.

* If an artist uploads a single to Apple Music, removes it, then includes it with the full album, then I want the option to convert the single into the album version so that it still has my play count &amp; playlists. Same goes for reuploads and remasters of other albums
&gt; Ex) The Star Wars 1-6 soundtracks were remastered last summer and the old albums were removed from Apple Music. This messed up playlists I had. I want to be able to convert the old files to the new files while retaining playlists and other information

* I want to be able to add lengthier descriptions to my playlists (or even albums as well)
&gt; Ex) Below an album I want to write a description like ""I discovered this album in 2014 when I was friends with so and so.. etc etc) Also for playlists that I share on my Apple Music profile I want to add a lengthy description.
&gt; Ex2) If a band I like has over 20 albums, I want to be able to create a playlist of all of their albums and then list out all of their albums in the description while being able to use tab, enter, bullets etc.

* Create smart playlists based off songs I like with high tempo and BPM automatically
&gt; Ex) automatically categorize songs that are calm and then much heavier

* If I delete an album from my library I don't want to see it popping up in my recommendations every day
&gt; Ex) Talking about that first Royal Blood album. Sorry guys... :/",651,4963,2018-12-29,AAPL,0.03625273331999779,0.9276439547538757,0.036103326827287674

apple,Potential Privacy Issue With Apple Wallet,"Hey guys,

I added my credit card to my Apple Wallet and I went to pay for something and I noticed that the billing address &amp; name were wrong. I went to the card in my Apple Wallet and clicked on Billing Address and to my surprise, there are over 100 addresses and names on this list. I do not recognize ANY of them. They are from throughout the United States. My phone was purchased brand-new (iPhone XS Max) from Verizon, so I am not sure why I am able to see all of this info. Any help would be appreciated, I don't know if this is just affecting me, or others. 

UPDATE: I spoke to Apple Support and the rep said that they didn’t know why this happened. Since there was no sign of any data compromise, she told me I can delete all of the contacts. Of course I’ll have to do this individually, which is a total pain. She did mention that this has occurred before but there is no reason why.",155,605,2018-12-30,AAPL,0.159001424908638,0.8154435157775879,0.025555012747645378
apple,Apple: What is the point of AirPods in Find My Phone if they need to be connected to locate?,"Given that the location data is not going to be any more accurate than “your AirPods are in pretty much the same location as your phone” I don’t understand the point of AirPods even being listed. 

You can’t put them in lost mode (which is ridiculous given that it would just be a serial number linked to an Apple ID) and you can’t see the last connected location after more than about 24 hours. What’s the point?

I have two sets of AirPods and one set have failed on me. They are easily mixed up so I thought I had the good pair with me. Turns out I must have misplaced them but have no way to see where I last used because both sets show as Offline in Find My Phone.

Side note: I know that you used to be able to see last connected location for a significant amount of time however functionality appears to have been removed.",107,463,2018-12-30,AAPL,0.13118460774421692,0.8472135663032532,0.021601812914013863
