apple,Time to end this dispute once and for all xpost /r/android,"On such a crazy day, I figured today would be a good day to finally end this dispute about the Galaxy S6 looking exactly like the iPhone 6.  

My argument will be split in three parts,  but first some release dates

+ HTC One M7  March 2013
+ Xperia z2  March 2014
+ Galaxy Alpha August 2014
+ Xperia Z3 September 19 2014 (tie)
+ iPhone 6   September 19 2014 (tie)
+ Galaxy A5 November 2014  
+ Galaxy S6  April 2015 


**Part 1:** The Galaxy S6 evolved form the Galaxy Alpha line (speaker grill, central usb, vertical antenna lines vs horizontal lines like the iphone 6). Here you can see the difference between the 

Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy Alpha vs Iphone 6 

http://i.imgur.com/KSEOuIW.jpg

And the bottom headphone/vertical antennas are also seen in the Galaxy A5 

http://i.imgur.com/TL3BPRm.jpg

**Part 2:** Yes I agree that the bottom of the Galaxy S6 looks similar to the iPhone 6, but it is not an exact copy. In similar fashion the iPhone 6 has design  cues from other phones 

Iphone 6 vs HTC M7 metal back with horizontal antenna bands 

http://i.imgur.com/u8ohgX4.jpg

iPhone 6 vs Xperia Z line rounded metal

The Z2 was first to use symmetrically rounded metal edges (as opposed to a round back that flattens at the front like several other phones). The Z3 continued this by removing the small flat lip on the sides

Z2 vs z3 

http://i.imgur.com/0o1KskN.jpg

Both the Z3 and the iPhone 6 share completely round edges 

http://i.imgur.com/JbNdSQX.png


**Part 3:** Except for the bottom (which do look similar) The Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6 look very different at almost every other angle (especially the edge version). The feel in the hand is also very different

apple,iPad needs Mac's Preview.app,"iPad is [heavily branded as an educational device](https://www.apple.com/education/ipad/). And Apple has done a great job on following through on that promise: [iTunes U](https://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/) is a great tool for learning, as are [iBooks Textbooks](https://www.apple.com/education/ipad/ibooks-textbooks/). Yet these tools can't handle the most common file format in universities, which is the PDF. PDFs are not only the standard format for all downloadable scientific publications, they're also the standard format for student papers and scanned documents. These need to be read critically, and critical reading of these documents necessitates annotation tools. It necessitates highlighting, drawing lines and arrows, and writing text on the side. 

Close reading through Thomas Hobbes' 1655 *De Corpore* is no easy task, but by structuring it using annotations I'll understand it better than many readers. Mac's Preview.app is great for this because it's lightweight, easy, and makes everything look great. My annotations, for example, might look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/BeAWm8n.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/2VqQpUF.png). 

Now, even though it's apparently [iPad's 5th anniversary](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/31apfz/the_first_ipad_arrived_five_years_ago_today/), trying to do annotations of PDFs on iPad is one big and tiring hassle. First, since there is no Preview.app on iPad, there's also no continuity feature between Macs and iPads for reading PDFs. What is built-in is a department within iPad's iBooks.app where you can stash PDFs that you AirDrop to yourself - but you don't get the annotation tools that are available for eBooks. 

Therefore, you turn to third-party solutions, of which none have a continuity feature between iPad and Mac because that would require the third-party to come up with an alternative to Mac's Preview.app, which is senseless because Mac's Preview.app is already the perfect solution for dealing with PDFs. So you give up continuity - no big deal, because it's fairly new anyway right? - and what you're left with is apps that make a total mess out of their user interfaces and which annotation colors don't correspond to the Preview.app's annotation colors, which is hell if you use different colors to color code text structure.

In conclusion and in TL;DR, iPad needs a Preview.app to be an educational tool of value.

iphone,"How my app Hooks - Alerts for Everything got featured on the App Store and TechCrunch, all thanks to Redditors that motivated me to keep working another 4 month","**Thanks to everyone**

My first [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/2mi0fy/i_spent_last_4_month_working_hard_developing/) on /r/iphone really motivated me to keep working on Hooks!

I've received many messages from Reddit users offering help, talked on skype with many who just wanted to help without asking for anything.

3 weeks ago I launched Hooks 2.0 with new design, new UI, new everything, removed sign-up, reached 100+ channels and 1M+ alerts to choose from all based on users feedback. I keep adding new alerts as fast as I can.

**About Hooks**

Hooks is a free app that allows anyone to monitor and receive notifications about the things that are most important to them from anywhere in the world e.g. GOT new episode, new post on Reddit with 100+ votes, Lakers-Hornets games results, new review on the App Store for your app, new video games releases with X points on Metacritic, users activity on social websites, youtube, twitch and 1M+ things to choose from.

**App Store Feature**

Today I woke up, opened the App Store and it was there! Hooks have been featured! It's a very nice feeling when your work get noticed!

*****
**Guidelines**  

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.  
* **One app per comment.**
* Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS and OS X are both game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a sentence or two, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc) because everyone knows about them.

**Last month's top five suggestions:**  

1. [Desert Golfing (iOS, $1.99)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desert-golfing/id902062673?mt=8) - Endless 2d golf game. Best time waster game I've ever played. 743 holes in. - /u/Vindictus7

2. [Duet Display(iOS, $14.99)](http://www.duetdisplay.com) - I just discovered this when I was looking for another monitor to use with my MacBook Air when at my desk. It allows you to used your iOS device (I use the iPad Air) as a second monitor. It is great for getting all of my schoolwork done so that I can pull up info on the iPad screen while keeping my MacBook free of clutter.  - /u/SixthSnail

3. [Nokia Here Maps (iOS, free)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id955837609) - Nokia Here reached the app store a few days ago. After using apple maps &amp; google maps for a while, I subscribed to the beta of ""Here"" and have used it for approximately 1 month. From my experience, ""Here"" just works great, both from UI standpoint and map data. The key differentiator is that you can download the maps and use them offline - just like on a GPS, as a pack - for free. ""Here"" maps is one of the thing I missed the most when replacing my lumia by an iphone, and I certainly advise you to check it out. - /u/nbuet

4. [Hooks - Alerts for Everything (iOS, Free)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id923353363) - Hooks will send you a notification for anything you care about: when Lakers wins Hornets, Your App gets a review on App Store, new post in subReddit gets X points, GOT new episode has aired, new Game/Album/Movie is released and gets X score on Metacritic, new stream started on Twitch and 1M+ to choose from. - /u/Faizan03

5. [Alto's Adventure \(iOS Universal, $1.99\)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/altos-adventure/id950812012?mt=8) - A beautiful new endless snowboarding runner. The mechanics are essentially the same as [ski safari](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/ski-safari/id503092422?mt=8) however this one is miles better in terms of aesthetics. What's more is that the dev appreciates the grind system so there are **no IAPs or paywall** and the only way to level up your power ups is through playing the game and collecting the coins.  - /u/Ayvias

Those of you who thought it was ridiculous when it happened to the iPhone should agree that it's equally ridiculous with Samsung. Therefore, we want to keep it out of this subreddit.

So just to elaborate on Rule #6, it's fine to post a link about specific comparisons between the iPhone and another device. Features, engineering, etc are all okay because it's directly related to Apple. It's *not* okay to post a link that has nothing to do with Apple other than it being Apple's competition. We've already removed several links to Samsung's official response to bending, for example.

In the same way, we will be removing comments in this thread that serve no purpose except to rant about Samsung's hypocrisy or engineering.

I read that a battery swap fixes this problem, but last night I tried my own solution because I'm too impatient to wait for a battery to be shipped to me. 
Basically, I punctured a very tiny hole in the battery casing to release the air from the battery, which is what was causing the bloat. I tried sealing the hole with a dab of superglue and I think it worked. 

So, can this hole that I poked in the battery casing be dangerous? Should I worry about whether or not the superglue actually did seal it?

apple,"The reason Apple Watch is being called ""slow"".","I'm sure some of you have already seen this, but here's one plausible solution as to why the watch exhibits sluggish behavior at times. I've stumbled upon this on MacRumors. Original thread can be found [here.] (http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1864029) Comment was by user ""bbeagle"".


&gt; It seems after the Verge review, that people think the Apple Watch is slow.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm an iOS developer so I'll explain this a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a fluid OS - the OS is not the issue, it's how the Apple Watch deals with 3rd party app updates. Any Apple native apps are fluid, but 3rd party 'glances' show their GUI first, THEN query the iPhone for an update, transfer the data, and then show the results.
&gt; 
&gt; 3rd party apps are forced to work this way right now. Apple does not allow 3rd party code to run on the actual watch. All 3rd party code must run on the phone and transfer data via bluetooth to the watch. So, say you click a button on the watch (in a 3rd party app), the watch must then tell the phone over bluetooth that the button was clicked, the phone then does the processing/web requests, then when done, tells the watch over bluetooth what to display on the screen next. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, this will be slow, and work this way, until probably September. I'm guessing new Watch APIs will be introduced at WWDC in June, then released as part of iOS 9. 
&gt; 
&gt; Apple apps don't need this round-trip watch-phone-watch interaction, thus are snappy. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is one reason you won't see many games on the watch at launch. Card games, tic-tac-toe games will be fine. But action games are too slow. Maybe some savvy developer can figure out a way to use animated gifs and a slower reaction time to make something interesting, but they'll be rare until September.",179,227,2015-04-09,AAPL,0.03154075890779495,0.9342848062515259,0.03417443856596947

apple,The Apple Watch - Totally Different in Person,"Just went and tried the Apple Watch on for myself just to make sure that I made the right decision as far as size/band/model. The experience was totally different than I expected:

* I couldn't tell the difference between the 38mm and the 42mm until it was on my wrist.

* Compared to what I predicted using the app and cutouts, the Watch is tiny!

* The sport is gorgeous but the Stainless Steel stole my heart. Anyone who ordered the sport will not be disappointed in the slightest, but if you are questioning, the s/s is worth the extra money for purely the aesthetic aspect.

* I looked very hard and couldn't see any difference between the Sport and Stainless Steel screen. Air gap my ass. 

* Force touch = awesome.

* The Digital Crown is much more sensitive then I thought it would be.

* The bands were very different in person. Especially the leather loop (which I loved in pictures, not so much in person) and the Sport Band (which I wasn't sure of in pictures, and loved in person).

apple,My 170mm wrists wearing a 38mm vs. 42mm Sport watch,"Here are some photos from my try-on session today. Hopefully they can help people with my wrist size pick a size. The 42mm was smaller than I thought it would be, but I think the 38mm looked better as an object on my wrist. That being said, since the device was in a demo loop, I don't know if there are any significant usability differences between the two sizes. All of the demo units that you could actually play with were 42mm.

Personally, I am leaning strongly towards the 38mm. I'm also very glad I didn't pre-order at midnight because seeing the watches in person is incredibly different from seeing them in pictures.

Some thoughts:

* The stainless steel is really nice. Like, exponentially nicer than the sport model. I was dead-set on buying the cheapest watch, but honestly, having seen them side-by-side, I no longer like the sport model as much. The silver aluminum doesn't look very ""watch-y"" whereas the black aluminium looks very gadgety, like something from a sci-fi movie. Now I'm kind of torn between my vanity and my frugality.

* The gold looks amazing in person. I'm not going to buy one, but wow.

* The milanese loop was a let-down. It was not very comfortable, it was fiddly to adjust it to get it to fit snugly and a bit of a hassle to put on/take off. I didn't find it looked nearly as elegant as I thought it would in my mind.

* The rubber bracelets are very comfortable. However, they look really casual and wouldn't pair well with anything other than sportswear or certain styles of streetwear. Forget about wearing these to the office.

* I've read some people here saying that the colours of the sport bands are quite muted/subtle/etc. I couldn't disagree more. They are **bright!** Eye-catchingly bright. It's like wearing a homing beacon on your wrist.

* The taptic feedback was a lot subtler than I was expecting. I was told I'd be able to turn up the intensity in the watch settings, but the default was very slight. At times I barely registered the tap.

apple,It's GORGEOUS!,"Pics below-- There doesn't seem to be any posts specifically warning people about this so I'm writing this as a message for people who were ordering based on the pictures to see the models in person on your wrist first-- ESPECIALLY IF YOU PREORDERED. It makes a big difference as in person as some models and bands look dramatically better than others in images. 

**Things the pictures don't show:**


I found that in general, the weight of the Sport felt a lot lighter (about 30% according to the rep). with the sport band I could barely feel that it's there. The sports band is very comfortable and flexible and it looks great-- the black sports band doesn't look ""athletic"" from far. The bands really make a difference in how it looks. 

The dark Gray was subtle and felt luxurious, but the stainless steel felt like a high end luxury product because of its weight and texture. Also, the magnetic click in the modern band feels like magic. 

I thought the SS was gorgeous, but it's personal-- [here's an image /u/metalhaze took](http://f.cl.ly/items/0a3h1L0e150A2y042K3g/11149268_671047499667060_6900096724559886374_n.jpg) of the Milanese band. Certain bands look much better on the wrist than in the photos-- but it depends on your tastes. It's very personal and depends on your style of dress and color preference.

The screen on the 38mm FEELS smaller. The font size is smaller, the screen feels smaller. I'm not saying you'll squint but the 42 feels more comfortable in comparison.

It did seem thick when it's off, but it's rounded so it doesn't feel that way on your wrist, or look thick. It's no thicker than my previous Omega watch, which was standard. The part that touches your skin is very smooth and comfortable.

The space Gray sport almost has a matte grey sports car paint look, but is brighter and works well with coloured bands. The SS is absolutely beautiful to me, but my friend (who wanted the Gray SS initially) decided to order the Sport instead.


The Gray SS is an amazingly beautiful piece of tech-- this is very personal though as my friend felt the exact opposite and preferred the Sport much more once it was on his wrist. The pictures from the website doesn't even come close to doing it justice and I have no clue why they aren't showing it on the wrist. I didn't have enough time to take pictures, but the point is that the pictures are NOT necessarily indicative anyway, so go take a look.

If you've preordered, don't cancel it, but go to the store and try on the model you ordered and compare it to either a different size or different colour band. This way you can still change the order before it arrives. 

It makes the Moto 360 look like an oversized toy (to me, personally-- please stop sending me hate mail!). Even the 42 mm now seems a bit big on my wrist, though that's the one I ended up with (I have a 160mm wrist).  If you have a small wrist, definitely try on the 38 mm first. 

I asked my friend to send me his photos for comparison. His wrist size is 170mm.

apple,Here's an 15 picture album of the watches I tried on today(with side views too!). 160mm wrist. Both 38 and 42mm sport and stainless steel variants.,"ALBUM: http://imgur.com/a/n2CDH

As the title suggests. Got to try on both 38mm and 42mm of both the sport and stainless steel variants. I have a 160mm wrist, or so I think from the measurements I've taken. I ordered the 42mm sport with the white band at midnight. After going and trying things on, the 38mm would have fit me better, but I also don't mind the 42mm size as it's not HUGE. We'll see once I get it in on the 24th and spend a couple of days with it.


Some personal opinions that may not be applicable to others:


-Glad I purchased the sport version to be honest. I -love- the stainless steel, don't get me wrong. But it's not worth $200 more in my opinion.


-The sport band is super nice.


-The classic buckle is nice, but not worth the $150 extra I think. I expected something of better quality for that price.


-Link bracelet is also nice. Not really my style. I personally would have a hard time paying $450 for it though(I am a college student, so I am biased though).


-The watch is gorgeous in person. Easily the best looking smart watch I've seen.


-Native apps are super fast. I was testing it out, and was very surprised at how fast things were after reading the Verge's article/review.",81,147,2015-04-11,AAPL,0.024441247805953026,0.9160599112510681,0.05949881300330162

Since I found it hard to get an idea of scale from all the comparison photos, I stopped by the Apple Store today to try one on. Sorry I didn't take a photo of a 38mm. However, I did hold it over my wrist and it did look too small, even for my smaller wrists. I'm about 5'6 with ~165mm (~6.5 in.) wrists. Hope this helps anyone trying to gauge how proportional it looks on a body.

Fast forward to yesterday. I go to look at an album my sister shares with me , not there. And then in photos I see a whole bunch of selfies of two little kids. I assume from that iPad.  
When i got my new iPad I linked it to my iCloud, so I assume the old one would have been disabled, guess not.
What do I do from here?

I have a Late 2009 17-inch MacBook Pro. Something that I'll do whatever I can to keep it running (for the obvious reasons). Within the past year when I used FaceTime, there seemed to be a 50/50 chance that the mic/speaker assembly would malfunction.  This created a loud popping noise, and the other line not being able to hear me.

I finally made an appointment, took it in, and they said they'd try replacing the speaker.  With a 50/50 chance that the issue might be from the logic board instead.  50 dollars and 4 days later I got my machine back. Arriving home I noticed that when I closed the lid it would no longer sleep. Running a magnet over the sensor proved something was wrong so I brought it back to Apple the follow day.

The Genius took it to the back to run some tests and came out to tell me they would have to ship it out for further repairs because they did not have the part in-store, but that it would be a free repair (sweet!).

Today, when I went to pick up the machine for the second time, the Genius handed it to me and it was different.  They'd replaced the entire assembly, the hard drive, optical drive, both RAM cards, and the bluetooth card. For free. Needless to say I'm amazed, and quite happy. 

I haven't been able to test whether or not the initial issue is still present, currently waiting for the Time Machine to restore. But it sleeps when I close it.  

The customer service is still in my opinion the best there is.  They didn't ask any questions and where entirely ready to do what they had to make sure my machine worked and that I was satisfied. This company makes me so happy sometimes.

However, the I just received a call from the buyer claiming it's still connected to my email. I suppose he restored the phone and that somehow it still needs the password to the email it's connected to? How is this even possible? The iPhone 4S is nowhere to be found on any of my accounts when I look at my devices, however, I can still see my own personal devices.

He even claimed to have called Apple, and they apparently said it's connected to my old email. I have no idea if this is true, so I'm just going to take his word for it.

Can someone please help me? What could possibly be the cause?

Here's an album of my unboxing (obviously not pretty pictures). http://imgur.com/a/L6JQT I hope your experience is just as exciting! 

The learning curve is definitely large, which is strange for me but I enjoy exploring. The apple videos were definitely helpful when trying to understand different settings. I'll be spending my day testing the accuracy of the activity monitor against my Fitbit.

Happy Apple Watch Release day!

apple,Things I've done with my Apple Watch in just 24 hours,"Keep in mind all of these things were not even out of a blatant attempt to use them, but they just assisted me throughout the natural course of my day.


-First received the headline about the Nepal Earthquake.


-Controlled my Apple TV

-Instantly disregarded unimportant emails without having to take my phone out.

-Used Apple Pay in a cab, a grocery and in the airport. This was just awesome and so easy.


-Responded to text messages with dictation, quick-replies, and emojis.


-Got the weather directly off of my watch-face (as a New Yorker our lives are dictated by the weather).


-Accepted a call and had a conversation over the speaker. The person on the other end reported that the audio quality was great.


-Shared flirtatious taps, drawings, and heartbeats with my girlfriend (who has one too).


-Controlled my podcast remotely on the go (makes it super easy to skip past those pesky ads).


-Yoga workout -- got to see a calorie reading (never knew how much it burned) and complete my activity circle for the day


-Checked in for my flight, and used it as a boarding pass (some of the airport employees hand never seen it before and were pretty shocked). This was super convenient as we each had two heavy bags to carry.


-Compared heartrates with my girlfriend as our plane took off (we're both nervous fliers and our heartrates were elevated). We wanted to see who would remain more calm.


-And course had the time on my wrist-- something I haven't had for at least ten years... So it's great to have immediately available.


I can't imagine this device won't be a huge success... particularly when future software and hardware updates bring even more exciting features.

apple,Weekend of traveling with the Apple Watch,"I picked up my watch from UPS at 845 in the morning on Friday. I set it up on my way to the airport where I was off to Portland for the weekend. The watch was way more useful than I thought it would be. Just using it for my boarding pass was such an interesting new experience from the start. Everywhere we went I would use maps on my watch, say the location, and it would tap the directions all the way there. If you're walking in a city, where you would normally be looking at your phone for directions, this experience is far superior. Just glancing down and it saying turn left at X street in 900ft is so much nicer than holding your phone or looking at the next direction every turn. It rained a lot so I kept my phone in my pocket basically the whole time and the watch did all the work. For photos the shutter app is surprisingly cool. Being able to see what the camera sees so you can perfectly frame yourself in the shot is something I've never experienced. For the majority of my messages I was able to use the quick responses and dictation is accurate almost every time. As far as battery goes I unplugged it at 845am Saturday morning and used it all day with maps, texting, Instagram, checking activity, checking weather, paying for Starbucks, and watching the jellyfish swim across my wrist. Getting home at 1230am I had 23% power left. I can't imagine using it more than I did yesterday and it still easily made it the through.

apple,My thoughts on the Apple watch after three days (long review),"These are my thoughts on the Apple watch after using it for 3 days.

**Usefulness and ease of use**

The watch’s different functions fit into a hierarchy of usefulness and ease of use that looks like this (in order from most useful to least useful):

1. Timekeeping
2. Complications
3. Notifications
4. Glances
5. Apps

Looking down at your watch to see the time is the easiest, most obvious, and most useful function of the watch. Complications are a close second, since they’re displayed on the watch face and you just have to look at them. However, finding and launching an app is much longer, more complicated, and less immediately rewarding.

As a result, my enjoyment of the watch tends to hinge on what I’m doing with it. If I’m glancing at it as I step out the door to check if I need a scarf, it’s brilliant. If I receive a Dark Sky notification that it’s going to rain, amazing. But if I have to ask Siri for directions to a place or I launch the Transit app to see when the next bus passes, it’s a much slower and more frustrating experience.

**The watch face**

Overall, I’m pleased with this. I use the [modular face](http://i.imgur.com/zjGkZHi.png), which lets you see a ton of information at a glance. What’s even better is that you can tap on any complication to instantly launch the associated app. For instance, I can tap on today’s date to launch the calendar, or on the temperature to launch the weather app.

I feel like customization options are too limited. There aren’t very many watch faces (and some of them are very similar). Sometimes you can only fit 3 complications onto a watch face when there should be room for 4. The list of potential complications to choose from is limited to default Apple stuff (like alarms, timers, weather, date, and stocks).

The more I think about it, the more I think complications are the most prized real estate on the watch. If Apple allowed you to add 3rd-party complications to a watch face, that would be amazing.

**Notifications**

I have nothing but good things to say about these. The controls for what you receive or don’t receive from your phone are very granular. Even iPhone apps that don’t support the watch can have their notifications forwarded to it and they mimic the iPhone notification perfectly. For example, I use Calendars 5, which has an option to snooze an event alarm by 5, 15, or 30 minutes. When I receive those alarms on my watch, I can snooze them the same way I can on my phone, or I can dismiss the alert. Same with emails received from Outlook: I can archive or delete an email straight from the watch.

The little red dot that lets you know you have notifications is really prominent (I would actually like to see this on the iPhone) and it’s very fast to swipe down and look at them.

**Glances**

These are decent. They’re quick to load, show a bare minimum of essential information, and tapping on them once takes you to the full app. I thought navigating between them would be slow, but in fact you can “fast swipe” between them and skip over several glances a once to reach the one you want. It’s pretty quick. It would be cool to be able to zoom through these with the crown, but you can’t.

3rd-party app glances are currently pretty bad. Some don’t load at all, some take a while to load, most haven’t figured out how to take advantage of such a small screen. I expect this to improve with time, though.

**Apps**

This is the most frustrating part of the watch. First, I find it’s a bit awkward to have to press the crown and then tap on the app to launch it. It’s just not a seamless experience. Navigating away from an app is frustrating as well. In practice, I find that double-clicking to multitask does not work well, so you have to tap the crown once to return to the app screen, tap it again to centre the apps, and tap it a third time to return to the watch face. Bleh. This is especially painful while you’re walking.

I don’t like that you can’t remove default Apple apps from this screen. There are tons that I don’t need.

3rd-party apps are currently not up to snuff. As you’ve surely seen elsewhere, they’re slow, ill-adapted to the small screen, and just generally amateurish. There are some exceptions, and I suspect that this situation will improve as developers get a better grasp of the platform.

**Haptic feedback**

I am so disappointed with this feature. The bottom line is that the vibration isn’t nearly strong enough. I have haptic set to maximum and prominent haptic is turned on.

When I’m at my desk or sitting at home, I can almost always tell I’ve received something. However, I missed a ton of text messages while I was simply out walking because I couldn’t feel them. I also rode my bike for a few hours with turn-by-turn directions and I almost never felt the watch vibrate over the vibration of the bicycle forks.

There are different vibrations for different functions. A finished timer buzzes insistently over and over. A text message is just a gentle “purr” and sometimes I wonder if I’ve received something or just imagined it (you know when you feel a phantom phone vibration in your pocket? It feels a bit like that). The left-turn/right-turn patterns for turn-by-turn directions are not distinct enough from one another, in my opinion.

This is my biggest disappointment, I think. I was really, really hoping that an Apple watch would be the end of missed calls and text messages; would be the end of having to constantly pull out my phone and look at it for directions; would be the end of wondering if I really received a notification or just imagined it. But it’s not, and it sucks. These need: a) the option to be set much stronger; b) the option to be customized by the user, the same way as phone notifications.

**Raising your wrist to glance at the watch**

This sort of works. Or rather, sometimes it works amazingly well, and sometimes it doesn’t and it’s just frustrating.

If you make a really distinct movement with your wrist, the watch will turn on. That’s super cool. However, if the movement is a bit more subtle, the watch only turns on some of the time. For instance, when I’m typing on my keyboard like I am now, my wrist is already in such a position that the watch is facing up. If I turn my watch a little bit towards me to check the time, sometimes it turns on and sometimes it doesn’t. When this fails, you have to tap on the watch screen to activate it.

The watch has a power-saving feature where if you glance at your it and then lower your wrist, or even rotate it a bit, the watch will turn itself off. However, in practice, this sometimes means that the watch turns its screen off while you’re in the middle of doing something because it detected a slight movement of your wrist. This is incredibly frustrating. I’m not sure, but I’m beginning to think that if you’re wearing a long-sleeved shirt and your cuff covers part of the watch face, it will sometimes turn itself off. Annoying, as well.

Another thing that’s frustrating is that the raise to glance feature seems to get sluggish over time. After a full day playing with apps, checking maps, and so forth, I find that the watch is slower to register a wrist raise. Restarting the watch seemed to clear out whatever was causing the slowdown and make raising to glance snappy again, but I shouldn’t have to do that.

**Battery life &amp; charging**

Battery life is incredible. I have the 38mm watch. I generally put on my watch at 8:30AM and take it off at midnight. Even after playing with it a lot due to first weekend excitement, the watch has never dropped bellow 30% by the end of the day. I don’t think Apple will make any serious effort to increase battery life in the future. So long as you charge the watch every night, you don’t need to worry about it dying on you.

Charging the watch is great, too. I have the puck-shaped charger sitting on my bedside table. All I have to do at night is lay the watch onto it and let the magnets “hook” onto it. It’s infinitely simpler than plugging in my iPhone. I hope Apple brings wireless charging to its other devices soon.

Some people have complained about worsened battery life on their iPhone when using the watch. I don’t doubt there is some effect (particularly when using turn-by-turn directions), but in practice it doesn’t seem to very noticeable. I’m using the iPhone 5 and my battery life seems basically the same as ever.

**Siri**

Siri is hit-and-miss. The way you launch Siri needs to be polished a bit.

To activate her, you can either hold down on the crown or you can say “Hey Siri.” Saying “Hey Siri” doesn’t work if the watch face is turned off, so you can’t just talk spontaneously. You have to first raise your wrist to turn on the watch, then talk. Also, you have to talk quite loudly and distinctly for the action to register. I don’t really like this feature since I feel like a bit of a moron shouting into my wrist in public (or even at home).

On multiple occasions, I have launched Siri by holding down on the crown (the same way you hold down on the iPhone’s home button), only to have it turn itself off before I can speak, or else turn off midway through my question. You can avoid this by continuing to hold down on the crown until you’ve finished speaking, but I find it physically tiresome to do so.

Siri is a bit more limited on the watch than on the phone. Notably, she cannot search the web. However, she can set alarms, stopwatches, timers, reminders, text people, call people, launch apps, check Wolfram Alpha, get the weather, run basic calculations, etc. Launching apps via Siri is actually easier than going through the app screen, in most cases. When she can’t respond to a request, she’ll tell you to use handoff on your phone instead. This works well (you just slide up on the little handoff icon), but I find it defeats the purpose of owning the watch, in practice.

Note: I have managed to freeze/crash Siri several times. If she tells you she’s unable to respond to a query, and you then launch her again to ask her something else, she’ll freeze 50% of the time.

**Navigation/Interface**

People have said they find it confusing to navigate through the watch’s interface. I disagree. There’s really not much to learn (certainly no more than when learning to use a smartphone), and it quickly becomes intuitive. It’s not always very fast to navigate from one screen to another, as I mentioned above, but anyone should be able to learn to do this. I showed my watch to quite a few friends this week and none of them had any problems.

**Multilingual voice support**

I imagine this isn’t a problem for most people, but I live in a bilingual country and I speak 3 languages so it’s important to me. In short, the watch does not have multilingual support.

The iPhone sort of does. When you’re texting someone or dictating an email, you can select the keyboard language and voice recognition will automatically switch to the desired language. This is great, for instance, when I speak to my wife in one language and my brother in a different language. However, Siri only recognizes the default device language.

The watch asks you to pick one language when you set it up, and as far as I can tell there’s no way to switch languages when dictating texts to different people. Disappointing.

**Overall look and feel**

I have the 38mm silver sport with white strap. It’s light on my wrist and the strap is very comfortable. I was worried I might sweat underneath it quite a bit, but I’m pleasantly surprised to find that I don’t. People have given me a fair number of compliments on how it looks and it pairs well with most of my casual outfits. I enjoy the way it looks. No regrets here.

**Apps**

This is a real grab-bag for the moment. In practice, I have few apps installed on my watch because most of them are terrible. I can give a quick run-down of some of my use cases. Please remember that I rarely launch these because simply the act of launching an app is a bit slow and frustrating, and then the apps are often slow to load.

Weather: The stock weather app is by far the best. Apple uses a [radial dial](http://i.imgur.com/zyVf4zg.png) to show you sky conditions, temperature, and likelihood of rain. You don’t need to scroll down at all. Dark Sky is nice if you *just* want to know when and how much it’s going to rain, but it’s not amazing for anything else. Weather Underground is cluttered and amateurish.

Sports: I find myself using The Score the most often. You can define multiple favourite teams using your iPhone and the Score app will show you scores and upcoming games for all of them. The glance shows you the next soonest matchup. MLB At Bat is disappointing because it limits you to a single team. I haven’t tried ESPN yet (which I hate on the phone).

Calculator: I’m using Calcbot. The actual calculator function (add, divide, subtract) is terrible. However, it has two nice features. First, a very small tip calculator that allows you not only adjust the % of the tip but also split the bill between any number of people. Second, it has a quick unit converter (mi to km, lb. to kg., USD to EUR). It can only convert 4 things, but it’s fast and effective.

Transportation: The Transit App is straight up broken. I don’t know why, but its data never refreshes and it takes an eternity to load. Just skip it for now. I tried CityMapper but I found the interface cluttered and unclear. I don’t recommend any transportation apps for the moment.

Around Me: I’ve only used Yelp and Starbucks, but these are surprisingly good. Yelp lets you check for the closest restaurants or cafes and shows mini-capsule reviews, along with whether a place is open or not. It will show a place’s location on a maps, and you can launch directions to there directly from within the app. Starbucks has the same location finder, and it also shows you how much credit you have on your gift card(s). However, you cannot pay from within the Starbucks app—only from within passbook, which is a bit silly.

Banking: Obviously I can’t check every banking app, but in practice this is useful. All it really allows you to do is check your balance or the value of your accounts, but that’s enough to let you know if an investment went up/down, or if you received your paycheque or if a payment went through.

Twitter: I am a very casual twitter user, but it’s obvious that the default app is a wash. However, the Twitterrific app is pretty decent because it allows you to receive notifications for mentions or DMs.

Flight apps: I haven’t taken any flights so I can’t comment on these yet.

Lists: Wunderlist and Things are among the apps that provide to-do lists on your phone. I rarely use these in my daily life so I can’t comment much on them, but Things has a nice glance.

Apps I found totally useless: Amazon, Evernote, Instagram, Instapaper.",165,332,2015-04-27,AAPL,0.059054226614534855,0.9096754193305969,0.03127034241333604

AppleWatch,The bitterness and entitlement is getting ridiculous,"I, like many of you fine souls, woke up at a strange hour to order a watch. I, like many of you, love apple products and typically get them on launch by standing in line. I, like many of you, did not receive my watch on launch day and I am still processing. I check my status continually, I look for a charge, because I am excited about getting it. But I'm not raising a pitchfork and storming cupertino because my watch promised to me in mid-may hasn't shipped yet. So many ""This launch is botched"" threads or ""F@#$ Apple"" and what not. Yes, the launch hasn't been the smoothest of any of the products that I've waited to buy, but you were never promised the 24th. You were promised a range of days. Unfortunately the models that you and I bought were more popular than others, or they misjudged which would be popular. Again, that sucks, but you were never promised the 24th, but a 2 week range. Can we stop acting like we've been baited and switched? Can we stop declaring the evil things we would like to do in future launches? Write Tim Cook and tell him that you are disappointed, but they never lied to you or promised you you would have your watch. Refresh your status, and be sad that you haven't gotten bumped up like other folks. Stop assuming that the sample size of this sub shows any real concrete data that certain models ""aren't shipping at all"" when you can see pictures of people with them elsewhere.

apple,Anyone with tattoos and the watch please read.,"So I thought my shiny new 42mm SS watch had a bad wrist detector sensor. The watch would lock up every time the screen went dark and prompted me for my password. I wouldn't receive notifications. I couldn't figure out why especially since the watch was definitely not losing contact with my skin. also I couldn't find anything online with people experiencing this issue. I was about to give up and call Apple tomorrow when I decided to try holding it against my hand (my left arm is sleeved and where I wear my watch is tattooed as well) and it worked. My hand isn't tattooed and the Watch stayed unlocked. Once I put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink the watch would automatically lock again. Just wanted to give anyone a heads up about this issue because I don't see it mentioned anywhere in Apple's support documents.

EDIT: upon further testing it seems like notifications in general won't come through unless it senses it's on your skin. So when my friend texts me and the watch is on my wrist my phone shows an incoming text...when I move the watch to the top of my hand which is not tattooed the watch gets notifications. 

EDIT 2: by turning off wrist detection messages are being pushed to the watch now. I believe this will hinder apple pay though because I can't use the password (because the watch can't detect my wrist), but at least it's working now.

EDIT 3: here are a couple of pics of the tattoo [Pic1](http://i.imgur.com/9ifIbWv.jpg) [Pic2](http://i.imgur.com/49YgoYf.jpg)

iphone,"iPhone stolen 3 weeks ago, no luck on iCloud until tonight... and it's in Tijuana.","Already canceled service, switched providers, changed passwords on email accounts and apps, but still wondering if there's any way to kill the phone remotely. It's an iPhone 5 32GB. I found the Device ID on the carrier's website (didn't have the box, it was a hand me down).

I had no 4 digit pin so it was easier for whoever stole it to mess with whatever personal info was on it. I didn't realize it was stolen until 12 hours after the fact, but rushed to change passwords immediately the next day, called my provider &amp; reported it, plus suspended service on it.

It was stolen in Oregon, and it's in Mexico now. Am I safe to assume that the thief was more interested in the device than in my info? I haven't seen any irregularities in my bank account (had a banking app on there), or any weird login attempts on the email accts I had synced. 

Apple's forums talk about contacting law enforcement, but who do you call exactly? It's not exactly something you call your local PD for, is it?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

apple,Something I found funny about the recent Apple Watch posts on /r/technology,"Let me begin this by apologizing if this post is breaking any of the subs rules, I don't usually post here but I wanted to share how ridiculous this is with somebody. 

I was deciding on whether or not I should looking into getting an Apple Watch so I decided to check /r/technology for an unbiased view of the technology. I typed in ""Apple Watch"" to the search bar and set it to show the newest posts first. I found [this](http://imgur.com/a/ct78m), every single post praising or even showing the Apple Watch in a positive light was downvoted. The only post out of the 15 most recent posts (which date back to 4 days ago) with more than 10 upvotes is a post titled ""Company breaks open Apple Watch to discover what it says is 'planned obsolescence'"". Look, I don't know what I expected from /r/technology they have consistently bashed Apple products since the sub was created. They should at least give the watch a fair shot right? I don't know I just thought this was annoying.

apple,My dog ate my apple watch,"I put my apple watch on it's charger, on my bed near my pillow, so that I can put it on when I wake up.  Then I settled in for some netflix before falling asleep. A short while later, my car keys started ringing from my Tile app, which led me to find my 8 month old puppy had snuck my watch off the charger and went to town on the band and somehow touch activated the Tile app on the watch.  She only chewed on the band fortunately, the watch itself was unharmed, I was lucky she activated the Tile app before she could do more damage.    

Band replacement due to [sneaky teething puppy chew attacks](http://imgur.com/a/utlv0) are not covered by warranty.  I already asked apple support (was worth a shot).
