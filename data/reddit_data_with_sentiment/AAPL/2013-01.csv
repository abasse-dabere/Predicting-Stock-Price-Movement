mac,Anyone recommend and app for keeping the books for a business..?,"Hey Guys,

Looking for an app that will allow me and a colleague to sign into an app and be able to access and update the books for our business on both the iphone and Mac OS X.

Can anyone recommend anything like this.?

We were looking at using something like google docs but i think an app would be a lot more efficient.

mac,Should I get this refurbished Mini?,"http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/mac_mini

So, I've been wanting to get a Mac Mini for a couple months now.  I've had a Dell laptop since June 2010, buts its been running slow lately and is in need of investments to keep it up (restore it and new battery for starters).  I'm in college, so I'd like to keep my first Mac a little cheap, so that's what brought me to the Mini.

I'm not a heavy power user by any means; I use it to stream video, do homework and browse the Internet.  As such, I don't have a lot of needs, but was certainly looking to future-proof my Mini for as long as possible.  I've been playing around with my options, but I've settled on the $799 model with 8 GB RAM and the Fusion Drive, which puts my total over $1050.

My question is, would I be fine with the $679 refurbished model?  I mean, I'm not the most tech savvy, but I could probably figure out how to upgrade the RAM.  But I really do want that Fusion Drive.  Should I just suck it up and go without it though?",18.0,7,2013-01-01,AAPL,0.041922468692064285,0.9081834554672241,0.04989409074187279

iphone,I have spent the past 8 months developing an app. It's a self updating contact list. Would you use this?,"I am only posting this because I've put in a tonne of work and also saw someone post something of a similar nature about a youtube type video/music player a few weeks ago....

TL;DR - It's a way to have your contact list automatically update when a friend gets a new number/email/etc... without you touching anything. You don't even need to be told they have a new number or anything. Your contact list does all the work. Totally seamless. So when you hit ""call"" or ""message"" on a contact it will automatically use there newest number.

I am not monetizing it or charging for it. I just want it to be used by people as it's time saving.

I've spent nights building this app and I would love feedback of some sort, positive or negative is both appreciated. I think it could save so much time if this gets traction. It can remove a lot of hassle.

Basically, let's say I get a new phone number... and a new phone... I can just sync my phone to get everyones numbers, BUT that doesn't mean everyone gets my new number. I have to spam it out willy nilly. What this does, is gets rid of that. It will automatically update in my friends contact list without them having to touch/update/find out my new number. It also works with emails and other details that you fill into your ""card""

Currently, I have both my computer, iPhone and iPad synching contacts, contacts and email with GMail but I was thinking of switching everything to iCloud.

* Google disabling ActiveSync connection for GMail. I don't really care for the GMail iOS app, so I would prefer using this in the standard mail app.

apple,Hackers Already Have Untethered iOS 6.0.2 Jailbreak For iPhone 5.,"If you have been eagerly waiting for a jailbreak despite the doom and gloom about jailbreaking off late, then we’ve some great news.

planetbeing – member of the iPhone Dev team has revealed on reddit that he has an untethered iOS 6.0.2 jailbreak running on iPhone 5.

While responding to a discussion thread about pod2g returning to jailbreak development, planetbeing had this to say:

Yeah, I’m not really sure what all the doom and gloom is about. The fact is, I have an untethered iOS 6.0.2 JB running on my iPhone 5 right now. The reasons it’s not released are because 1. releasing it would burn an exploit we want to save for ourselves so we can always get in to look at new firmware and help JB in the future, 2. iOS 6.1 is coming very soon and will likely break a small part of it anyway, there’s no point in sacrificing the many bugs it won’t break.

Anyway, where there are 4+ bugs (that it took to get this to work), there’s gotta be one or two more so while jailbreaking is getting harder, reports of its death are highly exaggerated.

This is not stuff I want to say over Twitter with 140 characters because I’m afraid of starting some sort of riot, but I like the smaller /r/jailbreak community more. ;)

planetbeing has also clarified that it is a fully working jailbreak, which allows you to run MobileSubstrate, which is required for jailbreak tweaks. The other good news is that pod2g seems to have returned to jailbreak development after submitting his app to Apple for approval.

He (pod2g) didn’t (say he has returned to jailbreak development), but hey, at least he told me last night he looked into a couple of bugs (without much success) recently, after basically not being around since WWJC, so that’s cool. I doubt he wants to promise he’ll be around working on this full time however. I haven’t worked on any jailbreak stuff for a couple of months as well, not until basically I was flying back from 29C3 in Germany and realized/remembered I actually know about enough bugs to put together an entire untethered jailbreak (still unreleasable due to reasons I stated in my other comment here).

Jay Freeman aka saurik who is the founder of Cydia also confirmed it:

I actually was working with pod2g (albeit with a worse headache than I’ve had in at least a year, so mostly as a “gdb test monkey”), and can thereby personally attest that he didn’t just say it, he actually did it ;P.

ipad,Additional network login screen: is there any method or app to trigger it reliably?,"I like to use my iPad at school, but the wifi network requires me to log-in with my school network ID and password. When I'm using my laptop, this is never a problem.

However, when I'm using my iPad, the network login screen sometimes pops up, other times it doesn't. I've tried triggering it in safari and using other browsers/apps, and also by switching off wifi, forgetting the network in settings, etc but sometimes it just doesn't want to give me the prompt to log in. Other times it pops up and I log in, no problem.

Is there any tried and true method to make the network login screen available that I might be missing? Any app that can trigger it reliably for me?

apple,Is my Macbook pro about to die? (2010; core 2 duo),"Okay I am getting weird display problems with my macbook pro the last couple of days. It started with flash player not working properly. Videos play just fine until you try and go full screen. When you try and go full screen it usually will be frozen on the image that it was when full screen was clicked, or it will be just a black screen. Audio still works fine. Netflix usually is just a black screen with audio. The only way I can temporarily fix this problem is to constantly reinstall flash player, and that usually only works for one or two videos. So I am constantly having to reinstall flash player. Now tonight I've had some other problems come up. First the screen randomly went to a light blue screen (the same one in startup) and froze there. After resetting I continued on. Now just a few minutes ago I was surfing the web and the screen glitched out again. This one is a little tough to explain. The first part looked kind of like tracking on old vhs tapes with a flickering screen and then the screen went really pixelated, then went black. Now after resetting a second time tonight, the computer appears to be running very slowly when trying to open things or just process information. Also it appears to glitch out on certain things (for example in Safari when clicking on history it comes up a jumbled mess and it takes it a moment to put things in the right place.
I've had the flash player problem before and I believe it was right before my hard drive died, but disk utility says everything is fine.

I ran the extended hardware test and it showed no issues. But today when I went to wake my computer up from sleep, it wouldn't. You could hear the hard drive fire up like normal but the display/apple logo stayed black. When I tried to hold down the power to force the computer off, it didn't have the normal ""click"" and off, it only sounded like the hard drive was slowly spinning less and less. When I hit the power for it to come back on, I was taken to what looked like the screen that comes up when your battery dies and you plug it up. That whitish screen with the little notches progress bar at the bottom. I have a genius bar appointment scheduled but I don't want to go if all they are going to do is run the hardware test and say tough luck. Also I don't know if this is an issue or not but when I close my computer and it goes to sleep a lot of the time the apple logo will come back on for a little bit before turning off for good.So anybody have any ideas?

ipad,Suggestions for ways to secure iPad for School Use?,"Hello r/ipad. I'm new to this subreddit so I'm sorry if I'm not in the right place for this. I work for a local school that is planning on deploying iPads for the students in the science classes to use for in class activities.

As of right now we only have 30 iPads and a [Bretford-made iPad cart](http://apple.bretford.com/products/powersynccartforipad/) for secure lockups and charging/syncing. I've been using the Apple Configurator tool to setup my ipads but I've noticed there aren't any real ways to lock down the ipads so that they can't be messed with by students (changing wallpapers, erasing wifi passwords, changing w/e they can in the settings) which worries me. I know that I can restrict the ability to add/remove apps but aside from that I don't know of any way to lock things down.

Another issue is that I've noticed that even if an iPad is managed by my computer's Apple Configurator, it can be easily taken over by another computer's Apple Configurator. There's nothing stopping a student from resetting all of our settings if they know this fact.

Any suggestions for apps, tricks, or settings that you can think of to help us really lock down our iPads at school would be appreciated.",5.0,6,2013-01-11,AAPL,0.04402058944106102,0.9240677952766418,0.03191158547997475

mac,Old Macbook is slowing down. What are some simple things I can do to help speed it up?,"I'm driving a 2008 Macbook 2.4 ghz Intel Core 2 Duo with a 160GB hard drive. It's officially orphaned since I cannot install Mountain Lion on it (tear) but I'm currently between jobs, so upgrading my computer is on hold. 

The thing is that it's starting to huff and puff quite a bit on otherwise simple tasks. Watching Netflix in Chrome is just too much for this computer to handle (the video and audio get out of synch, the fan turns on high speed and the computer gets warm) so I use Safari and it works alright. Even the latest versions of iTunes are taxing to my system, often causing noticeable delays between clicks and action on the screen. I don't want to admit that this may be because programs are being designed for newer, more powerful systems and my old friend just can't handle them as well. 

I will admit that I haven't done much as far as preventative maintenance goes. Mostly because I use this computer for personal use (emails and reddit, mostly. Oh, and Netflix). At the suggestion of my father, I cleaned out the system cache files using Cache Out X and it helped some.

ipad,"I need ipad game suggestions to feed my new obsession. It all started with ""The Room""...","You guys. Have you played ""The Room""? CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGY IS THESE DAYS? That shit was not only the most beautiful thing I'd ever experienced on my iPad ever in my life, but it was the most engaging puzzler of a game I've ever come across ever. I actually don't think I put the damn iPad down once from the start until I finished the whole thing. I was just in awe the whole time and couldn't stop. It was perfect. I realize I probably I sound like an ad right now, and I don't even care. I'm not even going to apologize because it is just that good. If you haven't yet experienced the magic of The Room, stop what you're doing immediately and download that shit. I don't care if you're in the middle of doing surgery or finding the cure for cancer – all of that can wait. So DO IT. NOW. 


  Anyway, a sad post-effect of delving into the magical realm of The Room is that now all the games I've played since are depressingly sub-par. I want other mesmerizing mystery puzzler adventures, and the only satisfactory above-average games I've found since The Room have been from the Drawn series. So I come to you, oh ipad connoisseurs, in hopes you might have some recommendations of games along the Drawn/The Room-type puzzle games. 


   The only criteria I have is that I despise games disguised and advertised as adventure point-and-click puzzlers that seem like the kind of game I want, only to end up being mostly a bunch of hidden-object levels with a storyline only the objects mostly have nothing to do with the story or tasks at hand, and mostly just act as plugs to make the game seem longer. I don't play that game. Waste of my time. But there are so so many of these hidden-object decoys out there..

The biggest problem was the damn fan noise when there was really no load on the machine.  Are you kidding me?  This supposed example of a great Windows 8 machine was CRAP.

So, I broke down and bought the MacBook Air and an Apple TV.  (my wife has an iPad 3) Wow!  Happiness.  Who needs touch screen when you have this awesome touchpad?  No fingerprints all over the screen.  Whisper quiet fan.  You have to stick your ear against the machine to hear it.  If only the MacBook could run some iPad apps...",13.0,9,2013-01-15,AAPL,0.12375915795564651,0.8402876853942871,0.035953182727098465

mac,My experience with Apple's Customer Service,"This past August my mid 2007 20-inch iMac with the 2.4 GHz processor, the ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO graphics card, and the 320 GB drive would not boot up. It would not recognize the hard drive. So I took it into my local Apple store to have it repaired, and they told me it would be $160.00 to replace the hard drive with a new 500 GB drive. I thought this was a smoking good deal, since I've had this iMac since the summer of 2007, and it still ran fine.Well, except for the broken drive. A few days went by, and they called and told me that the repair tech accidentally damaged the control-board (motherboard) and they ordered a new one. I was not upset, because not only was I getting a larger hard drive for $160.00, but it also looked I would be getting a new board. Not a bad price to keep a 5 year old machine running. Well a week goes by, and I get another call from the Apple store. This time they tell me that the new board was defective, and they would be unable to repair my iMac. At first I was a little devastated, but the gentleman Apple employee told me to give him an hour and he'll have my brand new iMac ready. I showed up at the store an hour later, and he handed me a brand new 21.5-inch, mid 2011. It was with the 2.7 GHz Core i5 chip, AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 MB, and 1 TB hard drive. So instead of spending $160.00 for a new hard drive, I spent $185.00 for a new Apple Care. I don't know of another company that would replace a 5 year old product with a brand new one. Simply amazing.

I have looked at Apple's certification site and it doesn't appear to have been upgraded since Lion. Is this the case? Also not sure which of the certifications to investigate. I would want to look at support in a corporate environment using server os too.

How about yours?",71.0,9,2013-01-21,AAPL,0.01738196238875389,0.9031240344047546,0.07949401438236237
iphone,Before upgrading to iOS6 make sure you know your restriction code - it will save you alot of trouble.,"I must of spend hours yesterday getting through this issue.  I had a iphone4 running iOS6 (upgraded in december ) and I just got an iphone5.  I used the restore from backup feature on my iphone5 so all my texts and prefemces would copy over to the new phone.  


I wanted to clear out my iphone4 data for reselling it, so I went to the reset data and settings option menu.  When I tried to reset it presented me with a passcode challenge.  I had no idea what the passcode was or when I even set it up.  It wasn't that big of a deal for the iphone4 cause even without the passcode I was able to reset the iphone4 using itunes to factory defaults.  I checked on my iphone5 and it too had a passcode - which I assume came from the transfer of settings from the iphone4.  Through experimentation it seemed that I could  not get rid of the restriction password on my iphone5 without resetting the phone and losing all my data.


Through some google searches I was able to find a tool that could extract data from itunes backups  I found this http://www.iphonebackupextractor.com/  utility.  With that utility I was able to point to my itunes backups and extract the plist files where they stored all the preference data on the phone.  

For ios5 backup you can extract the password by using the above utility to extract the file ""Library/Preferences/com.apple.springboard.plist"".  Then you can use a plist viewer app to read that file and extract the field.  You should end up with something like this in the file.
    
        &lt;key&gt;SBParentalControlsPIN&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;9515&lt;/string&gt;

The problem is that with iOS6 this field is not there and they moved it to somewhere else in the backup file and encrypted it.  


I was all set to start reseting my iphone and making various backups with different pin numbers to see if I could tell where the encrypted code was in the backup image was and try to bruteforce the password.  That would of probably taken me weeks and I am probably too dumb and lazy to have made any progress.  Luckly I remembered I had an old harddrive that I wasn't using since I had got an SSD early last year.  I looked through the old harddrive and was able to find an old ios5 backup.  I was then able to use the above procedure and get the restriction pin.  

TL;DR:  It s easy to hack your restriction code on iOS5;  iOS6 not so much",2.0,9,2013-01-21,AAPL,0.07565642148256302,0.8929553031921387,0.03138822317123413

mac,Helping my Mom graduate from Sims on iPad to the real deal - Sims 3 on a Mac,"So my Mom found the Sims Freeplay on her iPad and absolutely loves it. Unforunately the lack of depth is showing up as she has reached the higher levels and run out of houses to purchase. She comes home from work and sitting in front of a PC at a computer desk is not an option.

I am wondering if an apple based laptop with Sim 3 could be the solution. I say apple because they tend to be lighter and more user friendly. Here's what I am wondering..

What kind of apple laptop would play Sims 3 comfortably with good battery life ? Is playing with the touchpad doable or would she need a mouse? Are there any good laptop/couch setups, like a lap desk or something similar so she could be comfortable on the couch and still be able to play on the laptop?

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated, I really want her to get to enjoy the real deal and Sims 3 looks perfect for her. Unfortunately playing at a desk is just out of the question, so I am hoping yall can help out

P.S. I originally posted this to r/thesims but it was suggested I post here. I am curious about the Macbook Air vs the Pro and if Sims 3 will run on the Air. Are there any places to get  good deals on these laptops or even to enter to win one?

It offers the easiest way possible in iOS to collect your favorite messages and the prettiest way to view them. 

Imagine all your texts, FB msgs, etc. were lost. That would suck, because there are a lot of nice memories in there. But how often do you browse old text msgs? Probably never, because the cool ones are lost in the clutter. Tinbox is a place for those cool IM’s - Instant Memories if you will. 

Please check out our [website](http://www.tinboxapp.com) for more info and find it [here](http://itun.es/i6J79ZW) on the App Store.

I've looked through threads and found lots of disagreement about what app to use, and some dissenting users say that performance and battery life is better if you just convert the file.

apple,iPad mini case recommendations?,"After a close call dropping my black iPad mini onto the kitchen floor (luckily it only got a tiny scratch...nothing that black nail polish wouldn't fix!), I'm in the market for a case to avoid future disaster.

I currently have an apple smart cover for it, but considering I learned first-hand the importance of protecting the rear which apple's cover won't do, can anyone make a good recommendation on a case? 

It needs to cover the sides and the back. Covering the front is purely optional, especially if the case front is raised which will give the front glass the protection it needs. Also, no hard shells if possible

I was a big fan of the smart cover aesthetic, so no garish cases please. Not a fan of leather, buttons, zippers, etc. If there were an case that existed for the mini like the smart case for the larger ipad , that would be ideal. the only one I found was the cygnett enigma which had a less than favorable review on youtube (anyone here try that case out?)

What cases are you using to protect your minis?

Edit #1 - thanks for all the feedback everyone. Keep them coming!

Edit #2 - decided on the switcheasy case since it would leverage the dark gray Smart Cover I already own, as well as match he covers color and aesthetic.

I know everyone swears by otterbox, but it's just not for me. I feel too much aesthetics are compromised for the sake of durability but again, that's just a personal preference.

iphone,Can we nail Sprint to the wall over unlocking yet?,"Hey /r/iPhone,

With the recent hubbub over the legality of unlocking (and that we're seemingly going through the carriers for our unlocks now), I wanted to take a moment and point out that while this is sufficient for AT&amp;T and Verizon users (and in the case of the latter, their phones are already unlocked out of the box), Sprint users get left out in the cold. Sprint will either flat-out refuse to unlock our iPhones, or if they do, it's a sort of half-assed unlock that only allows us to use our devices outside the US. If we want to switch to Straight Talk, or something like that...we're out of luck.

Personally, I am okay with Sprint's service, but I have been spending a lot of time in an area where their network is so bad that my iPhone won't even hold on to a 3G signal, and I would appreciate being able to use the extra line on my girlfriend's T-Mobile account so that I may have a phone that *functions* while I'm visiting her. As it stands now, I can either switch (nope) or I'm stuck on Sprint with no way out.

tl;dr: In light of unlocking being ""illegal"", I think Sprint shouldn't be allowed to withhold a full unlock even after the contract has lapsed. What say you?",9.0,6,2013-01-27,AAPL,0.02234150841832161,0.9260637760162354,0.051594700664281845
