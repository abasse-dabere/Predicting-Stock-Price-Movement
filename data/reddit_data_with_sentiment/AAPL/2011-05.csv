ipad,Any suggestions for locking down iPads for public use?,"I just got about a dozen of these things dumped on me.  They're the newest model.  These would be used for in-building checkout in public libraries in a major US city.  I can restrict purchases, the deletion of apps and content but I can't seem to find a way to prevent the settings (network, etc.) from being changed.   

So far, all I've come up with is to have the librarians use the ""reset all settings"" and redo the restrictions and network, and have them completely restore through iTunes if things get real ugly.  I don't like this because many librarians are as retarded as the patrons and I don't have the staff to support these stupid things every time someone changes the wifi settings.

apple,What things about OS X annoy you the most?,"There are a lot of comments about all the good things about OS X on /r/apple, so I thought the opposite could be interesting. Also people may have solutions to the annoyances :)

Anyway, mine are:

1. Click to focus. In ubuntu for example if you have a terminal and firefox open and the terminal window has the focus, you can click a link in the firefox window and it will immediately open the link. In OS X, you have to click the window once, then click the link to open. This also happens when selecting text.

2.  A single menu bar at the top. With dual monitors, it is painful when you have a window on the monitor without the menubar, and need to use a menu item - a lot of mouse movement is required. Also, it takes way too much mouse work to select a menu item in an application that isn't active.

3. No common method to uninstall stuff. In windows you go to add/remove programs. In ubuntu, you use the package manager. In OS X, you either drag the application to trash (most apps), run the installer again and select uninstall (eg virtualbox), or delete a panel in system preferences (eg HyperDock). 

4. No dedicated OS modifier key. In windows and ubuntu, the windows key is used for basically no application level shortcuts. There is no similar key that is ""free"" for OS X, meaning deciding on global shortcuts is a lot harder.",179,26,2011-05-09,AAPL,0.029823878780007362,0.9395427703857422,0.030633311718702316

apple,"Long time Windows user, thinking about making the change to Apple, I want some honest feedback","I did a quick search and didn't see anything completely relevant.

Bit of background. I have used Windows since 95 (skipped vista/ME tho) and know of its quirks, I know how to use it so I am not worried. I have some background in programming (C/C++/C#/VBA) though I do not do this for a living. I use Ubuntu on a laptop right now (six years old, cracked, going strong) and have no issues with terminal commands/navigations.
I have recently started a Master's degree where most of the other people in my group use Mac. This means there are a lot of available licenses for me out there, a lot of available support for existing programs etc. I can do everything needed on my PC and in fact I can do many things better (do not read ""faster"" or ""easier"" but ""better""). I have been thinking of a new laptop recently and now I am starting to consider a Mac for the first time. 
With my degree I will be using programs such as:
Reference manager (ie Papers on the Mac, I currently use JabRef on my Win/Unbuntu systems and I know this program is usable on Mac)
LaTeX (I use TexnicCenter right now on Windows, Gummi for Ubuntu)
MatLab
TomLab/GAMS and a menagerie of other programs.

If I get a Mac I am looking at getting a MBP in either 13/15 for portability and some power (for simulations and such)

So my questions:
1) What are the top 5 advantages that you have found for Macs above other systems (Please try to target towards an academic/technical field)
2) What are the top 5 disadvantages that you have found for Macs above other systems (Again, please target towards an academic/technical field, but these can be even the smallest things that make you absolutely angry enough to throw your apple out the window)
3) Optional: What are your thoughts and suggestions on build features/screen size etc. This would be nice if you have used it for a few years and regretted not making the jump to more ram etc. Even better if you have run simulations/produced latex on it.
4) One of my major problems is price. I priced out equivalent systems for PC and Mac and the PC always comes in cheaper. Most extreme was the fully upgraded 15 MBP, 1000$ difference for equivalent hardware (software was limited to OS only on both). Is it honestly worth the premium if things will be slightly easier and I can do everything needed on a PC?

please: do not reply with windows bashing (such as advantage: you don't get the blue screen) or mac praise (such as advantage: its a mac or it doesn't crash), I want actual feedback on an objective basis.

I am going to an Apple store to do some more research (not buying, just looking around to figure out sizes and if I can actually deal with the OS), so I will reply tonight, thanks in advance.

TL:DR -&gt; Top 5 (serious) advantages/disadvantages for Mac without bashing Windows or Uber-Praising Mac.

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, I appreciate the answers and each one eased a few concerns and gave me some things to look for. From what I have read, the aggregate response is:
Advantages: 1)The transition will not be that hard, 2)the customer support is great, 3)there are ways to run programs from any system (Parallels/VMWare/DualBoot etc) and they run seamlessly, 4)The little things like Expose make up for the lack of 'tinkering', 5)The software doesn't cost an arm and a lag
Disadvantages: 1) Some things just don't work, 2)Gaming, 3)Price (but its worth it because they hold their value), 4) Heat on the MBP 5) Dual booting/VM is a pain some times

While at the Apple store I understood a lot more of the feel and ease of some of the Mac features. I also talked to one of the geniuses and told him 200$ (can) for 4GB or ram is ridiculous. He agreed and told me that as long as I keep the original ram for when I need services, I should pick up ram at my local store and use that... which surprisingly put me at ease more than anything else he said. I think I am going to go back and pick up a 15 MBP with the 2.0GHz i7 and spend the little extra money for a hi-def screen.
Thanks again for all of the replies.

EDIT2: There have been way more replies than I expected, thanks again. I am going to stop replying to everyone, but I am still reading them all and noting the things to watch out for and things to try. I am actually blown away at the depth some of the replies have gone...

I'm a big fan on the Windows-style Cmd-Tab that makes the next program active.  I.e. I can cycle through open applications and choose one.  However, in OSX the application's window doesn't appear if minimized, which causes me to have to use the mouse.  Is there an easy way around this?

I want to surprise her with an iPad and I want to load it up with stuff before I give it to her.  I'm looking for suggestions for games and other apps that a 61 year old woman might enjoy.

I'm not sure if the hospital will have internet access and I can only afford the wi-fi version so anything I get for it will have to be able to operate without internet.  I'm just looking for any ideas that might help out with the boredom and take her mind off things.  She has a basic understanding of computers that falls somewhere between being able to check email and being able to use facebook.

Much thanks.

Edit::  Thank you all for the ideas!  It's very nice of you to help me out.

apple,"Apple Developers lose Activation code, tell me to buy another one.","A few days ago I purchased the iOS development package and paid my $99 tax to join the ranks of iOS developers. 24 hours later all I had was an invoice. I got on the phone and started talking to the Apple developer tech support guys and eventually got a non-activation code activation code.

[I posted about it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/hen3x/signed_up_for_an_ios_dev_package_24_hours_later/)

3 days later I'm calling a few times a day to get things moving but apparently it's some sort of glitch in the matrix because no one can tell me why I was never sent a real activation code. All they can tell me is that ""*This never happens and have no idea what's going on*""

Last straw, today I call and am told that the quickest way to solve this would be to buy another iOS development package.... Really Apple?... Really?

It's an auto generated fucking code, how hard can it be for someone to generate one and send it too me!?! I didn't have a lot of faith in Apple to begin with but this is too much, telling me to buy another fucking $99 iOS development package is unacceptable.


Sorry I needed to rant about this.



**Update:** I just got off the phone with another tech. I asked for an update even though I knew they couldn't give me one and I actually got an update (*Last guy said they couldn't tell me anything since it was a different department*) This lady said that she just got a notice that this is a new issue and that it's affected more than one developer and is being worked on.

iphone,iPhone Vs. Android from a power users perspective,"I thought I would post about my experience about the iPhone vs Android debate that comes up all the time.  To give you a little back story, I owned an iPhone 3G then moved on to the Google Nexus One.  When I got my Nexus, I purchased it for the full $529.99 with the thought that I would not be forced to be on contract from that point on.  I would just sell the phone each year and purchase a new one for what would probably amount to the upgrade price.  Well, to make a long story short, I am now the proud owner of a new business and I needed the ability to take credit cards in homes.  When I started looking around at my options, I was amazed to find that the credit card apps that were available on iPhone were also available on Android.  This was great until I actually started trying to use them.  A lot of the features that they would advertise were not available on Android, just iPhone.  Now I was presented with a dilemma, do I go back to the iPhone or try and make this work for me?

I eventually decided that from a business perspective, it would look more professional to just go back to the iPhone and use the solutions that were available there.  I have always been a big fan of open source projects and with android it was the best of both worlds.  This is my view of both of the operating systems, their strengths and their weaknesses.  To be clear, I owned an iPhone 3G on AT&amp;T, moved to the Nexus One on T-Mobile, then moved from there to the iPhone 4 on AT&amp;T.  I am a power user when it comes to phones.  The Nexus One was rooted and had Cyanogenmod on it.  The current iPhone that I have now is not jailbroken, nor do I plan to since I am accepting credit cards on it.

**Screen**: I have to say, the iPhone has one of the most beautiful screens that I have seen.  I have astigmatism, but I do have glasses to compensate.  I don’t care how close I am to the screen, I can’t see any pixilation. The Nexus One has an AMOLED screen and it looks really nice, but not quite the “crispness” of the iPhone.  This is not a negative against android since any manufacturer could implement the same screen. I am sure there is one out there right now, but I have not looked for it.  The Nexus had some issues with the touch sensors, but that was a hardware defect.  I have since messed around with several other Android devices where the screen was a joy to use.

**Speed**: Coming from the Nexus one, the iPhone was quite a bit quicker overall.  I like the fact that the screen was so smooth when you are flipping from one screen to another. Again, this is nothing unique to the iPhone since there are several Android models that are just as fast as or faster than the iPhone.  I do realize that we don’t know the clock speed of the iPhone and that it is probably under clocked.  I would assume that it is reasonable to guess that newer Android phones have better processors and that we will probably see an upgrade with the iPhone 4S (or whatever the next model will be).

**Network**: I hate AT&amp;T. I work in a building with a lot of lead in it, but I was able to get calls most of the time with T-Mobile.  Not with AT&amp;T, I use Google voice and I just forward all of my calls to my desk phone to make sure that I people can get in touch with me.  I hope the rumors are true that sprint will be getting the iPhone.  I will switch day one when/if it happens.  I live in Dallas for anyone interested.  Also, to be fair, I can get a network connection when I go out to Forney, but I could not when I was on T-Mobile.  I will be very biased in this section since I hate AT&amp;T so much, so I will not elaborate.

**iOS VS Android**:  So, now to the good stuff.  What do I think about the whole iOS vs Android.  Both have their strengths and weaknesses.  A few of the things that convinced me to move to Android in the first place have been fixed since.  One of the big improvements on iOS is the multitasking.  I think Android does it better, but we at least have the ability to use Pandora and read reddit at the same time now.  That was not possible when I last used iOS.  Some other things are facetime, performance, hotspot (don’t like that I have to pay for it), folders, and some other small things.  To touch a bit on folders, I am SOOO happy that they implemented that.  I have 3 ½ folders dedicated to just games.  This used to take up several screens.  Now it takes up just 4 spots on one screen.  There is an application on Android called SIMI Folder.  This was a great application that added a widget to android that mimicked this functionality.  

I would also like to touch on the issue of home screens and widgets.  I LOVE that with android, you can replace the whole “launcher”.  Meaning, if I do not like the way I launch applications from the home screen, I have a choice on what I want to use.  I also like that if I want to have a clock on the home screen, it is simple to add one.  I can only hope that with iOS 5 that they will add the ability to have widgets.   There are two launcher applications on Android that I can’t recommend enough.  That would be LauncherPro and ADW Launcher.  I used LauncherPro and it was just the perfect launcher for me with its customizations and widgits that were included.

Probably the most powerful reason to using android is having the ability on certain phones to replace the whole OS with what fits you.  I have used stock (what shipped with Android), MIUI, and Cyanogenmod.  I personally loved Cyanogen the most, but the beautiful thing is that there’s a choice.  If I don’t like the way that it functions, there is a good chance that someone else out there felt the same way and implemented the ability to change it or added an option somewhere.  With iPhone, you are stuck with what Apple says you will like.  Most of the time Apple gets it right, but there are times that I want it to be a little more customized to me.

**Syncing**: We all hate iTunes on windows.  I hate the fact that I have to plug in my phone to put music on it.  With android, I was using the winamp music player.  If I wanted to have a new album that I downloaded, I would just open winamp on my computer and right click and send it to my phone.  Within a minute I had my music.  I was also an avid user of Amazon MP3. With that it was as simple as clicking purchase and I had the music on my phone and my computer.  I hope with the iTunes cloud it is just as simple (or even better in an Apple kind of way).  I also hate the fact that whenever I plugged my phone in, it would backup for f****** ever.

**Upgrading**: What can I say, I hope the rumors are true about over the air updates.  This is something that I can’t believe Apple has not implemented yet.  I don’t get why I have to plug the iPhone into the computer and download a 500+ MB file.  With android, it would just pop up and say “There is an update available” and you could just update right then and there.  Also, you could use an app called Clockwork to download several different Android OS’s if you were rooted.  This was as simple as selecting what you wanted and it would download, buckup your system, and install.  With iPhone, I have to plug it in to my computer, launch iTunes, wait for the M***** F***** to backup and copy the file to the device, verify that it is not corrupted, run an update while rebooting 2-3 times.  I hate the upgrading system on iPhone and I hope they improve it.

**Apps**:  This is where the real question for me came in when I switched from iPhone to Android then back again.  What can I do with the apps that are provided to me?  On Android, I could do almost everything that I could do on iPhone, but it seems that the iPhone gets more attention, and the updates seem to roll out faster there (in the sense of features).  This is the main reason that switched back.  I needed some of the features that were being provided in the credit card application that I chose.  I do have to say that Square had it right and almost all of the features that were on iPhone were also on Android.  Even then, it was missing the ability to add taxes onto purchases which the iPhone did have.  If you are looking for a simple CC application Square would be a good choice, but it was not right for me.

When I first moved to Android 18 months ago there were almost no big names in the market.  That has changed over the last year.  There is an equivalent to almost everything that is offered on iPhone and it is usually free.  I will list out the apps if anyone wants to know what I am/was using or if there are equivalents out there.
So in conclusion, is there a better one to pick over the other? I don’t think so.  Both platforms have their advantages and disadvantages.  The sooner that sprint, or T-Mobile gets the iPhone the better.  Would I switch back to Android if it were not for the specific need that I have.  I think the iPhone has a great OS, I just wish it were a bit more open and could do some of the things Android could do.  I also wish Android would take some notes from iOS and implement some of the eye candy along with getting more developers on board.

If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

iphone,Is there a way to sync Playlists created on the iPhone with iTunes?,"Whenever I sync it just erases the playlists I created on the phone. I know you can create them on iTunes and sync TO the phone but that's not what I want. It seems idiotic to have a feature to create them on the device if they just get erased whenever you sync. I'm running unjailbroken 4.3.2 and have one less than the latest version of iTunes. 

**Edit:** Stitchopoulis pointed me in the right direction.  The problem I was having despite Stich's advice was due to the fact that I had ""Prevent automatic sync"" selected on another menu.  Once I disabled this and matched Stich's settings and reconnected all the playlists that I had created on the device that disappeared when synced previously inexplicably reappeared (despite the fact that up until that point they weren't in itunes or on the device).

apple,"13"" Macbook Pro, 13"" Macbook Air or iPad2 - input needed","Hello good people of the Apple subreddit!

I find myself in the possesion of some extra cash, which I'd very much like spending on expanding my evergrowing collection of gadgets and hardware. Currently I have my iPhone and my gaming PC(sold my iMac because I wanted a computer with a little more umph). I will be using either the Pro, Air or iPad for browsing, YouTube, the occasional game(nothing hardware heavy) and maybe a movie on-the-go.

Here's the thoughts I have on each of the products;

Macbook Pro 13-inch: A lot more power and bang for the buck compared to the less powerfull Air, easier to DIY upgrade(thinking about going SSD and maybe a couple of more RAM), nicer looking screen than the Air. Lastly, the Pro is cheaper than the cheapest 13-inch Air.

Air: The weight and portability. Sleek design. I've heard rumors about a new one soon. Is this true?

iPad 2: Probably the prime definition of a portable device. Great battery, instant on/off capabilities. A lot cheaper than any of the two above. 

What do you think?

TL;DR: Which one should I buy - iPad2, 13"" Macbook Air or 13"" Macbook Pro. I mostly read news, twitter, facebook, Youtube, uStream etc.",76,40,2011-05-26,AAPL,0.02199784852564335,0.9352710843086243,0.04273109510540962

apple,Another great Apple Support story.,"A week ago I noticed a small thin wire coming out of the screen-facing side of my Smart Cover. It lightly scratched my screen; I'm thinking just the oleophobic coating. I had already managed to put two much larger scratches in the screen on my own, but as it seemed the Smart Cover had caused some damage, I figured a call to Apple Support would be worth a shot (no Apple stores near me...).

I had a very nice, short and to the point conversation with a representative. He immediately offered to replace both my iPad 2 **and** my Smart Cover, both of which I had bought at Best Buy on launch day, for no charge!

After I was done talking with the representative, the wire fell out. It looks like it was just some wire that got lodged in the Smart Cover, so, my fault *not* Apple's. I emailed the representative and he said the replacements were still valid.

TL;DR - I scratched my iPad 2 with my Smart Cover, Apple replaced them both for free, fully knowing it was my fault!",13,32,2011-05-26,AAPL,0.08720376342535019,0.8535710573196411,0.05922510847449303

what do you think? [Promo Codes inside]","It's a board game that I invented and implemented as an iOS game. The game is called Connect2Win and it has really simple rules (""connect your corners to win"") but still features deep strategy and interesting gameplay. Connect2Win is OpenFeint enabled, and also uses Game Center on the newer iOS versions. Leader boards and achievements worth 750 points are available on both services. This game (which belongs to the class of connection games) includes specially optimized graphics for the iPad and for Retina devices.

P.S.: I also re-released the game on J2ME, which is on most non-iPhones. [Get it here](http://www.mobilerated.com/connect2win-9814.html).


disclaimer: I posted s.th. similar when the game first came out, but I had posted it to the /gaming subreddit where it was downvoted really fast - I guess there are many who don't like to see iPhone stories. Now I've got an update with minimal modification through review, and thus got fresh promo codes - enjoy!
