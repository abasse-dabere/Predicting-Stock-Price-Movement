iphone,Life long Android user bought an iPhone 8 Plus in 2019 and use it as daily driver. Here are my thoughts,"* Screen

In 2019, there is hardly any LCD flagship Android Phone out there, almost all of them are OLED, which absolutely destroy my eyes since OLED screen flckers at a low frequency. I can really feel the burn after using my previous daily driver Pixel 2XL in a dark environment like on a airplane for like 5 minutes.  On the other hand, the LCD on the iPhone is probably the best in the entire industry without PWM, and this is probably the biggest reason that I bought this phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

* iOS 

iOS 13.1 feels very fast and responsive, but as a person who previous said to others ""Android is also pretty fast these days"", I have to say iOS is just on a whole new level, everything is instant, everything is effortless, even you need to wait for the processor, the transition animation cleverly mask them away. In fact, it's so damn fast and fluid that I am annoyed about the frametime spikes that only occur once in a while(unlike my Pixel 2 XL, tons of dropped frame if the app is poorly coded) and this is the perfect transition to the next topic that I want to talk about, the Apps 

The apps on iOS is almost always better that the one on Android, especially the Apps I use, and the difference can be night and day. More features, more responsive, even Google's own Youtube app runs better on iOS, you can double tap the right portion of the screen to skip forward 10 sec without waiting it to buffer.

&amp;#x200B;

* Apple Watch

This is the second reason I switched to iOS, Apple watch series 4/5 just blow the competition out of water, hands down.

&amp;#x200B;

* Endurance

Contrary to some battery test video over youtube, the battery life on my 8 plus has been great. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL, I feels like the 8 Plus lasts even longer, easily carry me through the day with 7 hours screen on time, that's with Bluetooth paired with Apple watch and location always on.

&amp;#x200B;

* What's not so great?

AppleWatch,The breathing app is a life-saver for anxiety,"Had a dr. appointment today. 

She told me to get some bloodwork done.

I don't hate needles, but blood ***really*** scares me. I felt my heart-rate going up and my palms get sweaty as I got called into the room.

When looking at my wrist I realized I had the breathing app on my watch. I quickly turned it on for 5 minutes while they used my other arm, and just focused on the breathing exercises.

Made it out there like a champ! Barely event felt light-headed.

Thank YOU Apple Watch. It's the small things! Also fun to see my heart-rate go haywire for that short 15 minutes spent in the lab.",95,834,2019-10-02,AAPL,0.044811662286520004,0.9239487051963806,0.031239621341228485

AppleWatch,Apple Watch 5,"I'd never considered having an Apple watch, but then 'fall detection' arrived.

I pondered buying one for a while...what use would I get out of it as a mid 60s female....I don't need music, weather, news etc on my wrist ...all the usual thoughts.  But the fall detection really kept my interest.  

Then I was out for the day in a UK city, and had to keep looking at maps to see where I was, find a coffee shop, find the Apple store (just to have a look around in there), find somewhere for lunch, and how the hell do I get back to the train station having wandered aimlessly around.  And I found myself looking around me all the time my phone was in my hand, being aware of the amount of phone snatches that  happen in UK cities now.  And I thought how safe it would be to leave my phone in my bag, and speak to a watch...""Siri, where's the nearest coffee shop"" etc.

So, I've bought one.  It arrived yesterday, 4 days early and it looks beautiful.  Rose gold with blue/grey strap.  I set it up, paired it with the phone, and customised a watch screen. I switched off things I wouldn't need around home, like messages which come into my iPhone and iPad, so I hardly need another nudge to answer 😂 and I thought it would preserve battery life.  One notification I left on was for an app on my phone called Oatbook.  This is a warfarin anticoagulant monitoring app, and I get a reminder each day to take it, and then ✅ the day in the app as taken. 

This morning I got the chime on my watch...Oatbook.  Even without my glasses I saw ""mark as taken"".  And I thought ""oh yeh, as if it's going to react to that extent with the app 😂😂😂😂"".    

I  tapped the notification on the watch  then opened the app on my iphone to mark today's warfarin taken, and I was gobsmacked...there in the app was the green ✅...marked as taken from the watch.  Wow...just wow.

This Apple watch is going to keep me safe around home (fall detection) and it will be so useful when Im out.  Siri and notifications will be turned on as I have days out or have a few days away at the coast, and my iPhone can stay safely in my bag 💕


EDIT...the second day and I've just marked my warfarin as 'taken' again from my watch.  I'm ridiculously excited about this...💕",152,1053,2019-10-03,AAPL,0.05360395461320877,0.9168369770050049,0.029559049755334854

AppleWatch,Apple Watch saved me legally,"Yesterday I set up a meeting with a stranger to sell my iPhone 11 at 21:00 near my apartment. Long story short, I had a feeling something wasn’t right so I put a voice recording on my watch. When I handed phone to the guy he ran away. I tried to get him back and he started beating so bad that I got a concussion. I screamed up ”HELP!! HELP!!” with a hope that someone will help me catch that guy. Luckily some some people nearby helped me catch that guy. I then called the police. When the police arrive, since I got injured so bad so they took me to the emergency room at a hospital. The guy who hit me was a addicted guy, he declared at the police station that I assaulted him. For that reason I was taken from hospital to jail for investigation for a night. The morning, I told the investigator what happened and all the evidence recorded in my Apple Watch. So it was clear I was a victim. So they released me and asked me if I want that guy to be punished...
Lastly, the police smile and said ”Technology..” aiming toward to Apple Watch when I handed him the voice file.

I specifically did not close the side so that it was visible what was inside. The butt is polished and tactilely smooth.

AppleWatch,Apple battery replacement experience,"This is simply amazing. I made a post a couple weeks ago here about bringing my OOW 1st gen(not series 1) Apple Watch in after I saw the battery swelled and popped the display out. It hasnt been used for years and was a couple months out of the extended battery warranty.


However I went to Apple and showed them the watch, and they deemed this was strictly a battery issue and no damage to the device(display still worked)

They said they’d charge me for a battery replacement ($99 CAD) and in turn I’d actually receive a replacement Apple Watch instead. I thought that was insane considering I was out of warranty and these watches are not cheap in Canada, even the very first Apple Watch. He then told me, if they don’t have the 1 gen in stock, they’d give me a s1/s2. I thought nothing of it.


Skip a month later, and after a couple calls to Apple for updates and delays, they finally told me it was ready. I go in the next day, and they said they didn’t have the 1st gen in stock, *so they gave me a brand new s3 replacement*. This was for a $99 battery repair and ~~I got 4 generations newer of watch~~! (edit: 2 generations newer) I tried this watch out when I got home and it’s miles faster than the 1st gen- super happy with Apple and their customer service.



**TLDR**: I brought an out of warranty 1st gen watch, and only paid $99 and got a brand new s3 instead.",88,601,2019-10-21,AAPL,0.05299092456698418,0.8823427557945251,0.06466630101203918

iphone,iPhone 11 Review,"Hello Again,

I wrote last year this review and it got huge responses on the iPhone XR and figured why not do it again.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9zorpd/iphone\_xr\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9zorpd/iphone_xr_review/)

&amp;#x200B;

So I traded in my Product Red 128GB Iphone XR, for a Black iPhone 11 and here are my thoughts on the device if your deciding on making the move.

Design and Build

Pretty much same as last years XR, but I do love what they did with the Camera bump this year with the one milled piece of glass. Not sure how that magic is done, but it gives the phone a 3D look to it and the matte on the camera bump does make me wish for the entire thing to be matte. Again Aluminum body which is fine as almost all flagships are still doing aluminum for their phone bodies, aluminum is much easier to machine as steel is much harder to machine and cost a lot more to money to produce.

Weakness of this year's lineup is the colors to me, they went very easter egg pastel colors, I would like more rich colors, but that is a matter of taste. Would love a midnight blue, or like the Product Red which is a deep red. The purple is nice if you like purple and its probably to me the best new color. The Green is very spearmint to me and i prefer darker greens then the lighter shades. The removal of blue was kind of a head scratcher as it was my 2nd favorite color to Product Red in last years Xr. I went back to black, well because black goes with everything, and to be honest I got tired of the colors, maybe I'm just basic.

Screen

Same screen as the XR which is fine.....  This phone screen is good, if you a screen nerd its not going to blow you away but its far from people saying it sucks, and it's a 720P screen.  First off its not 720P its 828P ok!

Also the PPI is 326 and people complain how its low rez, but say how awesome the iPad Pro Screens are at 264.... Yes it is a sub 1080p panel, but there's more to a screen then just resolution. Color, Brightness, is all here and it's very good. iPhonedo did a review on the 11 recently and compared the phone without telling you which phone was which doing a 4k source video on both. The note made it 1440p and the iPhone 1080p then to 828p, I'll be honest during the blind I thought the iPhone was better looking.  Now I am not saying the iPhone 11 has better screen then the Note, but in certain images with a lot of light and color the iPhone will hold its own against it, it just won't when it comes to dark things because OLED will always be king here.

Battery

1 Hour longer then the battery champ Xr, sign me up! This is the simplest part of the review the Xr was great at battery and you get 1 hour longer, this thing is a tank and is only really surpassed by the big brother iPhone 11 Pro Max which lets face it has just a huge battery.....

But one note good on Apple to finally listen and make the Pro's thicker and bigger and put a good size battery finally in these things. People ripped on the Xr ""budget phone"" and ""thic boy"" but in the end lot of tech people went with the Xr over the Xs because of battery life. Apple is killing it right now with battery life!

Camera

This is the main reason why I traded in my XR. Apple killed the camera this year, I have a two year old and my phone is my camera, so when the cameras have huge upgrades like this year, I upgrade because I take pictures of my baby with this device and I have it on me at all times. Now I know DSLR and real cameras take better photos but we are getting closer and closer to saying a Phone Camera is close enough that everyday people don't need a seperate camera, and professionals in the next few years might not either.

Wide Angle was the right move, I actually mentioned it in my XR Review that I would prefer Wide Angle to Telephoto, I am very happy with the 2 camera array that Apple chose the Wide Angle. You can just take way more dramatic shots IMO then a slight zoom from the telephoto.

Last years XR has a great camera, but the software seems to do weird things sometimes with the Smart HDR, in perfect light you will get great shots on the XR but when the lighting isn't ideal the XR can fall apart. All of this has been fixed in the 11 and improved by a huge amount, only issue I have seen with the 11 is it does like to sharpen a lot, but honestly you might like that and it's only really weird if you zooming in on objects in the photos.

Night Mode is amazing and puts it right up there with the pixel. This camera is amazing at night where this was the XR's Achilles Heel IMO. You will be able to take photos and just wow yourself, go out and take some night photos because you never could before with an iPhone.

Video is king on this phone, Image Stabilization is crazy good, so much I didn't even need a tripod setup doing video with my kid, but when I showed people the video they were surprised it wasn't on some kind of tripod setup.  4k 60 on the back and front, the iPhone is PowerHouse when it comes to Video and IMO no other phone is even close.

Summary

So in summary, good design not great, performance champion, and camera that is amazing. This is the iPhone to get for most people, if your a screen snob or really want that telephoto lens then there is the pro, but man this year there is even lesser reasons to get the pro.

The iPhone 11 lower price of $699 now, which you should never get by the way grab the 128 gb for $749. And the Pro which is smaller size and 64gb storage which you can't get 128gb so you have to move to 256 gb for $150 more. So now your at $1150 or $1250 for the max. To me the telephoto and the OLED are not worth $400 - $500 difference it just isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again for reading the review and I hope this helps your buying decisions if you plan on getting a phone this year!

apple,"AirPods Pro impressions from NYC: subway noise, coins pocket test, comfort and more","I'm in NYC and just picked up my AirPods Pro. I've seen a couple other posts of impressions so I'll try to cover stuff that hasn't already been done to death. Feel free to ask questions.

* **Apple Store:** Hot tip: If you buy them in-store, set them up next to the line of display iPhones. Absolutely hilarious to watch a full line of iPhones pop up the setup box in sync. When you press connect on yours, all the other ones will switch to ""Not your AirPods Pro."" If that's not a ""pro"" experience, I don't know what is lol.
* **General Comfort:** I liked the original AirPods because they felt invisible and was a little worried about these, especially because earbuds like my Jabra Elite Active 65t buds take a little finagling to get them in right and get a seal, and when you do, there's pressure. AirPods Pro really surprised me. The tips feel excellent, *almost* invisible once they're in, and I didn't have to adjust at all to get a good seal. The Ear Tip Test is cool, very quick, and to my surprise confirmed I did get a good seal. That vent makes a massive difference in comfort, holy shit. Also, small note, but they look much nicer in ear than regular AirPods. Stem is way less noticeable.
* **Sound Quality:** If you like the way AirPods sound, you'll like these more because of the seal and reduced outside noise. Bass hits a little harder, you notice a little more detail in songs, etc. If you don't like how AirPods sound, you'll like these a little more but they won't blow you away. It's what you'd expect, nothing crazy. *EDIT: Had more time to test the sound quality. It's actually a bigger step up than I thought previously (I was mostly paying attention to ANC quality). The seal makes a big difference but honestly the drivers are just better.*
* **Subway and Street Noise:** This is the noisiest city I've ever been in. Near the Apple Store there's a lot of construction going on near the subway—jackhammers, construction workers, huge trucks, just really annoying chaos. I walked to the Apple Store wearing my regular AirPods and it was not fun but it's what I'm used to with them. Walking back to the subway with AirPods Pro cut a *ton* of the noise. I could still hear some of it obviously but suddenly I wasn't annoyed. When I got to the subway, I walked down the steps and saw that the opposite direction train was already there, just started to turn around to see when my train would arrive, and then WHOOSH, it flew by me, arriving. I literally didn't hear it *at all*. That's crazy. All I could hear was Kanye. On the subway itself, I couldn't really hear anybody around me and could barely hear the train. I switched to a podcast and it was like having the people and train at 20% volume. With normal AirPods on the subway I'd listen to podcast at like 80-90% volume; with the Pro I literally turned it *down* to about 50-60%. Amazing. Then on the walk home, I couldn't hear anybody on the street despite seeing people chatting or talking on their phone (on speakerphone of course). It was great.
* **Jeans Coin Pocket Test:** Saw some people worried about this as well. I can confirm that these *do* fit in my jeans coin pocket *better* than the old AirPods. The case for the old ones was more squarish, so I always had to kinda *push* it in a little bit. The Pro case on the other hand is long and narrow so you just turn it to the side and it slips in super easily. [I took a quick video here.](https://imgur.com/CeJwTUm)
* **Negatives:** They're white so the case still picked up lint from my jeans which is annoying but oh well, the controls definitely take a hot minute to get used to, and again, the sound quality isn't gonna blow you away if you didn't already like the way AirPods sound. So far those are my only negatives.

Obviously it hasn't been that long but I was literally grinning while walking home because suddenly NYC wasn't as loud and annoying anymore and I could actually hear my music and hear myself think. I'm super happy with these so far.",1005,5352,2019-10-30,AAPL,0.056053221225738525,0.9141455292701721,0.029801277443766594

iphone,My iPhone 11 Pro saved me at work this week,"I want to preface that I’ve been an Android user for the last six years or so. The last iPhone I had was the 4. 

I'm a professional videographer/editor based in Toronto and for one of my gigs I needed to get a timelapse of the city during sunrise. The last week we've had some crummy weather with little to no sunrise and this Monday was the only day of the week where we’d have a proper sunrise. My project was due this week, so I didn’t have any other opportunities.

Sunrise was at 7:45 so I wake up at 5:30 am and get to the city by 6. All nearby parking is closed off so I had to park 15 minutes away and walk over to my spot. I set up my camera and get ready to shoot my timelapse, and to my luck, I forgot to pack an SD Card... I'm in full panic mode wondering if I should rush back to get one, and I conclude that by the time I get back the sun would have fully risen. 

LUCKILY purchased the 11 Pro three days prior to test it out for the 14 days and I say fuck it, let's see how 'pro' this camera really is.

I put my thermos mug on my tripod, prop my iPhone against it and hit record. Two minutes in, I get a 20% battery warning (yes I should have charged my phone) so I start to panic again because I can’t imagine any phone would last shooting continuous for an hour in 4k, but I got out with 9% left. I get home, edit the footage, and to my surprise, the quality of the footage was actually fairly unbelievable for a phone. It’s by no means perfect, but my client didn’t suspect a thing. The highlights got blown out significantly and you’ll see below, but it retained A LOT of detail.

It’s fair to say that I’ll be keeping this phone simply because it saved me a lot of headache and looking incompetent. Great phone overall too!

For those interested, you can see the timelapse [here](https://imgur.com/a/6VOljSS)

**Tl;dr: Forgot an SD card in my camera and filmed the timelapse with my iPhone and the results were great**

Edit: This was prior to the iOS 13.2 update I believe

Edit 2: I just wanted to make a small note here for anyone saying I, as well as others, are not professionals because I forgot an SD card, and to offer some advice to some aspiring videographers or photographers. Shit happens to the best of us. Anyone saying this clearly isn't a professional in this industry because it's clear you hold a lot of stock in your gear and not your skillset to produce great content. To you, I say, don't limit your capabilities and your creativity based on the gear you don't have. What separates an amateur from a professional is experience, skillset and learning how to adapt. I also updated tl;dr since people complained It wasn't the right format.",256,1934,2019-10-31,AAPL,0.04132353141903877,0.9219542145729065,0.03672222048044205
apple,PSA Do not push any object into the hole of the AirPod Pro’s Eartip,"TLDR: Paper got stuck in my AirPod Pro silicon tip and I used an object to push it out ruining my earbuds mesh. Apple currently does not stock the Tip

Last night I got my AirPod Pro’s and was delighted with the product so I thought I would try the other size tips to see if I’m potentially using the wrong size. Whilst getting the tip from the cardboard the paper ended up staying in the tip... 

So I thought I could just push a needle through the hole to push the paper out I was wrong.. there is a mesh inside of the top to help protect the AirPod’s inner grill.

I have been into Apple today and they don’t seem to currently stock the silicon tips and I now my AirPod does not have the mesh between the AirPod and Earbud.

apple,AirPods Pro vs. Powerbeats Pro vs. WF-1000XM3 (Bonus: vs. WH-1000XM3),"I know a lot of people have been wondering how the AirPods Pro stack up against some other competitors. Now that I have the 3 mentioned in the title and have been able to compare, I thought I would do so. Throwing in the over-ear Sony WH-1000XM3's just for comparison on the ANC, since they're in a completely different category.

**UPDATE 2/1/20** I got a pair of Master &amp; Dynamic's [MW07+ wireless earbuds](https://imgur.com/a/hNJAgch) for review and have added them to this review.

https://imgur.com/a/FkBRRAm

Let's start with ANC, since that's the big new feature of the AirPods Pro:

**Active Noise Cancellation**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **N/A** 
* WF-1000XM3 (in-ear): **8/10**
* WH-1000XM3 (over-ear): **10/10**
* MW07+: **3/10**

Hands down the over-ear Sonys win out of the bunch - nothing can substitute over-ear cans when it comes to ANC. That being said, the in-ear WF-1000XM3's do a really great job, and the AirPods come in just below that. I cranked up my Sonos system in my house last night and blasted it with white noise/airplane noise to simulate the effect, and these were the results I got. Just to clarify, the AirPods Pro ANC isn't *bad*, it just isn't the best of the bunch. It seems a lot of the reviewers who have been raving about the ANC, the AirPods Pro are their first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so it's blowing their minds. The first pair of ANC headphones I owned (Bose QC 35 II's) blew my mind as well when I first heard the effect. Unfortunately this is the weakest selling point of the MW07+ as they barely cancel out any exterior sound, falling drastically behind the rest of the contenders in this category. 

**Sound Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **8/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **9/10**
* MW07+: **10/10**

The MW07+ just took the crown in this category! They sound fantastic across the whole range, have a huge soundstage for an IEM and are the best sounding pair of earbuds I've used thus far. The Sony's come in second with sound that is crisp, clear, with defined mids and clean bass. The Powerbeats are a little muddy in the mids and a little too bass-heavy, and the AirPods Pro come in just a notch below - overall they're just lacking the richness that comes from the other options, but still a noticeable improvement over the Airpods 1/2.

**Comfort**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **6.5/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**
* MW07+: **8/10**

The shape of the AirPods Pro along with their light weight definitely make them the most comfortable of the bunch. The Sony's are just a notch below but are still comfortable after long listening sessions. Powerbeats are heavy and the outer piece will begin to get uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them. The MW07+ buds aren't necessarily the most comfortable, as they're a little on the larger and heavier side, but where they score major points is from having 4 different sized silicone tips to choose from, as well as 3 different sizes of silicone ""wings"" that you can choose to fit your ear perfectly. Aside from the Powerbeats Pro with the wraparound back, these are by far the most secure fit of any earbud I've found.

**Battery Life**

* AirPods Pro: **5/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **9/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **6/10**
* MW07+: **10/10**

Not very subjective, just the facts here - AirPods Pro last 4.5hrs, Sony's last 6hrs and the Powerbeats last 9hrs per charge. Since receiving the MW07+'s, I'm going to have to knock 1 point off each of the previously reviewed buds, as they take the cake for battery life - 10 hours per charge, with 3 charges in the case, for a total of 40 HOURS. **I used these earbuds for about an hour a day for an entire month before I needed to charge the case.**

**Connectivity**

* AirPods Pro: **10/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7.5/10**
* MW07+: **6/10**

Both the AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro win here with Apple's H1 chip for ease of connectivity. The Sony's are just like any other 3rd party headphone that need to be manually searched for and connected, and over my last month of ownership have been responsive in their connecting to the phone. The MW07+'s unfortunately suffer from some bluetooth connectivity issues that are especially exaggerated in certain circumstances, ie. at the gym, walking around a large number of other people with wireless earbuds causes mine to skip considerably, constantly making the music stop and start and even drop out completely at times. By default the earbuds connect through the right earbud (which then sends the channel to the left earbud), and since I keep my phone in my left pocket, the dropouts are considerably worse with this default setting. A workaround I found is to disconnect from the right earbud and connect to the left earbud before going into the gym, which helps slightly with the connectivity issues but doesn't mitigate them completely.

**Call Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **5/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **6/10**
* MW07+: **8/10**

AirPods call quality has always been top notch and the same goes for the Pro. With both the Powerbeats and the Sony's, people on the other end have reported hearing too much background noise, so the AirPods are the easy winner here. No complaints on the MW07+ call quality and the callers on the other end sound great.

**Case Size/Pocketability**

* AirPods Pro: **9.5/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **3/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **5/10**
* MW07+: **8/10**

While slightly larger than the original AirPods case, the Pros win again for pocketability. The Powerbeats are simply too big to be comfortable in your pocket, and the Sony's are only slightly more portable. The MW07+ case is GORGEOUS - glossy, polished stainless steel that's so sensitive to scratches they even give you a cloth pouch to keep it in. Even after diligently keeping it only inside the cloth pouch, microscratches began to appear on the case after only a week or two, so if you want to keep the case pristine your best bet is to leave it sitting out somewhere and never put it inside anything. Otherwise the side is great and it slips into any pocket easily, only slightly larger than the AirPods Pro case.

**Workout/Gym**

* AirPods Pro: **8/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **9/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7/10**
* MW07+: **7.5/10**

Personally, I don't sweat all that much during my workouts so sweat/water resistance has never been high on my list of priority features for an earbud, however the AirPods and the Powerbeats are superior here in that regard. I've taken the Sony's to the gym many times and never had an issue with sweat/water damage, and their ANC being the best of the bunch definitely helps, but they are a bit heavy so during heavier reps when I am making funny faces, it tends to squeeze them out of my ears a bit. The Powerbeats are rock solid when it comes to staying in during workouts. I haven't had the chance to test the AirPods Pro in the gym just yet, so the 8/10 score is purely speculative based on how I believe they would perform, combined with some early feedback from other reviewers. It should be noted that having ANC in the gym is super helpful for drowning out exterior noises, and when I wear the Powerbeats I have to turn my music up considerably louder. As mentioned in the connectivity section, the MW07+'s have trouble at the gym, presumably from all of the other bluetooth headphone connections floating around there. That being said, the fit is so secure that they have taken the second place spot behind the Powerbeats Pro at the gym for me because they don't fall out no matter how vigorous the exercise is.

Ultimately these are all very different buds for very different purposes. Go with the AirPods Pro if you want decent noise cancellation, decent audio quality, easy connectivity, comfort, and you're willing to plop down $250. Go with the Powerbeats if you are ok without noise cancellation, if you want good audio quality (a little bass heavy) but needs something that will stay latched on your ear through even the most intense of workouts. And go with the Sony's if you want excellent audio quality, excellent noise cancellation, and are ok with putting the person on the other end of the line through some less than stellar call quality. At $300 for the MW07+'s, they're definitely not priced for everyone, but if you want the best audio quality of this whole bunch, and a beautiful design that stands out from the rest, this is your pair.

Hope this helps anyone on the fence in deciding between all these awesome buds!",290,1402,2019-10-31,AAPL,0.05534838822980722,0.895603597164154,0.04904799287517866

apple,AirPod Pros feels like walking during the middle of a quiet snowstorm even in NYC.,"Living and workin in NYC. Just bought them tonight, had them on. It literally felt like I was walking through 8” of snow. It was quiet, I forgot I was in NYC. Was talking on the phone as I went onto the Subway platform and I barely heard the train pull up. 

*for anyone familiar with the stretch of 96th to 110th on the 2/3 that’s really loud when it’s grinding through Central Park, I could barely hear that*

The sound is pretty much on par, if not better than the Powerbeats Pro. If you’ve used in ear Beats, the silicone buds are the same material.

I work in a profession where I can suffer hearing loss and have worn the Powerbeats for years to listen to music to drown out the sound with music. These are a huge step up. I’m not an audiophile.

If you’re an average person, these are more than adequate.",264,714,2019-10-31,AAPL,0.04653021693229675,0.9158800840377808,0.03758963942527771
