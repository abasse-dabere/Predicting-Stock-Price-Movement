iphone,"Laser engraved iPhone cases made of Paper - on sale, with a reddit giveaway!","Hey reddit, you may remember [me from this...](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/wejt9/i_started_a_company_making_iphone_cases_out_of/)

...where I gave away 3 iPhone cases to [lucky redditors.](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/wxw40/i_was_one_of_the_winners_of_the_twig_cases_the/) 

Well, with the new iPhone on the horizon, we've put everything on sale, and I've juiced it a bit for Reddit. 

**If this post gets over 100 upvotes, I'll give out a free custom case to someone who posts in this thread.** 

...or one of your choice, if that's how you fly. Slammo.

Check us out if you haven't yet : www.twigcase.com - the best bamboo iPhone cases out there!

[You might like this one in particular. ;)](http://www.twigcase.com/collections/featured/products/the-bunker)

If you're not eligible for an upgrade for the new iPhone, (like me &amp;amp;#3232;\_&amp;amp;#3232;) or you're upgrading from a 3G to a 4 or 4S, this is a good chance to get a sweet case, at a reddit-friendly price.

We'll be rockin' a new case for the new iPhone when it comes out, so stay tuned!

**EDIT: Ermahgerd. That was fast. 100! I'm gonna randomly pick on Monday, but if this hits 500, I will hand out 2 more customs to lucky posters here. I don't even get to keep all this delicious karma D:**

EDIT2: omg. I know why Obama only answered 10 questions. Reddit is unrelenting. I have upvoted every last one of you and will continue to do so tomorrow. TIL what redditors post when they think no one is looking. Please check out our [Facebooks](http://www.facebook.com/TwigCaseCo) as every like makes my mom a tiny bit more proud. 

Edit3: ya did it! You guys are awesome! I'll pick the 3 winners at midnight Monday (cst), so if you're just getting here, post away until then. 

Also, want to shout to my pals Grow Anthology - they make longboards out of the same stuff our cases are made of : http://www.growanthology.com/  [See a Twig Case make a sweet cameo in this vid they made!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Es_O_SRKPw)

Thanks again reddit! It's been fun. [We'll be back with more giveaways soon!](http://imgur.com/gallery/4SPfR)

STILL EDITING6: 9-14-12 -  Two redditors should be receiving their cases early next week. The third one can't make up their damn mind! 	(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Also, we've announced [preorders for our iPhone 5 case,] (http://www.twigcase.com/collections/featured/products/iphone-5-case) and should have a swell new thing soon, which I'm sure I'll have to tell someone about. Because of the swellness.

Helpful tip:
Save your .gif file in the camera roll and when you want to use it 'copy' it, by long pressing on the ""image"" aka .gif, and paste onto iMessage. But remember you'll only be able to preview it in a tiny box until iOS 6, where you'll be able to fully open a gif file.

Red Alert hasn't been updated in a year and crashes constantly for a lot of people. EA just doesn't care about the gamers. I think the iPad is DESPERATE for some RTS games and I think blizzard is the one to do it. And even though they'd be remakes, I think the enjoyment of the original Warcraft games still holds together. There are many that haven't even played the older games, let alone an RTS. I would HOPE that if it happened, multi-player wouldn't have to be online, that it could be iPad-to-iPad WiFi play. Also the idea of touchscreen controls seems like it was made for the genre.

iphone,"For years, my iPhone alarm has chosen to randomly fail on me.. Today, something new happened....","I've been using my iPhone as an alarm clock for years. The reasons why I use my iPhone are because I charge it on my nightstand every night, it automatically adjusts to daylight savings time and it has a battery, just in case the power goes out during the night. 

Over the past few years, regardless of the hardware model or iOS version i'm using, the alarm will randomly choose to not go off. A couple times, it seems, were caused by daylight savings. The rest of the time, it has been seemingly random. I've always just chalked it up to me turning the alarm off in my sleep and not remembering it. 

Due to the inconsistant nature of my alarm clock, my wife sets her iphone to go off 30 minutes after I get up, so I'm guaranteed to not be late for work. We also put our phones across the room so that we have to get completely out of bed to shut them off. 

Despite my redundant alarms, this morning I was late for work. I woke up to the carpool outside my house honking their horn. I looked at my phone and the alarm hadn't gone off and neither had hers! Neither of them were on silent, either!

What is going on? How is it that both my wife and I's phone both failed to alarm? We both have an iPhone 4s running iOS 5.1.1, but mine is AT&amp;T and hers is ACS (Alaska communications). I will never trust my iPhone to wake me up ever again, since i *hate* being late for work. 

I've tried googling it, and I get a lot of hits, but this is the first time i've seen or heard of 2 separate phones failing to alert on time..

apple,iPhone 4S stolen at the Apple store.,"Hey guys, I finally just got this mostly figured out and I figured I would share my experience with you guys.

My iPhone 4S ended up in a glass of water, and destroyed.  I heard you could bring it to Apple and they would replace it for $200 as long as it was on warranty (which it was) so I did.  I got to the Apple store and was getting everything in order when I realized that I left my wallet at home.  The Genius or tech support agent said he would give me an invoice that I could take to the front girl when I got back.  He had made it seem like he needed to keep the phone in exchange for the invoice, and he kept my broken iPhone on his side of the table.  I returned with my wallet and was asked to present my broken iPhone.  I explained the situation to the lady and she didn't even go talk to the guy at all.  I asked him where it was and he said that I had it in my hand when I left.  The lady looked around for it quickly and said there's nothing that can be done, and she was sure that her employees would never accidentally take a phone like that because she trained them otherwise.  I asked about the cameras in the store, and she said that only corporate has access to them, and the only way I could get them checked was to file a report with the police.  I left since I was getting sick of her rudeness, and figuring they weren't going to give it up.  I knew something fishy was going on here about this, so before I called the police I figured I would give Apple a heads up.  I called Apple and told them the situation, that my phone was gone, I left it in a place where there were cameras, and that I was going to phone the police.  The CSR told me that there is nothing that can be done, there is no Apple phone line to deal with a problem like this.  I then called back to the Apple store to ask for the owner or the manager on duty and there was no one answering phones at that location, I eventually talked to a manager at an old location that was moving who was going to take a ""better look"" in to the situation when the stores were closed.  Once I phoned the police they met at my house the same day and the officer seemed to also think there might be a scam going on at the store.  The next day they called me and told me security had found the phone in the mall and returned it to the store.  I then picked up my phone at the store and decided to use a video camera during the ordeal although there was little problem, but after explaining my situation to the guy that was helping me he seemed to know what was going on and wasn't too friendly after that.  I paid and got my phone, then asked to e-mail me the receipt.  I told him what it was and as he was typing it in I went behind him to make sure he was spelling it right.  He had made a mistake and when I told him he pressed okay, then on the blank screen he repeated my e-mail and I said that's what he typed.  Just a little icing on the cake at the end, because I still don't have my receipt.
I'm still waiting to hear back from the police officer that is going to look at the store cameras

TL;DR  Apple Genius's stole my phone, I phoned the police and it magically appeared. Potential scam going on with the employees at the store. Still waiting to hear back from the police that is going to check the cameras.

I'll update you guys when I hear back from the officer, to see what really happened to that phone

The solution is to jailbreak and then install nitrous from cydia (.99 cents).  I was a little skeptical at first but holy crap is Chrome fast now!  Cant imagine the iPad without it.

iphone,"My Opinion on iPhone 5's ""Missing"" Features","I wrote an article [here](http://liteforecast.com/iphone-5s-missing-features), but I'm pasting the entirety of it below: 

After every launch, the entire internet starts up a hate storm about how they were disappointed by the announcement. Macrumors, Reddit, 9to5mac, The Verge, Engadget, Twitter, Facebook. Every website has comment streams flooded with messages about how the Lumia is so much superior, or how the iPhone 5 wasn't radical enough or how Apple has barely caught up with Android. Here's my opinions the iPhone 5's ""missing"" features.

* NFC

I currently own a Galaxy Nexus. Know how many times I've used NFC to share stuff with friends or pay for something with Google Wallet? None. Including technology that isn't widely supported into your flagship phone doesn't make sense. Why add weight and thickness if the extras aren't even widely supported? ​

* Wireless Charging

Again, the same argument: it comes down to adding extra weight and thickness for supporting technology absent in the real world​. The Lumia weighs 183 grams vs 112 grams for the iPhone 5 vs 135 grams for the Galaxy Nexus. adding that much extra weight just to support an accessory? Ridiculous.

* Screen Size

Before the 4"" debut, 3.5"" was too big. After? Apple needed to go bigger. My Nexus measures at 4.65"". I have to use two hands just to send a small text message. I can't unlock the screen if its password protected. I can't even browse Reddit properly because the screen size is too big. Is 3.5"" too small? Certainly. But going bigger than 4-4.2""​ would seem like overkill. I was the fan of the Nexus S and was actually saddened when I saw the Galaxy Nexus at 4.65"". It's too big to use with one hand or to fit in your pocket.

* Lightning Connector

Ever tried plugging in a Micro-USB or a 30-pin dock connector in the middle of the night before going to sleep and after turning off the light? It's not fun. Hell, sometimes I have to turn on the light just to see how the damn connector fits in to my Nexus. People are actually mad that Apple introduced a smaller cable with a reversible cable and not using Micro USB. ​Until I see that this cable is actually a hindrance rather than a help, I wouldn't make up my mind saying that Apple screwed the pooch.

* Radical Redesign

It's easy to do radical designs when discovering the best shape but there's no reason to keep launching new designs when you hit the gold mine. The consumers love the design and are willing to spend money for it. Why change it now? Sure, in the R&amp;D stage, experiment away, but don't try it out on your flagship phone. Apple doesn't have 400 different smartphones in the market like Samsung. They keep it simple and elegant.

* Conclusion

There's no point in adding a new feature unless it directly benefits the consumer. Just by adding random ideas that you can think of into your flagship phone doesn't make it the best phone in the world. Just because you can watch a video while typing a text message, doesn't mean it's revolutionary. Just because you can wirelessly charge the phone using a dock that plugs into the wall doesn't make it mind-blowing. ​

For me (A Galaxy Nexus user) the things I bitch about are the fact that Apple's ecosystem is too closed​ (No defaulting of 3rd Party Apps or inclusion of apps like the barebones stocks app or the Newsstand folder which you can't delete). As for Windows Phone fans, well, we can discuss your issues when your phone AND OS actually launches.",259,464,2012-09-13,AAPL,0.03486889228224754,0.9248467683792114,0.04028435796499252

apple,What many iPhone critics cannot understand: Maximum vs Optimum,"The pissing contest that is thought to be good criticism by the latest SGS3 crowed is fun and all, but I think there is genuine disconnect in appreciation between the Android -- specifically Samsung -- and Apple philosophies. What appears to get lost in the ""my screen is bigger than yours"" discourse are the factors that actually make for a better product no matter who builds it: Usability.

Why I appreciate Apple and most of its products is not for their processor architecture and RPMs of their cooling fans, but for their ability marry hardware and software in such a way that it creates an unrivaled efficiency in workflow.

Example:
NFC -- interesting technology, but way to immature to be seriously considered by Apple. I don't think Apple was even contemplating putting it in the iPhone 5. NFC does not replace your wallet. You can't use it everywhere, you can't even use it at most places, as a matter of fact, you can hardly use it for payment anywhere. The security concerns are widespread, the implementation of gluing stickers on every surface of my possessions so my phone goes on mute, whilst interesting, is suboptimal. Just imagine how much flack Apple would have gotten from its customer base for introducing a technology with such inconsistent benefit and complexity to enable it. The entire Apple eco-system is based on making every feature on every device so accessible to the customer, that he or she feels 100% in control of the technology, all the time. I know that my girlfriend, when walking through the door of our grocery store, gets a reminder from her iPhone that contains our entire grocery list, including items I have put on there from my phone and computer, completely automatic, every time. I know that notes I take at home are with me on my iPad, every time. I know that all my text documents, spreadsheets, presentations for school that I worked on at home are with me, every time; and I can do all that in such a defeatingly easy way that I don't even have to think about it. Apple has build an enormous trust with its customer base by making products that contain some very powerful features and implement them in such an easy-to-use way, that they actually do use them, consistently so! None of my friends, and there are a couple, that have the SGS3 ever use NFC is such a way that it efficiently enhances their every-day life. People that think having NFC is better than not having NFC, no matter what the degree of benefit, don't get it. It would ruin the trust that Apple customers have in the products they pay undeniably good money for. 

And you can go through many pieces of hardware like that. I could not possibly care less about the specs of a processor (and Apple may very well have the better chip), as long as it allows for an efficient use of the features that make my life easier, day in and day out. Apple has understood that the hardware is secondary to the experience it enables. Whatever hardware can guarantee that experience is the right choice. When vertically integrating your product it does not always have to be the maximum of available tech, it has to be the optimal hardware to guarantee every customer the perfect experience Apple is trying to create, every time.

A 5+ inch screen on the phablet called SGS3 not only prohibits me from operating the phone efficiently with one hand, but is actually large enough that -- and I tried this -- it no longer fits in the breast pocket of my shirts. I will spare you the details of how that would be problematic for me, literally every single day of my working life. 

In conclusion, I think the overwhelming victory of Apple in customer satisfaction stems from an understanding that every customer should feel as though they are entirely in control of the technology, and not intimidated by it. If it is easy enough for me to use, I will use it. If it only works at McDonalds, no matter how cool it may be, I wont. I am sure to some people, the ability to have a weather widget and ""customize"" the color scheme put a phone so many light-years ahead, everybody else inevitably plays catch-up, and that's fine. Some Apple fans might argue that there are bigger things to consider…

To me, it isn't about the maximum of hardware features and software options, it is about the optimum -- so everything just works. I think the new iPhone 5 kicks ass in enabling more people to make better use of technology, every day, everywhere.

apple,Here's what the features Samsung listed in their anti-iPhone 5 ad do,"Before I even start typing, I would like to note that this will probably be a little bit biased towards Apple.

So, I'm sure you've all seen Samsgun's latest [anti-Apple ad](http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5054b1bdecad04ba7800000b-1630-3150/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-anti-iphone-5-ad-full-size.jpg?maxX=610). If you haven't, you can go and check it out [here](http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5054b1bdecad04ba7800000b-1630-3150/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-anti-iphone-5-ad-full-size.jpg?maxX=610). Notice how they list a lot of features that the iPhone apparently doesn't have. Well, here's what they do.

**[NFC:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication)** Near field communication let's your phone establish a connection with another phone that is touching it or very close to it. It can accomplish almost everything that Bluetooth can, but in a much closer proximity and without dealing with pairing.

**[Smart-stay:](http://pocketnow.com/2012/06/06/a-look-at-smart-stay-on-the-galaxy-s-iii/)** This feature aims to prevent the display backlight from turning off while you are looking at the phone's display. Critics have said that this feature works fine in well-lit areas, but not in the dark.

**[S-Beam:](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-57455744-251/samsungs-s-beam-teaches-android-a-new-trick/)** This is a feature available in Ice Cream Sandwich, and uses NFC to transfer data between two phones that are held closely together. It does the same thing that the iPhone application Bump does.

**[Share Shot:](http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-57457453-85/a-closer-look-at-the-samsung-galaxy-s-iiis-sharing-features/)** This is an easy way to share photos with another S3 owner. It lets you upload pictures you've taken to another S3 decide through a WiFi network. The iPhone's equivalent is Shared Photo-Streams, only Share Shot only works through WiFi.

**[Group Cast:](http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-57457453-85/a-closer-look-at-the-samsung-galaxy-s-iiis-sharing-features/)** Group Cast is designed for presentations. It lets users view and interact with PDF, PowerPoint, and image files through their phones.

**[Direct Call:](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxys3/smartstay.html#directcall)** This feature aims to know when you want to talk vs. when you want to text. For instance, if you're composing a text message but decide to call the receiver instead, you simply hold your phone to your ear and it will dial their number. (Seems silly to me)

**[Smart Alert:](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxys3/smartstay.html#smartalert)** This feature activates when you've been away from your phone. It vibrates to let you know that you have missed calls or text-messages. It seems like a much more annoying version of Notification Center, BUT you don't have to manually check it-- it automatically notifies you as oppose to you manually checking Notification Center.

**[Tilt-to-Zoom:](http://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-motion-gestures-galaxy-s3)** This feature let's you simply tilt the phone - as opposed to pinching and zooming - to zoom in on a picture or website.

**[Palm Swipe Capture:](http://youtu.be/A-q9OD3jWrc?t=57s)** This feature lets you swipe your palm over your phone to take a screenshot. On the iPhone this is accomplished by simultaneously pressing the Home button and the Sleep-Wake button.

**[Palm touch to mute/pause:](http://www.samsung.com/hk_en/consumer/mobile/mobile-phones/smartphone/GT-I9300MBDTGY-features)** You can mute and pause media on the screen by covering the screen with your hand.

**[Picture-in-picture:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFpLi116jcE)** This let's you watch a video and normally use your phone at the same time by placing the video in a popup window.

**[Turn Over To Mute:](http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/mobile-apps/how-to-use-motion-features-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s3-50008332/)** Let's you turn over your phone to mute incoming calls.

**[Shake To Update:](http://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-motion-gestures-galaxy-s3)** Lets you shake your phone to update the information most apps are displaying. For instance, shaking your phone while in the Twitter app will load new tweets, etc.

**[Removable Battery:](http://#)** Pretty self explanatory. Lets you take out your battery.",331,255,2012-09-16,AAPL,0.04304216057062149,0.9284272789955139,0.028530512005090714

apple,What Passbook is and isn't,"I'm seeing a lot of confusion and complaints about Passbook. Some of this is Apple's fault, because I don't think they have clearly communicated to the public about it (their explanations to developers have been pretty clear — I am a developer — but we've been under NDA about it until, oh, about 24h ago). But also, there's been some really bad reporting by ""journalists"" on the subject. (In quotes, because I was always taught *real* journalists do research on things they don't understand before they write an article about it.)

So, I'm going to clear up some stuff real quick: What Passbook is and how it works.

The best way to think of Passbook is like the Photo Library. It stores a bunch of stuff for you, which you can flip through, and that's pretty much it. And similar to the Photo Library, you can save stuff into Passbook from Safari, from emails you receive, and more. If you have a Mac running Mountain Lion, you can send them wirelessly to your iPhone from there.

When you open up Passbook and there's nothing in it, there's a link to the App Store. This is just Apple trying to be helpful, but I think it has instead confused people into thinking that they must install apps for passes to appear in their passbook. **This is not true.**

So, a common complaint I've seen is ""I don't want to install (company)'s shitty app in order to get their storecard on my phone"". **You don't have to!**

(Unless the company decides it absolutely wants it that way. It's their call, not Apple's.)

Apps *can* save passes to your Passbook (just like they can save photos to your Photo Library), but that's just one option. You can attach them to emails so that, say, when you book a ticket for an event, and Eventbrite or whoever email you a receipt, and a .PDF ticket (for people without iPhones to print out and take to the venue) they could also send you a .pkpass that installs into your Passbook. Or you might install it direct from the website when your order is confirmed. You might scan a QR code in a coffee-shop (using any 3rd-party scanner) and it could offer to install a loyalty card for you.

(Note: no matter how a Pass is sent to you, it won't add to your Passbook automatically — it's just offered to you by iOS, and only added if you accept it. So people can't spam you via the Passbook. This is important, as we'll see in a moment.)

What is a pass, anyway? Well, just a .zip file with a some data and graphics inside it, that's all. That's why you don't need an app to make one; Apple provide source code for web servers to produce them.

Passbook then renders it into something pretty. Since it ends up just being a pretty graphic on your screen, why is it better than just saving a picture of the same thing to the Photo Library?

There are two main reasons:

* Passes can be tied to geographical locations. They'll pop up on your lock screen when you arrive at those locations. This means that when you arrive at the event, or the store, or the departure gate, the ticket is there on your screen ready to scan.

* The information on a Pass can be auto-updated over-the-air. You'll receive an alert about the changed info too — so if your flight is departing from a different gate, or you've run out of credit, you'll know right away.

This doesn't require an app on your system either. It's all web based: if you run a web server, you can provide this service to iPhone users. You make HTTP requests to Apple servers to send over-the-air push notifications to users (they must have accepted a Pass from you first, of course — told you that would become important) and you'll get status updates back.

Long term, this could be a real game-changer for small, local businesses which could then compete with the chains in offering loyalty-card schemes, store credit, special offer coupons, seamless ticketing, gift cards and more — all without needing specialist equipment, printing, laminating, app development, or anything more than a web site with a little bit of scripting on it.

Why have Passbook support in apps at all? Convenience. There's nothing a Passbook-enabled app can do that a website can't, but as we all know, it's often more convenient to use native apps than web apps. So, if your airline wants to let you change your preferred seat from window to aisle, or you want to top up your travel card with extra credit, you could do that via an app, or via their website — it's up to them what they want to provide. And then the updated credit/seat allocation/whatever will be pushed to your phone.",83,539,2012-09-20,AAPL,0.042700815945863724,0.9289703965187073,0.028328780084848404
apple,My personal opinion on IOS 6,"**IF YOU DON""T AGREE, SAY WHY INSTEAD OF DOWNVOTING. Remember reddiquette**

As a long time fan and user of apple products i find myself very disappointed with ios 6. From the first announcement i found myself less than excited. Upon installing this version of IOS i am very displeased. I think that IOS 6 is a step in the wrong direction for apple. Not only did they fail to impress, they made things worse.

I personally was waiting for a refresh to the OS with the update. No i was not looking for widgets, unicorns, or rainbows; I was looking for something new and improved. I was underwhelmed by the features added in the OS. Features highlighted in the update were basic and far from what i would call innovative.

**TL;DR: Too little, too late. Lack of improvement and innovation. I love IOS, but IOS 6 was a step in the wrong direction. Here's to hoping IOS 6.5 or IOS 7 comes out REALLY soon.**

------------------------------------
**I have an iPhone 4S**

-----------------------------------

* **Maps**

-Terrible readability in satellite view

-Terrible pictures in satellite view

-Unable to recognize the name of my school unless I completely type the name up (clarify: I typed prep at the end instead of preparatory and it gave me a no results found)

-Sheer lack of details

-certain streets don't even show up on the map unless i zoom in to the maximum amount

*Verdict: A step in the wrong direction. lets just say i can't wait for the google maps app to come out.*

* **Siri**

-A welcomed update with no complaints but still underwhelming. Googles new Siri Rival has surpassed Siri and made it look obsolete

*Verdict: Good update but underwhelming compared to the growing competition*

* **Facebook integration**

-Hardly a feature at all

* **Shared photo streams**

-Hardly a feature the average person will know how to use let alone get use out of

* **Passbook**

-The highlight feature of IOS 6 to me.

-I hate how it is dependent on the app store and requires you to download an app for every card you want to add even though you will never use the app you are required to download. Why should i download the starbucks app if i'm going to use passbook for my card? The starbucks app is literally just a virtual card.

-Still like it

*Verdict: Cool app that is held back by the app store*

* **Facetime over cellular**

-Hardly a feature with use to most

-Should have been a feature from the start and has been available through skype and others for months.

* **Phone**

-Love the new dialer

-welcomed new features such as replies etc.

* **Mail**

-The drag to refresh animation is cool

-VIP has no use to me personally but i could see the use to others

-Organization is terrible with the placement of VIP. It seems like such a basic error to me and it enrages my OCD. http://i.imgur.com/Eb97f.png. VIP should be placed over ""All Mail"" for consistency. This might seem nit-picky but i noticed it as soon as i opened the app as i'm sure many others did.

*Verdict: No major new features. It's like i updated an app in the appstore that would have the description ""minor bug fixes and adjustments.""*

* **Safari**

-faster? love it

-iCloud incorporation? i will never use it and i doubt many others will

-Offline reading? awesome

-Full Screen landscape? awesome

-Design/UI? Ugly. Compare it to the Chrome UI. 

*Verdict: It is poorly designed and only is redeemed by speed. Offline and full screen are aspects present in third party.  browsers since the app store began. Cool Updates, but i'll stick to chrome.*

* **Accessibility**

-Not a real ""feature"" to most users 

---------------------------------------------------------

**Design**

I was blown away by not only the lack of design updates and innovation, but the sheer abundance of design setbacks.

* **Inconsistencies**

-The status bar changes colors in certain apps, is black in most, and is translucent in others. There should be consistency in the color of the bar. http://imgur.com/a/YLave

* **Set Wallpaper Annoyance**

In IOS 5 you could scale a photo before selecting ""set as wallpaper"" in order to decide how you want it to look on your screen. In IOS 6 this is not the case. If you scale an image before hitting ""set as wallpaper"" the image reverts to its original dimensions. you must then resize the image while those clunky black bars are present and block visibility for proper scaling. http://imgur.com/a/6sbAa

* **Ugly Implementation of Colored Status Bars**

http://i.imgur.com/42ypj.png

The Blues do not match the the apps they are supposed to pair and compliment. They clash. The screen shots make them look 100000 times better than they do on the actual phone. I think it has to do with how blaringly different they are than the black bars on (almost) every other app.

* **Outdated Lock Screen**

The lock screen design was never spectacular or pretty from the start. The black bars take too much screen real estate and look ugly compared to most others.

As a graphic design enthusiast and amateur graphic designer, I could point out so much that needs to be fixed with this lock screen.

* Harsh gradient on the black bars

* Huge bar around the slie to unlock which takes up way too much space

* The black bars themselves take too much space

* The translucent status bar does not match the translucent lock screen bars


Compare the aesthetics too a more minimal design such as this

(my mockup of a more modern version) http://i.imgur.com/R5onq.jpg

(Jail Break version) http://i.imgur.com/MlxEd.jpg

* Emphasis on typography and content

* Simple lock screen does not cover or block wallpaper

This one has flaws aswell

* the slide to unlock needs to be more ""obvious"" than the one shown

* There needs to be a status bar since the content in it is illegible 


The lock screen needs a major face lift, not a tweak.

* **Black Camera App bar**

-Heavy gradient

-Stray from Apple ""grey/chrome/metal/whatever-you-want-to-call-it"" theme

-Subjective to say the least. It's not ugly... but it's worse than it was before.

* **Ugly Blue Theme in IOS""**

IOS features this ugly blue theme that i can only equate to windows XP. Apps such as safari, mail, settings, and more feature this ugly blue themeing (which was done away with in the app store).

mine's back to IOS 5 style. Isn't everyone's or am i special? I didn't want to complain about my appstore being retarded if it wasn't like that for everyone. Mine was like the new version the first few times I opened it.... now this

apple,"I just got my EarPods, here's my initial impression","**Edit:** I've now written my actual review, in part also based on feedback I got from this thread. The review is available [here](http://veven.org/reviews/2012/09/apple-earpod-review/)

I'm reposting this, which was originally a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/105u45/would_you_get_a_pair_of_earpods_just_to_have/c6aw3jm) in /r/headphones:  

I just got mine an hour ago. Some observations/early (and highly subjective) review:

First of all, there are very nearly _no_ microphonics. I can bang the cable on my desk. This is quite unlike any IEM you have ever tried, and also very different from the old Apple earbuds.

They fit my ears pretty well, and I hardly feel they are there - I guess this is the feeling some people have about them coming out.  I was worried about that too, for all of 30 seconds.  I can headbang with them, and they stay in my ears.

No isolation - you can still hear any and all sound around you that rises above the music.  This is both good and bad - in terms of things like traffic/pedestrian safety, it's good that we aren't getting an army of EarPod zombies.  It does however cause people to crank up the volume more than necessary.

As for the fit - the best fit I found was inserting them, pushing and twisting slightly - and the fit is somewhat important here, as the tonal balance changes quite a bit depending on how you've inserted them

As for the sound:  While Apple's marketing of their sonic qualities are somewhat hyperbolical - I'm not going to sell of my HD558's or my B&amp;W C5's any time soon, they really are quite good:

First of all - they are the very first pair of earbuds I've heard that actually play bass.  I've taken them through Roger Waters' ""Three Wishes"", Joss Stone's ""Less is More"", K&amp;D's ""Jazz Master"", Yello's ""Blender"" and Katie Melua's ""Halfway up the Hindu Kush"" - all tracks which are taxing to get right in the bass department.  Joss Stone's track sounds tame if there is not enough, and bass becomes completely overwhelming if it has a bump in the upper sub-bass region.  

The EarPods have fared very well on all of the tracks. I could tell Roger Water's voice from that of the Genie.  Blender had the correct amount of kick without getting bloated (The kick drum on that track peaks at 41 Hz), Joss Stone sounded just right, and it's the same story with Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister and Katie Melua.

A note here: The ported design of the EarPods are very much for sound, and not, as conspiracy nuts would have you believe, to ensure others hear your music.  Cover up the two port holes on the earpod stem, and like with a vented speaker, all bass disappears.  

As for the rest of the frequency range:  The multiple ports, and lack of seal/isolation is not just for show either.  Sonically, they have much more in common with open over-ear headphones than they do with IEM's, and when evaluating them, you should evaluate them on that basis. They have that open, airy quality that an open over-ear offers over closed headphones.  

The tonal balance overall is very pleasant - there's nothing that sticks out either in the midrange or treble - for lack of a better word, it's all very _pleasant_.  Which is sort of my harshest criticism of them which is:  It feel like the pleasantness and airy qualities come at the expense of some detail - it's slightly reminiscent of a picture taken with a soft focus lens. All very lush and pleasant, but it feels like you're missing some detail. If I need to hear more details of a recording, I'll reach for my C5's and HD558's any day.

However, they are about a billion times better in this department than the old Apple earbuds, and I did some quick testing against my Nuforce NE-700X, and I'd say they are on par with the NuForces, but with a more open quality (And they lack the overly bloated bass of the Nuforces).

Amplification:   I've tried them unamplified from my iPhone, through a FiiO E5 and my O2/ODAC.  They're picky about what you connect them to.

When I tried them with the E5, bass was _noticeably_ weaker, almost to the point where I started suspecting my E5 was faulty, so I had to recheck with a few different pairs of headphones.  Turns out there's nothing wrong with my E5, but it's a bad match for the EarPods.   They do love my O2, though.  

Conclusion? If these hadn't been made by Apple, hyped by Apple, and bundled with the iPhone and iPod, I firmly believe that people would have said they were a bargain.  They are considerably better than a headphone like the Sennheiser CX-300, and if you evaluate them as an _open_ headphone (read: If you don't need all that isolation), I really think it's a bit of a bargain at $30.
