apple,"When the Apple Genius accuses you of modifying your iPhone… A story of my worst Apple Store experience, and how a manager fixed it.","I have an iPhone 5S.

I bought it a little over 2 years ago, brand new from AT&amp;T.

I did not buy AppleCare.

My iPhone's battery stopped working. I fully expected to walk into Apple, pay $80, and walk out with a new battery.

Things did not go as planned.

Background: For the last 6 months my iPhone 5S’ battery life has been degrading. The battery was slowly losing it’s ability to hold a charge. About a month ago, charging cables that worked fine with my iPad stopped working properly with my iPhone. About a week ago, I would plug in my iPhone to charge overnight and it would only charge to about 20% by the time I woke up.

Finally, it happened, my iPhone lost it’s charge, and it refused to charge any more. The “Low Battery” indicator would not even show up. Either my battery was fried, or something was wrong with my charging port.

I finally made an Apple Store appointment. I’d been avoiding it, because when the battery problems first appeared, my phone was already out of my 1 year warranty, and I didn’t want to pay for a new battery.

Yesterday, I went in for my appointment. I waited in the back near the Genius Bar until the tech could finally see me. He began to inspect my phone (which is in excellent condition, by the way) and I described to him my battery issues and how they’ve progressed over the last several months. 

I asked him if the charging port was broken, he inspected it with a flashlight and said it looked perfectly normal. I’m relieved, I hoped the issue was with the battery, because that’s easier and cheaper to replace than the charging port.

As he’s inspecting and running his fingers over the back of my iPhone, he asked me where I bought the iPhone, and I explain that I bought it brand new from AT&amp;T over 2 years ago.

The technician nodded and then took my phone into the back to inspect it.

After 10 minutes, he comes back out.

“Sorry, but we can’t service your phone because it’s been modified.”

What?

I’ve never had this iPhone serviced, I’ve never “modified” my iPhone. I was completely baffled. I asked the tech what he was talking about.

He points to the FCC text on the back of the phone.

“It’s crooked. We can tell. This isn’t an official Apple backplate.”

He runs his fingers over the back of the phone.

“See this? You can feel it, it’s fake. It’s not supposed to be this way.”

He holds my phone in my face and points.

“Right there, it’s crooked, you see? Here, feel it.”

I just stare at the tech in disbelief. My friend is with me, he gives me a look. I explain to the tech I bought the phone brand new from AT&amp;T, I pulled the plastic off the box and the iPhone, it couldn’t possibly be fake.

He tells me it can’t possibly be new. He insists I must have used a phone replacement program or an insurance program to get a used phone from AT&amp;T.

The tech tells me that they inspected the screen, and that it was also a third party screen. I’m extremely frustrated at this point, and I’m trying to stay calm.

The tech continues to insist that my screen and backplate aren’t “Apple Official”. He says they can take my phone in for a couple days to try and service it for $80, but if they find any “unofficial internal parts” they will be unable to service my phone and return it to me unchanged.

I take a moment to evaluate my options. I’m, frankly, insulted. The tech has indirectly accused me of lying about buying my iPhone new from AT&amp;T. I take my phone back, give him a look of disbelief, and say “No thank you.” 

I stand outside the store, frustrated as hell. I use my friend’s phone to ask one of my friends what I should do. They tell me I should ask for a manager. So I walk in and politely ask for a manager. 

The manager is great. She apologizes for the bad experience and takes my phone into the back for a second opinion. After a few minutes, she comes back and says the back of the phone appears to be “bulging slightly”, but that they haven’t yet opened it up to see if, internally, it has “unofficial parts”. 

She says that I will pay for a new battery ($80) and get a full device replacement. I am handed over to a different Apple Tech. I give him my iPhone, he then gives me a new iPhone that’s the same model, I pay them $80, and I’m good to go.

The takeaway; when your Apple Genius is bad, ask for the manager! (but always be respectful of course)",183,324,2015-11-02,AAPL,0.21972990036010742,0.7534248232841492,0.026845300570130348

apple,"Downvoting in /r/apple has gotten out of control, and we are determined to try and fix the problem!","Hello, /r/apple! It's been awhile since we talked, so we want to keep you all informed on what's going on behind the curtain.

There's one elephant in the room that we want to talk about today. We want you to know that we have taken notice to the high amount of downvoting that has been going on here, especially in /new. It seems almost all submissions are at 0 karma within minutes of it being submitted. We've also seen brigading from other subreddits who think it's fun to upvote things that are anti-Apple and downvote things that are pro-Apple. We welcome all types of posts and comments, regardless of it being pro- or anti-Apple. But the patterns that we are seeing are not indicative of this community being the ones who decide what sees the front page or top of the comment section.

And honestly, it's a problem with most technology subs.

We've tried to disable the downvote button for those who are not subscribed, but that's easily disabled and doesn't work for those on mobile.

However, we refuse to accept this problem as something that is inevitable and impossible to control. So we're determined to try and do something about it, and we've been discussing at great length what the solution is. We don't know for sure what will work, but here we go:

Starting immediately, karma scores on comments will be hidden for 60 minutes. You will see [this](http://i.imgur.com/YnOtwNe.png) instead of a karma score for the first 60 minutes that a comment is made. And since this is a subreddit setting as opposed to CSS, it can't be disabled. We feel that this will prevent bandwagon voting and allow for truly high-quality comments to make it to the top more easily. You will also notice that submission karma is hidden for 60 minutes on new posts. You will now see [this](http://i.imgur.com/ELkUiq9.png) for 60 minutes instead of a score. Again, we feel that this will prevent brigading and bandwagon voting.

With this in mind, please let me remind everyone what the upvote/downvote buttons are for. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to this subreddit or is off-topic, downvote it. It's as simple as that.

Regarding the downvote button specifically, here are some guidelines straight from the [Reddiquette quide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

Do **NOT**:

* **Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

* **Mass downvote someone else's posts.** If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

* **Moderate a story based on your opinion of its source.** Quality of content is more important than who created it.

* **Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.** Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

We hope you all can understand these changes and will hopefully see some positive change come along with them. If you have any questions or concerns for the mods, please let us know below! We are experimenting with this, but we are more than open to reversing our decisions if they don't help or taking suggestions from the community.

We have more changes coming soon, so you'll see something in the near future.

Thanks!

I thought I'd make an Apple Watch RPG style app based on Health Kit data, focused around steps, running, sleeping, and nutrition. I started working on this app a week or so ago and pitched the idea to a friend or two and got generally negative feedback. I'd rather not waste my time with it if it's not something people would use, so I wanted to ask people who actually have the Apple Watch! Nobody I know does unfortunately. Would you use this app?

Here's a very quick video demo. Mind you, it's only got a week of work on it so there's not much to see hahah. It's just here to give a general idea of what I'm talking about.

apple,"""Find my iPhone"" solved a burglary raid","I'm a huge Apple fan and also work as a police officer in Scandinavia. In the last couple of weeks there have been a lot of burglaries in our town. Last night it was yet another one. The burglary seems pretty professional done and we had yet to find any good clues to who is behind. The family said they were missing a lot of electronics, some expensive wine, silver, jewelry and an iPad. I asked if they had ""find my iPhone"" activated, which they didn't know what was. I asked if they had iOS 9 installed. He said ""I updated some things a couple of months ago, but I dont know."" I gave him my personal iPhone 6 and he logged in to iCloud with his Apple ID.

The iPad was traced to a small parking lot about 15 minutes out of town. We sent a patrol and yep! Two guys with the car full of stolen stuff and two extremely surprised faces. 

We are now investigating if the same guys are behind 5+ burglaries the last weeks.

iphone,I made Multiple Exposure! An app that lets you shoot full resolution multiple exposures on your iPhone.,"Hi Reddit, I'd like to show off my app that's taken me a few months to develop.

[Download Multiple Exposure for iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/multiple-exposure/id975001289?ls=1&amp;mt=8)

**What does the app do?**

Multiple Exposure allows you to shoot full resolution in camera multiple exposures on your iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

**How much does it cost?**

The app is normally $0.99, but it will be free for the remainder of today for all of you wonderful folks to try.

**What is a multiple exposure?**

A multiple exposure is a technique in photography which dates back to the days of film. Photographers would take multiple photos on the same frame of film. Using exposure and a bit of imagination, you can come up with some really cool photos.

Here are some examples of multiple exposures:  
[Google Images](https://www.google.ca/search?q=multiple+exposure&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1404&amp;bih=875&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIwOr-p-D7yAIVQ3s-Ch0e_QY5)  
[Flickr Pool](https://www.flickr.com/groups/multiexpose/pool/)

**How do I use the app?**

• Press the little button to expose.  
• Press the big button to expose and save your photo to the photo library.  
• Try playing around with the exposure levels using the exposure compensation dial to get different effects.  

Your feedback helps me improve the app and add the features you want! I’d love to hear what you think! Thanks!

**Edit**  

If you come up with something cool, feel free to share it with the hashtag #MultipleExposureApp!  

**Edit 2**

Also, feel free to submit any of your creations to the app's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/multipleexposureapp).  

**Edit 3**  

I’d like to thank everybody for their feedback and comments. You’re all too kind. Using your feedback, I will try my best to make Multiple Exposure your go to app for shooting multiple exposures.

His app is literally higher up in the top grossing charts than Skype and Netflix. Crazy.

EDIT: Just to note, he's earning money through in-app purchases, the highest being over $10, to see the top 100 people who view your profile. Of course this is all a lie, yet he's still on the app store, likely earning over $50k a day from a scam. To put it in perspective, it's 5 spots down from Candy Crush in the grossing charts, which earns $750k a day. Who said crime doesn't pay.

UPDATE 2: The app has now been removed from the Android Play and iOS app store, likely after it was found the app was sending account credentials to an unknown server. Hopefully that means the guy won't get a payout.

iphone,Switched to an iPhone after using Android for 5 years. Here are my thoughts.,"I had been a loyal Android user since 2010. I've used handsets from many different OEMs (Samsung, Moto, HTC, some Nexus phones, etc). I bought an iPhone 6s Plus about a month ago. Here are my impressions.

**Bad**

* Siri is awful. Just absolute hot garbage. ""Hey, Siri"" doesn't work most of the time. Voice recognition is terrible compared to Google Now or even the Xbox One Kinect.

* The inability to run apps in the background is annoying. It makes using third party cloud storage apps frustrating, and also causes issues with Plex, Audible, etc. Really any app that syncs a lot of data.

* The way folder icons is handled is dreadful. The little mini icons are impossible to see, and it makes finding a particular folder difficult. Everything sort of blurs together and looks the same. Android handles this so much better.

* Google Chrome crashes more than any Android app ever did. I would switch to Safari, but I can't get Safari on my Windows PC. I would switch to Edge, but I can't get Edge on my iPhone. I'll live with the crashes for cross platform capabilities, but it's very annoying.

* Google services just don't integrate or work as well overall. Google Maps seems to have weird issues at times. I don't get the same notifications or reminders.

**Good**

* Non-Google third party apps tend to look and act better

* Family sharing with my iPhone-owning relatives

* Bluetooth headphone support is greater. My gym headphones have an app for the iPhone that lets me see the battery life, etc. There's no equivalent Android app available.

* No obvious hardware/software bugs. Every Android phone I've ever owned has suffered from some issue or another (wonky GPS, inexplicable battery drain, etc)

* Touch ID is fantastic. I haven't used the new Nexus phones, but it's much better than the Note 5's fingerprint scanner, which wasn't that bad.

* The ability to get support from my local Apple store. Problem solving Android phones was a complex runaround involving numerous calls to the OEM, to the carrier, to Google, etc.

Overall, I'm happy with the device, but not really sold on it. I'm open to switching back to Android in a year or two, or staying with the iPhone. I'll reassess the market when the time comes to upgrade.",183,200,2015-11-09,AAPL,0.15408360958099365,0.8151503801345825,0.030765997245907784

apple,PSA: You can set Siri's audio feedback to reflect the ring/silent switch!,"For those of us who have inadvertently had Siri go off in a classroom or a meeting, this setting is much welcome. It's new to iOS 9.

Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Siri &gt; Voice Feedback and select [control with Ring Switch.](http://imgur.com/ArEkvfn)

Now, Siri will give you voice feedback normally when your device is not on silent. But when you switch it to silent, she won't talk out loud but will still give you text prompts, similar to the implementation on the Apple Watch.

Note that you'll still get voice feedback if you use ""Hey Siri,"" have  headphones in, are connected to a Bluetooth device, or are using CarPlay.

iphone,Some lesser known features I have noticed in iOS that I thought I would share!,"I noticed som features in iOS that no one or a few have talked about and I think they are worth sharing :)

Train your touchID: 
You can ""train"" your touchID to recognize your finger better by going into the touchID settings and place your registered finger on the sensor, moving the finger slightly every time.

Emoji scroll:
Scroll through emojis quickly by holding on the emoji categories on the bottom and then drag.

Quick voice memo:
3D Touch on voice memo to quickly make a voice memo.

Cheating touchID:
So this on is more of a minor hack. Simply add one more finger to touchID and when you're on the second step of adding your touchID switch to another finger. That way you can have 2 fingers in 1 ""finger slot"".

Record your screen:
If you want to record your iPhone screen,
hook up your iPhone to a Mac with a cable.
Open QuickTime app
In the menu of the QuickTime app select ""new movie recording""
Press the little arrow on the lower right and select your iPhone and then record.


Some slightly more known features but worth mentioning :)

Lock focus length:
Open the standard camera app.
Hold on the object you want in focus and you will lock the focus and the exposure.

Open safaritabs in the background:
If you go into settings and then safari you can choose if a new tab should open in the foreground or background, pretty nifty.

Vertical panorama:
Open the standard camera app and turn on rotation lock. Then go into panorama, tilt your phone sideways and take a panorama from the bottom down or the top down.

Custom vibration:
This might be one thing that everyone knows but I'll include it. Go into settings and then sound. Choose whether you want to change sms or call. In the sound selection menu select vibration and scroll to the bottom and make your own.

Finding all 3D touch apps:
Go into App Store and simply search ""3Dtouch""

In this case, i recently used TestFlight to launch the beta version of our app to about 250 users.

Immediately I started receiving complaints about the process - many users weren't receiving the notification email.  Then, to make matters worse, Apple ""revamped"" the UI of iTunes Connect, which introduced a lot of bugs.

An Apple agent emailed me after I submitted the issue online.  I compiled screen shots and commentary for all the bugs I found then I got a call a few days later letting me know they were working on them and they should be fixed in a day or two.

Well, two weeks passed, but I just got a call from Apple letting me know they fixed the issues.  Sure enough, I went to the site and everything I pointed out is working!

apple,The Macbook Air 11 is seriously underrated--even by Apple,"I bought an 11 inch air about 9 months ago now.   It replaced a 2010 model white Macbook which had 

The newness sheen is off the device.  It's amazing, and not even Apple seems to value how amazing it is.  

A lot of people on this board said I should get the 13 inch or 12 inch retina models.   The 13 inch pro feels gigantic.  My fiance' has one, and it's nice but 11 inches is a magical size as it fits into things designed to hold 8.5x11 inch sheets of paper.  So I can carry mine around with my gradebook and folders full of paper in the accordion file thus creating a single trove of everything I'm working with.   

I don't really get the shit people give the screen.   I work all day in Microsoft stuff, yes I can tell the text isn't quite as sharp as it is on the retina displays but it doesn't hamper my working at all.  At work  I use Safari  One Note, Powerpoint, Excel, and Word which all look fine.  

I never take my charger to work and I never have a battery issue.   This may speak to how little computer time first grade teachers get sitting down at a computer.  But when I do it's infinitely better than my work issued windows device.    The keyboard is kind of amazing as well.  Not only is it comfy (unlike the Surface and Macbook 1 keyboard) it's small enough that I don't miss a number pad because my fingers don't even need to stretch to reach the number row which was always a big tradeoff on their older 13 inch designs.   

And then I take it home, plug it into a 27 inch monitor and it's wonderful for moderate gaming. (telltale adventures Starcraft 2, Hearthstone etc)  I've got a whole bucket full of USB things and with two ports plus power and display separately I don't have to fuck around with a bunch of adaptors.   

I don't really get why even Apple doesn't feel more enthusiastic about the 11 inch air.   It's always treated as a compromise device but it feels amazing.  No one even really makes a competing device, the only other 11 inch devices are lower end or use lower power chips and i just love the compromise it struck.  Maybe for someone else these are all crazy compromises but for me it feels just in that sweet spot where it's powerful enough to drive my games and a big external display it has the ports I need but it's wonderfully small and portable.",193,214,2015-11-11,AAPL,0.0641469731926918,0.9079095125198364,0.027943504974246025

apple,The actual reason behind F.lux for iOS being pulled,"Sure, it uses private APIs, but thousands of popular projects on Github (like game simulators) or that Apple TV web browser project all use private APIs and they are just fine.

The issue is F.lux for iOS is not a true source-available download. It includes a full app bundle with pre-compiled binary (which in a nutshell, is an extracted .IPA file) packed within Xcode to utilize Apple's new free signing policy. 

And to making things worse, the same F.lux Xcode project does not only allow side loading F.lux itself, but also **any** unsigned IPA file. The only thing a user needs is to extract an unsigned IPA and drag all resources into the project. This allows pirates to install any stolen app, without the need to buy a developer certificate. I have tested and believe this is the true reason for F.lux project being pulled.

apple,iPad Pro. It's a tougher decision because of those storage sizes. Anyone with the 32Gb version?,"**tl;dr** It makes the choice a tough one. Has anyone gone for the 32Gb? How are you finding it?

**Long Version** I picked up an Air 2 recently, and then the Pro launched. Initially I was not looking at the Pro but the jump between my £479 Air 2 and the £679 Pro is.... Well... £200. When you are already spending near £500 on a tablet there is part of you that feels a little buyers remorse. Especially when the Air 2 is already a year behind the curve. Currently my iPhone has a better SoC and GPU than my tablet and that feels strange. The iPad pro also has double the RAM!

So. The fact is the Pro has a lot more potential beyond Internet and Netflix/Media. But it would do those things better too since the screen is significantly larger. I can also grab a pencil and a keyboard later and expand it. I can't pretend I am some graphic designer but I have owned a Galaxy Note in the past and I loved having the stylus for doodling and drawing. The Pro will obviously be far beyond that (being a large surface with much more accurate stylus).

I guess I have not figured out what I want the Pro for specifically which is what's making me unsure. I don't have a laptop so it would fulfil that function, but that's fine as I don't need a full blown desktop OS on the go.

So 32GB is in stock right now but that seems quite low. Especially for a productivity device. 64GB would have been perfect but 32GB seems like it will fill up just by having a few apps over 1Gb in size and videos etc. Especially when the OS will eat up a few Gb too.

That means going up to 128Gb which is a whooping £800. Now we are basically at the price of a laptop..... And I still don't have a keyboard.....",81,100,2015-11-14,AAPL,0.026064349338412285,0.9183012843132019,0.05563437193632126

apple,"OSX Photos app, iPhone, iCloud Photo Library - A guide to deleting pictures","I have spent hours trying to figure out the Photos app and how it interacts with my iPhone and the iCloud Photo Library. I have found a lot of great info here, but no clear, self-contained explanation of deleting photos in different places. Maybe I missed it somewhere.

I have:

**Macbook Pro (2010) -** OS 10.11.1 w/ Photos app; iCloud Photo Library turned ON; My Photo Stream turned ON

**Mac Mini -** Same set up as the Macbook Pro. I use this as a media server for my TV

apple,"Enough OS X ""apps"" that just wrap a web app.","I've personally been getting pretty frustrated by this, and I imagine others are at least frustrated by its effects, not always necessarily explicitly realizing the causes.

OS X ""native apps"" that are mere wrappers around some web/JavaScript app are horrible. Plain and simple.

I have no problem with JavaScript and web apps in general — I've enjoyed developing such things. But they belong in the browser. They should NOT disguise themselves as a native app or try to replace one.

There are certain expectations people have from native apps: the fluidness, speed, responsiveness, battery efficiency, integration, consistency with system UI/gestures, etc.

Web apps simply do not meet those expectations. They are limited by their nature — JavaScript is a scripted language (granted, the engines are [getting better](http://arewefastyet.com) quickly) and does not have access to the sorts of efficient system frameworks that native apps do.

---

## Example: iTunes (Apple Music)

I can't believe that the Apple Music portion of iTunes is a web app. I can't get myself to imagine a reason that anyone at Apple thought this was a good idea.

It's clear *why* it might've been **convenient**: you only have to write it once, and it'll port to Windows trivially.

But that's ridiculous. This is an app made by Apple internally. And it clearly sucks: the scrolling is jerky, the forward/back gestures are crap, transitions are nonexistent, things are slow to load, etc.

Those are things that are acceptable and somewhat standard in the realm of expectations for web apps.

There isn't a single good reason this is the case other than not wanting to pay a little bit extra so some engineers can write a dedicated native app separately for OS X and Windows.

**IN FACT,** if I were granted access to Apple's private APIs and the ability to integrate DRM decryption, *I personally* would be happy to write Apple a full-featured iTunes Apple Music native client in Swift for OS X. For free. No paycheck necessary.

apple,Apple Store in my area has a deaf sales associate,"Went to the Apple store to take a look at the watch since Pay finally came out in Canada (although only on Amex but w/e I like Amex and I use it as my primary card anyway). 

Anyway, I go into the Apple Store and its busy as usual, couldn't find a rep to flag down, after a few minutes I see a nice looking guy in a grey apple t-shirt and I flag him down and go ""hey can you help me with the apple watch"". He quickly does some hand action (which I didn't catch) and proceeded to put down his macbook on the apple watch fitting mat and typed ""Hello, how can I help you"". For the next half-hour we communicated by typing on his laptop. I ended up trying on a couple apple watches and finally picked up the sport 38mm in space grey. 

During this process we had a conversation (via typing) like I would have with any employee, all with emojis and jokes. It was one of the most amazing and personable experiences I've had shopping in retail. Not sure what I'm trying to say here, but I just felt like it was kinda cool Apple has employees like that on their front-lines. 

As I was leaving the store I asked the greeter about the pencils on the iPad pro (none were on display with the demo), he told me ""they're all stolen"" followed by an awkward 5 second silence (as he was waiting for me to leave) before he goes ""maybe try that guy in the middle, he might have one"".

TLDR: Tried on and bought an apple watch from a deaf sales associate, got better experience than someone who was fully able bodied.

I could have easily just walked out with it. Upon returning the pencil the Apple employee even mentioned ""Honest person right here"" or something along the lines of that.

I would have expected the pencils to be treated like an Apple watch where they monitor your usage of the pencil. If not at the least tag it so it rings the scanners when it exits the store.

Apple did not appear to have trained the staff or issue any measures on how to prevent Apple pencil theft (unless this is store specific as I'm not sure what the procedure even is).

apple,A Med student's review of the Apple Pencil,"Hey everyone. I just got my Apple Pencil the other day, so I tried out my iPad pro in class for the first time. 

Here's a sample of my notes:http://imgur.com/a/67QgU 

App I used: Notability

The Apple Pencil is actually the closest thing to a fountain pen in digital form that I've used. Pressure sensitivity is excellent, and it's so fast it feels like a real pen. Palm rejection is also flawless. After 6 hours of note taking today, I'm sitting at 50% battery on the iPad, and 59% on the Pencil, so it's more than enough for one day of notes, and knowing that I can plug it in for less than a minute and get a few more hours of use is peace of mind :)

If anyone has questions, I'll be happy to answer them tomorrow! 

MASSIVE EDIT WITH COMPARISONS:

**Vs the Cintiq:**

It's a bit faster than the Cintiq, but what makes it great is that the pencil just FEELS better. The Cintiq pens feel like they are made from cheap plastic, and while the apple pencil is also unapologetically plastic, it's sturdy, and clean, instead of feeling chintzy and studded with buttons. It's also a more 'normal' diameter for a writing utensil, contributing to far less hand fatigue. The other elephant in the room is the weight and size of the Cintiq vs it's capability to be hooked up to a desktop. However, it's really the old golden standard for stylus quality. 

**Vs the SP3 With the new update, and the low pressure settings.**

I will say this again and again, but Microsoft is the only company that has demonstrated that it can compete with apple on vertically integrated hardware and software. The writing experience on the SP3 is much better with the new update, but still not quite as smooth as the apple pencil. While the activation pressure and sensitivity curves are great, the fact is the Bluetooth tech is far less accurate and has a lower refresh rate. The apple pencil sends out a signal at 240Hz whereas I'd guess the surface is around 75Hz or maybe 120Hz. That doesn't sound like a big difference but I notice about 2-3x the latency - not a big deal for slow writing or drawing, but a big deal if you're scribbling to take notes and writing small. I really appreciate that the surface pen is easily stored away though. Windows on the surface can be buggy at times, but is getting better and better, so if you need a full desktop OS then this is your device. For just note taking alone, I still think the iPad pro is better. It's just a matter of time now that the hardware is out, before developers start taking advantage of the iPad pro.

I purchased a mechanical pencil from Office Max for $4, called the Sharp Mechanical Pencil and it had a removable clip. Sure enough it fit the apple pencil perfectly. The clip is sturdy, and tight. 

Make sure you get the mechanical pencil that says ""sturdy metal clip"" on the back of the package, so you get the metal clip vs the plastic clip. The clip slides in the apple pencil through the tip side of the pencil. 

Problem solved.

apple,"[iPad Pro] Here's a comparison of my notes with the same settings on Notability, one with the Apple Pencil and one with a microfiber tip stylus.","[album on imgur](http://imgur.com/a/BC2U2)

The first two images compare the notes taken with an Apple Pencil vs a microfiber tip stylus, which was what I was using before I got the Pencil. The notes were both written with the same pen settings (same size, NOT the pressure sensitive style ink) and important: they were both written using zoom mode. In this comparison, the microfiber stylus notes looked better to me because a. I am not used to the Apple Pencil yet and b. the microfiber tip provides more friction, so I feel that the strokes are more... deliberate?

However, the third image is notes taken with the Apple Pencil and microfiber tip stylus WITHOUT zoom mode and the difference is huge. Apple Pencil truly shines and wins by a landslide in this case. I would have written more lines but it was too painful to write with the microfiber tip stylus without zoom mode.

The last image is just another page of notes. I LOVE the Apple Pencil so much. It's great for writing casually (without zoom mode, which significantly hinders my workflow) and also drawing. I'm in love. I've been singing its praise and convinced two classmates to splurge so far.",103,131,2015-11-21,AAPL,0.031835585832595825,0.9219952821731567,0.04616910219192505

apple,"If you work somewhere that has a lot of Apple computers and iOS devices and you aren't running a machine with the Server app, you should **really** consider it.","TL;DR: Among lots of other potential benefits, the Server app acts as a caching server for OSX and iOS updates (and more) so users download them internally on the corporate network instead of from Apple.  It is pretty seamless, easy to set up, and totally invisible to the end-user.

------------------------

I work in the IT department of a medium-sized private liberal arts university. The *vast* majority of our students run Apple laptops; I'd guess it is at least 70%, if not more.  Basically all students have smartphones and most have iPhones.

Unfortunately we also have a congested internet line (we're looking upgrade) so one day I was thinking of a way to save bandwidth.

It turns out the Apple Server app has a [caching feature](http://www.apple.com/osx/server/features/#caching-server) where it will download OSX/iOS/etc updates from Apple to distribute them on your internal network, so when there's a big popular update you can have it downloaded 1 time from Apple and then downloaded 499 times from your server, instead of 500 times from Apple.

Here's a quick version of how it works: You turn on the caching feature and it contacts Apple, telling Apple there's a caching server available at that IP address.  Depending on settings, any OSX/iOS updates originating from that IP address are re-directed by Apple to the caching server on your network.  The caching server does NOT pre-load any updates; they have to be requested by someone first.  The first download of each update is started when the first user requests it -- the server downloads it from Apple and then feeds it to that first user, simultaneously.  Any subsequent requests from anyone else for that same update are then downloaded directly from the caching server at whatever speed your network and your server can handle instead of getting it from Apple.

If you have a crazy amount of users, you can set up multiple servers on the same network; they automatically figure out load-balancing, etc.  You can set them up to serve only certain parts of your network if you like.  If server A has an update but someone under server B needs it, server B will request it from Server A first instead of getting it from Apple (and will get it from Apple if server A doesn't have it).

It will handle complex networks setups (multiple external IP addresses, lots of subnets, etc) as well, as long as you can add an entry to your on-site DNS server.  There are a few other parameters you can control, such as the maximum number of concurrent users.

At first I thought this would be a nice way to save a little bandwidth, but really, the main advantage is the *time savings* and the user experience.  When our internet line is pegged at 100% usage (which is most of the day for us...college students love Netflix...) and you can only download an update from Apple at maybe 1MB/sec and it's 2GB worth of updates, wouldn't you rather get it from a server directly on your internal network at 100+MB/sec instead?

It doesn't take much in the way of hardware, either.  I have it running on a cast-off 2010 Mac Mini that we had laying around doing nothing.  As long as it has a decent amount of storage space and a gigabit ethernet port, you're good.  Upgraded RAM and an SSD would be nice (apparently it will keep commonly requested updates in memory for faster serving), but they're not necessary.  I'm using it with that machine's basic 4GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive.

Right now I only have it running in our workshop but when our internet line is maxed out and a machine I'm working on needs tons of updates it makes all the difference.  Say I'm working on 3-4 student laptops at once, and each needs 500MB of updates but our internet line is maxed out.  Instead of taking forever to download, it takes each laptop maybe 7-8 seconds to download all those updates from my server.  I've also used it when re-imaging a lab full of Macs; 30 iMacs that all need 2+GB of updates would take forever downloading directly from Apple but it goes fast with the caching server.

It isn't a perfect program though.  I do wish it would tell me the internal IP of the machine that requested the update. It has a nice logging feature to tell you what is being downloaded, how much it has served, and a lot of other stuff, but not that for whatever reason. EDIT: Corrected in the thread below, looks like I just need to run a command.

It's $20 from the App Store.  If you have a lot of Mac computers or iOS devices on your network, grab yourself a copy and set up the caching feature.  You won't regret it.",196,676,2015-11-22,AAPL,0.057529620826244354,0.9147418141365051,0.027728501707315445

apple,Non artist's attempt with Apple Pencil,"Just wanted to preface this with I'm not artist.  I never even took a single art class in high school.  I've always had a fascination with art and the idea of drawing but could never complete anything I was remotely proud of.
  
I bought the Apple Pencil on a whim because I stumbled on one available.  To anyone with the remote interest in drawing with on an iPad Pro - make the plunge.  The power of undo, the precision of the pencil, and the apps and tools available make it a whole new experience.  Being able to put a saved photo side by side with the new multi view is phenomenal.  Within 1 day of owning the pencil - I have a whole new interest in drawing that I'm excited to put time in to.

apple,Something I just noticed recently,"My first iPhone was an iPhone 4. I've since gotten a 5 and a 6 (and I'll probably get a 7). I understand that I shouldn't really be able to complain if I keep getting Apple products, but there's something that has frustrated for awhile about iOS that I never really noticed until recently. 

In the pre-iOS 7 days, the interface was good. I'm not talking about the appearance (though it was fine for its time), but the UX. I remember being able to tap everywhere and being able to interact with a button, icon, slider, etc. immediately as it was visible, even if animations were still in progress. I could tap an app icon on another page while it was only halfway in view. I could close a goddamn video before the controls faded completely into view. If I wanted to google something, I could take my phone out of my pocket and be at google.com within 1-2 seconds. 

Now, post-iOS 7, I feel like I have to wait for every animation to completely be done before doing anything. Anytime I try to do something quickly, I need to try a swipe or tap again at least twice before the interface actually responds. The most frustrating thing is the goddamn video controls. I tap the screen to show the controls. I tap the done button as soon as I can see it, and the controls go away. I'll do this dance two or three times before actually being able to hit the button and close the video. If I want to google something, I need to tap the home button, wait for the screen to turn on, wait for Touch ID (which I understand is a separate issue that will likely get faster over time), wait for the home screen to pop into view before being able to open chrome, after which the app shows its previous state and hangs for 2 seconds before refreshing and suddenly ending up in a completely different place (this isn't just a chrome thing. Every single app I use does this), and then I can do the thing I originally wanted to do. I don't like all the animations, I don't like having to wait when the previous UX didn't need to (if this was something that was a problem since day 1, I would be ok with it. But this is a regression in functionality), and I've been considering moving to android, which I won't do because there are several things that apple will always just do better.

apple,For those who switched from Windows to Apple computers: what were the main differences? Drawbacks?,"Hello everyone, 

I'm thinking about changing from a windows laptop to one of the Macbooks, the light one (the cheaper model). I am not particularly interested in why apple is good (or bad), many articles write about the general traits, just what were the main differences when you switched? The advantages and disadvantages? (esp. what about managing your files, favvie softwares, etc). Are there any functions there were in Windows and you missed them on your Mac? What was better after the switch?  I'd like to hear some serious argumented answers rather than 'apple is better'. 

Thanks

apple,Apple's packaging of 2m Lightning cable in iPad pro box - impressed!,"See example: http://imgur.com/yd32lg9

Apple has done a very good thing in their iPad Pro packaging, and by doing so, they're setting a good example.

Their 2m Lightning cable is packed exactly how it should be. I was just part of a lengthy discussion about Apple cables failing, and it seems much of it has to do with how people (mis)use the cables. You should never bend cables past 90° (edit: around a small radius like people tend to do with small cables). In the packaging Apple has employed for the iPad pro, the cable is circular, rather than folded multiple times like virtually all of their cables are with other products (with iPods, iPhones, standalone cables, etc.).

This, of course, took more space. But, if people took a hint from Apple and started transporting/packing their cables like the iPad pro cable was originally packaged in the example above, there would be far fewer cable failures. 

Edit: This is neither here nor there, but I've noticed that since this gained traction (and probably made frontpage for many), I've gotten more and more negative comments about fanboyism, etc. I never came here to insult anybody, so keep it civil, would you? The conversation has been interesting thus far, and it's clear people are in two distinct camps about the issue. But ascribing an entire comment/viewpoint to 'rabid Apple fanboys' completely undermines any sort of logical discussion. 

Edit #2: By even a conservative measure, no cable should be bent in a radius less than 8x the diameter of the cable itself. For a shielded cable, 12x. Doesn't matter whether it's an Apple cable or a non-Apple cable. A lightning cable is 2.5mm in width, which means at 8x (conservative estimate) the cable should never be bent more than 20mm, or just slightly more than at 3/4 of an inch radius. It becomes well over an inch (30mm) if you use the 12x shielded cable estimate.

apple,"A (different) power user's experience with the rMB 12"" 1.3 GHz processor - definitely usable, and much more powerful than I thought it'd be","About a month ago, I started looking at replacing my old MBP from 2010. I spent a lot of time researching my options, and while I *knew* I *should* save up and buy a top-of-the-line rMBP for my needs, but a graduate student budget kept me away. The new Macbook's size/portability/feature set had me convinced I wanted it, but I was concerned it wouldn't be able to handle my needs. There were many posts, comments, and threads about how it can't crunch video, but I'm an audio engineer and programmer. Since there were no threads regarding my specific need set, I wanted to chime in and potentially let other buyers in my situation know my own two cents. 

About me and my needs/uses: I'm a graduate student in acoustics, plus I'm a composer and audio engineer using Logic exclusively. I code embedded audio and also c++ AU and VST plugins, plus lots of Max/MSP coding. My doctoral research requires that I use **lots** of Matlab as well. The rest is standard computer usage (general internet, LaTeX, watching/streaming film/TV, etc.). I sprang for the 1.3 GHz processor and 512 GB internal hard drive, a maxed-out Space Grey rMB, and given my purchase date it's running El Capitan. I figured if it simply wasn't usable I had a month to return the machine. 

So everyone is familiar with my comparison machine: my old 2010 (pre-Thunderbolt) MacBook Pro had a 2.66 GHz i7, 8 gigs of RAM, 512 gig 7200 rpm hd, and an Nvidia 330M video card with 512 mb vRAM. 

My first impression when I took the machine out of its box: holy moly this thing is TINY. My undergraduate degree is in electrical engineering, and I have NO idea how Apple managed to make something this small a totally functional computer. No UI lag like many others have said the machine suffers from, things overall are extremely snappy. It isn't just a sidestep from my old MBP - it's a clear upgrade in terms of speed. The keyboard did take about a day and a half (had the machine for three days now) to adjust to typing on, but by now I'm typing just fine, and I imagine I'll be typing as fast as I can on any other keyboard within a week or so. I don't ever really use more than one USB port at a time, I got the AV HDMI/USB-C/USB-3 adapter to keep around and it's showed no interruption in my workflow yet. 

The first test: Logic Pro X. I rely heavily on Eventide and Waves plugins for audio production and music making, both of which brought my old MBP to its knees. I never use more than eight tracks (plus maybe 4-5 aux channels) running at 24/96k, and at any time at most three to four tracks are playing - usually it's two at the same time. Where I got frequent CPU spikes on my old MBP on every release past Snow Leopard, the new rMB has little-to-no trouble. The processor will get occasional jumps, but rarely above 75% on either core. I imagine bouncing audio might take about as long as it did on my old machine, but that remains to be seen. In a worst-case scenario, I am keeping my old MBP around and can do all recording/mixing on the rMB then move the project to my MBP to do the bouncing for the sustained processor load (with the added benefit that I can now use my rMB while the bounce is occurring, which would freeze up my old MBP and make it unusable during the bounce). 

Secondly: Matlab. I code extensive binaural audio processing models. My code runs 35-50% faster on the new rMB without a hitch. Things in general are much more stable and snappier. My code processes and runs very quickly with no lag at all. Testing some quick non-base 2 FFTs showed increased timing and performance from my old MBP. 

My Max/MSP code is extremely intense with lots of delays and filtering (I create room models), no processor hiccups at all and code is extremely efficient with minimal draw on the processor. Xcode is extremely usable, screen size isn't an issue and projects compile without issue. 

I almost exclusively use Safari, I'm not a Chrome user. As expected, it's snappy. I never keep more than ten tabs open and usually only have 3-4 at most, and it's running just fine. Other general performance is no issue, the machine is snappy. 

Would performance have been better if I instead settled with a maxed-out 13"" MBA? Probably, but I really wanted a retina screen. Would a maxed-out 13"" rMBP have been faster? Probably. But I'm seeing no hits in performance yet, and having the smaller size and weight really is a joy - a tradeoff I'm willing to make. 

For any sustained loads that won't run, I'm planning on keeping my old MBP around and using a VNC client to move the files and run them remotely on the old MBP. But so far I've not had to do that. 

If anyone has specific questions please feel free to ask and I'd be happy to address them. But so far I'm very happy with the machine and expect I'll be keeping this one for usage as my main machine.",107,181,2015-11-29,AAPL,0.04653453826904297,0.9197007119655609,0.03376477770507336
