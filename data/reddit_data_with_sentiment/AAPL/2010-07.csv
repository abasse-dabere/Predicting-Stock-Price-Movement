The person at the Genius Bar explained that the batteries swell at the end of their life; I said that the battery still had a fair amount of life left in it.

iphone,"I'm looking for a replacement pair of headphones/earphones for my iPhone, with a few requirements. Suggestions?","Hi iReddit,

I've had an iPhone for about 3 months now (3GS, if it makes a difference?), and I've been sort-of happy with the stock earphones that come with it -- however, I'd like to get a new pair for a few reasons:

* the stock ones don't seem like they have great audio quality 
* they hurt my ears after a while
* they're white, and I'd prefer something a bit more discreet

I've been having a look around, and there's heaps out there, but nothing that quite does the trick, or they're all missing one or two key features. My list of must-haves:

* be some sort of in-ear style headphone/earphone (preferably with silicone or something so they're comfy)
* have an integrated microphone and button, for taking calls
* have at least decent audio quality

And my list of nice-to-haves:

* have integrated volume control on the remote/mic
* be black

I've actually bought quite a few different pairs from ebay and dealextreme, but they were all crap -- either no button or mic, or bad quality (like the cheap and nasty sound you'd expect -- distorted, flat, no high freq's, no real bass), or no volume control, etc.

I've also looked a few times at getting the separate headphone connector that has a mic, button, and socket to put your own headphones into -- not too bad, but it's only a single button (no volume control), and then I can't find any good in-ear phones to put with them.

I'm at wits end, and have been looking for a few months now -- any suggestions, reddit?",38,13,2010-07-05,AAPL,0.09158449620008469,0.881247878074646,0.027167698368430138

iphone,Alien Blue 1.0.4 (Reddit Client for iPhone) is now available.  Here's what is included...,"TL/DR: You can grab it from [here](http://itunes.apple.com/app/alien-blue-unofficial-reddit/id370144106?mt=8).

Hi everyone,

Apple just approved the 1.0.4 update!  It may take a couple of hours for it to be rolled onto the App Store for your country.  Here's what you can expect from this update:

** New in v1.0.4 **

* **Inline comment entry** - designed by the very talented Redditor [barelythere](http://reddit.com/user/barelythere)
* **One-tap quoting** feature when replying to comments.
* Subreddit Re-ordering
* Added ""All Reddits"" Option
* Added ""Ultra-Low Contrast"" option for night reading.  Created predominantly for the **iPad** release.
* Swipe posts to **reveal URL**
* Added **Save Image** Feature to Inline Images (Reveal by tapping inline image).  * Saving from Browser view is coming very shortly.
* Jump to Context from ""My Comments"" in the Messages View
* New Option: Default Order for Comments (Best/New etc.)
* New Option: **Comment Score Threshold**
* New Option: Comment Entry Style (to switch back to classic mode if preferred)
* New Option: Crop vs Full Image Uploads
* New Option: Compressed vs **Full Resolution Imgur Uploads**
* Performance updates in Settings Panel (complete re-write)
* Performance updates in Subreddits Panel (complete re-write)
* Removed memory management notifications (like ""Reducing memory use"")
* Fixed: ""0 mins"" bug in Messages and Comments View
* Fixed: ""Double-Keyboard"" in Landscape text entry
* Fixed: Usability issues with Reddit Account creation (and invalid password entry) in Settings

** NOTE: ** If you see some of your suggestions missing from this update, please don't worry, it's on my list and it will be tackled.

** What's coming up for 1.0.5? **

* iOS4 Performance Updates - ** Round 2 **
* iPhone 4 **Retina Screen** update (High-res icon and glyphs)
* Safari Bookmarklet : For **rapid** posting to Reddit via Alien Blue
* Ability to switch to High-Res imgur images from the Browser View
* Ability to save images in browser view (similar to Safari)
* Back, Refresh, Forward navigation in the internal browser
* Self-posts will be more easily distinguishable
* Orange envelope in full screen mode
* Screen lock (password protection)
* Ability to subscribe to subreddits from Alien Blue

** Features being prototyped at the moment: **

** Account creation (via wizard) **  : I want to make it easier to introduce Reddit to your friends and family (and other non-techies).  The proposed feature will ask the new Redditor what they're interested in (like Technology, Gossip etc.) and will subscribe them to popular reddits matching their profile.  

** Push Notifications (on new messages) ** : I have been prototyping push notifications for Alien Blue, but there is an issue with capacity as the Reddit API allows a limited number of daily requests from a central server.  Currently, this feature would be limited to about 500 users, so I need to check with the admins to see if we can sort something out.

** Search ** : The proposed feature uses a Google App Engine wrapper around Google's search results.  This will give you Google's searching power on Reddit, with results returned in a format Alien Blue is compatible with.

** The Icon ** : The admins haven't gotten back to me about licensing yet, I'm still following up regularly.  There *may* be a slight possibility that the Reddit alien will grace the icon of Alien Blue, but I won't know until someone gets back to me.

There's a bucket load of more improvements and features coming.  The TO-DO list is now at around 110 items, and I'm sure I can push the 150 mark with your feedback, so please keep your suggestions rolling in!

Please be sure to [leave a review](http://itunes.apple.com/app/alien-blue-unofficial-reddit/id370144106?mt=8) on iTunes if you like this update.  I have a strong feeling that reviews make a marked impact on the speed and outcome of the app approval process.

** UPDATE ** : If you guys are having any trouble **editing** your comments, please [check this out](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/cn5yd/alien_blue_104_reddit_client_for_iphone_is_now/c0ttddt).

iphone,I need an iPhone app to force the phone to ring for a particular number when it is on silent.  Is there such an app?,"We are required to be on a support roster and have to be able to hear a call in the middle of the night.  Most people keep their phone on silent overnight and don't want to be woken up by every text or random phone call but need to hear if they are being paged. 
The only apps I can find totally bypass the silent switch – I want to select a number to do this.  I know this can be done by setting a silent ringtone and having a different ringtone for the number but I only need silent at night time and this means a lot of playing around each day to set it up.  Any ideas?

iphone,"Can anyone explain to me how iOS 4's implementation of ""multitasking"" isn't absolutely terrible?","* It isn't multitasking at all. It is an API to allow for applications to continue accessing a small set of functions while not in the foreground.

* The apps don't run in the background, but it at least saves the app's state so you can go back to where you left off in the app right? No.

* The UI implementation is terrible. There is no distinction between quitting an app and backgrounding it. The ""multitasking"" bar includes all the apps you have opened since you last used the phone - essentially creating a pretty useless and cluttered ""recently used apps"" menu disguised as multitasking.

* People have been complaining that the above behavior is causing location aware apps that you do not want to be running in the background to keep the location service enabled and wear down the battery. Making me have to manually manage my list of ""recently used apps"" that I never intend to access because it is useless.

My biggest hope: The dude who wrote Backgrounder creates a new implementation using the visual elements of Apple's UI (which would be really nice if the actual implementation didn't suck so badly) allowing you to single click to close an app, double click to background an app using Backgrounder's method. Backgrounder is already able to detect native multitasking in an app - hopefully he will be able to implement it so that it seamlessly uses Apple's native multitasking when available, and otherwise Backgrounder's multitasking.

A girl can dream.

i tried using entirely FINK for my python programming, but some libs are way too old (pygame, for example). i tried using OSX's built in python, but easy_install failed to install pygame. i tried installing pygame from their OSX package online, but it complained that i don't have python 2.6 installed (but i do).

i want to completely uninstall python and start over, but i have no idea how to do that. google says ""remove /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework"" but i don't have that folder. it says /usr/bin/python is a symlink, but it's not. so i don't even know where that binary came from or how to remove it.

what am i doing wrong? i understand that changing operating systems means changing the way i think about certain tasks....but i can't help but really miss my linux package manager. all the devs i know who have macbooks do most of their development on remote linux machines or in VMs. that's ok for a work environment, but not for a hobbyist programmer or a student like me. does anyone have any tips for development on OSX? specifically how do i manage libraries, packages, etc. is there just no way of keeping track of installed libs?",15,6,2010-07-11,AAPL,0.21187938749790192,0.763134777545929,0.024985823780298233

i used to use an old ibook to do media playback and such on a TV when i go over to friends houses. i've been using Remote and Rowmote on the iPod Touch to control itunes, VLC, boxee and such. well that iBook is now dead, and i've recently bought an iPad.

i'd like to pick up the video cable kit for it so i can use it do to at least some of the video watching on TVs like i did with my iBook, but is it possible to control the video/audio playback on the iPad via an iPod touch as a remote control?

iphone,"Ok, I've got all the issues with my phone... and I'm not lying.","I got my phone the day before launch day.  It was awesome, I noticed the bars bouncing up and down, but I was on wifi so I didn't really care at the time.

Then it got bad fast.  I would be out with my wife, and I would try to show her something, but by the time I typed in the url and showed her the phone I would have ""no service"".  the only to get it to work after that was to lay it flat on the table then press reload.  I've bought a case since then, and it's absolutely necessary for it to work.

Then in certain rooms and lighting the pictures come out super yellow.  I compared it with the camera from my 3g, and they color is just fine in those (ios4).

Now the proximity sensor.  I'd say one out every 3 phone calls my phone will be muted by my cheek. 

Now, I refuse to return my phone because....well I don't like android.  I like the iPhone.

I've read that a large number of people on this subreddit do NOT suffer from this issue.

So if this is the case, why won't apple let me swap it out?  If I've got a defective phone and I can easily reproduce the issues, just let me get a new working phone.  

I don't think I'm out of line here.

I've got a new appt with Apple on Saturday.  I hope they'll let me swap it out now.

apple,"In case anyone didn't already know: 1) You can get applecare refunded (pro-rated), and 2) You can buy the same applecare coverage on eBay for significantly less than the Apple store.","If you've bought applecare on a computer within the last year, you should be able to get a near full refund (minus a small administrative fee - it was $10 for me), since the ""purchased"" applecare only covers years 2 and 3 of ownership. Then go on eBay (or Amazon) and re-buy applecare for significantly less. (edit: As [synthetase](http://www.reddit.com/user/synthetase) points out, ""**do not return applecare and try to [re]buy it after the first year**."" You won't be allowed to re-signup.)


Yes, I have called and received a refund before. 1 phone call to applecare, they transfer you to the ""applecare administration department"", and a few weeks later you get a check in the mail. And yes, I buy all my applecare from eBay now. They just need the code to register you for applecare; it doesn't matter where you purchased it. I've had [no trouble](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ctkug/in_case_anyone_didnt_already_know_1_you_can_get/c0v5s67) when going in to get service on machines that have applecare purchased from eBay vendors.


**You can verify what I'm saying by checking the applecare fine print, and calling in to ask before you actually do anything.** The applecare rep will tell you the same thing. (Pro rated refund minus administrative fee, ok to rebuy warranty later, it doesn't matter where you purchased the applecare warranty.)


$350 for applecare on a 15"" macbook pro at apple store, [$260](http://www.amazon.com/AppleCare-Protection-Plan-MC247LL-Computers/dp/B002VWK4RY/ref=sr_1_2?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1280111274&amp;sr=1-2) ""ships from and sold by Amazon.com"", $135 on eBay. My god, what a racket...


*/loyal (but cheap) mac user*


*edit: If you're gonna buy applecare from eBay, spring for extra couple of bucks and **buy from a reputable vendor who will physically mail you the sealed applecare box** ([just in case](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ctkug/in_case_anyone_didnt_already_know_1_you_can_get/c0v5tdh)). Many of the ""will email code"" vendors will mail you the box for the price of shipping + a few bucks. You only need to ask nicely before buying.*


*edit2: Even [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_p_6_1?rh=k:applecare,p_76:1,n:172282,p_6:ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;bbn=172282&amp;keywords=applecare&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1280111242&amp;rnid=303116011) is cheaper than apple retail (by 15-25%, plus no tax for most), for those who distrust the eBay route. The ones in this link ""ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" and are not 3rd party listings. The smaller price difference means it may not be worth the hassle for people who already have applecare to cancel and re-buy, but for people who haven't purchased applecare yet this is a good and zero risk alternative. There really isn't a good reason to pay more at the Apple store for the exact same product.*

apple,"/r/apple, help me! My MBP crashed and now it's running poorly","First of all, I know how many posts like this there are, so I appreciate you looking in to read. Sincerely.

Okay, down to business. Basically, I shut my MBP, 15"", newest model, down after it froze. I did the emergency shut down, holding the power button down. I tried to start it up the next morning, got stuck at the grey loading screen with the little circle loader going on forever. I totally panicked, rebooted to boot from my os x install disc. I ran the disk utility tools, it verified the disk and permissions, and repaired the disk, I'm not sure if it repaired the permissions or not. Regardless, i tried a clean install, it didn't go through. I reinstalled from a prior backup. Now I'm running from a June 27 backup, reinstalling my apps, etc. (PS, if anyone ever loses their music but still has it on their ipod, try Senuti. It's like 18 bucks but it brings the entire library back within minutes.) So, now it stays on the grey loading screen for like 3 or 4 minutes, then boots up. It's really slow, my itunes keeps skipping, videos will freeze then replay, etc. What can I do to test it? I'm currently backing it up again just to make sure, but I haven't had my mac for long enough to know what to do. Any help would be seriously appreciated, I would prefer to avoid a trip to the genius bar. Last time I was there, they estimated a repair a couple hundred dollars out of my price range...

- - - - - - -
Hi everyone,

I've been eagerly waiting for this update to be approved.  I had to exclude some of the features I had planned for this release so that I can push a critical fix through to you guys.  There was a **crash-on-launch** issue when using WIFI on some phones, and this update should fix that up for you.

Now for the good stuff.

** Search **

Alien Blue now has integrated search that uses Reddit's **NEW** search engine.  This allows you to search within subreddits, all reddits, and re-order search results by Relevance, Top and New.  The ability to save your searches is also on the roadmap.

** Retina Update **

I've bumped all of the glyphs to high resolution for iPhone 4 users.  I may have missed one or two, so please be sure to drop me an email (support@alienblue.org) or send me a PM if you spot a blurry one.

** Other Improvements **

* Marks **Visited** Links (enabled by default - can be de-activated from Settings)
* New Option : Show Domain Names on Post List (disabled by default - can be activated from Settings)
* Saving state on exit is now available for all non-pro users also.
(Applicable to 3.x users that don't have native iOS4 Backgrounding)
* Fixed views and buttons fading in and out or flashing when switching tabs
* Rounded thumbnails
* Fixed broken Imgur links to albums
* Lots of other minor bugs

Please don't be disappointed if some of your requests aren't on this release, they're on their way.  Knowing that some people couldn't launch Alien Blue at all, I really needed to get this update out with haste.

If time permits, I would really appreciate any reviews you can leave for [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/app/alien-blue-unofficial-reddit/id370144106?mt=8#).

iphone,"I have an idea for an iPhone app, and no experience programming (nor do I have the desire to learn). How do I go about making this a reality?","I have an idea for an iPhone app that developed from an interactive audio project at school. I don't really want to talk about the idea itself, as there are no other applications like it. I spoke to my instructor about this, and he got real excited and also thinks its a great idea.

So I have the idea the program layout figured out, but how do I go about actually making this into an app?

I dont know anything about programming, and this program I think would be fairly complex, so creating it myself is not an option. I am a poor college student, and can't really afford to pay someone very much, if anything.

apple,Helpful tips for getting a mac ready for re-sale or making a clean image. AKA How to reset Setup Assistant and re-run the initial setup for a mac.,"This hint will probably be most useful for folks who configure machines for a living, but if you're selling or giving away your machine, or just troubleshooting login issues, it may come in handy. Here are the Terminal commands to delete a temporary (or lone) account in single-user mode on Leopard (in the following commands, replace username with whatever account short name you've created). Note that this must all be done in single user mode (hold Command-S during boot). 

Steps that worked for me:

1) Boot mac into single user mode by holding down Command-s at startup.

2)

    $ mount -uw /
    $ rm -R /Users/USERNAME/

3)

    $ /bin/launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist &amp;
    $ dscl . -delete /Users/USERNAME

4)
    $ rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone

5)

    $ exit

6) That's it!

Other notes about Setup Assistant that have been covered elsewhere but are useful to know:
You can quit the Setup Assistant by pressing Command-q before sending your information to Apple.

You can also shutdown from the Setup Assistant by pressing Command-q.

You can access the original video and audio (separate files) from the intro to Mac OS video by entering the following text into a terminal window:

    $ cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Setup\ Assistant.app/Contents/Resources/TransitionSection.bundle/Contents/Resources/
    $ open intro.mov
    $ open intro-sound.mp3

iphone,"Taking this game from idea to App Store cost me two years of my life, gave me my first grey hairs, and caused my personal bankruptcy. Finally it's done. And it was probably worth it.","The game is called Wristbreaker. I got the idea during the summer of 2008. At the time the iPhone was the *only* platform where this idea was even possible.

**Here's a video of how the game looks:** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R8VmTVzXpc

**Here's a link to the free version:** http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wristbreaker-lite/id382021970?mt=8

(Please excuse the quality of the video. I didn't make it. I know it's shit.)

Yes, it's basically like Tetris, but you *rotate the phone around the piece.*

Took me about a year to convince someone to fund it and get a team together. Mind you, it was a team of young amateurs, located in Estonia. And the investors I found were quite, er, *battle-hardened...*

Our initial estimate for getting the game done was ""roughly 1 month"". And we actually had 90% of it finished in a month. The *other 90%* then took about a year to complete.

There was a ton of infighting between different parties involved in the project and due to some legal and otherwise maneuvering I ended up personally bankrupt around Christmas 2009 and was forced to leave the company where we were building Wristbreaker.

It's been a fairly horrible two years, bringing this game from idea to App Store, but I think it was worth it. I can pretty safely say that it's still one of the most unique games you've ever seen so far.

Everyone who's tried it has gotten absolutely addicted to it. (The video above absolutely does not do the game any justice.)

The sales, however, have been quite bad :(

Fellow redditors, I urge you to try the free version. And please comment below what you think of it.

**Update:** Wow! Your response has been truly phenomenal! And thank you for the many intelligent questions. It's been fun replying to them all. Kinda feels like an AMA :)

I'd like to thank you, guys and girls of reddit, for continuing to be the best online community ever. No other place makes me feel quite as warm and fuzzy on the inside as this.

Unfortunately it's 3 AM here and I need some sleep. Feel free to continue posting any questions you might have regarding the game or the development process or anything, really. I'll get back to replying to them in the morning :)

**Update:** Back! Many thanks to everyone who has tried the game!",95,123,2010-07-30,AAPL,0.05089126527309418,0.9127103686332703,0.03639831021428108
apple,"Hey guys, I have an Automator workflow that will let you sync two iTunes libraries from different computers on the same network. Hope someone finds it useful.","Actually I just followed a tutorial from MacOSXHints. Which I can't find the link to unfortunately. But I am making the whole process short by providing the actual Automator file and simple step instructions.

0. BACKUP YOUR MUSIC FOLDER. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS IN CASE THINGS FUCK UP.

1. Enable the File Sharing from System Preferences on your remote computer. (Make sure the Home folder is being shared and change the computer name into something simple like John_MacMini

2. Then download the workflow from here: [Download](http://cl.ly/5f4adb39fa1d3c429c93) and open it

3. Change the address here [server](http://cl.ly/bb7da65d4d9bfd4fdf02) to your remote Home address (i.e. if your remote computer has a user called 'John' and the computer is called John_MacMini then the address should read as afp://User:Pass@John_MacMini.local/John

4. In the 'Run Shell Script' section of the Automator workflow change the following [address](http://cl.ly/2d96e0e33e0e43c3a28e) to where your Music folder is in your remote computer (i.e. if your user name on the other computer is John then the address should be /Volumes/John/Music)

5. Thats it save the script as an application and run it and it will sync everything so both folders will be identical (i.e. remove anything that is not on the source and add everything that isn't)",33,82,2010-07-30,AAPL,0.044580016285181046,0.9327738881111145,0.022646062076091766
