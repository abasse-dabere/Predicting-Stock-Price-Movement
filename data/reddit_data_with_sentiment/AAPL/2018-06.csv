apple,I found who stole my iPhone using a personal data request from Apple,"I've made a couple of data requests to Apple over the last couple of weeks, learning more about how they respond to these. The dump of data I got this morning included AppleCare records showing that someone had rocked up at an Apple Store and paid for a repair job *on my stolen phone*. In order to do so, they had to leave a bunch of their own details with Apple.

Pretty cool that a stolen phone from two years back can reappear like this; it seems likely I'll be able to get a handle on who took it, or at least who has it now.

I wonder, should people who steal phones have to consent to Apple storing their data?

It's unclear where this came from, but he's the one who dug into the iOS 11 GM when it leaked before the keynote last year and discovered Animoji and a lot of details about Face ID, so this is probably legit.

Edit: [Follow-up tweet](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1002903470939230208):

&gt; As usual, the spoilers came from within: Apple posted a 30-second preview video of Xcode on 10.14 to the Xcode MAS store page API (which, as videos aren't supported on the MAS, 'should' have been hidden.

iphone,"3 years on, the 6S is still the best phone I‚Äôve ever owned.","Anybody that knows me irl would consider me to be very ADD when it comes to tech. I always sell my devices to upgrade to the latest and greatest. Between 2006 and 2015 when I got the 6S, I had 12 phones - an average of one every 9 months. 

But honestly, I haven‚Äôt had a reason to upgrade from the 6S. I had always heard about how long iPhones were supported (for better or worse) but I never thought after 3 years I‚Äôd have a phone on the latest OS performing exactly the same as the day I got it.  Even getting one years worth of updates is pushing it in the majority of the Android world. I had a few month low point after iOS 11 was released where I was getting awful lags, but that is long gone now. 

No wonder Apple still sells the 6S and SE. This hardware seems to be rock solid futureproof.

apple,WWDC Insight: How dropped frames are finally being fixed in iOS 12,"While for many of us WWDC may feel like it's over, the keynote is only the simplified consumer focused overview of the new software. The actual meat and potatoes comes from the many dozens of dev sessions (like mini keynotes) where Apple developers and engineers will dive deep into the specific low level changes that make the new software tick. 

---------------------

I wanted to focus on one that took place yesterday titled ""[Session 202: What's New in Cocoa Touch](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/)"". Cocoa Touch is the low level framework that controls all touch events and their subsequent UI response/animation throughout iOS. Most notably: scrolling. After reading that iOS 12 was supposed to feature ""smoother animation and scrolling"" on the info page from Apple's website, I was interested to hear what the actual engineers had to say about this. In this session, Josh Shaffer confirmed that Apple has gone through a **full audit** of all native Apple apps within iOS and used those as a testing ground to profile for any areas the core animation frameworks are experiencing bugs and bottlenecks. 



I'm pleased to report that this session **directly** targeted three major reasons that we've had persistent frame drops throughout iOS despite the exponentially more powerful hardware we get year over year. This has been going on for many years and described in all kinds of ways from countless users on this sub: ""hitching"", ""jank"", ""stutter"", ""judder"", etc. Regardless of verbiage, iOS has been failing to maintain 60FPS consistently during scrolling since ~iOS 7, and it sounds like iOS 12 is finally **finally** addressing this. These improvements will not only benefit the native apps, but should also extend to improving the scrolling/animation performance of third party apps as well without any extra work on the developer's part. Should make a lot of users here ([especially Chris Pirillo!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDCVavaqDJCFjcQxZsL6InzHxPEYWwMMMh9QtfRGjbY/edit)) quite happy.

------------------------------


I'm going to do my best to summarize the three major fixes below, but the video linked above is definitely the best way to get a full understanding of what's changing if you're interested. I've grabbed the slides from the presentation and placed them throughout the explanations where appropriate to help visualize what's being discussed. (the little comments in white are my own) Without further ado: 

1.	**An oversight within the [Cell Pre-fetch API](https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/boost-smooth-scrolling-with-ios-10-pre-fetching-api-818c25cd9c5d) causing dropped frames has been fixed**. This was an API introduced in iOS 10 intended to help solve frame drops, particularly those that were the result of [loading heavy data within an upcoming cell during a scroll](https://i.imgur.com/sTNRcAF.png). The idea was that you could pre-load the data (say, a large image coming up before it's made it to the screen upon scroll) in the background so by the time the cell is on screen, the data is already loaded and the CPU performance of the active scrolling thread remains unaffected. While this works much of the time and did in fact reduce dropped frames, Apple has identified a bug in the implementation. Instead of running the pre-fetch *after* the current cell is finished loading and visible on screen, sometimes the pre-fetch will incorrectly start loading future data at the *same time* as the current cell was already loading in on screen! This meant that the CPU was handling not only the scroll, but [also the pre-fetch for future data while there was already data in the process of loading in](https://i.imgur.com/5fEYNV8.png). Essentially, the pre-fetch was a bit ""too ambitious"" and would fetch too early requiring the CPU to load *two* large elements concurrently, often causing frames to drop due to the exact kind of spike in CPU usage this API was designed to reduce. In iOS 12, they [have adjusted the pre-fetch API so it now loads more intelligently](https://i.imgur.com/9a1OVsN.png), vastly reducing the chance that it will try to fetch data too early and prevent a slam to the CPU. 

2.	**Apple has identified and corrected an issue in the CPU performance controller causing dropped frames even when there was very little background load.** This one is an even bigger win for performance in iOS 12. Previously, when an app would alert the system that there was a big load coming up during a scroll and it needed more CPU performance, [the CPU was quite slow to respond and increase its clock speed.](https://i.imgur.com/EXSDvax.png) In fact, by the time the CPU was at a higher speed state, it was often too late and the frame was already dropped. This has been fixed, and is actually what Craig was referring to at the main keynote. Essentially, when an app needs more CPU performance to prevent a frame drop, [the CPU will now respond instantly and rocket right up to its high clock speeds](https://i.imgur.com/MxCxlLZ.png), and more quickly drop back down to idle. (all mobile CPUs idle as often as possible to maintain battery life, only going to max speed when required)

3.	**The auto-layout framework has been heavily optimized to substantially increase performance.** Auto-layout is what allowed Apple to begin targeting different screen sizes and shapes in iOS. It controls how most UI elements, text, and content are laid out on the display by automatically controlling spacing for the many different iDevice screen sizes, without requiring the developer to completely redesign an app to support a new screen size. It has been in active use since iOS 8 when the iPhones went big. As it turns out, [Apple discovered that the performance impact of the Auto-layout framework](https://i.imgur.com/A2uqXD7.png) was actually [scaling at an exponential rate with iOS 11](https://i.imgur.com/qFCWP1Y.png) (and quite likely, iOS 8/9/10) so the performance penalty for using it in more complex ways was quite severe. In iOS 12, they have gone through and heavily optimized the auto-layout framework so the performance impact of it is far more linear, which should free up the CPU and GPU substantially when rendering apps. 


-----------
These are the three primary improvements and fixes for avoiding dropped frames introduced in iOS 12. Josh mentions that there are even more than this, but these are the three that have brought the largest increase in scrolling performance and have dramatically reduced frame drops on old and new devices alike. Chances are the work described above is still on-going so the beta builds of iOS 12 may not reflect the full improvement we can expect, but hopefully when we're installing the final build of iOS 12 this September we can finally see a return to the locked 60FPS experience (and now 120FPS on iPad Pros) we once had in the early days of iOS. 

----------------------

**EDIT:** I feel inclined to tack on a disclaimer. I'm writing this to inform the wider community that Apple is detailing their efforts to smooth out animation in iOS 12, but I don't work for Apple and I don't make any guarantee that the frame drops WILL be fixed. I'm just acting as a messenger here. 

These are improvements that are in active development for iOS 12, and they are making the promise that it will help massively reduce frame drops in both first party and third party apps. As the only iOS 12 we have access to today is very early beta software, we cannot expect the current version to have these improvements fully implemented. We must reserve judgement on whether these endeavors were successful in solving the problem, or not, only when we have our hands on the final version of iOS 12. 

They've spent a year focusing a majority of engineering on optimizing low level frameworks to fix this and many other issues (I can do another write-up if anyone is interested, the new session videos dropped tonight). Quite frankly, if iOS 12 ships and the issue isn't solved/massively reduced on modern hardware (A9 and forward)... *I think we can safely abandon all hope that it ever will be.*

EDIT 2: Made some clarifications regarding the first point on pre-fetch. 

EDIT 3: I‚Äôve never had the honor of making the fabled ‚ÄúThanks for the gold!‚Äù edit for myself. Some said it was always a long shot, some said I just wasn‚Äôt born for gold.  But I‚Äôve made it, here I am!  Thanks for the gold!!",253,2944,2018-06-07,AAPL,0.08774011209607124,0.8718826472759247,0.04037723410874605
apple,MKBHD and his tendency to state incorrect facts,"Edit: I would like to do a little post-discussion explosion additions here. In all honesty I went into this expecting a small group of comments and this post to disappear after a small amount of time. Because of this, my phrasing and terminology were much more lax than what I would have used if I knew this post would cause such a rift. I agree my post sounds a bit aggressive and some people have called me out for back tracking, which is fine I see what they‚Äôre saying, but essentially my reply to Marques is closer to what my feelings are. Were this a conversation between him and I, it would have been very casual and superficial. I genuinely feel bad that I likely came off as a bit insulting and appeared to be gas-lit and looking for validation. No one is perfect and that‚Äôs fine this was just something I had though about today. Sorry dude I meant no harm.  




Over the past few years, I have watched MKBHD videos a lot. Throughout that time, I‚Äôve noticed a very frequent occurrences of him (seemingly) blatantly missing details about things he has talked about or simply giving incorrect information in almost every video focused on Apple products. 


In his most recent video of the [Top 5 iOS 12 Features ](https://youtu.be/RROs-zCrSko), he was flat out wrong about multiple things he had mentioned in the video. As an example, when he mentioned the addition of grouped notifications, he stated that while it was a nice feature, he wished Apple would implement a way to complete an action on a notification without entering the app. Anyone who has used iOS at all knows full well that we have had that ability for years yet he seems to have somehow not known about the actions apps present when you 3D Touch them. He said he hoped they would add it, but apparently it seems like it would be years from now, which is weird and absurd.


From his HomePod review video, he also stated that he thought it was very stupid that the HomePod can only be chosen as an output on the iPhone and NOT the Mac, Apple TV, or anything else. He went as far to say something along the lines of ‚Äúclassic Apple‚Äù which of course gave a field day to those in the comment section who enjoy cementing their distaste for Apple and their products. 


I think he is a good YouTube personality and his videos are always of excellent visual quality, but is quite baffling to me how little effort he puts into fact checking or (it seems) even doing a quick look into the settings/googling something he decided to put into the video. I currently chill in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone and a Mac, but I like android a lot and keep up with that side of the fence just as much as Apple‚Äôs. It‚Äôs somewhat frustrating to watch a video of his where he states incorrect facts more than once in some videos with no history or intention of ensuring what he‚Äôs saying is true/back tracking to correct misinformation.

apple,"When macOS Mojave comes out, do us a favor: use Safari.","As many of you may have heard, [Apple is making a big push to making Safari a more powerful privacy tool](https://www.fastcompany.com/40581691/all-the-people-apple-just-pissed-off-to-better-protect-your-privacy) by anonymizing your data as much as possible. Basically, they're restricting what information about your machine companies can see by only allowing Safari to show them the most bare-bones basic info about your Mac. It's like the difference between a report describing ""a dark, glossy blue Ford Fusion with tinted windows and numberplate *555-LOL*,"" and ""a dark Ford sedan."" It won't stop companies from tracking you, or trying to at least, but it will make it harder to personally identify you in particular.

I watched the WWDC keynote, but it didn't really click until today that Mojave's Safari is [basically implementing something similar to TOR-style anonymizing](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview), minus the triple-encrypted routing to a separate node. The biggest thing about TOR's effectiveness (and the reason it was made public): [the more people that use it, the more that everyone using it blends in](https://youtu.be/mUP0tx7Ib2w?t=2m18s). Same case with Safari's ad-fingerprint disabling, the more people who use it, the more everyone using it blends in, because the more the people using it, the more they look like everyone else using it.

So Mac users, please do us a favour, when Mojave is released, switch to Safari if you haven't already. For your sake and that of everyone else using it.

TL;DR: Safari's ad-tracking disabling works better when more people use it, so if you're on macOS Majave, you can help make Safari's ad-tracking disabling more effective just by using Safari.

apple,iCloud should offer Time Machine in the cloud and end-to-end encryption for storage and backup,"Currently Time Machine only works with an external hard drive or a local time capsule, NAS or similar. There is no possibility to use an external, off-site server, let alone iCloud. For the iOS devices however we have the possibilities of iTunes sync and iCloud backup. I don‚Äôt see why we shouldn‚Äôt have a similar option for macOS backups. It would be a great selling point for Apple to offer great backups out-of-the-box with a backup on a local device of yours, such as a time capsule, and an off-site backup in the iCloud.

Further, to make iCloud more attractive, unique and ultimately more secure against data breaches, the iCloud storage and backups put there should be truly end-to-end encrypted such that not even Apple could access the data. Currently this is only the case for a small amount of data, such as keychain elements, home data, payment data and iMessage in the cloud (if you do not perform iCloud backups). Of course, not backing up the keys used to encrypt your data runs a risk of permanently losing access to your backups and data, which is a problem I have no good solution to propose for. I am however sure Apple could come up with a clever way to solve this.

apple,The changes to iOS‚Äô ‚Äòfluidity‚Äô in iOS12 are amazing.,"Being able to interact with the OS even when apps are closing or launching is great and really makes the phone feel way faster than it was on iOS 11. 

Some neat things I‚Äôve noticed/read about:

You can launch an app and start scrolling within the app even before it fills the screen. 
You can launch an app and then dismiss it even before the app has fully opened. 
You can close and app and instantly open another app from the home screen before the closing animation has finished, if you do it quick enough you can even see the closing animation and opening animation of each app playing at the same time. 
If you exit an app to a folder, you can exit the folder instantly without having to wait for the closing animation to finish. 
You can close an app an instantly start swiping on the home screen (although I think this may have been in iOS 11)",326,1642,2018-06-10,AAPL,0.02468343824148178,0.9081127643585205,0.06720385700464249

iphone,Apple should introduce a free-trial period for iOS games,"Basically, you get a free-trial where you can try premium games/apps for a certain period set by the developers e.g. 1 day, 3 days or 1 week. 

Let's face it - people aren't willing to spend money on premium games. And I can understand why, as I've regretted spending money on premium games because it was different to what I expected, or I just didn't like it. 

Introducing a free-trial period would support premium games more as it would allow iOS users to know if the game is worth spending money on. 

It's a shame that iOS is littered with poor quality F2P games that have in-app purchases, a P2W mechanism, or an energy/time system. 

The loot-box rule (the one where new apps must now disclose odds of loot boxes) they introduced last year was a step in the right direction for iOS gaming.

mac,"PSA: Please, please, please enable your firmware passwords!","Recently had my MacBook Pro stolen ‚Äî left alone in a uni library for 5 mins whilst I went to the loo, though it'd be OK but alas. Anyway, that's stupidity on my behalf.

Thing is: I had Find My Mac enabled. I got back 5 mins later to a laptop that was missing, so had a look for it. Nothing registered. 30 mins later and my device didn't show in FMM ‚Äî weird.

Looking into this, it seems likely the thief knew what they were doing. You can boot into recovery, clear the NVRAM (single line in terminal is all it takes) and that will prevent your Mac from communicating with Apples servers with regards to FMM. If they then wipe the hard drive, reinstall Mac OS and quickly login to iCloud with their own account, it will completely overwrite your ownership in iCloud. You won't be able to trace the Mac, or do anything to do. Apple won't help.

At this point you're at the mercy of law enforcement finding it and matching a serial number - a very unlikely scenario.

---

Lesson? ENABLE YOUR FIRMWARE PASSWORDS! If you do this in recovery, thieves can't wipe the HDD meaning even if NVRAM is cleared, the device is useless to them. If they don't, they can't wipe it either so eventually the Mac will ping when it connects to internet somewhere and you can track the device.

It's too late for me, but don't make the same errors. Don't leave your device unattended at all, ever. Enable firmware passwords. Enable find my Mac. Make a note of your serial number.

--

On a side note: I'm gutted that Apple doesn't have a solution whereby the serial number alone can trigger alerts when the device is reported as stolen.

apple,AirPods: battery degradation update after 18 months,"Thought this would be helpful for anyone currently using, or considering buying AirPods.

Background:

I received my AirPods on December 20th 2016 after preordering on Day 1. In early April 2017, I got my right AirPod replaced due to unresponsive sensors. I am a heavy AirPods user. For the past 18 months, I have used them anywhere from 2-8 hours every day for: listening to music/podcasts and phone calls. I use them exclusively in the gym, and have completely drained the batteries many times during long conference calls.

Degradation after 18 months:

- AirPods (together) drain about 25% per hour while listening to music and podcasts. I have noticed they drain slightly faster when the volume is louder. 
- The left AirPod (original) drains about 65% per hour on phone calls. This drains noticeably faster (as much as 5-10% more per hour) if I am speaking through the mic for most of the call.
- The right AirPod (replaced after 4 months) drains about 55% per hour on phone calls. I don't notice this one draining much when I'm speaking a lot.

So taking all of the above data into consideration, one can conclude that my AirPods will last around 4 hours per charge on music, and about 92 minutes per charge on phone calls (more if I manage both AirPods during calls). We're looking at about 20-25% degradation after 18 months of heavy use. 

My conclusion? This is about what I expected. I continue to use and enjoy my AirPods every day. So well done, Apple.",97,443,2018-06-14,AAPL,0.05112605169415474,0.9160740375518799,0.03279991075396538

iphone,This iPhone 150mb limit is fucking stupid,"We seriously need to look at this feature and get the attention of Apple on this. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a more useless feature ever. It‚Äôs a senseless limitation for the sake of it. Maybe this was useful for like 2000-2004 when 3G was all we could get and all data plans had like a 1G limit. This is 2018 where mobile carriers are nearly putting out more MBS then our land line cable companies. Seriously, I got 4 different explanations about how it‚Äôs there to keep me from going over my limit... Well that‚Äôs obsolete because unlimited data plans. The other explanation I got was because it was faster... that‚Äôs not right because I get 100mbs on cellular and only 25mbs on my own in home WiFi. Third was, It‚Äôs so that it doesn‚Äôt interrupt the downloads.. wrong again you can manually do that ALL you want by simply pausing the download or activating airplane mode. The fourth one was because someone said the network towers couldn‚Äôt handle it and wrong again because android phones do this with ZERO problems. This seems like a ploy by Apple to push internet sales. Further more is just flat out stupid and has arguably ZERO use. Somebody needs to say something to Apple. I have, I know you guys aren‚Äôt a personal army, not begging anyone to be one. Just saying this is extremely stupid. 

Edit: here is the Apple feed back Incase you guys want to submit without having to dig for it.

After 16 weeks because no one came forward and again it was never reported lost or stolen they let my girlfriend keep it.

Weirdly enough there's no contacts, texts or call logs and only a 5 second clip of a spongebob episode on it so I assume it belonged to a small child or something

mac,"After using both for a bit, macOS feels much more modern than Windows 10","Lately Apple has been (very deservedly) criticised of letting macOS rot a bit, in terms of user facing features. Sierra was a relatively minor update, and High Sierra focused more on frameworks and behind-the-scenes tech that didn't impact day-to-day activities much.

Because of this and other compatibility reasons, I started doing some of my work on Windows 10. I do have to agree the newest parts of Windows 10's UI are nice and really rival macOS.

However, I eventually abandoned using W10 altogether.

Here are just a bunch of things that macOS handles without issue but trip up W10:

**Deleting directories with many files.**

I work on very large Github projects, some with over 100+ Node dependencies, resulting in folders that are tens of thousands of files in size.

On Windows, trying to move this folder to the Recycle Bin takes ages, with Explorer slowly crunching through each file before it gets moved. Then it takes even longer when you actually try to empty the Recycle Bin.

macOS handles moving this directory to the Trash literally instantly. Emptying the Trash does take a bit longer, but nowhere near as long as Explorer takes.

**The Finder is so much more advanced than Explorer. **

Quick Look (especially on the Mojave beta) is really capable in that it can preview almost any file out of the box (pictures, videos, JSON, etc), quickly markup stuff and can be added to using plugins. Mojave's quick actions are really sweet too.
The new Finder dark mode looks absolutely sick too, much better than Explorer's white text on complete black.

**PDF support**

I find it really common that I have to combine PDFs, split PDFs, add pages/images to PDFs, re-arrange PDFs, copy pages between PDFs, bookmark a page in a PDF, etc. All this can be done stupidly easily in Preview, and it handles it flawlessly. No need to upload it to some dodgy web service. Preview has no issue handling 600+ pages documents either. Scrolls through them super smoothly.

Edge is good at viewing and marking up PDFs... that's about it.

**Just plain shutting up**

W10's notifications just don't stop...

""Activate Cortana!!!""

""Download Edge for iOS!!!""

""Download Continue on PC for iOS!!!""

""Download Cortana for iOS!!!""

""Windows Defender found no issues!!!""

""Can we pleeeeeease restart to update???""

""We've pinned Candy Crush to the start menu again!!!""

macOS just shuts up. The only warning it ever gives me is a low battery alert.

**Crash Protection**

I know this is an odd topic, but both macOS and Windows 10 have stuffed up before.

I installed the 1709 feature update, and that left my W10 partition in a constant BSOD reboot loop. Only way to fix it was to nuke the partition and re-install (I spent a good amount of time trying to salvage it because I had stuff set up the way I wanted).

On macOS, I ended up breaking the OS when I tried to jump from the Public Beta -&gt; Stable. It still booted, but the update failed to install and the App Store no longer worked. Quick reboot into Internet Recovery, in-place reinstall of the OS, and everything was up to date and completely working again. All my files and Homebrew packages were untouched.

Also, if you force shutdown macOS while you have a bunch of unsaved stuff open, it'll most likely still be there the next time you log in. Some W10 apps like Office do try and recover your stuff, but most apps do not üòí.

If you're running an EFI update and manage to get a corrupt BootROM because the update was interrupted in some way, macOS will restore a working copy. I suspect this is a hardware feature though, as some business PCs have it too. The PCs I work on don't do this though, so I'm terrified every time I have to update the firmware.

apple,"Slide for Reddit is now in Beta Testing, and we need your help revolutionizing the Reddit experience on iOS! Introducing the feature-packed, ad-free, open-source, and beautifully designed Reddit app that has been loved on Android since 2015 and has been written from the ground up for the App Store","Hello [r/apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple) users!

My name is Carlos, and I am a university student that has been developing one of the most popular third party Reddit apps on Android, Slide for Reddit, for a little over three years now. In this time, Slide has gained a reputation for being ad-free and open-source, feature-packed, and beautifully designed, and I have spent the last year or so delving into the Apple ecosystem to bring the same features and a fresh, new design to iOS! Slide brings something totally unique to Redditing on iOS devices, and I am extremely excited to announce that Slide iOS is now accepting applications for public Beta Testing on TestFlight! If you are interested in becoming a tester or contributing code to Slide, there is more information about this test at the bottom of the post.

Slide on iOS has been designed from the ground up to be fast and feature packed, with a fresh and *unique* Material Design inspired UI that is simple to use and extremely customizable (thousands of theme and layout combinations). Slide is fully offline-capable, which means you can cache your favorite subreddits and comments for when you are offline, and Slide supports your favorite content sites such as Streamable.com, v.redd.it videos, Imgur albums (for free), and Gfycat.com links, just to name a few.

Slide is also **fully open-source** under an Apache 2 license, with a repository on Github that is actively accepting contributions!

# What makes Slide unique?

For starters, Slide iOS is based off of the design and feature set of Slide on Android ( [r/slideforreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit) ), which has been built over years and has had extensive testing, evolution, and user feedback. This means that you can expect a sizable feature set that feels intuitive to use and learn, and a tried and tested design that has been modified to feel right at home on iOS.

[Here are some promotional images for Slide](https://imgur.com/a/f9kGbHl) that will be featured on the App Store when Slide exits Beta!

Some other features include:

* Make each subreddit unique with its own theme colors and accents, and automatically pull these colors from supported subreddits
* Reply to comments and submissions **inline** without opening a reply window, and upload images anonymously to Imgur straight into to your submissions/comments
* Most feature-rich and easy to use moderation suite on iOS, with support for mod mail, and per-subreddit mod queues
* Many view types including compact mode for dense information display and beautiful card layout for enjoying photos
* Gallery and shadowbox modes give you a new way to view your favorite subreddits
* Extensive data-saving options, with quality modes and WiFi toggle
* Sync your Slide settings between all your iCloud devices
* Theme choices include a beautiful true black AMOLED theme, sepia theme, blue theme, and white theme
* Powerful filter system to block out what you don‚Äôt want to see, including content types (ex. filter gifs from [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all)) and domains
* View and delete your browsing history, or turn off history completely to go incognito
* ‚ÄúCasual‚Äù subscriptions that won‚Äôt show up on your frontpage
* Multi-account support
* Ad-Block in websites using the built-in web view
* Optimized for iPad viewing with configurable columns and popup comment views
* Automatic caching for your morning commute
* Automatic night theme with custom activation hours
* Powerful drafts system
* Multireddit support
* 7 fonts to choose from, and submission titles/comments can have different fonts
* Link url/content type previews to make sure you don't click on anything too risky
* Default post sorting per-subreddit
* User tagging (like RES)
* Lightweight and blazing fast
* Always ad-free and open source
* Much more that you will fall in love with

**If you would like to help beta test Slide for iOS,** [**please fill out this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdv1K2_kLQhLaRrCuF6JIT0dy2VoFIAvtSZYw0WWTuLwWk8yg/viewform)**!** The application will close tomorrow, and 300 testers will be chosen on a first-come-first-serve basis. TestFlight applications will close after this, and I will not be accepting new beta testers until further notice. These testers will also remain active for future Beta builds once Slide is released publicly.

iphone,"Slide for Reddit is now in Beta Testing, and I need your help revolutionizing the Reddit experience on iPhone! Introducing the feature-packed, ad-free, open-source, and beautifully designed Reddit app that has been loved on Android since 2015 and has been written from the ground up for the App Store","Hello r/iphone users!

My name is Carlos, and I am a university student that has been developing one of the most popular third party Reddit apps on Android, Slide for Reddit, for a little over three years now. In this time, Slide has gained a reputation for being ad-free and open-source, feature-packed, and beautifully designed, and I have spent the last year or so delving into the Apple ecosystem to bring the same features and a fresh, new design to iOS! Slide brings something totally unique to Redditing on iOS devices, and I am extremely excited to announce that Slide iOS is now accepting applications for public Beta Testing on TestFlight! If you are interested in becoming a tester or contributing code to Slide, there is more information about this test at the bottom of the post.

Slide on iOS has been designed from the ground up to be fast and feature packed, with a fresh and *unique* Material Design inspired UI that is simple to use and extremely customizable (thousands of theme and layout combinations). Slide is fully offline-capable, which means you can cache your favorite subreddits and comments for when you are offline, and Slide supports your favorite content sites such as Streamable.com, v.redd.it videos, Imgur albums (for free), and Gfycat.com links, just to name a few.

Slide is also **fully open-source** under an Apache 2 license, with a repository on Github that is actively accepting contributions!

# What makes Slide unique?

For starters, Slide iOS is based off of the design and feature set of Slide on Android ( [r/slideforreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit) ), which has been built over years and has had extensive testing, evolution, and user feedback. This means that you can expect a sizable feature set that feels intuitive to use and learn, and a tried and tested design that has been modified to feel right at home on iOS.

[**Here are some promotional images for Slide**](https://imgur.com/a/f9kGbHl) that will be featured on the App Store when Slide exits Beta!

Some other features include:

* Make each subreddit unique with its own theme colors and accents, and automatically pull these colors from supported subreddits
* Reply to comments and submissions **inline** without opening a reply window, and upload images anonymously to Imgur straight into to your submissions/comments
* Most feature-rich and easy to use moderation suite on iOS, with support for mod mail, and per-subreddit mod queues
* Many view types including compact mode for dense information display and beautiful card layout for enjoying photos
* Gallery and shadowbox modes give you a new way to view your favorite subreddits
* Extensive data-saving options, with quality modes and WiFi toggle
* Sync your Slide settings between all your iCloud devices
* Theme choices include a beautiful true black AMOLED theme, sepia theme, blue theme, and white theme
* Powerful filter system to block out what you don‚Äôt want to see, including content types (ex. filter gifs from [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all)) and domains
* View and delete your browsing history, or turn off history completely to go incognito
* ‚ÄúCasual‚Äù subscriptions that won‚Äôt show up on your frontpage
* Multi-account support
* Ad-Block in websites using the built-in web view
* Optimized for iPad viewing with configurable columns and popup comment views
* Automatic caching for your morning commute
* Automatic night theme with custom activation hours
* Powerful drafts system
* Multireddit support
* 7 fonts to choose from, and submission titles/comments can have different fonts
* Link url/content type previews to make sure you don't click on anything too risky
* Default post sorting per-subreddit
* User tagging (like RES)
* Lightweight and blazing fast
* Always ad-free and open source
* Much more that you will fall in love with

TestFlight applications will close after this, and I will not be accepting new beta testers until further notice. These testers will also remain active for future Beta builds once Slide is released publicly.

I don't use Yelp. I don't *like* Yelp. It wouldn't be so bad if the Yelp app was not *required* to view any reviews longer than a short thought, or even view photos, let alone post reviews. To be honest, this is one of the very few reasons why I still use Google Maps over Apple Maps.

Why the decision was made to begin with is almost beyond me - I suspect it was contractual. Here's hoping that contract runs up for the release of iOS 12.

Yes, I have submitted feedback on multiple occasions. I suggest others follow the trend.

#**3D Touch:**

Let's start with the basics, apart from 3D Touching any app for shortcuts, photos for peak and pop, links for a quick preview, or control centre toggles for more options, here are some more uses for it:

* 3D Touch any folder with a badge on it to quickly jump into whatever app has notifications within that folder.
* 3D Touch on any notification (lockscreen or notification centre) to quickly interact with it (if the app supports that).
* 3D Touch on any tab in Safari to quickly preview that tab.  
* 3D Touch on the x button in the notification centre to dismiss all notifications.
* 3D Touch on the keyboard for a cursor to precisely edit your text.
 * Bonus tip: after the initial press, you can press harder again and this will allow you to select text, it goes like this:

          1) Finger on keyboard

          2) Hard press, Taptic feedback tells you you're now moving the cursor

          3) remove most of the pressure without removing your hand

          4) hard press again, it should select the word the cursor is over.

          5) you can either repeat 3 and 4 to select a paragraph, or drag the cursor around to select arbitrary sections.  (credit goes to /u/onegamerboi and /u/Dirty_Socks)


* 3D Touch on the left side of the display for quick access to the app switcher (iPhone 6s,7,8 and their Plus counterparts only).
* You have the ability to change the sensitivity of your 3D Touch by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; 3D Touch. 


#**Home Screen**
* You can move multiple icons if you're on IOS 11 (or higher) by going into wiggle mode, holding down an icon, and with your other hand select other icons by tapping on them.
* Similarly, you can move icons between different pages by holding the icons in one hand, while swiping to a different page with your other hand.
* If you swipe down anywhere on the homescreen you open up spotlight search, nothing new there, but, did you know that you can use it to do a quick calculation, a quick currency conversion, checking the weather and more, and you don't have to type a full sentence to do so, you can just type ""weather"" and it will give you the weather based on your current location, similarily, you could type something like ""350 usd"" and it will automatically convert them to your currency - again, based on your current location, if, you would like to convert to another currency, then you can simply type ""3 usd to cad"" and it will work too.


#**General Tips**
* You can open a recently closed Safari tab by going into tab view, and holding on the + button.
* You can choose to reload a website without content blockers by holding the refresh icon and selecting the option to do so.
* Similarly, you can request a desktop version of the website by holding the same refresh icon and clicking on request desktop site.
* You can close all tabs by holding on the tab view icon in Safari.
* If you have any text copied and you want to look it up, go into Safari and hold the url bar, and you will get a ""Paste and Search"" button, and if the text happens to be a website, the button will be a ""Paste and Go"" one instead.
* If you want to find text on a page in Safari, you can click the url bar, type the word that you want, and select the last option ""On this page"".
* You can search between your open tabs in Safari by clicking on your tab view, tapping the status bar or just scrolling all the way up, and then sliding down.
* You can open a link in the background in Safari by tapping it with two fingers. (credit goes to /u/randomyzee)
* Ever had trouble opening control centre when you have a keyboard open? The solution is simple, simply pull up and hold from the bottom of the screen and voila.
* Do you have multiple Wifi networks and your device is always connecting to the wrong one? You can prevent this from happening by going into Settings &gt; Wifi, once there, tap the blue ""i"" next to the network that you DON'T want your device automatically connecting to, and turn off ""Auto-Join"".
* If you're on a device other than the iPhone X and still wondering how to get notifications to only show up once you unlock the device, you can do so by going into Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Show Previews and then select the option that says ""When Unlocked"", now, notifications content will only be viewable by you, by simply resting your finger on your Touch ID sensor.
* On IOS 11, you can enable Type to Siri by going into Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Siri and then enable Type to Siri.
* If you use iMovie on your device and would like to export 60 fps videos, you can enable this by going to Settings then scrolling all the way down until you see iMovie, tap it and then from there you can enable 60 fps exports.
* I only found out about this a few days ago, but if you would like to make the colors on your device pop more (I know I know Apple calibrates their devices to be color accurate, but it's still nice to have as an option), to do so, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display Accomodations &gt; Color Filters, once there, enable Color Filters, and choose ""Blue/Yellow Filter"", don't forget to change your intensity settings at the very bottom, I find that anywhere from 5-15% is about perfect for me, personal preference.
* Ever handed your phone to someone to show them a picture and then they suddenly feel like they're on Tinder and keep swiping? You can prevent this with ""Guided Access"", but it requires a bit of a setup for the first time. To do so, go into Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Guided Access and turn that on, make sure to set a passcode for it, and enable the switch at the bottom ""Accessibility Shortcuts"", once that's done, leave and open any app, triple tap the home button and now you're in guided access mode, click on Options and disable touch, I hope you're still with me, the initial setup is done! Now whenever you want to hand your phone to someone you can simply triple click the home button to start a guided access session, and triple tap whenever they're done, no more sneaking on your personal pictures.
* If you ever find yourself in need of a bubble level, you have that built into your phone right in the compass app, simply open it and swipe to the right page.
* If you want to delete multiple photos, go into the photos app, click select in the top right corner, and slide your finger across the pictures that you want to delete, you can select a lot of pictures really fast with this method, and then simply hit delete when you're done.


That's it for now, I will update this thread if I remember anything or if any of you guys have a tip that you want to share.
Apologies for any spelling, grammar or formatting errors, English isn't my first language.

Edit: Adding some more tips from the comments and a few that I remembered:

* Shake your phone while typing in order to undo. (credit goes to /u/WallBrown)
* Swipe the number screen in the calculator in order to erase the last digit. (credit goes to /u/kamilman)
* You can swipe down in the updates page in the App Store in order to refresh. (Was added after iOS 11 I believe)
* You can have Siri announce calls by going into Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Announce calls and selecting whatever option you want.",137,1300,2018-06-21,AAPL,0.03664389252662659,0.9327187240123749,0.030637450516223907

apple,"""Simple Space"" high-quality wallpaper and watch face collection for Apple Devices","Let's just step right in.

I made and collected a consistent wallpaper collection for many different Apple Devices. It's called *""Simple Space""*.

[\\""Simple Space\\""](https://i.redd.it/lto0ryjc8i511.png)

All of the wallpapers follow a similar style and they are all related to space. The wallpapers have been OLED-optimised for iPhone X and Apple Watch users in order to maximise battery life. As Mac's don't have OLED displays (yet), the Mac wallpapers are not OLED-optimised and don't use true black colour in order to look better on LCD displays.

The optimised device list includes (This means that the wallpapers will be very ""crisp"" on those devices but may be blurry on others):

*  Apple Watch (All models)
*  iPhone (4.7"", 5.5"", X, X Plus)
*  iMac (Regular, 5K, Pro)
*  MacBook (Air, Pro)

The iPhone wallpaper is the only *""static""* one as there is no slideshow, rotating or dynamic option like there is on the Mac and the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch watch face will rotate and change between different planets each time you wake the screen or tap it, giving it a more *""alive""* feeling. The best I could do with the Mac was to create three wallpapers meant to slideshow. My recommended slideshow timing is 5 minutes.

**Instructions to re-create this watch face for the Apple Watch:**

1. Download the .ZIP file from the link at the end of this post.

2. Move the contents of the *""Apple Watch*"" folder to your iPhone by using AirDrop or sending a message to yourself via Telegram (Make sure to select *""File""* or *""No Compression""* if the Telegram method is used).

3. Go to your Photos app and select the new Apple Watch wallpapers then create a new folder. Recommended name is *""Planets""*

4. Open the *""Watch""* app on your iPhone then go to *""Face Gallery""* and finally *""Photos""*.

5. Select *""Custom""* then navigate to the *""Planets""* album and select all pictures in said album.

6. Select *""Top""* under *""Time Position""* and finish off by setting *""Below Time""* in *""Complications""* to ""*Off""*

7. Press the *""Add""* button and the watch face should show up on your wrist after a short delay.

apple,How Two Factor Authentication Screwed Me,"I got robbed a few nights ago, had my car, phone, wallet, laptop and more stolen from me.  I was held at knifepoint and told to remove the lock on my phone, which I did.  When I got home and was able to work on getting back into the account, I had discovered that the thief had changed my trusted phone number and password.

If I try to go through the forgot password process, it asks me for that new phone number.  I've spoken to Apple numerous times and had several requests sent to an ""engineering"" team including serial numbers of my devices, credit cards used in the past to make purchases, police reports, and my recovery key when I had initially setup two factor authentication.

Every request I send in gets denied, I'm effectively locked out of my 10+ year old Apple Account, with my photo library, iMessage on the cloud, and tons of other sensitive information.

I have a few devices at home still including my Apple Watch and Apple TV but those are useless when it comes to recovering a two factor authenticated account.

After having submitted multiple requests to engineering and having everything denied, I sent an email to Tim yesterday in hopes that he may see it.

Hoping that by posting this that anyone who has gone through this before can share their experience.  This is also a warning to not keep multiple devices that can authorize two factor in the same place.",241,720,2018-06-23,AAPL,0.058278638869524,0.9097921848297119,0.031929172575473785

mac,A quick word about the 2012 MacBook Pro,"Recently I've seen a lot of posts on various forms (not just Reddit) asking ""Is the 2012 MacBook Pro worth buying in 2018/for college/for software development,"" and I'm honestly shocked at some of the feedback/answers that our community is giving. I have read countless responses of:

* ""if they're asking more than $50-100, I wouldn't do it"" 
* ""I mean it'll be 'okay' if all you're planning on doing is browsing and *small productivity*""  
* ""Spec-wise that machine is an obsolete relic compared to the new 2016/2017 models""
* ""Good luck compiling and debugging code""

Seriously? I feel like there's a strange sense of elitism within the community revolving around owning the newest product and blinding proclaiming that any product not made within the last 12 months is automatically obsolete and inferior. As a 2012 MB Pro Retina owner, I can easily debunk all of the above claims. I'm currently a student triple majoring in Applied Mathematics, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science so modeling and software development is my life. So far this machine has been able to handle everything my course work has thrown at me *and then some*. Sure, I've tweaked out the specs on this machine (16GB RAM + 256 GB SSD), but that's just another great feature exclusive to older MB's (being able to upgrade internals). Not to mention, I also don't **hate** typing with my keyboard like many of the new MB owners do. If I'm being honest, I think this machine is one of, if not the best, MB's that Apple has made to date. The only reason I would ever recommend anyone to get a newer model is because eventually, Apple will phase out support/updates for their older machines. I just wish  my beloved MB would just get the love and respect that it deserves &lt;3.

iphone,PSA: Prevent (hopefully) iPhone thieves from making changes to your Apple account (should you happen to be robbed and forced to disclose your passcode),"First of all, I included the word ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù because this is not a foolproof measure (as I will discuss later in the post) so I really hope Apple will do something about it.

So, a few weeks ago I came across a post here where an iPhone was robbed and the owner was forced to disclose his passcode. He later learned that his Apple account was compromised because the robber was able to change his trusted device and thereby change his account password. Then just today the same problem was faced by u/advil0 as posted [here](https://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8tbvtb/how_two_factor_authentication_screwed_me/). This is a serious security issue and it left me wondering what could be done to protect my account from being ‚Äòhacked‚Äô.

The only additional security setting that is currently available to thwart such an incident is to set Restrictions in the Settings:

Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions &gt; Accounts

You set a restrictions PIN (something different from your normal phone passcode) and ‚Äòdont allow changes‚Äô for ‚ÄòAccounts‚Äô. This will effectively prevent anyone who might know your phone passcode from making changes to your Apple Account from that particular phone. To make changes later you will need to disable Restrictions first using the PIN that you had earlier set.

Now it should be noted that thieves might be aware of this trick and may force you to also divulge your Restrictions PIN. But until Apple introduces some counter-measure in their upcoming updates, then we can only hope iPhone thieves are left in the blind regarding this issue.

Hopefully, this may help someone from losing their account should they ever be in a similar situation. 

Also, I tried to post this on r/apple but the moderator bot somehow deletes it for violating *‚ÄúRule 11: No posts or comments relating to buying, selling, trading, giveaways or asking for advice about any of those topics.‚Äù* Go figure.

**TLDR: Set a Restrictions PIN in Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions &gt; Accounts to prevent thieves from changing you Apple account details should you ever be forced to disclose your iPhone passcode.**

**Edit 1:** As highlighted by /u/BruteSentiment I have failed to inform you that you should be careful to not *ever* lose the Restrictions PIN. Take note:

&gt;	IF YOU FORGET YOUR RESTRICTIONS PASSCODE, YOU WILL LOSE ALL DATA ON YOUR DEVICE IF YOU EVER MOVE TO A NEW DEVICE OR NEED TO RESTORE OR REPAIR.

&gt;THIS INCLUDES BACKUPS, BOTH ON ICLOUD AND ON ITUNES.

&gt;THERE ARE NO PASSCODE RECOVERY OPTIONS AVAILABLE, EITHER THROUGH THE WEBSITE, THE STORES, OR CALLING TIM COOK HIMSELF.

apple,iOS 12's performance is phenomenal,"Holy cow I didn't expect this at all. Installing iOS 12 the moment the public beta went live thinking all sorts of things will go wrong, but boy was I wrong. 

The performance is smooth and fast, and so far, after 20 hours with it, I feel like it's just an improved iteration of iOS 11. 

I haven't encountered any problems so far; but a few minor imperfections should be noted: I saw people mentioning Apple Store downloading status is stuck in the *spinning wheel*, and yeah I faced that as well, but it's minor; downloading and updating work just fine. Some lines in apps are distorted; but I guess that's not iOS 12's fault; optimization from app developers would fix the problem. 

Here's to hoping that iOS 12 will be this great for the next 3 months till the final published version is available because I installed it on my main and only phone.

apple,Seamless &amp; Notchless ‚Äî A Collection of iPhone X Wallpapers for Seamless Notch hiding,"Hey Folks!

I recently put together a whole bunch of simple gradient wallpapers that ""hide"" the Notch on your iPhone X! [There was already something like this](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/11/19/minimal-gradient-wallpapers-to-hide-the-iphone-x-notch/), but there were basically two colors, which I didn't really like to be honest so I made around 12 with different colors!

apple,"Apple pay in Poland - 200k in 10 days, Google pay - 300k in 1.5 year","We just got the first numbers for Apple Pay users count. Before I share them, let me introduce you to market shares of iOS and Android in Poland:

**95~% - Android**

**2.32% - iOS** 

Statistics says, that there are 64% users of Smartphones in Poland, which would translate these numbers in:

**22.800.000 Android users**

**556.800 iOS users**

Android pay (now Google pay) has been introduced **somewhere in 2016 (roughly 1.5 year ago), gaining 300k users.**
EDIT: Just for clarity, Google allows for HEC, which means banks can use NFC to support their payments. Counting these in, its 1mln, still much, much lower than how Apple solution adopted!

Apple pay, introduced **10 days ago**, has a reported user count **from 175k to around 200k.**

This is really huge and really shows a HUGE adoption rate for iOS (almost 50%!!) and almost none for Android (1.31%). 

Hopefully Apple will notice us more now, we're still lacking Siri support and official apple store lol
