apple,"Your Move, Mom.","I don't care if a single person reads this, I just feel like I need to type this out. Im going to be 23 in 2 weeks, and Im about to graduate college in December. I still live with my parents, who are both in their late 50s. My mother has arthritis, and its becoming harder and harder for her to move around, see, and she's also deaf in one ear. My mom has been a stay at home mom since I was born (Im the middle child) and all she really does is crossword puzzles and brain teasers. We're the only family that lives here, the rest live two to three hours away and we rarely see them. So my parents really only have each other. No friends, just each other and us kids.

This past December, for Christmas, my father asked me what he should get my mom. I told him he should get her an iPad. The screen would be big enough for her to see, she could read her books and play her games, and finally be able to search the web. My dad bought her an HP laptop the Christmas before that...and she opened it twice. She doesnt even know how to turn it on. We've tried showing her, but it just seemed too daunting.

After about a week with her iPad, my mother is now reading the news every day, watching YouTube videos, sending emails, playing Angry Birds, finding old songs (even ""their"" song) and actually using technology for the first time in her life.

Two days ago, I told my mom to add Words with Friends. Then at school today, I get a popup notification saying that she would like to play a game. It made me happier than anything Ive felt in a while. That my mother, who was so scared of using a computer at one point, is now connected to me no matter where I go.

Thanks Apple. And thanks for reading Reddit.

**Edit:** I just wanted to thank everyone for the outpouring of positive feedback this got. I went and hugged her and whispered ""I love you"" (in her good ear) and she looked at me and smiled...and said ""I love you too...but I just spelt flowers and passed you up.""

I snapped [this](http://i.imgur.com/V9id8.jpg) while she wasn't looking. She's playing Bookworm while waiting for me to hop back on Words With Friends.

**Edit #2:** I just had a long discussion with her and told her how awesome the people of Reddit are and read some of your comments...so if you're up for a game, her Words with Friends User Name is **Charlene73152**! She wont respond to chats (trust me). So feel free to play her if you want, and she says hello!

**Edit #3:** You all just got this guy HUGE brownie points for my bday :) I want to thank **plutoprime** and **DotheDew** for gifting my mom two amazing apps, and now she has access to Reddit! I also want to thank all **40+** people who are currently playing her! I had to turn off her notifications because she was getting them so frequently! You've all brought a lot of joy to my family, so I hope to do the same for this community in the future.

apple,Creating an OS X Administrator's cheat sheet wallpaper.,"This is an idea that I've been throwing around for a while now, and I just haven't had time to get around to it until now. Any of you who are cli-savvy and comfortable in the terminal know of the Linux wallpapers ([like this one](http://i.min.us/iemtv0.png)) that are just loaded with cheats. Well I want to take one of those and add a ton of Mac OS X specific commands to it. Stuff like 'open .' to open the current directory in Finder, and 'opensnoop' to see what files are currently being accessed, pbcopy and pbpaste, there are a ton of them. I want to get everyone's feedback on the list that I've compiled so far and let me know if there is anything else that we should add.

apple,My Mac is running slower and slower. Why? How can I find out why?,"I bought a 2.8 Ghz Intel Core Duo iMac two years ago and, in the last few months, it's just getting slower and slower.  It seems it's taking forever to do its thing.  Chrome doesn't run well any more in it.  It just takes forever sometimes.  Seems like the HD is always chugging on something.

I expect some slowing over time. But anybody know a good way to find out if there are any loose processes out there? Or how to diagnose the problem? Thanks.

** FINAL UPDATE **: I backed up, wiped, and reinstalled my machine. It fixed everything.

**UPDATE**: More examples.  I've been running my Mac for 2 hours today.  I went to the finder and press cmd-shift-N to get a new window.  It took 4.5 seconds.  I then opened the Applications folder.  I don't have a lot of applications aside from the default ones.  It took 5 seconds to list the apps (77 files there).

**UPDATE:** People are asking for a clear example that expresses how stuff slows down.  Things tend to slow down over the course of the day. For example, if I reboot, and start world of warcraft as the only running up, everything run smoothly. However, if, at the end of a day of working or something like 8 hours of uptime, I quit all my apps and run World of Warcraft, shit is sloooooow.  I have to reboot otherwise i really can't run it. 

This is also the case when I have like four apps I typically use open -- Pages, Chrome, Things, and Papers.  At the beginning of the work day, speed is good.  At the end of the day, speed is slow.  I mean app switching is slow. Chrome sometimes gives up on opening web pages (and asks me to kill them), opening MENUS is slow as hell (wait 10 seconds for a menu to open).  

So the feeling is that JUNK just gets clogged in my system over the course of the day.",410,164,2011-02-06,AAPL,0.044605500996112823,0.9253451228141785,0.03004937805235386
apple,Macbook Air 13: first impressions from a Windows user.,"This got kind of long. TLDR; awesome laptop for a first time Mac user.

**Background:**

I had been using an HP Envy 14 for the last 3 months and liked a lot about it- but I definitely didn't need the i5 or optical drive- I decided I would be better off with a thinner, lighter, quieter, cooler, longer battery life laptop by sacrificing that extra CPU power and optical drive. ASUS makes some nice thin and lights that I've used in the past, but their track pads are awful and screens aren't great either.


**Decision: **

The Macbook Air 13 seemed to fit the bill perfectly for me: Thin, light, awesome trackpad, decent enough CPU, discrete graphics, good battery, great screen. (Decided to get the upgrade to 4GB RAM too to hopefully future proof this a bit- you can't upgrade the RAM after the fact) The only issue was that I am a Windows guy and this thing runs Mac OSX. After thinking long and hard, I came to the conclusion that there are actually very few pieces of Windows only software that I used and, if absolutely necessary, I could bootcamp Windows. Additionally, as much as I love the flexibility of Windows, I am ready for something that takes much less maintenance. Also note that the 11 vs 13 Air are really quite different machines. I could never see the 11 being my primary machine- a bit slower processor/less battery life/smaller screen with less resolution. Would be a great portable secondary, however.


**First impressions of hardware:**

Wow, this thing is ridiculously light compared to any PC I've used. I read and watched enough reviews to expect this, but it is still had quite a wow factor to it. My girlfriend's Macbook looks like an 80's Cadillac next to this thing. 

One of my biggest reasons for a Mac is the amazing trackpad. Windows/synaptics just can't seem to get this right- I could never use any of my other laptops comfortably with the trackpad; a mouse was necessary to get anything productive done. As expected, the trackpad on the Air is awesome- just like all Macs these days. I find that using the trackpad makes me much more productive than a mouse, actually. This is credit to the powerful and responsive gestures that it can recognize. 

The 900px tall screen is awesome as well. Quite a step up from the 768 14inch Envy screen. My eyes are still young and the smaller text is well worth the extra pixel real estate this screen gives me. 

Battery life is a welcome step up from most Windows PCs. I feel like I am finally able to bring this around with me and not have to constantly be checking the remaining battery- a great feeling for a portable machine. The magsafe power adaptor is a great change from the usual bulky power cords and bricks that most PCs have. Mac people take this for granted, I'm sure, but it is definitely noticeably better when transitioning from Windows laptops. 

CPU/SSD combination absolutely flies, as expected. I've been using SSDs for a year now and will never go back to mechanical- the HDD is most people's bottleneck these days for general use. As I'm not using this for heavy gaming or video editing, the GPU/CPU combo is plenty for my needs- this will not be good enough for everyone's main machine, obviously. 

Most importantly, the Air is absolutely SILENT 99% of the time- only having the fan kick in when gaming so far. This shows just how cool this laptop stays as well- the bottom never gets warmer than ""warm""- I can use this on my lap on the couch or bed without starting to sweat like I did with my Envy.

My only real gripe with the hardware is the lack of a backlit keyboard. I had this on my Envy and it is hard to lose it. Not necessary by any means, but I do miss it and it doesn't appear that it couldn't have been included. I would gladly have paid an extra $100 or so for this.


**OSX:**

This is, well, different than Windows. I'm liking it thus far, but it will take some getting used to. Love Expose with a four finger swipe- makes me not miss alt-tab much [edit: Cmd + Tab does the same thing - thanks omgdiddles]. The lack of a true full-screen button was strange at first, but with the high resolution screen, it is not a big deal at all. 

Additionally, I've found nothing, thus far, to make me want to bootcamp Windows onto it. Some Windows only games would be one reason, however, the only games I really play are cross-platform via Steam. I've only dipped my toes into this OS so far- it will be a while before I could ever really give it a good review coming from a Windows experience.

Overall, I am 100% happy with my purchase. For the price I paid, I would accept nothing less- I was fully prepared to return this if need be. I would definitely recommend the Air for any first time Mac user who doesn't have a need for a high powered machine. It is important to note that in no way does high powered = snappy/responsive. While this is not the former, it is certainly the latter- much more so than my girlfriend's Macbook Pro (without an SSD, of course).

apple,I hate Numbers.app,"There. I said it.  And I feel better slightly better doing so.
 
Here's the deal, Apple.  You tried to make a some weird amalgamation of a traditional spreadsheet and a column-driven page layout tool.  It fails at both.  Spreadsheets are supposed to be ugly/simple and they are supposed to be fast and Numbers is neither.  Specifically, here's my complaints:
 
* Numbers.app is slow to start.  I don't have an i7 processor -- but it's a spreadsheet application.  It isn't that complicated.  My heart sinks a little when I accidentally open a csv (that I meant to open in a text editor) and I see Numbers start to bounce in the dock.
 
* ""Some warnings occurred.  Would you like to review them now?""  **No.**  I *never* want to review them.  No one ever wants to review them -- because they are always meaningless to the task at hand.  ""What?  I'm missing a font?""  How does that impact my menial chore of changing some numbers in some cells?  Was the font Comic Sans?  Was it supposed to brighten my day?
 
* There's the option to show a ruler.  Let's just save both of us some time and swearing on my behalf and let me suggest this shouldn't be an option in any spreadsheet.  Ever.
 
* Spreadsheets don't need ""Styles"".  Least of all, they don't need a ""Styles"" toolbox that I can't hide.
 
* Furthermore, why can't I hide the left drawer entirely?  Especially if a document only has one ""sheet"".
 
* If I focus a cell and drag it downward, I can repeat the value of that cell as far down as I want to drag.  This is expected behavior.  You know what *isn't* expected?  If the value is a single letter, like ""R"", I'm given the next letters of the alphabet?!?!  S followed by T followed by U ... and once it hits 'Z' it starts over at 'A'?  Who thought this was a good idea?  FIX:  Look for patterns if a user selects multiple cells.  If I select two cells with the respective values of ""1"" and ""2"" or ""A"" and ""B"" then you can then make a guess as to what I want.  Excel does this correctly.  If I select a single letter -- don't assume anything.
 

Ok, that's a good start.  And I'm not going to go into the options of embedding ""Shapes"" and ""Media"" and things like that.  I just want you to understand that sometimes the elegance of an application is dictated by its simplicity.  You understand this in several other areas, but unfortunately you missed the mark with Numbers.
 
**EDIT**:  I don't want to give the impression that Numbers doesn't have useful features.  It does.  My annoyance is that it makes for a poor *spreadsheet* application.  Many people indicate they like the presentation layer of Numbers.  That's cool.  What I'd rather see, however, is a new Reports.app application to handle the stylized display of information (maybe this is already Pages?), and let Numbers focus on being a powerful spreadsheet program.  Much the same way I don't want Pages.app or Keynote.app to focus on being nice graphics editors -- even though any given project might heavily leverage graphics in the final design.",88,41,2011-02-09,AAPL,0.09755665063858032,0.8787135481834412,0.023729773238301277

apple,"Macbook Air users: In terms of everyday use and lugging around, is the 1.5-pound difference between the high-end 13-inch-model compared to the 13-in MBP make up for the performance loss?","I realize this is completely subjective, but I just wanted to hear the experiences of people who have the new Air and whether the tradeoff in weight vs. performance was worth it, in the several months that you've had it.

Getting the 13-in Air seems like an obvious choice for me. I've had a 15-in MBP for the last two years, so getting something that is half the weight would be worth the limitations of the Air. But what holds me back is knowing that the new 13-in MBPs may be around the corner. I've never had a 13-inch laptop before and that decrease in size might be good enough for me, without having to sacrifice performance.

From the Apple tech pages:
http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs-13inch.html
http://www.apple.com/macbookair/specs.html

The top-end Air is only about 1.5 pounds lighter than the 13-in MBP. That doesn't seem like very much at all.

Performance isn't *that* big of a deal for me...I've pretty much settled into a routine where all my work involves using TextMate and opening a lot of Google Chrome windows; I do use Photoshop a lot for editing photos, but bulk jobs I can reserve for my current laptop, which would sit at home if I don't sell it.

But if 1.5 pounds isn't that big of a difference, then I might as well wait for the MBP. Or I guess I could just go for the 11-in Air, but the screen-size may be too small for even just coding in TextMate. Anyway, just interested in hearing other users' perspectives, I know this is an eternal debate.

Heres mine to start us off. Answering any questions you guys may have, please do the same!
http://d.pr/w4Ec


Edit: Folks have asked for how todo mine so heres a full readme.

Download my files here first. http://d.pr/xqrg

This is going to be a doozy. I would recommend making a time machine backup just in case you mess something else or end up not liking what you end up with. **This will only work for Snow Leopard ** First things first you are going to need to download Themepark4. This is an application used to modify system resource files which control how your system looks. Also install the fonts provided in the fonts folder. Before we start our little adventure, its important that you follow the steps sequentially. There are some changes that change other ones we make as we go along so if you end up not following directions, it wont work.

1. Goto System Prefferences &gt; Appearance &gt; Change from blue to graphite. Goto System Prefferences &gt; Desktop and Screensaver &gt; Turn OFF Translucent menubar.

2. Head to the files that I provided, Double click ""SympaTheme"". This should open in themepark 4. Hit ""Apply"" in the window that comes up. You can do some poking around here if you want. This will change your menubar to clear as well as your apple logo in the upper left.

3. You are going to need move ""Extras2.rsrc"" into the following filepath. **DELETE THE FILE THAT IS CURRENTLY THERE AND THEN PUT IN THE FILE I HAVE PROVIDED.** If you don't do this a permissions issue will prevent the change from occurring. *This will change your system font from black to white for your menubar only.*
    /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Resources

4. Next we change your system font. Open up the Helvetica Condensed folder. You'll see two alias folders and a font file called lucida grande. Open both the ""Protected"" and ""System"" Folders. Delete the current LucidaGrande.ttc file from both those folders. Then move the file I provided into both of those folders. If you just try and cmd+v the file in without removing the previous you will encounter a permissions issue that will prevent itunes from accessing the font file. Aka you get no text inside itunes.

5. Changing menubar icons. For applications right click the application and hit show package contents. Contents&gt;Resources&gt; and there should be a list of .png files for thier menubar icon. Invert the icon you wont from black to white in photoshop. I provided an adium icon already.
For the spotlight and other system icons it gets a bit more tricky. I've only modded spotlight and airport because those are the only icons I use. If you want to use more you'll have to mod them yourself. They can all be found within the directories below. right click example.bundle or example.menu and hit show package contents. Inside the resources folder is the menubar icon. Cheers!
*Put Search.bundle into the following file path:*
    /System/Library/CoreServices
**DELETE THE CURRENT SEARCH.BUNDLE FILE AND THEN REPLACE IT WITH THE ONE IVE GIVEN YOU**
*Put airport.menu into the following file path:*
    /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras
**DELETE THE CURRENT AIRPORT.MENU FILE AND THEN REPLACE IT WITH THE ONE IVE GIVEN YOU**

6. Almost there folks, promise. Restart at this point and do a disk permissions repair.

7. Now to deal with the menubar shadow. We have two options here, if you use a light background you'll need to use desk shade, it will cover your desktop with a blanket image above the menubar shadow. I don't like this approach though because it covers geektool scripts.
Download my PSD template:
http://cl.ly/0r1t1k2S0L1W0l1N0t2y
Explanation:
This method only works for a wallpaper that has a luminance below 150 pixels at the menubar shadow portion. What I did was screenshot the desktop with a white background. Opened that screenshot ontop of the background i wanted to use. Invert the screenshot and set the layer mode to color dodge. This effectively neutralizes the menubar shadow.
Tldr - just copy paste in the wallpaper you want to use below ""layer 13"" and have fun.

8. Last but not least, you'll need a copy of Istat menus. Use this to replace the battery indicator and time / date with white text.",373,88,2011-02-13,AAPL,0.04089464619755745,0.933372437953949,0.025732881389558315

I have had an iPod touch for the past 2 years and it still works just as good as the day I bought it, so hopefully it's a sign of what all their products are going to be like. 

Also, what kind of Macbook should I get? A regular vanilla one or a Pro? My intention is to use one for writing, graphic design and maybe some light photography. Oh, and just one last thing: should I get any accessories like extra software or an Apple-brand USB mouse or one of their cases/macbook sleeves?

3rd: Another cheap plastic incase knockoff. I was bored so I slid my phone down the road going down the steep hill scratching the back to hell. (1 month)

4th: Another cheap perforated black plastic incase knockoff from the markets. Paint started peeling and case started cracking. (2 Months)

5th: Freshfiber Weave case picked up in Dubai, by far the most unique case I've had. http://www.freshfiber.com/ Adds a fair bit of chunk to my phone but I really like it.

apple,Should I buy a Mac? (lifetime PC user),"Every single PC I've owned has crapped out on me (all physical failures). And frankly, I've had enough.

I'm also sick of laptops, so I've been looking at the iMac. It's going to be my home computer, which I'll use for all the usual stuff (internet, Minecraft, ect), but I'm also going to use it for audio editing and recording voice work.

The 21.5-inch: 3.06GHz iMac is what I'm looking at. 4GB memory,
500GB hard drive. I figure this is more than enough for what I plan on using it for (then again, I'm a computer newb. Correct me if I'm wrong). I can also save a few hundred by buying it refurbished, and this'll be cheaper than the first laptop I bought, even with the Apple Remote and battery charger included.

iphone,"Hello r/iPhone, I made a small, simple app to hopefully make studying for midterms a bit easier. Promo codes inside! (iOS4+)","Hi reddit!

There are lots of flash card-like applications on the App Store but a lot of them require entering text in small, one-line fields or using an interface that is too busy. I wanted something quick and dirty and that I have full control over, like real, paper index cards. So I made StudyCard. It's my first foray into iOS development and I'd love any suggestions you might have. I'm a university student so it's just a small side project for me, but I hope it comes in handy to some people.

[iTunes Link with Screenshots](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/studycard/id419538814?mt=8&amp;ls=1)

Features:

* Simple interface: Hit ""New Deck"", and it brings you to a blank card. Tap the flip button to flip the card, swipe left to add a new card.

* You do the grading: StudyCard does not try to guess if you've gotten a card correct or not when quizzing, you tell it. This means when you're making cards you don't have to follow some rigid set of question ""types"", you can set them up however you want and make your deck that much faster.

* Dropbox Syncing: If you have multiple iOS devices, you can link your Dropbox to StudyCard and then save to and load from a subdirectory on Dropbox. When synced through Dropbox, all your statistics are saved in these files so you can track your progress across all the devices.

* iTunes File Sharing: From StudyCard, you can email your project files (without your grading history and statistics included) to friends and whoever, and they can load it on their device either using Dropbox or by dragging the file into iTunes.

* Coming Soon: Import CSV files (Excel and other spreadsheet applications) into StudyCard as a deck.

If anyone's interested, I made a couple sample projects that you're welcome to play around with (I use them for testing purposes). Again, you can download this file and load it through iTunes (the ""Apps"" tab of your device once you have StudyCard installed) or put it in a ""StudyCard"" subdirectory of your Dropbox with your device linked.

iphone,AT&amp;T Charging $2.00 for 1kb data transfer?,"I know this isn't really an iPhone related question, but I figure this is the highest concentration of AT&amp;T customers on Reddit.

So here's the deal, I have a family plan with 3 other phones, I'm the only iPhone. The other 3 do not have data plans, but this month all accrued $2.00 charges for data transfer. They all used a ridiculously low amount of data in order to receive this charge. I'm guessing what happened was that they accidentally clicked the AT&amp;T store on their phone and accessed the internet. Seeing how they only used 1-5kb, they must have immediately closed it after realizing their mistake.

This kind of seems like a scam...charging $2.00 for 1kb of data? They don't use data transfers and any time there is one it's obviously a mistake yet AT&amp;T leaves this option openly available to skim off some more money every month? Our bill is $6 higher because the three of them all accidentally transferred a minuscule amount data over a 30 day period.

I understand that the $2.00 charge is to allow a certain amount of data to be transferred before it charges again, but I do not know how small that number is and it's irrelevant because they aren't actually trying to use the data.

**So my question is this...what can I do? Will contacting customer support solve the matter? Or will they just blow me off and say it's part of their policy? Is there a way to deactivate the possibility of transferring data on a phone?**

Here are pics of the charges:

apple,"It's silt like this, Apple.","About half a year ago I managed to drop my MacBook Pro onto a plug, went straight through the top clamshell, cracked LCD, massive ugly dent. I'd been using it connected up to a TV for a number of months.

I didn't realise there was an Apple Store in Brighton, near why my Mum lives. On a visit down, I decided to take a walk in and talk to one of the 'geniuses' and find out how much it would be to repair.

I explained to the woman my situation, and asked how much she thought it would be to get it repaired. She said it would be a lot of money (around £400), but I replied ""oh that's fine, I've been saving up, I have £450"". She must've acknowledged the fact that I had really tried hard to save up this money, or maybe it's just standard Apple protocol nowadays, but after this she said ""well, considering it's your first repair, we can get that done for free for you"", for free!

I explained to her about how I was only down for a little while and I was going home on Tuesday afternoon (it was a Saturday), and she promised me she'd get it done by Tuesday morning.

Two hours later, once I was back at my Mum's, I got a call from Apple telling me my repair was done, and if I was nearby, the store was open for another 17 minutes and I could go pick it up. I wasn't, but I did get it the next day.

They had replaced the whole top clamshell, so I have a brand new looking laptop, no more dent, a beautiful new screen, and £400 in the bank (I splashed out a little after the good news). All for free!

I am absolutely amazed by the kindness of the woman and just the general customer service at Apple, I just had to share this story! Thank you Apple!

iphone,Some tricks to make your Jailbroke iPhone stand out.,"Recommended for iPhone 4 &amp; 3GS only (4.2.1)

It's been a while since I've seen one of these so I figured I would make an updated post. The vanilla iPhone experience tends to be a bit bland at times and lacks a lot of functionality &amp; personality that other mobile devices are starting to show off. With a few simple tweaks from Cydia you can really give your device a bit of flair to make it stand out in an otherwise bleak crowd. Not all of these are free but I feel that the relatively cheap price tag on most will make even the most frugal amongst us bite the bullet and spring for a few new toys that will be sure to turn a few heads.  

The first one and definitely my favorite is [Barrel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9F7MdyyUEk). This $2.99 tweak really gives your phone a fresh feel and makes everyone with an iPhone jealous. 

Next up is [LockMS](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=995787). This one is free and is a huge break from the standard iPhone lock screen. This one requires you to be a tid bit more tech savvy if you want to make it really pop and as stated in the link it couples best with LockInfo. Full instructions on how to change the wallpaper is also included in the above link, but if your comfortable with iFile then it should be a breeze.

Another great new addition is actually borrowed from our friends over in Android and is the [TV Tube Sleep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA4erhyQMC8) lock animation that gives your phone the old cathode tube effect when you hit your lock button. This one is only $0.99 and is worth every penny.

This next one isn't necessarily additive to the functionality to your device and really has no other purpose but to show off. [Graviboard](http://ihackthatifone.com/graviboard/) will make your homescreen icons gain gravity and react with your accelerometer. It also lets you interact with them by making your finger a gravity well or a repellent of sorts. This one is a bit on the pricey side, like Barrel it comes in at just under $3.00.   

One more great tweak is [Gridlock](http://www.redmondpie.com/gridlock-allows-you-to-freely-position-your-apps-on-the-springboard-homescreen-jailbreak-req/). This allows you to freely place apps on the homescreen  where you want rather then having them line up from top to bottom.  This one will only run you $0.99.

iphone,Connect your iPhone/iPod to your car stereo and use your radio controls.  Better sound + much safer.,"Okay, the best thing I have ever done is add an iPhone/iPod car kit to my older Mazda (it doesn't have an aux input).  There are companies selling little devices that convert the signals from the iPhone/iPod to mimic an add-on CD player (or other device).  Most cars with a standard factory radio have a plug on the back for the optional CD changer that you probably didn't buy from that shady salesman.  These little devices let your iPhone/iPod pretend to be one of those add-on devices.

This company makes the one that I used for my Mazda3: http://www.gromaudio.com/index.html

They didn't have one for my Jeep so I used this company: http://www.usaspec.com/

These things are for older cars that don't have an Aux/iPod port and they really make the sound MUCH better.  Also, I can use the car radio controls on my steering wheel to skip songs and such.  They really aren't hard to hook up at all.  Basically, all you have to do is get the radio out, plug in the device, run the cord out to where your iPhone will be and stick the little box somewhere under the dash.  There are YouTube videos out there to help you get your radio out.  I found one that showed me the complete installation.  You shouldn't have to solder or anything.  Any of your friends that is handy with tools and careful about taking things apart should be able to do this.  My Mazda's dash and radio was held on with only two screws and a bunch of little clips that popped out.

Make sure you read the site information to make sure your car radio will have the plugs you need and that your iDevice is compatible.  The only annoyance is that Apple iOS puts up an error message on the phone in both my cars that the device isn't designed for the iPhone or something.  It's a bullshit message and they will work fine if you get the right unit from the vendor.

The only other thing you need is a really good mount.  This one on Amazon is outstanding: :http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K9IPOC

apple,I installed a Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drive into my MBP. Here's my review.,"Yesterday I installed a new Seagate Momentus XT hard drive into my MBP. The Momentus is what is referred to as a ""hybrid"" drive, because it contains 4GB of SSD memory in addition to being a 500GB 7200 RPM hard drive. The 7200 RPM is a decent improvement over the stock drive as it is, but the big news is the 4GB cache. The cache works automatically, because the drive stores the most frequently used data in it to maximize speed benefits, and you have no control over what information is stored there. It may not sound like much, but boy howdy does it make a difference.

I ran some speed tests on my MacBook Pro (13"". 2.26GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM, 10.6.6) with my old drive, a 200GB Hitachi 7200 RPM drive, and the new Momentus XT. Here's the results:

Rebooting the machine (from chime until the first message appears in Mail, which is set to auto-launch): 
Old drive: 2 minutes, 2 seconds
Momentus XT: 34 seconds

Launching iPhoto:
Old drive: 11 seconds
Momentus XT: 4 seconds

Launching Photoshop CS5:
Old drive: 14 seconds
Momentus XT: 4 seconds

Opening 21 applications at once (until last application stops bouncing in the Dock):
Old drive: 56 seconds
Momentus XT: 12 seconds

Running the Photoshop Speed Test (http://clubofone.com/speedtest/):
Old drive: 1 minute, 57 seconds
Momentus XT: 1 minute, 10 seconds

I ran XBench a few times but it didn't report any speed improvement, probably because the uncached 4K block writes were dramatically slower.

As you can see, the machine responds much faster in everyday use. There won't be the dramatic speed improvements for lots of file activity as you'd see with a true SSD, but considering the Momentus XT sells for under $100 at Amazon, they're really not in the same class.

A few final notes: There are reports online of people having issues with noise and vibration. The drive I have is so quiet I believed at first that it wasn't working. If I put my ear to the case I can hear some clicking during disk activity. I have seen none of the spinning beach balls some users have reported, although I did upgrade the drive firmware to SD24 immediately after installing it. I haven't had time yet to determine whether there will be a drop in battery life with this drive, although I would suspect some since the drive doesn't spin down during inactivity (this may be addressed in a future firmware update from Seagate).

UPDATE: A few people have asked about drive temperature. According to [DiskRadar](http://diskradar.com/) (an **excellent** utility, BTW), the temperature is currently around 100 degrees F with little activity.

Also, I've experienced a couple odd issues (uh oh). Some programs have locked up without reporting any errors. Running fs_usage doesn't show anything amiss aside from some slow response times. DiskRadar shows a few Raw Read Errors and Hardware ECC Recovered errors, and it's possible the drive may be damaged (Amazon packaged it *loose* inside the shipping box with nothing but a single plastic bubble for protection), but I'm not discounting anything yet. More updates as events warrant.",37,29,2011-02-24,AAPL,0.058803021907806396,0.9087455868721008,0.032451383769512177

apple,"I'm excited for Lion too, but as a dev, please stop.","As a Mac dev for several years, this trend since iOS has me concerned. As developers, you sign an NDA not to share what you discover in the beta products Apple releases with the public. It's been this way for many years. There was a certain respect for the NDA in the past (often after Apple would send take down notices) but it's gone completely out the window lately. 

For the last few years, Apple has had to go out and now pre-announce most of the upcoming features, even before seeding developers, just to compensate for the press storm. 

I understand everyone wants to run to the press and show off the new cool features, but Apple gives these beta releases as a development tool. They don't have too. They could even just seed us with a version with a few hacked UI changes or even give us an even more sand-boxed environment to test compatibility in that may have even more subtle issues of it's own (think like the iOS simulator for iPhone development but for Mac). 

For me, it's critical that Apple continues to release these betas to continue to develop awesome apps for the Mac community. If Apple removes this privilege, apps are going to take a long time to come up to being compatible with the next OS X releases. 

Lion isn't ready yet. It's not for day to day use. Features are still tentative. These app and hardware compatibility guides pretty much useless at this point.

apple,Why I think Apple will never implement Blu-ray technology in any of their products.,"I've been lurking for quite a while. After the MacBook Pro update on February 24th, several redditors and users on Apple-centric forums have expressed complaints that Apple ""hasn't adopted Blu-ray yet."" Here's why I think Apple will never implement Blu-ray technology in any of their products:

1. First and foremost, I think it's safe to say that optical media (along with physical media as a whole) is dying fast. In my opinion, Blu-ray media is the last of this dying breed. Apple is generally known for only adopting technologies when they see longevity, growth, and serious practicality in up and coming or newly standard technologies. To Apple, Blu-ray promises none of these qualities. [To those who may comment about the plethora of Apple's technologies that have gone by the wayside in the last decade, I should stress that my point generally applies to technologies Apple has explicitly not collaborated on or directly created].

2. In the big picture of things, Sony is a competitor on numerous different fronts. Apple is hesitant to jump to support technologies from competitors, plain and simple.

3. In a world of awesomely powered laptop computers with specs out the wazoo, one of Apple's main selling points for its MacBooks is battery life. Playing a Blu-ray movie would certainly end the charge of a battery in a snap. Obviously the high definition video is awesome, so in Apple's eyes, why waste the battery life spinning a Blu-ray when you have... [see point 4].

4. iTunes. iTunes. iTunes. Not only is the iTunes Store the largest digital music storefront (to my knowledge), but also the largest and most successful digital movie/television show storefront. High definition content is the standard on iTunes and Blu-ray is a threat to the iTunes Store's sales. This ties into point 2 above: Sony is a major competitor to Apple in multiple markets, and Blu-ray is directly opposing the success of iTunes. If a consumer is in the market for legally watching a high definition movie, they have two clear options: a) buy/rent on the iTunes Store, or b) buy/rent on Blu-ray. Apple is not going to implement Blu-ray simply because it threatens the iTunes Store's sales.

The above serves as my unwarranted response to the users clamoring for Blu-ray. Personally I don't see very much usability with Blu-ray outside of the living room/den, but I can understand why many individuals want Blu-ray capabilities in their MacBooks. Yes, it's understandable; no, it's never going to happen. If Blu-ray is a make-or-break feature for you, there are plenty of Windows laptops ready to be purchased.

**TL;DR: Blu-ray is most likely the last of all optical media formats. It wants to take as many of the iTunes Store's sales before it dies. Apple won't ever allow its own products (i.e., MacBooks) to outright enable competition with its other products (i.e., the iTunes Store).**",279,142,2011-02-27,AAPL,0.043608542531728745,0.9251741766929626,0.031217236071825027

apple,How Apple made my weekend,"Okay, so I'm pretty upset because I'm on my third laptop since the summer of 2008 before I went off to college.

MacBook #1: Died March 2009 as a result of knocking over 32 ounces of hot tea on it

MacBook #2: Stolen in January 2011

So, I bought the MacBook Pro in late January, thinking this would be the one I would keep for the next couple years and into law school. As in, I was going to make it the thing I need to protect with my life.

Of course, on Thursday I find out the MacBook Pro had its massive upgrade.

So, I went to my local Apple Store tonight at a friend's suggestion, saying that maybe they'll upgrade it.

Even though it was a longshot as I've had it for about 6 weeks, I walked up to an employee explaining that I'm on my third laptop in 2.5 years and I'm slowly paying it off my credit card and that I was upset as a result of the abrupt upgrade.

After talking to the store manager for about 5 minutes, the manager asks me how long I've had it. After I told her that it was almost 6 weeks, but I bought it the day before the semester started. They both went into the back and discussed. After patiently waiting and trying not to seem nervous, I was told they approved the upgrade, despite it being over 31 days since the purchase.

I was elated and am currently charging up the upgrade. Apple's customer service is like none-other.

apple,"Apple's subtle plan to turn me into a movie pirate, or: HDCP/DRM is Rubbish!","After replacing my sadly defunct ATV Gen 1 with a shiny new black ATV2, initially I was very pleased - small, fast, cool. Pleased that is, until I actually decided to play a movie.

1. Movie starts playing.
2. Movie stops playing after 5 seconds.
3. Screen goes black, and then....


""THIS CONTENT REQUIRES HDCP FOR PLAYBACK. 
HDCP isn't supported by your HDMI connection.""


Well shiver me timbers.


I play a movie I ripped from disc (ahhhhhrrrr - it's just a backup copy!). No problem, looks great. But try any movie from the iTunes Store: HDCP error! Scuppered!


Mind you, I'm using exactly the same cable and TV as previously when my ATV1 was working, but now my legitimately purchased movies won't play because of some mysterious HDCP error with the ATV2. *The joys of being a legitimate customer!* 


I turn off the TV and ATV, plug them back in, turn them on in sequences, and try all this in various combinations as suggested by the Apple Support site and every single unhelpful forum I can Google. Nothing, of course. I wouldn't expect it to be easy. I mean, I paid for all these films. Would they want me to enjoy them and buy more? Of course not!


Now, I'm a simple guy when I'm home. I just want to put on a movie for my kids to watch. It's pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty straightforward. Except now I've got to spend hours calling some support number to begin the painful process of *ME* having to sort out a problem caused by the movie industry in their attempt to prevent me becoming a pirate.


I mean, if this is what's going to happen, they should just hand out fucking eyepatches and parrots in the goddamn Apple Stores!


The Genius Bar guys should just be straight up - 
*""Hi, buying an ATV? Well, here. Take this simple copy of Handbrake! Make sure you check the system requirements - did you see we recommend a 100gb/month internet plan and an account with Demoniod?! Yes, you'll need a Bit Torrent client! We recommended Transmission!""*


I'm sure if I tried, there's a really simple solution. I probably just need to put the ATV to sleep, turn the TV off, turn it on, wait 10 seconds, wake the ATV, turn the TV off, reset my network, turn the tv on, and then *simply play my movie*. I probably just need to do this every day or something!


I know it's pointless to complain. I mean, I should just waste my time trying all this shit until I find where the problem is! Because, you know, my charge out rate is only $300/hour and *I know* Apple will have no problem in me sending them an invoice for the time I spend to get it all working fine.


But in the end it doesn't matter. Their cunning plan has worked, because I'm tired and have better things to do. Stuff the iTunes store, now I'm downloading every single fucking thing I can find.

**edit:** Grammar! Very useful - thanks PoundingOutVag. Give him some upvotes for away/aweigh.
For those of you suggesting fixes, thanks. I've tried mostly everything. I'm going to try going to the Apple shop *once* and then it's a jailbreak. I am also painfully aware that this is all not completely Apple's fault, but they are complicit.

**Sudden thought**: Australia (where I am) has very good consumer rights. Basically, if a product is not fit for purpose, I can insist on a repair/replacement/refund. This goes beyond any manufacturer warranty. Could I insist on a repair hard enough to get them to strip the HDCP from media?

apple,THIS is why I'm an Apple fanboy,"I've been buying Apples since 1990.  Been actively evangelizing since about 1994.  I work in engineering, so I've been fighting the Wintel menace as long as I can remember. I am an unabashed Apple fanboy.

I recently began indoctrinating my 2 daughters into the greatness that is Apple, and they have followed me in my love for this company.  For Christmas of this year, I got each of them iPhone 4s, and they were the happiest kids on the planet that morning.  All was well.

Until my oldest daughter did her laundry one day and forgot to take her iPhone out of her jeans.  Less than 2 months old.  Submerged for 20+ minutes.  I went apoplectic, of course, but it wasn't going to save the phone.  A week of the rice method, blow drying, and praying yielded no results.  The iPhone was dead.

I did my research and realized that Apple had a service program for iPhones that had received damage not covered by warranty.  $199 would get you a refurbished phone.  I told my daughter to prepare to bust her ass earning the $199, and after 2 weeks of vacuuming, laundry, washing my car, etc. she was up to $100 so I told her she could owe me the rest and we headed to Apple for the replacement.

We get there, check in for our appointment time slot, and the greeter did much to reassure my daughter about how common her mistake was, explaining that she sees this on a daily basis.  After about 10 minutes a Genius walks up and asks for our story.  We tell him.  He explains that water damage isn't covered under warranty, and that there is a $199 replacement fee for another iPhone.  I nod my head in understanding.

He walks away.  About 5 minutes later he comes back.  Hands my daughter a new phone.  He says he looked her up in the system and saw that she had no incidents in the past, so they decided to issue a one-time exception and there would be no charge for the replacement phone.  I stood there dumbstruck.  I said ""What?"".  ""We made an exception - if it happens again, you will have to pay full retail price.  But there is no charge for this phone,"" he said.  I just smiled at my daughter and said ""I guess I owe you $100.""

My loyalty, already at an unparalleled height, increased even more.

TL;DR - My daughter put her near-new Iphone 4 into the washing machine for 20 minutes and Apple replaced it free of charge.",153,97,2011-02-28,AAPL,0.044966597110033035,0.9120833277702332,0.04295012727379799
apple,Buying a new Macbook Pro? Check it before you leave the store!  (X-post from r/mac),"I just bought the newly released 15"" Mac book Pro (15"" non-glossy w/ high-res display).  I opened it up as soon as I got home, and found it had a big [dent](http://i.imgur.com/WN6AI.jpg) right out of the box!


I took it back and requested an exchange.  I opened this one in the store, it also had a dent!  In the same spot!  I should have walked away ... but I wanted to try one more time.  They brought me a second replacement, which was finally in brand new, unscathed condition!  My working theory is that dent on the bottom of the laptop is caused by sitting on top of the power cord in the box (poor packaging design).

Hopefully this was just a fluke and no one else will experience this frustration.  If you're looking for a new mac, please take the time and inspect your new purchase before you leave the store. 


**TL;DR** - I bought a new 15"" Macbook Pro and it had a dent.  The replacement also was dented.  The third was as I'd expect to get for paying a $2500 sticker price: Without damage or blemishes.  BEWARE.
