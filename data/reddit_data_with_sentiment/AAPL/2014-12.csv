iphone,"Friend beaten and left for dead, iPhone stolen, not reset, thieves are using his Facebook - where do we stand?","Hello, so sorry if i'm violating rules or in the wrong subreddit, my head is all over the place. The other night my friend was hideously attacked, left for dead with a brain haemorrhage and is now fighting in hospital. 

His phone, your average iPhone 4, is still active - the people who did it have been messaging women on his Facebook (location services off, unfortunately) and also updated his status.  

We're out of ideas, we don't know what to do and we're desperate - does anyone have any idea what we can do? We don't know his iCloud details so can't see if he has Find My Phone active - he's still unconscious. We just want to know who did this or at least get some scrap of an idea. 

Edit: You're all fantastic. 

Edit 2: I can't reply to you all but you've been wonderful. Thank you so much.

He's woken up and we've been informed today that he's eaten, and this was specified, an Angry Birds yogurt. The doctors say he'll be in hospital until well into the new year which is a heartbreaker but they're saying he will get better. 

The phone is off, they've finally factory reset/sold it or whatever - I can't do anything now but the police, apparently, acted quickly when his Facebook was used. 

Again, thank you so much for all your help and kind words.",102,226,2014-12-01,AAPL,0.11201801151037216,0.860079288482666,0.027902694419026375

apple,Love Safari but miss Chrome's Keyword Based Custom Search Engine? I found a solution,"[Safari Keyword Search extension](http://safarikeywordsearch.aurlien.net)

Chrome's keyword search engine ability is addictive. Where you can type a letter, hit space, and then type a keyword to enact a search on an engine of your choosing. 

Especially once I realized I could set it up where *reddit.com/r/AnySubreddit* as ""r"" and just type ""r apple"" into the url bar and go straight to this subreddit.

But Safari on Yosemite is so much more polished, not to mention the battery savings and iPhone integration is better than Chrome. Plus I was less efficient on reddit and some other sites that I use the Keyword search engine with. 

Then I found the [Safari Keyword Search extension](http://safarikeywordsearch.aurlien.net). It functions EXACTLY like Chrome in this respect. Once I set up Reddit to work with it I can now type ""r *AnySubreddit*"" and be brought right there.

I figured if I was having this problem and had zero idea that an extension existed to solve this, then others on here would probably be having the same issue.",21,85,2014-12-01,AAPL,0.0283554308116436,0.9295685887336731,0.04207603633403778

apple,"I'm a new convert, and I love Apple now","So I've been a software developer for years, never had a personal Apple product.  I always told myself I didn't want a closed ecosystem, I wanted to be able to hack around on my laptop/phone, Apple products were too expensive (didn't want to pay the hipster tax), and so on.  I figured the OS was a dumb frontend over FreeBSD, and never really gave it a chance.

Anyway, got a Macbook Pro as a work computer with my new company, and I can officially say that I get it. The ease of use, the form factor, the design aesthetic, the way the UI is designed to anticipate my actions, it's the most intuitive platform I've ever used.

apple,A month ago I released a competitive photo-sharing app and you guys were really supportive. The first update is live now and fixes some of the issues you raised.,"Last month, I launched a free photo sharing app for iOS called ROL. It lets users share a photo with three random people, and then those three people decide whether to pass it on to three more, and so on. I had some great feedback from /r/apple and set to work on putting together an update to fix some bugs and add support for the iPhone 6 and 6 chub.

The only phone I've not been able to test it on is the 6 plus, so if anyone has any issues let me know! Otherwise would love to get your feedback on the app in general. We've still got some features to develop so there's more to come!

To do this you will need to Jailbreak your iDevice, lets break down some misconceptions that people have about it. Jailbreaking is legal in most countries; check out the [""legal status"" part of the iOS jailbreaking article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking#Legal_status) for details.**, It is **NOT** inherently geared towards piracy, it is quite easy to jailbreak these days and **it is safe**, there is a 0% chance of bricking your phone and does not void warranty!

Here is a short video on Jailbreaking and Cydia, not required to watch but might help you get familiarized with the concept of jailbreaking and Cydia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEbCzkcrXJk

/r/jailbreak is a fantastic community, definitely check out the subreddit if you get interested in tweaking your phone or want to add a custom theme or font.
_______

LEGALITY OF EMULATION: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console_emulator As it states in the wikipedia article ""According to all legal precedents, emulation is legal within the United States."" BUT downloading roms or ISO's (games) that you don't own physical copies of is illegal and the same is true for most places [See here for more details](http://bit.ly/1FQRgOQ), I do personally own quite a large collection of games so it isn't a problem for me, just do the right thing K? K.

_______
**Cydia:** 
you can think of this as a kind of alternate app store that also has many, many themes, utilities, tweaks, fonts, apps and basically everything you need to customize every possible detail of how your phone functions and looks.

**Repo's**: think of these as file servers that hold the seperate libraries of tweaks, apps, themes etc. there are a few repos that come with Cydia and they contain a lot of stuff but you can add some new ones by going into Cydia then clicking on ""Sources"" then ""Edit"" in the top right and then ""Add"" in the top left"" then you type in the repo URL's that I have provided below.

**Repo's (Sources) you will need [Cydia app names]**(ignore this for now):

http://www.libretro.com/cydia/ [retroarch]

http://cydia.ppsspp.org/ [PPSSPP Dev-Working]





___

**Hardware you will need**:

* Windows PC (or emulated windows on Mac)

* iPad1/2/3/mini/Air or iPhone 4/4s 5/5c/5s 6/6+ on iOS 8.1.1 (newest firmware)

* USB to iPhone cable

**Software you will need (download these now):**

* iTunes http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/

* iFunBox http://dl.i-funbox.com/

* Taig Jailbreak for iOS 8.1.1 http://www.taig.com/en/


* SixAxis Pair Tool http://www.dancingpixelstudios.com/sixaxiscontroller/tool.html (only download this if you want to connect PS3 or PS4 controllers to your iDevice)

Optional software to enable PS1 games with retroarch: google scph7003.bin (I can not provide this but you put the file into the /var/mobile/Documents/.Retroarch folder)

__________
This should only take about 30 minutes to an hour before you can actually start playing games (not including update and especially backup times for you 128GB device owners :P

___ 


** Okay here we GOOOOOOOO** (Mario N64 Voice)

**1.** Go into iTunes and upgrade to the newest firmware and then BACK UP YOUR PHONE!!!!! This is seriously the most important step! As long as you do this then you are 100% in the clear from screwing up your phone so don't fuck it up! GOT IT!? I recommend making the backup on PC but iCloud Backup is fine.

**2.** Close iTunes and then run the Taig Jailbreak, follow the instructions and definitely don't unplug your phone. (seriously)

**3.** Once your phone is done restarting a few times and working its magic you should have a new app on your Springboard called Cydia. (YAY!) Your phone is now jailbroken, if at any time you want to set your phone back to stock then simply restore your phone from your backup and everything is all groovy.

**4.** Open Cydia and add the sources I listed, see the ""About Cydia"" section above if you forgot how to add them

**5.** Use the ""Search"" tab of Cydia and then search and install the following tweaks (your phone may reboot after installing some of these, do not be alarmed): 


* 


 * snes9X EX

 * retroarch

 * PPSSPP Dev-Working

 * iFile

    (Optional tweaks to enable PS3/PS4 controller support)

 
 
 


*  * btstack



 * controllers for all 







    
**6.** Download the Mercury web browser from the Apples official app store app (lol) , it has a download manager which is totally and completely unrelated to step 7, I swear. To download files in Mercury tap on the file link first to see if it is a redirect link or a direct file link, if you are not redirected then hold your finger on the link and then select ""Download Link"" huzzah, the file is downloading, you can watch its progress in the download manager which is accessed through the button with 3 horizontal lines at the bottom of Mercury.

    
**7.** **You need games**, this part I can not directly help you with but my friend google can so ask him about emu paradise and he will tell you whats up. You can download them onto your PC and then transfer them with iFunbox OR you can download them directly to your phone, I prefer PC to phone. Like I said above I play games that I own.

**8.** So the games are on your phone (or your PC) and now you need to transfer them to the proper folder, this is where iFunbox and iFile come into play, If you downloaded the games onto your PC then open up iFunbox, if you downloaded the games to your phone then open up iFile on your iPhone.

This part where you have to set the bookmarks kinda sucks but only has to be done once so don't be a weenie, you must push onwards, otherwise who is going to help Chrono beat the piss out of (or befriend) Magus? :)

**9a.** **If you are using iFunbox on your PC**: click on iFunbox Classic in the top left then click on ""Whateveryournameis's iPhone"" in the file browser on the left and then click on ""Raw File system"" then Navigate to /var/mobile/Documents, right click on Documents and select ""add shortcut"". I also suggest making a Shortcut for the Mercury download folder, to do this simply download a file into mercury and then use iFunbox to search for the file, once the file is found then cancel the search by clicking the red X on the right, then right click on the file and choose ""open containing folder"" now find the highlighted folder on the left, right click on it and add to shortcuts.


**9b.** **If you are using iFile on your iPhone/iPad**: click on the ""home"" button at the bottom then click Containers/Data/Application then swipe down to reveal the search bar, use this to search the first word of whatever game you downloaded (I searched just ""blades"" for Blades Of Steel), once the game shows up click on the little i button next to the name and then click on the ""directory"" section, CONGRATULATIONSSSSssss, you have now found your download folder for Mercury. Now you need to click on the Bookmark symbol at the bottom middle then click on ""Bookmarks"" also at the bottom and then the + symbol on the bottom right to add the bookmark, name it Games or Download. 

**10a.** **Transferring games on iFunbox**: Open your new shortcut to the Documents folder, it will be at the very bottom of your folder browser in iFunbox, Shortcuts have stars next to them like this: http://imgur.com/bA7p1NG Now you just drag and drop (or copy and paste) your game from whatever folder on your PC you saved it to into the Documents folder in iFunbox, its that easy, do you like that you fucking retard?

**10b.** **Transferring games on iFile**: Navigate to your Mercury download folder with the bookmark you just made but you should already be in it if you followed the previous step, tap ""Edit"" at the top right and then tap on the file then tap the clipboard at the bottom right and then select ""Cut""  then navigate to var/mobile/Documents and then tap ""Edit"" in the top right (again) and then on the clipboard (again) in the bottom right and select Paste! You can also make a bookmark here if you wish to make it a little easier. As of this second you can now play the game on your phone, good fucking job mate, I'm proud of you.

ALRIGHT YOU DID IT, IT'S TIME TO PLAY GAMES!!!..... Oh you cant? You're overwhelmed you say? You want to use a sweet as controller? Timmy is stuck in a well? It's okay, now I will explain how to setup the different emulators and how to connect up to 8(!) PS3 or PS4 controllers through bluetooth.

_____

**Retroarch:** This is a powerful emulator with many ""cores"" that can mimic many consoles, in fact it emulates all of the consoles listed above but for PSP I prefer the PPSSPP emulator and for SNES I prefer SNES9x EX but if you want to you can use Retroarch for everything (although I think the PSP core might not be ready yet for retroarch and PPSSPP is a flawless emulator)

**A.** (for people who want to use the touch screen as the controller) 

Once you know what game you are going to play and have it in the correct folder you can just go into Retroarch and select ""Load Content"" and select the game, once the it fires up it might load the proper overlay for the console that you are playing but if it doesn't for some odd reason then you can....

* Changing gamepad overlay: tap on the top of the of the screen (the arrow, not the alien symbol) to bring up this menu: http://i.imgur.com/UQIrJ3I.png then select ""Core"" then scroll down until you see ""Input Overlay"" select that and you should see the current config file for your overlay, they are in seperate folders so you have to tap on ""Up"" in the top left corner and then select the folder with the name of the system (psx, n64, snes etc) that you are playing and then the config file within that folder. Boom, resume your game and you are golden, go play some games.


**B.** (for people who are using PS3 or PS4 controllers) 

* Connect your PS3 or PS4 controller to your PC with a compatible USB cable.

* Run the Sixaxis Pair Tool on your PC while both your iDevice and Controller are connected to your PC.

* On your iDevice go into your settings and navigate to General&gt;About&gt;Bluetooth and enter that what it says next to bluetooth into the Sixaxis Pair tool (take your time and make sure it is correct) then click Update, the controller is now paired and you can unplug it from your PC, the controller will stay paired unless you pair it to something else. If you want to add more controllers then repeat as necessary.

* You installed Btstack on your iDevice right? If not then do that now by searching for it in Cydia and installing. Once it is installed go into your iOS settings and DISABLE the stock bluetooth and then scroll way way down until you see Btstack, tap on it and then tap on btstack again, it is now enabled.

* If you installed Controllers For All then you need to disable that in settings now because it is not needed for RetroArch and will interfere. It is only necessary for PPSSPP and SNES9x EX.

* Open up this settings menu: http://i.imgur.com/UQIrJ3I.png by tapping on the very top of your screen (the arrow, not the alien symbol) then select ""Front End"" then tap on ""Bluetooth Input Type"" and select btstack.

* Resume game and now tap on the alien symbol to bring up this menu: http://i.imgur.com/21LKCic.png then select Settings&gt;Input Options&gt;Device and set it to Sixaxis/Dualshock3 go back to the main menu and then ""Resume Content"" then go back into the alien button menu and choose ""Quit Retroarch"", this will save your settings. 

You're DONE, just launch a game and then press the PS button on your controller, the lights might continue to flash but you should be connected now, if you ever have trouble connecting go into your iOS settings and toggle btstack off and then back on again. 

___

**SNES9x EX**: Simple and efficient 


___



**A.** (If you want to use touch screen controls)

* Load a game......then play it. Yup, that's pretty much all there is to it.

**B.** (For Controllers see step B in PPSSPP section below)

____

**PPSSPP**: This is a **FAN-flipping-TASTIC** PSP emulator that has a very nice user interface.

___

**A.** (If you want to use touch screen controls)

* Open PPSSPP and click on the ""Game""tab and then select the game you want to play, if no game is shown then you have put the game in the right folder, it must be in /var/mobile/documents/ Other than that you are good to go because there is only 1 gamepad overlay.

**B.** (If you want to use a Controller) 

* Disable stock bluetooth in iOS settings

* Install btstack in Cydia and then enable it in settings&gt;btstack

* Install Controllers For All from Cydia and then enable it in iOS settings

* Launch SixAxis Pair Tool (If you have already paired your controller then skip this step and the next) while your iDevice and Controller are both connected.

* On your iDevice go into your settings and navigate to General&gt;About&gt;Bluetooth and enter what it says next to bluetooth into the Sixaxis Pair tool (take your time and make sure it is correct) then click Update, the controller is now paired and you can unplug it from your PC, the controller will stay paired unless you pair it to something else. If you want to add more controllers then repeat as necessary.

* Now just launch the game and you will see a banner saying that it is initializing bluetooth, then it will tell you to press the PS button on your controller (So do it)and holy donkey balls batman, you are basically a super hacker now, if you ever have trouble connecting a controller go into your iOS settings&gt;Controllers For All and press the ""Restart BTstack, Controllers For All"" button and then try again.

apple,Monthly APPreciation Thread for December 2014,"Here's this month's App recommendation thread. What apps have you been enjoying for the past month?
*****
**Guidelines**  

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.  
* One app per comment. 
* Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS and OS X are both game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a sentence or two, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention Native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc), because everyone knows about them.

**Last month's top five suggestions:**  


1. 1Password ([Mac](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/mac)/[iOS](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios)) - This is my favorite password manager, as everything always works just the way it should. I honestly and truly love 1Password and I feel this shoutout is warranted. - /u/aurora-_

2. [Transit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transit-app-now-citi-bike/id498151501?mt=8) (iOS, Free) - A transit app that looks good and has been pretty good so far in being accurate for arrival times. I've been using Routsey the past two years I've been in the Bay Area but Transit replaced it as my go-to app for transit info. One of my favorite features is the Notification Center widget that tells me the arrival times of the three closest public transportation. - /u/type40darsit

3. [Duolingo](https://itunes.apple.com/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french/id570060128?mt=8) (iOS, Free) - I uninstalled Alien Blue and installed this language learning app so I could be more productive instead of wasting time on reddit. It's free, and is available on all platforms. Great app, I already know some French so it's not too difficult right now but it's well designed and fun to do. - /u/GluteusMax

4. [TwoDots](https://appsto.re/us/yrND0.i) (iOS, Free) - I saw someone mention this somewhere else, and it's the most addictive iOS puzzle game I've played in some time! Best of all, it's free! In-app purchases are only if you are stuck on a level or want extra ""lives"", but honestly, I like that it cuts me off after 5 turns. I wouldn't get any work done otherwise. - /u/TBoneTheOriginal

5. [Rhombus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rhombus-for-reddit/id917422733?mt=8) (iOS, Free) -  If you want to try something different from Alien Blue, you might really like it! I find it to be much faster in loading content. - /u/alexp9000

apple,I made a Mac app to bring fine art to your wallpaper,"The app brings 68,000 works of public domain art to your desktop, and can filter the art by artist, technique, style, genre, or material. It was something to scratch my own itch; I wanted to be exposed to more art and knew that the best way was to have it right in front of me on the computer. So far my favorite artist discovered this way is Giovanni Battista Piranesi, for his etchings of Rome.

Here's the website for the app, called Artful. It costs about the same as a fancy coffee, but I still have some free App Store download codes for it. Please PM me if you would like one!

apple,"So yeah, Orbitz really *is* ripping off Apple users","I ran across that article yesterday talking about how Orbitz charges higher prices when it detects that a user is using an Apple device, and decided to test it out. It was shockingly easy. For the search I did (DFW &lt;-&gt; Orlando) all prices were [at least $60 higher](http://imgur.com/a/pUqLm) when Orbitz thought I was coming from a Mac. When I switched my user-agent string to IE9/Win and did the same search (from Safari this time, and over a VPN) the prices ""magically dropped"".

~~Apple folk: don't use Orbitz.~~

EDIT: Very, very few commenters in this thread are able to duplicate what I saw. I don't know why I saw what I saw -- a minimum $60 increase -- but almost no one else has reported seeing increases of any kind. I considered simply deleting this submission, but think that the counter-evidence is important enough that I'll leave it. If you want to try and duplicate it, feel free and be sure to post your results.

EDIT 2: Per /u/officialorbitz reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2od7px/so_yeah_orbitz_really_is_ripping_off_apple_users/cmmf1gc?context=3):

&gt; Our system stores the step-by-step booking process to specifically address customer service issues such as this one. You actually conducted two slightly different searches which caused you to see two different flights, which is the cause of the price difference.
&gt; When you searched on your Mac, the search criteria were the same except you also requested non-stop flights. The “PC search” is showing a Delta flight with one stop. The “Mac search” is showing a non-stop Sprit flight, which you requested in the initial search. See screenshots here.

SO: Given that nobody else was able to find anything even remotely suspicious except for me and my inconsistent search params, I'm going to retract the above, but leave the submission so that others can see what went down.

apple,Can't say I'm sold on the greatness of the rMBP keyboard,"The refrain I often hear around the internet is that Macbooks have some of the best keyboards out there. Having owned one for a few weeks now, I can only agree that they're not the absolute shit you might find on some low end laptops, but I'm not in love with it either.  

 

First off, just the wobblyness, it's not a big usability issue but just resting your fingers on them, you can definitely feel some wobble, they're not firmly in place like some better ones.  Touch the space bar, or the function keys, and just lightly move around a bit and there's a lot of dat wobble. 

 

The bigger issue is the key travel and feedback. Or, the lack of either of those things. There's so little key travel and feedback, that I often miss keystrokes because the difference between a completed press and a mispress is so little. I'll think I hit a key because the feedback is about the same as hitting one, only to have gaps in words. In theory the autocorrect should help a lot with that, but I had to turn it off because it hurt so much more than it helped.  

 There's also just so much softness in the keys, personally I would have liked a bit more resistance before a key gives, but ymmv, some people may like typing on a cloud, I do not. 

I understand that they're space constrained here,  but laptops as thin have done better, imo. And some things have nothing to do with space, such as the resistane before a key gives, or the impact you should feel when it bottoms out.  

 

All of this is ymmv, you may well love it. Just my mini review of one aspect of my new laptop.",93,65,2014-12-06,AAPL,0.039587490260601044,0.9191977381706238,0.041214779019355774

apple,iOS 8 and Apple TV 6.2 have turned my AirPlay experience into a nightmare,"Shortly after these updates became available I made the silly mistake of updating all of my devices - my iPhone, iPad and Apple TV - to iOS 8 and Apple TV 6.2 respectively.

My Apple TV is 90% there for me to AirPlay music or video from my iPhone or iPad to my TV but now my stream will constantly drop, pause, continue to play but without sound, or (in the case of music) show ""unknown"" as the artist and album. I've also noticed I can no longer wake my Apple TV using the remote app. The only way to fix any of these problems is to restart all my devices at the same time and even then the issue always comes back within an hour or 2.

So my wife's brand new unlocked iPhone 6 128 GB was stolen today. We are not sure how or when it happened but the possible theories are either it was swiped from our garage while we were unloading the car or else it happened while my wife was dropping off our little kid at preschool.  

We know exactly where the phone is because we can track it through Find My iPhone, which pinpoints it to a house about 5 minute drive from where we live in a slightly shady area. I went there and activated the sound on the stolen phone while actually sitting right outside their living room. I saw the thieves actually getting up and going to disable the sound (though I am only assuming this, I never actually saw them holding the phone). The perps are fairly rough looking and the house looks like it could be a meth lab. 

We went to the police and they say they don't chase around for people's phones based on the gps data because they are too busy for petty stuff like this.  No amount of arguing could convince the cops to do anything about this, sadly. 

Our impulse is to get together a bunch of people and go to the house but that would probably not end well for us and so not going to do that.

Is there anything else that you guys could suggest we can do? The phone was locked and password protected. We immediately put it into lost mode but didn't wipe it so we can keep tracking it.  The phone is still broadcasting its location as we speak. The thieves have ignored all our text messages and calls. We did put in a screenlock message with contact info but it's clear they are not returning it. At one point earlier in the day, I sent a text message to it saying the cops are on their way and immediately saw them leave the house and do a long loop around the neighborhood only to return later to the same house. Of course the cops don't give a shit so that didn't work. 

Any other ideas from this community would be much appreciated. Is our phone as good as gone? Is there any way to inactivate the phone without handing it over to the thieves? Thanks in advance!

PS. We are located in Edmonton, Canada.

Edit: Does anyone know if they can still see our text messages in lost mode? What can and cannot they do with a locked iPhone 6 in lost mode? Thanks.

Update 2: Thanks for the replies. This is super helpful. As per suggestions from you guys, here are the links to contact the police service in Edmonton (though I'm not sure this will do much):

[@edmontonpolice](https://www.twitter.com/edmontonpolice) on Twitter. 

[Edmonton Police Service](https://www.facebook.com/edmontonpoliceservice) on FB.

As of 10:30 am MT on Dec 9, the phone is still on with about 30% battery power left and still at the same location.

Update 3: The police reconsidered and sent a car to the house just before noon our time. As of 12:30 pm MT still waiting to hear from them. Thanks again for your help! Reddit is so awesome

Update 4: The police are now on the case full on, watching the house and plotting their moves. Phone still on. More updates coming.

Update 5: 6:21 pm MT The police have a plan in place. The house is ""well known"" to them. Phone still on.

FINAL UPDATE: THE POLICE HAVE RECOVERED THE PHONE!!! They ended up going to the house and confronting the guy. He initially denied it but eventually, after some threats, he gave it back. It's in perfect condition. Likely not enough evidence to press charges but we don't care about that. Thanks reddit for all the great advice! ! Also thank you to the Edmonton Police Service for recovering the phone. Once they took on the case, after a bit of convincing, they were actually awesome.

apple,Boy did I ever get robbed this weekend...,"Hi all,
I'm posting here as more or less of a last resort.  This weekend my apartment was burglarized.  The police were even impressed by the shear size of the haul: My Macbook Pro Retina, my iPad air 32GB, my Canon 60D with lenses and Rode videomic pro, a Nexus 7, a Galaxy S4, a PC laptop, a TV....the list actually continues on.  The first few items leave me desperate--I'm a video editor by trade, and will need to replace them almost immediately.

We, sadly, have no insurance.  A major mistake, I know.

I have Find My iPhone turned on for the macbook and iPad.  So far, they just show as ""offline,"" and I have them set to notify me.  Presumably, the Macbook can just be reformatted fairly easily.  

Questions:
1) How sturdy is the iPad lock?  Have people found ways to easily defeat a locked iPad?
2) I have the serials for both Apple devices.  I've reported them to the cops, but I don't have a lot of faith in them.  Is anyone here familiar with a method to use this information to find my stuff?
3) Is there a subreddit that would be more appropriate for these questions?

ipad,Another reason why you shouldn't buy iPads on Craigslist,"I'm sure there are many of these stories, but this one's a bit unique. TL;DR version at the end.

I bought an iPad 3 a couple years ago off of Craigslist and it's been treating me well since then. However, I recently purchased an iPad Air 2 and planned on selling my iPad 3.

When I bought the iPad 3, I was obviously a bit wary about it being stolen, and at the time, it was running iOS 6, so there was really only so much I could do to make sure it wasn't stolen, mostly just making sure that it wasn't associated with an Apple ID and that Find My iPad wasn't turned on. Everything checked out.

Fast forward to today, and I go to restore the iPad 3 and reset it to factory settings. When I went through the setup process, I was greeted with a message that said, ""East Allen County Schools will automatically configure your iPad.""

Weird..

When I click ""Next"", the configuration installation times out every time, so I was stuck.

Then I remembered buying the iPad on Craigslist and realized that I was most likely in possession of a stolen iPad for two years without even realizing it.

The odd thing was, I was able to restore it to factory settings after I first bought it without ever coming across that configuration message, but I'm guessing it was still connected to the school system in some way that when I updated to iOS 7 and then iOS 8 over the years, the system that the school was using was updated on the iPad as well (most likely in the background), thus the reason why I'm now getting that message at setup.

I ended up calling the technology department of the school and told them that I'd return the iPad to them, even if it was a couple years after it was first stolen. They were very thankful for the call and told me that this has happened a lot with their iPad program. So much so that they had to tighten the rules and make their program more strict.

I guess I'm glad that I at least got my money's worth out of it, but kinda bummed that I can't get some money for it and sell it. Safe to say I'm not going to buy an electronic device on Craigslist ever again.

iphone,True Life: My iPhone was stolen by a 9 year old [long],"Last night I went to a grade school basketball tournament to watch my goddaughter's game. We ended up hanging out for a while, watching several games. We said our goodbyes and I got in my car. I couldn't immediately locate my iPhone (a gold 5s), but I consider myself a bag lady and figured it was in my bottomless purse. I drove directly home.

After searching my bag, I quickly determined I did not have the phone. I logged into iCloud,  brought up Find My iPhone (and after resetting the password, which I couldn't remember), I tracked the device. I watched my phone go to the liquor store, WaWa (for the unfamiliar, similar to a 7/11 but God's gift to the earth) and then stop moving in a particularly sketchy part of town. At this point, the phone was stolen in one town and was now located in a different town. I have no phone, so I used FB chat to ask a friend to call the non-emergency line of the town it was currently located in.

The police arrive, but now the phone has moved to ANOTHER town, different from the first two. I put the phone in ""LOST"" mode, which put a passcode on (I didnt have one before, stupid I know) and put the message ""Please return this phone. Call XXXXXXXX"" with my boyfriend's phone number. The police suggest going to the town in which it was stolen, filing a report and asking them to facilitate the situation, as the phone is no longer in this district.

Meanwhile, my email pings with a ""PHONE FOUND"" message and spits out the exact address it was located in, a town in which my boyfriend knows several officers. He contacts an officer (unbeknownst to me, as I do not have a phone and am currently driving to the police department of the original town..). I decide to drive by the address first - after all, it could be an innocent person trying to return the phone, right? 

The police are already there, talking to a 13 year old boy who is denying the phone is there. The boy says he went to a basketball tournament and he is just watching tv. The officers question the only other person at the house, a 9 year old girl, who eventually turns over the phone. 

The mother arrives and demands to know why the police are in her house. She berates the boy, apparently her nephew, for allowing the officers to enter the home. The police explain her daughter swiped the phone from my purse at the basketball game, and the mother says ""Oh, well I dont know why she did that, she already has an iPad."" The mother clearly does not care, so the officers warn her that next time, she will be charged.

The officers return my phone, and I leave ( I had been sitting in my car watching this unfold). I drive about 6 blocks and realize the phone is flashing ""No SIM Card"". Furious, I turn around, but the cops are already gone. Every bit of me wanted to march up to that door and berate that awful mother, but I didnt. So I drive to that town's police department, speak to dispatch, and the officer returns to the home. After some questioning, retrieves the SIM card and gives it to me...

At that point, I had lost my patience. I signed complaints which will result in a fine for the mother, since the child is a minor. 

Super excited (kinda surprised actually) that Find My iPhone actually worked... I was lucky the kids didn't turn the phone off. Even removing the SIM, the phone still picked up WiFi and the signals. They also must have accidentally pinged their address.

apple,I've spent the last few days looking for widgets in iOS 8 that work for me. Here's what I chose and a little review on each.,"As the title states, I spend the last few days looking for widgets. Turns out, I'm pretty picky. I like widgets that didn't take up too much space, were functional, and easy to use *at a glance*. This was important, that's what widgets are for right? Anyways, here is a screenshot of all of them.

http://i.imgur.com/ByFOzkw.png

First up is [Simple Weather Widget by Back Bay Bytes LLC]
(https://appsto.re/us/rEPG2.i)

I was looking for a widget that showed today's weather *and* a forecast at a glance in a simple form. Yahoo's weather app looks so ugly to me and I don't need a stupid picture of clouds. This widget is VERY customizable. They have options for simple views of the today and forecast section. You can hide the forecasts and show the weather in 3-hour increments too. You can have both or you can hide both and just show the current weather. You can even choose the background color, even set your on photo in the back. It's awesome, takes up only as much space as it needs, and gives you only the information *you* want to see.

[WidgetCal]
(https://appsto.re/us/le5X2.i)

You can choose between month and a 5 day view. I chose a week where I had a lot more events than usual to show it in use. Definitely love the blocks for events that show how much I have throughout the day. They do correspond with colors of your calendar too, but I only had classes for that week, hence, all black blocks. The month view is pretty detailed too, but I don't need that much information, it's a little cluttered and clunky, and takes up too much space for me. But I'm sure there are people out there that like that.

[Agenda+ | Calendar &amp; Reminder Widget by Avanio Labs]
(https://appsto.re/us/Am2N2.i)

I'll be honest about this one. The developer has pissed me off and I really don't want to plug an app for him. Long story short, I bought his app pack (Agenda+ came with it) when iOS 8 first came out, mainly for his weather widget. Looked great, exactly what I wanted, cool! Only problem is the weather info is always wrong, making it useless. He promised updates and fixes to people for about a month, and has since been completely unresponsive to tweets and emails for over two months now. Took my money and abandoned me. But I digress, at least Agenda+ works. I like keeping my reminders and calendar separate, so I use this app. It has the ability to list calendar evens for a couple days, but I disabled that. Now it only shows a list of reminders. It's simple, nothing special. You can double tap to complete them. It's not bulky. Don't buy if you want updates or support though, it'll never happen.

Anyways, I hope this helps some people out. There really isn't a good resource on discovering widgets, but these are what I found after digging around for a while. If you have any alternatives that you like more, please share and let me know why!

apple,"As an Android guy who recently switched to an iPhone 6+, here are my thoughts after 2 Weeks...","English is not my first language and I´m not really good at it, so please excuse some typos.

I´m coming from the HTC One M8 and the Oneplus One, so I´m quite 
used to big phones and I have used Android as my daily driver for a few years now. I was quite skeptical when I got the iPhone, but since I also own a Macbook Pro and an iPad 4 I decided to get it instead of a new Android Phone to use features like handoff or Continuity. 
After 2 Weeks of use these are my thoughts about it...

-The 6+ has the best camera i have ever seen in a phone. I recently visited London and some of the Photos are took just look absolutely incredible, which is leagues better than android phone I ever used

-I love Touch ID. After 2 Weeks I cannot stand using a code to unlock my phone anymore, it just feels so slow compared to touch ID.

-I also love features like Handoff and Continuity. Its really cool that I can make calls on my Mac when my phone is charging across the room.

-iOS is not nearly as bad as i thought it would be. I still miss some features like customizable quick settings or widgets on the home screen, but its not nearly as bad as it was on my old iPhone 4.

-I like the design of iOS 8 far more than Androids new Material Design, it just looks a lot cleaner and more organized than MD on Android. It also has a consistent set of rules for apps so they all look kind of familiar, which android hasn't. Even some google apps do not follow their own guidelines for material design.

-The build quality is absolutely awesome. This phone feels like a premium phone, and it should considering the price tag. It feels so much better than plastic on some other high end android phones. My only complaint is the camera.

However, I have also a few complaints:

-There is a lot of wasted space. There could easily fit a 5th or even 6th app in the dock, but for some reason apple decided to not allow that.

-There is not a single feature that takes advantage of the huge screen. Instead, it is just a blown up version of the iPhone 6 UI. To be fair however, there aren't any on Android either, but it kinda feels pointless to have such a huge screen when in the end it is just the same as on the iPhone 5S, just bigger.

-1GB of Ram. This is my biggest complaint. It is so annoying when you buy a 900€ phone (got the 64GB Version) and you can't even have a couple of safari tabs open without reloading constantly. This is almost a dealbreaker. I know people always say iOS doesn't need more than 1GB, but it does. On my Oneplus One with 3GB i can have 10 chrome tabs, twitter, facebook, spotify and reddit sync open at the same time without reloading, and that phone is a third of the price of the 6+.

Overall, I really like this phone and i think it will be my daily driver for at least the next year. If it wasn't for the 1GB of Ram, it would be the best phone i have ever used, so I really hope apple includes 2GB in next years iPhone. I´m really not sure if I will ever go back to Android, I´m just in love with features like Continuity and Touch ID.",118,68,2014-12-20,AAPL,0.04253261536359787,0.9181921482086182,0.03927525132894516

apple,Finally took a leap and swapped from Android to iPhone - have quite a few questions that would be awesome if you guys could help me with :),"Hello All!

I'm fully aware that you may get quite alot of these - I couldnt see any Android to iPhone quick start guides in the side panel so I thought there would be no harm in making a thread :)

So all my life I have used Android from the original ""copycat"" Galaxy S all the way through Note's, nexus's and HTC Ones and ended with the TC ONE M8. 

But my contract came up for renewal and I was in the store and thought to hell with it, lets give apple a shot! I cant really say ""im not a fan of iPhone"" if I have never tried it. 

So I have a few questions about swapping over that I would love if you guys could fill me in with. (I have opted for the iPhone 6 Plus 64gb Space grey- Also I havent opened the device yet, I am going to open it on Christmas day..just because !!).

1) This Bend gate - Okay Ive seen the videos and the ""tests"" - but after these few months of the device being fully out there, is this something I should worry about? I have bought a spigen Glass screen protector and a plastic hard case slim profile one. Is this suitable protection?  I usually like having naked phones - if I dont like the case is this something I should be worrying about?

2) Life of the Phone - Realistically I will only have the phone for the two years I have the contract. While doing some research on my phone in the store - I saw alot of people complaning about how with every ios release devices seem to slow  (I read this about the newer ipads). Is this a reality, ive seen so many different arguments online? For example with my second phone HTC One M7 which is getting replaced I havent noticed any real slow down's that were not out of the box.

3) What should I expect to be ""annoying"" or different - I am fully open for a new os and new experience but for any Android to iOS user's what did you find annoying at first (that either made sense over time) or had to find a work around for?

4) What should I get excited for that maybe I may not know about? Or whats obvious!! I am really excited to use the camera - I hated the HTC One (m7 and m8) cameras and using on social media looked crap and moved away from twitter and instagram. 

I am really excited and going to start using both social media platforms a lot more for myself and my buisness, what else can get my pumped?

5) I'm aware of the app's that im going to instantly download - but with such a vast app store what are some apps (not games) that you really like that either take advantage of iOS and iPhone or that you think look beautiful and help you day to day?

6) Battery Life for the 6+ im quite a heavy user - lots of reddit, messaging, emails, few videos and a fair amount of spotify. Can i really expect a full day of heavy use? I seem to have found very different opinions from bad performance to pretty good!

7) What are some common things you tell to new users and even new converts ?


I hope these are enough questions to make this thread hopfully a bit more interessting for those coming to check it out and hopefully make it not as similar to many other threads. 


I am happy to be part of this Sub now and looking forward to being part of this community :) Fair well android - maybe I shall see you soon!

His genius is not just his ability to see what others cannot but also how he applies it.

What the competitors don’t seem to understand is you cannot get people this smart to work this hard just for money. Jony is Obi-Wan. His team are Jedi whose nobility depends on the pursuit of greatness over profit, believing the latter will always follow the former, stubbornly passing up near-term good opportunities to pursue great ones in the distance.

apple,My thoughts on carplay 2 months after the fact,"Edit- so great news! The Japanese can't translate correctly. What they call dimmer is actually brightness control. What they call brightness is actually black level. So I maxed out the dimmer, and upped brightness a hair, lowered contrast a little and the display is much improved on my 4000. Not iPhone good, but far better. It still lacks inertial scrolling or easy map movement, but I'm far happier today than yesterday. 

Ok, so I have been using carplay daily since the software update first came out for my Pioneer headunit at the beginning of October. I have played with every type of aftermarket Carplay headunit on the market, and have used my own headunit (the 4000-NEX) in my convertible Miata since the start. Here are my thoughts on Carplay as a solution to car infotainment, the performance of the various types of head units, my gripes, what Apple got right, and my hopes for future improvement. 

TL:DR Carplay is amazing, but the headunits need some serious work. 

Carplay as an infotainment solution. 

1. Carplay is the definition of plug and play. Carplay has only 1 setting. Do you want the home button and status bar on the right or the left side of the display? That is it. Carplay does not use bluetooth. All audio, video, touch responses, and microphone input work through the USB to lightning cable. There are no adaptors needed. Your phone only has to be unlocked. That means there is no pairing that you have to do with a new car when you first get in it. That means if your friend wants to use his iphone in your car there's no work that needs to be done. That means that you will never have a rental car with your contacts stored in it. Carplay does not lock out your phone. It does default to turning off your screen when you plug the phone in, but pressing the home button or the power button will wake it back up. 

2. Carplay is better than any other option that is currently on the market. It's smoother than anything else. the user interface is incredibly intuitive, and Siri is on point here. Perfect moment to describe this was I was driving to the bar with a buddy of mine. My phone went off to tell me that I had a text from my girlfriend. On the display a notification came down telling me that the text was from my GF, I pressed the notification, siri came to life, read me my message, and then asked if I wanted to reply. At this point I am given this screen. http://imgur.com/PahifF1,lAezzo1#0. I can either say ""yes"" or ""reply"" or ""don't reply"" or a host of other commands including call (insert name) and siri will respond. I can also press the buttons shown and siri doesn't have to try to guess what I want to say. Once I finish speaking my response Carplay reads me back my message and shows me this screen. http://imgur.com/PahifF1,lAezzo1#1. If siri got it wrong I press the second button. If it got it right I press the button on the right and move on with my day. In both cases I can use my voice to handle all of this as well. It is incredibly easy to do, and it takes longer to explain what it does than to actually have it do it. It was so fluid and easy that my friend was left dumbfounded. It just made sense. He just stammered ""wow I want that"" and had nothing more to say. 

3. When you open an app in Carplay, the app opens on your phone. You are controlling your phone. If you open Rdio on carplay you are controlling your Rdio app through carplay. When you open the maps app, you are using the maps app. This also means if an app takes a few seconds to load (maps) it will hang on carplay. Carplay is best seen as a second display for your phone. There is no magic to fixing the hanging. If the app is made faster it will load faster. Simple as that. Great apps in that respect are the built in iPod app, the Phone app, and any app that is already open. Once an app is open, switching to it is fast and smooth. Worst offender here is the Rdio app that loads at a snails pace on first boot and the built in Maps app. It takes a good 5-6 seconds on my 5s for these apps to fully launch. 

4. 3rd party apps need to support carplay in order to be controlled by the headunit. At the moment the apps are very very restricted. They can only be audio apps. They cannot have their own custom interface. They cannot create their own buttons. all carplay apps look like this. http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_1707.png Those arrows on the side are important. I'll get to that later though. 3rd party apps are capable of reading through complex menus, like for example searching through playlists you have made in Rdio, or local stations in iHeartRadio. You cannot do a manual search for music through carplay, but again your phone is not locked, so more complex stuff can be done from the phone. Siri does not control any 3rd party apps. It is strictly a touch only affair. Still, because the bar is set so low, this is the best way to control 3rd party music apps that has come out so far. Non carplay apps can still have basic music control through the now playing icon, but you cannot do a search through the menu system. Videos apps are not supported. You can listen to whatever is playing but carplay will never display video on a non-jailbroken iPhone. 

5. Apple maps as an interface is awesome here. It does a great job of pulling your recent addresses into the interfaces from texts and emails. Siri can control maps like nobody's business. If you are getting directions you have 3 visual options. A. You want guidance and voice. http://imgur.com/lJswQlA,PzvbJfr,mIAFW7z#1 B. you want guidance but no voice or C. You just want to see how far away you are from where you're going. http://imgur.com/lJswQlA,PzvbJfr,mIAFW7z#2. If you're in any other part of carplay while using the navigation you get this nice little button on the top of the status bar. Press it and the phone will jump right back to the map. http://imgur.com/lJswQlA,PzvbJfr,mIAFW7z#0

Honestly to sum it up, as an interface Carplay is classic Apple. Incredibly restricted at times in comparison to other options, like for example Pioneer Appradio or MyFordTouch, but it just works, and it works incredibly well. 

The headunits. 

There are two companies currently making headunits for the aftermarket. Alpine and Pioneer. Pioneer has 6 radios that support carplay. Alpine has 1. 

Pioneer has the NEX-4000, 5000, 6000, and 7000 that all have resistive displays and the Appradio 4 and the NEX-8000 that have capacitive displays. 

The Alpine ILX-007 is their carplay headunit and it has a capacitive display. Frankly, there is no reasonable carplay option available in my opinion. 

1. Of the headunits only the AppRadio 4 and the Pioneer NEX-8000 can use the full capability of carplay. Remember those arrows from one of the earlier pictures? If you see those arrows apple has gimped your carplay. You will not have smooth scrolling in menus like you're used to in your phone. Instead your display will jump in segments every time you swipe your finger or press the arrows. If you are in the maps app, the only way to scroll through the map area manually on the display is to press 4 arrow keys on the top, bottom left and right of the display. It is not intuitive. Buyer beware! Even though the Alpine head unit has a capacitive display, the more fluid carplay mode is disabled on this headunit. 

2. On the Appradio 4 and the 8000 the situation is different. Smooth scrolling and panning is in effect. Multitouch is disabled, but the buttons for zooming in and out work well and the interface is very fast. So why can't I suggest the Appradio 4 or the 8000?

3. See edit. Have not seen a truly bad NEX Display, but all but the most expensive machine are resistive touch. Color accuracy and gradient quality are still an issue but brightness is good.  Leaving original comment in parenthesis. (Pioneer displays are pure crap. Unless you go all the way up to the 8000 expect piss poor display quality. This is what my 4000 looks like in direct sunlight. http://imgur.com/yQloYG2 utterly useless.) The Appradio 4 is even worse. The display has terrible light bleed, incredibly inaccurate colors, and costs 600 dollars MSRP! So if you pay for your iPhone twice you can have carplay and hate your radio display all at the same time. Sure, if you jump up to the 8000 NEX you get a decent display. Still not as good as the iPhone powering it, but a good display. You only have to pay $1400 MSRP for a headunit which as an apple user does nothing more than the 600 dollar Appradio 4. The alpine has as good of a display as the 8000 and costs far less, but again, you have gimped carplay controls. None of these displays can hold a candle to a 350 dollar iPad mini retina. That's the saddest part. It's not even close. Resolution? 800x480. Color accuracy? It does better than black and white? Blacks? That's a color sure. 

4. There are good aspects to these units. In the case of Pioneer, it has more inputs than I can count. The microphone audio quality is better than I expected from a car microphone. As a result siri is very accurate even with the top down at 70 miles per hour. That part was very impressive. Calls are clear, and any problems are often more AT&amp;amp;amp;T call quality than my radio's fault. Facetime audio calls are clear as a bell and my go to these days. 

In short. Don't buy an aftermarket radio yet. Wait. Especially since apple just released the MFi Specs for carplay someone will make a unit worth its stuff once companies realize that the display quality and getting apple to not gimp their radio are the numbers one and two factors they need to nail. 

Now where can carplay be better?

1. Let me create audio messages through carplay's interface. Not a clue why it can't do this right now. You can do it by grabbing your phone, and doing it from there, but this is serious low hanging fruit apple can add. Audio messages are practically tailor made to be for carplay. 

2. Let 3rd party maps apps in. Apple maps as an accurate map is not currently the case. I run into little mistakes all the time. If apple is worried about 3rd party maps apps distracting the driver, force them to use the maps interface with their data. So the waze app would look almost like the apple maps app, and be as restricted as the apple maps app, but have the waze guidance instead of apple's and waze traffic data. 

3. Let 3rd party apps use either Siri, or their own voice commands. 

4. Clean up Glitches. It's gotten a lot better recently but on 8.0 it was hilariously bad. This one is one of my favorites. http://imgur.com/krFB3z3 couldn't do anything. Had to restart carplay to get rid of the keyboard that showed up. No I wasn't trying to type something when this happened. Just all of a sudden had a new friend on my display. 

Overall I love Carplay. It is an amazingly well designed system and a better thought out implementation of a car infotainment than anything else I've ever used. I look forward to one day trying out Google in the Car, but that day isn't here yet.",120,389,2014-12-23,AAPL,0.03741587388018767,0.927890678246816,0.034693457186222076

apple,My experience with the new Kindle Fire HD Kids edition (and why I bought iPad minis instead),"My kids are 5 and 3.  My son (5) is the most technically capable between him and my daughter (thats what 2 more years of being alive gets you).  Both had been used to using my iPad to play games and watch Netflix so I thought it would be a good time to get them their own tablets. 

Along comes the Amazon Kindle Fire HD Kids edition.  I look at the specs and they are decent, but what sells me on them is that for just $149 you get 2 years free replacement (for anything) and 1 year of the new Amazon freetime.  This new ""Freetime"" gives you full access to tons of games, apps, books, and movies.  All unlimited.  With all these great features, we decided to go all in and get both kids Kindles.

I fully admit that I'm an iOS snob, but I really wanted to like these tablets. The add ons alone were worth any anxiety I had over using a different OS. Well, I returned them today and bought ipads for my kids.  The bugs in the kindle software were just too much for me.

First are profiles.  I really like that I can have a kids profile and an adult profile. However, the stupid thing is tied to the cloud and if I create a profile for my son and daughter on my amazon account then BOTH profiles show up on BOTH tablets. This confused the hell out of my daughter and led me to discover another annoying thing.  When you first turn on the Fire you get all these icons of apps and books, but in order to use them you have to tap them and then wait to download them.  Not too bad, but they are slow as hell to download and on top of that, when you install an app in one profile and then install it in the other profile, it eats up twice the space.  This becomes an issue because you only have 8GB of space.  This led to another bug.  When the space filled up, the WiFi turned off.  I tried to turn it back on, but the device said I needed to free up space. (Why I need data space for wifi, I don't know).  I deleted apps, but it never let me turn wifi back on.  It just kept throwing up the error about needing space.  So I factory reset it.  This fixed the problem.

I found another usability problem with profiles.  When I'm in the kids profile, if I want to switch, I just drag down from the top and select ""exit profile"".  This takes me back to the lock screen with all the profiles.  The weird thing is that when I'm in the ""master"" profile that has all the access to everything, the ""exit profile"" button isn't there.  I did not figure out any way to exit my profile except to hit the hardware lock screen button and then hit it again to bring up the lock screen.  Stupid.

Finally, the last straw was the most annoying one.  I bought these for road trips and other things where we'll be away from Wifi for a while.  Today in the car, my son found that he couldn't access the ""Apps"" button.  Everytime he pressed it, the screen would flash and it would dump him back to the main screen.  I took it, logged out of his account and into mine.  Everything worked.  So I tried to log back into his profile, but now discover that I can't.  It just won't let me.  Right about this time we pull into my driveway and te tablet connects to my home Wifi.  *Poof* It throws some notice about updating profiles and they all work again. From what I could tell, it wasn't letting my into my son's profile because it needed to hit the cloud to authenticate something. Pretty stupid requirement for a tablet that might not be connected all the time.

So after all this, I'm returning them and I got iPads.  I thought about getting androids, but I have at least $100 in kids apps from iTunes and I didn't want to have to rebuy them all.  The iPads are alot more expensive, but I know they'll work and are alot less buggy than the Fires.

tl;dr version: Kindle Fire Kids edition is a buggy tablet that doesn't work well offline.  Buy an iPad instead.",52,70,2014-12-25,AAPL,0.052862294018268585,0.915661633014679,0.03147605061531067

apple,The iOS Music app is awful. Here's what's wrong with it and what needs to be done to fix it. [Long Post],"I've been thinking about this for a while and I've come to the realization that the Music app is the single most poorly designed major piece of software in Apple's repertoire.

Not only has it not shown any advancement in years, but in many respects, it has actually taken a few steps back. I know that many others are extremely disappointed with it, so I decided to compile a list of what I see as the major issues that plague this app and what needs to be done to bring it up to the usual Apple standards.

1. **Up Next.** This one's a gimme. iTunes has allowed song queuing for a few years now, so it's time to bring it to iOS already. I hate how I can't select the next song to play without interrupting the current song.

2. **Shorter lists.** The introduction of artist images may be nice aesthetically, but it makes the scrollable list more than twice as long, meaning it takes longer to find what you're looking for. Also, within the Artists tab, put albums back in their own nested folders. When you have an artist with 10 albums, it's very annoying to have to do so much scrolling when you want to listen to something from the 8th or 9th album.

3. **Filters.** Cover Flow was useless if you had a large music library, but its replacement (the album cover grid) is no better. What they need is filters so you can customize what you're looking at, instead of having to sift through a giant grid of potentially thousands of album covers that is neither fast nor intuitive. 

4. **Tags.** This is the single most important point in this thread, in my opinion. Currently, the Music app still operates via the nested folder model that is decades old. You select a tab (ie. artists), and then drill down through the 'folders' until you find what you want. This is far too stationary and downright archaic. We need a more dynamic system for song selection. For example, let's say I'm in the mood to play long heavy metal songs that I love, I should be able to select *'heavy metal'*, *'5 stars'*, and *'over 7 minutes'*, and it will automatically populate a playlist of all the songs on my iPhone that meet those criteria. **In other words, what the Music app needs is dynamic playlists. Take the Smart Playlist feature that we've had for years, and instead of having these rigid playlists that you need to create and manage each time, implement a quick and intuitive filter system where you can choose the characteristics of whatever it is that you'd like to play, and it will immediately populate a playlist for you based on those characteristics.** And allow us to add our own tags to songs that this system can make use of. I really truly hope that the Beats acquisition brings a feature like this to the iOS Music app. **This is the single biggest feature I want to see in iOS 9.** If we don't see this sort of dynamic music selection process, I will be immensely disappointed.

5. **Fix the album view design.** In the days of iOS 1-6, album view was a neat little feature because it gave you the feeling of owning the physical album without actually having it. You would tap the icon and it would flip the album and show you the track list 'on the back'. Well, when iOS got rid of skeuomorphism, this metaphor was destroyed in the process. The album view is still there, but it doesn't mean anything. There's no digital representation of a physical album, yet when you tap the icon on the top right of the screen, you see the track list slide up from the bottom. This track list looks just like the normal song selection screen, which is extremely confusing and often causes you to lose your place within the app. By getting rid of the physicality but retaining the feature, iOS has increased the cognitive load by adding an additional layer of confusion to the Music app.

6. Speaking of the album view, why does the 'Ratings' button even exist? All it does is display the star rating of the current song that's playing. If I'm already playing the song, why do I need to see the rating? Sure, it allows you to edit it, but so what? The purpose of star ratings is to make the song selection process easier. I'd rather play a 4* or 5* song than a 1* song, so I want to be able to see the star ratings BEFORE I play the song to remind me of what I love and what I don't. As such, either show all the star ratings in the list, or don't show any of them. Displaying the rating of just the song that's currently playing is pointless.

7. **Larger touch targets.** I don't know about you, but I find the touch targets for music controls are way too small and often unresponsive. For example, the vertical alphabet along the right side of the screen is far too narrow. The touch target feels like it's just a couple millimeters wide, so whenever I go to touch it, I end up hitting the empty white space beside it and selecting the artist rather than scrolling to that letter. Make the column wider or find a better mechanism to scroll through the alphabet. Additionally, I find the lock screen music controls are unresponsive. When you're on the move and are listening to music, you want to be able to quickly hit the Pause/Forward/Backward buttons without even having to think about it. You really can't do that, though. I find that they're too small, and iOS often registers my touches as accidental touches that it dismisses, rather than real user inputs. This needs to be adjusted to allow for greater leniency, so that when I'm walking somewhere and want to pause or change the track, I don't have to be so incredibly precise and attentive.

8. **Misc.** Create some sort of adaptive colour UI, like we see in iTunes and in the iOS Remote app. It's quite nice and I know a lot of people prefer this to the Music app's current colour scheme.


Here are a few additional bugs/glitches/inconsistencies/poor design choices that I've noticed:

* The app always forgets your place. I don't know if this is due to the lack of RAM, but I'm getting annoyed at how every time I open the Music app, it forgets where I was and returns me back to the top of the artist list.

* Spotlight is inconsistent. Sometimes I'll type in the name of a song and it'll find it immediately, whereas other times, it will be blank, even though I *know* the song is there.

* There needs to be a better way to toggle the 'Show All Music' option. I have iTunes Match because I like having access to all my music everywhere, but I usually don't want it all showing because it makes lists longer and more unwieldy. So when I want to listen to something that isn't currently on my phone, I have to go into Settings, locate the 'Show All Music' toggle, turn it on, go back into the Music app, download the song or album, wait for the download to complete, then go back into Settings and turn off 'Show All Music'. There needs to be a better way.

* Fix bugs. For example, half the time, 'Create -&gt; Genius Playlist' causes the app to freeze. Also, I still notice glitches sometimes when switching between portrait and landscape.

* General inconsistencies. For example, why is it that when you tap an artist, the albums are listed in reverse chronological order, whereas when you type that same artist into the search field at the top and then select that artist, it lists the albums alphabetically? That's just careless design.

* Missing designs and affordances. For example, within the 'Playlists' tab,  you have no way of knowing what's a playlist and what's a folder that has playlists within it.


Sorry for such a long post, but there's a lot to say on the matter. Agree? Disagree? I hope my post doesn't come across as bitter. I'm an enormous iOS fan and I love *most* of Apple's apps. But I consider myself an enormous music fan, and the Music app is among my top 3 most used apps in iOS 8. That's why these issues are so frustrating to me. I've tried alternative apps that alleviate some of the issues, but they all seem to introduce some of their own. And the single most important feature here (**#4 on the list**) can only be created with a first party solution, so that's why Apple needs to get on it.

What are your thoughts on the matter?",118,182,2014-12-26,AAPL,0.06587252207100391,0.9076151251792908,0.026512306183576584
apple,4 years ago my 6th gen iPod nano took a trip through the washing machine and dryer. Today I fixed it.,"I know Apple gets criticism for how non-repairable some of their products are.  However, I'm pretty impressed that I was able to fix a 4 year old ipod that I thought was completely destroyed.  Pictures and story here:

apple,Silent changes to EarPods?,"As per title, were there silent changes to the EarPods between their debut in 2012 and now?

My original pair that came with my iPhone 5 finally died (one side was significantly softer than the other despite regular cleaning), so I bought a new pair.

Right out of the box, some things seemed different about this new pair compared to my old pair and all other EarPods I've used prior to the new pair:

1. Made of ""harder"" material to the touch. The new pair felt like the casing of the iPhone 5c.

2. Shape seemed different. My old pair fit very snugly in my ears while the new pair feels like it has A LOT of wiggle room.

3. New pair is **significantly louder** than the old pair. With my old pair I usually had my volume slider at around 12/16 clicks (75%) while listening to music. With this new pair I have the volume set around 8/16 (50%) to achieve roughly the same loudness.

4. The frequency reproduction is massively different between the old and new pair. The old par had a more balanced sound, with a slightly flubby low end and a minor bump in the low-midrange. The new pair has a ridiculous exaggeration of the high end but a much tighter low end.

Did I somehow end up with a defective/fake pair, or was there a silent change to the overall design of the EarPods?

TL;DR bought new EarPods to replace old dying pair, new pair is ***very*** different.

EDIT: I should probably clarify that I bought the new pair from an Authorized Apple Reseller, and that I've always used my old pair around 12/16 (75%) volume since the day I got it.

Also, after further testing I've noticed that there's quite a bit of crackling in the new EarPods while listening to songs that I'm already familiar with (these songs shouldn't have any crackling at all).
