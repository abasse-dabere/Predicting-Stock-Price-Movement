apple,Upgrading to iOS 11 has made my phone barely usable at times,"The versions of iOS have always been fine for me in the past, just with minor bugs. iOS 11 is by FAR the worst upgrade for me, here's my experiences:

- Huge increase in the rate of apps and the whole OS freezing. This used to happen very occasionally on iOS 10 but now it‚Äôs happening several times a day and is incredible irritating, especially when I need to just quickly check my phone for something and it ends up taking maybe 5 minutes instead of 5 seconds by the time my phone reboots etc.
- Volume controls don‚Äôt work. Sometime they do, but usually not. This is both for the buttons and headphone controls. I am currently getting around this by using the control centre. However, I can‚Äôt change the ringer volume this way so I have no way other than going into the settings every time I want to adjust that.
- When I have music playing on Spotify, on the control centre it still shows controls for the ‚Äòmusic‚Äô app. This, combined with the headphone controls not working, means the only way I can pause/skip etc is to go into the actual app each time. 
- Huge delays when I press buttons. For example ocassionally when I press pause or control the volume from my headphones it will decide to work, but only do what I wanted after a huge delay. 
- After turning airplane mode on then back off, Bluetooth is now even if it wasn‚Äôt before I turned airplane mode on. But I understand this could be intentional? 


I really hope apple will fix these bugs asap. I've experienced many others but these are just the ones most annoying.

Video: https://youtu.be/aawlU1IzuqI

Click here for the [iPhone 8 Plus Charging Speed chart](https://i.imgur.com/lfNWull.png) from the video.

With a 15 minute charge difference between 12W and 29W chargers with the iPhone 8 Plus I'd only upgrade when I have an iPad Pro. 

iPad Pros [benefit more from the fast charging](https://www.macstories.net/ios/testing-apples-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-and-ipad-pro-fast-charging/) than iPhones.

What I got from this test:

* Wait for Anker to come out with a USB-C to Lightning cable. Their current PowerLine cables are known for their durability and are cheaper compared to Apple's cables.

* Wait for 3rd party USB-C chargers with USB PD that have more than 1 port so you can plug your iPhone 8, iPad Pro and Mac notebooks using only 1 charger.

I've been using 3rd party 12W car and wall chargers with my 2015 iPhone 6s and 2013 iPad Air and they are worlds apart faster than the bundled 5W charger.",189,344.0,2017-10-03,AAPL,0.02530985325574875,0.9281282424926758,0.046561866998672485

apple,"Android user for 7 years, first time iOS user. Thoughts","I've been using Android since 2010, last phone being Google Pixel. I preordered the Pixel 2 XL and have been using an SE for a month now after I sold my Pixel 1. I've used only Google phones for at least 5 years now and I would consider myself a Google fanboy. That being said, I still wanted to give iOS and iPhone a fair try and hence have been using the SE as my daily driver. I've used iOS 11 since day 1 and this is also my first time using any iOS device. Please feel free to correct me if something I say is wrong. I am not here to start wars, I just want to give my views as someone who's only ever used Android.

I'll start with what I **like** over Android
  
- **Battery life**. It is really really good. While my Pixel would get me through the day I would charge it fully if I am going out in the evening. It's just so unpredictable on Android. You never know when an app would decide to go rogue. Also, if I take too many pictures, the battery drains quickly. I didn't face any such problems and had my peace of mind that the battery is easily going to last me a whole day. It's overall much more stable.
  
- **Sticky lists**. I like that how easy it is to act on lists. On Android I end up swiping them away trying to perform a swipe action. Notifications is the biggest culprit. 
  
- **Apps**. All apps feel like they're part of the OS. The animations are slick. 
 
- **iMessage** is really nice. While I don't text often and use other messenger apps, whenever I do, it's an enjoyable experience. While texting from laptop is available on most messengers, being able to use SMS the same is really cool.
  
- **TouchID**. While the sensor itself is not the fastest, I love that it's on the front. I don't need to pick it up when it's on my desk for example. 

What I **don't like**
  
- **Notifications**. They suck. They're not bundled together per app? Why? Important notifications get buried if there are a 100 messages from a group chat. Also, Notification panel and Lock screen are the same thing, but I cannot dismiss them in the same way? Maybe I'm so used to Android and people don't get rid of the notification panel by swiping up but it's just confusing to someone using it for the first time. 
  
- **Control center**. It feels inferior to the Android offering. I still need to open settings to connect to a new WiFi network/BT device. And I can't count the number of times I would accidentally open it while scrolling. I eventually had to disable it in apps. Apple really should have made swipe down from top right the standard way to open it. 
  
- **Settings**. This might not be an issue for someone already used to the settings, but do you guys think everything is organized properly? For example, WiFi calling, LTE are under the main setting 'Mobile Data'. Shouldn't it be named something more general like 'Cellular Services'? When I first wanted to disable LTE, I didn't realize it would be there. 
  
- **DND**. again feels weak. No automatic rules for calendar events. I rely on this for work meetings and hate turning it on manually. 
  
- **Universal sign in**. Most apps don't have Google/Facebook sign in? I remember at least Facebook sign in used to be a thing. This is extra annoying since I use 2 factor authentication on both and it takes so much more time to sign in.   

- **Car Play**. It's never worked reliably for me. Sometimes the car buttons won't work. Sometimes I won't get the now playing screen at all. Siri won't work most of the time. One thing to note here is I use GPM for my music and have disabled Apple Music. That might be causing issues but Siri not working seems unrelated. 
  
- **Other inconsistencies**. 
 * There's no standard way to close keyboard in apps. Some apps would require swiping down on area above keyboard, some would require a tap. It's just annoying.
  - Same with in app navigation. To go up in the app, some apps need a swipe right from left edge, some swipe right from anywhere on the screen while some won't handle swipe right at all. If I don't want to rely on swipe gesture to go back, there's no standard button to do that either.
  - Pulling down the notification panel gives an impression that it's dropping over the wallpaper/home screen, but pulling up the control center happens over the app. It's very minor and maybe not noticeable to someone who's not used to Material design. 
  - Going back to previous app seems like an afterthought. While it's almost always that I want to use that button, it still seems like such an odd place to put it.

Again, I'm not here to start wars. I would genuinely like to know if all these things are issues for you guys as well. If there's a better way to do things that I didn't like, please tell me. While I can't imagine myself moving full time to an iOS device till the time Google keeps making phones, I would still like to improve my experience as I wait for my Pixel 2 XL to arrive.",115,278.0,2017-10-08,AAPL,0.0494236359372735,0.8989090919494629,0.05166728142648935

apple,iPhone X Live Wallpapers,"Thank you /r/Apple mods for approving this post!

So I made several, specifically 8, live wallpapers from the iPhone X intro video. They are really pretty cool. All done in FCPX and converted via the intoLive app (not a sponsor). The issue is that I can't share them directly (yet) without giving up the ""Live"" portion of the Live Photo.

Long story short here is how you can get them if you're willing.

A) Join my iPhone Wallpaper Album Shared Stream and get them automatically along with like 1,000 other wallpapers. Just PM me your Apple ID and I can send an invite. Here is link to preview the album. https://goo.gl/AZvS6C


B) Search for me on the Imgur app, dfshrmn, and save the gifs (they really are videos) from my iPhone X album then convert via the app intoLive.


C) Open the Google Drive or Imgur link below ON YOUR MAC/PC, save the ones you want or the .zip file in Google Drive &amp; unzip (lol), airdrop the videos to your iPhone (or cloud upload from PC), and then convert via the app intoLive.

apple,"Apple, thank you for finally updating the podcasts app! These are all the changes I've been dreaming of!","For years the Apple podcast app has been an underserviced, underdeveloped buggy mess. Episodes would randomly not download, daily podcasts would stop updating if you didn't listen to them for two weeks, it was really just not a great app.

But today, I opened my app and all the things I've wanted changed have been changed! Well, not the ones I mentioned earlier, but other ones.

Before, when you clicked on a podcast episode the app, unexpectedly, would just start *playing* the episode (What!?). I mean, what kind of garbage UI is that?? Who opens a podcast app to listen to podcast? Apple *finally* listened to its userbase and fixed that dumb bug, so now, when you click on an episode, it takes you to the information about that episode, and from that screen you can hit the play button (who would even do that?). I know that for the longest time I wanted to read about my podcasts and not listen to them, so this is a welcome change.

Another huge improvement is that the podcasts no longer get stored in that dumb list format. That was so ridiculous. So what, I just scroll through my alphabetized list and click the one I want? Who the hell has the alphabet memorized!? Thank God they changed that, so now it's just a grid with no apparent order. It's also absolutely fantastic that they moved that grid so that it's an extra click away. That way I can click ""Library"" *then* click ""shows."" The old way of taking me to my library when I clicked library was ridiculous.

Sure, some detractors might say ""Hey, why didn't you make it so that when one episode finishes it plays the next one from the same show?"" or ""I can't believe the update doubles the number of clicks to get to the podcast I want"" or ""I really wish podcasts that are only available for one week wouldn't randomly stop updating, thereby missing hours of podcasts permanently"" or ""Wow, Siri interaction seems completely broken with this new podcast app."" But those idiots are just a bunch of negative Nancies.

This focus on making sure the users have to press a lot more buttons to accomplish the same thing is just the best. Keep up the great work, Apple!",102,377.0,2017-10-11,AAPL,0.06369893252849579,0.9069344997406006,0.02936660684645176

apple,If you're on the fence about buying AirPods: Just do it,"I just got mine. But them used because I have a hard time throwing that much money at something I can potentially easily lose, but I'm *seriously* impressed by them.

The sound quality is good enough, and definitely better than the earbuds. I feel like the bass response is considerably better.

They're also more comfortable than the earbuds, due to *maybe* being shaped slightly different, and not having the weight of the cable pulling down. I'm been using them for quite a few hours in a row now, and there's been no discomfort whatsoever. I've yet to work out with them, though.

I was afraid of them falling out of my ears, but I tried shaking my head as much as I could (certainly MUCH more than I ever would in a real situation), and they stayed in place pretty well. I've also tried tapping them on the stem, in different directions, and they sit pretty tight, unless I tap them from the bottom (obviously).  This will vary from person to person, of course.

But the great thing is about how convenient they are and how well they work! The double-tapping works really well (once you get the hang of it), they connect so easily and seamlessly, that it almost seems unnatural. When I put one down in the case, the other switches to mono, and the charging is really quick.

My only complaint is that the microphones seem to be mediocre, and definitely worse than my iPhone microphone, but it still does the job.

Honestly, had I known how great these are, I would've bought them at full price a month ago, when I bought my iPhone.

Edit: Oh yeah, not being to properly control sound volume is also a bummer. I just don't notice it much, because I've mostly used headphones with in-line controls.",229,501.0,2017-10-12,AAPL,0.030044322833418846,0.9094423651695251,0.06051336228847504

apple,I did a tech demo for Tim Cook earlier this week,"I've spent the last couple of days thinking about whether I should write something up for this sub. I was slightly concerned that it might come off a little self-congratulatory, but I figured some of you would get a kick out of it so here we are. To be honest, I'm not sure exactly which details you'll find interesting, so I'll just tell the story and feel free to ask me any questions.

For a little background, this was my first week doing a DPhil (PhD) in Engineering Science at Oxford after having finished my undergrad degree in the same department this summer. My masters project was titled ""Exploring Indoor Environments for Augmented Reality"" and my DPhil is now in Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). SLAM is a cornerstone technology for AR and so I have very much stayed in the same field.

Anyway, you may have seen the videos of Tim Cook visiting Oxford for the opening of the Oxford Foundry this week. Since Tim is massively into AR at the moment, my supervisor and I were asked to put on a little demo at the event for him to show some of the stuff being worked on at the university.

I was obviously slightly nervous, but I assumed that there would be plenty of demos and he would only spend a passing moment looking at what we had been working on. When we arrived at the event however, it turned out that we were the only two demoing for the post-talk, VIP-only drinks and canap√©s. I was bricking it.

This meant that I got to have a pretty much one-on-one conversation with Tim for about 15 minutes, talking about my work, AR in general etc. (with his PA asking him to wrap up the whole time haha)

I don't remember everything we talked about but I can tell you about some of the things that stuck out:

- I was incredibly surprised about the obvious knowledge Tim had about the topic. I had expected to be asked high-level questions about what we were doing, but Tim was asking down to the gritty detail about everything (such as how the particular depth camera we were using worked).

- He is just as calm and well mannered as you would expect from seeing him in interviews and on camera. He made an effort to be engaged about what you were talking about and to show that he was listening to what you had to say.

- He was quite playful and funny. There was a thank you speech to all the donors which was taking far too long, but he slowly crept across the room to our demo during the speech and was even whispering a few jokes while it was still going on.

This was honestly one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I only currently have a selfie (https://imgur.com/a/ekVFT) to prove it, but I am hoping I can get the pictures from the event photographer because I saw him taking quite a few in the corner of my eye.

apple,I've had more crashes/bugs/freezes/frame drops with iOS 11 in 3 weeks than in a YEAR with my iPhone 7 on iOS 10 :/.,"I usually know it‚Äôs expected the first versions of a new iOS will not work well as it needs fine tuning (which only really happens on x.1). And I really wasn‚Äôt that bothered with iOS 11 on my iPhone 7 until these last few weeks. I can say now the 11 has the MOST bugs than all other iOS‚Äô versions I‚Äôve used since my iPhone 5... unfortunately. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing:

- Crashes + device freezes with multiple apps. Both Apple‚Äôs (Safari) and third-party ones. The ones that uses location services (e.g. Tinder) are really suffering a lot, but I'm having inexplicable crashes with really lightweight/simple apps and tasks, such as opening the Telephone app.

- Frame-drops when 3D-Touching anything. From apps on homescreen to links on Reddit app, whenever I peek-and-pop something (3d touch it) there are bizarre frame drops, from 60fps to like 10-15fps.

- MANY visual glitches. From keyboard becoming blue on Instagram to app icons‚Äô going off the folders when scrolling trough them, the amount of visual glitches on iOS 11 is crazy.

- Sluggishness when opening folders. Specially those which have many apps. It simply takes more time to open them than it did on iOS 10. For no reason.

- A little worse battery life on daily usage.

Dear Apple, 

Why does an incoming call take up the entire fucking screen while my device is in use? Can I please have an optional persistent banner notification for incoming calls? Or at a very minimum and possibly more complicated, while keyboard is up. 

Thank you. 

edit: i've seen a few suggestions for DND mode. What if it's a call that I want to take? The current state is just not flexible. I want my cake and will eat it too.  Besides, my sisters phone lives on DND, i just call her twice.

edit2: i feel like the poker story is throwing people off. If i'm sending an imessage and i'm in the flow of typing (title) and i get a call, i'm either pressing answer or decline. My fingers were already in motion. I just happened to be playing a game this time.

apple,The CPUs in new iPhones are 373% faster than in 2013. The CPUs in new MacBook Pros are only 13% faster. Details inside.,"While I knew that mobile CPUs had been advancing much faster than their desktop counterparts, I never fully realized just how massive that difference has been in recent years. Until today.

Here's some numbers, comparing 2013 vs 2017 CPUs in two Apple lineups: 

Device | CPU (single core) | CPU (multi core)
---|---|----
iPhone 5S (late 2013) | 1268 | 2133
iPhone 8 (late 2017) | 4205 | 10006
MacBook Pro 15"" (late 2013) | 4169 | 13893
MacBook Pro 15"" (mid 2017) | 4649 | 15665

iPhone's CPU became 232% faster at single core and 373% faster at multi core tasks during those 4 years.

MacBook Pro 15"" top-of-the-line CPU became only 12% faster at single core and 13% faster at multi core tasks during those 4 years.

So, if you were wondering why you're excited to get a new iPhone while your 2013 laptop seems perfectly fine, there's your answer. The difference truly is staggering.

apple,iOS 11 is the buggiest i have ever seen any of my iphones,"I‚Äôm curious as to how often you guys experience these bugs because they are honestly infuriating and remind me of having an android. 

First annoying bug which happens way too often, when i answer a phone call, i cannot head the other person and they can not hear me. When this bug starts happening, it doesn‚Äôt fix until i reset my phone. another part of this bug is whenever i try to make a phone call, it will not ring. and when i try to adjust the volume on the phone call the volume slider does not show up. very annoying especially since i can‚Äôt just try making the phone call again, i have to restart 

another very annoying bug is, half the time, more often than not actually, the music won‚Äôt show up on the lock screen, preventing me from changing the volume anywhere outside of the actual app playing the media, wether it be the podcast app, soundcloud, spotify, etc. this one sometimes fixes without me resetting my phone but i usually have to reset for this to fix 

the last most universal bug is my phone will freeze up like crazy so many times through out the day, for a couple minutes at a time and seemingly randomly. very annoying. 

how common are all three of these issues for anyone else? the freezing one i guess i can kind of forgive but the other two drive me absolutely crazy, especially considering i have an iphone 7 plus",2041,9220.0,2017-10-18,AAPL,0.1486554592847824,0.8309295773506165,0.02041492611169815

apple,"iOS 11 flashlight no longer works under 15% battery. Apple's solution: use the screen for light, sucking battery 10x as fast.","This has to be one of the dumbest decisions Apple has made.

There are far *worse* decisions. Far worse goofs. But this one is probably one of the stupidest, because it has ONLY ONE reason to do it (save battery), and the 'solution' has the EXACT OPPOSITE effect.

Somebody at Apple (probably several somebodies) made the conscious decision to save battery life by disabling the flashlight when the battery is under 15%.

So, at the end of almost every day, instead of using my flashlight, which I can no longer do, Apple's solution is for me to use my screen for light.

Which drains the battery WAY faster, and is WAY less effective.

Come on Apple. FFS.

TL;DR: The decision to save battery by cutting a super-useful feature at the end of the day (when you most need it) results in users draining their battery much faster.

---

Edit: ~~It seems so far that Pluses are unaffected by this 'feature'.~~ Wrong, pluses are affected. It seems it's older phones though...

Edit 2: I suspect it's a battery protection 'feature' for rougher condition batteries. It has come on suddenly, likely because this is a new condition being tested for in iOS 11.

Edit 3: Frequently Asked Questions

- Low power mode isn't on.
- Camera or camera-using apps are not causing this (light will shut off if battery dips below 15% with the screen off)
- Can't change flashlight intensity, flashlight button is disabled in the interface below 15%.
- Temperature is not a cause. We can consistently trigger the behaviour at the 15%, not plugged in threshold.
- Hard rebooting (even upgrading to 11.0.3) does nothing to this 'feature'.
- I am not an android spy, nor I suspect are the others having this problem.

Edit 4: Because so many people are saying nobody else is having this problem. Here are the folks **just in this thread** who've said it's happening to them:

apple,iPhone Upgrade Program/Preorder Questions Mega-thread,"Hey /r/apple!

With less than X days for the iPhone X (See what I did there? I will get out the door once I'm done with this post.), there has been an increase of questions about the iPhone X, buying questions, and etcetera that you guys want answered in preparation for next week.

Please use this mega-thread to ask any questions about the pre-order process, the iPhone Upgrade Program, and anything else you would like to know before the big day.

Any questions that could be asked here will be removed and users will be directed to this thread.

Here is some quick info about the iPhone Upgrade Program (referred to as IUP henceforth):

* The bank Apple uses for the IUP is Citizens One (US). Barclays in the UK. 

* Here is a table for the prices of the current iPhones (US Price). 


iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus | iPhone X
---|---|----
$34.50/month (64GB)| $39.50/month (64GB) | $49.91/month (64GB)
$40.75/month (256GB) | $45.75/month (256GB) | $56.16/month (256GB)


* AppleCare+ is included in the program

* You can use IUP online for Sprint, Verizon and AT&amp;T. T-Mobile users have to go to an Apple Store to get on the IUP. UK users don't need to specify their carriers. 

* You‚Äôre eligible to upgrade to a new iPhone once you‚Äôve made 12 payments. 

* The program is available only in the United States, United Kingdom and China

I did have seven useless albums, but deleted the two created by Twitter and Snapchat. Something I have to do every so often because I can't figure out how to stop them from creating more albums. And when I deleted those albums, guess what? The photos remained in my camera roll - rendering those albums completely pointless.

I guess I could give the Places album a pass since you can see photos of one place you may frequent often, but how often do you *actually* use it for that purpose?

apple,Securing an iPhone X Pre-Order: The Complete Guide,"Hello everyone,

I know many of these guides have been around previously, and I wanted to shed some light on some less known tricks to make sure we all gain a slight advantage when it comes to pre-ordering. 

Some of these may be more obvious than others, and they are listed in no particular order, but they are all crucial since we know there will be supply constraints.

Without further ado, here is the complete list:


* Be there on time, which is 3:01am EDT/12:01 PDT on October 27th. Set an alarm if you don‚Äôt plan on staying up late


* The best way to pre-order is the Apple Store App, preferably on your fastest device and with a solid internet connection. Force quitting the app and re-opening it constantly seems to be the quickest way to access the store


* If you own multiple devices, use them to your advantage (example: Apple Store open on your iPad that‚Äôs connected to wifi, and your phone on LTE in case your home internet cuts out)


* Have your credit card and shipping address filled out in the app. This is imperative, you don‚Äôt want to be scrambling for your credit card or inputting your address during this pressing time. A difference of 1 minute can be the difference in weeks/months when it comes to receiving the product


* On the same note, make sure your Apple Wallet is ready with your credit/debit and your address. Apple Pay/Wallet is the fastest way to check out


* Favorite the phone you want on the Apple Store App. You can do so right now in the shop tab. It‚Äôll appear under the ‚Äúaccount‚Äù tab when you are done tapping the heart in the top right corner after you‚Äôve chosen your specifications


* Do a test run. Make sure all of the above is completed and ready to go, then go ahead and try to order any random product. Don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt have to complete an order, just make sure you get to Apple Pay/checkout and that all the details in the process, like your shipping address are correct. I went as far as practicing this enough to reduce the overall process of the duration by 10 seconds


* Think about the color/capacity you want and how much it matters to you. The most sought after version of the iPhone X is likely to be the 64GB space grey model. Luckily for me, I‚Äôll be going for the 256GB Silver model, which is likely to be the least popular model of the X. Take these into consideration



I hope this is helpful to some of you, and I wish you all the best of luck!

apple,"Introducing Apollo, a brand new Reddit experience for iOS. Gorgeous, iOS centric design, an incredible Media Viewer, fully customizable gestures, a full Markdown editor, and sculpted by thousands of Redditors.","Hey!

For the last almost three years, I've been developing a brand new Reddit app for iOS called Apollo. I used to work at Apple, and since then I took what I learned and built Apollo from the ground up to look and feel like a gorgeous Reddit experience that is distinctly iOS, following the design guidelines Apple put forth, to almost envision what Reddit would look like if Apple themselves built a Reddit app, with all the power, speed and flexibility you could possibly want.

**Download link:** https://itunes.apple.com/app/apollo-reddit-client/id979274575?mt=8

**Trailer:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKbPZVDg-Z8

I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/) a few years back, and literally thousands of awesome Redditors joined the beta program to help sculpt the best Reddit experience possible and form Apollo into what it is today. So much of the feedback fundamentally transformed Apollo beyond what I could have done or foreseen myself.

It's available for download for free, and I'd love for you all to check it out if you have the chance (and send me feedback over in r/ApolloApp if you have any!). Fundamentally, I focused on giving it a gorgeous iOS design, with a really powerful Media Viewer, incredible comments experince, a full Markdown editor, fully customizable gestures, and so much more. It's insanely powerful, while also maintaining a really clean, simple design.

Again, your feedback would be monumental. This is just the beginning for Apollo, and really hope I can keep building onto it for a long time coming with even more incredible features.

### Questions

##### Why build it? There's already Reddit apps.
While there are some nice ones, nothing exactly scratched my itch as to what a Reddit client could really achieve on iOS. Alien Blue came close, but still had a UI that especially once iOS 7 launched felt outdated and somewhat out of place on iOS. Android also has some really great clients, but I just think the experience on iOS has been lacking and is due for something to really show what Reddit on iOS can be. I built Apollo with the goal of not just being the best Reddit experience on iOS, but the best Reddit experience *period*.

##### What's wrong with the official Reddit app?
Nothing, if you're happy, great! Reddit has a lot of really smart people on it. For me, however, I'm not a fan of how they're trying to get one central look across iOS and Android, I really think an iOS app should look and feel like an iOS app, and an Android app should respect Material Design. I think designing for the middle results in a clunky experience where the potential of both platforms is never realized to the fullest. Apollo is an iOS app period, built to take advantage of iOS features and feel like a beautiful, familiar iOS app. I also think they discontinued Alien Blue without incorporating the best parts of it that people loved the most, such as the minimal, uncluttered UI (Alien Blue was much more compact and concise), as well as powerful features like swipe to collapse comments, full screen, inline previews for links in comments, etc. Apollo has all that and more, because I think it's essential part of browsing on iOS.

##### I'm still using Alien Blue, why use Apollo?
I can say without question Alien Blue was an incredible app, I loved it. But it's very clearly not being taken care of anymore. If you plan to get an iPhone X, it won't even display properly and will have black bars at the top. For everyone else, it's simply not getting updates or being maintained properly, and it's obviously got worse and worse. Imgur links don't work that well anymore, Reddit's own content links certainly don't, more and more things are stopping loading. Lots of new features of Reddit are missing (and even some old goodies, like multireddits) too. I really built Apollo with the power of Alien Blue in mind, I think if you're a fan of Alien Blue you'll feel right at home in Apollo.

##### It's free? How do you make money/expect it to survive?
I more or less just copied how Alien Blue did it, where it's free to download and use forever (with no ads), and you can unlock a ""Pro"" version in the app for $2.99 that unlocks some extra features like submitting posts (same as Alien Blue did), automatic dark mode, customizing gestures, customizing the app icon, and a bunch more. I mean, I'd love to give out everything for free, but I can't afford to compete with a billion dollar company like Reddit. I'm just one guy in an apartment with an awesome girlfriend and [two cute cats](https://i.imgur.com/7dKJs2n.jpg), and obviously need some form of revenue in the app to sustain me being able to build the app at all and give it a healthy future. Choosing *which* features to include in Pro is obviously hard, but I thought Alien Blue [set a good standard](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1i2fe4/im_trying_to_convince_a_friend_to_get_pro/) with its unlockable features, which allowed it to have a healthy, long-ish life. I hope that's understandable, I just really want to be able to keep building onto this app for a long time coming.

##### Does it have ads?
No, no ads anywhere.

##### iPad app?
Yep, it's a universal app! I have awesome plans to really bring it further and to the next level on iPads as well.

##### Available everywhere?
Yes! International, baby!

##### What are your plans for Apollo for the future?
A lot. :) I have a ton of things I want to build for Apollo, from an even better, super-powered iPad app, to even more powerful content filtering, more moderator features, full comment search, etc. My plan is to have users vote on which features they want to see the most, and I'll work on those, so it'll become even more of a Reddit app for Redditors, by Redditors.

If you have any more I'm more than happy to answer them! I'll be at my keyboard all day until I've answered everything or my wrists fall off. EDIT: Oh boy, you all are hard to keep up with. I will answer every question though if it takes me weeks!

For everyone else, it's simply not getting updates or being maintained properly, and it's obviously got worse and worse. Imgur links don't work that well anymore, Reddit's own content links certainly don't, more and more things are stopping loading. Lots of new features of Reddit are missing (and even some old goodies, like multireddits) too. I really built Apollo with the power of Alien Blue in mind, I think if you're a fan of Alien Blue you'll feel right at home in Apollo.

##### It's free? How do you make money/expect it to survive?
I more or less just copied how Alien Blue did it, where it's free to download and use forever (with no ads), and you can unlock a ""Pro"" version in the app for $2.99 that unlocks some extra features like submitting posts (same as Alien Blue did), automatic dark mode, customizing gestures, customizing the app icon, and a bunch more. I mean, I'd love to give out everything for free, but I can't afford to compete with a billion dollar company like Reddit. I'm just one guy in an apartment with an awesome girlfriend and [two cute cats](https://i.imgur.com/7dKJs2n.jpg), and obviously need some form of revenue in the app to sustain me being able to build the app at all and give it a healthy future. Choosing *which* features to include in Pro is obviously hard, but I thought Alien Blue [set a good standard](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1i2fe4/im_trying_to_convince_a_friend_to_get_pro/) with its unlockable features, which allowed it to have a healthy, long-ish life. I hope that's understandable, I just really want to be able to keep building onto this app for a long time coming.

##### Does it have ads?
No, no ads anywhere.

##### iPad app?
Yep, it's a universal app! I have awesome plans to really bring it further and to the next level on iPads as well.

##### Available everywhere?
Yes! International, baby!

##### What are your plans for Apollo for the future?
A lot. :) I have a ton of things I want to build for Apollo, from an even better, super-powered iPad app, to even more powerful content filtering, more moderator features, full comment search, etc. My plan is to have users vote on which features they want to see the most, and I'll work on those, so it'll become even more of a Reddit app for Redditors, by Redditors.

If you have any more I'm more than happy to answer them! I'll be at my keyboard all day until I've answered everything or my wrists fall off. EDIT: Oh boy, you all are hard to keep up with. I will answer every question though if it takes me weeks!

iphone,"Was set to pre-order the iphone X, had a complete change of heart.","I've been a huge iphone fan for years and was waiting patiently to upgrade my 7. The iphone X looks incredible and I was set to drop the cash and pre-order at 3am last night.

Then I had a personal revelation.

Why am I about to spend 1500$ on a phone that will cost me another 1500$ in fees per year? I could be doing so many better things with that money. I could be travelling, investing, engaging in experiences. I've spent thousands in the past few years on owning a smartphone that frankly doesn't give me much pleasure anymore. In realizing that, I decided I'm going to use the money I would have spent on some personal improvements (I've wanted lasik eye surgery my whole life). And I'm using this to try to get away from my addiction with using phones. Before this, I'd spend hours a day mindlessly scrolling through apps on my phone. I've had enough, and I'm ready to get away from this cycle to start enjoying my time and money.

I called my carrier this morning and cancelled my plan. I'm in the process of moving to a pay-as-you go with Public Mobile (Canada) to pay half of what I used to pay. I'm keeping a minimal amount of data for important things like GPS, but otherwise my new plan will be extremely limited.

No shame to anyone buying the new phones or people who enjoy these things as a hobby; I totally get it. But I want to hear if anyone has had similar thoughts.

apple,iPhone X: Qualcomm vs. Intel - Battery Life &amp; Real World Implications (Long/Technical),"As with the iPhone 7 and 8, Apple has two different SKUs of the iPhone X, A1865 for Qualcomm and A1901 for Intel. While the press has mostly focused on theoretical speed differences between the two, let's instead look at potential real world differences. Before we get there, some background:

Apple while an innovator when it comes to SoC, camera design, supply chain, vertical integration, and smartphones in general, has been extremely conservative with regards to the cellular/RF side of the house. Apple has typically used a 1-1.5 generation old (when compared with Android devices) RF stack, whether it's for design, price or other reasons. As a result Apple has been late to the game or still hasn't enabled technologies like 3G, LTE, VoLTE, Wifi calling, EVS, HPUE, LTE-A, LTE-U/LAA, advanced antenna designs enabling 4x4 MIMO, etc.

So why this matter?

While the press talks about *omgz Gigabit LTE is so much faster than 450Mbps LTE*, which no one will hit in real life, nor do the vast majority of carriers have enough spectrum to achieve this, what the press isn't talking about, and what people actually care about is **battery life**. After the display, the two biggest consumers of battery are the SoC and the radios (modem, transceiver, power amplifiers). So what will the difference be between the two models?

iPhone X - A1865:

* Qualcomm X16
* 14nm Samsung FinFET 

iPhone X - A1901

* Intel XMM 7480
* 28nm (TSMC?)

As you can see, when it comes to the process, the Intel modem is 1.5 nodes behind the Qualcomm modem. A very conservative estimate would be just from the process itself, the Qualcomm modem will be at least 30% more power efficient. There's very little public information available on the transceivers, but given that the Intel PMB757 has the exact same dimensions and a mostly identical die, to the previous generation transceiver used in the iPhone 7, I would once again expect Qualcomm's WTR5975 to have a large battery consumption advantage. 

A second, potential issue, that will affect battery life is cell edge performance. As [Cellular Insights] (http://cellularinsights.com/iphone7/) excellently reported, there was a relatively big performance delta between the Qualcomm and Intel iPhone 7 models at the cell edge. There were many anecdotal reports that the Intel iPhone 7 didn't maintain a connection where the Qualcomm model did as well. Skeptics dismissed the report and complaints saying that in the real world, a 10-30Mbps difference isn't noticeable. Before we go into that, once again, some background:

Phone radios use drastically different amounts of energy depending on what they're doing. For the vast majority of the time, your phone is in standby, sitting in your pocket, or on your desk, with the screen off. During this time, your phone's radio is in an idle state, camping on a nearby cell. When someone calls, a message is pushed to your phone, or you turn it on and start checking your email, your phone's radio is suddenly pushed into an activated state, and is using up to 100x the power compared to when it was idle. As a result of this difference, the phone's radio resource management software is always trying to idle as long as possible, and when active, transmit data as quickly as possible so it can complete it's task and go back to idling, just like a CPU. Now let's take the following scenario:

You're somewhere with weak signal, and you pull out your phone to check the score of the game and watch some highlights: 

* With a good RF stack, despite the weak signal, you connect, download the data somewhat quickly, view the score, watch the highlights, press the power button, and the screen turns off and your phone goes back to idle. 
* With a weak RF stack, you connect, but the data takes a much longer time to download. Not only is your radio in a high power state for longer to download the same amount of data, you're also sitting around waiting, staring at your screen which has to be on longer as well (which is the biggest power suck of all). In an extreme case, your phone may not be able to maintain its connection with its current cell, which triggers a search for other cells to connect to, which one of the most power intensive things your radio can do

Since Intel essentially has no other design wins other than the iPhone, we won't know how much of an issue this is until Cellular Insights or someone else does the same test with the 7480 vs the 7360. Hopefully there's been some improvement between generations but I'm personally not optimistic given the multi-generation lead Qualcomm has. 

**So what this does all mean?**

* It's extremely likely, the Qualcomm iPhone X will have better battery life than the Intel version
* What's the actual difference between the two?
* The above is the million dollar question. Due to the nature of the real world, and real networks, this is something almost impossible to independently test without tens of thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of dollars of equipment. With the demise of Anandtech, in general tech reporting as gone down hill, and I don't foresee anyone being able to do this type of rigorous, controlled testing. 
* To compound this, if I was a betting man, I would guess that Apple only sends out the Qualcomm version (ostensibly for network compatibility) to reviewers
* My personal guess is that in the real world, there might be a difference of at least a few percent of battery life, potentially more depending on your usage of LTE vs. Wifi, if you're indoor vs outdoor, etc.

**So why does Apple do this?**

* The Intel RF stack is likely $5-7 dollars cheaper per device than the Qualcomm equivalent which is huge when you look at the overall BOM
* Modems are critical, complex, and difficult to engineer. Even Intel with all of its expertise, and resources, is still licensing DSP IP from Ceva for their basebands. Just as Apple is supporting LG to prevent a Samsung monopoly in the OLED space, Apple is supporting Intel (until they do it themselves...) to prevent a Qualcomm monopoly. Unfortunately consumers suffer in the short term. 
* None of this stuff is sexy, marketable, or generally something consumers care about, so Apple can get away with it
* You've all seen the litigation between the two companies so I won't touch that

Note: I am not an expert and this info is all pulled from publicly available resources. If you have differing information/expertise/opinions I'm all ears!

*EDIT2*: A number of people have accused me of being a Qualcomm employee, or much worse. I suppose given the length of the piece and general psuedojournalistic standards, I should have included a disclosure, so let me do that now: I have not worked for, currently work for, or are in any way affiliated with the companies mentioned in this post, including Qualcomm, Intel, Apple, and Samsung. I have no active financial interest in the aforementioned companies and do not actively own their stock.

apple,iPhone X and 120 Hz,"I‚Äôve already noticed some people getting confused by the reviews that correctly mention 120 Hz when talking about iPhone X. 

They‚Äôre **not** saying iPhone X has a ProMotion display like the most recent generation of iPad Pros. What they‚Äôre trying to get across is that user input is sampled at 120 Hz, allowing taps, swipes, motions and gestures to be even smoother than on previous iPhones where input was sampled at the standard 60 Hz. 

TL;DR - 
Does this mean video and the display itself will look smoother? No. But it does allow for touching and interacting with the display to *feel* smoother.
