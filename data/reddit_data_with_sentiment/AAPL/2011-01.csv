iphone,Shit like this Apple..... sold me again. Thanks for great customer support.,"I got some new pants for Christmas that had a small cell phone pocket that fit the iPhone perfectly. The next night we went to eat some Mexican food and I wore those pants, phone in tow in its new home. Well, some grease dripped on the pants and as soon as I got home I took them off and sprayed the spot with some stuff and let it sit. My wife, seeing the dirty pants sitting on top of the washing machine decided to go ahead and throw them in.

The next morning I go to find my phone, and there it is, good and clean. I put it in rice, waited 3 days, and tried to plug it in. I got the apple logo for about 5 seconds, then blackness. 24 more hours and nothing. Yesterday morning I bit the bullet and took it into an AT&amp;T store. That was a bad decision.

The guy there tells me since the phone is new (about 3 months) they can sell me a new one for $699 OR, start a new line at $9.99 a month and sell me an iPhone for $299. When I pointed out a 2 year contract line was more than just paying the $699, he didn't seem too pleased at my multiplication skills and told me there was nothing else they could do. 

About an hour later I went to my appointment at the Genius Bar at the local Apple store. I told the guy my phone was broke, hadn't turned on in 3 days. He took it to the back, came back and said it looked like there was water damage. And by damage, it looked like a level under the screen with a little air bubble. I told him exactly what happened, knowing there was little they could do, but still hoping to just be able to buy one at $299. He returned from the back, said ""Today is your lucky day"" and handed me a brand new iPhone 4. 

I had the original and 3G iPhones, and this is the first time something so stupid has happened. But there is something about knowing that a company wants your continued business enough they are willing to help a customer fix a dumb mistake at no/little cost that makes me much more comfortable with giving them my business and investing in their products. I'm not a fan boy or an employee, only own an iPhone and a nano for running. But it was just a really great experience and wanted to share.

ipad,Using the Nook app gave me the single worst book-buying experience I've ever had.,"Actually, this might be an overall Barnes and Noble frustration.  Christmas brought me a gift card, and there were two books I wanted to buy -- both current new york times bestsellers -- but neither were in the store, because the store has been reduced to four sections: Nook, Kids, Self-Help, and Teen Vampire Lit.

I searched online and found that I could get both of the books the store didn't have for the nook.  The process went something like this:

1. download Nook app.

2. register account via nook app.

3. use safari app to register gift card.

4. use safari to search for books.

5. must purchase ebooks individually.

6. Each book comes with a confirmation number and a statement that reads that the books will be ""shipped within 60 minutes of order"".  Because, apparently, there's a dude who has to pull the digital copy off a digital shelf, wrap it, and send it through the tubes.

7. Wait three hours, during which time I can see the book covers on the app, but they won't open, because they will not download.  Attempt roughly 4000 times to open the books.

8. Shoot off nasty email to B&amp;N customer service about the futility of purchasing ebooks when you have to wait for them to be delivered.

9. Read through innumerable reviews about the worthlessness of the app before finding the fix: Turn off ipad and turn it back on.  


Boom.  Books are available.

24 hours after I ordered the ebooks, the app let me read them.

Curious if anyone else has run into the same glitch.

Barnes and Noble did send me three nifty emails in response to my complaint though -- two were about how I could use the FAQ to help answer any questions about their services, and one was to welcome me to the nook bookstore (and that one came well after everything else had been delivered).",14,17,2011-01-03,AAPL,0.035470470786094666,0.9343616366386414,0.030167875811457634

iphone,What does it take to make a successful iPhone game?,"I'll keep this short for you guys. I have an iPhone game I've been mulling around for months and in my opinion it's a great idea if executed correctly. I can't program for crap (nor do I have the time to learn) but wouldn't mind offering a developer to work on the project.

**Few Questions:**

What is the price range for a 2D iPhone game that is somewhat detailed? ($5,000 - $20,000?)

What's the chances of actually making a return? Has anyone spent a decent amount of time or money into an iPhone game and had it not work out?

I'm thinking of charging $1.99 for it and let's estimate the development cost at $20,000. With Apple's cut I would have to pull in $26,000, about 13,000 in sales. Is that reasonable to pull off?

I ended up pitching it to the company I work for and we entered into a publishing agreement... fast-forward to now, we've successfully ported the game to iPhone/iPad!

My goal with Block Rogue was to offset the ""meaninglessness"" one often feels with procedurally-generated games by embedding a lot of deep lore into the story, some of it difficult to find. Mechanically, it's not as deep as a traditional roguelike. It's meant to be a fun, casual, but meaningful experience that can last forever. :)

iphone,Here is my late Christmas present for you: 100 promo codes for Printful,"Hi guys,

[Printful](http://itunes.apple.com/app/printful/id385487729?mt=8) is a reader app made entirely by me. You're probably thinking ""well, there's a lot of reader apps for iPhone and iPad out there"", so I'll let you know what makes this app so special:

- It doesn't use RSS feeds, but rather parses the articles themselves. This means that you can read the full articles even for pages that only publish an excerpt in their RSS feeds (like the NY Times and most newspapers). All the parsing is done server-side, in order to save bandwidth and battery on your devices.

- Since it doesn't need RSS feeds, it can also grab links from other sources, like your Facebook news feed or your Twitter home (you'll need to register for that).

- It also has support for news aggregators. If you subscribe to an aggregator like, for example a subreddit or Hacker News, you'll receive the links shared there, rather than links to the comment pages. This is how [I browse Reddit and HN using my iPad](http://imgur.com/a/cGBaM).

- The interface is really clean, and it lets you configure font sizes, font families and even color themes.

- All the contents are cached on the device, so you can read all your articles offline.

- If you have multiple devices and register for an account, all your news sources, marks and reading positions are automatically synchronized between your devices over the Internet (no need to connect your devices to your computer to sync).

- It has received positive reviews from a lot of popular review sites, like [148apps](http://www.148apps.com/reviews/printful-review/).

- Last but not least, you can also send articles from your computer web browser to your iPhone or iPad with a single click. Just go to http://printful.com/bookmarklets/ and install the ""Read Later"" bookmarklet.

I've posted promo codes for it here before, and they got all used pretty quickly. Version 1.2, with a lot of improvements, was released today and I guess you'll appreciate some promo codes. I'm not asking for anything in return, but if you like the app, it would be nice if you left a review. Leave a comment when you use a code, so other redittors won't need to try them all, and don't forget to upvote this story so everyone can see it. It would be a pity if some codes were left unused! I really hope you all enjoy this app.

[App Store Link](http://itunes.apple.com/app/printful/id385487729?mt=8) (more details, screenshots)

**UPDATE @ 2 PM GMT + 1**: Just got back home after a busy morning to find all promo codes have been used. Many thanks! For those not lucky enough to grab one, I have some good news: I've put Printful **on sale until Monday, it's now $0.99 / £0.59 / 0.79€ (regular price is $5)** http://itunes.apple.com/app/printful/id385487729?mt=8

iphone,How to have an AT&amp;T family plan with multiple area-codes and get grandfathered into unlimited data plan.,"The story goes that my fiance (LA Number) and I (New York Number) both consolidated our two individual AT&amp;T accounts onto a T-Mobile family plan that was month to month with unlimited data/text ($110 a month). We purchased two old iPhone 2G's and jailbroke them to run on T-Mobile. Forward to now and T-Mobile has no reception in our house so we switch back over to AT&amp;T under a family plan. 

AT&amp;T has an antiquate billing system that does not support multiple markets (area codes) on the same account unless you setup a business account (they may request an IRS tax number for the credit check, but they can do it with your SSN), sometimes called a National Biller or NBI in their system. [More info about this in a MacRumors Forum thread.](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=519330)

We did that and ported our numbers over and I discovered that for the original iPhone on AT&amp;T you must activate it via iTunes which only offers the Unlimited Data w/ 200 Text for $20 or 1500 Text for $30. Doing so now grandfathers you in for that plan when upgrading to a new iPhone. Our new bill is $120 = $60 for voice, 2x$30 for data/text.

tl;dr: Sign up a month-to-month account on AT&amp;T with an iPhone 2G, receive unlimited data plan, upgrade to a 3GS/iPhone 4 and you are grandfathered in.",24,39,2011-01-06,AAPL,0.030473986640572548,0.9415468573570251,0.027979226782917976

iphone,"International iPhone users, rejoice: Line2 is like Google Voice for the rest of us; I just started using the  app and its service, and here are my first impressions (so far, it rocks).","This is google voice for those of us not in the USofA!

If you don't want to read this whole spiel, then watch [David Pogue's great video summary of Line2](http://line2.com/fans_david_pogue.html). He's excited for a reason.

Here's the bullet-pointed skinny for most basic users:

- 1st month free (including free calls from what I can tell)
- **but $10/month subscription** (but keep reading...)
- **gives you a US phone number that ppl in US can call you on for free.**
- **lets you call US numbers for free!**
- **super cheap int'l calls (~$0.02/min to all the countries I call)**
- **free SMS to anywhere**


Now here's the real killer features for me:

- **smartly uses whatever connectivity is available: WiFi/3G/voice plan** (you can even pick which to use when making a call)

- **if kept in the background, it can receive calls anytime**

Extra features that are damned impressive too:

- includes a voicemail service that can email new msgs to you (haven't set it up yet)

- integrates perfectly with iphone's existing contact list (no need to import)

- great interface: copies (and beats) Apple's dialpad/sms/favorites -- actually, it automatically shows favorites to be the ppl you call the most.


Those are the pro points; I'll put up cons as I encounter them:

- it seems from the comments below that line2 is *only available through the US App Store** -- what a bummer.



Overall, If I knew of this service beforehand, I'd have gotten a cheaper voice plan.

Well, I'm still in my 1st month free trial and I think I'm keeping it.  Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything you'd like me to try out for you.

apple,Finally figured out why the Apple ipad is useful,"I love Apple products, but never knew why the Apple ipad was necessary. Yes, they are cool, but i never really thought it was something you needed (such as an ipod or laptop). Then, my dad bought my mom one for Christmas. My mom was paralyzed in a car accident 10 years ago from the neck down with very little shoulder and arm movement. She told me last night that it has been 10 years since she has been able to be excited about reading a new book because it was really difficult to turn the pages and things like that, but with her new ipad she has just enough function to slide her finger across the ipad screen, turning pages. This brought tears to my eyes, and i am so thankful my mom has found yet another way in which to obtain more independence. I was so happy and i thought this was something my fellow redditors would appreciate :) Thank you Apple!

edit: thank you for all the great comments :) i'm driving home from school tonight and can't wait to show her how great the community of reddit is!

edit 2: from the comments i guess you turn pages on the ipad by just tapping the screen, which is what she does i'm sure. Also she can't use a kindle, not enough arm/hand/finger movement

edit 3: she doesn't primarily use it for reading, that was just one of the main things she loves about it! she also uses it as basically her laptop because she can't use an actual laptop unless it's on a table so this way she can use it in bed and while watching tv!

Other considerations...
The iPod has both advantages and disadvantages including its cameras, Bluetooth, wifi, instant intuitive/dynamic ""finger"" input and improved voice recognition Some disadvantages are that it needs to be set up and maintained with a different computer, its screen is much smaller (although capable of video out), has minimal/proprietary port options and a real keyboard is a Bluetooth extra.

It's a simple reminder app, designed to let you get in and out with a minimum of fuss. Great for when the calendar app is a little too heavyweight—you can set a reminder in just a few taps, without having to deal with start/end times or manually adding the alert. A badge icon shows reminders you've dismissed while in another app (just like the badge icons in the SMS app). Finally, you can email reminders to other people right from the app. If the recipient has Nudge, they can open it up in their copy. If not, the iPhone mail client automatically generates a link so they can put the reminder in their calendar.

iphone,"I hate to say it, but Cydia is an absolute pain the ass...is there any alternative?","Is there another option that isn't super slow, doesn't reload every 5 minutes, doesn't crash repeatedly and doesn't take forever to switch between options? Every time I see an awesome feature or app and then read the words ""Available in Cydia"" or ""must have jailbroken iphone"" I immediately cringe and most of the time just don't even bother finding it and downloading it...especially if I have to add a repo. Right now I've been staring at my phone saying ""Reloading data"" and ""Loading Changes"" for awhile now...and I know when I switch sections and try to do something else it's going to do it again. What a pain in the ass.

There HAS to be a better alternative or some way to fix this so it's somewhat usable, right? I'm doubting that there even is, because if there was no one would use this crap.

If someone was planning to develop a better option, I would definitely donate to it.

apple,"Hey /r/apple, I've been having an issue with my Macbook, hopefully maybe you guys can help me out?","So I'd like to think I have everything in working order, as most of the time I don't have any issues. But for about the last 2 weeks I have been having an issue about 2-3 times a day where my computer will become completely unresponsive for about 20-30 seconds. The mouse works, but that is about it for this long worrying time period... As soon as the computer becomes responsive again, it's like someone hit a switch and everything works fine again. Obviously there is something wrong here, and I'd appreciate some help in diagnosing the issue.

Now for some info on the computer and what I've already done:

* Early '08 Macbook 4,1 with 2.4Ghz C2D, 4GB of RAM, 7200rpm 500gb HDD, Intel GMA X3100 144mb GFX, OS X 10.6.6
* I've run the Apple Hardware Test from the Applications disc that comes with the computer - found everything to be in working order
* I have run Tech Tool Pro 5 - found everything to be working order - [HDD](http://imgur.com/bRWA7.png) - [Memory](http://imgur.com/WbBSV.png) - [GFX](http://imgur.com/X59yM.png)
* I have repaired disc permissions multiple times - It doesn't seem to fail in repairing anything
* I have run the daily, weekly, monthly maintenance scripts manually
* I have checked the console for any rogue processes and errors - nothing appears to be causing problems there
* I have checked with activity monitor to make sure that nothing is going nuts with my cpu/memory - nothing appears to be
* I have iStat menus running and when the computer becomes unresponsive, iStat menus does not freeze, I can see the CPU/mem usage and it does not appear to spike
* I have run ClamXav to check for any viruses/malware - nothing comes up
* I have run iDefrag to see if my drive is heavily fragmented - it isn't
* My hard drive has 152gb free, so it isn't an issue there


I'm fully aware some of these things are unnecessary (anti-virus/defragging) with a mac... but I'm truly at a loss as to what the issue is here so I'm just trying everything. For reference, this will happen when all I've got running is Safari, Adium, Mail, Dropbox, Orangred, LogMeIn, iStat Menus...

I'd like to think I'm a more advanced user, so don't hold back with advanced things to try. Thanks guys!",56,13,2011-01-16,AAPL,0.10848287492990494,0.8633775115013123,0.02813960425555706

iphone,Sharing an iPhone tip that I found no help on.,"C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Apple Computer\iTunes

That is the directory where iTunes seems to extract IPSW files for restoring your phone.  As a jailbreaker after attempting a few failed restores I noticed my free disk space was disappearing by the hundreds of megabytes.  I knew what was going on-- iTunes wasn't cleaning it up, and CCleaner wasn't searching it as a temp working dir either.  I just didn't know where it was, and couldn't find anything through Google.

I just freed up almost 2 gigs.

*: Just to reiterate- this is not the directory of where iTunes saves packaged IPSW files, nor is it the directory where iTunes stores iDevice backups. Those are:

*  C:\Documents and Settings\[*Useraccount*]\Application Data\Apple Computer\iTunes

*  C:\Documents and Settings\[*Useraccount*]\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync

Cleaning up both of those can free up quite a bit of space as well, and the backups can be managed from within iTunes.  The one I am talking about is where you will find large, undeleted temp files that iTunes created when updating or restoring your iPhone/Pod/Device.

mac,Performance Tips,"Has your mac been running slowly lately? After nearly two years of daily use, mine was. I started with a basic Macbook, the first aluminum unibody model. 2.0GHz C2D, 2GB RAM, 160GB, nearly full HDD. I got the beachball all the time and I was considering a new mac. Thankfully, I upgraded instead. Here's what I did, maybe it can help someone else as much as it helped me.

Hardware:

I replaced the 160GB, 5400rpm HDD with a 60GB SSD (OCZ Vertex II, around $120 from Amazon)

I upgraded the 2GB of 1066MHz DDR3 to 8GB ($102, Newegg)

I swapped the optical drive for another HDD. I got the optical bay to SATA converter on eBay for $15 and a 500GB Western Digital HDD on Amazon for $53.

Software:

I ran a fresh install of Snow Leopard on the SSD using the DVD, before I put the optibay in.

I used the magic of Mac OS X's Symlink feature. A symlink is like a shortcut/alias except the system doesn't see it as a file; it treats a symlink as if it were the folder if was linking to. Creating a symlink for your documents, music, and movies folders allow you to store all of your data on the HDD while leaving the system and all apps on the SSD. This effectively gave me the performance of a 512GB SSD ($1400 on Amazon) for the price of $120 (SSD) + $53 (HDD).

Having 8GBs of RAM is overkill for most applications, at least in 10.6's stock configuration. The following tip essentially gave me an SSD-grade performance boost all over again. Essentially, you can use a RamDisk to turbocharge your system. A RamDisk makes your computer think a portion of your RAM is actually a logical drive such as an SSD or an HDD. Esperance DV is a software program that will create a RamDisk and restore data to it automatically upon startup.

The speed boost comes when you copy your computer's most-requested files to the RamDisk and fool it into thinking they are on the boot drive. Again, making a Symlink will do this for you. First, make a backup copy of your Macintosh HD/Users/yourname/Library/Caches folder. Then, copy that to your RamDisk, delete the original folder and create a symlink that points to the RamDisk. The result? Everything is much much faster. Simple, everyday tasks such as web browsing, managing folders, etc become instant. I have even noticed a difference in entering text.

I also moved Google Chrome, iTunes, and my iTunes library (not the songs, just the database) to the RamDisk. The result is around 600MB less of usable RAM, but extreme improvements in everyday computing tasks.

Then, I tweaked settings in Mac OS X to see if I could make it even faster. Two programs will help accomplish this: Onyx and Maintain1. In Onyx, I turned off all animations and useless Mac OS X services. This not only sped everything up a bit more, it killed off all those annoying transitions that are cool to watch the first time, but kill productivity.

Finally, in Maintain1, under the 'Net' tab, I checked the 'quick increase' box. This changes some settings and optimizes your internet connection for high-speed service (no, I'm not sure exactly what it does. Something to do with time-out values). It resulted in a very noticeable acceleration in page load time.

For $290, I made my Mac 'feel' faster than almost any Mac on the market today, that I know of. It proved to be a much better option than buying a new one outright.

Yes, the argument can be made that my computer isn't technically any faster at processor-intensive tasks. It still uses a 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo processor and NVidia 9400M integrated graphics. Rendering video is only slightly faster (due to disk improvements), and gaming is still terrible. However, for everyday tasks such as web browsing, it is many times faster.

Note: Some of the procedures I outlined here are probably risky, such as creating a symlink and moving your cache, not to mention installing an optibay. If you're not comfortable with technology, you should probably not attempt this. But if you are, have fun!

Symlink Instructions:
The best way (that I know of) to efficiently create a working symbolic link is by using the terminal.
Here is a list of what each of these four commands do:

1. Copy all files in your 'documents' folder into a new 'Documents' folder onto Macintosh Data HD (note, the * is used to indicate a space)
2. Modify the old Documents folder to allow it to be removed (usually Mac OS X prohibits this)
3. Remove the old Documents folder
4. Create a symbolic link where the old Documents folder used to be, that points to the newly copied Documents folder on Macintosh Data HD

cp -Rp ~/Documents /Volumes/Macintosh*Data*HD

chmod -R -N ~/Documents

rm -rf ~/Documents

ln -s /Volumes/Macintosh*Data*HD/Documents ~/Documents

The same procedure can be used to move the user cache to your ramdisk, although I highly recommend you make another backup of the folder as well (never have your only copy on the ramdisk, because Esperance DV isn't the best about saving).",26,57,2011-01-22,AAPL,0.05229254066944122,0.9177506268024445,0.029956845566630363

mac,Interface Tips,"Thanks to everyone who enjoyed my [Performance Tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/f6uv4/performance_tips/) guide! Inspired by its success, I decided to put together another guide. This time I will share a few interface tweaks that I have used to get the very most out of my Mac.

Hardware: These tips require any MacBook with a multi-touch trackpad (any Macbook from late 2008 or later) or any Mac with a Magic Trackpad.

Software: You will need to download BetterTouchTool and Alfred, and enable Spaces.

BetterTouchTool: This app allows you to customize your trackpad to get the most out of it. You can make any number of useful customizations, but I will include the ones that I have made (and that I consider to be the most useful).

It also enables a Windows 7-like feature of maximizing a window when it is dragged to the top of the screen, or resizing it to the left or right half of your display when it is dragged to a corresponding side.

First: Spaces. Virtual desktops are convenient, but using the keyboard to switch between them is not the best solution. I have configured BTT so that a three-finger swipe up, down, left, or right moves to the corresponding space. After a few minutes, once you get used to it, you will never go back. For example, I keep iTunes running in a space directly to the right of my browser, and switching songs is as easy as a swipe right, click, swipe left. No thought required.

Here is a link to the setup that I have in BTT:

http://min.us/mvb2tt

Also, a four finger swipe down closes the current tab / window, and a four finger swipe left closes your program (after asking about changes, of course).

Alfred is a great way to launch apps really fast, I recommend you disable the spotlight key combo (cmd+space) and use it for Alfred instead. It's really convenient.

These tips (especially in conjunction with the performance guide) really accelerate your Mac experience and reduce frustration.",10,19,2011-01-22,AAPL,0.02851923555135727,0.930084228515625,0.04139655455946922

Cogs HD - Very different puzzle game.


Labyrinth 2 HD - That classic game where you tilt the ball through the maze full of holes, but with a whole bunch of extra shit like pinball machine guts and whatnot. Great game.


Inotia 3 - Decent RPG, there's like four or five classes. It's okay, feels generic but it's somewhat fun.

First it showed me an error that the the sim card is not installed. I reinserted my sim card and it worked (happened twice). Yesterday the carriar name was gone and it was showing **No Service.** I activated and deactiveted Airplane mode and then an error poped up stating **""Restore Needed - Iphone cannot make or receive calls. Restore from Itunes.""**

I thoght I shoud try reinserting my sim card again. Did not help. Then I did a reboot. Did'nt work either. Showed the same error message.

So I thoght lets restore it. **Did it successfuly with iTunes (IOS 4.2)**. Now it only showes this:

http://imgur.com/a/lKkUb/iphone_problem

**I can make only emergancy calls.**

Restored then a couple times again. Always states the same. When I connect it to iTunes. **iTunes say the phone does not have a sim card inserted.** Even though the sim card is inserted.

I dont think its the sim card issue cause I tried the sim card on a friend's iPhone. It worked. Tried his sim card with my iPhone. Again Nothing!

The city I am living in does not have an Apple Store. I have contacted my carrier. They say I should bring my phone to any carrair's shop and then they will send it to Apple for service. Which I am intended to do.

My Questions:

1. DAE had this problem? Please share your experience.

2. Even though I have restored my iPhone three times using iTunes, can Apple deny any services  or refuse to replace it because it was Jailbroken?

My phone kept track of everything I up'd and down'd, but not once was it sent to my reddit account. Even when I visted the ""Liked"" section in Alien Blue - nothing.

iphone,"I made a fully functional radioreddit iphone app, check out the video","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQre-zd-EZ0

This is a preview of an iPhone app for radio reddit that I've been working on for some weeks now.
After many hours it's finally nearing version 1.0 and will soon be sent to Apple for approval. 
There are some minor things to fix before that, some testing to do, bugs to find and some paperwork.

In version 1.0 you can:

- listen to the different streams
- log in with your reddit account and upvote/downvote/submit songs
- bookmark songs (1)
- view the 20 latest songs you've heard on the radio (2)
- view the top 10 charts of all time/month/week and day (3)
- replay/play/vote on songs in 1, 2, 3 (in the bookmark list you can only play songs that have been enabled for downloading by the artist).
- use the remote on the headphones to play/pause/change stream
- on iOS4 there's multitasking and you can use the ""iPod controls"" in the multitask bar to play/pause/change stream.

The plan right now is to release two versions, one free and one paid - all depending on whether or not we get approval to license such a product.
The paid one is the one you saw in the video and the differences between that and the free version are the bookmarking/chart/recently played -features.
The paid version will also help support radio reddits costs for broadcasting.

I started programming this some weeks ago when I first discovered radio reddit. 
I wanted an iPhone app and it was only meant for my own pocket at first, but after talking to Octatone and Pextris, the radio admins, things happened and here we are. 
I'm quite thrilled and really, really, hope people will like and use it :)

What do you think?

Well, I don't know if this would work for every app, but consider Iconfactory's ""Astronut"" app: when you download it, the entire game gets downloaded. The first level is free (for trial) and then they ask you for an in-app upgrade.

I looked around for Astronut on different cracking sites. Couldn't find it!

And then, I read somewhere (can't, for the life of me, recall where *exactly* ) that there is currently no way to crack apps with in-app upgrades that unlock the rest of the app's functionality.

Thought I'd discuss this with the r/iPhone community; cause I believe mobile application developers deserve it. It hurts me to see a excellent $0.99 app downloaded for free... probably because I intend to become a software engineer myself. :)

**Snoo planned feature-list:**  


* Quartz-based image viewer with multi-touch gestures and basic editing as a bonus - almost done.  

* Fullscreen image browser for subreddits such as r/pics with smooth transitions and multi-touch gestures.

* Auto-refresh with user-definable intervals - done.

* Comment saver

* Speech support (maybe)

* Instapaper support (for syncing content to iOS)

* Growl notifications / dock badges for orangereds

* Token-field for quickly merging subreddit posts to single view - done.

* One-handed interface for browsing NSFW reddits - maybe ;)

* Sharing via Mail.app and others.

* More to come!

apple,Macbook pro was stolen and I think I found out who has it... Need some advice.,"I had my macbook pro stolen out of my car a couple of years ago back when I was in college. Fast forward, I went to sign into the new app store on OS X tonight and noticed someone else's email address and home address in the registry information. That home address is 120 miles from the town where I went to college. I googled his email and found him on facebook and noticed he has friends that go/went to the same college as me. Now it gets interesting here; I found a post from him on Yahoo answers dated about two years ago saying he needs some help transferring data onto a new macbook pro he has. He's also worried about this affecting ""his"" licensed programs such as Final Cut Pro. I had Final Cut Studio installed on that laptop, which is registered to me. Whenever Final Cut opens up it should say ""Licensed to feetus"" which would confirm that it belongs to me. It looks like he's moved further away since then according to his facebook page. I don't want to link to any of this evidence here because he may have purchased it not knowing it was stolen. Would this be enough evidence to go to the police and possibly get this computer back? Any advice would be appreciated.


**Update**-It looks like he has a family member that went to the same university as me according to facebook. They share the same last name which is pretty rare name. I also found a video that he posted online in October screencasting how to do various things in OS X. I can see in his dock that he has Final Cut Studio as well as two other Adobe programs that I had installed. Usually these programs come with the CS suite but I chose to just install those two(Photoshop and After Affects). I'm thinking about pretending to be a Final Cut noob and asking him to post a screencast about it and hopefully catch my name under the license when he opens a FC program.

**Update 2**- I left a voicemail for the officer that originally took the report. He works the night shift so I'll be waiting for a phone call later. This was probably one of a string of burglaries that took place that night in the same area so the cops would probably have an interest in catching the thief. I verified the date it was stolen and his Yahoo answers post would have been exactly one week later. I have the serial number on file with AppleCare. I just worry that he may have upgraded to a newer computer at this point since it was 2 years ago.

**Update 3**- I never got a call from the police officer last night. I might try to call him tonight but I don't think the guy has my laptop anymore. I was looking at one of his screencast videos that he posted online and noticed something. He went into his energy saver settings which had the option to automatically switch to the better graphics card. That option wasn't introduced until last year. I still think he's the one that had it but at this point it's probably not worth pursuing because he likely sold it. Just wanted to say thanks for all the help from you guys. I'll post another update if I hear any encouraging news from the officer. Thanks again.",93,96,2011-01-31,AAPL,0.06378739327192307,0.897152304649353,0.039060328155756
