apple,Apple now takes the majority of the profit from every single market it is competing in,"EVIDENCE:

Personal Computers - http://www.asymco.com/2014/07/23/is-the-pc-back/ - This includes prebuilt PCs, AIOs, and Laptops. Not including custom components, but that is a very different market.

 

iPad - http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/04/editorial-why-apple-inc-isnt-worried-about-ipads-idc-tablet-market-share- - No a majority share for the iPad there but it is am easy majority revenue and majority profit. iPad Pro will strengthen the position more.

Apple TV - http://blog.streamingmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-06-at-10.05.20-AM.png  - Apple TV and Roku are the only TV streaming services so far to post a profit, and Apple takes over 5x more profit and rising than Roku

Apple Music - https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_3899_paid_subscribers_of_music_streaming_services_n.jpg - not one music streaming service is yet profitable. I guess it remains to be seen whether Apple will be able to maintain this record.

apple,"Apple support makes things right, even more than I could have asked","Let me tell you about the best customer support experience I ever had.

I‚Äôve had to take my 2011 Macbook Pro in for service three times since October for the GPU issue that Apple admitted to early last year. First time to fix the issue (new logic board) which took five days, second time to realign the new logic board (couldn‚Äôt plug in headphones) which took less than 30 mins, and third to fix a problem with the display which took another 5 days.

Last night I started having the original issue again and booked an appointment at the genius bar. When I came in I talked to the rep about all the problems I had, how frustrated I was, and how it was affecting my work on some side projects. While running some tests, we chatted about New Years Eve shenanigans, how much I loved my aging laptop and had hoped it‚Äôd last a bit longer. After the tests came back with errors, he went to talk to his manager about possible solutions.

When he came back he told me that they were really sorry for all the problems I‚Äôve been having and that they wanted to make things right by giving me a brand new 2015 Macbook Pro Retina. **All**. **For**. **Free**.

I‚Äôm blown away by how well they would treat me for an issue on an almost five year old laptop. They even let me pay the difference to max out the specs (512TB-&gt;1TB, 2.8GHz CPU) which ended up being about $725 after the original $2,500 price. Many things to be thankful for this new year, including people going out of their way to make you a happy customer.",168,369,2016-01-02,AAPL,0.048058558255434036,0.9022771716117859,0.04966430366039276

*****
**Guidelines**  

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.  
* **One app per comment.**
* Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS, OS X, WatchOS and TV OS are all game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a few sentences, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc) because everyone knows about those.

*****
**Last month's top five suggestions:**  

1. [Nutritionize](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/nutritionize/id930333780?mt=8) (iOS, Free) - MyFitnessPal has been steadily getting worse and worse since they were bought out by Under Armour, so I went looking for an alternative. Nutritionize is a minimalist alternative, 100% free, and with no ads. Also the dev is a redditor and implemented a feature I requested in two weeks from the day I requested it. -/u/nosegrowssome

2. [Rhymer for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rhymer-hassle-free-rhymes/id1061553928?mt=8) (iOS, Free) - Rhymer helps you do one thing and one thing only, helps you find words that Rhyme without any hassle. Its my first app. Feedback welcome! -/u/M108

3. PDF Expert by Readdle for [OS X (currently $19)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-by-readdle/id1055273043?mt=12) and [iOS ($9/Free?)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-5-fill-forms-annotate/id743974925?mt=8) [(App website)](https://pdfexpert.com) - What an incredible app. On the Mac side, if you've ever need a bit more than Preview without all the baggage of Adobe, this is what you've been looking for. Powerful, smooth, beautiful. The tabbed browsing feature has been wonderful so far. And the app renders pages faster than any other PDF reader I've personally tested (I thought I should note that the OS X edition will gradually rise in price to **$59.99**). On the iOS side, I think it still might be free due to a promo. It's so nice being able to annotate documents on the go. I have my textbooks in PDF and it's great to take notes or highlight important passages on the go. -/u/aurora-_

4. [QuadStream](http://quadstream.tv) (tvOS, $0.99) - For all the live streaming fans out there: watch four streams with split screen on the new Apple TV. Found this one from /r/AppHookup a while ago. Has been my most used tvOS app since. Think it's still relatively unnoticed. Use it to stream Twitch, Mobcrush and VEVO streams simultaneously. Absolutely a killer. -/u/StarGW

5. [Zippity Swish: Two Thumb Tap &amp;amp; Swipe Keyboard](https://itunes.apple.com/app/zippity-swish-two-thumb-tap/id1054746852?mt=8) (iOS Universal, Free) - I hate looking at the keyboard when I type, and I hate having to tap every key or swipe a whole word at once. Instead with Zippity Swish you can type with a combination of taps and swipes, it's very forgiving with finger placement. I can happily touch type on it. It's like a no frills version of NINType if you're familiar with that. -/u/greendestiny

Thank you everyone for the awesome feedback! This is constructive criticism at its finest, and it resulted in some very nice action points for me and my team!

------

**INITIAL POST**



Long story short, we (a team of 3) spent about 6 months developing a physics puzzler for iPhone.

When we set the game to free as a launch promo, it got about 150 downloads a day, and average 4.5 out of 5 in reviews. When we set it to $0.99 in order to make a bit of profit, the average downloads are ZERO per day.

Trying not to feel like I wasted 6 months of my life, perhaps I can learn something from this failure. Looking at the game's App Store page, what is it that is so bad about our game's presentation that it gets ZILCH downloads at $0.99? Any opinions will be greatly appreciated.

Notes:

* Yes, we are aware that this is not the most unique game in the world - this was not the objective, but I would argue that it looks good and the gameplay is fun and also a bit challenging in a good way. We did pay a lot of attention to the details and to the implementation, and really poured some soul into this. I have seen far worse games do A LOT better.
* Reading around Reddit and other sources, we opted to not include micro-transactions of any kind and release the game for a one-off $0.99 fee.

apple,It's high time Apple lets us clear the 'Documents and Data' of each app,"I think this is an issue that fell on the developer's lap because Apple has been so negligent in regard to the issue of caching. Google Photos, for example, takes up around 1.3gigs of space on my iPhone. Google does not provide an option to remove the cache. Also, my Facebook app takes up 350 megs as cache. And the Facebook app is so complicated that I'm not sure if the option even exists. Right now the only solution is to uninstall the entire app and install it again from the App Store! 

http://imgur.com/4dPA0xb

The majority of people still buy the 16GB variant of Apple's iOS devices because it's a 100$+ cheaper. It sucks that a $650+ device only has 16 gigs of storage and not enough people are pissed off about it to vote with their wallets. I have come to accept that it's perfectly reasonable for a CEO who used to be CFO to squeeze as much money as possible. But I think Apple should really work on making the lives easier for people with lower storage devices. I love shooting with the iPhone but I literally have to backup all my files to the cloud every day because I'm left only with 200megs at the end of the day. A mature operating system must have an easy way to manage storage. Apple has done this to a certain extent but still has a long way to go compared to Android's implementation. 

I hope this issue is addressed in a minor update or at least in the next major release of iOS.

apple,Geek Squad using shady parts for replacement iPhones.,"I shattered my iPhone and as there is no Apple Store in my town I opted for best buys geek squad insurance. The annoying thing is that they replaced my authentic iPhone with one that has a thickets glass screen that doesn't feel flush at all and also has a yellow tint. The back of the phone also does not have IMEI number. 

Has anyone dealt with geek squad? They used to actually give you a brand new phone from the store but now they ship a shady one to you which is really annoying as I'm getting a subpar product when I originally paid for an actual iPhone.

apple,When Sony switched jacks 45 years ago...,"When I purchased my first Sony Walkman in the late 70s it came with 2 x 1/8"" stereo jacks and its own set of foam covered headphones. Amazing, heady days. But we also had a set of good headphones that we used with the component stereo system that sounded so much better than the Walkman ones. Only problem, they had a 1/4"" jack. So I did what anyone would do at the time and went down to the local Radio Shack and purchased a 1/4"" to 1/8"" adaptor. All was well with the world (apart from the batteries dying too soon and the wobble you could hear when the Walkman was shaken, or the hiss of the lower quality tape, or having to flip the cassette like some kind of Neanderthal because auto-reverse had not been invented/miniaturized yet).     
   
So this weeks frenzied Apple topic of discussion is the possibility that they will ditch the jack and just use lightning. Apple wants to move on from a technology that's over a hundred years old and refine their device by offering something superior to the current one. As usual many people are threatening to abandon Apple because of it (or the rumour of it). I agree, if you've invested in something and the carpet is pulled out from under, it feels like you've been cheated. But this is nothing new. It happened to me in the late 70s and will undoubtedly happen again and again until I'm dead and gone.

apple,"Apple is in a very weird situation with USB-C, Lightning, and the 3.5mm jack.","We all know that Apple likes to push the boundaries of what we ""really need"" in their computer line, such as removing Floppy drives and DVD Drives entirely and now even the new Retina Macbook only having a USB-C port and 3.5mm jack.

However, now there's been a lot of **UNCONFIRMED RUMORS** about how Apple is going to ditch the 3.5mm jack with the iPhone 7. 

Personally, I don't think the iPhone 7 will be the iPhone to remove the 3.5mm jack, but I do believe it will happen someday.

Here's why they're in a tough spot: 

 * Lightning is still pretty new. Apple has shown with their newest accessories the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2, and Magic Trackpad 2 that they want to use Lightning. 

 * None of the Macs (currently) have a Lightning port. 

 * Their Macbooks (speculation, but seems likely) will have USB-C, and perhaps so will the iMac and Mac Pro and Mac Mini.

 * Currently all devices have a 3.5mm jack, even their thinnest device the iPod Nano.

 * No other manufacturer uses Lightning (that I'm aware of) outside of Apple. (The female port on the iPhone, not the male side on like a cable.)

 * Strangest of all, lightning headphones already do exist.


I don't think the iPhone will be ditching the 3.5mm in favor if Lightning. Apple would have to either put USB-C on the iPhone or somehow convince users that Bluetooth is the way to go. There is no way for Apple to convince everyone that buying a Lightning headset is a good idea, especially since NONE of their Macs have lightning. 

However, this doesn't mean the iPhone won't ever ditch 3.5mm. Just not for Lightning as the standard.

Since Apple already has Lightning headphones, perhaps those headphones will be their targeting of the ""true audiophile"" or ""professional"". 

With the newest Retina Macbook, Apple has also shown that they're not afraid of stripping ports in favor of external port expansions for extra $$$. Is this the future of the iPhone as well?



Things that will happen in the future, even if nobody likes it: The 3.5mm port will either be upgraded, changed, or removed entirely. It may not happen this year. It may not happen in five years. But it will happen.


A personal preferred scenario that I see is Apple slowly shifts over to USB-C for all their devices. When that happens, then they would remove the 3.5mm port. I know for a lot of people a preferred future is the 3.5mm never goes away.That's fine, especially since a lot of VERY expensive equipment uses 3.5mm still. 


Another thing that's absolutely certain: Apple has been testing the waters on removing the 3.5mm port. They've probably also looked at models of the iPhone with USB-C. They've probably got a fully-wireless iPhone with Wireless charging and no ports on the phone at all! A lot of thought and testing is put into new devices and there's always more than one single version.


What Apple is going to do is sell the iPhone that will be cost effective and also make them the most money. Would a 3.5mm-less iPhone be that one?",782,1026,2016-01-08,AAPL,0.05487430468201637,0.9153556227684021,0.029770147055387497

apple,"Hey Apple/Safari users, a new RES is coming!","I don't generally post RES version announcements in /r/apple, and won't again in the foreseeable future, but I did want to share one thing with you all:

A while ago, there was a frustrating change in Apple's dev policy that meant [even people who develop free / open source Safari Extensions, and don't develop iOS or OSX apps, still have to pay $100/year to do so](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/397bn6/apple_wants_me_to_pay_100_to_continue_publishing/).   That hasn't changed, and I'm not happy about that.

However, a few people really wanted to see a new RES on Safari, and donations were sufficient to cover the $100 license from people who mentioned that's why they were donating, so I'd kind of be a big jerk if I didn't buy the license, right?  So I bought the license and we've released RES 4.6.0 for Safari along with the other browsers.

**Please note:** Apple is currently reviewing the extension so it's not yet approved for the store. When it is, I honestly have no idea if you'll be auto updated to it or if you'll need to manually upgrade/install.  I'll post in /r/Enhancement when I know more, but I won't nag /r/apple again unless the mods here request it specifically, as I don't want to bother the sub a second time on something that's not strictly ""apple"" content.",154,823,2016-01-11,AAPL,0.02445792406797409,0.926868736743927,0.04867332801222801

apple,"You can hide apps like Tips, Stocks, etc., in the 9.3 Beta using Apple Configurator","9.3 adds the ability to hide applications on the home screen based on the bundle ID. [Create a configuration profile in Apple Configurator 2.2 **Beta** with a restrictions payload set to ""Do not allow some apps"" under ""Restrict App Usage"" in the Apps section of the Restrictions.](http://imgur.com/1qyZWrs) Add the necessary bundle IDs like com.apple.tips, com.apple.stocks, then plug in your device and apply the profile. The icons will simply disappear from the home screen.

I'm still working on finding the bundle IDs for the rest of Apple's default apps. Post them here if you figure out more.

Edit: Just to note, you have to configure the General section in order to save the configuration profile. When you plug in your device, right click it, then Add &gt; Profiles... Then navigate to the profile you just saved. You might have to then accept the install on the iOS device itself.

**Just found out, this DOES require you to put your device in Supervised mode with Apple Configurator 2.2 Beta. That would require wiping the device.**

Here are the bundle IDs I do know. I'll keep adding more as I find them. These are case sensitive. Some could already be disabled in the Restrictions payload on Supervised devices.

I've been trying to simplify my life, as silly as that may sound, by cutting down on frivolous personal projects and using tech (hardware and software) that just *works*, mostly in terms of seamless integration across devices and online services. I used Android phones since 2010, but ditched it late last year due to lag, crashing, and other quirks, to try out Windows Phone since I enjoy Windows 10, my Surface 3, and my Band 2. Needless to say, Windows 10 Mobile just isn't there yet, Microsoft's launch of their Lumia 950 flagship was disastrous, I'm experiencing more lag and crashes than ever (even with basic tasks, like attaching a photo to a text message), and I'm back at the drawing board. I haven't used a Mac since 2011, so I'm totally out of the loop on what Apple has been doing recently, with the exception of me lurking on Apple subreddits. It seems at this point I just want things to *work* and don't care about customization as much as I used to.

Since the warranty was over and I had nothing to lose, I opened it up with a little help from an iFixit guide, and was greeted by atleast three hundred dead [Rasberry crazy ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasberry_crazy_ant#Attraction_to_electrical_equipment) carcasses, either attracted to the glue or the electronics/transformer in the AC-&gt;DC supply.

The ants died and formed short circuits. Luckily the power source was smart enough to switch off completely and not damage anything (neither the actual Apple TV electronics nor its own components) when it detected a short circuit or problem.

After some cleaning with a toothbrush, vacuuming and air-can blowing, the device works perfectly and powers up fine.

^([Warning: AC/DC transformers have capacitors that can shock you pretty badly. If you open your Apple TV up, makes sure to take precautions and not touch any capacitors that aren't drained. It goes without saying that you shouldn't do any of this with the device plugged in to the AC mains])",81,381,2016-01-15,AAPL,0.09476843476295471,0.8780738115310669,0.0271577350795269

2. The 2016 Macbook will likely attempt to be that thin again, which would mean an Intel Core M chip, right?

apple,Why doesn't Apple do a better job of removing fake reviews?,"I downloaded this Craigslist app called cPro and upgraded to the Pro version for $2.99 so I could set alerts. Then the developer changed the name of the app and now my in app purchase is no longer valid. I've tried contacting the developer and there's been no response at all. I've submitted a complaint to the appstore but who knows if they'll do anything at all. (I did get a refund after filing a report: http://reportaproblem.apple.com/)

Reading through the reviews I realize most of them are fake! And this is the #1 Craigslist app in the app store. They're extremely obvious fake reviews too, exact same text and title!

(Also how the hell are they getting so many reviews so quickly?)

apple,"Well, here's something bright about Macbook Air's future.","I work in an e-shop dedicated to small PC form factor (mostly industrial solutions, but consumer as well) and today I had the chance to test latest Intel NUC's performance. As you probably know, it is common for Intel to use the same CPU the base model Macbook Air uses. The D54250WYK model uses the same CPU the Mid 2013 Air has. The NUC5i5RYK(H) model uses the same CPU the Early 2015 Air has. If the trend continues and Apple go with the i5-6260U for their next Air it would be a beast of an ultrabook mainly because Intel put an Iris graphics in it. Yep, Intel¬Æ Iris‚Ñ¢ Graphics 540. According to my benchmarks, i5-6260U achieves *roughly* 15% better results in Geekbench, 200% better results in FurMark (1080p preset), 8% better results in Cinebench CPU, 100% better results in Cinebench OpenGL and 40% better results in Novabench. And what blew my mind the most: I was able to run CS:GO at Air's native 1440x900 resolution at a stable 55-60 fps (occasionally hiccups to low 40's) with **every single graphic option turned to max**. So, even if Apple doesn't do anything special about the next (if there's any) Air, it would still be a significantly improved machine due to the new Skylake chips.

I love getting notifications it was about to rain in the next 15-20 minutes (great when trying to time when to take the dog for a walk... he hates rain and snow).

For the past 3-4 months however (maybe longer, I can't quite pinpoint when I started noticing), it's fallen flat based on past performance.

I rarely ever receive a head's up when it's about to rain or snow. The most frequent alert is ""It will be overcast for the next hour."" Uh, ok, thanks Dark Sky. And plenty of times it's been raining or snowing and the app (both iPhone and Apple Watch) will say otherwise. All in all, it's been very unreliable and flat out wrong whereas in the past it was spectacular!

Locations services are always on. Next Hour Notifications are on and set to ""any rain."" I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling, restarting my phone (and watch) and nothing seems to work.

Anyone else notice this? If so, did you find a fix? Or is Dark Sky just dropping in quality?

apple,"Found a mint-condition, 25-year-old Apple Extended Keyboard II in a junk shop today!","I love the [Apple Extended Keyboard II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard) - my love falls somewhere between ""passionate"" and ""a little nutty."" I've got several AEKII's in various states of usability (including one that's been my main unit for massive amounts of typing at work), but they're all pretty worn with age as you'd expect for this sort of item after decades of either heavy use or neglect, depending on the circumstances they experienced before I acquired them. 

The AEKII uses ""ALPS"" mechanical key switches, and it just feels *wonderful* typing on these things, especially if you're accustomed to the much-mushier feeling of modern keyboards (which typically use a squishy rubber bulb under each key - modern ones are quieter, but just feel worse).
 
Anyway, my favorite local junk shop has been a good source of AEKII's lately - I've found two or three of them there, though all were in pretty rough shape (stains, yellowing, missing keys, rust, etc.) and will likely be merged into one mostly-good unit with some spare parts left over. However, today I spotted one in a large pile of keyboards, and when I pulled it out, I was shocked to see that it's damn-near new - other than some dust and a few smudges from the ratty / gross keyboards that were piled on top of it, it could have just come out of an Apple showroom from the early 1990's.
 
[Here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/upyAMr4.jpg) - note that I haven't even wiped it down or dusted it yet, so you're seeing it exactly as it was when I pulled it from the Giant Pile O' Keyboards today,

I also found another AEKII in the pile today, though the second is in rough-but-restorable condition (some stains, lots of yellowing, and a missing ESC key). Best part? I bought both for $1.09 each after tax. 

**EDIT**: For comparison, [here is an album of pics](http://imgur.com/a/n1x0V) showing the *last* AEKII I found at this same junk shop - maybe after seeing these, you'll better understand why I'm so excited to have found this new mint-condition one!",48,154,2016-01-24,AAPL,0.06516128778457642,0.90681391954422,0.028024781495332718

Temporary Fix: Turn off Safari Suggestions in your browser settings. Thanks to all that commented on the temp solution

Anyone else having this issue? Any time I try to use the address bar to type a search, Safari crashes. I cleared the history and website data with no change

iphone,"You are not alone: Safari is crashing for millions of users, even by simply touching the url bar. Solution: turn off ""Safari suggestions"" or use ""Private Browsing"" mode.","Edit: Even though it affected millions, I didn't mean that it affected 100% of iOS users. Non-crashees were fortunate, as it was frustrating as all hell since it closed immediately upon merely touching the url/search bar, and hard resets, resetting the app, deleting cookies and history, and updating the iOS didn't work. 

I just read an article published 34 minutes ago and all around the world Safari is crashing, even by simply touching the url tab. 

The solutions in the title will fix this, at least for now. I'm sure that Apple will fix the bug eventually. This way, you won't have to delete and reset and reload everything. 

Also, updating your iOS will NOT work. I was on 8-something and upgraded to the current iOS and it still didn't work. 

**TLDR-- Safari is crashing for nearly everyone, updating iOS won't work, and don't reset your phone and start from scratch -- just turn off ""Safari suggestions"" or use Private mode.**",68,173,2016-01-27,AAPL,0.06230849400162697,0.9100601077079773,0.027631452307105064

apple,Safari unusable - OS 10.11.3,"Powered up my Mac this afternoon, and fired up Safari. Started typing away and opening tabs and noticed it was acting very strangely. Tabs were not rendering properly, clicking the address bar did nothing on a new tab and I could not type, I couldn't go back to my previously working tab. 

Quit Safari and reopened it, same dilemma. I also can't use the address bar as a search anymore - I need to type the full URL in.

There's also some strange UI issues, like in the address bar the text is displayed twice (see pictures):
http://i.imgur.com/Bo91xf5.png
http://i.imgur.com/mu92BBg.png

What I have tried:

* Reboot (duh)
* Reset PRAM
* Reset SMC
* Completely trashed every Safari preference file and cache (effectively returning it to stock)
* Removed all Internet Plugins and Extensions (I only had RES and Adblock, both gone now)
* Ran First Aid on disk (permissions repair)

Currently I'm using Firefox with no issues. This is the first time I've *ever* experienced something like this in my 10+ years of Mac use and it's truly bizarre. 

* Safari 9.0.3 (11601.4.4)
* El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21)

My other Macs are running Safari fine. I consider myself to be pretty competent with Macs (my entire job revolves around Apple) and this has me stumped. Googling returns the usual results of people having issues with Safari plugins etc.

The only thing I have done prior to today is update Windows on my Bootcamp partition (queue Windows jokes). No other software updates have been ran or any major changes made to OS X.

Any ideas, I don't like Firefox!

EDIT: Thanks to u/Sobox for the fix!
