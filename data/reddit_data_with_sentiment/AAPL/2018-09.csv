apple,Apple Watch Series 4 Morphing Comparison,"I had a hard time identifying the subtle changes to the Apple Watch S4's design, so I made a [morphing animation comparing it with an older model](https://streamable.com/u6ne4) in a similar color and angle.

The first image is a 38mm rose gold S0 Edition. The angle is not identical but close enough to notice a couple changes:

* Curve radiuses seem increased. Both the corners of the screen and the 3D curve of the glass. The entire case seems smoother and more rounded.
* The side button is now flush and has a hole (mic?) next to it.
* The digital crown seems flatter. The diameter of the crown itself seems similar, but the top part is larger, as the sides of the crown aren't as curved.
* It seems thinner. We suspected it was just a flattering angle, but pay attention to the bottom corner of the case, where there's the ""GEN"" in 9to5Mac's watermark. I'm pretty sure that part gets narrower with the S4. Also notice the S4 image is slightly more angled than the S0. If anything the extra tilt should make that part appear wider, not narrower.",136,1044,2018-09-01,AAPL,0.0229549128562212,0.9005894660949707,0.07645561546087265

A plastic tooth pick can easily pick out most of the dirt, then you clean the holes with qtips afterwards. 

Note that using a toothpick is essential. A qtip would not be able to clean out all the crap, but rather flatten some of it and further squeeze it in. I tried using only qtips at the beginning, only to find that a minuscule amount of wax came off. But when I dug in with a toothpick, all heck broke loose and it was like a diarrhea.

apple,Free iPhone X Replacement thanks to iOS 12,"**TLDR**

iPhone running iOS 12 was damaged. Apple couldnt repair it due to iOS 12. Instead gave me a new iPhone X. Thanks iOS 12.

Okay, first some context. My phone was an iPhone X 256GB running iOS 12 beta. I was in the airport security check, and I left my phone in my backpack. Once I reached my gate, I checked my phone and realized the display was damaged with white vertical lines covering half the screen. I assumed it was damaged by the security check. I could go back and complain, but I decided to get on my flight on time. I was ready to pay the $270 screen repair fee.

I set up an genius bar appointment for 3:30pm today for the screen repair. The Apple Center I chose was apparently very busy, the technician was 20 minutes late. No big deal.

The technician diagnosed my phone and casually asked what happened to it. Then he told me to come back 4:35pm, by then the phone would be fixed.

I came back to the Apple Store at that time and asked about my phone. A specialist informed me that while the iPhone screen was repaired, the calibration machine was having trouble running tests. He said that I'll have to wait another 30 minutes. I was a bit annoyed but said I'll wait.

Came back around 5:15pm and asked a specialist about my phone. She said they have the phone ready and asked to sit at the service table. I waited another 20 minutes at the table until a technician came.

He informed me that since my iPhone was running iOS 12, they couldn't calibrate it due to software incompatibility, thus, they couldn't repair my phone. The technician then handed me a new iPhone X. I was almost shocked thinking I would have to pay for another iPhone X. The technician said the replacement is free due to my inconvenience and not wanting to waste my time. He set up my SIM card and then I left with a brand new iPhone X.

Thanks god for iOS 12, basically got me a new phone.",305,2551,2018-09-03,AAPL,0.1268320381641388,0.8397102355957031,0.03345770016312599

apple,[Megathread] iPhone Upgrade Program - How does it work? + Tips to get ready for the big day,"[Good morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU8ziHVaPfw) /r/Apple!

We are a week and two days away from the official announcement of the new iPhone! As the date approaches, we've seen an influx of posts in regards to the iPhone Upgrade Program. Please use this mega-thread to ask any questions about the pre-order process, the iPhone Upgrade Program, and anything else you would like to know before the big day.

Any questions that could be asked here will be removed and users will be directed to this thread.

The iPhone Upgrade Program will be referred as ""iUP"" henceforth. 

Here are some FAQs that could be useful for new and existing iUP customers:

*Please note: I barely have information on China's version of the iUP and often omit mentioning it on this FAQ. If you know more about it, please let me know to edit the post*

**What is the iUP?**

The iUP is a program offered by Apple that allows you to finance (with 0% interest) your new toy. Think of it as financing through your carrier, but in this case, you are financing via a bank directly through Apple. The program allows you to upgrade your iPhone every 12 payments and it has [AppleCare+](https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone.html) (not to be confused with regular AppleCare) included in the monthly payments. 

**Where is the iUP available?**

The iUP is available in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and China. 

**When you said ""financing via a bank"", who am I dealing with here?""

The bank Apple uses for the IUP is Citizens One (US). Barclays in the UK. I'm not sure which bank Apple uses in China. 

**How much are the current iPhones on iUP?**

Here is a table for the prices of the current iPhones (US Price). If the new iPhones are priced similar to the 2017's models, then expect the monthly price to remain the same:

(USD Price)

iPhone X | iPhone 8 Plus | iPhone 8
---|---|----
$49.91/month (64GB)| $39.50/month (64GB) | $34.50/month (64GB)
$56.16/month (256GB) | $45.75/month (256GB) | $40.75/month (256GB)

(UK Price)

iPhone X | iPhone 8 Plus | iPhone 8
---|---|----
£56.45/month (64GB)| £43.95/month (64GB) | £37.95/month (64GB)
£63.95/month (256GB) | £51.45/month (256GB) | £44.45/month (256GB)


Here is also the full retail price of the iPhones for reference:

iPhone X | iPhone 8 Plus | iPhone 8
---|---|----
$999/£999 (64GB)| $799/£799(64GB) | $699/£699 (64GB)
$1,149/£1,149 (256GB) | $949/£949 (256GB) | $849/£849 (256GB)


**Do I need to be in a specific carrier to use the iUP?**

Yes. On the US, you will need to be on one of the big 4 carriers. There is no evidence of having a postpaid account as a requirement, but you need to be on AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon or Sprint to join the program. UK users don't need to specify their carriers. 

EDIT: You need to be on a postpaid plan to sign up for iUP. 

**How do I join the iUP?**

On the USA, you can join the iUP via Apple's Apple Store app, Apple's website and/or going to an Apple Store. UK users need to go to the Apple Store to sign up for the program. 

On the Apple Store app, the [process roughly looks like this](https://streamable.com/h2kbd)

On Apple's website, [the process roughly looks like this](https://streamable.com/on9eh) (and yes, that's ""Despacito"". It's a good song if you ask me). 

On the Apple Store, the process roughly looks like this:

&gt; You - ""Hey, I would like to sign up for the iUP""

&gt; Apple - ""Cool. Let me get your ID, a Credit Card/Debit Card (Credit if you are on the US, Debit and/or Credit on the UK), and you should know your phone account's information like the phone number and the PIN if applicable""

&gt; You - ""What if I don't know my phone number?""

&gt; Apple - ""You don't deserve our products""

**Does the iUP offer theft/loss protection?**

All jokes aside, no. You should plan this before hand. For example, T-Mobile offers a ~$12/month service that offers loss/theft protection (it also offers AppleCare+). Apple's iUP doesn't offer that. If you lose your device, you are still on the hook for the remaining payments. I have first-hand experience with this. 

Some carriers do offer protection for devices that aren't bought/financed from/through them. [T-Mobile](https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1250), [AT&amp;T](https://protectioncenter.att.com/attmdpp/en/faq.html), [Sprint](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/comments/700csx/total_equipment_protection_with_byod_question/), and [Verizon](https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/equipment-protection-faqs/) all offer ""Bring Your Own Device"" protection plans if you are interested. 

You might want to call Apple (1‑800‑MY‑APPLE / 1-800-692-7753) to make sure that if you are able to return the replacement device when upgrading if you end up losing your device. 


**Anything else I should know?**

Yes, couple of tips:

1. Once the new iPhones are announced and up in the Apple Store website/app, use the ""Favorite"" function so you don't have to rush to configure your wanted device when pre-orders open. [Here is how to do it](https://streamable.com/c0a23) (black bar is used to hide my name and email address/Apple ID)

2. Existing users: [Check your upgrade eligibility on this site](https://secure2.store.apple.com/shop/eligibility/upgradeEligibilitySignInOptions?_np=standard/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone_x)

3. When you sign up for the program, a credit inquiry is added to your credit report. When you upgrade through the program, another inquiry will be added to your account. 

4. On the iUP, you will get an unlocked iPhone. You are more than welcome to switch to any carrier if so you wish (the initial activation must be with the big 4 carriers on USA). AT&amp;T and T-Mobile customers may need to visit an Apple Store to switch carriers. 

5. You can get a head-start by getting pre-approved for the program before the new iPhones go up for pre-orders. This is only for existing customers. As far as I remember, the iPhone X's pre-approval was available on October 23rd (pre-orders started on the 28th) 

6. If your credit is frozen, you might want to unfreeze it a couple of days before to ensure that there is no problem. 

7. A new iOS update is now available. Please update from the iOS 12 beta.

apple,Speculation about this year's big iPhone feature,"The only thing we seem to know about the new iPhones is the usual annual improvements (faster, better camera, etc) but we still don't know about any big feature. 

Wouldn't it be great if something that the leaks haven't shown is that the new products coming out work with long-range wireless charging? What if AirPower is true to its name and actually is the base in which long-range charging is used with? Apple bought out Energous, the company that made this tech possible, and maybe this is the year in which Apple was able to make it ready for the mass markets. In December 2017, [Energous's WattUp got FCC Certification](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/energous-gets-fcc-certification-for-wattup-wire-free-charging-technology.2097585/.).

Also, I'd love ProMotion on the iPhone as well. 

Thoughts?

apple,The precision of handwriting on the iPad Pro is amazing. A quick comparison between the Apple Pencil and my Lamy 2000 EF Fountain Pen,"[Link to Imgur Gallery](https://imgur.com/gallery/Crbz9Pn)

So, this was done on a 12.9"" iPad pro. The app I used was Notability (what I take notes in). It came about when I was having a discussion on /r/penmanshipporn about how remarkably like a fountain pen the Apple Pencil feels, in the way it glides over glass. It was clearly designed by someone who loved and appreciated fountain pens, so out of curiosity I wrote the same things side by side. I have tiny handwriting, so it was interesting to see how closely they match. The only reason it does is because the feel of these two writing instruments is SO similar that muscle memory does it justice. 

The specs of the sticky note... yeah... it's a sticky note. \^_^ Stickiness coverage is 20% and color, yellow. 

The Lamy 2000 is a beautiful fountain pen. Mine has an extra fine Nib, and I'm using Kon Peki ink. 

So, yeah, there you go. Props to whomever designed the Apple Pencil over in Cupertino.... you did an amazing job. I love and use both of these writing instruments all the time.

apple,Just tried 120Hz display today on the iPad.,"Jesus Christ. The difference is immediately apparent, so much so that it screams in your face if you’re comparing it side by side with a regular display. Watching videos in general was way, way smoother on the iPad, the UI felt *alive* and my iPhone X felt choppy, like a lag filled mess after using the 120Hz display. 

Every single frame of every inch of an animation felt liquid smooth. It felt effortless in a way I cannot explain in a post.

As someone with an eye for detail, this 120Hz has spoiled me majorly. For others, it might not just be that much apparent but it’s there.

It’s just phenomenal, I hope Apple gets this on the iPhones asap.

apple,I'm an Emergency Physician and wanted to talk about Apple Watch's new ECG,"I'm an Emergency Physician and read/interpret ECGs on a daily basis. I wanted to talk about the Apple Watch's new ECG feature as there are a lot of misconceptions about this new function. Apple Watch's new ECG feature is pretty neat and a lot of people here are understandably excited about it, but it does have limitations. 

I also wanted to do a brief tutorial on the basics of ECGs. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Electrocardiography aka ECG or EKG**

At its basic core, ECGs measure voltage activity in the heart. As the heart beats, electrical activity moves along the heart and [shows up as the bumps and spikes in the ECG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/ECG_Principle_fast.gif).

Voltages are measured across gradients meaning you need at least two electrodes with vectors go across the heart. An ECG computer measures these voltages and calculates certain vectors or ""leads"" based on the orientation of the electrodes and displays them as a rhythm strip, that [looks something like this](https://lifeinthefastlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sinus-rhythm-strip.jpg).

Some of these vectors are direct measurements of certain electrodes, [while others are calculated by the computer across multiple electrodes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Limb_leads_of_EKG.png).

&amp;nbsp;

The most comprehensive ECG is known as a [12-lead ECG](https://lifeinthefastlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/normal-sinus-rhythm.jpg).

This ECG uses 10 electrodes, 4 on each limb, and 6 in a specific orientation around the heart in order to represent [12 separate vectors across the heart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/EKG_leads.png). In some ways you can think about this type of ECG as almost a 3D measurement of electrical activity in the heart.

&amp;nbsp;

The heart monitors typically used in the hospital settings usually use 3-5 electrodes, limiting the number of leads that are measured, but still useful for other diagnostic tests as they are typically continuous.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is Apple Watch's ECG?**

The Apple Watch ECG is a single lead ECG, measuring Lead I. This is great for measuring the rate and rhythm of the heart which can be very useful for the screening of atrial fibrillation. 

[Atrial Fibrillation Rhythm Strips](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Afib_ecg.jpg)

The normal bottom strip is nice and regular and also includes something called a P-wave that represents the beat of the atrium and is supposed to be before every big spike. The top strip represents afib, the spikes are disorderly and not regular, it is also notably missing that P-wave.

In its current state, the Apple Watch will continuously monitor your heart beat with it's optical sensor, and if it detects an arrhythmia, prompt you with a notification at which point you can conduct an ECG. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Atrial Fibrillation**

Atrial Fibrillation (aka a-fib) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and up to 25% of people above the age of 40 will experience at least one episode of afib. It occurs when the [normal path of electrical activity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Heart_conduct_sinus.gif) is [interrupted and disorganized](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Heart_conduct_atrialfib.gif).

Atrial fibrillation can occur in episodes that may only last a few minutes and go back to normal rhythm by itself. Some of these episodes can be precipitated by certain events like drinking alcohol, being sick, or other medical conditions. Some people will have recurrent episodes of self resolving afib, also known as paroxymal atrial fibrillation with no known cause. The extreme of this are people who have persistent afib and who's rhythm can be very difficult to flip back back to normal.

Having atrial fibrillation in it of itself is not necessarily an emergency. Many people with atrial fibrillation are completely asymptomatic and others may only have the feeling of palpitations or an irregular heart beat. 

Where atrial fibrillation can get dangerous is if it causes vital sign abnormalities, where your blood pressure can get so low you pass out, you feel short or breath, or your heart rate is dangerously fast. If your heart rate is greater than 100-110 or so, you are in a state called atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. At this point we would control your heart rate with IV medications in an emergent setting.

While brief periods of asymptomatic afib can be benign, sustained atrial fibrillation increases your risk for stroke, clots in the lung, and heart failure. Depending on the patient's risk factors, some people will require blood thinners to reduce these risks. The longer your heart is in uncontrolled afib, the more difficult it is to reverse as there can be an element of cardiac remodeling. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What the Apple Watch is not**

* At this point in time, the Apple Watch ECG feature is not indicated for the detection of any heart conditions except Atrial Fibrillation. 
* It is also not indicated for people who already have a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, who should be seeing a physician regularly. 
* It is NOT capable of ruling in or out a heart attack. Even a full 12-lead ECG can miss certain heart attacks. 
* It is also NOT considered an FDA approved medical device as some people have claimed it to be. The FDA simply released [clearance](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/DEN180044.pdf) [letters](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/DEN180042.pdf), also known as a 510k Pre Market notification clearance, that also explicitly state that it is not intended for people under the age of 22. It is considered as an over-the-counter (OTC) device and classified as Class II, which is the same class as things like condoms and home-pregnancy kits.
* It is also not a continuous monitor of your heart's electrical activity. It is only capable of measuring an ECG while your other hand is on the crown.
    * A single electrode ECG is also physically impossible. In order to measure electrical activity, there needs to be a complete circuit that passes through the heart. Not even a wireless device on the other hand can get around this as it wouldn't be part of the same electrical circuit. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR;**

In summary, the new Apple Watch looks like a great tool, but it is not meant to be a medical grade device and not a substitute for medical and professional evaluation in the case of symptoms. Even if your Apple Watch ECG appears totally normal that does not necessarily mean you do not have atrial fibrillation or other cardiac abnormalities.

apple,How Apple has silently raised the price of their smartphones,"So I watched today's keynote, when I came to a sudden realization

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, they introduced the iPhone X as a premium model, and the iPhone 8 as the ""next iteration"" and ""regular"" model. This was the first part of the plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, Apple announced iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR.  


The highlight of the keynote was the iPhone XS and XS Max, the two phones that hold all of the newest features. These phones were marketed as the newest and greatest, and as the ""next iteration"" of iPhone.

  
The XR, on the other hand, was marketed and described as a cheaper option. Apple is choosing to market the XR as the ""lower-cost"" option. It doesn't have 3D touch, a single camera, and also has a pretty low resolution screen compared to the XS series. The XR, as many people believed during the rumours, is the ""budget model"". (budget with extra air quotes)

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the thing. The iPhone XS and XS Max are being marketed as the ""regular"" models. To the regular person who reads about these new phones, they will see iPhone XS and XS Max as being replacements for iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. But that's NOT the case! The iPhone XS series is significantly pricier than the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. In terms of pure cost, the next iteration after iPhone 8 would be the iPhone XR.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words: If you expect to pay the same price for a base model iPhone every year, this is how your purchases over the past four years would look:  


\-iPhone 6s

\-iPhone 7

\-iPhone 8

\-iPhone XR

&amp;#x200B;

Every year before today, the respective iPhone from that year was considered the ""regular"" model.

But THIS year, that price category is being marketed as the ""lower end"" model.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, that price would have gotten you the newest model of iPhone. (iPhone 7)

A year ago, that price would have gotten you the newest phone, but not the premium model. (iPhone 8)

Today, that price gets you the ""lower end"", feature-absent model (iPhone XR)

&amp;#x200B;

Because of clever marketing, Apple has silently raised the prices of their flagship devices. Instead of just raising the prices suddenly one year, they released a premium model, set a precedent, then in the following year, released two models of their flagships, at the price of the premium. Then replaced what was previously known as the ""regular"" model with a cheaper, low end, feature-missing model. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, your average consumer will most guaranteed shell out more money for an iPhone XS, as they want the newest ""regular"" model. Not the ""lower cost"" option.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty fucking genius. Can't help but wonder if this is on purpose or not. It sounds almost like a conspiracy theory. Let me know what you guys think!

EDIT: People keep commenting as if I’m complaining about the prices. Apple can charge whatever they want. I’m simply stating the genius marketing psychology Apple has employed. It went right under my nose until I analyzed everything. Also, thank you stranger for the Reddit gold ❤️

EDIT EDIT: People keep asking how this is “silent”. Well, if Apple were to just raise the prices one year, the media would go abuzz and you wouldn’t hear the end of it. “Apple raised the price of their smartphone!”. By employing this strategy over the past two years, the eventual move to $1k+ flagships and ~$800 “lower end” models went under a lot of noses.",1420,5654,2018-09-13,AAPL,0.06249348074197769,0.9030025005340576,0.034504033625125885

apple,The most important point of yesterday's keynote was given by Lisa Jackson: Phones are going to last longer.,"While lots of us were expecting for hardware specs and iPhone model name confirmation, Lisa Jackson delivered a really important information during her presentation. It was this:

""*...we also make sure to design and build durable products, that last as long as possible. That means long lasting hardware, coupled with amazing software. All of these devices, including the iPhone 5S, run iOS 12, and iOS 12 is designed to make your iPhone and iPad experience even better, even more responsive, faster... just better! And because they last longer, you can keep using them. And keeping using them is the best thing for the planet.*""

So, what does that means for Apple, iPhones and iPhone users?

Apple is now expecting you to change your Apple model less often. It's really clear with this year's version of iOS: support for old iPhones from 5 years ago it's now the norm. Wasn't it a happy surprise for everybody?

So, instead of changing your phone model in a 2 year basis (when the new model is introduced), you are expected to change your phone 4 or 5 years down from your last purchase. The cycle is longer now, and Apple expect that from customers.

So, its natural that, if you change your habits, and start spending $1000 every 4 or 5 years instead of $600-700 every two years like in the past, you'll spend less in phones. That's why phones cost more now than in the past: you'll change models less often, spending less money a year in phones than in the past. And Apple is OK with that, and it's adjusting to it.

So, as a happy owner of an iPhone 6 plus, that's going to receive an update in a few days, I can only say that I'm happy with this new policy Apple is implementing, making phones last longer, and making us spend less in phones (even though prices are higher). And that Lisa Jackson is one of the best things that happened to Apple in a long time.",482,1494,2018-09-13,AAPL,0.027608191594481468,0.9062874913215637,0.06610424816608429

apple,[Discussion] The Apple Watch Series 4 is by far the most meaningful device that was announced yesterday IMO,"Before the event started I was excited to see if the rumoured ECG was really going to be included and they delivered on an approved ECG device, however last night I was only thinking about the fall detection which may be huge for so many people. 

When I was 17 years old I was diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures a month or so apart, I was lucky to not be alone for either of them but it pretty much stopped me doing things like walking home from college on my own, going running at night and really just being alone in general. Having a safety net like this is huge for me and for anyone else with this condition. If it works as advertised, Apple has done an amazing job with an actual innovative and meaningful feature. I'd pretty much take any excuse to upgrade to the newest Apple product but this really does mean a lot, I'm sure there are millions of people out there that this could benefit and I know I will definitely be buying one next month.",459,1065,2018-09-13,AAPL,0.0300810057669878,0.88804030418396,0.08187871426343918

#TIPS:

1. Favorite your phone right now on the Apple Store app for iOS. Specially if you are joining the iPhone Upgrade Program for the first time. Seriously. [Here is how you can favorite an iPhone](https://streamable.com/c0a23). When you favorite an item, the configuration you want will be available to add to the bag and purchase. Stop reading this post to the end and go do that now. 

2. Force close the website/app a few minutes before the store opens to avoid any potential issues. 

3. Tell your bank that you are making a big purchase tonight. You don't want to be one of the first people to pre-order and then have your bank declined the transaction, and then receive your phone on 2019.

Apple introduced some wonderful new functions and apps over the years, but a lot of them, and the list seems to grow with every new release of iOS and new hardware, doesn't function in the Netherlands (and lots of other countries). Some of them are by choice of Apple, some of them are due to local regulations, and some of them are... well, whatever. But they don't work, that's the essential thing. Let me give you some examples:

* Apple Pay
* QuickType keyboard with predictive suggestions
* Lane assist and speed limits in Maps
* News app
* TV app
* Homepod
* Apple Watch with 4G
* ECG on Apple Watch
* Dualsim (eSim to be specific)

Okay, I admit. It's not too hard to miss these functions. But it's kind of weird, that functions that were introduced a long time ago are still not working.

apple,How do you guys justify paying that much for an iPhone ?,"Full disclosure : I have an iPhone 7 since September 2016;

This will probably get down-voted but hey i'm still going to try.

I want us to have a genuine discussion. I really want to understand. Am I the only one who can't come up with a good reason to justify to pay that much for a phone ? 

I love my iPhone, and I love shiny new devices. I really do! But I just don't think the pleasure that it would bring me would be worth 1000$.

Because I think it has to be about that, right ? iPhones in the past 3 years (at least) have become so powerful and good enough that the new ones don't have anything that special. So it has to be about the pleasure and the fun of getting something brand new, the latest and greatest device, right ?


Edit1: Thank you guys for answering so nicely! I'm not judging anybody! I just want to see what goes through the minds  of people spending a lot of money for the iPhone Xs and Xs Max



Edit2: Wow! This blew out of proportions. I was expecting to downvoted to hell and get maybe 10 people commenting, all insulting me but I'm happy to see that it's possible to have a civil discussion around this topic.

But I feel like I need to explain what brought me to this. Like I said, like everybody I love buying something new and I enjoy the excitement. But personally, the excitement of buying a new phone fades away faster than before. I remember when I bought my iPhone 4 (first iPhone ever). OMG I was on cloud 9 for weeks and weeks, and would find any reason to use it. Same with the iPhone 5s and touchID. 

But things were a little bit different with the iPhone 7. Yes the excitement was there but it went away faster. 
And when I see the iPhone Xs, I want it!! I really do! I'm excited, but then I think that that excitement is going to leave me pretty fast again and then I would regret spending that much on a phone.

apple,[Discussion]A look at the new LTPO-TFT OLED Displays in the Apple Watch S4,"# A look at the new LTPO-TFT OLED Displays.

For those who might have the keen eye, you might have observed that the new Apple Watch Series 4 has something called the **LTPO-OLED**. For those who might have missed it, here's a screen-cap:

[Apple’s watch comparison](https://i.imgur.com/pgu9CS2.jpg)
[Source : 0]

## Section 1: What are backplanes
Before we can understand what the LTPO OLED really is, we need to understand the current state of OLED displays. 

When high resolution/large size OLED displays are involved, as in the case of high resolution Televisions and the increasingly common high resolution OLED displays on iPhones, there is a need to drive the large number of pixels correctly. 

This is accomplished by something called the **Backplane** which is a Thin Film Transistor(**TFT**) layer that activates the OLED pixels and control the current going to the OLED layer which then determines what they show and at what brightness. This is because unlike LCD's, OLED's produce their own light and so the Backplanes need to take on the dual role of LCD's Backplane and the Backlight by providing both the control voltage and the driving voltage to the OLED matrix. As a result OLED backplanes play a pivotal role in the OLED technology.

[Amoled vs Amlcd](https://i.imgur.com/d9993ro.jpg)
[Source : Google Images, might be subject to copyright]

On the other hand, LCD TFT backplanes let the light from the backlight go through and apply a controlling voltage to the Liquid Crystal Layer to determine what is shown on the screen. In essence, LCD's backplanes have a lesser responsibility than their OLED counterpart as the 'pixel-activation' aspect is absent. 

**TL;DR Section 1:**

It is important to note that Backplanes act as puppet masters for the displays that we see, silently synchronising millions of pixels a 60 or so times a second. On OLED they take on the additional responsibility of activating the OLED Pixels due to the absence of a backlight, whereas LCD screens, they only apply the controlling voltage to the Liquid Crystals. So any changes to this backplane technology plays a massive role in the overall performance and power utilisation of OLEDs.
___
## Section 2: Current Backplane technologies

The major three Backplane technologies used in both LCD and AMOLED include LTPS, IGZO and a-Si which are respectively **L**ow **T**emperature **P**olycrystalline **S**ilicon, **I**ndium **G**allium **Z**inc **O**xide, and **A**morphous-**Si**licon.

[IV Backplanes](https://i.imgur.com/JhxdM6x.jpg)
[Source : 1]

The graphs above show the IV curves of the three types of most commonly used backplanes. Backplanes include transistors and Capacitors to drive the OLED panels, but in the *simplest* terms,

The negative X-axis shows the current leakage when the transistor is off. **The lower the value here the better the power savings** as the standby drainage for switched off pixels is less. 

The positive X-Axis shows the current supply to the OLED layer above the Layer when the pixel is switched on. The higher the value the more the current is supplied to the OLED layer and the better looking/performing is the display. **LTPS backplanes are best in this regard** (owing to the inherently high electron mobility) but however drain some current even when the transistor is off. 

Apple currently uses LTPS Backplanes in its iPhones [Source : 3]
___
## Section 3: So, what is LTPO?

Put simply, LTPO, **L**ow **T**emperature **P**olycrystalline **O**xide is essentially a hybrid of LTPS and IGZO giving the high current when the transistor is on and the low power drain when the transistor is off.

[Slide from IHS](https://i.imgur.com/naawnTm.jpg)
[Source : 1]

Therefore, we can expect greater power savings when utilising LTPO backplanes. This is in the ballpark of **15-20%**. Thus, OLED's power consumption (already less than LCD's) can be further reduced, leading to larger screens at same battery life or longer battery life at same display sizes.

###The catch?

Remember the TFT transistors in the backplanes we talked about earlier? The new LTPO-TFT Transistors need to be slightly bigger to have these significant gains. As a result this cannot scale pretty well for high PPI displays. 

**This makes perfect sense in the Apple Watch.** Apple is applying this technology onto Apple Watch S4 which inherently has a lower pixel count and can benefit significantly from battery gains (owing to the relatively smaller battery size).

### What's next?

Apple has three patents related to LTPO (Source : IHS): 

1.	Methods of protecting semiconductor oxide channel in hybrid tft process flow [Source : 4]
2.	Organic light-emitting diode displays with semiconducting-oxide and silicon thin-film transistors [Source : 5]
3.	Displays With Silicon and Semiconducting Oxide Thin-Film Transistors [Source : 6]

It is pure speculation by me at this point, but we might see LTPO-TFT OLED screens soon on iPhones. Apple might be testing the waters with the Apple Watch Series 4.

apple,iPhone XS Sensor is 32% larger and Lens is 2mm (equivalent) wider,"[via Daring Fireball:](https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/the_iphones_xs)

&gt;*When I first started comparing side-by-side shots from the iPhone XS and iPhone X using the wide-angle lens, I noticed that the shots from the iPhone XS had a slightly larger field of view. They were a little bit wider. Look at the photos of the clown photo booth above and you can see it clearly. I didn’t move at all between those shots — both phones were roughly the same distance from the subjects, but the iPhone XS captured more of the scene. Apple confirmed to me that this is true — the iPhone XS wide-angle lens has an equivalent focal length of 26 mm. Not a lot wider, but enough to be noticeable. But when you look at the actual focal length of the lens in Photos (or any other app that can display the EXIF data of the image files), it is 4.25 mm.*  
*0.25 mm may sound tiny but consider that the “telephoto” lens is only 6 mm. The equivalent focal length is wider, but the actual focal length is longer. This made no sense to me at first. Then I realized it would make sense if the camera sensor were a lot larger. And lo, here’s what Apple’s iPhone XS camera page says:*  
*More low‑light detail. The camera sensor features deeper, larger pixels. Deeper to improve image fidelity. And larger to allow more light to hit the sensor. The result? Even better low‑light photos.*  
*“Larger” is all they say. Not how much larger. That left me with the assumption that it was only a little bit larger, because if it were a lot larger, they’d be touting it, right? There are “field of view” calculators you can use to compute the sensor size given the other variables, so I used one, and by my calculations, the sensor would be over 30 percent larger.*  
*I repeat: over 30 percent larger.*  
*That seemed too good to be true. But I checked, and Apple confirmed that the iPhone XS wide-angle sensor is in fact 32 percent larger. That the pixels on the sensor are deeper, too, is what allows this sensor to gather 50 percent more light. This exemplifies why more “megapixels” are not necessarily better. One way to make a sensor bigger is to add more pixels. But what Apple’s done here is use the same number — 12 megapixels — and make the pixels themselves bigger. 12 megapixels are plenty — what phone cameras need are bigger pixels.*  
*I think what makes this 32 percent increase in sensor size hard to believe, especially combined with a slightly longer lens, is that by necessity, this combination means the sensor must be further way from the lens. The basic necessity of moving the lens further from the sensor (or film) is why DSLRs are so big compared to a phone. But the iPhone XS is exactly the same thickness as the iPhone X, including the camera bump. (Apple doesn’t publish the bump thickness but I measured with precision calipers.) So somehow Apple managed not only to put a 32 percent larger sensor in the iPhone XS wide-angle camera, but also moved the sensor deeper into the body of the phone, further from the lens.*

This is a huge deal.",190,713,2018-09-18,AAPL,0.03249804675579071,0.8889822363853455,0.07851974666118622

apple,"A comment I saw on The Verge iPhone Xs &amp; Xs Max, and he is absolutely right","WHY APPLE WINS AND REVIEWERS LOSE:  i

Phone XS &amp; XS Max AREN'T for people who **already** use an 'iPhone X'. They are, as is the case with every new iPhone, aimed at people coming from OLDER iPhones (such as 7, 6s or even 5s/5).

The idea that Apple makes iPhones ONLY for those who bought **last year's** iPhone is INSANE. You don't buy an iPhone **every year** (!) unless you are a famous Youtuber or are filthy rich.

MOST people that buy one use their iPhone for AT LEAST 2-3 years (some for '5' years, even) before upgrading. Unlike Android flagships, iPhones are traditionally extremely future-proof: the '5S', which released all the way back in \*2013\*, is STILL getting software updates &amp; running smooth as butter in '2018'.

So.. The industry-first '7 nm processor', the '8-core ML neural engine', the crazy-powerful GPU &amp; ALL the other super hardware upgrades that might seem 'overkill' **today** are actually there, IRONICALLY enough, so 'people WON'T need to buy a new iPhone for the next few years'..

Reviewers always fail to take all that into account &amp; end up judging the latest iPhone **purely** in relation to how it stacks up against its immediate predecessor: So they simply quote the '15%' jump in this and '30%' boost in that. They don't see the '300%' jump that someone coming from a 5S or 6 would experience. Shallow A....F.

While long-time customers, aka the MAJORITY of iPhone buyers, understand Apple's long-term approach &amp; ignore these reviews.

Which is **precisely** why iPhone sales are NEVER affected by reviews, however negative or even positive they might be. Cuz for the most part, they're 'unrelatable'.﻿",1161,3403,2018-09-19,AAPL,0.058847684413194656,0.8915910124778748,0.04956130310893059

apple,When it just works intuitively. This is why I'm such an Apple fan.,"So, I'm in the gym this afternoon, and my Watch buzzes, alerting me of an incoming call from someone in my contacts list, and I definitely want to take the call.  Thing is that my phone is in the small bag that I drag around the gym with me, along with a hand towel, car keys, and recovery drink, and there's no way I'm going to be able to find the iPhone before the call goes over to VM.  It's noisy as fuck in the gym, but I answer the call on my Watch, whilst rummaging through my bag for my phone.

Now I have my phone in hand, and the call connected to my watch, and for a split second, my brain goes: how the fuck to I get the call transferred over to my phone so I can hear what the caller is saying?

My phone had been shipped to the wrong local sorting office for my courier. They were useless on the phone, the wrong sorting office was about 60 miles away but due to the way they work, they would have to send the package back to the other end of the country and sort it again. I offered to pop over to the sorting facility and pick it up, nothing wrong with a Friday afternoon road trip... can’t do that either, against policy.
I give Apple a call to see if there were any iPhones at my local store. They told me they have a ‘Plan B’ in place for this exact scenario. From what I gather Apple has booked out tons of same day courier resources to fix any of these issues. In 2 hours a same day courier was dispatched to grab my phone from the old couriers sorting facility and zipped over to me.
When talking on the phone with the Apple rep I said that it really wasn’t going to be a big deal if the phone showed up tomorrow, but they said ‘you obviously put in an effort to make sure you got one of our devices on launch day, the least we can do is do right by you and get your device  to you on time.’  Blown away.

apple,Lack of handoff between different devices for Apple Music is truly perplexing,"I'm talking about the ability to listen to a specific song (or podcast, audiobook, etc. for that matter) and immediately pick up from where I left off on another Apple device.

Spotify has offered this feature for years now. So why doesn't Apple?

Continuity between devices should be a *priority* for Apple. The way Apple devices work together is one of the main reasons I use their products in the first place.

Surely this feature has been requested by many people. It's just perplexing to me that Apple wouldn't realize what a big deal this is in 2018.

apple,Apple/Netflix need to fix crushed blacks on the X,"Would one of you XS owners check this out?
https://imgur.com/a/09qKNzz

Since day 1 all HDR content on iPhoneX/Netflix is crushed.  I’ve seen a few threads about it before, but finally decided to take a photo.   I work in TV post-production so this issue has really irked me.  It also makes Netflix unwatchable with any HDR content.  

Not pictured:  I have a LG OLED 8000 series TV at work. Streaming Netflix app in this same scene has great HDR contrast, deep darks, the light above the door is bright, but there still is detail in the shadows.  You can still see the graffiti.  Therefore the Netflix HDR encoding is correct, but somewhere between them and iPhone it’s breaking. 

I’ve reported it to Netflix more than once, but here we are a year later.   Where else can I get some engineer eyes on this?

EDIT: Temporary workaround.  It seems if you download your video Netflix gives your the SDR version. You get all your shadow details back.  It still looks beautiful because OLED, just not as thrilling as full HDR.
