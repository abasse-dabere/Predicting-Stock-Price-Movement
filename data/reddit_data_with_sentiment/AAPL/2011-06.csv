apple,"Apple's ""Retail Decade"" poster full text, with paragraphs","http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/03/apple-retail-10th-anniversary-poster-weve-learned-a-lot/

The poster itself looks good, but the transcript is nigh-unreadable. Here's a version with newlines

&gt; In the last 10 years, we've learned a lot.

&gt; We've learned to treat every day with the same enthusiasm we had on the first day.

&gt; We've learned the importance of giving our customers just as much attention as they give us.  
&gt; And we've learned the art of hiring the right people for the right positions.

&gt;  We've learned it's better to adapt to the neighborhood rather than expecting the neighborhood to adapt to us. Which is why we spend so much time and energy building stores the way we do. Our first store, in Tysons Corner, taught us our first lesson within the first 30 minutes. We had just opened the doors when we noticed the steel already needed polishing. With a special polishing solution. And a special polishing tool. That's when we learned that blasting steel with virgin sand makes it less prone to scuff marks.

&gt;  We've also learned that glass can be much more than glass.

&gt;  We've learned that a 32'6"" transparent glass box can stand tall even among the giants of the Manhattan skyline. That when glass becomes as iconic as the Fifth Avenue Cube, it can also become the fifth most photographed landmark in New York City.  
&gt; And we've learned that if you have to, you can close an entire street in Sydney to bring in three-story panes of glass. And when you create three-story glass, you also have to create a rig that can install three-story glass.

&gt; We've even figured out how to make the world's largest pieces of curved glass for one of our stores in Shanghai.

&gt; We've also learned more than a few things about stone. Like how to reveal granite's true color with a blowtorch. And that sometimes granite has veins of color that have to be matched.

&gt; We've also learned that getting these details perfect can feel like trying to move a mountain. Sometimes two. But in the end, the effort is worth it. Because steel, glass, and stone can combine to create truly unique and inspiring spaces. We also understand that finding the right design for our stores is critical. We even built a full-scale facade of the Regent Street store in a Cupertino parking lot to be sure the design was right. Which taught us the value of seeing things full size. We once had a notion that ministores would offer the ultimate in convenience. Then we built one. Which showed us that bigger can actually be better.
And we've learned that even when our stores are big, no detail is too small. This is something we learned all over again when we restored the Paris Opera store down to the last of its more than 500,000 tiles.

&gt; We've also learned that our customers like open spaces, glass staircases, and handcrafted oak tables. And that those spaces don't need to smell like pine trees or tomatoes to make them inviting. We're constantly working to make our stores more artful, more iconic, and more innovative. And we're awfully proud of every single one. We're proud of our stores not just because they're successful, but because of everything they've taught us. All the ways Apple Stores have made Apple stronger as a company.


&gt; Over the past 10 years, we've learned that our stores are the embodiment of the Apple brand for our customers. Now, our customers just happen to be the entire reason we're here, so let's dedicate a few words to them. Around the time we opened the store in Tysons Corner, in 2001, everyone else was trying to talk to their customers less. Which made us think that maybe we should talk to them more. Face-to-face if possible.

&gt; So we've found ways to strike up a conversation at every possible opportunity. We talk while they play with the products on the tables. And when they join us for a workshop. These conversations have taught us that customers love our products, but what they really want is to make a scrapbook out of family photos. They want to make a movie about their kid. Or a website about traveling across the country. Which has taught us that Apple Stores can and should be centers for creativity.  
&gt; And we've figured out through programs like Apple Camp and Youth Workshops that creativity doesn't care about age.


&gt; The movies and slideshows we've seen kids make are proof that all you need are the right tools and an idea. And we must be doing something right, because the kids' smiles are just as big as ours.

&gt; We've also learned that musicians can record an album in our stores that goes to the top of the charts. And that award-winning film directors are interested no just in our computers but in our workshops.

&gt; We've learned a lot about having fun.  
&gt; And we've learned our customers like to use our products for business too. Experience has taught us that having one Pro Day per week dedicated to business customers isn't enough. That we need to be open for business very day. And have space devoted to business training sessions, workshops, and events.

&gt; We've learned that every staff member should be just as fluent in the needs of a business customer as the needs of any other customer. Our millions of conversations with customers of every stripe have taught us it's not about making people feel like a computer or phone loves them. That's impossible. Instead, it's about giving people the tools to do what they love.  
&gt; And we've learned how to create amazing programs like One to One and Personal Setup to give people those tools. We created programs like these to replace fear with confidence. Because our customers have shown us that the ownership experience is even more important than the sale. We learned all this by asking questions. And genuinely listening to the answers.


&gt; And to be sure we're hearing everything, we've learned to converse in 36 languages, and a few of the local dialects as well.

&gt; We've even learned a few cultural things. The proper use of the word y'all, for example. And our Japanese customers one taught us that their superheroes don't wear capes. Which also taught us to see feedback as a gift.

&gt; We've learned that a visit to the Genius Bar can fix more than just computers. It can also restore a customer's relationship with Apple. And that we don't need a minifridge stocked with free water to get people to talk to a Genius. Knowing they can get exactly the right answer when something isn't working is enough. We even figured out how to shorten the time an in-store repair takes from seven days to one day. Our customers hold us to exceptionally high standards.

&gt; So we've learned how to raise ours even higher. 325 store openings have taught us that a grand opening creates blocks and blocks of excitement. That people will stand in line for hours, even days, just to be among the first to walk through the front door. And to get a free T-shirt.


&gt; Speaking of T-shirts, we've learned more than you can imagine about our own.

&gt; We've found that when we wear black T-shirts, we blend in. And when we wear too many colors it's confusing. But blue shirts are just right.

&gt; We've also learned that it takes precisely 4,253 stitches to embroider the Apple logo on those blue shirts. And we even figured out which direction the stitches should go in.


&gt; When it comes to product launches, we've learned we have to work hard to ensure supply meets demand. If not on the first day, then soon thereafter.  
&gt; And we've learned how to put our own products to use in innovative ways in our stores.

&gt; We've created entirely new systems like EasyPay to help our customers as efficiently as possible.

&gt; We've replaced the red phone behind the Genius Bar with more expertise right in our stores. All of these experiences have made us smarter.


&gt; And at the very center of all we've accomplished, all we've learned over the past 10 years, are our people. People who understand how important art is to technology. People who match, and often exceed, the excitement of our customers on days we release new products. The more than 30,000 smart, dedicated employees who work so hard to create lasting relationships with the millions who walk through our doors. Whether the task at hand is fixing computers, teaching workshops, organizing inventory, designing iconic structures, inventing proprietary technology, negotiating deals, sweating the details of signage, or doing countless other things, we've learned to hire the best in every discipline. We now see that it's our job to train our people and then learn from them. And we recruit employees with such different backgrounds--teachers, musicians, artists, engineers--that there's a lot they can teach us.

&gt; We've learned how to value a magnetic personality just as much as proficiency. How to look for intelligence but give just as much weight to kindness. How to find people who want a career, not a job.
And we've found that when we hire the right people, we can lead rather than manage. We can give each person their own piece of the garden to transform.",13,41,2011-06-03,AAPL,0.03350851498544216,0.9063166081905365,0.06017487123608589

mac,Battery Saving Techniques,"The two posts with users with great/terrible battery life got me thinking: can we have a quick talk about battery saving techniques?

My brother claims to have researched this, and says the following:

Modern battery technology (general and not specific to Macs) has a ""recharge count,"" which is finite. Example: battery has X number of charge cycles. Regardless of whether you have only used 50% of the current charge, plugging it in will kill one of your finite number of charges. So if you're the kind of user (I am) who uses your MacBook for 30 minutes on the couch, and then goes upstairs to plug it in, you're essentially wasting a charge. He has also said that there is a ""trickle charge"" feature, which does not use one of the finite charges -- but that is only used when you're already at, say, 95% (not sure of real number).

Can anyone confirm this? Am I blowing my limited number of charges by casually plugging/unplugging?

What about when I plug it in to charge, but the plug gets yanked -- and I plug it right back in? A whole new charge?

Any other tips for preserving your battery?",9,18,2011-06-03,AAPL,0.03170594200491905,0.9273419380187988,0.04095213860273361

apple,Dear /r/apple: I thought you might appreciate 100 promo codes for Printful for Mac ($9.99 app),"[Printful](http://itunes.apple.com/app/printful/id411590812?mt=12) is a iOS/Mac application which provides a unique reading experience by extracting the article contents and presenting only the text and the relevant images, cleaning all the clutter and the ads. It was featured by Apple in the Mac App Store front page a few week ago. I developed it entirely by myself, including the clients for Mac, iPhone and iPad, as well as the server side (for programmers out there, I basically use Tornado for the web app, Gearman gor the job queues  and a mix of Postgres, Mongo and Redis for both storage and caching).

Its main features are:

- It doesn't use RSS feeds, but rather parses the articles themselves. This means that you can read the full articles even for pages that only publish an excerpt in their RSS feeds (like the NY Times and most newspapers). All the parsing is done server-side, in order to save bandwidth and battery on your devices.

- Since it doesn't need RSS feeds, it can also grab links from other sources, like your Facebook news feed or your Twitter home (you'll need to register for that).

- Integrates seamlessly with Google Reader. Your subscriptions are imported and synchronized with your Google Reader account. Also, items are marked as read on GReader after in viewing them on Printful.

- Integrates seamlessly with Instapaper and Read It Later. All your articles for reading later as well as your folders are imported into Printful in real time.

- It also has support for news aggregators. If you subscribe to an aggregator like, for example a subreddit or Hacker News, you'll receive the links shared there, rather than links to the comment pages.

- The interface is really clean, and it lets you configure font sizes, font families and even color themes.

- All the contents are cached on your computer, so you can read all your articles offline.

- If you have multiple devices (e.g. Mac computer, iPhone and iPad), all your news sources, marks and reading positions are automatically synchronized between your devices over the Internet (no need to connect your devices to your computer to sync).

- Last but not least, you can also send articles from your computer web browser to your iPhone or iPad with a single click. Just go to http://printful.com/bookmarklets/ and install the ""Read Later"" bookmarklet.

I've posted promo codes for it here before, and they got all used pretty quickly. These codes are about to expire and I guess you'll appreciate them. I'm not asking for anything in return, but if you like the app, it would be nice if you left a review. Leave a comment when you use a code, so other redittors won't need to try them all, and don't forget to upvote this story so everyone can see it. It would be a pity if some codes were left unused! I really hope you all enjoy this app.

[App Store Link](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/printful/id411590812?mt=12) (more details, screenshots)
[iOS App](http://itunes.apple.com/app/printful/id385487729?mt=8), just in case you're also interested

ipad,Why to Devs get away with this...?,"What I'm talking about is taking a game that they've released for the iPhone, tweaking the graphics to fit etc and then releasing the same game for twice (or more than twice) the price of the iPhone version with no other differences?

A few examples:

Cut the Rope = £0.59 / Cut the Rope HD = £1.19
Fruit Ninja = £0.59 / Fruit Ninja HD = £1.79
Real Racing 2 = £3.99 / Real Racing 2 HD = £5.99

At least, if they are going to make the HD versions more expensive, make them universal so they run on all devices.

I realise theres more to it than just tweaking the graphics, but in many cases they are effectively taking the same concept and tweaking it to fit a different screen size.

If they do insist on gouging us for a second copy of the same product, at most they should charge the same as the original product.

* New betas are typically released every 2 - 4 weeks.  Sometimes newer betas aren't always more stable but you will have to update because:
* The betas **do expire** and Apple don't publish the date on which they will.  This means if you're going to run the betas you need to be pro-active in updating to the latest version as soon as it's available or your device may shutdown and refuse to turn on until updated.  There was one occasion during the iOS2 betas where a beta expired before a new one was released - this has only happened once and Apple seems to have extended the expiration periods since then, but it could still happen again.
* The betas will be buggy, apps will crash, devices will crash, things won't work how they're supposed to.  If you're not happy with that, DO NOT install a beta firmware - simple as that.  No one (including Apple) has any sympathy for people who moan about things not working in a developer beta intended only for testing new apps.
* For that reason, if your phone is vital for your work or something similar then I wouldn't put a beta firmware on it - sorry, you'll have to miss out on the fun.
* Apple can and have blocked developer accounts that have been used to give away UDID slots, so bare in mind that (while unlikely) that could happen.  [I think in the past this has only been for dev accounts solely used to sell beta access, so you're probably fine.]
* If you need to go back to iOS4 it is possible with DFU restores etc, but keep in mind any backups of your device made using iOS5 cannot be restored to iOS4.
* You may need to do things like kick your device out of restore mode - if you don't know how to do things like that and aren't certain you could find out then don't use the betas.

I'm not saying any of this to scare you away from the betas, if you have a fair amount of technical knowledge (and you're on Reddit so you probably do) you'll most likely be fine - but I thought I should make these things clear to anyone unsure.

It's around this time that Apple's developer forums are flooded with kids who torrented the beta, tried to restore to earlier versions, didn't know how and are cursing Apple for bricking their phones.  While I'm sure most of you are smarter than that it bares pointing out: don't be that guy.

Have fun with the betas!",43,115,2011-06-10,AAPL,0.08955759555101395,0.8830602765083313,0.027382200583815575

ipad,iOS 5 on an iPad 1 info for you,"I asked a couple days ago about installing iOS 5 on the iPad 1. I got some useful info, but no one seemed to just break down what works and what is broken, so here's a quick list of what you should expect and/or look out for based on a couple days of experience.

* Video streaming is largely broken. This effects HBO GO, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Air Video, and probably other stuff I don't have or don't use. YouTube works fine for me. **This is not Apple's fault, and it will not be ""fixed"" in the next beta.** I dunno why people don't understand that this is due to a change in the SDK, and will depend on Netflix, Hulu, et al, on releasing updated apps. Will they release updated versions live on the App Store that support iOS 5 beta? Don't know. I know some developers released updates for the 4.2 beta on the App Store. For right now if Netflix is important to you, do not install iOS 5 beta, there is no guarantee there will be a working Netflix any time before September.

* Some text fields in apps are completely broken. The recently released Wordi that was promoted on this subreddit, you can't even log in to get past the first screen. The OKCupid iPhone app is the same way, none of the text fields are selectable/work for the most part, couldn't log in or register. AlienBlue HD, when you go to submit a reply to someone by message, the text fields are automatically populated with some nonsense testing text, and parts of the AlienBlue UI are wonky, but otherwise work fine for browsing reddit. Any number of apps can be affected by this, which seems to stem from changes in the way the SDK handles UI, so your mileage may vary.

* ~~I personally cannot get the Mail app to display any sort of notifications, not on the lock screen or on the pull-down, though every other app seems to play nicely with the new pull-down system.~~ **UPDATE**: Thanks to *erillanos*: if you turn your iPad off and back on again after turning Mail notifications on, rebooting your iPad turns them on properly.

* Since I'm in the Twitter Pics beta or whatever, the Twitter integration and photo posting works great for me. Don't know if it'll work great for you. Non-pics beta people on Twitter just see absolutely nothing when trying to view pictures you upload using it, so don't bother using it regularly.

* Speed wise my iPad 1 performs on iOS 5 similarly to the way it did on 4.3, which is to say that it is kind of laggy sometimes. I would not say that it's decreased my speed any in normal app usage. New Safari and the new Music app lag worse than anything else. My buddy who still has his iPad on 4.2 has better performance than me still. He can play Infinity Blade, which I'm willing to bet still crashes on my iPad under iOS 5.

* No, you can't hide that Newsstand app anywhere.

* Swiping on the lockscreen to go to apps that have sent you notifications doesn't seem to work on the iPad.

* Dropbox integration is broken in iA Writer. This makes me think it's safe to assume Dropbox integration is broken in most apps.

* iPad 1 set up in developer mode does not seem to have access to ""multitasking gestures"" even though it used to in the 4.3 beta. iPad 2 does however. My searching and attempts haven't discovered any way to change this sad fact. Might be the one instance of feature-deprivation for an 'old' iPad.

apple,New policy:  Please submit tech support questions to /r/AppleHelp,"There was a bit of discussion in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/hvqbj/another_gentle_reminder_of_rapplehelp_please_try/) yesterday and today.   

The conclusion that we have come to at this time is to direct all future tech support questions to [r/AppleHelp](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/).  

This will then allow those who are most interested in these kinds of issues to discuss them with help seekers in a forum designed specifically for that purpose.   It will also eliminate the problem of downvoting by those who don't want to see the questions here in the flagship subreddit. 

In short, this subreddit is now pretty big.  It's no longer a small Apple news and support forum.  We are going to pass 50,000 subscribers in the next few weeks here.   And not everyone wants to see the basic questions.  So, we need to redirect them to a place where they can be addressed most effectively, for both the questioner and the community.  

We have highlighted this new policy in the r/Apple sidebar over there -------&gt;  

If you have a question about this policy, please ask here.   If you have a tech support question, please visit [r/Applehelp](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp) and ask there.

apple,Odd things you've heard people say about Macs.,"Just curious about what strange things people have overheard about Macs. I'll start with two that come to memory:
1. A couple years ago I answered a phone call at work. It was an IT support company making a cold sales call. When I told the person on the phone that our office was all  Macs he replied ""oh you're one of THOSE people"". 
2. While showing someone my old iBook G4 I was told ""My friend has a computer exactly like that, except it's a Toshiba"".",613,169,2011-06-18,AAPL,0.05071764066815376,0.90973961353302,0.03954271227121353
iphone,"3 year old iPhone 3G, now nearly unusable.  Is the phones hardware to blame or is Apple phasing out later phones with their iOS?","The phone is ridiculously slow.  I mean it takes sometimes 3 minutes to open the messaging app.  Texting is a nightmare because it lags constantly while entering text.  Maps app is nearly unusable because it freezes for minutes at a time.  Resetting/restarting phone only helps marginally.  Another problem is the battery, which seems to hold only a 1hour charge these days (1 hour of use).  I have to charge it eve night and sometimes during the day.  The last problem is the wifi and cell connections.  I cannot connect to my house's wifi in places I used to be able to, where currently my iPad and laptop have no issues.  

The phone has been dropped more than a few times.  Could this be the cause?  I know some electronics depend on magnetics which can be damaged by collisions.

What is the cause of all this?  Is it that the hardware just cant handle the current demand from the applications? Is Apple purposefully trying to get me to buy a new device?  Has anyone else noticed any of these problems?

Tl;dr - iPhone 3G is ridiculously slow. Why?

Zombie Turtle Defense is my latest and greatest iPhone game. I'm putting a lot of work into adding to the game after release and I have temporarily made the game free to celebrate the upcoming release of the first major update!! 

The 2.0 update will include 5 more levels, tighter controls, more zombie turtles, and more fun! The game will return to $0.99 upon release of the update.

ZTD is being received pretty well so far...

""Zombie Turtle Defense is a fun little action jaunt, which -- rather pleasingly -- requires more skill than you than you'd initially expect. This challenging level of difficulty and engaging style of play complement the simple yet pretty graphics perfectly, making ZTD just as good for longer stints as it is short sharp burst of play."" - Simon Potticary, TouchArcade

Game Description:

The zombie turtle apocalypse has begun and the fate of all turtle-kind rests in your green, leathery claws!

Zombie Turtle Defense is a fast and fun dual-stick survival/shooter game with three unique game modes: Kill the Zombie Turtles, Collect the Turtle Food, and Survival.

Gameplay Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtV8N_8o1ag

iTunes Link: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zombie-turtle-defense/id441444848?mt=8

iphone,"/r/apple moderator changes CSS, bans all criticism","[Sorry to hijack this subreddit, but I obviously can't post this in /r/apple and the rest of Reddit has many Apple-haters]

So over at /r/apple, [Positronic_Matrix](http://www.reddit.com/user/Positronic_Matrix) recently revamped the CSS for the subreddit.

One of the modifications was an ever-present image of Steve Jobs (it's changed many times since then; the first one was quite obnoxious) in the right sidebar. I and many other readers thought this was excessive, so another reader (not me), posted [Can we get rid of that picture of Steve from the sidebar? It's creepy. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/i31sv/can_we_get_rid_of_that_picture_of_steve_from_the/). It received an overwhelmingly positive response, with over 800 upvotes and an 81% liked ratio. The top comment, at 316 points, was to remove the picture entirely.

I decided to take matters into my own hands and write a GreaseMonkey script to remove the picture. I posted [Greasemonkey script to remove image on the right](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/i3na6/greasemonkey_script_to_remove_image_on_the_right/). Upon reading it, Positronic_Matrix left a sarcastic comment and immediately banned the link. When I inquired as to what had happened, he sent me an unapologetic response and banned the earlier 800-upvote submission.

Some excerpts from his messages:

&gt;I did ban it. The r/apple subreddit is for news and stories, not for endless complaints about photographs. I've decided to draw the line right now and here starting with your post.

&gt; To be fair, I also removed the other post complaining about the right picture that is out of date. I should have redirected from the beginning, however I was having fun. It set a bad precedent and opened the door for using the main page as a forum for complaints. That's definitely something I don't want to encourage. I apologize for my lack of discipline. :(

&gt;At this moment, I have made the decision to remove complaining from the front page regarding the layout and to be fair to you, I removed any other comment with similar content. No more trolling pictures (intentional or unintentional).

He is attempting to shunt all criticism to a [tiny thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/hxp2n/feedback_on_the_new_rapplehelp_layout_requested/) in a *different subreddit*, against the obvious wishes of the community who upvoted the original post 800 times. And of course, all *positive* feedback, which is also in violation of his ""all CSS stuff goes here"" policy, is left unbanned.

So yeah, am I the only one who thinks this is unacceptable for a moderator?

EDIT: To help, please [message the /r/apple moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23apple) asking them to unban the posts and tell Positronic_Matrix to apologize; there's 3 above him ([qgyh](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=qgyh2), [kn0thing](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kn0thing), and [davidreiss666](http://www.reddit.com/user/davidreiss666])) that are capable of removing him if absolutely necessary.",112,305,2011-06-20,AAPL,0.16850869357585907,0.8049021363258362,0.026589123532176018

iphone,"So, what are the iPhone's ""killer apps""? (In particular vs droid apps)","I ask this because I was a droid user but I am trying out an iphone (I have 14 days to return).  I've just apparently confirmed, from another of my posts to this subreddit, that there's nothing on the iPhone comparable to the free google maps, as it functions on android but not on the iphone, to do navigation to a biz found by speech (input); no typing necessary.  Mapquest will do the navigation but not the speech.  I have to say I've really gotten used to google maps.  It works well and it's free.

However, I can't help that I'm forcing the iPhone to play on droid's turf when I ask, how does it compare to what the droid does best (because if the droid had a horrible app I wouldn't have used it and asked for an apple equivalent). 

So, what do iPhone users think are the killer apps; apps they could not live without.

apple,A list of nice open source Mac OS X software.,"It seems like it is sometimes hard to find good open source software for Mac OS X. To try and help people, and out of sheer boredom, I made this list:

*Edit: I decided that I want to keep this list to simpler things about on par with what is here now. I say this because if you use the higher level types of software, you likely don't have much trouble finding open source options. I will still update it for a while, I will just not include programming-level things anymore.*

I downloaded a package a few months back onto my laptop, but then it was stolen, and then I bricked my iPhone and had to restore to factory settings, so I've lost my ringtones, including the one's I painstakingly crafted in Goldwave. I used to have the NES Mario Bros 2 overworld and character select music, but I also had some others. Most of the sites I've found so far come up with 404 errors when I try to download the ringtone pack zip files.

Pick the categories you want to surf and then keep hitting the 'Discover' button as the site will bring up random apps satisfying the criteria from the AppStore.

I spent the last few months teaching myself objective-c as a hobby because I couldn't get enrolled into the classes for it at my university. After a bit of learning the basics I decided I didn't really like any of the to do lists I had been using on my iPhone (this was all before iOS 5 was announced) so I may as well make my own.

It's pretty simple, because it does all I want but nothing more. It's called [No Surprises](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/no-surprises/id444083764?mt=8), it's free, and any and all feedback is welcome :)",33,61,2011-06-29,AAPL,0.027042055502533913,0.9295202493667603,0.04343770816922188

apple,To those looking at upgrading your hard drives to SSD's... My experience.,"First off, there's a lot of misinformation out there. Should you go with SATA II OR SATA III? Which brand should you get? Here's what I went with: I have a 2011 MBP 13. I went with the Intel 320 Series 120 GB. Reviews say uses less power than most SSD's, especially sandforce based drives. But SATA III is faster, you say. Not so. I previously owned a MBA and there is no noticeable speed difference between the two SSD's. The MBA SSD benches much lower than the Intel, but boot time was identical. The spinning gear under the Apple logo never has the chance to appear before the desktop shows up. Application launch times are the same. Many people have reported issues with SATA III drives. Don't risk it. Here are some other helpful tips: I installed trim enabler. I also changed the sleep mode from 3 to 0. This prevents the SSD from writing--in my case--8 GB everytime I put my Mac to sleep. To do this open up terminal and type: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0.  
Next is to remove the sleep image to free up space. In my case it's 8 GB. In terminal type cd /var/vm
Then type sudo rm sleepimage
Also I changed the time for the drive to enter it's lower power state from the default 10 minutes to 3 minutes. To do this, in terminal type: sudo pmset -b disksleep 3 
You can set the number to a higher or lower value, however a value between 3 and 5 is best. The -b flag means it will only apply when the MAC is on battery power. To make it work plugged in as well, change the -b to a -a. 
Finally, enjoy your blazing fast Mac. Edit: I also forgot to add that I get almost 2 hours more battery life with the SSD.",107,149,2011-06-30,AAPL,0.05330153554677963,0.9103955626487732,0.03630286827683449

I used the OWC DataDoubler mount, I know there are cheaper ways to go but I'm not too technically savvy and liked the open sturdy mount.

Installation was simple, I removed the battery just in case (picked up a security bit set from fleabay).
