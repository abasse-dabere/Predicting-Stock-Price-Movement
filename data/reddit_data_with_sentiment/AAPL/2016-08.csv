Big fonts are prevalent in iOS 10's Apple Music.

The emojis in iOS 10 have also now been redesigned to look even more three dimensional and have added shadows. One huge aspect of iOS 7 was the removal of shadows throughout the OS, so I'm not understanding the new emoji designs.

The new notifications are nice, but again, the cards are a reminiscent of the skeumorphic design of the iOS 6 notification banners.

apple,"Why I went back to Spotify, leaving Apple Music.","I will simply list the 3 top deal breakers for me.

     1) Stability: 

I have had multiple issues with stability of the mobile app, with regards to library saving/deleting/playlist erasing. Keep in mind when I say this, I know it may be at my own fault, but I am fairly proficient with iOS, so if it could happen to me it could happen to a lot of people.


     2) Ease of use:

Huge difference here in iOS. Spotify's left side drop in menu (iOS) feels more reliable than the drop down category from Apple Music.

Biggest deal breaker in this regard is the ability to download music for offline listening, Spotify is light years above Apple Music in this category. Specifically the ability to go to all songs in Spotify and download with one touch of the screen.

Now with desktop (macOS/OSX) I think Apple Music may edge out Spotify in my opinion, as the Spotify desktop app is slightly clunky with the social feed and advertisement for those of you who are not premium users.


     3) Playlists:

Spotify has excellent playlists in every genre, that are constantly updated, and it is also extremely easy to locate. The activity playlists are also excellent.

Apple Music's playlists are in my opinion complete shit, hard to navigate, and few and far between. It seems like a blatant attempt to answer to Spotify but with FAR from equitable results.


     I would love for anyone to weigh in and maybe those pro-Apple Music could make me see something that I don't already.

I've owned a fair share of Apple devices, but the iPad Pro 9,7"" is really something special. It's a phenomenal web browser, music player, book shelf, movie screen, reddit browser, gaming machine and the list just goes on.

With multitasking and picture in picture mode, I finally feel like the iPad has grown up. Today I bought a book in iBooks, read some of it while listening to the newest Blood Orange album on Apple Music. I later browsed reddit through the Narwhal app while also watching some of the Olympics via picture in picture mode.

apple,Why can't iOS automatically clear redundant notifications?,"I don't get this. So for instance, I'm in a Skype chat for work. People are sending a bunch of messages, so I swipe on one from the lock screen and get taken into Skype. I review all the messages, then back out to the home screen. If I pull down the Notification Center though, every single notification from that Skype chat (save for the one I swiped) is still there. Why? That doesn't make sense. Why isn't iOS smart enough to know that I've already reviewed all those messages in the app and clear the appropriate notifications?

Same thing happens in other apps, like Inbox or Airmail or Instagram. I'll clear out my new emails but all the notifications persist. I'll tap on one of several notifications relating to one image and *only* that notification clears. This is on the latest iOS 10 beta.

It doesn't make sense to me. In Messages, if I tap on one notification of several from a single conversation, all notifications from that conversation clear; any notifications from other unread conversations will stay until I read them. That's how it should work everywhere. I don't believe that it's simply that Instagram, Google and Microsoft are all too lazy to implement this kind of functionality â€” as well as every other app developer on my phone.

Also, I have an iPad and an iPhone. Why do I have to clear most notifications individually on both devices? Why doesn't it keep the Notification Centers in sync?",48,178,2016-08-12,AAPL,0.041747286915779114,0.9311983585357666,0.027054382488131523

apple,"Three months ago, my work gave a new MacBook Pro to the guy who hasn't used a Mac since the 80s. The Good, The Bad, and The Whiny: My Experiences From the Past Three Months.","(TLDR for the lazy: Excessively wordy man spends the past three months using a Mac for the first time since the Reagan Administration, likes some things but dislikes others)

My team at work has been doing a pretty hardcore dive into client-side WebDev lately, but (surprisingly) we didn't actually have our own Apple machines -- which made verifying our code works on Safari/iDevices just a *tiny bit* difficult.

So when we got the Powers that Be to requisition us a nice new MacBook Pro, they of course gave it to the one guy who hasn't actually touched a Mac since the days of Parachute Pants, Chernobyl, and Miami Vice.

It's been..interesting.

&amp;nbsp;

The Good Stuff:

 * The touchpad is *fucking phenomenal*.  Seriously, I'm blown away.  I was worried the lack of any ""real"" buttons would suck, but after a day or two of using it I flat out just *do not* want to go back to my old touchpads.
 * The overall OSX UI actually feels slick.  For the first time (to me, at least) the OS window animations don't feel obnoxious or like they're getting in my way (as opposed to how they feel so out of place in Windows).
 * The display itself is impressive.  Highest resolution I've ever worked with (even better than my home machine) and it's *still* incredibly clear.  Only complaint is that the glossy finish is a bit bad in high-light situations (ie the office -- matte finish would be nicer), but it hasn't been a major issue.
 * Getting the Safari Web Inspector to allow remote-debugging on an iPad was *light years* easier than getting Windows + Chrome to recognize my Nexus 7 (four restarts, eight different Android USB driver installs, sixteen rounds of Googling ""why can't Chrome see my tablet""...).
 * I don't know if it's general tech improvements everywhere or something Apple-specific, but the battery lasts two or three times longer than expected.  No more ""oh man, 40% battery -- someone toss me a charger before I shut down in 10 minutes"".
 * Really, the touchpad is awesome.
 * Boot Camp turned out to be easy to set up and use -- which is great since a bunch of my company's dev tools are Windows-only, so I still have to switch between OSX and Windows frequently.
 * On that note, and I only discovered this yesterday, VMWare lets me launch my Boot Camp partition *as a virtual machine*.  Finding out this was possible has **BLOWN MY DAMN MIND**, since it lets me jump between everything I need with a click instead of a reboot, but I'm still able to boot directly into Windows without losing anything I was working on while running it as a VM.
 * Changing Proxy settings on the fly has been surprisingly easy.  Seriously took me all of 15 minutes (and only one Google search) to get OSX happily acting as a remote-debugging middleman between my iPad and the base server running in my Windows VM.
 * Unrelated to my actual work (he says, while typing this post up at the office), but XCode seems to be pretty cool.  I've only spent a short time toying with it so far, but initial impressions are that it's pretty solid.  Might have to start looking at learning some Swift while I'm at it.
 * Have I mentioned how much I love the touchpad?

&amp;nbsp;

The Whiny ""I'm Still Really Used to Windows"" Stuff:

 * There's a whole host of right-click-to-do-things functionality I take for granted in Windows that just doesn't seem to exist in OSX.  For example, in Windows I can right-click -&gt; Run Program as Administrator and I'm good to go for elevated permissions.  OSX...notsomuch.  Is it safer that way?  Probably.  But on the other hand, it'd be nice to actually have the option and then get prompted for my root password like changing system preferences or sudo does.  Editing my Apache config files was a major pain in the ass, since if I made the mistake of opening it through Finder or in my already-open editor, I could edit whatever I wanted, but I didn't actually have high enough permissions to *save* any of those edits.
 * Another right-click example: why exactly does Finder not have a right-click -&gt; Create Text File option?  Create New File -&gt; Open with EditorOfChoice is (in my mind) way easier than Open Editor -&gt; wait shit I need the one with elevated permissions -&gt; Create New File -&gt; Save File As -&gt; clunkily navigate to desired location -&gt; Save.  Again, it's mainly personal preference, but it is kind of jarring after doing it the same way for so long in Windows.
 * On the subject of sudo (make me a sandwich), I'm finding myself using the Terminal way more than I thought I'd need to.  It's cool that I can do literally anything I want there, but sometimes I just want to click a blasted button instead of typing out a long-as-hell path -- especially if I'm doing the same minor thing to a bunch of similar items in different locations.  
 * Tab-Autocomplete of paths *below* the one you just typed in is pretty awesome (cd /Li[tab]We[tab]Do[tab] to get to /Libraries/WebServer/Documents is just amazing).  Windows seriously needs to catch the hell up on this one.
 * Minor, but it'd be nice if there were some sort of ""fullscreen but leave header menu visible"" option instead of ""fullscreen and hide everything but this window's contents"".  I like seeing the menu at the top, since I'm always clicking stuff there.
 * OSX doesn't natively recognize my mouse-thumb-buttons as ""go back/forward"".  I know I can install third-party software to make it work that way, but it bugs me a bit that it doesn't work out of the box (like it has since forever in Windows).
 * Command-S/X/C/V vs Ctrl-S/X/C/V is always going to rub me the wrong way.

&amp;nbsp;

The Bad Stuff:

 * The damn startup sound.  Doesn't care if I have my headphones plugged in, it ignores them and goes straight out the speakers.  Lots of fun when it's 6am and I just want to start working AND OH GOD I'M DEAF AND MY CATS ARE TERRIFIED AND MY ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD IS AWAKE.  If I have my headphones plugged in, then *nothing* should ever be coming out of the speakers.  Also, I shouldn't have to use obscure Terminal commands to disable it -- there needs to be an option somewhere in the system prefs to turn it off.
 * Honestly, the keyboard itself is kind of shit.  It looks and feels like a cheap-as-hell chicklet keyboard, which is weird since the rest of the machine looks/feels high-end.  Friend of mine actually swung by yesterday with an older MacBook he dug up from somewhere (2011ish?), and even though it's still a chicklet keyboard, it was just so much nicer/less cheap feeling.
 * Also, I miss having dedicated Home/End/Del/PgUp/PgDwn buttons.  I know it's become more of a universal ""laptops don't have those keys anymore"" thing, but it still slows me down a lot having to constantly remember ""oh wait, need to hold Fn and hit an arrow key"" when I'm trying to jump around quickly in my code.  An external keyboard helps, but that's still extra crap I need to lug around.
 * Last keyboard related issue -- it's making marks on my screen from where it touches while closed.  This genuinely bothers me.  I shouldn't have to carry around something extra to stick between the screen and keyboard just to prevent this from happening.
 * iOS Javascript scroll events make me want to die.  Especially inertial scrolling.  (Although to be fair, scroll events on every mobile platform seem to be a special kind of clusterfuck, not just iOS)
 * The Safari Web Inspector seems to be a bit...lacking.  I'm still learning more about how it works, but I'll be damned if I can find anything even remotely similar to all the the JQuery data/event/etc inspector plugins I rely on in Chrome.
 * I'm sorry to those few that may love it, but iTunes is a piece of shit.  It's better on the OSX side than the *steaming* pile of shit they grunted out for Windows (in that it doesn't use 100% of my resources for no reason), but it's still terrible.
 * The MacBook itself gets unpleasantly hot after a while, even when I'm not doing tons of stuff.  Almost to the point of going from ""laptop"" to ""burning-my-balls-off-top"".  I'm sure I'll enjoy this ""feature"" more come winter, but right now it's hot as hell out and I don't like roasted nuts in *any* season.
 * And of course the usual Mac complaint -- it's a good thing that my work paid for this thing, since *god damn* are they expensive.

&amp;nbsp;

The ""I'm Going To Kill Someone"" Stuff:

 * **Whatever damnable sadist decided that the Power button should be a regular key *directly above Delete* is a fucking asshole, and needs to be launched into the sun.**  If I fat-finger that damn key again, I just might actually kill someone.

&amp;nbsp;

My Verdict:

I don't think OSX can replace Windows as my primary OS for work, but a solid chunk of that is because too many of my dev tools are still Windows only.  I do like it enough that I am *definitely* sticking with my ""Boot to OSX, VMWare Windows"" plan (when battery allows -- running a VM sucks a lot of juice) instead of always booting to Windows and just jumping to OSX ""when I have to"".  I might even work on getting some of the smaller tools rewritten so they're more platform agnostic (ha ha ha, good luck to me there) so I don't need to move between OSes as often.

For home use, I game too much to realistically move away from Windows (things are improving with Steam and whatnot, but it's not quite there yet), but I might look into pricing out my own MacBook come next tax-return-season.

The best solution would be if Apple would (legally!) permit OSX to be run as a VM, since I'd definitely go that way if I could.

Overall impression though is that I do generally like the whole ""Mac Experience"" -- great improvements from my last experiences in the old Apple IIe days.  OSX wins in some places and Windows wins in others, but on the whole neither is clearly a better (or worse) option for what I do -- they're just...different.  

And I'm ok with that since I'm running both now and can have the best of both worlds.

Another cool concept would be scrolling through Facebook and seeing an advert for something on Amazon, by peeking you could dive straight into the Amazon mobile app and glance at the item and if you want to take a closer look you could pop right into it. 

Or what if a buddy texts you a link to a show on Netflix, instead of peeking into the link and having a look via safari, perhaps it could peek straight into Netflix and auto-play the trailer. Then popping would take you straight to the program'a page within the app.

That had my wallet firmly in my ass as I had to replace other more important things than rebuy a top spec retina 15"". I had to get a $200 Lenovo laptop from 2009 as the specs were decent for the no money I had. Not a bad machine actually... I still use it for retro windows gaming. One success. 

So I had the money after some good work come through for a low spec pro, mid spec Air or low spec ""Macbook 2"". I actually dont do a lot of hard stuff on macbooks so I got suckered into the Gold one as its fucking god damn beautiful. Too pretty, I don't care if its slower. I just couldn't wait any longer for a mac, Windows was driving me mad and every day was getting worse. I really wanted the MBP's to be out already but thats how it is.  

Anyways like most of us I was worried about a smaller screen and the processor but since I have 2 weeks to take it back if I dont like it it was worth a try. 

Simply put, its fucking excellent. The new skylakes are excellent. This is what I've had running at once on this 1.1ghz machine.

apple,iPhone 6S Plus stolen by Home Depot employee,"Last night I went shopping with my girlfriend for supplies at my local Home Depot in El Monte, CA towards the end of their closing hours before 9 PM. I had finished paying at the register number 6 at 8:51 PM and parked my electrical shopping cart by the vending machines, which is where I had mistakenly left my phone (I know, dumb mistake). This was a iPhone 6s Plus 128gb rose gold model with a tempered glass protector installed and the white Apple silicone case.

When I got into my car, my girlfriend asked if I had my phone. This is when I found out I had left it behind. I ran back into the store and asked the assistant manager if anyone had turned in a lost iPhone. He said no and asked his employees if they have seen it, which they all denied. 

My girlfriend and I began tracking the phone using find my friends and as we were refreshing the app, we noticed that the phone was moving throughout the store. We called it multiple times during this chase, but there was no answer. While refreshing the app, my girlfriend and I noticed my phone was moved out into the parking lot. We ran out and within moments, the phone was already driven out a couple blocks down before the thief had finally turned off my device. 

The manager informed me he asked the employee who moved the shopping cart I was using if she saw a phone, which she denied before she left. He apologized profusely and informed me that they would be checking the cameras the next morning. The El Monte police department was already closed by 9:15 PM, so I went home, turned on lost mode on my device and in the message I stated that the Home Depot cameras are being checked and that the police are being notified. If you turn this in, charges will not be pressed. I was hoping the thief would turn it on sometime if they weren't savvy enough so that I would get the location of their address, but it seems that it's either been off since last night, or that they have removed my sim card so that it will not connect to a network. 

Fast forward to today and after making a few phone calls to this particular Home Depot location, their lost prevention department informed me that they did in fact see an employee driving the electrical cart back to where it belonged with my phone physically inside of it, but they were unable to see on camera if this employee had actually pocketed it. They told me I would have to wait until Wednesday for them to interview the employee and conduct further investigation. I called Home Depot's corporate customer service number, where a helpful representative documented all of these details and helped to reach out to the store himself. When he returned to the phone with me, he told me that the particular associate that drove the electrical cart with my phone is not scheduled to work until tomorrow and that I would have to contact the store's manager after the interview is completed. I am going to file a police report after I get off work, which is in an hour after the time that this will be posted. I have my receipt from T-Mobile that shows I paid $1035.49 for my device. I believe this is classified as grand theft under California law which can be a felony.

My concern is, if the employee being interviewed denies knowing anything about my phone and the cameras are unable to clearly show her pocketing it, am I out of luck? Is Home Depot in any way responsible for the misconduct of their own employee while on their shift?

I will be posting regular updates as to what happens as I'm able to provide them.

&amp;nbsp;

**UPDATE #1 Aug 15, 2016 7:11 PM**

I just came back from the El Monte police department and they weren't of much help. I spoke to a cadet and officer, explained all the details to them and asked to file a report. They told me that there isn't anything that can be done and said that what happened is not theft, but abandoned property due to the fact that I left the phone behind and was no longer in the vicinity when the phone was retrieved by somebody else. I explained that this wasn't the case as I was actively tracking the phone down within Home Depot for at least 5 minutes using the Find My Friends app, called the phone multiple times while it was being moved, and placed a message on the lock screen with my girlfriend's number and to contact us while we were still in the store. They simply shrugged and said well, we will give you a case number and let us know if the thief ever turns the phone on to send you their location. I did not see the cadet fill any forms other than jotting a few notes down onto a post-it before sending me off. 

Is what I'm being told by the police accurate? That I abandoned my property and that I wasn't a victim of theft by finding? 

**UPDATE #2 Aug 16, 2016 2:15 PM**

I just got off a follow up phone call with the manager at Home Depot. I spoke with him because I was unable to get ahold of any loss prevention personnel as the original purpose of my call was to suggest checking  the parking lot cameras to identify the vehicle that exited the parking lot during the timeframe that I ran out into the lot to track my phone down. From my recollection, there was only one vehicle that exited the lot at the same time the phone moved out of the lot on Find My Friends. The manager during that night, my girlfriend and I witnessed a male employee entering the passenger side of the vehicle. The driver was a female who was also confirmed to be an employee by this manager.

The manager I spoke with today assured me that the lost prevention personnel are probably already looking into all of this and to call back around 6:30-7:00 PM as the employee to be interviewed is not scheduled to work until 6:00 PM. He also assured me that the loss prevention employee himself is **almost positive** that the employee in question is the one who took my phone. The key now is for loss prevention to use the questioning techniques that /u/mredofcourse has pointed out below in getting her to return my phone. 

I will call them back at 7:00 PM PST tonight and update you guys on how this pans out.

**UPDATE #3 (WARNING: LONG) Aug 16, 2016 10:15 PM**

At 6:45 PM, I received a phone call from the manager at Home Depot telling me the interview has been completed and that the employee confessed to taking the phone. They informed me that she said she has sold the phone on OfferUp. I told him that I was heading straight to the EMPD and that I was going to try to bring an officer with me to obtain a report.

I spoke with a different officer at the station this afternoon. I explained all the details once again and that this time I had a confession. However.. he gave me the entire talk again about how I technically ""abandoned"" the phone. He said that due to the fact that I left the phone behind and left into the parking lot, what had happened was that she discovered the phone and did not ""steal"" it. I interjected that this should actually be a misappropriation of lost property and he replied telling me to be careful about how I phrase things and that what I stated is a very gray area. Finally, he refused to send an officer to accompany me to obtain her information or to take a report. I said I would need some sort of police documentation to present to a small claims judge and he said the EMPD card with my case number is all he would be able to provide.

After sending me off, I headed to the Home Depot to obtain the girl's information. Upon arriving, they told me she had been terminated and that legally, they could not detain her. They also said legally, they can only release any of the girl's information to the police. Subsequently, I called the EMPD and explained the situation to a different cop who sent a detective over this time.

The detective arrived half an hour later and met with the manager and myself. The manager explained that loss prevention was gone and that they are the only ones with access to the interview statement and security footage. I was instructed to return tomorrow with a different officer so that Home Depot can provide them with all the information that I need. 

**EDIT:** I'm not having it that the police are telling me that finders, keepers is the law. Upon further research, I see that common law distinguishes abandonment of property from mislaid property. Mislaid property is property intentionally left in a location where it's true owner forgets to retrieve it. Abandonment of property is any personal property left by it's owner who *intentionally* relinquishes all rights to it's control. Am I onto something here or is this still a ""gray area"" that won't help me? [Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lost_property)

**UPDATE #4 Aug 17, 2016 7:26 PM**

Just finished up at the Home Depot with a new officer who was extremely helpful this time. The difference was night and day. She took a serious and detailed report, retrieved all information from Home Depot's loss prevention, and asked if my end goal was to press charges. I told her that if the girl was willing to pay me the fair market value of my phone of $750 (which I feel is very lenient for a like new condition 128gb iPhone 6s Plus, $40 case, a new $20 sim card from T-Mobile, and my troubles), I would drop it and not press charges. 

The officer went to her home to inform her of my offer, but either no one was home or she chose to ignore the police. The officer told me that she will return once more tomorrow to try a second time, but if there is no luck, we can attempt prosecution.",159,219,2016-08-15,AAPL,0.08417564257979393,0.8864455819129944,0.0293787969276309

apple,"Apple should either reintroduce Safari to Windows, or add an iCloud Keychain function to iCloud for Windows","With personal security becoming more and more important, primarily avoiding reusing passwords, I've been making more use of my password managers to generate unique, complex passwords for different sites/accounts. It would be impossible to remember all these randomly-generated passwords without these managers. While most password managers work well in Windows (at least with Chrome), they're still clunky on iOS, and nowhere near as fluid and easy as iCloud Keychain. I also prefer the passwords generated by iCloud Keychain, as they seemingly contain a wider range of characters than the other managers I've used. The only problem is iCloud Keychain isn't accessible on Windows at all.

Safari hasn't been available on Windows for a long time, however Apple has an application for iCloud on Windows. I'd wager at least two thirds of all iOS users probably own a Windows PC, so it makes sense to cater to that market to a point. Right now, the only solution to use iCloud Keychain as your only password manager is to look up passwords on an iOS device, and type them manually into your browser on your PC, which is obviously a clumsy way of doing things, albeit possibly more secure in a roundabout way.

Since Apple already maintains the iCloud utility for Windows, I think the easiest (and obvious) way to implement iCloud Keychain on Windows is to merge it to the iCloud utility. While I know Safari on Windows is likely dead, I wouldn't mind seeing it come back now that we have Handoff/Continuity to access open tabs and history across all iCloud devices.

apple,"At first glance, the new Apple Music and iOS 10 as a wholeâ€”looked unsatisfactorily ugly and huge, but it really grows on you after a bit","Although the old Apple Music design and the sharp aesthetics of the Control Center looked more professional and modern, the new bold and rounded design does grow on you. It pains me to look back at the old design though, it makes me wish Apple didn't go down this route, but at least you get used to it.

The bold design fits the best in Apple Music and Home, definitely took some design cues from Spotify and Airbnb. The new look is definitely more hip and flashy, the Now Playing looks more child-like and I missed how the album art blends with the panes... but I also love how big and bold the music titles are and the buttons. It's way easier to control your music while in the car.

The new Control Center will never be as sleek and modern or definitely more professional-looking than what we used to have. I got used to the big ass buttons, until I looked at it on my 12.9"" iPad Pro... anyway, I'm still not over how impractical it is to have separate panes for music and quick toggles... sure it seems more logical to have less clutter and more organization in the head... but it's more of a step backwards, and the new Control Center is no longer the one tap access as it used to be.

apple,"Is this ""Google Earth Update Helper"" pop-up legit? (image link inside)","http://imgur.com/a/PB8F1

It just started this evening, shortly after possibly visiting a less-than-legitimate site.  A Google search (per the Rules of the sub) comes up blank, leading me to believe I picked up some malware.

I *had* GE, but decided to delete it to see if these pop-ups (about once/30 min) would go away.  In fact, when I went to delete, Finder gave me a pop-up asking for permission to delete.  Once deleted, the pop-up appeared anyway.

This might be a new thing.  TIA for any insight.

apple,Looking for beta testers for an app that lets you create collaborative playlists on Apple Music,"Over the course of 6 months I've been developing an app called Mixmate that lets you create, share and collaborate on playlists with your friends via Apple Music. Collaborative playlists are a feature I really missed when switching over from Spotify, so I decided to fill the gap. There's a video of it in action on the [website here](https://lukelau.me/mixmate), and here's some screenshots:

At its core it's really simple; it doesn't even have any playback controls since I figured it would just be easier to swipe up for control centre. But it's built to have extensive native support, and has cool stuff like Spotlight search, CloudKit syncing, 3D Touch and [iOS 10's rich notifications](http://fcdn.macrumors.com/data/attachments/561/561006-2c9b86aa8473376ea0b7de0aab4b859a.jpg).

apple,"With the next iPhone dropping the 3.5mm jack, would now not be the best time to drop Lightning too in favour of USB-C?","Apple is using USB-C on the MacBook, likely on the future MacBook Pro, and hopefully for the iPad Pro too.

With all laptops trending towards USB-C as the ""one port to rule them all"", and Android phones converting to USB-C, Apple has an opportunity to ensure that USB-C becomes the port for everything.

No longer would you have to worry about what charger for what device, because all smartphones, tablets, and laptops would use USB-C!

The loss of the 3.5mm would be less of a big deal because in the future, *all* earphones would be USB-C, and USB-C earphones would work on *all* of your devices.

But right now, if they drop the 3.5mm but *keep* Lightning, you'll have to have a separate pair of earphones for iOS devices and for *every single other device*, whereas at least if they go with USB-C, it'll work in future with all other Android phones.

Worse, if major Android phones drop 3.5mm, then you'll have to have *3* different types of earphones. Total and utter fragmentation for the consumer.

The reason to switch to USB-C ***now*** is that if they don't, people will buy Lightning earphones and headphones which will become completely useless in future.

For me, this feels like an ""either you go the full way, or you do nothing"" scenario.

Keeping the 3.5mm jack would be great! But we know Apple are killing it.

So IMO, it would be the worst of both worlds to kill 3.5mm but keep Lightning. At least if they do it all at once, they can go through one generation of ""consumer pain"" but pave the way for a bright and simple future where every device uses USB-C and nothing else.

USB-C could become the universal connector for.... everything. But Lightning is the stubborn mule in this vision of the future.",759,1595,2016-08-21,AAPL,0.1229444146156311,0.8554788827896118,0.021576641127467155

apple,I checked out the Galaxy Note 7 today...,"It's impressive!

I'm an avid Apple user, but I really think in some ways the Note 7 is the better phone this year. Since we basically know most of the details of the iPhone 7... same form factor, slightly different back plate, upgraded cameras, no headphone jack, etc., it's fun to go see what Samsung cooked up. 

I will say I didn't get far with their UI. I've never been a fan of touchwiz, or whatever they call it now. 

But the screen! This may be the biggest difference for me, and why I won't upgrade from an iPhone 6 Plus to a 7 Plus. The Note 7 screen is pretty incredible. Edge to edge, small bezels at the top and bottom. The curve is much easier on the eyes than the S6 Edge. And the AMOLED screen looks very nice. I'm waiting for an iPhone with an OLED screen.

Now when I pick up my 6 Plus, I'm shocked at how much I notice the bezels now.

Here's to a bezel-less OLED iPhone 8 (or whatever they call it!",317,84,2016-08-21,AAPL,0.0163529422134161,0.8716696500778198,0.11197736114263535
apple,Apps &amp; websites that redirect you to the App Store without your consentâ€”has got to go!!,"I have had enough of websites low-key trick me into pressing a button that ends up redirecting me to the App Store. *For example: www.younow.com â€” clicking on an old stream that shows you a thumbnail and play button (similar to that of a default video player) redirects you to the App Store. So inconvenient and such a waste of time and space!* Not all things need to be apps.

Also that grey bar underneath the URL bar that shows you there's an app variant of the website? Yeah, that's got to go too. Waste of screen real estate, also stupid, the fact that I have the app downloaded and the website tells me there's an app version of it... like motherfucker I know that fucking shit.

I just wanted to quickly note that connecting web links to apps is a waste of time as well, you have to wait for the app to open then it has to load the content you want to go in... and it's like... if I wanted to do that shit, I would've gone to the app itself. It's so unnecessary, it's even worse if you are on an older phone where the wait time for the app to boot up is fucking notorious.

If an app isn't installed on your phone, then the websites shouldn't have the right to redirect you to the App Store without your consent.

And when apps like Facebook mauls you with third party app notifications to apps you don't have fucking installed and it sends you to the App Store... fucking no. I hate Facebook taking advantage of this.

So my most heated frustration that made me make this thread was when a notification in my notifications tab (on the Facebook app) says: *Kiwi: Tim Cook sent you a request* and when I click it, it automatically opens the App Store. And there are two problems with this...

1) Facebook doesn't inform me it's not even a notification from FACEBOOK, and that it's a third party app, it doesn't tell me it's going to send me to the App Store, the notification makes me believe it's an in-app notification. So sneaky of Facebook.

*FOR CONTEXT: https://imgur.com/a/hv8lt*

2) The app isn't even on my phone or even purchased! Nor have I opened any sort of Kiwi app, making me believe it was only sent to me from a friend. This bullshit shouldn't be allowed, they should just inform you what is relevant to Facebook.

I didn't even bother with wondering what the notification was about, my ""OCD"" told me to click it to make it an unread notification (remove the blue highlight) out of compulsion, and poof I was in the App Store.

[NEW TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcydRwO8tqA)

Over a year since the game was titled [Winner of moray game jam](https://vimeo.com/149030374) the game is now expected to finally be released on iOS in the coming days.
It is currently LIVE on the google play store, and I thought I would share with you all my progress on the games development since [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4dqscb/a_game_jam_win_and_a_year_later_my_first_large/) post
a few months back. In short, its getting a re release. I wont go into too much detail as there is a fair read on the previous post linked above, but 
the game is now polished with improved graphics and UI. 

This past year has been pretty nuts for myself, I'm still at university and just got an undergraduate in Computer Science Application Software Development, during this time I worked part time with a game studio, managed to get a 
distinction in my degree, Won British computer science undergraduate of the year and most importantly - and far more relevant - started taking game development more seriously by kick starting my own company!

**WHAT NOW**

CJG Studio which is currently a game dev and web dev buisness. You can visit the site cjgstudio.com to get an idea :) 
Nothing was satisfying me, I've been tinkering with games since I was 14, when I was 16 I got an internship as a programmer at a studio which kick started it all and I've only recently come to realise this is what I want to do,
I dont want to work for a large software dev buisness and 'farm' out code. Funding is my issue, which is why ive put my heart into this project, and hope it can provide some entertainment to the community. I had a soft launch earlier this 
year which went OK. I was featured in some articles and magazines... but not much sales, this was only on android so now its out TOMORROW 9AM GMT ON IOS &lt;3 

Marketing is bloody hard, I think ive done an ok job with what I had. I slowly stopped marketing last month and only recently had to pick it up again.... read on as to why :'(

The sheer amount of work that goes into everything is phenomenal. It takes about two days to release on iOS and getting it built and submitted. Android is slightly easier, if you want the graphics to actually look semi professional it takes this amount of time. Coding is the fun part, I soon found myself being the developer behind a game I thoroughly enjoy playing. So when I wanted to do something or questioned myself ""wouldnt it be cool if he could like slow time and dodge boids like in the matrix"" yes it would be cool.... so i made it happen. To put it into perspective, its like youre playing one of your favourite games and have access to the cheat code terminal, instead you can have any cheat you want to make it more fun!

**THE MAIN SETBACK**
SO the reason my marketing strategy has slowed, to basically nothing, is because I had a contract with a publisher. The plan was for them to release and market the game while I focus on development. We were looking at a VR port
by xmas and a steam build by end of Jan (depending on how funding goes, id love to still do this!) however, due to a personal issue on the publishers side (someone high up left the company with all the 
contacts to the media with him), I terminated the agreement. YES they broke the contract by not being able
keep the promises made.. and I move quickly, so for a position like his to just disappear from the company was a set back. I just terminated and cried.. and then moved on and now we are here! Doing it indie - lets see how this goes.

I really REALLY hope someone can get some entertainment from the game
ive tried to create a relaxed, minimal environment that should help you destress while travelling, or even if you just want to kill a few minutes!

If you want to see how I developed the game then [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6kTaUYqvLM&amp;list=PLc7HmW41t8ntTj-F7OtLpOLfevbs0mtxc) is a development log series I started :)

apple,"MacBook Pro stolen in Australia, turns up at a Paris Apple Store 6 months later for product support. How to proceed?","Hey all,

Apologies in advance if I'm in the wrong place - don't think this contravenes the rules. Somewhat of an interesting series of events and discussion around what Apple can do to recover stolen products.

In Jan 2015 my MacBook Pro was stolen from my apartment in Australia. Reported to police, tracked on Find My iPhone, all the usual stuff. Was password-protected so I assume because no-one could log in to my account, it would never reach the internet to show up on Find My iPhone (never did show up, as it were).

Fast-forward to today, I'm perusing my Apple Support profile, and I see a support query has been logged, written in French. Called Apple, and they tell me someone has taken it to a Paris Apple store for support. From my discussion with Apple support, they have further information about the device and its location, but they are refusing to pass any further details to me, and then tried to backtrack on what was already told. 

To me, this seems unreasonable, as I am proven to be the owner of the device. Do I have any further routes to obtain this information, and do you think Apple has a responsibility to provide further support?",258,1168,2016-08-26,AAPL,0.07452713698148727,0.8939355611801147,0.03153735399246216

apple,About 'Touch Disease' and your iphone,"There is so much misinformation floating around. I don't know all the answers, but I gotta clarify a few things here because all these comments getting mad or worried or whatever are missing a lot of key points

Edit: let me make a quick edit here at the start of the post since plenty of folks are misinterpreting me here. Like I say throughout this post, I'm not trying to justify Apple's current stance of charging for touch disease swaps. All I'm trying to do is make sure people know how bends in iPhones work. I do think there should be a quality program personally, but my personal opinion does not change the facts about this issue. So learn the facts about bends, and go from there. 


**First** of all. If you bought a new iphone 6 or 6+, you will not experience 'touch disease' without bending your phone. 


**Second**, 11% of iphone REPAIRS are affected by touch disease, not Iphones. Its NOT as common as reddit makes you think.


**Third**, If your phone is bent at a minor 1 degree, it was bent FURTHER than 1 degree in order to get it to REST at 1 degree. So no, your minor bend probably isn't 'so small it shouldn't even matter.' 
Now I don't mean to say Apple shouldn't have been more careful in how they made the phone (aka a 'bend buffer' if you will). I mean that your 'very minor bend' can and probably did cause the touch disease issue youre experiencing.


**fourth**, Some genius bar repair iphones are affected by this touch disease because they are re manufactured, not new. This is NOT refurbished. It's never touched another customer before. BUT, it could have a logic board put in it that encountered damage leading to touch disease that was undetected in its testing process. Let me reiterate though. NEW PHONES WILL NOT HAVE TOUCH DISEASE PRIOR TO A BEND! 

I've talked to other geniuses, I've talked to engineers via escalations, I've talked with management in touch with their higher ups. This issue is caused by logic board damage. And if you haven't opened your phone, exposed it to liquid, or bent the enclosure, you won't experience this issue.


**Fifth**, Your phone isn't bent and you experience the issue? Youre phone is/was bent. You either can't see it, or it flexed back to a straight position after being bent. Yes. I agree. Such a small fucking bend is bullshit that it causes this problem. But guess what. It's the cause for it. Or you got an unlucky genius bar swap. But don't get upset at the genius when you come back to get that phone swapped again. It's not their fault.


**Sixth**, bends happen mainly over time. If a drop is powerful enough to bend the phone, its gonna get very obviously damaged/cracked/bent. Slight bends happen slowly over time. 


**Seventh**. Cases will not help you like you think they will. Can you bend the case? Ok, Then the phone can bend in the case.
 

**Finally**. Throw away any information I gave about 'why' touch disease occurs or whatever, if you want to. But don't ignore what I said about phones that bend and how they bend and why a minor bend was probably more severe as it was happening. Because so many people just assume that if they can't see the bend without closing one eye and squinting, that it's not a problem. 


again, I'm not here to tell you to not be mad that the phones get bent, or that apple doesn't have a quality program, or whatever. I'm literally just here to inform you about what bends look like and why they can be more severe than they appear.

Edit again: as far as I'm aware, ""touch disease"" only affects 6+ phones. I have yet to hear or see personally a 6 or any s phone with this issue. So for everyone worried about their S phones or their 6's with multi touch issues WITHOUT flickering flashing lines, it's likely not touch disease.",330,489,2016-08-27,AAPL,0.151884526014328,0.8225805163383484,0.025534912943840027

apple,Steve Jobs on leaving old technology behind (1991),"&gt;Jobs: My experience has been that creating a compelling new technology is so much harder than you think it will be that you're almost dead when you get to the other shore. That's why, when you take big leaps, like the Mac, or object-oriented programming, or handwriting recognition, you have to leave old technology behind. When Lindbergh was going to fly from New York to Paris, he had to decide what to take with him. There were a lot of demands. They fell into two categories -- things that would make his journey safer or more comfortable, and things that would increase his chances of making it to Paris. Weight was a real problem. He could take more gas, which would increase his safety, or he could take a compass, which would increase his chances of getting to Paris. Every time he came down on the side of increasing his chances of getting to Paris at the sacrifice of safety or comfort. That's why he made it.

apple,Its 2016. We should expect more from iCloud,"I decided to do a factory reset and start fresh. It didn't re-install my photos (found out thats to be expected), so I reset again and started from the other mornings iCloud backup.
Its been a nightmare. Some apps install, some don't. It will hang and do nothing for 4 hours. I just leave my phone at home so it can continue the backup. Sometimes it quits so I have to restart my phone several times to get it to start the restore correctly.
I ended up deleting all my apps so it would start on my pictures. I'll just download them later. But the pictures will not restore correctly. It just skips around to various places and gets different pictures. Currently I have around 20% of my pictures over a 2 day period. 
The first problem is that apple says it takes between 1-4 hours per GB. OK. It is what it is. Accept that if you have a top storage device, it will take you up to 2 weeks to get your info back.
The second, larger problem. Apple support basically says its erratic on how it installs, just like what I'm experiencing. 
I've currently restarted the phone 4 times and I can't get it to start the restore on the photos again. I don't know what to do at this point. I guess I can try to delete the phone again and hope it does it correctly, but I don't have any hope. $2.99 a month for total storage seems like a small price, but if the service doesn't work, its useless to me.
I realize I should have backed up to the computer. I was going to, but it said backing up would delete previous backups. Thats ridiculous. I'm paying money for my iCloud backup. Keep it just in case.

apple,"Dear Apple: Please ban ""generic"" release notes for apps.","Seriously. I really feel like Facebook started the whole trend of ""We update our app regularly"" boilerplate text that appears in place of proper release notes every time a new version is released, but it's spreading like wildfire and more and more developers have adopted this stupid, extremely lazy practice. Expedia seems to be the latest convert:

&gt; With your travel needs in mind, we're regularly updating our app to make it even better than the award-winning app you're used to! Make sure to download the latest version to take advantage of it all. 

***THESE ARE NOT RELEASE NOTES. THIS IS IN NO WAY HELPFUL OR USEFUL INFORMATION DESCRIBING THE UPDATES/FIXES IN A NEW SOFTWARE VERSION.***

apple,"PSA: ""Update Later"" prevents alarms from ringing","Perhaps this is old news, but it happened to me this morning.

I set my alarm for 8:21am before going to bed, but woke up at 8:35 (whew) with the phone on the ""Update Complete"" screen, after which was the iCloud login screen. The alram **did not** ring. 

Edit: I have an iPhone 6s

Edit 2: Judging from the replies, it seems like a bug. I urge everyone to report it so that it's looked into!
