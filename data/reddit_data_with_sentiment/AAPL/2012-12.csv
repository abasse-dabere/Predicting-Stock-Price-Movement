apple,Is it wise to upgrade the RAM myself on a new MBP?,"I'm looking to purchase a new 13"" Macbook Pro, which comes standard with 4GB of RAM. Upgrading to 8GB costs $90 with the student discout, but I'm wondering if I can save some money by purchasing 8GB of RAM separately and installing them myself (the savings would be around $60.) 

I found [this tutorial](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/392) on how to upgrade RAM yourself, and it looks fairly straightforward. 

Still, I don't hear a lot about people upgrading their own RAM on their MBPs. Any advice would help. Thanks in advance.",251,221,2012-12-03,AAPL,0.013995328918099403,0.8077728748321533,0.17823180556297302
apple,Apple apps aging process (where are the developers?),"Most of us already know that there are some Apple apps out there that are 3 or more years old, or even less, and they feel really aged in nowadays systems.

My question is: where are the debs? Apple, I imagine, might have thousands of hired developers, gathered in teams according to each application and such, but we still see some flawed of aged apps that receive no treatment at all.

For example:

*iPhoto*. Its design really looks bad next to the rest of the system. The use of a different font makes it look cheap, and gestures never work as expected from an Apple app. The chosen colors look misplaced, the sidebar too, etc.

*iWork*. Maybe the oldest of the “current” apps. It still works great, no problems at all, but certainly it doesn't looks and feels like current-gen software. and could use much tweaking.

*Dashboard*. How can a troop of 1000 devs not care about such a potentially useful app?

*Finder*. It looks and works ok, but it could be much more with such simple tweaks as easy iCloud access, iOS integration with AirDrop, tabs, etc. 

And so on…

On the other side, apps like iMovie and GarageBand seem to never look old. Maybe because of their more consistent design and overall superior quality compared to the rest of the suite? I can't imagine in what way Apple could update iMovie, for example, optimizations aside.

iphone,"Minimalist iPhone 5 case on kickstarter, my very first product after 10 years  and 2 design degrees...","I been a Reddit lurker for 2 years now. I am not sure if I can be called a Redditor since I just read and upvote, downvote. I am a frequent lurker and fervent reader of the front page and the nosleep sub-reddit, they are my lullaby before I really shut my eyes for the day.

Today I received an e-mail from kickstarter saying they have approved my project: the RADIUS case for iPhone and I would love to share this project with the Reddit community and I would be honored to answer any questions you have about the project and my journey to get there. And of course, your pledge and support will be very very much needed and appreciated.

Short story: My sister (a stay at home mom) wanted to start a business, asked me if I can design an iPhone case for her so she can make it and sell and get some cash for her growing family (new baby girl). I start sketching and 6 months and many turn downs from CNC machinists later (they say the case is too expensive and not manufacture-able) we finally launch on kickstarter.com

The team is basically myself, my best friend and my sister. We don't have any experience in doing this, so you will see that the video presentation is not quite ""there"". I didn't sleep for a week when the video was shot, I had to drive 20 hours to be at my other teammate's house because he has the video equipment and the DSLR to shoot the prototypes. 

So please check the project on kickstarter out, if you have an iphone 5 and like it, please support us and pledge, if not please help spread the project to your colleague, friends, family!

As I said above, I would be happy to share my experience for the project and our journey to get it to kickstarter.

Upvotes, comments, all appreciated!

UPDATE:

I really appreciate all of the comments and feedback here! Thank you for the support and criticism and the pledges! I will try my best to get the testing video done and post it, it might take me a while because we are still adjusting the inner linings to have the best result. Thanks again everyone!

UPDATE 2:

UPDATE 3:

Hi all, I have been busy with all the e-mails and responses and have to take care of some personal matters. Also since the project is getting closer to reality, we start to look at packaging and other issues. I have to help with this because I am the only one that really have any idea about it. I also been in touch with my prototyper and 3M, the material company to see which material works best with low profile. With this thin design, it will obviously not have the protection that a conventional case would have. The meeting with them in next week, and I will start to do my own tests with various types of methods. Will keep you updated. Again, thanks for all the feedback and support, and also the criticism. It's all good, I am excited as heck and also anxious to be honest... 


UPDATE 4:

A big thank you, and heartfelt appreciation to all of the support from everyone here, and especially to the Redditors that like the case and backed us! You guys/gals are awesome! 
http://i.imgur.com/FkqVm.jpg (this is two weeks ago, recently we have gotten a few more)

I met with the manufacturer yesterday and we talked about all of the feedback I received here and other places. Most notable issues: 
1. The level of impact protection 
2. Scuffing due to the X frame
3. Comfort of the X frame
4. Keeping cost down

We will address all of those issues in a final master prototype, while keeping the idea the same. Minor improvements, making things better, stronger and different types of finishing to make things smoother. The change will have to be minor and does not affect the design/change the appearance much. The 3M materials have yet to arrive, I will make another update on that when I received it. 

Thanks again and please continue to help us spread the word. If you or anyone you know want to start a kickstarter project, feel free to ask anything or PM me, I will talk to you on the whole process we went through and any questions you have.",211,270,2012-12-06,AAPL,0.029614774510264397,0.9286711812019348,0.041714031249284744

People sharing news, information, apps they've made, people seeking advice... All of it is perfectly acceptable and respectable content. I fail to see justification in the type of response they're getting. Shit like this is why so many people avoid this subreddit, and even more people hate reddit in general. Getting all of your posts downvoted isn't exactly great motivation for people to continue contributing to this subreddit. This pointless trolling has got to stop. It's just not funny. Downvoting good stuff and trolling in comments (happens to me all the time) does not make you better than the OP. it just makes you a troll. Nobody likes trolls.

* [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id443987910?mt=12) (a bit expensive, but sure beats keeping sticky notes for all my accounts)

* [Coda 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda-2/id499340368?mt=12) (for the developers out there)

* HootSuite (wrapper app- http://help.hootsuite.com/entries/241907-what-is-hootsuite-desktop-fluid- for tweeters)

Books with video built into them (Math) to explain concepts, because it is digital you can carry it all around without the weight, you can do the problems without worrying about writing in the book or bending pages, BEAUTIFUL layouts and organization.. I don't know what else to say about how awesome the textbook section is, yet it is really buried within the store.

I have not paid for a full price textbook mostly because there are a lot of FREE TEXTBOOKS there! This was why I wanted an iPad to begin with and I'm sad to see Apple not really pushing their textbook potential especially now with the mini.

I went in and asked about price protection, seeing as I bought my phone only 7 days ago. They refunded the difference to me. 

Again, this might be regional, so YMMV. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention, some Best Buys have a strange policy regarding the return process, so if you're in a state with sales tax, you might get the price difference *and* the sales tax back! So on my 32GB 5, I ended up getting $100 back instead of the $50. Not sure if it was an error on their part (Rep said it was a loophole in their system, and there's no way for them to get around it or they could possibly get in deep shit, so they *had* to give me the tax back. Not sure how true this is), but you just might get more than you bargained for back.

apple,Street names in new Google Maps for iOS are a mess.,"I just tried out turn-by-turn navigation in San Francisco, and the Google Maps app really has a propensity for calling streets by obscure secondary names. 
It insists that Lombard St. is ""El Camino Real."" 
It thinks that Polk St by City Hall is called ""Dr Carlton B Goodlett Place."" 
When I was on Market St. by Page, it told me I was on ""San Francisco Bicycle Route 30."" 
The turn from Market to Valencia is ""San Francisco Bicycle Route 545."" While all of these alternate names are technically on the books, they shouldn't be appearing in turn-by-turn directions. I'm not impressed.",46,76,2012-12-14,AAPL,0.03604435175657272,0.9271649122238159,0.03679077327251434
apple,"Not a fanboy, bought a mini received it today, here are my thoughts.","Before I begin, I would like to add that I am typing this whole thing from the ipad mini keyboard. I will let you know in the middle of the review if/when typing on this thing gets old, so far it's okay.

Where to begin. Oh yes! I have been debating purchasing a tablet for some time now (began my search around July) and after playing with a lot of the tablets that were out on the market at the time and at a fairly low budget, was sold on the nexus7. Wasn't the greatest, I didn't like the feel of it (forgive me, the grip on the back is nice, but even at 200 dollars that is till enough of an investment for me to purchase a protective case so that wasn't a deciding factor) but at that point I was willing to ""settle"" for the okay price point and hardware. Now mind you, I had used an ipad before as a comparison. The keyboard size was perfect for me but as far as the size and weight of the rest of the product I did not enjoy it as much. Fast forward after the initial excitement of hearing an ipad mini was about to enter the market I decided to go to my local apple store and play with it for a few minutes.
(Off topic typing update: typing is still okay, I just notice I miss the space bar with my thumbs sometimes.)

After about 20 minutes of playing with it, I'm sold. The quality feels much nicer and stronger than the rubbery plastic feel of the nexus 7. I go to purchase it and they are sold out for weeeeeks (of the 16g wifi model, they had 64g models but they were too much for my budget.) I finally bucked up and decided to purchase one online which shipped and arrived almost a week earlier than expected (awesome!)

Now for the important things.

Everything runs very smooth, there is no lag in between and actions. Even after letting a lot of programs run in the background, nothing. Zilch. I did purchase a case with a triangular folding cover to make typing a little big easier with the angle. 

The speakers work great, better than expected actually. And still the size of it I still feel is perfect for reading or browsing the web.

One thing I know that is on a lot of people's minds is the retina display. I have a 3rd generation iPod touch I purchased right when it came out. I have played with the 4th generation ipad and seen the new retina display. My take on it: we were fine without it before, it's just fine without it on the mini. I also do a lot of research before making purchases like this, and I'm happy to say that it wasn't all talk on blog reviews, the way they described it fits my needs perfectly.

So yes. For anyone looking to purchase on of these I would most definitely if you find the ipad to be too big for you. 
Btw I used the landscape angle to do this typing, not the vertical style with the thumb texting, I felt it would have taken too long that way. Plus this I how I would like to get used to using this thing so I may as well get as much practice in as possible.

Just my two cents yawl. Thanks for reading!",51,75,2012-12-14,AAPL,0.03476974740624428,0.9249266982078552,0.04030349850654602

I don't feel the same urge this time around. Of course I experience some device envy when I hold a 5 and feel how light and sleek it is, but I don't feel like the 4 is lacking in any way. The battery life is the best of any iPhone to date, the Retina display looks good as ever, and iOS 6 is pretty damn responsive (if not buttery smooth like on the 5).

iphone,Want your iPhone to ring longer before going to voicemail?,"For a long time, I've wanted my iPhone to ring for longer than the standard 20ish seconds. I looked around for an answer and found one you can do WITHOUT being jailbroken.

Dial \*#61#

The following text will appear:
Setting Interrogation Succeeded
Voice Call Forwarding
When Unanswered
Forwards to +1XXXXXXXXXX Enabled (the 1XXXXXXXXXX is an actual number...write that number down, you'll need it).

Then dial \*61\*+1XXXXXXXXXX\*11\*tt# Of course use the number you wrote down instead of the Xs. You'll need the plus sign too...hold down 0.  Instead of ""tt"" put in the amount of time you want your phone to ring for with a max of 40 seconds I believe, then press send. For example, I keyed in \*61\*+18324219997\*11\*30#

Once completed, this should appear on the screen:
Setting Activation Succeeded
Voice Call Forwarding
When Unanswered

Your phone will now ring longer before going to voicemail.

Not sure if anyone else wanted to do this, I didn't see any posts about this in this sub so I figured I'd share this technique.

EDIT: This apparently does not work with CDMA iPhones.  I apologize for not looking into this before posting.
EDIT 2: Trying to find answers for the CDMA users, and it does not appear this is an option.

apple,Best ML bug Ever!!!,"I was on my MacBook just now and discovered one of the most awesome bugs ever. Its so elegent in fact, that I'm starting to think it may not actually be a bug at all.

1. Open an application of your choice.

2. Minimise the window using either the minimise button or the ⌘+M shortcut.

3. Then click on the minimised application's icon in the dock, and use the hide shortcut ⌘+H *while the zoom animation is still in process*. The animation will freeze, however the application remains usable! Try scrolling around using the trackpad and watching the application morph.

In order to restore the window to normal...

1. Minimise it again.
2. Reopen it by clicking its (now deformed) icon in the dock.
3. Click on the (still deformed) icon that remain in the dock.

I hope you guys have fun with this utterly useless bug.

Step 2. Go to http://dailydeals.eamobile.com/mcs/publish/3161/44175 and select Daily Spin. Win a free game, and enter your trashmail email you made in Step 1. 


Step 3. After you've received your email with the code for the free game, go into you settings app &gt; Safari &gt; Clear Cookies and Data. 


Step 4. You can now go back to EA's website and spin to win another game with a new trashmail email address. Repeat until you have all the games you want from the free give-away.

apple,My Apple Christmas surprise.,"During Christmas this year my dad and I thought it would be a wonderful idea to get my mother a new  iPad since her old HP laptop was dying. So we went to target and got her an iPad 2 for $50 off it's normal price. This morning when she opened the present and we looked at it I noticed it had a lightening(OOPS!) port on it. Curious I googled the model# and to my surprise recieved a link for the 4th Gen iPad retina. The target store by accident had given us a iPad retina for $150 less then what it normally costs... Just thought I would share this nice surprise with you all. Merry christmas, and if you don't celebrate it, Happy Holidays.

EDIT: I DONT KNOW NAMES!!

EDIT2: It is state law in Michigan to honor a price tag, and if you are overcharged you are given back the money and given a bonus.

apple,Got my iPhone 4 Lens Scratched and Fixed,"I just wanted to share my good story if anyone is going through something similar. 

I have an iPhone 4 and I have a case on it most of the time but sometimes I would throw it in my bag or purse (with or without the case) and over the span of two years the lens on the back of the camera had gotten completely scratched. All of the photos I took came out looking like the rooms were foggy or I'd used some sort of soft focus filter. 

I took it to the Apple Store and explained what was going on and they said it was really common and that they could replace the back of my phone for $29. I was going to get an entirely new iPhone because I use my phone as my camera more often than my camera, and it would have been worth it to get a new phone just for that. 

When they initially took my phone they were really courteous ""Can I see it?"" ""I'm going to go into your preferences now..."" And explained everything they were doing. It took ten minutes for them to put the new back on. I waited outside the store on a bench (inside a mall) and more than one Apple Employee came out to talk to me to see if I would be eligible for a discount or to tell me how much longer it would be.

When he was done the guy even let me peel off the plastic from the back since he said people like doing that. 

So yeah, if you have an iPhone 4 and the lens is scratched, take it to an Apple Store. It made my phone feel brand new, and for $29 thats not too bad.",51,108,2012-12-29,AAPL,0.04359585419297218,0.9017053246498108,0.05469878017902374

apple,"Another fake ""Lock My Screen"" app climbing up the paid apps list. Why does Apple allow these obvious scams to succeed?","It's been years and still every other week one of these apps that claim to be able to modify iOS lock-screen into an Android style one show up. The first three dozen reviews are always paid for 5 star ones. The description does not say that the app is just a wallpaper, not even in the ""fine print"".

The apps climb the ranks of the app store and that's when hundred of angry 1-star reviews start showing up. The deed is done though, by now the developer has made thousands of dollars off of unsuspecting users.

I personally will never fall for something like this, no matter what the glaring initial reviews because as a technical person I do understand developers are limited to Apple provided iOS APIs and there is no such API for modifying lock-screen (unless you jailbreak, but that's a different story). However, in no way or shape I expect the average user to even remotely understand such concepts. 

Why does Apple ignore this recurring problem and how can these apps not only get through the rigorous approval process but also remain on top of the App store for weeks?!
