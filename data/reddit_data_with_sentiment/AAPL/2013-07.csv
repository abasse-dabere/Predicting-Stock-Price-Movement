mac,I'm hoping you guys can help.,"So my mother has a macbook pro and the other day she plugged it in and turned it on after it had been totally drained of battery. The charge indicator light was green and then went orange for a little bit but then the whole thing completely shut off.

She asked me to take a look at it and I found a staple in the charging port. I'm sure this has something to do with the problem but what I'm wondering is how? What would that do to make the laptop not work at all.

When I plug it in now the green light comes on but stays green and it doesn't turn on.

mac,Samsung 840 Pro vs Crucial M500 SSD Late 2011 Macbook Pro,"I have been looking to upgrade my MBP for some time, and it seems that SSD's have finally gotten to the price point where it seems feasible. I was going to order 16 gigs of RAM from Crucial due to it's cost, but I've been torn between the 2 SSDs aforementioned above. It seems the 840 pro has better speeds, but I've also heard Crucial has better customer service and reliability. I was just wondering if anyone here as one of these SSDs and can point me in the direction of the better one.

Also, is it worth going up to the 512 GB version if I already have a 1TB external HDD? For background, my year old MBP had around 60GB used (120 GB was used before I cleaned it up), most of which was music. I'm also starting college in the fall and I want this computer to last me all 4 years. I don't play PC games nor do I download HD movies. This will mainly be a computer dedicated to schoolwork/netflix. Should I drop the extra money for a 512, or should I stick with the 256GB?

Since I'm here and I don't want to make another post. Is their a difference on what RAM you get? For example, is Corsair Vengeance RAM better than Crucials if they are both at the same size?

My question is would i be able to partition the external drive, and format both of the partitions separately. So for example a 400GB partition formatted as FAT32 to store work files on which i could also use on the universities computers, and a 100GB HFS+ partition for storing my VMs.

I have recently developed a mobile design environment called Nonwoven, which in time became one of my personal favourite. http://csc.im/nonwoven

Things that would make use of the features of the application such as blending modes, mirrored and radial symmetrically cloned brushes, painting over generated patterns etc. They all make sense when you take a look at the documentation above :).

If you are interested, please send me a message through the app's facebook page http://facebook.com/nonwovenapp so that I can send you a promocode for it. Then, when I publish the application I will feature these images in screenshots section along with the artist name on it.

Did you know you can access menu items in a similar fashion using OSX's menu search?  Press **CMD-?**, to do a menu item search.  However, **CMD-?** menu search DOES NOT focus on the top-most-relevant item, which forces users to have to **arrow down** before pressing **enter** every time.  If Apple changed this to focus on the top-most-relevant item (like spotlight search), I think this would make the **CMD-?** menu search much more useful and make workflows more efficient for keyboard geeks like me.

ios,I'm an indie game developer and I need your help,"Hey reddit!

My name is Dani and I'm an indie game developer and computer science student.

For the past 6 months I have been working on a mobile puzzle game called Roll With It! I was hoping for the game to make a bit of revenue for me to be able to afford my next year's tuition.

After a lot of work in order to make the most out of the game, it was released last week. Unfortunately it didn't got much attention and thus didn't match up to my expectations.

I'm afraid that if it keeps not selling I will have to suspend my academic education and find a job since I won't be able to sustain it. And this is where I need your help - spread the word about my game! Try out the demo, buy it if you like, and most importantly, tell the world about it.

I love being a game developer and I believe this can be a great jump start into the gaming industry. If you support indie games, and you want to see more of them coming, it should be in your interests to support indie developers.

I already have big plans for my next game and I'm sure all of you will love it, but to make it real, I just can't fail right now.

Please help me make this game a success... It doesn't have to be a big one. Just enough to keep me going.

mac,My MacBook Pro crashes and runs very slow,"I've been a mac user for quite a while and my computer has been wonderful.  Recently I noticed that it's been very slow to start up and launch apps.  More recently, I tried installing Spotify, and after between 8-14 seconds of a song, I get the spinning wheel.  Then the other day, I tried uTorrent, and after a few MB of downloads, I get the spinning wheel.

I have 8GB RAM, i7 processor, and this happens whether I'm running a bunch of apps at one time, or after a fresh restart.

I've run activity monitor to see if anything looks like it's hogging a bunch of resources, and nothing looks strange to me.  I've repaired the disk permissions, and the SMART status is good.

I've cleared my desktop down to just a few small shortcuts, no big files there.

Photoshop used to launch in maybe 2-3 seconds and now it takes at least a minute.  Chrome is the same.  Even launching Preferences takes about 45 seconds where it used to be instant.

apple,"Why does Apple get so much hate? (Maybe this has been asked before, but this could be educational for those who havent seen it)","I first started using computers, PCs, when I was in Pre-K in 1995 (X-Wing Space Flight Sim on DOS, man!). I didn't even TOUCH or hardly know Apple computers existed until my dad bought his 30GB iPod Video when it came out in 2005 (we still use the CRAP out of it to this day, and slightly shorter battery life aside, it still works like a charm). After that I started realizing there was a whole new world of computers out there! From then on I did constant research on Apple and always wanted one. I didn't get my first real bite of it until my aunt gave me her 2nd Gen iMac (slot-loading CRT) with OSX Leapord around 2007 or 08. It was great for some stuff, but I craved the new and sleek machines. We finally got a real up-to-date machine with the Unibody i5 iMac in 2010. We had used PCs up to that point, and we were tired with them. Long story short, from then on we have purchased nothing but Apple products (MacBooks, iPhones, iPads). 

All that to say I have no idea why Apple gets so much hate from the outside communities. Why do computer users have such opinionated people, to the point of ""Mac vs PC wars?"" I have foolishly been part of them for a long time, but recently I realized ""why am I doing this? Who cares what computer people want to buy? If they want a PC let them buy a PC!""

mac,Help transferring from an old mac to a new mac in target mode,"This has not been the best couple of days I've ever had.

I'm trying to transfer files from a much older machine to a brand spanking new one. The old one won't start up all the way (gets to the gray screen and then immediately shuts off), so I can't go in to do anything there. I've tried using Migration Assistant, selecting ""from another disc"" and then booting the old one in target mode (connecting them with a firewire cable), but the old one's HD never shows up.

Some background on the old one: I was running OSX 10.5.8 on a machine that was a good three or four years old. Thought I'd try upgrading to Snow Leopard, so I purchased the disc and tried to install.

Got an error saying ""this HD can't be changed"" and then a message telling me to restart. Now it won't boot.

No clue what I've done wrong, only that it must clearly have been some sort of catastrophic.

mac,"I have an idea in my head for adding a second HDD to my 15"" MBP. Will you help me decide if it sounds like a good plan or not, please?","tl;Dr version at bottom

I've been looking at buying an external 1TB HDD for a little while to use for time machine backups and external media storage. My router doesn't have a USB port so I can't network it as I had originally envisioned.

Being as MBP's are... portable, it doesn't sit in one spot very long so having to connect/disconnect the drive constantly would be a real pain. 

I was thinking add a second 750GB HDD (my factory one is a 750GB HDD) into the optical drive slot that way I have almost 1.5TB's of local storage. Keep one drive working like usual but use the second drive as an ""external"". Use it as my media storage/backup drive. 

The drive I have in mind is a 7200RPM WD Scorpio Black.  I figured use that as my main system/daily use drive and move the factory 5400RPM drive to the optical drives bay and use that (since it's slower) as the extra drive. 

Sound good? Early 2011 15"" MBP 2.2GHz 




*tl;dr* use two internal 750GB HDD's in my MacBook Pro, one for normal use and second as time machine backup/media storage?

I'm fairly certain some of these are legit because they seem to utilize the same method the provider did to unlock my iphone, that is;

1. Provide your IMEI and provider name
2. System checks for unlock availability
3. Provide you a code and connect to itunes for automatic factory unlock.

The thing is, there are so many websites selling these codes. Which ones are trustworthy? If you've used one in the past and are happy (or not) please say a word in the comments to help the rest of us find what we nee.

Guy acted interested for a few days. Kept being very inconsiderate of time and taking forever. Asked if I would take a check (flag there). Finally got scheduled to meet 5:30 tonight at a cafe.

After waiting another 20 min he finally shows up and I get out. He says we can just look in the car which I thought nothing of it. He's looking at it and asking questions which is normal but then he kept looking in mirror. This was making me nervous and I asked what was wrong. He said a car pulled up and he was just jumpy since he's carrying a lot of cash. I say we can move away and he says sure. We park up the street and he says would you take $1500? I said no. ""so if I put $1500 on the sear and walked out, you wouldn't take it?"" No. ""oh that's an iPhone. I want that too"" oh what plan do you have? ""Oh that doesnt matter"". I pretend to ignore that comment and ask if he wants it or not. I moved or something and he says he thought I was gonna swing at him so he pulls out a knife. I think at this point there's no way I'm getting out of here without A) being stabbed or B) robbed. I get panicked and try to calm him down but I'm frazzled. He says he has 4 brothers who will come take all my shit. It finally de escalates and I say do you want it or not? He asked what the rush was and I said I had to get home soon. He says we can pull up to his house and he'll grab the money (huh?) and invites me in (LOL). I decline and say ill park. He even walked from a different direction than this ""house"" was.

iphone,Iphone 4 stopped working suddenly 2 months after water damage,"It has been extremely hot and humid here the past few days.  Yesterday, my Iphone 4 started acting very strange (switching suddenly to the voice control screen, not sending texts properly, etc.).  I noticed there was a bit of condensation in the camera lens.  After a few hours of this, it shut off despite being fully charged.  When I plug it into my computer, it goes to the [apple start-up screen](http://i.imgur.com/PvoSdYS.jpg) and then turns black.  It does this the whole time it is plugged in.  When I plug it into the wall, it goes to a [gray-ish screen that says iOS 6](http://i.imgur.com/4VDvYFy.jpg).  When I slide the bar that says ""configure"", it takes me to [another screen that instructs me to connect to iTunes](http://i.imgur.com/TrOZgrI.png).

My phone got a little wet a few months ago, and I brought it to the Apple store to see if they could remove the battery for me so I could let it properly dry out.  They refused, so I just left it alone for a few days in a bag of rice and it worked fine after that.  Unfortunately, the moisture detectors were triggered and I also admitted that it had gotten a bit damp.  

I am wondering if my current problems are related to this earlier moisture damage.  If so, is there anything I can do?  I really cannot afford to purchase a new phone.",4.0,7,2013-07-15,AAPL,0.37932658195495605,0.5933233499526978,0.027350064367055893

iphone,Apple almost made me pay to replace an iPhone 5 but sometime during the checkout process they said it became covered and they weren't sure why.. any ideas?,"I have had every iPhone since the 3. Usually I get Apple Care but this time I didn't. I had no insurance or anything. 

I was having issues with charging my iPhone 5. It wouldn't stay charging and sometimes it would randomly flashing in and out of charge mode like 50 times for no reason at all. I took it to Apple today and they said that the lightning dock was damaged and missing pins. They mentioned that this was not covered in my 1 year warranty and since I didn't have Apple Care or insurance - a replacement would cost $229. 

I decided to see if AT&amp;T could do anything for me since I was a faithful customer.. I have been looking at the GS4 but that would have ended up costing me just under $500 since I wasn't due for an upgrade. I'm not ready for that just yet... so I went back to Apple, and did what I had to do which was purchase a $229 replacement iPhone 5. 

**This is what I am unsure of...**
During the check out process the Genius entered in my serial # and also scanned in the info for my new phone. Sometime after this he rounded about 4-5 other geniuses who all started swiping through the employee iPhones trying to figure something out. Finally I was told that, they weren't sure why- but the replacement phone was suddenly covered. I asked how/why and they said that they weren't sure, the phone shouldn't be covered but for some reason it was.... and they weren't going to ask any more questions just said I would be getting the phone for free.


Any ideas why? As mentioned, I had no Apple Care/insurance. I checked and the original phone under a 1 year warranty until mid October but apparently the damaged pin connectors aren't covered.",8.0,6,2013-07-15,AAPL,0.06692385673522949,0.8927755951881409,0.04030053690075874

Long story short, we have a one that is still in production (metal mfg) for CNC programming. The guy running it is an owner and won't give it up to go to the newer versions or a PC.

His CRT monitor is original ('97 ish?) and is failing. I have no idea where to begin to get a replacement. Google, amazon, Ebay.. nothing has helped. I did do some reading and came across several warnings about making sure the wiring of the cable is an exact match otherwise you risk damage to the video card inside.

I have tons of modern monitors available, both VGA and DVI input so it's just the video cable connections I need help with.


Adapters? Special Cable? Any source or specific names I can use to help narrow down my search?

Here are links to the pictures I've taken of the cable end from the monitor (it's hardwired to the back of the CRT) and then the female connection on the back of the G3.

I'm pretty gentle when handling them as well. Never unplug from the cord, always at the base. I never wrap them around phone.

apple,So I want to renovate my room into an office: Macbook Pro used as desktop?,"So I'm considering turning my bedroom into an office. I've used Apple Products for years now, at least ten of them. I will never go back to a PC. I'm a video editor, animator, and digital artist. Mac is perfect for me. I also game, but very lightly on my computer. The most I do is WoW. 

Now, I've used a Macbook Pro since I've owned my own Mac for the majority of my experience. The only other computer I've owned was an eMac. 

My question is, can I use my Macbook Pro (mid-2009) as a desktop computer? That is to say, hooking up a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to it? I already have a wireless mouse and it works fantastically. I'll probably get a wireless keyboard to match my mouse. My only concern is a monitor. I've used a DV to HDMI to get display my Macbook Pro on a TV but I don't do that often. 

Is there a display that matches the quality of the iMac's which I can also plug my Macbook Pro (mid 2009) into? 

Is there anything that can occur as a result of keeping my Macbook Pro plugged into a display? I would prefer not to have any sort of damage or anything from this. 

And does anyone have any offhand tips for this project? I'm starting from scratch essentially, as I don't have a desk, chair, or anything...maybe places to get that sort of stuff?",35.0,7,2013-07-20,AAPL,0.0441400408744812,0.9256661534309387,0.03019377589225769

I chose the Power Mac G5 case because it is **the** most aesthetically pleasing case available, in my opinion. Because of this, I wanted the internals to reflect that, by making everything as clean as possible - which is why I opted for a symmetrical, parallel loop to create the cleanest lines possible.

I own an iPhone 4S, and have been eyeballing the iPad mini.  I know Apple usually announces new items around this time, but I've heard there are MAJOR delays for the next gen of iPads.

Would anyone make a recommendation on what to do?  Is the iPad Mini awesome enough to warrant a purchase now, or wait and see?  I hate waiting and really am chomping at the bit to get one.

You can see the settings I have in pmset on how I turned off the hibernate mode. I also added huge amount of time to the autopoweroffdelay. In addition, I created a blank sleepimage file and sudo chflags uch on it, because OSX still kept recreating the file if I didn't do that.
 
What's causing this to wake up? Is it because did I do the hibernate thing wrong? In my energy saver preferences, powernap is not on for both battery/poweradapter. Wake for wi-fi network access is checked for poweradapter (default), but this all happened while I'm on battery.

apple,Will Apple stop charging $100 for storage upgrades on iOS devices?,"For several years, it has been an industry standard for companies to charge an extra $100 for doubling storage in their portable devices. However, it seems that recently, most companies are lowering the cost of storage upgrades as component costs decline.

In 2007, Apple charged $100 to upgrade the iPhone's storage from 4GB to 8GB. [This upgrade cost Apple $24](http://appleinsider.com/articles/07/07/03/apples_iphone_margins_estimated_in_excess_of_50_percent.html), or $6/GB. This comes out to be a 316% markup.

In 2011, [the cost to Apple for storage in iPhone 4S was $19.20, $38.40, and $76.80 for 16Gb, 32GB, and 64GB models respectively.](http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns/News/Pages/Many-iPhone-5-Components-Change-But-Most-Suppliers-Remain-the-Same-Teardown-Reveals.aspx) This comes out to $1.20/GB, which is five times less than it was four years earlier. The markup on flash storage from 16GB to 32GB at this time is 421%. The upgrade from 32GB to 64GB had a modest 160% markup

In 2012, the cost of flash storage was nearly half as what it was a year earlier (same source as the previous paragraph.) The cost of storage on iPhone 5 cost Apple $10.40, $20.80, and $41.60, or $0.65/GB. The markup from upgrading from 16GB to 32GB is now 862%. The markup from 32GB to 64GB is 381%. 

If Apple continues the trend this year, they'll likely be marking up the cost of flash storage in their devices well over 1500% for the 16GB to 32GB upgrade, and over a 700% markup for the 32GB to 64GB upgrade.

For the past year or so, Google has charged $50 for storage upgrades in their Nexus 4 and Nexus 7. The new Nexus 7 only costs $40 to upgrade from 16GB to 32GB. Many carriers are charging an extra $50 to upgrade the Galaxy S4 from 16GB to 32GB. 

Sure, it makes sense for Apple to keep its current pricing structure if it's more profitable. The average consumer wouldn't even think about component costs when considering storage upgrades. However, I almost feel like we're being cheated by paying for these upgrades. 

Everybody I know generally sticks with the lowest capacity, as they feel that $100 for twice the storage is too expensive. I feel like making the cost to upgrade cheaper would result in more people paying for storage upgrades. I have the 64GB iPhone 4S, which I happily paid the $200 for in 2011, but paying the same price two years later seems like a ripoff.

mac,"Considering getting a 2012 Macbook Air, will it be fast enough to last me a few years?","My only computer right now is a 27"" iMac (2011), and it's a fantastic computer. The problem is that lately due to my class schedule and work load I'm much more in need of portability.  I used to have an iPad which worked great at the time, but I need something more capable of multi-tasking and overall I'd really just much rather have a full computer.  

So I was planning on buying a used 2012 Macbook Air, because I can find them in good condition for under $700 which is right around my price point.  My question, though, is whether or not the 4GB of RAM will last me a while?  The versions with i7's and 8GB's of RAM are floating around the $1000 range which is out of my price point.  The 4GB limit is really the only thing holding me back.

ios,iOS devices disconnect from wifi when streaming video (Please help),"[FIXED]
Ever since I updated my devices to iOS 5, every time I try to stream video(or talk to Siri), they are 'kicked' from my wifi. Then when I goto reconnect it says ""Unable to join '[NetworkID]"", so I have to wait a few minutes for something to reset. When this happens all wireless devices also are disconnected. It does not affect my wired connections, so it doesn't cut-off my internet completely. I have tried this out elsewhere and I can stream fine, so it is only my internet that trips them up. I have looked this up and it could be something to do with the encryption I use but i'm not that experienced with networking so I didn't really understand it.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated(even if you can tell me where to go would be great!)

iphone,An interesting story about Siri.,"One night around 2am, a few friends and I were standing around our fire station (we are EMTs) bored out of our minds, and waiting for a call. One of my friends wanted to play around with Siri, since he owns an android, and does not know of her greatness. He said some generally dumb things, but one got a reaction from Siri that we didn't expect. He said ""Help, I've been shot."" So Siri responded with ""Calling *name of fire station's dispatch center that we were standing outside of*"" We hung up quickly so that we didn't piss off our dispatchers with a prank call. This was when my iPhone was jailbroken and I was on 5.1.1, so I'm not sure if it would still get the same response, but it was very odd.

- delete anything

- rename anything

- move folders (but not individual jpegs, mp3s etc) to another location
