apple,Watched my 7+ get run over about 10x yesterday.,"I installed an iPhone holder on my bike and was using it for the first time yesterday. Apparently it wasn't as secure as I thought, especially with a leather case on my phone. 

So, of course as I'm riding down a busy street in Los Angeles, it gets bumped out of the cradle and falls to the ground in the middle of rush hour. 

I hit the brakes, pulled over and walked back. The light had turned green and there were a bunch of cars coming. The only thing I could do was sit and watch as it was run over. A bunch of times. 

When the coast was clear, I went to inspect it, expecting to have a cracked screen. Amazingly, no damage. The Apple leather case protected it pretty well (the case was pretty beat up though) and my screen protector also helped out. 

Later I noticed that the camera glass was cracked ‚Äî so it didn't make it through totally unscathed. But I'm still pretty stoked how well everything performed.

apple,As a Windows die-hard since I was 10 the last 24 hours has been a revelation for me.,"So this is gonna start as many of these posts likely do, as someone who constantly belittled Macs for their puny specs and inability to perform ""actual"" computer like things (Unfounded mind you I was just one of those lolololo PC Master race nub people) and constantly talked them down due to price and whatnot.

Well now as an older professional, my large at home Windows gaming rig is no longer suitable for things I actually have to do on a computer. 

While I saw gaming as the primary function of the computers I built over the year, now that I'm older I just don't have the time to play games like I used to. (I get my gaming fix on my phone or the occasional PS4 game)

Now in my new job I'm going to have to start traveling and doing office work on the go and so I took the plunge and bought a new 2016 MacBook and holy crap guys, I feel like a dick for all the shit talking I ever did about Macs.

The synchronicity between the OS and all the apps and my phone and whatnot is *incredible* I have never felt so ""as one"" with my computer before.

apple,[OC] [Analysis] Guessing the GPU in the next iMac.,"I often see a lot of people wanting better graphics in the iMac, and I think you're all about to get your wish. I've been predicting the GPU's apple will use in their MacBook Pro and iMacs for a while (because I'm obsessed with apple, and yearn for better GPU's). First, a little history: 

Apple uses Mid range *mobile* GPU's in their MacBook pros with up to a 50W or less TDP. This let me predict the use of the AMD 6750m, the 650m and 750m graphics from Nvidia. The M370X was a bit of a custom part, so I missed that. But all these GPU's basically max out the temps on the MacBook Pro and begin to throttle after 20 minutes, leading me to believe that 50W is the *max* TDP the MacBook Pro can handle. 

Apple uses Mid-high range *mobile* GPU's in their iMac with a TDP of 125W or less, and previously they sold the M295X and then the Nvidia 680MX and Nvidia 780M, and then the Radeon M290X. Currently apple sells the R9 M395X in the iMac (125W TDP). *all these cards* have a 125W or less TDP, with the iMac hitting ""peak"" temps when you run these cards full bore, leading me to believe that this is the ""max"" limit of what they can put in the iMac. 

-------------

Then, things got interesting. When apple unveiled the MacBook Pro a few months ago, something very interesting happened: **They used a full size Polaris 11 Card.** The switch to 14nm FinFET graphics cards meant a huge spike in efficiency. And that spike in efficiency meant that *both* AMD and Nvidia began to ship a chipset that could be used in desktop AND laptop graphics. 

What's really nice, is that the 14nm die shrink FINALLY meant that **AMD is no longer making ""mobile"" or ""desktop"" graphics. These are actually the same part, just binned and clocked differently.** AMD makes 2 GPU's: Polaris 10 (bigger) and Polaris 11 (smaller) The desktop 460 and the Radeon Pro 460 in the MacBook Pro are actually the *same* Polaris 11 chip! So apple brought desktop 460 graphics to the MacBook Pro. It's clocked down (for lower TDP) and binned higher with **all** cores enabled.

For reference of how ""good"" the down clocking is at lowering TDP, take a look at Polaris 11 chips used in the MacBook Pro vs Desktops. This was *extremely* good for the MacBook Pro, because for the first time, it doesn't throttle when running full bore, since the TDP is only 35W.

| GPU | TDP | Architecture| # of Cores | Clock Speed|
|------|------|---------|----|------|
| Desktop RX 460 | 75W TDP | Polaris 11 | 896 cores | 1200Mhz|
| Radeon Pro 460 (In MBP) | 35W TDP | Polaris 11 | 1024 cores | 900 Mhz|
| Desktop Radeon Pro WX 4100 | 50W TDP | Polaris 11 | 1024 cores | 1200Mhz |

Now, the MacBook Pro is *already* using a full sized Polaris 11 Chip, and there's nowhere to go, but move up to Polaris 10 for a bigger device. So, logically, Apple needs a Polaris 10

I can easily see apple down-clocking the **desktop** 470 and 480 (Polaris 10) to use in the iMac, because they can be down clocked and use FAR less power (Polaris is most efficient at 900Mhz). These would be fantastic for the iMac, since they are actually capable of decent performance at 4K. The next iMac model should sell a mobile variant of the RX 470 or RX 480, down clocked to meet the 125W TDP.

Take a look at the table I made below. The best case scenario is that we get a ""Radeon Pro 480"" treatment on the iMac, where it's a down clocked (for efficiency to 900Mhz) Full size Polaris 10 with 2304 cores, and having below the 125W TPD. Clock for clock, it should scale just like Polaris 11 did, since the architecture is the same.

| GPU | TDP | Architecture| # of Cores | Clock Speed|
|------|------|---------|----|------|
| Desktop RX 470| 120W TDP | Polaris 10 | 2048 cores | 1204 Mhz |
| Desktop RX 480| 140W TDP | Polaris 10 | 2304 cores | 1266 Mhz |
| Radeon Pro WX7100 | 130W TDP | Polaris 10 | 2304 cores | 1243 Mhz|
| ""Guessed"" iMac GPU** | 91W TDP | Polaris 10 | 2304 cores | 900 Mhz |

** Guessed specs for the Radeon Pro 480 (if AMD calls it that), Polaris 10 card that will most likely show up in the next iMac.

IF my calculations are correct, the 91W TDP in the iMac's graphics will be a huge boon to ~~gamers~~ everyone, since the GPU's will not overheat, and will perform far better than the current R9 M395X (125W TDP) does under windows and macOS. Shaving 34W off the TDP means that iMacs will run cooler, quieter, and have less stress on the GPU. It should also perform FAR better due to the new architecture.

It's also entirely possible that Apple will bring Radeon Vega graphics to the Mac Pro (IF it gets updated) with the Radeon Pro WX 8100 and WX 9100 (Currently not released)

----------------

**Tl;Dr:** based on the trends and data available (and summarized above), Apple will likely use a full sized Polaris 10 GPU, clocked down to 900Mhz, in the iMac, which will be a HUGE boon to the 5K display, and to temperatures inside your iMac.

apple,I was sold a stolen Apple Pencil by CEX (WeBuy) - Please avoid CEX for Apple Products.,"Basically, I bought an Apple Pencil from CEX (WeBuy) the other day. When I went home, I went to check if it had warranty time left from the past user with the serial number. Surprisingly, it told me ""there is no purchase date associated to this serial number"".

I speak to customer service, and the senior adviser of Apple tells me this Apple Pen was stolen and should be returned to Apple. Thankfully, CEX put the serial number of the pen on the receipt, so I could prove to Apple I was innocent, and Apple was extremely nice to recognise this and support me.

Apple recommends me to return it to an Apple Store, while CEX asks me to return the item (now registered under my name on my Apple account) to them, and offer a voucher to re-buy items there. What if CEX does not return it to Apple and gets me in legal trouble? What should I do?

So my two options are: 

1. Return to Apple and get NO money back (lose all my money I spent on the Pencil). 

2. Return to CEX and get a voucher, but wonder what CEX will do with it, as Apple has requested me to hand the pencil to an Apple Store. 


Anyway, thanks to Apple for supporting me and believing me over this, and this is a reminder for you guys to never buy Apple stuff at CEX.

apple,iOS Photos App Needs A Photo Vault,"So before you say it, I recently learned you can hide photos by pressing the share button and then selecting ""hide"". This is a really neat feature that removes photos from the moments portion on the app and won't be seen scrolling through pictures on the camera app. Unfortunately the hidden photos will still show up under the ""All Photos"" album somehow making your photos hidden but not really.

I think the photos app needs a vault to store personal photos. This could be done by incorporating Touch ID to the ""Hidden"" album and making sure photos are hidden throughout the entire app. I think this would be a welcomed addition in the app as there are tons of 3rd parties on the App Store providing this exact feature but nothing would beat a built in private photo album.",36,133,2017-03-07,AAPL,0.03184524551033974,0.9290541410446167,0.03910057991743088
AppleWatch,Watchcast - a new podcast app designed for the Apple Watch,"Sorry for the self promotion, but I know podcast playback from the watch is a common topic (and complaint).  Hopefully this post will be mutually helpful!

I bought an Apple Watch in January and wasn't thrilled with the existing options to sync and listen to podcasts on the watch without my phone.  I run a lot and I really wanted to run without my phone, so I decided to build my own app.  

Apple just approved the first release, available here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watchcast-store-and-play-podcasts-on-your-watch/id1207662678?mt=8


**Current features**

- Copy podcasts to your Apple Watch and listen through its speaker or bluetooth headphones
- Podcasts play in the background while you track your workout with your favorite app
- Use the iOS app to subscribe to podcasts, download episodes and transfer to your watch
- Playback progress is synced between your phone and watch so you can seamlessly resume listening where you left off
- On a per-show basis, enable automatic downloading and transferring to your watch
- Current playback controls on the watch: play, pause, skip back 15 seconds, skip forward 30 seconds (the next update which should be out in a day or two will add volume control and high speed scrubbing)
- TIP: To speed up transfers, leave the app on the foreground on your watch

The app is free to download with all features enabled, but to subscribe to more than two shows requires a $2.99 in-app purchase.  Note that you can manually search for &amp; download as many shows as you want without making the purchase [edit: this is actually broken right now and you can only download podcasts for two different shows, I will be changing this to work as intended].

I'm the sole developer and a heavy user of the app, so it will be improved over time.


**Planned features**

- (Soon) background refreshing, updating your subscriptions in the background by checking for new episodes and downloading/transferring to your watch
- (Future) playback speed controls, allow a per-show playback speed setting (e.g. 1.5x)

apple,"Four days with the 15"" Macbook Pro touch bar so far...","I took the plunge and got the 15"" Macbook Pro.  For some background I've used Macs for work and personal computing for over 10 years now.  I've had a PowerMac G5, Macbook Pro(s), Macbook Air, iMac, MacMini (for my home theater), and my ex-wife had the old white Macbook - I've used a few Macs in my day...  

So without rehashing what a million reviews already say.  I have to say, I use my computers for actual work.  I mean, I'm a professional programmer and I'm an avid amateur photographer and use Lightroom / Photoshop / Premiere fairly regularly.  

I have no problems with the performance of this machine.  The processor is more than enough, the SSD is shit-your-pants quick.  But I will address the two complaints I've heard from just about every review and post on the new MBP:

**Touch bar:**  I don't hate it, I don't even dislike it, my feelings toward it are pretty neutral.  I could see myself actually liking it as it becomes more useful if more applications start to support it.  I do like how you can shuffle around the buttons and remove the ones you don't use.   

I read a bunch of complaints about the escape key, but as it turns out, I NEVER use the escape key.  Like never ever.  I didn't even realize that until I started watching myself to see if that was going to be an issue, it's not.  My only complaint was that I kept hitting the Siri button when using the delete key, but after it happened a couple of times I opened up system preferences and removed it from the touch bar and haven't had a problem since.  

**Having only USB-C ports:** I was iffy on this aspect.  I purchased a USB-C hub with HDMI, USB-C, USB-A, and an SD card reader ahead of time.   I have a nice 4K monitor for desktop use with audio out and USB built in, and after a few days of going back and forth between desktop usage and portable usage, I get it, I know why Apple ditched all ports except USB-C...   USB-C is a godsend!  

I've used an iMac for desktop usage the last 4 years.  But, the last time I used a laptop as a desktop (2012 or so), I would have to plug in the DVI, the USB to my desktop hub, the audio for my desktop speakers, the magsafe port for charging...  With USB-C, I can leave everything plugged into one point, the hub, including the charger.

apple,Impressed with iPhone 7's water resistance-it went for an ocean swim,"A few days ago, I was climbing around my favorite local beach. I managed to lose my brand new iPhone 7 somewhere along my trek and figured it was a goner for sure. I've never lost or broken a phone in 15 years of owning one so of course I didn't have insurance on it. $500 later (what I owed sprint for the phone) I have a new iPhone 7 plus. 

Fast forward to today. A woman actually found my phone yesterday and located me on Instagram!! I met her and picked up my phone. Keep in mind it had a cheap $5 case on it and only a glass screen protector. 

I made sure it was entirely dry and plugged it in to charge. I'll be damned if that thing doesn't still turn on, function, hold a charge and play music perfectly. The screen has a small crack and the home button doesn't work (thankfully a touch screen button appears on the screen in case of this situation). 

I'm so incredibly impressed with Apple and the iPhone 7's. I was sure that my phone was going to be gone forever because it was undoubtedly in the surf for at least three hours and even if it was found, there was no way it was going to work. 

So far, it's working great and now I've got two new iPhones. Here's hoping it continues to work!  https://imgur.com/gallery/Q2TIx",106,288,2017-03-12,AAPL,0.021050499752163887,0.8825815320014954,0.09636801481246948

apple,Why hasn't apple addressed ads that force open App Store?,It's a extremely frustrating when visiting certain websites and randomly an ad pops up asking to open up App Store.

Seriously annoying when trying to actually get work done or just enjoy a site. Surely there's something Apple can do to put a stop to this.

iphone,As an Android user I am very impressed with iOS. I spent the last 3 weeks with an iPhone 5.,"I had never used an iPhone before.  My only experience with iOS was back in 2011 when I had an iPod Touch for a while.  About 3 weeks ago my Moto X Pure took a fall and unfortunately met it's demise.  I needed something cheap and had to find a replacement that day.  I stumbled upon a 16gb iPhone 5 that had a new screen but the body was a little dinged/scuffed.  I couldn't pass it up for $50.  I wasn't expected a whole lot but I knew it would get me by for the time being.


I am impressed!  I cannot believe how well it runs the latest update of iOS 10.  Everything is relatively smooth and lag free.  It even runs Pokemon GO just as well as my MXP did!  And this is from a phone that came out at the end of 2012!  Hell, the camera is still pretty good considering it's age.  Needless to say unless I find a screaming deal on a brand new Android flagship I am probably going to upgrade to a 6s.

apple,What I think the 2017 iPad means for this September's iPhone devices,"Yesterday Apple introduced some new products. It's fair to say that reception to these products was underwhelming but my mantra is don't expect anything and you won't be disappointed. I mean heck we would have all been more upset if the Store came back online with no new products.

The most interesting new product is the new 9.7"" ""iPad"". 
Not iPad Air 3, just iPad.
This naming strategy is a return to simplicity in the 9.7"" devices which have seen some interesting choices for official names;

- iPad
 
- iPad 2

- The New iPad

- iPad with Retina Display

- iPad Air

- iPad Air 2

Now we return to ""iPad"" which I believe indicates Apple's future plans for naming conventions.

Cast your mind back to 1997 and remember the ""Product Matrix"" strategy.
It looked something like this;

 |Consumer|Professional
:--|:--|:--
Desktop|iMac|Power Mac
Laptop|iBook|PowerBook

Apple's product line has grown since then and their naming conventions have changed too, but I argue that you can still fit the Desktop Mac, Portable Macs, and their Tablets into this grid.

 |Consumer|Professional
:--|:--|:--
Desktop|iMac|Mac Pro
Laptop|MacBook|MacBook Pro
Tablet|iPad|iPad Pro

You could even add a third column for Mac mini and iPad mini. However, I doubt that Apple will introduce a ""mini"" laptop. 
Also, I appreciate the the MacBook Air doesn't fit into this but I suspect that it's not long for this world.

So wouldn't it make sense for the iPhone to follow suit?
What we would know as iPhone 7S becomes a spec bump in the exact same body but they drop the suffix and call it iPhone.
The rumoured device with a larger screen and less bezel in a smaller sized body becomes the iPhone Pro.
Again you could fit iPhone SE in the ""mini"" column if they rebranded it to iPhone mini.

So I suspect that Apple's full product line in September 2017 will look like this;

 |Consumer|Professional
:--|:--|:--
Desktop|iMac|Mac Pro
Laptop|MacBook|MacBook Pro
Tablet|iPad|iPad Pro
Phone|iPhone|iPhone Pro

tl;dr
Following Apple's current naming conventions it makes sense for the iPhone 7S to be just called iPhone and the rumoured new iPhone to be called iPhone Pro.",320,786,2017-03-22,AAPL,0.0256754569709301,0.9299517869949341,0.04437267780303955

&gt; It was lawyers, not strategy.

&gt; A few weeks ago, Workflow asked all supported apps to sign a simple 1-page contract confirming permission to call our URL schemes.

&gt; People sue Apple over ANYTHING, ALL THE TIME, so it makes sense for their lawyers to be overly cautious like this in an acquisition

&gt; I was a bit put off by the need to review and enter into a legal contract for continued Overcast support in Workflow, but I signed it.

&gt; Google‚Äôs lawyers probably ignored such a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù request or decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle or legal risks, so they didn‚Äôt sign.

&gt; And that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt have nice things: not Apple being a jerk, but two sets of lawyers being overly cautious, which is their job.

iphone,Literally zero lag,"I bought my first iPhone a couple months ago, 256gb iPhone 7 plus, mostly with the intention of using it and my Nexus 6p, changing from one to the other every couple days (I'm a phone geek, I know). I was an android user since 2008 and used to always hate on iPhone. That being said, I find it harder and harder to use my 6p, and barely touch it recently. I cannot unsee the stutters now, the UI always has little micro lag. The iPhone, on the other hand, never lags, no matter what I throw at it. I feel like android phones keep throwing more power at the problem, but it is never truly fixed.

apple,I really wish you could change default apps on iOS,"I'm praying for this feature in iOS11.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a huge fan of Android. I used a Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge for half of last year and, although the hardware was actually great, I still find Android to be clunky and frustrating at times. You cannot beat the usability and friendliness of iOS in my opinion.

That being said - I love the ability to choose which apps I want as defaults. I mean it makes sense. You can do that on any computer, including Macs, why not on my iPhone?

I don't mean for messaging and similar apps - I never would have my SMS chats in the same application as Facebook messenger, which is surprisingly a feature on android...

But for apps such as Calendar... Google's iOS app is way better in my opinion. I'd love to have that set in a way that Siri would work (when it actually works) by adding new events to that application rather than Apple Calendar.

Or Weather... I'm from the UK and so BBC Weather or the Met Office will be my only choice for looking up the weather - why am I stuck with Apple's app using Weather.com? What even IS Weather.com?

I have high hopes. Now that they've allowed us to 'hide' default applications, I'm really hoping this time next year I can ask Siri to play a song, and it opening up Spotify instead of Music. One can hope.

Rant over.
