mac,Question about VNC-ing into a Mac running OS X 10.9.4,"Hi all, hoping some of you have some experience with this.  I'm using the out-of-the-box VNC setup on OS X, and it works quite well.

My issue is that when I VNC in I have to type my password on 2 separate screens before I get access to the desktop.  This isn't SO bad, except for the fact that I'm usually accessing the computer from a mobile device.

I don't really care much about security, and I generally only VNC locally, so my firewall can do the job of keeping out outside traffic.

Does anyone know how to make it so I don't have to type any password when VNCing in?  I have this functionality on my Windows 7 machine but that is because (presumably) the authentication is handled by my client app.",4.0,9,2014-10-01,AAPL,0.03453501686453819,0.9300636053085327,0.03540137782692909

iphone,AT&amp;T Shipping Time Thread.,"Alright everyone, I've noticed everyone is frantic with there shipping times... Some people getting there new iPhones before others. Please reply with when you preordered/ordered and if you received.

Edit: So far it seems they're working on the 9/12 orders for iPhone 6+. Nothing confirmed after.

iPhone 6 seems to be moving out faster. Will keep this up to date.

Edit 2: Confirmed that not all people who preordered iPhone 6+  on 9/12 have received a phone and some still waiting tracking number. 

iPhone 6's seem to be going out in some cases next day it looks like.

Edit 3: Ship dates on later phones are all over the place. Someone that ordered (iPhone 6+ SG 64gb) on say the 27th could be 11/9 - 11/27 yet someone who ordered the 28 could be 11/4 - 11/14. Another thing to note is when ATT ships your order is when your 14 day policy return starts.

iphone,Bent iPhone 6 - Not Easy To Replace,"My iPhone 6 was bent - http://imgur.com/bq7RzVQ

I'm fairly certain it happened during my drive to work during which i store my phone in my fairly loose jeans pocket, camera towards the floor and screen towards my leg. I was using my phone before i went to work and did not notice it being bent and am sure i would have done, put the phone on my desk and straight away noticed the bend.

I booked myself a Genius appointment and this is what happened:

Genius came over asked what the problem was, i explained that i put my phone down this morning and noticed a bend. He looked at the phone for about 10 seconds and then said he was going to speak to his colleague. 5 minutes later he came back, slapped the phone on the table and said ""it should be straight now"". Bewildered at his response i asked him what he had done and he said he just bent it back into place, after he had bent it back (a task which i could have done myself) there were kinks on either side of the iphone casing where it had bent one way and then back the other. Told the guy i wanted to speak to his manager because i wanted the phone replaced. 

Manager came over and was just as reluctant to replace the phone as the first guy, we went back and forward for about 5 minutes arguing the point. He had offered a paid replacement which i think was around £200, he had also said i could try sending it back to the online store for a refund, which especially after being bent back would not have worked. One thing that also made me laugh is he advised me that i should not be carrying a ""mini computer"" around in my pocket. After not coming to an agreement because i did not want to pay, i said to the manager i would not be leaving the store until my phone was replaced free of charge because i don't expect a £619 device to bent in my pocket with minimal pressure. 

Now for the part that got me the replacement - i also said to the manager that i would like to speak to his manager to raise a formal complaint regarding the employee who bent my iphone back the other way without my permission.

He left, came back 5 minutes later and said he could make an exception this time and replace the phone free of charge. He also apologized for his colleague for bending my phone back. 

I think if the guy had not bent my phone back to its original shape i would still be stuck with the bent one. Don't just expect them to replace your phone easily. I'm now paranoid about storing my phone in my pocket which is absolutely crazy and am contemplating selling the replacement.

mac,Cannot repair disk on Snow Leopard. Totally baffled.,"Hi everyone ! 

First time poster here. Trying to run the verify disk to repair disk on Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and it keeps requesting for the install disc. I googled around a bit and found out I can run disk utility off the install disc if insert the disc and press c on boot. The apple logo appears and a thingy keeps spinning indefinately on the screen. What should I do ?

The thing I am trying to do is repair the disk and then upgrade to Mavericks as it is free at the moment. I am an utter first timer with Macs and I am trying to help my girlfriend. I am an adept WIN but everything mac is hieroglyphics to me.

mac,"Clear your app cache of old, unused apps and free up disk space on your Mac!","This came up in another thread, so I decided to make a little tutorial...

When you back up your idevice to iTunes, iTunes makes a copy of the apps you have installed on your idevices. These apps get stored in your ""~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications"" folder. When you delete an app from your idevice, iTunes does not delete it from the app cache.

You can freely delete the apps from iTunes without them being removed from the idevices. The next time you sync, it will back up the current apps from your idevice, but but the unused apps will remain deleted. In my case I had several gigs of old games that I deleted.

How to do this:

1. Update iTunes. This is ALWAYS step 1 when using iTunes.

2. Open iTunes.

3. Click the Library selector on the top left of the main iTunes window (most likely labeled ""Music"").

4. Select ""Apps"" from the available libraries.

5. Select individual unwanted apps or cmd+A (Mac)/ctrl+A (Windows) to select all apps.

6. Hit the delete key.

7. Click ""Delete Apps"" on the popup window.

8. Empty the trash.

Remember, your next sync will take a bit longer than normal as it copies apps over, but you will have a net gain in storage space. iTunes MAY even ask you if you'd like to stop backing up apps. It asked that for my iPad, but not my iPhone.",0.0,8,2014-10-06,AAPL,0.10337334871292114,0.8738428950309753,0.022783702239394188

ipad,"How do I delete old app data to free space shown as ""other"" on iTunes?","First of all I apologize if this question had been already asked/answered.

So here is my problem, 
I have a 4th generation 16GBs (Capacity 12.23GB) Wifi only  iPad updated to ios 8.0.2, I mostly use it for my studies so the files i have on it are limited on Notability.

When i go to Settings&gt;General&gt;Usage&gt;Manage Storage it will show all the installed apps and their memory usage: if I sum app all of the numbers listed, it results about 860 megabytes that equals the ""Apps"" and ""Documents and Data"" shown on Itunes.

The problem is that in Settings&gt;General it shows that i have used 2.2 GB and i have 10GB available. On iTunes it shows the 860 MB mentioned above plus 1.41 GB listed as ""Other"".

This morning i downloaded several apps to find a decent one to play some videos.. long story short I tried a lot of apps and then deleted them from Setting&gt;General&gt;Manage Storage.
There I noticed that when i delete an app its used space is not subtracted from the total hence my explanation for those 1.8 GB of ""other"".

Now the question(s), is it a bug on my device? or is it common on all other devices as well? And lastly how do i free up that ""Other"" space?",5.0,9,2014-10-07,AAPL,0.046854037791490555,0.9262421131134033,0.026903880760073662

apple,Let's discuss: AMD vs. nVidia GPU's in upcoming Macs,"With the new 980M and 970M release, I'm seeing speculation for the possibility of their inclusion in the new Retina iMac/MacBook Pros. I wanted to discuss this more here and get some of your input (and maybe temper some expectations). 

First of all, I would *absolutely love* to see updated nVidia GPU's in the new Mac Pro/iMac. And the GTX 980 and GTX 970 are **perfect** candidates to put in the Mac Pro. I'm going to focus on the Mac Pro, but by extension the iMac and MacBooks relate very closely. 

**Reasons nVidia 900 series may be likely**:

1. The biggest GPU limitation in the new Mac Pro is power. 450W of power is plenty for a single GPU setup, but for dual that's tight, so GPU's in the new Mac Pro must be very efficient. (As an aside, lower power also means lower thermal requirements — also critical for the tiny Mac Pro, and iMac)
2. Given 1), the GTX 970/980 are clearly *great* options for the Mac Pro. These new GPUs set the bar for performance-per-watt, and they're miles ahead of AMD in this regard. 
4. *""But, the GTX 980/970 aren't workstation cards! Apple wouldn't put non-workstation GPUs in the Mac Pro!""* — This objection doesn't hold water for me; Apple has *always* put consumer GPUs in the Mac Pros, up until the new Mac Pro. This is the first time we've ever seen workstation GPUs as the standard (and only) option. They've used consumer GPUs for decades, and I don't see why the 970/980 couldn't simply be a BTO option for the Mac Pro. 
3. AMD's Hawaii was a great performance improvement over Tahiti, but this improvement came with a massive power increase. [Given the rumors that AMD's next top-end card will require liquid cooling stock](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-radeon-390x-liquid-asetek,27665.html), it seems that they will be continuing their trend of ridiculously bad thermal performance. Apple values near-silent computers, and hot AMD GPU's would make that hard.
4. [The GTX 980 *significantly* outclasses AMD's R9 290X in OpenCL performance](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8526/nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-review/20), wheras typically AMD has the lead in this regard. 

**Reasons nVidia 900 series may be unlikely**:

1. Apple has a big investment in OpenCL. Lots of people love CUDA, and CUDA may be superior in many ways, but nevertheless, [Final Cut Pro requires OpenCL](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4664) for GPU acceleration, and AMD GPUs have generally supported OpenCL more. This aligns better with Apple's direction for GPU computing. nVidia has a vested interest in improving CUDA, and little interest in developing OpenCL.
2. Apple is clearly getting an insane deal on Tahiti chips in the new Mac Pro. The MSRP of a single W9000 (roughly equivalent to the D700) is $4,000, while you can purchase a Mac Pro with **two** of these cards for $4,000. Whatever kind of special deal they're getting with AMD is something they'd want to continue, and moving to all nVidia 900 series GPUs on their other product lines would likely hurt this relationship. 
3. Even though the nVidia 900 series is clearly more efficient, Apple could simply downclock new AMD GPUs to get them within thermal limits. They did this with the D300-D700 in the Mac Pro, and they could do it for the iMac. Even a downclocked top-end AMD mobile GPU could drive a 5K Retina iMac screen just fine, **if you ignore gaming**. And Apple doesn't make component choices based on how well they can play games. 


Personally, (unfortunately) I think that second list outweighs the first. As much as I desperately want nVidia GPUs in the Mac Pro and iMac, and as awesome as that would be for those that need OS X but enjoy gaming as well, I think that their current direction with AMD, OpenCL, and the Mac Pro are signs that, at least for the rest of 2014, we're not going to see new nVidia GPUs in any new Macs.",21.0,8,2014-10-07,AAPL,0.03711909847334027,0.886102557182312,0.07677830196917057

apple,"Some Lightning cables look real, feel real, but are totally fake. Be careful! Crude teardown inside.","So I bought a bunch of Lightning cables on eBay and the store swears that they are genuine OEM cables.  
They look like Apple cables, they feel like Apple cables, and they meet every single criteria on Apple's OEM verification guide except for the fact that they have 13 digits in their serial number instead of 12 or 17. Apparently this wasn't enough for the seller as they insist that the cables are genuine and are actually challenging me to go to the Apple Store and verify. I already booked my reservation but I'm a former Apple Store Genius so I hopefully already know what I'm doing.

Since I didn't have any of the proper tools at home to do a proper cable teardown, I just literally tore one of the cables down. As in, I just split the plastic boot in half and ripped everything out. I looked for the metal enclosure and it wasn't there. It was just a plastic sleeve and then a shoddy looking chip (DEFINITELY not Apple) inside. http://i.imgur.com/anN9tYJ.jpg | http://i.imgur.com/PFYS8xh.jpg  

I did a more controlled teardown of another cable with a 13-digit serial: http://m.imgur.com/a/TL5Jj  

So I'm more than completely convinced that these cables are fake as shit and advise everybody not to buy them. I'm heading to the Apple Store tonight to do some two-way tests with the cable and will report back. 

EDIT: The Geniuses at the Apple Store that I spoke to were completely inept. I pointed out the fact that the serial numbers are in a completely different format than actual OEM cables and they just shrugged. And told me to use them. I brought the sample OEM cable that I took apart and the ""OEM"" one that I destroyed and showed them that they are very clearly different chips and the metal housing is missing but they told me it's fine and that I should use them. I obviously won't be using them but it just goes to show that these can fool even some Apple Store Geniuses. I took them to another Apple Store and they agreed that the serial numbers should only be the number of digits that it says on the Apple support page.

mac,2007 iMac - is it worth it trying to speed this puppy up?,"Hi, 

Sorry if this is an inappropriate place for such a question. 

Picked up a 2007 24"" iMac for $75 from my agency to supplement my 13"" MBP. Mint condition, running Mavericks 10.9.5 (see screenshots below for more details.) 

I'd love for it to be a realistic alternative for getting work done, but at the moment,  CS6 runs at a *crawling* pace – not realistic enough to use as a work station. (Note: I'm not processing mega loads of video, but often work with RAW photos/big PSD's.) 

Other stuff in the background - Safari, Mail - seems to run reasonably quick while Photoshop is 'thinking'. 

[Here's the stats on the current set up.](http://imgur.com/a/uDWpU) 

Bang-for-buck, what's the best thing I do could do to get this puppy up to a reasonable operating speed? I've done a few HDD swaps on my MBP, and would be comfortable digging into the back of this thing to replace a CPU chip, add more RAM, add more HDD space, swap to a Flash drive – what I don't know is how much net effect that will really have, and what costs will be, so I can determine the value of doing so. I know switching to a flash drive on my MBP made a massive difference, but I'm not sure whether this older machine is limited by the processor, video card, HDD, RAM..  all of the above...

mac,OS X Yosemite USB Device Power Negotiation?,"Hi everyone!

I recently purchased a Buffalo external USB blu-ray burner drive.

It has 2 usb cables. One for data and power, and a second if additional power is needed. If you plug the one cable in and get a blue LED, you don't need the second cable and it's got enough power. If you get a red LED, you need the second cable for supplemental power.

I have a late 2013 retina macbook pro 15"".

I am running the latest Yosemite beta.

If I plug in the one USB cable, I get a red LED on the burner and the mouse cursor freezes for a few seconds on the mac.

If I then plug in the second USB cable, the LED goes blue and I can use the drive.

However, if I boot into Windows (8.1), and plug in the one USB cable, the LED flashes red and then goes blue, like the optical drive initially didn't get enough power with the standard 500ma, requested more, and then got it. Why doesn't this happen in OS X? The reviews of the drive on Amazon have people saying it works with one cable on OS X, although I assume they aren't running Yosemite.

Does anyone have any insight into this? I'll test on a mac with Mountain Lion ASAP.",2.0,9,2014-10-16,AAPL,0.02186325192451477,0.939987063407898,0.03814971446990967

ipad,Should I upgrade to the iPad mini 2,"I am already using an iPad mini 1. After apple said ""it's the cheapest iPad price point ever"" and all the little hiccups in iOS 7 I've been  thinking of upgrading. Does it really make sense. I've only had the iPad for a year. When I got it I wasn't involved in the world of apple and didn't know that a week after I bought it that they would release a brand new one. The only thing is that my family almost paid for it, I'm afraid they'll be offended if I buy a new one. (Which I'll pay for myself because I'll probably trade my first gen in). My parents are the kind of people that will use something until it falls apart and don't care if they can't get the latest software on something, I'm afraid they'll think its ridiculous. Is it really? I have also read that the a7 won't really improve web browsing that much though. And I thought I should mention I'm not just a ""watch Netflix and YouTube videos"" kind of person, this iPad really gets some heavy use. Also I've been starting to see how bad a non retina screen really is. When I went to the apple store I was amazed at the screen on the 2nd gen mini. And the home button reacted so much faster and everything just loaded almost instantly. The retina mini is faster on iOS 8 then mine is on iOS 7 :/ (plus going on the iTunes Store is a exhausting experience, so slow!) Also I regret getting the 16gb version. And the price of the 32 retina is only 349! 

So does it make sense to upgrade? And should I jump on the 32 retina mini for 349 while they still sell it?

EDIT: Went to an apple store yesterday. (It down poured and those glass doors aren't very secure so it was a little wet in the store) and I tried out the mini retina. iOS 8 really seemed bad, it was slow. I'm just not sure if it is their wifi or something, because apps that really weren't wifi necessary seemed good. But I really the performance seemed the same as what I have now. So that means I'm defiantly not updating to iOS 8 is the retina mini is slow. But actually my dad brought up the other day about how much the new one costs.

I have no idea what they are talking about, or why they were going into the messanger to type it. They then went back into Facebook and called up a photo full screen.

Again, I have the latest Apple Update and a Passcode assigned for access (just changed again). This iPad has never been Jailbroken, nor are there many apps on it and none loaded recently.

My question is... how is this possible and how do I get it to stop (block whoever it is)? 

I think they accessed it briefly yesterday... screens were acting funny, but saw no typing until today. It appeared they accessed it three different times throughout the day today though, mainly like they were opening screens about as fast as I could close them.

For me the only thing I could see the warranty paying off for something in the case of theft.but even then some plans I've looked at previously had a pretty high co-pay for that. So for a warranty replacement, you'd almost to end up paying twice at roughly twice the price of what you would pay for an OtterBox defender.

Anybody have any hopeful thoughts? anybody get either a warranty or a good case and end up wishing that they had both?",12.0,8,2014-10-19,AAPL,0.0387495681643486,0.9246658086776733,0.036584582179784775

apple,iPad Air 1 gets really hot and battery drains much faster after iOS 8.1 update bricked my device and did restore.

Upon taking it to the Apple Store to see what was the problem they wiped the iPad and I had to restore the iPad via backup.

However now the iPad gets quite hot on the right part of the device, to the point where the room itself feels hotter.  Even while browsing on a website it feels quite hot, it never cools down.

Also now the battery drains MUCH faster than before.  Now it takes less than an hour and twenty minutes to go to 80% and after about six or seven hours of casual use (browsing, reddit, etc) the battery is almost dead.  Before the battery would last about 14 hours of screen time with the same use.

I got the iPad Air a little less than a year ago, there should be no reason for this to occur no?

As you may or may not notice, there is an issue with Youtube Fullscreen on OS X Yosemite that leaves the bars unhidden whenever you fullscreen a video.

One quick - temporary - way to fix it is to put your pointer in the bottom left corner once in fullscreen, and they will go away. 
Whenever the bars disappear, you can move your mouse once again to get rid of the tiny little white pixel left by the mouse.

apple,In lieu of #boycottCVS let's go the full distance and #boycottMCX,"CVS isn't the only one blocking nfc payment methods, and it might now be the last. Let's get to the root of the problem

For those who don't know: MCX is making it's own mobile wallet called CurrenC, based on qr codes. Some of the retailers, such as CVS and Riteaid, have completely disabled all NFC payment methods, paving a path for their customers to only use CurrenC. the major catch was CurrenC is that it tracks all if your purchase history and your name and other stuff so companies can better advertise to you.",26.0,8,2014-10-26,AAPL,0.03148801997303963,0.9310030341148376,0.0375090166926384

apple,PSA: It's worth making a distinction between companies that accept CurrentC payments and those companies that have anti-competitively blocked ApplePay,"Much of the discussion I've seen regarding the CurrentC boycott has focused on retailers that accept CurrentC.  I think it's worth observing the distinction between retailers that merely accept CurrentC and those blocking ApplePay in an utterly tone-deaf display of anti-competitive arrogance.     

It's true that CurrentC is a shitty platform, offering virtually no benefits to consumers and giving every advantage to retail chains (see: pretty much every thread on the front page of [/r/apple](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple)), but it's worth noting that every player in the mobile, retail, and banking industries has been chasing mobile payments for years.  A sustainable mobile payment infrastructure has been their white whale, and until September 9, no obvious front runner existed.    

MCX was created years before anyone outside of 1 Infinite Loop ever heard the term ""ApplePay"".  Regardless of the motivation of its charter members and the values they represent, MCX offered other retailers a way to lend support to a potentially viable mobile payment infrastructure, as well as an opportunity to cash in on it.  It had legitimate appeal.    

It seems unfair and unrealistic to fault retailers simply for making the decision to support CurrentC [read: accept CurrentC payments] when no substantive alternative existed.  In addition to voicing our support for ApplePay and our disapproval of those parties that would thwart competition by rejecting it, we should also be supporting retailers that facilitate fair competition in the marketplace by accepting ApplePay, even and especially if they also accept payments through CurrentC.

**But all of that may be beside the point.**  According to [this article](http://www.fierceretail.com/retailit/story/mcx-sees-ach-as-its-interchange-salvation-many-chains-not-so-sure), MCX is demanding that retailers commit to a three-year exclusivity agreement - meaning CurrentC is the only form of mobile payment they can accept *following a one-year grace period*.  During the grace period, retailers can test drive CurrentC while still accepting other forms of mobile payment.  **If a retailer is accepting both CurrentC and ApplePay, it's a good bet they're still within this grace period, meaning they can still drop CurrentC if a competing platform proves successful enough to diminish its appeal.**  Voting with our ~~wallets~~ Passbooks will give these retailers all the hard data they need to kick CurrentC to the curb before they're locked into a long-term, anti-consumer arrangement with MCX.

**TL;DR: Restrict the boycott to retailers who are blocking ApplePay.  Reward the retailers that are giving it a chance alongside CurrentC - *and give them a reason to dump CurrentC* - by paying them with ApplePay.**",12.0,98,2014-10-27,AAPL,0.03979896754026413,0.9074865579605103,0.05271448567509651

I only want my macbook yosemite 10.10 to require a password to login when i actually physically close the lid, not when it just turns off display leaving afk for however long i set it to.

I still want display to sleep (i leave it on overnight some nights and i want everything to run active) and so i only want it to lock when i close the lid.

I have set to sleep 'never' and display sleep to '10 minutes'

mac,2014 Macbook Pro Retina kernel panics whenever Thunderbolt/ethernet adapter is plugged in.,"Whenever I plug the Thunderbolt/ethernet adapter in, my mac crashes due to a kernel panic.  This only happens when an ethernet cable is plugged into the adapter, not when the adapter is plugged in by itself.  If it makes any difference, I am on a school network connection. I tried plugging the cable in at home and it worked just fine.  I don't know if I was just lucky or if being on a home connection makes that much of a difference.  

I have tried clearing the PRAM and resetting the SMC, but nothing has worked.

Any suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated.

ios,iOS 8 and Exchange sync issue,"Here is a strange issue that i have been having since the release of iOS8. 

Environment:    Exchange 2010 Hybrid. 2 Mailbox severs on site, 2 CAS servers on site. Some users online. 
Domain:             Adomain.com, Emaildomain.com


Issue:               ever since updating to IOS8 (All 8.0, 8.0.1, 8.0.2, 8.1), IOS devices are randomly dong complete sync of exchange account. 

Support article http://support.apple.com/kb/ts4511 points to same issue but under earlier IOS.  All settings check out, no http error 500. 

Symptoms:    User will get email with unknown sender, no content but as soon as they go to inbox, email will start coming down as if email account was syncing for first time. 
User will get text message or call with no name. while reading message or going to contact will trigger sync and all contacts will start coming in as if account was syncing for first time. 

Another symptoms:     Users who have bcc to self setup, when sending email or replying to all will get NDR. 
			Why: Their exchange account's email address will change to username@Addomain.com from username@emaildomain.com. 
			NDR will say unknown user (username@Addomain.com not found). While looking through settings, under settings mail, contact and calendar, email address will be changed from username@Addomain.com from Username@emaildomain.com). 
			
Same problem even if we move the user to office365, reduce mailbox size, change device, setup device from scratch, without backup or reset phone partnership.
ActiveSync logs do not show any errors. 
			
I have contacted Microsoft and Apple. Both are puzzled about this issue. 

Microsoft is going through all logs and settings and have not found anything strange. Accepted domains, activesync heartbeat, timeouts, network timeouts, ssl, autodiscovery, testconnectivity.microsoft.com shows all green. 
Apple is saying it could be issue with Microsoft and need to speak to them. 

This would not be a big issue if all of the VIPs were not on new IOS and with iphone6 that doesn't support earlier ios.

mac,OSX - Which email provider do you use?,"So, I'm a long time Windows user and network admin.

Two days ago I bought a Mac as I wanted to see what all the fuss is about.

1) It's the single most beautiful piece of hardware I've ever touched. Apple make pretty things.
2) It is probably the most intuitive OS I've used. If I were recommending a computer to my Nan, I'd tell her to get a Mac. Everything just works.

I have one major gripe, and it's actually with Microsoft.

M$ Activesync (from what I can tell) is only permissible on mobile devices.
I use outlook.com as my main mail/contacts/calendar repository.
I can't sync contacts and calendars to my shiny new BigMac. That makes angels cry.

I don't want to swap to icloud as that's not compatible with Android (natively) if I ever decide to go back to a Droid phone.
I can't stay with outlook.com as it doesn't work with OSX.
I don't want a GMail account as they are essentially the devil.

It would seem my only choice is to rent a full exchange account which as far as I know will sync with everything. They are however more expensive than free. Which is a shame.

Any one know if I've missed anything obvious?

What do you use that's compatible with all platforms?
