apple,Monthly APPreciation Thread for September 2015,"Here's this month's App recommendation thread. What apps have you been enjoying for the past month?
*****
**Guidelines**  

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.  
* **One app per comment.**
* Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS and OS X are both game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a sentence or two, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc) because everyone knows about them.

*****
**Last month's top five suggestions:**  

1. [Hourglass](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hourglass-countdown-clock/id1004790367?ls=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;mt=8) ($0.99, iOS + Apple Watch) - Hourglass Is a minimalistic countdown clock. I launched Hourglass about a month ago. It lets you easily view countdowns until a certain event or date, for example ""Christmas."" It shows you the time in any way you'd like. What's great about Hourglass is that it has a beautiful, easy-to-use design. It also comes with a Notification Centre Today Widget and an Apple Watch App. -/u/clydethechicken

2. [Veracity](http://apple.co/1J2a8vi) (Free, iPhone) - It does reverse image search, which is useful since Google doesn't work on iOS (you can't choose a photo). I usually use it to find higher res photos, or sometimes if a profile photo looks too good to be true. -/u/mithrandirSC

3. [Noon Pacific](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noon-pacific-new-music-weekly/id803563983?mt=8) (Free, iOS) - New hand-crafted playlist released every Monday at 12PM pacific time. I don't like *all* the music that I hear, but what I really like about this service is the fact that it's free and that almost all the music is less than a month old. You're never going to hear something that's been played to death on the radio. -/u/GND52

4. [mySwapp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myswapp/id881977515?mt=8) (Free, iOS) - mySwapp is a social, digital bartering app that allows you to swap items that you never use (instead of throwing them out or selling them for 10% of the original price) with other users in your local area. It's free to download and free to use with the goal of eliminating waste :) -/u/shreyashirday

5. [Compost For Instapaper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/compost-for-instapaper/id1020927305?mt=8) (Free, iOS) - Sort through your instapaper bookmarks using a Tinder-like interface. (disclaimer, this is my first app, check it out!) -/u/Azerah

**Just to introduce some consistency and order, please try to comment using the following format:**  

App Name + Imbedded Link - (Price, Platforms it runs on) - Description.  

Here's an example of what *not* to do:

*""Tried out Monument Valley, very fun puzzle game. You should check it out as well.""* 

No links, no price, no platform. Now I know Monument Valley is famous enough to not really need those things, but for the lesser known apps, this really is a pain.

I have no idea what any of this means. I can make an iCloud playlist, but can not add to it without making it a specific playlist to the device I am making the playlist on? What am I missing here.

This is just one of the many problems I am running into. The music suggestions are great, and the playlist that apple makes for me have really introduced me to some great music, but I am having a difficult time using it as I wanted.

edit: so the problem I was running into looks like it was because I started a radio station from a song on my computer, this would not let me add music from the station to a playlist? Seriously this is weird. I went to the ""New"" section and looked up the specific song and was able to add it. I then went to the song I started the station from in the ""New"" section and can now add music that comes up to a playlist. If this sounds way more crazy difficult than it should be, I can not agree more.

apple,Rules Regarding Tomorrow's Event,"Hey everyone! The mod team has had a long discussion regarding tomorrow's event, and we're all excited about the possibilities!

However, some things will change here at /r/apple during the event, and we'd like to share with you what's going to happen:

* All submissions will be turned off beginning at 1pm ET and will be turned back on as soon as the event is over.
* We will provide pre-event, event, and post-event megathreads that people can comment in and discuss what's happening.
* After the event, we will allow news submissions about announced products and services. We will, however, be actively removing duplicate threads. So please check /new before submitting news.

With that said, we want to take this opportunity to remind *everyone* about Rule #3:

&gt; No threads designed as rants (please message the mods if you have a specific concern).

We know that people will be upset if Apple announces another 16GB iPhone, the same protruding camera, etc. Please keep these concerns in the megathread and do not post new threads ranting about these things.

Lastly, as with all Apple events, there will be trolls coming to /r/apple who try to get people all worked up. First and foremost, don't let these people get under your skin. Just downvote and move on. However, and I can't reiterate this enough, just because someone has an opinion that isn't popular does *not* make them a troll. If you see obvious trolling, please report those comments. We will investigate and take action if necessary. An example of a troll is someone who is giving an uneducated opinion with the sole intention of getting under your skin. Again, do not report comments that simply disagree with you.

We're less than 24 hours away! We look forward to everything that will be announced tomorrow, and we'll see you then.

apple,Easter egg in Pencil unveil video: the cursive 'hello' being drawn matches the 'hello' shown on the screen of the original Macintosh in its own promotional materials.,"I'm new to the Apple subreddit, and I see that directly linking to images is against the rules, so I don't know if it's against the rules to link it here... but here's a link to images comparing the two (please correct me if this is inappropriate): http://imgur.com/a/kOy9p

The loop on the 'h' is one difference, but in 2007 when Steve Jobs was ramping up to the announcement of the first iPhone, he was recapping Apple's milestones and put an image of the Macintosh with a 'hello' on it, and this one lost the loop on the 'h' and, in fact, is an exact match of the 'hello' in the Pencil video.

EDIT: Okay, so maybe it's *not* an Easter Egg, at least from what I see here, because many of you say that this is more or less common knowledge and/or was presented in an obvious fashion. Well, that's fine, but I'm simply bringing a cool fact to the light for the sake of having a little fun. My jimmies remain unrustled. And, if yours are because I'm dumbing down this subreddit's feed, then take a nice walk and wait for this to move off the first page.",56,435,2015-09-10,AAPL,0.02867693267762661,0.9288930296897888,0.04242999851703644
apple,"Apple's ""Vision of Computing"": Steve Jobs said it in 2005: ""The file system management will be an app for pros, and consumers aren't going to use it.""","In yesterday's keynote Tim said the iPad was their ""vision of computing"". 

Steve said here in 2005, ""eventually the file system would be an app for pros, and consumers aren't going to need it""
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xES5-qDv-4Q

If you've ever been an IT person and watched someone use a computer, you know he's right (about the learning curve). It's 2015, and people still don't get the file system and the metaphors (have you ever personally put folders in folders in real life.. more than 2 levels deep?)

&lt;anecdote&gt;
I used to work in a college computer (english department) writing lab. Students would come in, write up their pages and pages of stuff, then put in their 3.5 disk, then hit save, then take the disk out...then wonder where their file went when they sat at a different computer (they never chose the disk).
&lt;/anecdote&gt;


I always felt that Steve was a Pareto principle (the 80/20 rule) kind of guy. Basically that 20% of the inputs produce 80% of the outputs. Let's say you have 100 friends, maybe 80% of your time spent with friends is with the same 20 people. .. then as Apple would do, let's get rid of the other 80 people.


This is why Apple has so few product lines, this is why they stopped making servers, (which 20% of our products make up 80% of our revenue?) let's be insanely great at those few products.This is what is going on with the iPad... what?


Basically, 20% of the features on your computer cover 80% of what people do on computers these days. (every time you see something about a cheap laptop/netbook people always say, ""it's perfect for web, facebook and email, which is what most people use computers for most of the time"")


**Consuming** media is what people do most 80% of time with their computer. In fact, we even refer to people as ""consumers"".  The iPad (and Amazon tablets too) are awesome at consuming: Web, email, music, videos, photos. The other 80% of the things your computer can do are not needed by ""most people"".


(more anecdotes)
If you're the ""family IT guy"", buy your mom an iPad (my mom is 68). It does everything she needs, and she hasn't called me for tech support in years. She can even print the occasional boarding pass using a printer that works with Apple Print. She has a e-ink kindle for reading.


Take a look at people's computers in an office, people have pretty much all their files on their desktop. This is so they know where they are. They can't find them otherwise. Or for fun. Ask that person to navigate to their ""documents"" folder using file explorer. They are already lost, some don't even know what file explorer is, or that's it's even called that.

I had emailed Tim Cook a few weeks back thanking him and his team for the introduction of the Apple Watch and telling him how it has motivated me to lose weight and be healthy. Since I got the watch to today, I've lost over 38 lbs and I'm nearing my goal weight of 180. A few days after emailing, I recieved a response from Tim Cook just saying thank you for the email and congratulating me on the weight loss. I was really impressed that I got a personal reply and showed my friends, but today really blew that out of the water. Within the first 5 minutes of the keynote, Tim Cook quoted my email on the screen and spoke about how Apple Watch users across the globe have been inspired to be healthier by the Watch. Really an awesome feeling to feel like a part of the Keynote!

I thought I'd post this here as I've been an avid /r/AppleWatch user since the introduction and recieved my first Apple Watch on launch day. I've read countless stories here and other places about the fitness-related benefits of the Watch and thought others here might enjoy seeing one of their own get mentioned! And to answer the most common question I've gotten, no, I had no prior warning or knowledge that I'd be mentioned and no free Apple swag or anything of that sort has come my way.

**Mod Note**: Yes, I realize I posted my personal facebook on Reddit, but it's a public post and I have already made several comments on Reddit that can connect my Facebook with my Reddit account.

**EDIT @ 6:18 GMT**

Now that there's been enough response, I thought you guys might want to compare with a survey from last year. The 4.7"" 64GB Space Grey is still king among Redditors, but you can see a bit of shift as well.

- 2% of you are crossing over from the the 6 to 6+ this year. 

- Last year 128 &amp; 16 were nearly a toss up. This year however, the 16GB population is less than half that of the 128GB buyers.

- Every color lost a few percentage points in favor of Rose Gold

apple,"iOS 9 is phenomenal so far. Not because of anything that was added, but because of really important things that work much, much faster / better","I have 30K photos in iCloud Photo Library (~100GB).  On iOS 8.4, if I swiped up from lock screen to camera, took a ~150 photo burst, and then hit the preview thumbnail to look at the photos I just took, I was looking at a ~45s wait.  

In iOS 9 it takes 3 seconds or less, its like instant. I'm blown away. This is with the same photo library and everything fully restored.  I can take a burst from lock screen and be looking at the burst instantly, and I still have effectively every photo I've ever taken in my library. It was *so slow* before, it just feels like magic now.

Another huge improvement: Airplay. Now when I select an airplay source, it sticks. And keeps playing to that source unless I just blatantly get out of range of the signal.  No more just random disconnect from my Apple TV halfway through a song when it's sitting there charging in the same room as the router.

Apple's claims have historically been very accurate especially concerning multicore performance as compared in synthetic benchmarks such as Geekbench or browser benchmarks. Although we don't know how many cores the iPad Pro A9X has, it's likely quad-core since a tri-core design would require vastly higher clockspeeds or instructions per clock (80% higher). If the A9X is quad-core, then it only requires ~35% better performance per core compared to the tri-core A8X.

Something nice to consider when you're buying that iPhone 6s+ in 128 gigabytes in rose gold these upcoming weeks. Or.. if you're waiting for that iPhone 7 next year and you have some money in your savings account, consider investing a few shares into Apple. It might help get you that upgrade from that base 16 gigabyte storage to 128 gigabytes.. :'D

This is something I've done a bunch of times in the past, but today I just discovered - it no longer works.  Thanks to a recent OS or iTunes update - I'm not sure when it happened, but now you get [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZVeSgxv.jpg)

My plan was to use Skitch to draw over the image to draw attention to an area and share that with a friend.  All in support of an eMail conversation we were having as a result of buying the movie last night from iTunes.


...I was not going to sell the image as my own.

...I was not going to blow it up to a billboard size and publicly display it.

...I was not going to rob *the industry* of any money it all.  In fact, this is a movie I purchased in the first place.



I really hate this trend, Apple.  I **really** do.  

All you have done is forced me to find a way to do this.  If it means I have to play it on my iPad and photocopy it at Kinkos in color... I am going to do it.  You have prevented nothing, just made me angry.",166,190,2015-09-14,AAPL,0.029876062646508217,0.9242985248565674,0.04582544043660164

iphone,Facebook drained 84% of my battery over night.,"So last night I re downloaded the Facebook app after using safari for Facebook. This was around 8pm and from 8 pm to about 11pm when I got into bed I really only used it on my phone a few times because usually when I'm home I just browse on my iPad. Went to bed at 11pm with 95% battery and woke up with the phone COMPLETELY dead. Wouldn't turn on for shit, so I threw the charger on it and when I was able to use the screen again I checked the usage and what do you know, 84% and I hadn't even used it? How is that possible that it was doing so much background info?

For reference I have a iPhone 6 Plus.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies and help guys/gals! I've deleted the Facebook app and have switched over to Friendly. I liked it so much that I bought the paid version which comes with an Adblock.

apple,Upgraded from iPad 3 to iPad Air 2 yesterday. A few thoughts after 24 hours.,"Just a few thoughts about the upgrade I thought I'd share for anyone else looking at upgrading.

- This thing is ridiculously thin. I feel like I could use it as a knife.

- It doesn't particularly feel any lighter to me. But it hasn't fallen on my face yet.

- While the same resolution, the screen does look better thanks to the whole laminating process.

- WHY DID THEY REMOVE THE SWITCH ON THE SIDE?!? I've gone to use it multiple times to lock my rotation. Something I seriously miss.

- Touch ID is nice but isn't entirely reliable for me. But neither is the scanner on my Galaxy S6 so I guess it's just me.

- This thing is snappy. There is no delay to opening an app and using it. I can see why they didn't update it the Air line this year.

- The speakers are very loud, but because of this the iPad vibrates like crazy.

- WiFi connection doesn't seem any better or worse, but this is most likely because of my Uni's WiFi.

- I can't comment on the Camera because I haven't used. Mainly because I'd look like a moron.

- 2GB of RAM is a godsend. I was browsing... my favourite Real Estate site last night (Come on we all have one)... and had multiple tabs open and not a single one had to reload.

All in all it's amazing upgrade and with the Split-Screen features have made it even better. I'll be using this for many years to come (Hopefully, unless Apple cripple it with iOS 10 or something).",179,200,2015-09-17,AAPL,0.030179917812347412,0.9028905630111694,0.06692949682474136

apple,Vogue lies about using the iPhone 6S in a fashion show photoshoot,"**UPDATE: The photographer came through. It was a mistake and they used the wrong photos. The new ones have been posted and are actually a lot better than I thought they would be: http://i.imgur.com/Nszradn.jpg (6 on the left, 6S on the right). Hiding my pitchfork now.**

Yesterday Vogue posted an article claiming to be the first ones to use the iPhone 6S in a fashion show photo shoot: http://www.vogue.com/13349393/iphone-6s-nyfw-photo-diary-kevin-lu/

They linked several photos claiming to have been taken on the iPhone 6S by a photographer named Kevin Lu (@sweatengine on twitter).

If you play around with Safari or Chrome's inspector you can access the original untouched photos and their EXIF data reveals they were taken on an iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 8.4.1 and are 8mpx only.

Dropbox link in case Vogue takes them down: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m71zwxja72lkxv1/AACEzuCK_fcx7CRq6wecmZqQa?dl=0

So either they lied about getting their hands on a 6S, or they screwed up and used the wrong phone. 

It seems strange they would lie about this when Apple has always been pretty honest about using real photos taken on real devices. At the very least this deserves an explanation from Vogue.

apple,Bad things I've discovered using an iPhone 6S,"Coming from an iPhone 6 Plus I've observed some strange things in my new iPhone 6S.

**EDIT: Update! I can confirm that on the 9.1 Beta 2 you can now listen to audio while taking photos in the camera app. It also works with Live Photos enabled!** 

1. **Lower Volume Out of Headphone Jack** I plugged in my new phone though the AUX jack on my car and turned the phone volume to max. Previously a level 10 on the stereo would provide a decentely loud and comfortable listening level on all of my old iPhones. With the 6S I had to turn up the volume to 18 on the car stereo to achieve a similar volume output. There is no max volume limiter set on the phone. The same thing is true when playing through my ear pods.

2. **Audio Turns Off When Using the Camera** - I like to listen to music and podcasts through headphones while taking pictures on my phone. Before, audio would continue playing in the camera app while taking pictures unless you switched to video mode. Now the audio pauses annoyingly when you open the camera. I tried toggling on and off live photos to no avail. Manually trying to play audio through control center didn't work either.

3. **Camera App Crashes** - Multiple times my camera app crashed while taking photos. This also occurred often in 3rd party camera apps. I had to exit the app, close it via app switcher, and relaunch the app for it to operate again. This isn't lag, it's a full crash. One time the screen just went black and wouldn't come back until I restarted. I can't remember this ever happening with the stock camera app on my 6 Plus or on previous iPhones.

4. **Lower Quality Bottom Speaker** - this one really annoys me because I suspect it's not software fixable. The speaker on the new phone sounds noticeably tinnier and quieter than previous phones.
I'm running iOS 9.0.1.

Hopefully most of these things will be addressed in future software updates. Just thought I would share my experiences.",201,184,2015-09-27,AAPL,0.10243017971515656,0.8709515333175659,0.026618320494890213

I took a new job 4 months ago and was given an iPhone 6 for business. It's almost impossible, imo, to explain how the transition occured. It was a rocky start, but once I got used to iOS, I slowly began to realize that I was enjoying it much MUCH more than my Android.  It's not even about things being ""easier"", it's about things being more intuitive. iOS just FEELS like it was designed for human beings. It feels like a piece of technology that blurs the line between human input and electronic output.  Android, imo, thickens that line, and I realize why some people like it that way.  I've realized that Android phones have certain software-related capabilities that iPhones lack, but I suppose I've just outgrown the desire to take advantage of them. I'll miss the free GBA emulators though ;)

Well my thoughts:

Nexus 6P // Finally the Android phone I could hopefully (not holding my breath) get with great battery, screen, storage options as well as camera and consistent updates/OS support from the handset manufacturer. How ever this is anyone who is interested in Androids hope every year with the Nexus devices.

Nexus 5X // Meh. Not too interested in this devices as it has a very low amount of RAM for Android as well as I am now too used to the larger form factor, and with the Motorola handsets this year it is hard to justify the 5X.

Pixel C // This looks fantastic! How ever after owning a Nexus 9 briefly, and then seeing all the stories of the longevity+usability of the device long term...I am very disenchanted with the idea of ever getting a good android tablet. 

Chromcast // STOKED. I own 3 chromecasts, 2 placed around my house and 1 in my car to bring around. The ease of being able to cast almost any media application from iOS or Android is amazing.
