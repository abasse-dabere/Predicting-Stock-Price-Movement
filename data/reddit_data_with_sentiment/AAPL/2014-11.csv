mac,"Mac Voodoo 101 (A.K.A. ""What does this crap actually do?"")","I'm recalling [a thread a few months back](http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/22hpp0/macbook_pro_stalls_for_510_seconds_at_a_time/cgnj69d?context=5) in which someone used the phrase ""Voodoo Fixes"" to describe the general measures we take in troubleshooting issues with Macs such as resetting the NVRAM and SMC, repairing the filesystem and permissions, clearing caches.

As I said then, I like the ""Voodoo"" qualification since it accurately describes the nature of these measures; for the most part, their workings are mysterious, and who knows if and when they will actually have any effect. So in this post, I'm going to do my best to clear some of that up.

----

[**Resetting the NVRAM**](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14222)

""Non-Volatile Random Access Memory"" is a small unit of data storage which the firmware can access in the pre-boot stages of turning on the computer. This function was previously fulfilled by PRAM (Parameter Random Access Memory) in PowerPC-based Macs.

The NVRAM stores settings related to what OS to boot, what options to use when booting that OS, Bluetooth keyboard and mouse pairings for use in startup sequences (such as holding the option key to display the boot manager), and a few other things such as Wi-Fi network credentials for booting in internet recovery if need be. Resetting these settings can be useful for the following issues:

* Delays on startup
* Failure to boot
* Failure to alter boot modes on startup, such as holdng the option key to view the boot manager
* Weird display output issues while booting

Potential side effects from resetting the NVRAM:

* Alternate boot choices, such as a secondary installation of OS X, or applications such as rEFIt or rEFInd, are lost
* Alternate boot options, such as those required by software such as TRIM Enabler, are lost, possibly rendering the system un-bootable
* The list of Wi-Fi networks which can be used to boot into internet recovery is lost (that is, until booting back into OS X again)

---

[**Resetting the SMC**](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964)

The System Management Controller is a chip which arbitrates certain power-related functions of the computer. It has access to information about the machine's temperature sensors, fans, display lid, battery and AC power, and keyboard and display backlighting... OS X gets this information from the SMC. Resetting the state of the SMC can be relevant to the following issues:

* Improper fan behavior
* Unresponsive AC adapter
* Incorrect battery readings
* Improper reaction to closing the laptop lid
* Improper backlighting response to ambient light

Potential side effects from resetting the SMC:

* Custom fan behaviors, such as those set by software such as smcFanControl, are lost

---

[**Permissions Repair**](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1452)

I hate to say it, but a permissions repair is probably one of the most ""Voodoo"" measures of them all.

When running a permissions repair, OS X goes through a list of files that have been installed by OS X's package management system (e.g. the original OS X installation, the App Store, and some third-party `.pkg` files), and makes sure that the permissions of the installed files still match up with how they were specified in the packages.

It is not common for permissions of installed files to be made incorrect in such a way so as to cause problematic side-effects, however there may be two benefits to running a permissions repair:

* Improving the security of files which do not need to be readable or writeable by any user other than the system
* Fixing non-system software which has become broken as a result of it losing permission to access files which it depends on

apple,Cracked my iPhone 6 screen yesterday... and got the phone replaced for free!,"For the record, I don't have AppleCare+ and I've had my phone for about 6 weeks 

Yesterday while getting out of my car, my phone slipped out of my gym shorts and hit the sidewalk. I came to a complete halt and slowly but carefully picked up my phone. ""Maybe it got a couple of scratches and that's it?"" But when I flipped the phone over, I discovered that it had a bunch of spiderweb cracks. 

My initial reaction (besides calling myself stupid for not getting a better case sooner) was to google what other people did when they cracked their iphone 6 screens. Maybe I could lie about what happened to the Apple store for a new phone? How much of an asshole do I need to be when I'm complaining? Is the damage covered under warranty? What's the cost to repair the damages myself? I decided my best option was to see if the Apple store could do anything. If not, I'd try to repair the screen myself. 

I showed up at the Apple store and made a walk-in appointment. After waiting for a little more than an hour, one of the genius bar guys came up to me to help me out. I was trying to come up with some elaborate story that didn't pin the problem on me, but I was like, ""fuck it"". 

I told him ""To be honest, the phone slipped out of my pocket and hit the floor. Is the damage covered under warranty? Is there anything you can do to fix it?"" 

""Unfortunately, Apple does not cover accidental damages. We can, however, fix the screen for $109 if you want"" 

As I pulled out my wallet to grab my credit card, I remembered that I had another small problem with my phone. The problem happened when I used headphones that weren't Apple's. If I tapped the area above the headphone jack, sometimes it would skip songs, repeat songs, or activate Siri. I told him the problem and asked ""Is this by any chance covered under warranty?"" 

He took out one of his headphones and plugged it into my phone. After tapping the volume buttons and messing with the stop/play button, he concluded that he couldn't detect anything wrong. ""But"" he smiled, ""I'll take your word for it that it IS damaged and replace the whole phone for you."" 

Anyways I just wanted to say that DAMN, Apple you got some fine customer service. Or you hire some awesome employees. I came into the store expecting them to state it was all my fault and not help me whatsoever, but I left the store happily (and with my new replacement). Also shoutout to that employee who I'll only say has a first name starting with the letter A, you made my day man!",87,131,2014-11-03,AAPL,0.1249295026063919,0.835084855556488,0.03998565301299095

apple,My (lengthy) review of the iPad Air 2 after 2 weeks of use as someone who mainly uses Android,"Edit: please read the post before saying my issues are  because of jailbreak. I had the issues before I decided to jailbreak and then doing the jailbreak introduced no new issues and the old ones persisted. 


Some context:  I wouldn't call myself an average consumer and am an avid tech enthusiast.  I love researching phones and tablets specifically since I think that they are the coolest technology currently.  I own an HTC One M7, previously owned an S2, I owned a Note 10.1 2014 edition tablet for 4 months before reselling it, and I tried out a Nexus 7 2013 for 2 weeks before returning it since I felt it was too small.  I picked up the iPad Air 2 because I have generally enjoyed using my mom's iPad in the past and considering the specs and form factor I was excited to try it.  I do not have brand loyalty when it comes to technology and just want what I feel works best for me and and what I feel is a good value for the amount spent.  My phone is rooted and has a custom rom (as was my previous phone and both tablets that I have personally owned).  I used this iPad for 1 week without jailbreaking and then for another week with jailbreak.  Please note that all of the following is subjective for ME personally. I have a tower at home that I built, I use Windows and Ubuntu at work, and I have used OSX quite a bit on macbooks.

General likes:

1.  Performance on this tablet is absolutely incredible.  Everything feels so damn smooth and responsive.  Scrolling anywhere is much smoother than on my previous tablets and I always loved this about my mom's iPad and iPhone.  After jailbreaking and installing the NoSlowAnimations tweak and turning off the animations completely, I don't think there is anything else on the market as far as tablets or phones that can keep up with this device.  Things load IMMEDIATELY or go to the splash screen immediately.  This thing is a speed demon.  The one thing I would like is that while scrolling IS very smooth, I like the way Android lets you swipe the screen up or down and scroll up or down very quickly.  Tapping the notification bar on iOS to go to the top is nice (also possible via xposed on Android, but it works better natively on iOS), but I would like a way to scroll downwards quickly as well.

2. Swiping from the left edge of the screen to go back almost always works and I find this quite awesome.  There is an Xposed module that accomplishes something similar on Android but I find that redundant with the backbutton already present.  I don't miss the back button very much except when apps remove this swipe back gesture and put a button on the top left or right of their GUI.

3. The screen is absolutely fantastic.  There is no light bleed (my Note tablet had a bit of light bleed in dark rooms) and the viewing angles are fantastic.  Everything looks clear and sharp and the autobrightness is absolutely amazing.  I rarely have to change the brightness with it enabled and the transition in brightness is extremely smooth.

4. Battery life is pretty good, doesn't seem mindblowingly better than the note. This might be due to me using this tablet for gaming from time to time (hearthstone 1-2 matches a day) vs. I didn't play games at all on the note. My note also had a custom rom on it which severely limited network usage when the tablet was off and achieved deep sleep and idle battery life similar to this iPad. Seems like the battery doesn't dip much when I'm using it but then it ""catches up"" a short while after turning the screen off if that makes sense.  It charges at a rate of about 50% after 1.5 hours with the device powered off.

5.  Ability to natively connect via VPN is pretty nice and very easy to set up.

6. I haven't installed third party keyboards surprisingly. I find it very easy to type in portrait mode on this compared to the note tablet. The auto correct isn't on the same level as swiftkey, but having the tweaks to scroll left and right by swiping on the keyboard are preferred for me than swiftkey's autocorrect.

7. Most apps do look much nicer compared to their android counter parts (even the google apps look much nicer but I don't have the material update yet for several of mine yet), but I find that this issue is a bit exaggerated.  I only had issues with Facebook and Slickdeals apps looking like crap on my Android tablet and everything else was fine.

8.  Voice detection with Siri is very good and iMessage is really nice.

9. Build quality is awesome. The device feels very solid and premium and similar to my M7 I like how the body feels cool when I pick it up in the mornings or evenings.  The weight is great for using it in one hand as well.

10. The multitasking gestures are amazing!  Swiping left or right with 4-5 fingers is insanely responsive as well as pinching to go to the homescreen.  They ALWAYS work except for swiping up to get to the recent apps dialog which usually takes 1-2 tries.

11. It is extremely easy to make a full backup of the device.  On android, you have to have a custom recovery and make make a nandroid backup which is simple after you unlock your bootloader and have a custom recovery in the first place, but this method is much simpler and easier.

12. Permission control is flat out incredible.  This is only possible currently on android devices by using xposed modules AFAIK.

General dislikes and issues **(let me reiterate that these issues were there before I jailbroke the device)**:

1. This thing seems to freeze very often.  On my second day with the tablet while opening safari the entire unit froze and holding the power button did nothing, after a few minutes it rebooted fine. This happened again the following day opening a different application another day and the icon changed colors as though I had clicked it but then the app did not open.  All button and screen inputs caused no response and I was able to reset it by holding the power button and home button at the same time instead of waiting for it to reset on its own. This has since happened roughly once every other day. 

2. Apps randomly crash multiple times a day (big ones not just obscure random ones).  I find the difference in how google and apple handle app crashes interesting (just going to the home screen vs. telling you something stopped responding).   I attribute this and the point above to iOS 8 issues since they do not occur on my mom's ipad. 

3. I dislike how apps install on page 2 by default and I would like to be able to reorganize the home screen to just have apps at the bottom.  There is probably a jailbreak tweak to fix this but I don't really see the value in this default behavior.  I also dislike how you are required to enter in your password every time you install a free app, but touchID makes this less of an issue.

4.  There is a lot of wasted screen real estate.  Folders should display more than just 9 icons by default and the recent apps interface (double tapping the home button) should show more than just 3 applications.  The recent apps interface is also one of my complaints with stock android and I prefer the way that HTC implements this on [Sense](http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/628x/images/KYmM/htc-sense-5-review-11.jpg) and how Samsung implements this in their tablet UI for Touchwhiz (can't find a screenshot but it brings up an overlay with several visible).  It is almost always faster to just go to the springboard and then select a different application.

5. The entire tablet vibrates when using the speakers.  This is probably because of how thin the device is and is distracting when watching videos.  I also find the speaker placement is also less than ideal as it was with my previous tablets as well.  Also at least once a day, when opening a video the tablet makes a popping noise before starting the audio.  This might be a device specific defect.

6. Seeking in videos requires you to click on the current position and then drag it.  If you are off by a fraction of an inch it swipes the entire screen instead (depending on the application) and usually takes me more than one try to actually select the indicator.  I think having gestures would be nice and there is a jailbreak tweak that accomplishes this for the default video player but this does not work in videos playing on Safari.  Also having volume controls on the bottom while having seek at the top is very unergonomic.

7.  Chromecast usage isn't as great as it is on my phone or previous tablets.  I like how on Android once you start casting a video it stays in your notification tray or on your lockscreen and you can always pull down or turn the device on and then control the video.  Using Netflix, I always have to reopen the application which then needs to almost always reload and then I have to wait for it to realize that it is connected to my Chromecast before controlling the video.

8.  Reddit apps on iPads suck compared to Android.  Alien Blue is great ON iPHONES, but on tablets it is absolutely terrible.  It does not respond to touches or gestures quite frequently.  There are no spoiler tags.  It does not sync up to your multi-reddits (you have to create new groups and enter them in manually) and a few other issues make me never use it other than for seeing notifications).  AMRC doesn't actually sort the way I want it to half the time and doesn't even have a search feature in the free version, Baconreader crashes way too often, and I couldn't find another one that I was completely happy with.

9. Switching from landscape to portrait and vice versa sometimes caused the keyboard to not change orientation as well.

10.  TouchID works 100% of the time when I'm using it to approve an app download but about 50% of the time when trying to log into the iPad itself.  I have already tried overtraining each finger but I still have issues with this.

* General comments:
 1. Overall I like this tablet a lot but I don't think that it is a good value for me personally.  I mainly use my tablet to browse reddit, read articles, and watch some videos in bed and I think for those purposes I would be happier getting a cheaper android tablet since the reddit applications on Android tablets are much better for me.
 2. Camera - no idea on the rear camera as I will probably never use it other than for scanning barcodes into MFP. Front facing camera is fairly nice.
 3. I don't miss the spen very much. I used it very infrequently mainly to write some letters to friends and have some more precise control of where I dropped units in Clash.
 4.  I don't miss the multitasking that Samsung has implemented on their tablet UIs very much either even though multiwindow and penwindows are really great.  I just did not use these features very much since getting my Chromecast.

I would be happy to ask any questions you guys might have.  I am going to return this tablet tonight because of what I have stated above and I'm going to get a Nexus 9 and pray it does not have build quality issues and do a review of that if this is received well.",131,82,2014-11-07,AAPL,0.04084066115319729,0.9150984287261963,0.04406086479624113

apple,Apple support is not always butterflies and rainbows.,"Sitting here with my wife who's at her wits end. Has an iPhone 5, had issues with the battery and got it replaced about a month ago. We happened to be in Charlotte NC and got it done at the Apple Store while there. We live about 3 1/2 hrs from a store. The replacement battery never worked right. The phone still cannot hold a charge, shuts down at 43% and is just erratic as hell. She finally calls Apple, waits about 20 minutes for a rep, explains the problem, they put her on hold, and about another ten minutes later she's disconnected. She calls back and goes through the whole process again, explains what happened to the rep, who takes her number and promises to call back if she gets disconnected again. The rep wants her to send the phone back to apple and go to verizon to get a loaner phone. My wife asks if apple would just send a replacement to her so that she does not have to deal with verizon. The rep says she's going to ask her manager, puts my wife on hold, and of course she gets disconnected again. That was about fifteen minutes ago (it's 11:20am here) and no call back. We are not very happy with Apple right now and aren't sure what to do. Calling back for a third time seems a waste; we've already spent over an hour on the phone this morning and we've gotten nowhere.

EDIT:  Despite the bitchy tone of my post, I truly came here for advice and as usual the /r/apple folks did not disappoint!  Thanks to everyone who offered helpful advice.  We haven't restored the phone on our own, so we'll do that before we call back and give customer support another go. I'm sure it will all be resolved eventually!

UPDATE: 10:15pm - We called back and finally got through to a senior advisor, after some holds and quite a lot of waiting (no fault of Apple, if they're busy then what can you do?)  Anyway, through the awesomeness of Garrett, a new (or at least a replacement) phone is on its way. We did have to give a credit card # so that a charge hold would be placed pending the return of the phone with the issues. No big deal. Thanks again to the folks who offered helpful advice.

apple,Beta testers wanted: Enable Continuity with a USB BT4 dongle on your old Mac,"Hello everyone,

The next version of the Continuity Activation Tool is being prepared and will add support for a selection of old Macs that have BT 4.0 USB dongles. 

**Please help me identify which Macs would support Continuity just by adding a dongle and using CAT v.2.0**. This will later be very helpful for the community. For example: I've received confirmation that plugging in a USB BT4 dongle on 2010 15"" and 17"" MacBook Pro's and using the v.2.0 of the tool enables Continuity, which previously required an expensive/complicated internal card replacement.

If you have a Mac and a USB BT4 dongle, ~~sign up for the beta, and I will send you a pre-release version with testing instructions~~ stay tuned for the next version of CAT.

Thanks for your support!

**Update 24.11.2014**

* I'm back to the drawing board as OS X 10.10.2 seems to have new Bluetooth drivers that break compatibility with 3rd party devices even after patching. CAT v1.x users are not affected.
* I'm putting the beta on hold for the moment as a result. I'll get back in touch if/when, I'll find a new solution.

**Update 14.11.2014**

* A lot of you have signed up and received the first beta - thanks a lot for your participation!

* A few iMacs have an Atheros AirPort card which doesn't support Continuity, even when adding a BT4 dongle. To know if you're affected, run the CAT System Diagnostic. Broadcom=&gt;good, Atheros=&gt;bad.

* There are a few spots left for pre-2011 MacBook (regular / Pro / Air / Aluminum), Mac mini, and Mac Pro owners willing to actively beta test and give feedback.

* When signing up or giving feedback, please clearly state if you are using a Hackintosh.

* Beta 2 includes a fix that enables Continuity on many additional Mac models. I've received confirmation that an aluminium MacBook from 2008 is currently using Continuity. Your testing efforts and feedback made this possible!",53,144,2014-11-12,AAPL,0.048481330275535583,0.9200747609138489,0.03144385665655136

iphone,Telemarketers spoofing my own phone number. What happens if I block my own number?,"Ever since they added the ability to block numbers in iOS, I've been using it every time I get a telemarketer call.  They rotate through numbers, but I found that blocking the number after any call has cut down on the number of calls I get significantly.  But now those assholes have started using a new tactic: they spoof your own phone number.  So my phone will ring, and the caller ID says that it's a call from the very phone I'm holding in my hand.  So my question is, will it cause any problems if I block my own phone number?  Obviously I'm never going to call my iPhone from my iPhone.  But could it potentially screw anything else up?

On a side note, fuck those assholes from ""cardholder services"".  (That's what every one of their robocalls starts with: a female voice saying, ""This is ___ from cardholder services."")  They're the only scammers/telemarketers who have me on their list, and before I started blocking numbers, I would get at least 1-2 calls a day from those fuckers.  I'm on the do not call list, and had been reporting them, but clearly that does nothing.

**Edit:** To everyone saying to report them, put my name on the ""do not call"" list, etc., I appreciate the advice, but believe me, I've tried all of that.  I have come to the conclusion at this point that the government is completely powerless against these guys.  I've been on the ""do not call"" list since it was created, and have renewed when necessary.  I've reported them many, many times, but obviously nothing ever happens.  If you want more info about these assholes, just [Google ""cardholder services""](https://www.google.com/#q=%22cardholder+services%22).  They're the only scammers who call me.  Like I said, before iOS let me start blocking the numbers each time I got a call, I was getting 1 or 2 calls a day from them.  They do use the same numbers over and over for a while before switching, so blocking the numbers helps somewhat.  Now that they've started spoofing my own number when they call, I'm going to go ahead and block my own number and see what happens.  I don't think it should hurt anything.

According to what I've read about them, their scam is to put you into a three-way conference with your own credit card company to help you try to negotiate a better rate, but then they charge you an insane fee.  What's funny is that I do not have, nor have I ever had, a credit card.  So there is literally nothing they can get from me.",49,123,2014-11-13,AAPL,0.19481521844863892,0.7851619720458984,0.02002272754907608
apple,How I was pretty much pigeonholed into getting a repair due to an Apple Store Employee damaging my laptop.,"I'm honestly really upset that this whole thing happened, and how the apple store manager dealt with the situation.

I had developed a hairline fracture on my laptop's bottom left corner (retina late 2013). The screen damage was minimal; only a fraction of the portion of the screen underneath the dock was rendered unseeable because of the crack. I went into the apple store last night hoping I could get it still repaired due to the warranty. I am helped by a nice apple employee and he takes a look at the screen and says there's a fracture; he says he will have one of his techs take a look at the screen to confirm his suspicions. This tech eventually comes by; nice apple employee tells the tech there is a possible screen fracture. Now, this tech, WITHOUT asking my permission or telling me any details, PUSHES HARD right onto the screen fracture and says ""Yeah, screen fracture."" And walks away. At this point I'm shitting my pants, because you don't just put pressure into a damn screen fracture, that only makes it worse. Now, the whole quarter bottom of my screen, including the dock all across horizontally and an inch or two above, are completely rendered unseeable. This damn tech made the issue 10x worse. I'm quoted 800 dollars as the repair for the screen. I notice the damage and ask to see the manager. I tell her that I wasn't notified what the tech would do, and he MADE THE PROBLEM WORSE. Let me be clear: I had absolutely no intention of paying money to have the screen repaired because it wasn't too large of an issue.  If they said warranty didn't cover it, I was going to just walk out of there. 

The manager and I speak and she says she's not going to give me a free repair because I came in with a ""broken product"".  I tell her that the tech damaged it and it was absolutely on him and I could not be held responsible for his damaging. At this point we continue circling around this point and she says she will be back after talking to someone and figuring things out. 

She comes out and says she can give me a 200 dollar discount from the in store repair price ($680). So it would cost me 480. At this point we continue talking and I'm absolutely barracaded in; I am a broke ass college student, but I need this damn computer for my work. I had to pay for this repair, because I had NO choice.

Needless to say I'm really angry that I had to pay for this repair when the tech damaged it further.

Sorry for the heavily abbreviated version, I have no computer now and typing on an iphone is tiring.

What should I do? How would I go about filing a complaint or getting some help with this issue?

EDIT: Some people have been calling bullshit because of the price of the repair. Total cost was not 800, it was around 740 or so with labor included. Yes, I rounded up. I exaggerated slightly about the cost.
The price of the 15 inch retina display is far greater than that of a 13 inch.",134,117,2014-11-13,AAPL,0.17936179041862488,0.7882874608039856,0.0323508195579052

apple,/r/Apple Minecraft Server,"**Server Out (BETA)**


Thanks to everyone who took the survey and expressed their interest below, I have taken today to set the server up in beta. During this short period things will change until we are satisfied. PVP will be disabled, the server will be open to anyone and the spawn will be temporary during this time. However, in a short time we will go out of beta and an announcement will be released about changes (mostly minor).


Please pop on using Minecraft 1.8 using the IP: **198.20.94.109** and begin playing! I will be looking for experienced builders from within the community to build a new spawn. The server was and is being build using [the data collected in the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-VJYWNJVV/). Again, however, things are subject to change.



Thank you!

Greetings, fellow /r/Apple users! I have been contemplating starting a Minecraft server for this subreddit and those who love Apple. It'll be a survival server (1.8). It could be PVP depending on what everyone else wants. Basically it'd be a normal Minecraft server but people would be encouraged to build Apple-style things, there would be chat announcements for new posts on this subreddit, and the moderators from this subreddit would all be invited to moderate the server as well.



I am excited to start this but will only do so if there is interest. Please let me know here if you'd be interested and if so, any ideas you have for it.


I have owned several servers in the past and am very familiar with Bukkit, plugins and other systems. I would also cover all the costs of hosting the server on a hosting service.


Thank you.


**UPDATE 1**

I'm just an unknown developer not making any money from the app. I got tired of checking the internet every time for new stuff to appear, it's just easier to receive a notification when something happens or changes. All the notifications are self-contained so there is no need to open the app when you receive one.

**Hooks app**

Create custom alerts for sports, tv shows, weather, news, coupons, new restaurants e.g. new restaurant in NYC hits top on tripadvisor, new Big Bang Theory episode is out, NBA match ended with score and 1k+ also looking for ideas.

Usage: set up an alert and you will receive a notification when something happens.

apple,The most important part of the WatchKit announcement for users - come see what  Watch apps can (and can't) do!,"https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/WatchHumanInterfaceGuidelines/index.html

This is the HIG, it's a nicely designed page, and by clicking through the sections listed on the left, you can quickly and easily see exactly what  Watch apps will be capable of.  Some highlights:

* ** Watch applications, initially at least, require an iPhone and *are not standalone* - they require an iPhone because the iPhone actually handles the processing of any logic as well as rendering of animations. When you design an animation in your  Watch app, the iPhone actually renders out the animation, and sends it to the watch as a series of images. Kinda crazy!**
*  Watch apps can have only two possible designs - Hierarchal (think how Email app works), and Page Based (think how Weather app works)
* 'Glances' are read-only and are based on pre-defined templates (no interaction allowed), tapping a glance will open the host app
* Notifications will allow for custom controls, but some predefined controls (like 'Dismiss') will always be present
* **One question I have been pondering for a while has been answered - the smaller  Watch model has *fewer pixels* than the larger model. The smaller model is 272x340 while the larger model is 312x390.**  App designs must accommodate both layouts accordingly.

apple,Hey Siri feature surprised and terrified my wife-,"A few weeks ago, my wife replaced a cracked iPhone 4 with a new iPhone 6. She doesn't fully understand how to use Siri, and has a moderate Chinese accent when speaking to the phone, so it often misinterprets words. Neither of us knew about the ""Hey Siri"" feature until today.

Last night around midnight we were talking before bed about, of all things, the NSA's data storage center in Utah. I said ""Well, they can collect information on what we buy, what we search for, who we talk to, and where we go, but its all based on key words; there's no reason to pay attention to the average person, so I'm not worried. She said ""But seriously, I'm uncomfortable with how much information the government is collecting about everyone..."" and THE PHONE answered, from across the room, on the charger, with no prompt or contact ""You know, I never really thought about that"". 

My wife was terrified; she yelped, got up, turned it off and starts talking about how she wants a flip phone now so the government and new AI's can't listen in on our conversations. I'm the one who likes Science Fiction, but she took her foray into the deep end last night!

iphone,"Hey Siri surprised wife, she now thinks NSA is eavesdropping on us through the phone","A few weeks ago, my wife replaced a cracked iPhone 4 with a new iPhone 6. She doesn't fully understand how to use Siri, and has a moderate Chinese accent when speaking to the phone, so it often misinterprets words. Neither of us knew about the ""Hey Siri"" feature until today.

Last night around midnight we were talking before bed about, of all things, the NSA's data storage center in Utah. I said ""Well, they can collect information on what we buy, what we search for, who we talk to, and where we go, but its all based on key words; there's no reason to pay attention to the average person, so I'm not worried. She said ""But seriously, I'm uncomfortable with how much information the government is collecting about everyone..."" and THE PHONE answered, from across the room, on the charger, with no prompt or contact ""You know, I never really thought about that"".

My wife was terrified; she yelped, got up, turned it off and starts talking about how she wants a flip phone now so the government and new AI's can't listen in on our conversations. I'm the one who likes Science Fiction, but she took her foray into the deep end last night!

apple,I made a small Mac app for myself to easily import huge iTunes playlists to Spotify and I just made it Open Source,"https://github.com/lapfelix/SpotifyPlaylistImport/releases

My main goal was to import my iTunes playlists to Spotify and to learn Swift a little bit.

To use it, export your iTunes playlist to XML (File &gt; Library &gt; Export Playlist) and select it within the app.
Once it fetched all the track URIs, the whole thing will be copied to your clipboard so it can easily be pasted in Spotify

It's the first Mac app I've ever made and the first time I've ever written an app in Swift
And yes I am aware that the code is awful, but it works! (And it's pretty fast)
I might make it better when I have the time

Scrolling through huge artist lists with hundreds of songs, weird/incorrect/missing artist images that were sourced from who knows where, huge album art so only a handful of albums were visible at a time. I spent a lot of time looking for a 3d party solution. I didn't want gimmicks and overwrought interfaces, just a simple iOS7/8 consistent design that restored iOS6 functionality, plus a couple of features that were missing. I couldn't find something I liked, so I decided to teach myself objective-C and develop my own.

The result is Cesium, and it just went live in the App Store. It's a lightweight music player that makes music navigation simple and intuitive.

 
Additional features:

* Utilizes existing device/itunes music library.
* Restores nested browsing. Focus in on your music collection with laser precision.
* Artist view. No more scrolling through Artist views with hundreds of songs. Sort albums by title or chronologically (ascending or descending).
* Tag responsive. Cesium dynamically adjusts presentation based on available track tags, including Sort fields.
* Classical Mode. When enabled, all music tagged as ""Classical"" in genres will use the Composer field instead of Artist/Album Artist.
* iCloud support. Toggle visibility of iTunes Match and/or purchased tracks.
* On-demand scrolling of long song titles, album or artist names, etc. Simply tap and hold.
* Gesture controls. Enable to safely control playback while driving.
* Seamless iOS7/8 design.
* Native display support for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

I usually send my device to sleep using the power-button, when I'm done using it. Especially when I just quickly glanced at it and want to put it back into my pocket.

However the sleep/wake button is now directly opposing the Volume-Up button and in most of the cases, where I try to send the phone to sleep, I will increase the volume.

iphone,"The dreaded, mysterious, insufferable, and relentless ""OTHER"" data: What is it, and how do I get rid of it? 38GB of ""OTHER"" data on my new 128GB phone is ludicrous.","I'm not exaggerating when I say that **the data storage called ""OTHER"" on my iPhones (plural) has been the equivalent of a ""*digital tumor*""**.   

Like a tumor, the ""OTHER"" data just grows and grows with no control, and it's not like the growth substance is malicious (for example, tumors are just the abnormal growth of tissue, while ""OTHER"" data is just abnormal growth of data or something).

Ever since I got the iPhone 4, this mysterious ""OTHER"" data, which is colored yellow/orange on the capacity ""bar.""  [**Here is an example of what it looks like when this ""OTHER"" data takes up a good amount of wh**](http://i.imgur.com/TJmAQbG.jpg).  Yes, that's 4.59 of ""OTHER"" data taking up a 16 GB phone.

**And *no*, *NOTHING* has fixed it.**  There have only been alleviations -- no cures (like cancer).  

* First, the ""obvious"" (or at least the most common) recommendation *HAS* been for me to **restore my phone** (notice the usage of ""HAS,"" as I've posted this before and still haven't gotten it to work).  Again, this does not *cure* the problem -- it only *alleviates* it (with my iPhone 4 *16 GB*, I would have about 3-4 GB of ""OTHER"" data and then restore it.... which still comes back with 0.8-1.1 GB of data, which is huge on a 16GB phone).  I would have to do this once every 2-3 months or so.

**Here is where I draw the line (!!!!)**:  The other night, **37.7GB of ""OTHER"" data took up my 128 GB.**

This is ridiculous and testing my sanity.  Honestly, I was ready to just ""eat"" the 3-4 GB of ""OTHER"" data on my new 128 GB phone, but now it's 38 GB.

**WHAT IS GOING ON**

Here's what I do with my phone:

* Call/text
* Stream HBO GO and Hulu Plus
* iTunes
* Browse websites

That's it.  The only video game I've played is The Walking Dead.  I don't even *stream music*.  

**HOW DO I FIX IT?**

**TL;DR -- The ""OTHER"" data tumor is not only transferable from phone to new phone, but it's growing exponentially.  My new 128GB iPhone just showed 38 GB of WORTHLESS ""OTHER"" data.**

**EDIT** [Here's a requested screenshot of my iPhone.  The ""OTHER"" data is at a little over 2.0 GB, after it started at 0.8 GB just 24 hours ago.  This screenshot was taken around 2AM PST.  I'll update with another screenshot maybe in a day or two to see if the ""OTHER"" data grows.](http://i.imgur.com/5J7OxWW.jpg).  If it's anything like before, it's just going to keep getting bigger, and I'm going to have to restore my iPhone in a few weeks again, and wash, rinse, repeat.  2.0GB of mysterious data is already rather large -- that's a 2.5 hour movie or about 200 songs, yet it keeps growing and I can't find it.

**EDIT 2** - It is not the text messages, since ""OTHER"" data appears despite the fact that I'd restore it to factory settings (and not a backup), and there would be ZERO text messages (or apps, videos, songs, etc.).

**EDIT 3** - It cannot be fixed or even diagnosed through ""USAGE.""  Right now, I have 2.05 GB of ""Other"" data.  I JUST restored my iPhone a day ago.  I've been streaming HBO GO for a few hours to watch a few shows, and **you know how much data HBO has used?  44 *MB*.**  (Yes, *usage*.  The app itself is about 36 MB.)  Yes, 44 megabytes.  And that's after streaming a one-hour episode of The Newsroom and 3 episodes of Game of Thrones -- so, 4 hours of streaming.   

**EDIT 4** -- [Here's a screenshot of the **""Usage""** screen](http://i.imgur.com/yrHU7AE.jpg).  I've cut out about 2 more pages of apps, but for obvious reasons, I didn't include them (their sizes -- 30 MB and below -- are insignificant compared to a 120 GB of capacity).   Notice that I have used 109 GB of my capacity, with 4.9 GB available (btw, does it annoy anyone that a 128 GB phone gives you 115 GB of *actual capacity*?  Sure, the phone must leave room for its own software/data/documents -- but 13 GB worth?)  **If you added up all the data from all the apps listed, do you think it would approach 109 GB?  Simple math says NO.**  Videos take up 94.7 GB, music takes up 3.4 GB, and 5 games between 700MB and 1.2 GB -- that adds up to 103 GB.   With 109 GB taken overall, that leaves 6 GB of ""taken"" capacity.  How do the remaining apps add up to 6 GB?

apple,Thunderbolt Display firmware 1.2 revived my old display.,"About 8 months ago, I bought a Thunderbolt Display for dirt cheap.  The issue was that the backlight stopped working.  When I brought it home, I decided to hook it up to see exactly what the issue was.  To my surprise, it worked!  I was thrilled, until my computer went to sleep, and the display never worked again.  I tore it apart to see if I could find anything obvious, tested some test points on the logic board, everything looked good.  Decided to change the T-Conn, which was impossible to find.  After finally finding one from a 2011 27"" iMac, I realized the LVDS cable connector was the wrong width. 

It sat until three days ago, when my working TBD received an update.  Out of curiosity, I found all the parts to the old display, rigged it together so it would function and installed the firmware.  I am currently using the display now, it works great!

apple,"13"" Pro Retina or 13"" Air for a first-time Apple user?","Hello! I recently started needing a more portable computer experience, and got a Dell Venue 11 Pro + keyboard dock. Long story short, I realised that the whole hybrid experience is not what I'm after, I just need a laptop.
I've been using nothing but Windows my whole life, and I figured why not try something else, I don't use computers for the same purpose as I did before, and I think that a Mac could suit my needs.

This is where I'm torn. If I get an Air it will be the 128gb 13"" model with 8gb ram, and if I get a Pro it'll be the 128gb 13"" retina version. They're both similar-ish in price, and the pro is even smaller and only a smidge heavier.

I'm curious, to those of you who have tried the machines, is the extra performence, lower battery life, feel, extra I/O, etc, etc worth the £100++ pricetag?

I intend to use the computer for Skype, web browsing, WoW and school in the future. Since it's so expensive I need it to be future-proof too.

Sorry if this is a messy post, and thanks in advance for your answers!

P.S: Would be cool if I got some suggestions before the 1st of December since some of the profits will then go to the AIDS fund :)

**EDIT:** Alright, you guys seem to be 90% Pro and 10% Air. I looked around for a bit to see if they were cheaper anywhere else, and I found a Macbook Pro 13"" 128GB for £820, and I'm having trouble identifying what model it is. If anyone here could help and tell me if it's a good deal then that would be much appreciated ^^
The model number is MGX72H/A if that tells anyone anything :3 The specs listed are as follows:

* 13"" 2560x1600
* Intel® Core™ i5-4278U
* 8 GB RAM
* 128 GB SSD
* Intel® Iris™ Graphics 5100
* 9 hours battery life

apple,"PSA: Don't use ispillrepair.com! If your Mac is liquid damaged, just take it to the Apple store, even if it costs more!","I don't know how popular this service is exactly, but I want to make sure that you don't fall into the same situation that I have.

I'm a college student who works part-time as a waiter, so I don't really have very much money, even for emergency situations. So when I accidentally spilled coffee on my beloved 13"" Retina Macbook Pro in class, understandably I was pretty worried about my ability to pay for the repair/replacement. After some research online, I managed to figure out that bringing it to the Apple store would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $8-900, which would pretty handily wipe out a significant chunk of my savings. One service, however, seemed to be a pretty good option for someone in my situation. Ispillrepair.com promises cheap repairs (starting at $350!) and a 1-year warranty. 

I called the number listed on the website and was able to get in touch with a real, human customer service rep (good sign), who told me that most repairs take between 1-2 weeks, with 15 business days being the absolute upper end. I was convinced. I sent in my laptop and a few days later received my quote for a $600 repair. Not really the kind of savings I was expecting but they already had the computer and a couple hundred bucks is a couple hundred bucks.

Two and a half weeks later after not hearing anything from the company, I call in and ask what's going on with my computer. I'm told that it has not been 15 business days and I cannot reasonably expect an update that my computer has entered ""final testing"" until that period. The customer service rep also tells me a manager will be in contact with me to make sure my experience is good. I wait until 15 business days has passed: nothing. 20 business days: nothing. 

At 23 business days in I call again, upset. This time I'm told that there is some sort of problem with my computer and that they will just replace the logic board for no extra cost and it should ship out within a week. (Why are they just making this decision now, on the phone with me? Has my computer just been sitting there waiting for them to remember they have to fix it?)

8 days later I have heard nothing. I call and talk to a customer service rep who tells me there is no manager or even service tech available. I tell her that I will be disputing the charge with my credit card company and I expect the computer back next week, fixed. I tell her this verbatim. The next business day no one gets in touch with me. I call and finally talk to a manager, who tells me they've been having a lot of trouble with my computer and are going to send it to Apple for them to refurbish at no extra cost to me. This should take ""3-5 business days"" and I will be contacted on Friday by phone AND email. This conversation I recorded and I made sure to say the exact date over the phone to the manager.

One week later, I still had heard nothing. I call again, and am told that Apple has not sent the computer back yet, and it should be back the next day. Unsurprisingly, the next day I hear nothing.

It has been another week (over two months total) and my computer is still in repair-limbo with a company that refuses to communicate with me of their own accord. I have been doing term papers for college all semester on a first-generation iPad mini that I am lucky enough to own. This company is rude, uncommunicative and misrepresents their services. I am doubtful at this point if I will ever get my computer back at all. This is a PSA to all Mac owners - the Apple store is expensive but they are accountable and fast! Just go there, ispillrepair is a scam!

TL;DR: Sent my liquid-damaged Mac to ispillrepair.com to save money, over two months later they have slipped multiple self-imposed deadlines and may have stolen my computer and charged me $600 for it. 

EDIT: the owner of the company has responded in the comments with a description of the repair process for my computer. He has also, unfortunately, paraphrased something I said on the phone in his own words but quoted it to make it appear verbatim.

apple,The downfall of Preview.,"Does anyone else think that Apple have taken what was once a great, simple, powerful app and made it an awful mess in the pursuit of, well, I don't know.

I use 10.6 Preview at work every day, saving scanned uncompressed .tiff files as well compressed .pdfs that are entirely readable and a fraction of the size. It's as simple as pressing cmd+shift+s, then saving as pdf, adding my desired quartz filter. The entire process takes a minute or two.

At home I've just tried to use 10.10 Preview to perform a similar function, and an hour later, I've managed to output a satisfactory file, but I've got no idea how I did it. I just kind of clicked options and hoped for the best.

What makes matters worse is that I can't see any real reason as to why Apple did this. Preview doesn't look appreciably different, it doesn't operate differently, they just removed 'Save As...' and made life a whole load more difficult.

:edit: Well, it seems that I'll just have to stop whining and get used to how the new Preview works.",167,215,2014-11-30,AAPL,0.04239184409379959,0.9209789633750916,0.036629222333431244
