apple,Alien Blue for Mac OS is coming soon.,"Hi all,

I've been receiving quite a few requests to develop a native Mac OS application for Reddit.  For those interested, I wanted to let you know that Alien Blue for the Mac is in development.

Although it is impossible to capture the charm of the website, Alien Blue for the Mac will give you a different way to experience Reddit.  It will be tightly integrated with your OS, and this allows me to deliver some really exciting features.

The application is a significant departure from the website, and is all about bringing convenience wrapped in a native Cocoa interface.  Design and universal accessibility will be a key focus.

The Mac client will be a complete rewrite and shares almost no common code with Alien Blue (iPhone) or Alien Blue HD, so this is taking a bit of time to put together.

The iOS clients are undergoing a UI revamp at the moment, and I'm very lucky to carry this experience over to the Mac version.  My goal will be to deliver an intuitive, responsive and attractive interface as early as possible.

In the past, I have said that the website can't be beat.  Although I stand by this statement, I am excited at the prospect of moving the redditing experience outside the browser sandbox and make it work natively with the rest of your Mac.

I will keep you posted with screenshots and videos along the way.

Thanks everyone for your support and ongoing encouragement. :)

iphone,"Hey Reddit, Whatcha Playin'?","I recently got Gunstar Heroes, Hotel Dash, Rock Band Reloaded and Let's Golf 2.


[Gunstar Heroes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gunstar-heroes/id404096825?mt=8) runs perfectly and controls fairly well - if you've played Sonic on the iPhone, you know what to expect. A downside is that your left thumb often covers up crucial parts of the action (even your character), so it's definitely not perfect.


[Hotel Dash](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotel-dash/id397836467?mt=8) is awesome. It's a portrait-mode real-time... er... hotel simulator? It's one of those management games (I'd assume, since I've never played one before) where you guide around your character, essentially checking people in and out, bringing them meals, blankets, etc. Honestly, I'm not making it sound very fun, but it's still pretty awesome.


[Rock Band Reloaded](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rock-band-reloaded/id392026754?mt=8) is fantastic, if you dig that sort of game. It's in landscape mode, as opposed to the original, which was in portrait. Visuals are nice (I can't really tell if it has retina support, but I want to say that it does - although some of the art assets are clearly not in high-res format). You get something like 15 songs, and there are a few free DLC packs you can grab, as well. Best of all, it has REAL vocal support. (Finally a game to play while driving?  ...Probably a bad idea.)


I picked up [Let's Golf 2](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lets-golf-2/id377951109?mt=8) during a Gameloft sale for 99 cents. Hoping for a decent Mario Golf clone, that's pretty much what I got. Unfortunately, that's all it is - decent. The timing gauge you use to determine power and accuracy moves way too slow, and the game is pretty much just far too easy. Too much control, it seems. Regardless, if it ever drops back down to 99 cents, I'd grab it. For $5? Pass.

[Latitudie](http://itunes.apple.com/app/latitudie/id373706743?mt=8) is a Google Latitudie client for iOS, with support for tracking your friends as well as background updates. It's entirely written by me and, while it's still unfinished (there are some aspects I still want to polish), it has received really positive reviews from lots of blogs and many people buy it every day. I've posted promo codes for this app multiple times here and they've always been used pretty quickly, so I thought you might appreciate some more, specially non-US redittors which couldn't previously use the codes.

With that said, just a couple of things more:

- Leave a comment when you use a promo code, so other redittors won't need to try them all
- If you like the app, leave a review, that will really make a difference

Enjoy!

iphone,Anyone remember Megalomania? We made an iphone clone - Twisted Time!,"Hi everyone.

My brother and I have spent the last year or so working on and off on our strategy game and would love to get your feedback on it.

For those of you who havent played Magalomania from the glory days of the Amiga, its one of the first RTS games (From before C&amp;C) and is/was pretty awesome.

In Twisted Time you build and control an army across 25 levels of changing scenery and danger and much like the game of its inspiration, you rapidly upgrade your army from sticks and stones to bows and arrows to laser Gatling guns. 

We've created a custom control scheme that actually works for strategy games on the iDevices, and allows you to quickly allocate your forces to different areas with a quick swipe of the finger (I'm actually pretty proud of this feature, I think a lot of developers ignore the interface and don't spend long enough making a viable solution for touch devices)

Anyways, heres the itunes site: [Twisted Time] (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twisted-time/id401665306?mt=8)

Heres the (admittedly pretty basic) web page on our site: [Burnt Ideas] (http://www.burntideas.com/twistedtime)

We would love to get your feedback on the game, so I'll drop a few promo codes below for those of you who cant/dont want to afford the 99cents entry fee :-)

iphone,Hi Reddit!  Today is the last day to get my game Rogue Runner for free.  Please help me get i to the top 50!,"Last thursday I made my game [Rogue Runner](http://www.stromcode.com/roguerunner.php) free and it pretty much shot up the charts, from app store hell to the top 10 in arcade AND action games.

Today is the 4th and final day I'm leaving it free, so I'm literally begging anyone and everyone to download it.  It's a really great game that I put untold hours into, and we update it with scary frequency.  Next week the next big update is coming out, which adds a bunch of new vehicles and locations, including Santa Claus in time for Christmas.

Almost 60,000 downloads in the last 3 days.  My goals were to hit 100,000 and top 50.  I hit 60,000 and #67 in three days.  Not bad!

I'd also love to hear what Reddit thinks of the game.  People seem to really like it, and respond well to our massive (and free - no IAP) content updates.

[Here is TouchArcade's writeup of the game](http://toucharcade.com/2010/11/26/rogue-runner/).  Thank you!

[edit] For an example of how big our updates are, [here is a preview of the next one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5xMjFXLCRI).  That's version 1.6, the huge holiday update that lets you play as Santa Claus and a ton of other characters.

[edit] This is also the last day to get [Geared](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geared/id325793558?mt=8) free as well, so while you're getting free games, get Geared as well.

[edit] Gonna watch Dexter then go to sleep.  Leaving Rogue Runner free until I wake up tomorrow, so download away!  

[final edit] Ok sale is over!  Thank you everyone!  I came really, really close to my goal.  #64 peak in all apps, #34 in games.  Not bad!  There were something like 80,000 downloads in 4 days.  Crazy!

As a final announcement, the 1.6 holiday update is now in review, so those of you who have the game will be able to hit the Siberian tundra as Santa Claus, guns blazing, before Christmas :)  Thanks again, everyone!",50,81,2010-12-12,AAPL,0.024099893867969513,0.9152703285217285,0.060629844665527344

We've narrowed it down to one of the higher end 13"" Macbook pros (2.66 ghz) vs. one of the 13"" Macbook Air (1.86 ghz).  

Now I'm stuck - almost all the specs are the same from here on out.  I see the processor speed as kind of an issue, but she doesn't do any gaming / much video editing, and she'll be in a political science program (so not too much intensive work computer work.  

So - slower processor, no optical drive, but super light weight vs. adding in those features but heavier to carry.  This will be her primary computer, so I kind of like the Pro route, but she also travels extensively and will be back and forth to class quite a bit - weight matters.

In the last 3 years, I've seen some great advice from the community - can you all help me make somebody special happy with some advice this time?  

EDIT:  Hey, thanks so much everybody!  So, based on comments and upvotes, it looks like the Air is the consensus.  I just got back from the Mac store (issue with my own standard white Macbook) and you wouldn't believe how much more knowledgeable you all are than their holiday help.  R/apple, you rule - have an upvotes for everyone.  Also, if you ever need any advice on dishwashers, laundry, or other appliances, give me a holler.

apple,Mac The Ripper - Beware!,"This is a warning to anyone looking for a DVD / Blu-Ray ripper for the Macintosh: The people involved with developing Mac The Ripper are insular and rude. Further, the process by which one obtains the program is poorly documented, ambiguous in detail, and overly baroque - taking days to a week to finalize. Finally, I have since learned that the authors are using GPL'd code while demanding a ""donation"" and yet not offering source per the GPL licensing requirements. 

Here are some details on the process: 

- Go to the Mac The Ripper forum and email the developer asking for instructions on how to obtain the program. 

- He emails you a paypal address to ""donate"" $40. 

- After receiving the paypal confirmation email, he will then email a copy of the binary. 

- When launching the binary it will then automatically launch mail.app and email an activation code back to the developers. The instructions say that after this point they will email back a license key to launch the app. 

I ran into a problem whereby the developer wasn't convinced that I had paid, even though I had just sent the money only days before. This led to an escalating flame war where he started by saying that I was too stupid to follow ""basic"" directions, while I replied that a ""basic"" process involved dealing with a legitimate firm that handled credit card transactions like any other normal business. From that point onward, the flamewar only got worse. I wound up giving the asshole $40 and getting basically nothing in return. 

There are many commercial DVD rippers on the market now. They run like normal businesses. I could list a few, but then readers might think I'm pimping a product instead of warning the userbase. A simple google search will show many products all of which cost less than the suggested ""donation"" for Mac The Ripper, and even a free software based solution if you're comfortable with a command line shell.

Given the horrible abuse meted out by this individual, I simply can't recommend Mac The Ripper to anyone. That guy is nuts.

[Here's a review](http://www.next-gen.biz/features/game-dev-story-review) if you don't know about it yet. It's a game where... you make games (you're the president of a game studio).

This game is just too good. I've just seen it over on /r/Android and, being curious, searched it on App Store. I can say this is the most well-spent money I've spent on the App Store. I've never reviewed apps before but just had to go back on the App Store after hours of play (it's 01:29 AM now) to give it a 5 stars. It deserves it, and I can't wait for [the sequel](http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/30/game-dev-story-2-coming-to-iphone-eventually/).

I'm on Y16 with upgraded office for 8 people. Is there another upgrade after this one? I've never went past $100,000K capital so I'm guessing that's the mark I need to get to, but last time I got up to $50,000K-ish I *had* to cash out $40M for the ""Playstatus 2"" licence (Playstatus was going obsolete by that time).

Also, it offers me the possibility to develop my own console (how cool is that!) but I have never come across the rare species of *hardware engineer* (gasp, they're like COBOL developers or what?)! How do you hire a hardware engineer?

You play Knowsy with your friends and family to see how much you know about each other. The game is simple enough that you can play it with anyone.

Game play consists of rounds, with each player selecting topics like favorite Zombie Celebrities, Favorite iPad Games or Favorite Movie Genres and ordering their top five picks, so that the other players can guess their favorites. The player who knows their friends and family best—that is, guesses the best--wins. Knowsy has predefined topics (and we try to add a new one every couple of days), but you can also create your own topics.
 
We are small 6 person bootstrapped startup—no fancy VC funding folks—who are just trying to keep ourselves in the game, creating new games and spreading the word on how serious games can help people do real work. We’d love to get some feedback from people playing Knowsy—especially ideas on how we can improve it—we are working on an iPhone/browser/other platforms version. The app is free from today to December 22; hopefully you can download and play it!

You can get it from [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/knowsy/id398269760?mt=8#) or check our simple [landing page website](http://knowsygame.com), or just search for ""Knowsy"" on the ipad app store.

apple,New step in ripping TV shows to iTunes: Maybe this will save you some frustration.,"I updated iTunes (for Mac), and my iOS to the latest version, then ripped the first season of ""Code Monkeys"" using HandBrake. When I added them to iTunes and synced them, the show wouldn't show up on the TV show list on my iPhone. I had to search for the episodes to play them. After few futile minutes of looking for a solution via google, I found a new tag field on iTunes file properties labelled ""Sort Show"". When that field is filled out, the show appears on the TV show listing on my phone. I'm guessing during one of the earlier updates this field was added, and the field was automatically copied from the ""Show"" field. New rips must be tagged under ""Show"" and ""Sort Show"".

Final edit:  I didn't realize this post would explode.  I posted it in apple for other apple users and it went to front page immediately.  This, of course, has caused a pissing match between apple and PC users that was never the point.  The original point was/is, I have zero complaints about this laptop and that, in itself, is saying something.  I'm not an easy person to please, just ask my wife and kids.

So far the things I absolutely love:

 * Speed of installation of apps.  The download takes longer than the actual install.  Windows users, you have to be fucking honest on this one, do you enjoy installing an app for 20-30 minutes along with 1-2 reboots?

Installed Firefox, but print selection also printed the page borders and the URL, despite not being selected; it's a waste of colour ink.

iphone,Hey boys and girls: Wanna do something nice for starving iPhone developers these holidays?  Please read.,"Ok this might be a stupid idea, but I think it's worth a try.

If you're an indie developer who can barely pay the bills every month, **post a link to your game or app in the comments section.**  You are also encouraged to share your story as well.


I'll pick five apps I like from the list and purchase them.  My budget is $10 (I only have $26 in the bank - no kidding, I can prove it).  So, please do the same:


**Redditors (developers or not), please pick five apps you like from the comments section and purchase them.**


This is more about helping people than to be entertained.  So if you think the app is crap, instead of asking for a refund, I invite you to leave sound, constructive feedback to devs here.  Who knows, sometimes the app store contain true gems that go unnoticed because not everyone has the skills or resources to promote their work.


To start things off, I'll post my app and my story in the comments.  Happy holidays everyone, and thank you for giving this a shot!


Addenum:  Just so you don't think I'm some sort of opportunist, I'll use half of any money I get to keep buying indie apps, donate to charities or contribute to open source projects.


**EDIT:** Whoa guys, thanks, you're phenomenal!

To devs, please keep posting your apps.  I'll soon do my part and purchase the five I promised, if not more.

**EDIT 2:** There's quite a few gems in this thread.  I'm kind of embarrassed because my game is indeed coming last when it comes to graphics.  This inspires me to do better in future projects.  Devs, please keep those apps coming.  And guys, please keep helping.  A big thanks for such a wonderful response!",105,44,2010-12-24,AAPL,0.025431102141737938,0.9271949529647827,0.04737391695380211

I now have a security camera system that sends text messages when a human is detected in the scene.  At the end of every day I turn on the system and a flurry of texts should arrive at my phone with pics of me leaving.  **these texts routinely arrive over the next several hours.**  Not only does this keep me awake all night with false alarms, it also tells me that **if there was a real intruder I would not be warned until it was too damn late.**

ATT techs tell me that everything on their end is working fine and they don't want to hear any more whining about this.  It is true that when ATT sends a test message it arrives immediately.

I set the security cameras to copy these text messages to my gmail.  Gmail gets every text message within seconds.  Since Road Runner (my ISP) and ATT must peer directly, there is no way these messages arrive at gmail OK but not ATT.  The holdup has got to be ATT, right?

DAE have this problem?  Any suggestions?",29,13,2010-12-28,AAPL,0.06899119168519974,0.9048385620117188,0.026170263066887856

iphone,"In your opinion, what is the most under-appreciated app in the AppStore, based on how cool or useful it actually is to you?","Finding a hidden gem in the app store is always so rewarding - I had this happen recently with an app called TimeTuner. It actually took me a while to find it in the app store.  I was looking for a nightstand clock radio replacement - but 99% of the apps that said you can sleep or wake to music was based off of your iPod MP3s/AACs. Of the apps that were actual streaming radio tuners, all universally sucked as alarm clocks.

Then after searching through pages and pages of apps I finally stumbled across TimeTuner. Beautiful interface, great alarm and sleep functions, and you can wake to tones or any streaming radio station you want (I have the local news, talk, weather station as my weekday alarm station, and WWOZ jazz in New Orleans for weekends). The app is even smart enough to recognize that if you have a problem streaming (maybe your Internet connection is on the blink) it will fall back to a tone so that you don't miss an alarm.

Highly underrated app, IMO. I ditched my clock radio months ago, and solely use this now both at home and when I travel.

Any under-appreciated gems you can think of?",155,104,2010-12-29,AAPL,0.022035783156752586,0.9365482330322266,0.04141602665185928

apple,iPhone video conversion droplet [mac only ATM],"(this is a repost, my last one was mangled by accident)

DOWNLOAD HERE: [http://filevo.com/7qo2zrow13jn.html](http://filevo.com/7qo2zrow13jn.html)


My sister is ""computer challenged"" and asked me to show her how to convert her video files so she could load them on her new ipod touch.

Rather than make her memorize a workflow I wrote an applescript + python applet that will use HandBrakeCLI to convert almost any video file that is dropped on it into an iphone friendly format. The new iphone video files will be placed in a folder in the same location as the script. It will skip files that have already been converted so you can keep dropping your movie folder onto the script without having to waste time reconverting files that you've already done.

The script will accept files or folders or both, and will search folders recursively to find video files to convert. Because the script uses HandBrakeCLI it will take almost anything you throw at it, including dvd's.

If you don't have the HandBrakeCLI installed as a system command, the script can download and install it for you.

This is my first script or app that I've ever released into the wild, so feedback is much appreciated.

here is a github project if you wanna edit update or convert my script: [github project](https://github.com/Laharah/convert-for-iphone--video-)

EDIT: updated download, left the script out of the applet like a tard *facePalm*

EDIT2: For people asking for versions of this script for iPhone4/iPod Touch4g, iPad, Apple TV, Apple TV 2:
I've now made a zip file containing versions of this script for each of the above formats + the original iPhone and iPod Touch, they'll all play nice with each other and you can use whichever you like :D

EDIT3: as fmurell pointed out, the conversion was not behaving correctly, the download has been updated to convert correctly
