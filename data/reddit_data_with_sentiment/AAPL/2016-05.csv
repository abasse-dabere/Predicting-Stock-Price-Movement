apple,Apple Genius Bar Technician Comes Through Huge!,"So 3 weeks ago I purchased my first desktop mac.  I opted for the 27 Inch Retina 5k.  Last night around 2 AM I heard a loud bang and our cat running from my computer room area.  My wife went to see what happened to find our new iMac tipped over with the screen shattered.  So I called Apple care this morning, they said to bring it into the genius bar to have the damage evaluated and get a repair estimate and schedule a screen replacement (The 5k's glass and screen are one so no replacing just the glass anymore). 

So I check in at the Genius Bar and show the tech my computer.  He pulls up the info and Apple Care doesn't cover damage so I'm looking at about a $600 repair.  He looks at my account and sees that I've only had this for 3 weeks.  He asks me to wait a minute to see what he can do.  He comes back 5 minutes later and tell me that he is going to accept the iMac as a damaged return and replace the entire system at no cost.  So a little bit of data migration and I'm back on my computer as if it didn't happen.

Thank you Genius Bar Tech! I don't want to put your name or location in case what you did wasn't entirely allowed!",315,1508,2016-05-01,AAPL,0.13681918382644653,0.8291187286376953,0.03406210616230965

iphone,Imgur for mobile web has become a complete joke,"Since a while ago it's no longer possible to directly link to imgur pictures. Even i.imgur.com links loads up the full mobile page. 

I guess the mobile page is pretty quick but there's one major problem: *only the low resolution image is shown*, it's impossible to view the details of the original image in the browser. 

I was looking at this image from /r/hearthstone today (10,000 wins in arena is insane btw kudos):

http://i.imgur.com/vLzNojv.jpg 

When I realized just how ridiculously low-res it is. To illustrate here's what it looks like when I tried pinch to zoom in safari:

http://i.imgbox.com/hAY9LD25.png

And here's what the image is supposed to look like:

http://i.imgbox.com/QBZp0eVy.png

Note how I didn't use imgur in above examples since important details would be lost if viewed in mobile. 

I'm not 100% against showing the full web page every time. I understand that imgur has bills to pay and allowing hotlinking images is expensive for them. However, the resolution loss is ridiculous especially considering that most of imgur's mobile page visitors are using high DPI devices like any iPhone since the 4. 

I feel like there must be a way for the high resolution image to be shown within the mobile web page. There's a comprise here that can happen.",28,205,2016-05-01,AAPL,0.07916459441184998,0.8836276531219482,0.03720768913626671

It's so unnecessarily convoluted already with me having to download a 3rd party application to be able to access web downloads and file systems, but the fact that my computing tablet is still handicapped by iTunes is ridiculous.

apple,Please Apple - An open appeal for a tower,"Seven years ago Mac Pro towers were magnificent beasts. Fast, upgradeable, convenient, and even beautiful to look at. Creative professionals bought, used and relied on them. 

Then with each passing year, Apple let these machines languish. SATA, USB, PCIe, all lingered at slower speeds as other PCs continued to evolve. And by 2013 we'd learn that the reason for this neglect was that Thunderbolt and the new Cylinder Mac Pro would make the waiting worth it.

Well, after three years I just don't believe it.

The new Mac Pro is a solution for a problem that never existed. Few if any pros care that their machine is compact. On the contrary, being forced to string together a spaghetti junction of drives and hubs while having fewer upgrade options makes the new Mac much less desirable - even though many prefer MacOS. My creative colleagues are leaving the platform in order to achieve better performance for price. Many are migrating fully to Adobe Creative Cloud which simply runs better on a Windows PC.

For the price of a ""Darth Mac"" my colleagues can enlist the services of premium, industry-based workstation builders to make custom towers maxed out with top-of-the-line components and provide personal care should any issues arise. For 3D, video, and other GPU/CPU-hungry activities, their PCs outperform the Darth which, Apple pundits all acknowledge, is long overdue for an update.

""Apple doesn't care about pros,"" is a meme that's persisted for the past seven years as Apple has orphaned users of its servers and some professional apps (Final Cut Server, Aperture, and the hamfisted launch of FCPX which now, thankfully is a top-notch NLE, but after four years of issues). Given that a tiny fraction of Apple revenue comes from its pro creative community, perhaps they are too in love with miniaturization and aesthetics to realize that there's a huge hole in their product lineup.

It's a tower. Oculus' Palmer Luckey said they wouldn't support the Mac until Apple offered a machine with acceptable GPU specs. Circa 2012 Mac Pro Tower owners are installing 980ti and Titan video cards, an option Darth Mac users don't have. 

Pros want drive sleds, RAM slots, expansion, accessibility. They want what Jobs called a ""truck."" But a real truck. We'll buy iMacs and MBPs for out in the field. But when it comes to at-home/office high-powered computing, we need an industrial solution ... and the Darth Mac just ain't it.

This all arose because a friend in the video business is meeting with MS and a laundry list of colleagues are sharing their migration stories away from the Mac (even though, ironically many acknowledge FCPX offers many advantages to Avid/Adobe) and this concerns me as it just feels like Apple, a company that built a lot of its mojo with the support of creative professionals, is too fixated on iPhones to care.

Apple, as a company you have more money than God, and I realize that shareholders hover from quarter to quarter, but you're starving some of your most loyal users who don't care if you make a machine look like a work of art. They need all the things you offered seven years ago, but faster. That's it. Just faster.

Keep the Darth for those who want it. It's great to have an efficient, quiet and small machine. But the absence of a tower has become a declaration of indifference to those who demand it. Enough to willingly abandon the platform...",190,309,2016-05-04,AAPL,0.05822790786623955,0.9087878465652466,0.032984230667352676

But that $.99 ringtone that you thought was nice, nope, that stays on the device that you bought it from.

I am not sure what year this is and why we're still stuck in it. Yes, i know about the computer backup, restore purchases, but in my case, one who doesn't have a computer to backup my ipad in, and uses iCloud for backups, I can't imagine why Apple doesn't have a fix for this, after preaching computer independence for so long.
Apple tech gave me a credit refund so i could rebuy it on my iphone. Ridiculous. I spent an Apple Tech guy's good 1 hour (like ~$25 maybe) to investigate, communicate, fix, and follow up with me on my $.99 issue.

apple,Monthly APPreciation Thread for May 2016,"Here's this month's App recommendation thread! What apps have you been enjoying for the past month?
*****
**Guidelines**  

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.  
* **One app per comment.**
* Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS, OS X, WatchOS and TV OS are all game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a few sentences, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc) because everyone knows about those.

*****
**Last month's top five suggestions:**  

1. [Voices (Free, iOS)](http://apple.co/1TnXOhK) Voices is a tool that I made to make it easier for you to call your elected representatives. Was inspired by the SOPA protests in 2012. It uses your GPS location to show you who your representatives are and then gives you their email / twitter / phone number. The longterm goal is to let people subscribe to advocacy groups that they care about, like the EFF, and receive calls to action from the advocacy groups. Users will be able to set notification settings so they don't get spammed. Used it myself a few times during the FBI vs Apple battle. Would love to hear what you guys think - /u/hau5keeping

2. [Mango Languages (Free, iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mango-languages/id443516516?mt=8) - Mango Languages is a foreign language learning program that you can access for free through your local public library. If you have a library card, and your public library has a subscription, you can access lessons for the 70+ languages that Mango offers on its very simple and clean app. A great deal considering it would otherwise cost $20/month for individual subscriptions. The lessons are set up as if you were going to travel to a particular country and needed to get by with your standard travel-based conversation (purchasing items in a store, asking where places are, etc.), but through that you can learn all sorts of vocab and syntax to help you get started with a new language. Since marrying a Greek girl last year, I've been tasked with learning her family's language, and I had been struggling to find a program I'd want to stick with until finding Mango (I actually learned about it through my library). I find it really enjoyable to shoot through a lesson on my phone if I have a moment, and there's enough reiteration that it helps solidify newly learned phrases. I also really appreciate that it includes useful cultural notes amongst the lessons so that not only will you learn the language, you'll learn the customs (e.g., in Greece, never hail a taxi with your palm open and fingers spread apart). Thanks to Mango Languages, I can now say μιλάω λίγα Ελληνικά! -/u/senorski  

3. [Today: Habit tracker for your daily goals and routine with custom health &amp; fitness dashboards ($4.99 iPhone)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/today-habit-tracker-for-your/id1055295863?mt=8) - I've been using it to track several habits I want to keep up. Just from its use keeping track of my Drawing habit, I've gotten more of my money's worth than from any other app .-/u/Choppa790

4. [Fastfari (Free, iOS)](https://appsto.re/i6YV9Q7) - Better 3D Touch Quick Actions for Safari. The Safari app provides 4 default Quick Actions on 3D Touch capable iPhones which are not always very useful. Fastfari allows you to quickly jump to a favorite website with 3D Touch on your home screen. -/u/theappengine 

5. [Hackathons (Free, iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hackathons-search-local-global/id1099019677?mt=8&amp;ref=producthunt) - Recently I, along with my amazing colleagues, won a Google Startup Weekend event (it's basically a hackathon). After winning that hackathon I came to the realization that if one of my colleagues hadn't pointed out that this event existed, I would have never known about the event. I began to look at the Apple app store the following day to find an app that provided a comprehensive list of hackathon events with an attention to detail and great organization. Unfortunately, I couldn't find one. What I found was a pile of apps from different universities and non-profit organizations for their own hackathon events. I needed something with all events from various organizations, and so Hackathons was created. I created Hackathons in order to find local hackathon events around me and to also find events around the globe in the event that I may someday travel to participate in these wonderful events. The Hackathons app currently allows users to search local and global hackathon events, save events to their calendars, find location information, find out whether or not a particular hackathon event is free, and register for events. - /u/somnibyte

iphone,Stalker App - Your friendly personal stalker,"http://www.bigpaua.com/stalker/

So I’ve had some free time on my hands and wanted to make a new app. It’s not finished yet but it’s getting close, and I’m keen to get more people playing with it and getting some feedback. Plus I’m running out of money so I need to get a real job again soon - it’s time to finish up the pet project.

If you’d like to have a play with it and maybe provide some feedback, either tell me your email address or sign up on the app’s [super shitty website](http://www.bigpaua.com/stalker/) and I’ll send you a build!

**The General Idea**

Our iPhones know a whole lot of stuff about our everyday lives, but it’s not collected or organised in useful ways, so we don’t learn much from it or get much use out of it. Stalker’s goal is to collect that stuff, make sense of it, then present it in useful ways. 

If you’ve ever used [Moves App](https://www.moves-app.com) you’ll be familiar with the basic idea. Moves has long been one of my favourite apps and is one of the main inspirations for Stalker. But while Moves is great, I wanted to go much deeper, with more detail and more insights. 

**What Stalker Can Do**

So far I’ve been working on nailing the core functionality. But I have been distracted by a few “ooh that’d be cool” ideas, so it does a few extra things.

**The Basics**

- **It automatically records all of your walks, runs, bike rides, car trips, train trips, flights, etc.** It then puts them on a map, and tells you useful things about them.

 If you go for a jog in the park you don’t have to press any start or stop buttons or even open the app. It’ll automatically know when you’re jogging and properly record it.

- **It automatically records the places you’ve been**, and tells you useful things about your visits to those places, and over time will start telling you useful things about the places themselves, like how many times you’ve been there, what hours of the day you’re most likely to be there, etc. [note: Over the first few days it’ll make some dumb guesses about which places you were at. But if you correct it it’ll learn and improve its accuracy over time].

**Photos**

- **It automatically knows what photos you took while at a place** (or photos you took while travelling between places), and tidily groups them together for you.

 So let’s say you took a bunch of photos with your friends at a bar a few weeks ago and want to show them to someone. You can flick through your Stalker history, find the bar’s timeline entry, tap on it, and voila, there’s all the photos you took at the bar. Personally I use this for food photos at cafes, because food photos are important. 

 Much easier than trying to scroll back through your entire photo library to find things without context. 

- **It can add correct location data to photos that don’t have it.**

 Let’s say you own a fancy big camera and take lots of photos with it. You import them into Photos and they sync to iCloud Photo Library. Now the photos are available on all your devices. Awesome. We’re living in the future. Except your fancy big camera doesn’t have GPS, so the photos don’t neatly show up on a map and don’t appear in Photos location search results. Boo. Not the future. 

 But if you then open the photos in Stalker you can tap a little button on them and Stalker will add proper location data, making everything better. Great for all those hundreds of unorganised vacation photos.

**Flying, Hiking, Hot Air Balloons**

- It keeps track of the altitude of every location data point, and if it thinks it’s worth doing for a specific trip, it’ll make a pretty altitudes graph for you. 

 That means if you go hiking over some massive hill, it’ll produce a graph showing the ups and downs of your hike. Along with telling you how many miles / kilometres you walked, your average walking speed, how many steps you took, and all that other basic stuff. 

 Or let’s say you took a one hour flight between cities. You’ll be able to see exactly how much time of that hour was spent just going up then back down again *[spoiler: It’s pretty much 30 minutes going up, 30 minutes going down. But it’s still fun to see a graph of it]*.

**Calories, Heart Rate, Health Stuff**

- If you’re wearing an Apple Watch or some other HealthKit connected device, Stalker will record how many calories you burnt while at each place and on the paths between places. Like how many calories you burnt at the gym, or while jogging in the mark.

 It will also record your average heart rate for each history item (ie a visit to a place, or a path between places). So you can see what your average heart rate was while at the gym, while cycling or walking home from the gym, that sort of thing. 

**The Name**

Yeah it’s a kind of weird app name. I was running out of ideas and just went with it because it’s sorta ironic funny. If you’ve got a better app name idea, I’m all ears!

**Privacy**

Stalker is not an attempt to collect and sell your data. Your data is stored securely in your private Apple CloudKit container, only accessible by you. I don’t have any desire or plans to collect and use people’s personal data, and the app is specifically designed to make nasty privacy invasive things difficult to do. Nothing it records will be visible to anyone else other than you.

While syncing it, I discovered that it was named ""Buddy."" I will now refer to Buddy by his real name from now on. Fearing that I may have overpaid, I looked up Buddy on eBay. Buddy is selling for $60, holy cow! At this point I was extremely content with myself. After watching a keynote on seeing Buddy introduced to the world, I did a Google to see how long Buddy's battery would last because I have a portable battery.

That's weird, Buddy had a battery recall in 2005. That's also weird, they're still accepting Buddy. After some more googling I found out **they give you the most updated version of the iPod Nano.** Oh my God.

TL;DR - Buddy, the ultimate bro, got me a 7th generation iPod Nano for $10.

EDIT: Apple sent me overnight shipping for the box to send Buddy back in. Also, that box also has overnight shipping. I may be getting Buddy Neo a lot faster than I expected. Travel safe, Buddy.",175,1094,2016-05-12,AAPL,0.026970384642481804,0.916478157043457,0.056551456451416016

iphone,"Hi r/iPhone. I'm donating 100% of the proceeds from Cesium sales TOMORROW, May 14 to Fort McMurray Fire relief.","Hi r/iPhone!

I'm going to donate my profits from the sale of [Cesium Music Player](https://itunes.apple.com/app/cesium-your-music-streamlined./id924491991?mt=8) TOMORROW (May 14) to the [Red Cross Alberta Fires Appeal](https://donate.redcross.ca/ea-action/action?gclid=CLn-0u-V18wCFdhahgodU9cFPA&amp;ea.client.id=1951&amp;ea.campaign.id=50639). If you've been looking for an alternate music player, tomorrow would be a great time to try one out and help a great cause.

Full transparency:

* Apple takes a 30% cut from App Sales, and I probably won't be able to afford to make up the difference. If you want to ensure that 100% of your money goes directly to Red Cross please donate directly [here](https://donate.redcross.ca/ea-action/action?gclid=CLn-0u-V18wCFdhahgodU9cFPA&amp;ea.client.id=1951&amp;ea.campaign.id=50639).
* Yes, any increased traffic around Cs will positively affect it's rating in the App Store. I'm promoting because Cs sales are the only disposable income I have to donate, and I thought that letting people know would maximize the amount I can give.

Thank you! Thank you for supporting the folks of Fort McMurray, no matter how you do it :)

Edit 1: Thanks to everyone who purchased today! Can't wait to see the sales numbers tomorrow. Will follow up.

Edit 2: Big thanks to everyone who participated. We had 64 units sold, which had a total of $134 in sales (including Apple's cut) which I've rounded up to $150. The Governments of Canada and Alberta are both matching donations, meaning we'll have a collective impact of $450.

I thought maybe some of you might like this, I recently took up an interest in home automation and was looking for affordable ways to turn your home into a smart home. Here is the video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwCukli7p0k (coffee at 0:50)



The light bulbs I bought are less than half the price of Philipps Hue, but came without HomeKit functionality. I didn't like their App, and really wanted Siri control as well. So I used a Raspberry Pi and a software called openHAB, which can create bindings to hundreds of smart home devices. So now Siri sends commands to the Pi, which in turn controls my lights, music (for scenes like Emergency Party or Instant Romance) as well as a smart socket to which I have my coffee machine connected.

I would always say how I wanted the aluminum one just because it was on the cheaper side. After her looking at them for a while she decided to get me the 42 mm black stainless steel. I'm so happy and think that it's completely worth it spending that extra cash to get the stainless steel. It looks gorgeous!

After playing around with the new Chinese Drum Kit, Pipa and Erhu I realized I can create a version of the Game of Thrones theme song in couple of minutes and I prepared a video showing how to unlock these instruments, prepare the theme song. If you like you can download the garageband files and play around yourself. The link to the files is in the description box of the video.

apple,"1 year later, how happy are you with your Apple Watch?","I ordered my Apple Watch on launch day last year and didn't receive it until May 6. I savoured the unboxing until I got home from work so that I could share it with my wife. 

The presentation, and frankly needlessly over packaged Stainless Steel watch was a joy to experience. The setup was painless and the sync animation was fun. 

Then, the months dragged on. The speed of the watch was a huge hindrance. I stopped using it for anything more than checking the time and getting SMS previews. 

With update 2.0, the speed improved. Talking to the watch and getting Siri to do my bidding was instantly better. I was using it again - it felt right. 

Then came the 6S.

For some reason, the watch is now unreliable in anything it does for me. Replying to text messages with voice just doesn't work. It's faster to pull out my phone and reply there. Asking Siri to set a reminder is hit and miss. More misses than hits lately. Viewing and replying to texts with an emoji is painfully slow, to the point where I don't do it anymore.

And that's where I stand now - my Apple Watch has tipped the balance from a useful tool, to an unreliable deadweight on my wrist. The experience has taught me that it's better to reply on my phone than it is to try the watch. 

That's a deep rooted lesson in user experience. Apple seemingly prioritized the excessive animations, 3rd party apps, and laundry list of unused features over the one feature that this type of product needs to be a true phone companion: speed. 

Apple created a product that has more polish and glam than usefulness. All the bands and watch types and packaging and luxury accessories and design videos are just lipstick on a $1000 pig.

apple,iTunes' handling of classical music recently got **way** better,"iTunes has a lot of problems, and I will be the first to complain about the bloated crapware it has become. One of the most common issues, more or less since the beginning, has been how to handle Classical music. [It may have something to do with the limited nature of MP3 tags, which were not designed for classical music.](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/the-tragedy-of-itunes-and-classical-music/399788/) But it also is just that Apple never seemed to care that much about it, [leading to a lot of hacks](http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/itunes.htm) to easily browse your music by composer, for instance putting the composer in the Artist field.

However, sometime recently Apple got their act together with classical music, and I'm not sure when. But man, is it way better. Let me count the ways:

1. Especially in the newest version of iTunes, with the redone sidebar, you can add a Composer view directly to the sidebar.
2. There is a new option for music files' metadata to ""show composer in all views."" That means that if you have a compilation album, for instance from Yo Yo Ma, you can keep it as a single album and it will show ""By Ludwig van Beethoven"" under the file, just like if you had a compilation album of pop songs by various artists and each individual artist would be displayed under each track.
3. This isn't on the desktop iTunes yet but in the iOS version of iTunes, it also respects the ""grouping"" tag to display a multi-track piece together. So if you have an album with 3 concertos, each by a different composer, and each with 3 movements, in the past you would need to put all that information in the title tag of each track, e.g. ""Tchaikovsky - Concerto in E Major - I. Allegro."" Now, on the iOS version of iTunes, it will all be under a single album but will divide them by ""grouping,"" which is a very useful place to put the name of the piece of music as a whole. Now, I still put ""Concerto in E. Major - I. Allegro"" in the title because the desktop interface hasn't caught up yet, but it may soon.

On the whole this represents a major improvement - and bodes well for the ability of Apple to improve iTunes as a whole.",63,496,2016-05-23,AAPL,0.022454148158431053,0.9255675077438354,0.05197838693857193

apple,"Apple delivered wrong item, CS not helping, urging me to call police","TLDR: Ordered MBP, got sent Apple TV. Apple CS said I will have to call police to investigate. Now my bank account has £1000 less, and I have no Macbook, but an Apple TV, sad thing is I don't have a TV.

 
&amp;nbsp;

I'm so anxious about the new toy, I tracked my package all the way from China to Korea to Khazakstan, Poland, Germany to my home. When I received it, I didn't feel any differences (which I should), when I opened it, it was an APPLE TV !!!
 
&amp;nbsp;

I immediately called Apple and explained, the man opened an investigation for me and asked me to upload as much photos as possible and send it to an email, as well as the serial number of the Apple TV.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I did as told, the next day, another guy phoned back, and said the Apple TV belonged to another person, but they can't reach him. He suspected it to be a fraud/thief, could be the UPS guy or someone else. And ask me I will have to call the police myself for investigation.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Does anybody share similar experience?

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT 1: Emailed Tim Cook with the case and more photos

EDIT 2: Had a trip to the local police station, explained the case, and showed them more pictures (including the one above). They say the evidence doesn't seem to be stealing. What I provided only points to a miss delivery from the retailer and customer. If a case has to be opened, the retailer (or me) needs to provide more details highlighting the ""thief"" part. (e.g. Device registered by some other ppl, which I don't have information, only Apple does). Police recommends me to keep contact with the retailer and sort it out. So now, Apple telling me to sort it out with the police, police telling me to sort it out with Apple.

EDIT 3: Called Apple again, senior advisor replied, saying investigation ended, no luck. Advice is to call police. Explained police wouldn't take case, and ask if I could get any information that could help going to the police, advisor said no.

EDIT 4: Filed dispute from the bank, awaiting response, could take long

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT 5: WHAT A TURNAROUND!!! An advisor called me Apple located my Macbook. He said the item was misdelivered (sent to another place) and now its heading to my local Apple store. He'll issue me a Macbook Pro return label for the Apple TV, I'll need to drop it off at a pickup point, he'll inform the department that handle orders that the content is Apple TV. * I have marked down the advisor's full name in case anything happens again.

What are some good and bad aspects of Apple hardware? What do you like and dislike?",649,318,2016-05-29,AAPL,0.03892689570784569,0.9129306077957153,0.04814254119992256

apple,Will the new Macbooks be REALLY that much faster? Geekbench makes me think it won't be a huge difference.,"I've been really tossing up whether or not to buy a current 15"" at a good price, so I checked out some Geekbench scores to get an idea.

 The current top of the line 15"" gets a score of about 14950 or so on 64 bit multi core.

 I then decided to check out a Dell XPS with a 6700k CPU in there and those score at best 15900. 

 This makes me feel that the new MBP's won't be all that much faster and the only people who will benefit at folks seeking a slighly lighter chassis or more powerful GPU.

 I was really hoping to see a bigger jump.

 The one thing that does confuse me however is that my i7 1.7ghz Macbook Air scores not far off the i7 3.1ghz (13 inch) for single core speed tests. How does that work?",90,102,2016-05-29,AAPL,0.01605379395186901,0.9152940511703491,0.06865214556455612
