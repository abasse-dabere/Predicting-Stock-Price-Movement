apple,"I'm sick of the keyboard failures on the 2018 15"" MBP.","I really want to love this machine, I really do. No issues except for this trash butterfly keyboard. The life span is literally like a butterfly's in my experience.

 Last night, my 1-week old replacement machine's keyboard has already failed, with the I key duplicating. The original machine was bought in July 2018, and the first keyboard on that lasted for 5 months, when it developed the duplicate keypress issue in December. 

Since then, I've gone through multiple top case swaps and the full MBP replacement. These keyboard issues keep happening 1-3 weeks after a repair/replacement and I do not abuse my machines. 

This is under normal home conditions, and this is 100% an issue with the switches. It's not the keycap, and it's not the silicone membrane that keeps dust out. It's the switch itself that keeps failing.

I had a 2017 MBP and it needed a replacement keyboard, and the replacement still works to this day, my friend has the machine now and has no issues except needing the keyboard cleaned every so often. 

Is anyone else really pissed off like me that they spend almost $3000 (or $2000 on a 13"" MBP) for a premium laptop and got this kind of crap quality?",259,369,2019-03-02,AAPL,0.14069662988185883,0.8233804106712341,0.035922933369874954

apple,There is something really strange and shady going on in the Apple community website.,"My posts, comments, being deleted / edited by someone, who I strongly believe is a user named Buster\_From\_Oak\_Park. 

Little background. I recently had the stage light, flexgate issue, and started posting on the apple community, section macbook pro. 

The username mentioned above, replies to everyone who has such a problem, saying that they should have bought apple care and not to complain, and that not buying apple care is foolish. But this is outrageous, as this issue is strictly a design flaw, and has nothing to do with the way the customer treats its laptop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weirdly enough, my comments get deleted as non constructive, but his stay on the forum, even though they are not constructive either, and inappropriate. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is REALLY shady, is that in a comment I pointed out that he may not be one of us -consumer- but work for apple and is strongly biased towards them. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happens next? 

&amp;#x200B;

My comment gets edited by the host, which was NOT Buster\_From\_Oak\_Park. As expected, the part in which I called him out got deleted. Can this even be done?

iphone,For any iPhone XR doubters...,"I was an iPhone XR doubter. Unfortunately, my iPhone 8 was involved in a workplace accident and was squashed by a big printer (don't ask), so I ultimately had to replace it.

I went to the Apple store and weighed my options. To fix my out of warranty iPhone 8 would've roughly been half a new device, so I decided to buy a replacement. I wasn't going to buy the year old iPhone 8 again, so it was between the iPhone XR or XS. I wasn't going to blow ¬£999 on the XS as I couldn't justify spending that much on a phone because of an accident, so I bought the XR. I was dreading the lack of 3D Touch and the dated display **for a 2018 device.**

It took some time to get used to the size and weight of the XR, but after 2 weeks of using it, I can safely say it is a fantastic device and is definitely an improvement over my iPhone 8 **in all areas.**

The only thing I miss is 3D Touch, especially 3D touching the keyboard **(I know I can long press the space bar on the XR, but it is no way near as reliable)** The display is very impressive for a sub 1080p LCD panel, and is definitely an improvement over the iPhone 8.

All in all - great device. I hope Apple work on improving 'Haptic Touch', as there are definitely a few functions of '3D Touch' that can be emulated with long touches.

*******************************************************************
*-edit- People seem to really want to know how my iPhone 8 met its maker, so here goes...*

I had to lift up one of those office desktop printers and relocate it somewhere else. This wasn't your typical HP home desktop printer though. This was one of the old school, super heavy Xerox multi-functional printers. It even has a notice on the back of it recommending 2 people lift it. Who even reads the small print?

I put my iPhone 8 (complete with case and glass screen protector) in my pocket, proceeded to pickup this anvil of a printer, and lugged it to the nearest lift. Went down a couple of floors, picked the damn thing up again, and finally got it where it needed to be.

Went back to my desk, got my phone out and it was completely smashed. Front screen &amp; home button. The home button didn't even respond anymore! Complete fluke. I luckily work near an Apple store so I took it there and even they were miffed. It must've been from how I was holding the printer? 

I had one good bit of news that day though - apparently that printer got moved again by someone else, and they couldn't do it by themselves; they had to get someone else to help them. HA!",381,1047,2019-03-05,AAPL,0.049010489135980606,0.8998068571090698,0.05118266120553017

AppleWatch,Apple Watch is great for people who are deaf!,"I was born profoundly deaf. I was fortunate enough to be implanted with a cochlear implant when I was one, so I‚Äôve developed my speech and hearing to where some people don‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm deaf. I got a second implant when I was 18, last year. The newest model of cochlear implant allows users to pair the implant to an iPhone, iPod, iPad allowing me to stream music to my implant via Bluetooth! I simply click play music on my Apple Watch and instantly stream music to my brain and nobody else can hear it. Another amazing feature is the alarm clocks. I‚Äôve tried various vibrating alarm clocks because I sleep without my implant. Some work about 75% of the time but I tend to move a lot in my sleep and it either falls out of my pocket/ off the bed or just isn‚Äôt strong enough. The apple watch vibration from the alarm works every time! Its also great because I can schedule the alarms for different times on different days and never touch it. It‚Äôs truly a miracle how far technology has come 

TLDR: My Apple Watch wakes me up because I can‚Äôt hear alarm clocks. I can also stream music directly from my phone to my cochlear implant by pressing a button on my Apple Watch",167,1163,2019-03-07,AAPL,0.026766406372189522,0.9320281744003296,0.041205354034900665

apple,WiFi Sharing between Apple devices is just perfect.,"I was at a friends house and was staying over after some drinks, I asked her for the WiFi password but she did not have it as her brother changed the password and she couldn't remember what it was set to. He was away for the weekend with no reception so she could not ask for it either.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her not to worry and to look at her phone, I clicked on the SSID to join and boom, it appears on her phone asking to share passwords. It makes life so much easier and despite iOS having some flaws, this is one of the many reasons iOS is so great.

&amp;#x200B;

To all the people asking how this works or how to do it, here is a video.

iphone,The grass wasn't greener on the other side. My brief affair with the s10+,"Since this is reddit, I need to specify that these are my own opinions and experiences. They could be completely different for someone else. Also, I realize objectively speaking, the s10+ is a great phone and lots of people love Android. That's awesome and I'm happy for those people.

As far as the s10+ goes, the hardware is decent but not great. Software is not good. I've had one since they launched and I'm actually returning it today to go back to the iPhone.

Hardware has one major issue and that is the touch implementation with the curved display. I have tons of accidental touches that make the phone almost unusable when holding it with one hand (yes I tried downloading multiple apps to fix this issue. I shouldn't have to download apps to make the phone usable though.). The sides are also not completely round or completely squared. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold. This is purely a strange thing that comes down to me as an individual but for some odd reason the s10+ feels lighter than my iPhone X. It's not...but it feels like it. I prefer the heavier more solid feel of the iPhone X. I was really looking forward to the finger print reader, but it's a let down. It works maybe 85% of the time for me and that's not really acceptable in my opinion. Also, yes I have done multiple things to improve the fp reader. Those changes did help improve it from about a 30% success rate so there's that. The screen is also nice but I personally don't see a major difference between the s10+ screen and the iPhone x screen. On the other hand I will say the headphone jack and the fast charging are amazing though. The fast charging is something I didn't know I wanted or needed. It's seriously legit.

The software (Android specifically) is great when it comes to the amount of customization that is possible. On the other hand, I don't enjoy having to download a variety of apps so I can get some of the same basic features of iOS. I also feel like the design language on iOS apps and iOS in general is much more standardized than Android and Android apps. Also, for some reason, I can't seem to type accurately at all on the keyboard. I have tons of misspelled words and there are annoyances like the first letter of a sentence not capitalizing all the time. Another issue is that sometimes touches on the screen aren't recognized. Not sure if that is hardware or software though. Also, one last thing, the scrolling on the s10+ was really bad. If I was scrolling down a webpage it was either super slow or super fast.

I'm going back to the AT&amp;T store today to return the s10+. I might get an XS and I might stick with my X, but the one thing I know is that I am sticking with Apple.

edit: I forgot to add the fact that I did also really like the hole punch camera. I like it more than the notch.",373,1055,2019-03-13,AAPL,0.04842342808842659,0.9184477925300598,0.03312881663441658

AppleWatch,Apple repair sending S2s out for older watch repairs,"I read recently that Apple were sending out Series 2s for repairs against older watches - so decided to give it a go.  My original '1st gen' Series 0 was almost 4 years old and working perfectly - except the battery was barely lasting a day now.

So I looked it up on Apple's repair website.  Would cost me ¬£62.50 + shipping + VAT (I'm in the UK) - so ¬£82.44 in total (US$108 / ‚Ç¨95) for a battery repair (replacement).  I paid on the website on Friday and they said they'd ship me a box to return it to them in.  Sure enough, the box arrived on Monday morning.  I packaged it up and dropped it off at a UPS collection point around lunchtime that day.

The package arrived back this morning (Wednesday) - less than 48hrs after I dropped it off on Monday - impressive.  Sure enough, they've sent me back a brand new Series 2.

To say I'm impressed is an understatement.  ¬£80 for replacement of a 4 year year old product with a brand new one that's 2 versions more recent?  Wow.  How to retain a customer!",138,550,2019-03-13,AAPL,0.03889688849449158,0.8917552828788757,0.0693478137254715

apple,"7 Repairs, 1 Macbook Pro, Apple sent back a broken Macbook","Friends, I am having to get my Macbook Pro serviced again.

My Macbook has needed repair 7 times so far. On this most recent repair, I told my representative, I wanted either a loaner or a replacement. I was told I couldn't have either.

There are 4 parts of the Macbook Pro. The screen. The top case. The bottom case. The logic board.

I sent it in for repair number 6, with a note included with the Macbook, with a list of problems that need to be fixed. One of those problems on the list was GPU death. The GPU is dying. It is causing problems in my day to day use of the computer. Apple sent it back, and replaced the screen, the top case, and the bottom case, but not the logic board.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to point out that after this upcoming repair, i wont have a single original part from before the last repair. I was told ""no replacement"". So Apple will replace all 4 parts, and waste 2 weeks of my time, but Apple won't give me a replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the Apple representative on my case, called me back after my Macbook returned, and instead of giving me a resolution, she told me I had to prove it. I had to prove the GPU death. She had another advisor call me and had me run a diagnostic tool on the computer. I very very easily captured these logs with Apple's tool, and we proved GPU death. Well, now she's on vacation. For a whole week. Nobody else able to take over my case. I feel like she called me a liar, then left on vacation. My Macbook is crashing. Videos won't finish playing without the GPU restarting itself/crashing.

&amp;#x200B;

This is Apple top tier customer service. I'm ready for the downvotes. 7 repairs, 1 student, I just want a working computer. I don't mistreat my device. It dies every 3-6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: a lot of people here seem to really like Rossmann Repair Group. I'm going to link their YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw\_ELax4Yisf6w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w)

He exposes a lot of the anti consumer practices Apple is guilty of. He also educates people on component level repair. I highly recommend. He also does Twitch streams, and he has an active Discord community.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: I decided to call Apple and ask to speak with Customer Relations. The senior advisor on the phone refused to transfer me to customer relations because my rep ""owns my case"" and told me that this is out of the scope of customer relations. I was hung up on.

Edit 3: I've decided to leave a voicemail for Tara Bunch

Edit 4: I'm still trying to get to customer relations or executive relations. I got hung up on once again already, and I'm calling for a 3rd time.

Edit 5: One of my senior advisors I got on the phone read this thread

Edit 6: The senior advisor called me back. He tried to call the apple stores to ask if I could have a loaner. They told him no, and that there was no way to track it or something. They keep suggesting I buy a 2nd one, to return after a few weeks.

Edit 7: The senior advisor was the nicest person I've gotten on the phone all day. They told me they emailed executive relations, and that they have acknowledged the email and said they would ""handle it appropriately""

Edit 8: I received a call back from Executive Relations, and they told me that I have to wait until Monday for the other agent to return from vacation. They told me that there will be no loaner device provided to me. They told me that there is no way to get around having to wait 9 days while my agent was on vacation. I asked the executive relations agent to let me talk to their boss, or talk to another agent, and they told me no. I asked for her to send me an email summarizing the conversation we had over the phone. She told me no. She refused to document this in any form of writing. I asked her if I was free to call back and record the conversation, and her response was that they do not consent to call recordings. A bunch of thieves if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 9: It's Sunday now, and the J key on my keyboard has started to not go down all the way, it's mushy now. These keyboards are junk.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 10: It's the next week now, and we're sending it in for repair number 7. No loaner device. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason a lot of you guys seem to think my computer is out of warranty, or that it has ever been out of warranty during any of these repairs, and that is not true. My computer has been in warranty the entire time.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you guys seem to think that Apple has no legal obligations to make sure I have a working computer after I purchased one, with a warranty attached. My replacement I got after the 4th repair is also still defective and therefore is not a resolution to my problem. I'd like to link this here for you guys to read up on. It's called the Magnusson Moss Warranty Act, and is one of the consumer protection laws regarding warranties and repairs [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter50&amp;edition=prelim](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter50&amp;edition=prelim)

&amp;#x200B;

Another law I'd like to put here applies to citizens of California. I was residing in California when I received my computer, and still have a residence in California. I'm not sure if I would have much luck pursuing anything with California laws, but for those who are unaware; a computer like this, should have 7 years of warranty and repairs according to the state of California. It states everything with a wholesale price of $100 or higher is required to have 7 years of service, repair, and availability of working parts. I learned about this law when I worked for AppleCare.

apple,The News+ service feels flawed from the get-go. Anyone else struggling to understand the logic behind how you use it?,"I was excited to check out News+ and after the initial errors it was throwing I‚Äôm left with several points of confusion that I feel point to obvious flaws in its design. Curious if anyone else is thinking about the following:

1. There‚Äôs no ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù button when viewing the list of titles. There‚Äôs no simple way to indicate ‚ÄúI want to read THIS title and this want to be notified when new issues of THIS title are released.‚Äù There‚Äôs really no notion of subscribing to anything at all. When a new issue of [insert title] is released, how will I know? Where does that live in the app?
2. Playing off the comment above, the ‚ÄúMy Magazines‚Äù list doesn‚Äôt show titles you‚Äôve downloaded, only those you‚Äôve actually started reading. As far as I can tell, you must begin reading an article in a title for it to appear in the Recent list. 
3. You can only find magazines you‚Äôve downloaded but not read in the Browse the Catalog section. There‚Äôs no way to filter this list by those titles you‚Äôve downloaded, which means  you have to go back through the Browse the Catalog sections to find them.
4. There‚Äôs nothing that allows you to bookmark / dog ear / pin a page or article to return to later. This one really irritates me. Magazine readers often don‚Äôt finish a long article in a single sitting (think train commuters who have to stop reading an article at the end of their commute) and dog-earring a page is a common way of saving your spot. In News+, if you step away from an article you‚Äôve  it finished, two things don‚Äôt happen: 1) You have no ability to save the spot you stopped reading in the article, and, 2) nothing in the UI lists articles you‚Äôve been reading, or stopped reading. At best, Apple could have built in a ‚Äúsave my spot‚Äù feature. Even better, I‚Äôm sure they could have used the software to detect the pace of scrolling an article, determined where you might have stopped reading, and prompt you to return to any unfinished article after you step away.
5. Lastly, because the format of the News+ designed articles is so nice and perfect for the device you‚Äôre on, IMO Apple should have excluded titles that were simply porting over a PDF of their physical print magazine. It‚Äôs just a clumsy, poor experience, and hopefully that changes in the future from certain titles.
