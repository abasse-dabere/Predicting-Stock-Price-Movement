apple,PSA: If you are an employee anywhere - when at the Apple Store see if your company receives a business discount! TIL My Company gets 20% off all apple products.,"So I went to exchange my iPhone 7 yesterday and the girl working with me was extra helpful - we were talking about how I'm always on the hunt for deals and she explained the apple works with many businesses in order to get their products in places.

She asked where I worked and I told her and she said 'oh - see you guys get 20% off all apple products, we're going to save you a lot!'

My company doesn't tell anyone this - it isn't listed under the employee discount section on our company site or anything.

It was seriously a cool find - definitely check in to it!

As an aside - you must do this in store or over the phone - online there is no way to input your business info for the employee discount

Edit: sorry for the confusion the entire discussion seems to have turned to the amount of discount and my topic title of 'all apple products' my discount isn't 20% across the board and varies based on products and services.

apple,Android fanboy who switched back to an iPhone - I've been missing out! [Mini Review],"So I just switched from a Galaxy S7 Edge to an iPhone 7 Plus after watching the keynote this year and figuring I should at least give iPhones a chance. I still use an Honor 5X for work, and I've been deep into the Android ecosystem for probably 4 years now. 

I can't believe it.

You guys have been hiding away such a fantastic product and I had absolutely no idea. I'd heard the usual chatter about ""user experience"" and ""specs aren't everything"" thrown around about the iPhone, but I figured nothing could be better than my 1440p AMOLED and Exynos 8890 combo and I was dead wrong. Here are some of my initial observations for those who might be considering jumping ship:

* Display: Not quite as ""punchy"" as the S7 Edge's AMOLED, but this comes with the benefit of (according to the technical reviews) ""Visually Indistinguishable From Perfect"" color accuracy. If I take photos on this and I see a sunset in a range of colors, I can be pretty darn sure my photos will look just as I remember on the display with the new wide gamut color.

* UI speed: This is the single biggest difference I've noticed between my S7 Edge and the 7 Plus. Where Google Maps would chug along at around 20-40 FPS on my S7 Edge, it's 60 FPS solid on the iPhone. Switching apps is fast, and the 7 Plus keeps way more in memory with its 3GB of RAM than my S7 Edge ever could even with 4GB. Menus fly, animations all keep a solid 60FPS, and it just feels polished.

* Customizability: This is the one thing that had been keeping me away from an iPhone, is the lack of being able to customize the UI. I was surprised to find that many of the default Apple apps can be removed from the homescreen now, and without any carrier crapware I could cut it down to about 12 apps on the homescreen to start. Folders are essential here, but you can keep a minimalist first home screen and move more apps to the following screens like an app drawer, so I can make it work.

* Battery life: Both phones are superb here, but the iPhone edges out solely because it can make it about an hour or two longer than my S7 Edge. The impressive part is that it does that with a 20% smaller battery. iOS doesn't appear to have many wakelock issues or issues with Apple services sucking 30% of my battery like my S7 Edge did. I can play Tiny Wings at medium brightness for 30 minutes and only go down about 5-6% in battery, if that. On the S7 Edge, that would have been an easy 10% drop.

* Build quality: Again, both phones excel, and the difference here is down to personal preference. Some people like dual-sided glass and thin edges, some people like metal bodies and rounded edges. I felt a Note 7 as well, and it definitely felt like the Note 7 was attempting to emulate the rounded sides on the iPhone. Build quality on the iPhone 7 Plus is 100% solid, with no creaking or bending at all and a solid feel in the hand.

* Updates: Obviously Apple has this on lockdown, since I've already got iOS 10.1 Beta running on my phone and the S7 Edge doesn't even have Android 7.0 yet. I'll have iOS 10.1 full on the day of release. 'Nuff said.

* Ports: This is a huge point of contention, so I'll just state my use case and leave my impressions there. I never charge and listen at the same time, since I like to either listen while exercising or pace while I listen, both of which obviate plugging my phone into the wall. That said, I plugged my Lightning-3.5mm adapter into my Shure SE215's and plan to leave it that way for the foreseeable future. I basically just converted my SE215's into Lightning headphones for $9, which I think is pretty alright. The Lightning port feels steady and doesn't let go of cables easily. My microUSB cables wear out within 3-4 months of use, so I'll have to wait and see how Lightning cables and adapters hold up over time.

* Charging: Big area where Samsung has the lead. No fast charging on the 7 Plus, though using a 2A charger does give it juice a little faster. Somewhat mitigated by the smaller battery needing less time to charge anyways, but if you need a quick boost of juice, expect the iPhone to charge about 1% every 2-3 minutes at ideal charging speeds where the S7 Edge could do about 1% a minute.

* Messaging: On the S7 Edge, I had Hangouts, Messenger, FB Messenger, GroupMe, Allo, and Duo installed. On the iPhone, I keep FB Messenger, GroupMe, and iMessage. That's it. Apple does unified messaging a lot better than Android, I'll tell you that much. SMS fallback is quick and easily distinguishable, and FaceTime calls are seamless out of the iMessage app. GIFs load inline and play in the conversation view window, where on Android they load with a ""Play"" button on them.

Overall, I'm floored with what I've been missing. This is a spectacular device and for the $769 asking price for the 32GB 7 Plus, it's absolutely a better deal than the S7 Edge at most US carriers and a solid bet even for $100 more than the unlocked $669 model at B&amp;H Photo Video. If you want any more in-depth experiences, comment and I'll do my best to answer questions for anyone looking to change from Android to iOS.",237,305,2016-10-02,AAPL,0.03232286963611841,0.9233490526676178,0.0443281177431345
iphone,iPhone 7 Plus: first impressions from long time android user,"I have never owned an iPhone. There have been times when I despised what iPhones were representing (in my subjective opinion). I wasn't an android fan boy, but I was not very open to trying out IOS. I had blackberries, galaxy s2, s3, s5, s6, s7edge and now the Note7. The exploding note fiasco and an annoying exchange process combined with warming feelings for apple products (have an iPad Air 2 for past year and I love it) steered me towards the iPhone 7 plus. The fact that even the 6s plus is faster than the Note7 in benchmarks made the A10 powered iPhone 7 plus an easy choice.

I've only had the phone for 5 days, but since then my sim hasn't been put back into the note 7. I really like this device. It is incredibly fluid and fast. Apps that took a while to load on android are almost instant on iOS. The A10 processor screams! The Touch ID and solid state button are amazing. iMessage works flawlessly and has some really cool features. I thought downgrading to an LCD 1080p panel would be an issue, but this screen is great. Obviously the blacks aren't as deep (duh they're not turned off like (amoled) but the colors are great and whites are amazing. The entire OS works really fluidly. I really enjoy the dual camera setup, it's really nice to be able to focus on things clearly.

Another thing i really, really appreciate it how it just works, while still allowing for some fine tuning if you want. With android, I spent countless hours ""tweaking"" the OS and apps to get battery life to behave. I was always checking battery hogging apps and services and looking for misbehaving processes. This was very annoying and it wasn't an isolated issue. If you go on a lot of android forums, you'll see. All it takes is one wrong system update or rogue app to totally wreck the performance/battery life of the phone. Then it's a goose hunt to find what's messed up. I won't miss it.

All in all, so far this phone is awesome. I'm really enjoying it and getting more comfortable with it everyday. One last thing that I thought would be a gimmick is 3D Touch, I actually use it all the time, it's great.

Glad I took the plunge and bought one",194,298,2016-10-02,AAPL,0.03830721601843834,0.9244916439056396,0.0372011624276638
apple,(iOS 10) Do you miss the ‚ÄúGroup By App‚Äù option in Notification Center? Tell Apple!,"**Do you miss the ‚ÄúGroup By App‚Äù option in Notification Center?** I greatly do.

Back in iOS 9, we had this nice and useful option in the Notification Center settings:

http://i.imgur.com/VcKL6Js.png

Now in iOS 10 that option is gone. It simply does not exists. So, with iOS 10, the notifications are not grouped by app.

I've been using this options since first available with the original Notification Center, in iOS 4, if I recall correctly. Now that this is gone, it greatly disrupts my daily usage workflows. I find my self clearing one by one dozens of notifications corresponding to a single app, compared with iOS 9, when you just needed two taps to clear all notifications from a single app.

As far as I can tell, there is no user advantage or convenience in removing the ""Group By App"" option in Notification Center.

If you feel the same, please tell Apple!

**EDIT 24 hours later:**

Well, maybe I am in a bad mood or something, but today I am hating my iPhone because of the missing ""Group By App"" option.

Please check this short video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/f9ikag81ukocst0/iOS%2010%20notification%20center%20hell.mp4?dl=0

Please note that to record this short video I dismissed like 40 notifications before recording, notifications that could expose private information that I do not want to show on the Internet. So, the real life situation is way worse that what is shown on this video.

Try to find an important notification between all this mess.

This is no issue with the ""Group By App"" option: I have no time to pay attention to all the notifications at all times of day. So, they pile up as the day goes. Later, when I have a couple of minutes, I read thought notifications, dismissing by app, quickly finding any important notification and dismissing the ones corresponding to an app that I do not want to attend now. How much time does it takes in iOS 9? Maybe 20 seconds. Now is a f*****g hell, because I have to dismiss one by one, or alternatively, all for a day (and I do not want to do that).

Apple wants developers to update their notifications to be self-updatable? Right, that would be great. But in the real world it will take years before most developers do that, if they ever do.

Apple should have a solution for this mess, a solution that depends only on Apple, not on third party.

This is inexcusable. This has no sense. How is this ""convenient"" or ""better"" for the user??? It is not!!!

You don't like ""Group By App""? Don't use it! But, please, Apple, bring it back to the ones that we like that!",68,268,2016-10-02,AAPL,0.0803387239575386,0.8908143639564514,0.028846904635429382

apple,What's with all the hate toward the AirPods? I feel like I'm the only one here legitimately excited for them.,"Seriously, am I the only one pumped to get these? I feel like all I've read since they were announced is a steady stream of complaints:

1. If you're afraid of losing or breaking them, don't buy them. I literally don't know what else to tell you. What did you think wireless earbuds would be like? I have Bragi Dash wireless buds and I've never lost them once because they're either in my ears or in their case. Period.

2. If you rely on cheap earbuds because you consider them disposable or share with your family and your kids break or lose them, don't buy them. These are $160 earbuds. My Dash cost $300. Like, Apple now has one of the cheapest truly wireless buds on the market, which is crazypants given that Apple usually likes to cater to the premium crowd. Don't let your kids use $160 earbuds, regardless of whether or not they're wireless. Give them the free EarPods that came with your phone and use the AirPods for yourself.

3. If you just don't like how the existing EarPods fit, well, apparently these fit differently and are much less likely to fall out of your ears, so maybe wait until they're actually out before you write them off completely.

4. If you don't like how they look because of the piece sticking out, know that a) those antennae will ensure a solid, steady signal and great mic quality, b) the general public is already familiar with the AirPods design *a month* before they're even out so don't worry, people will understand what you're wearing, and c) no, you're not *girly* for having something that *kinda sorta* resembles an earring (that insecurity doesn't look great though). But if the look still bothers you so much, *don't buy them.* Nobody is forcing you to.

apple,[UPDATE / I'm a believer] What's it going to cost to replace the entire body of a 3 day old macbook pro?,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5506he/whats_it_going_to_cost_to_replace_the_entire_body/ 

I took my laptop into the local apple store that I had originally purchased it from. I met with a genius bar guy who looked things over and the estimate to repair it just got worse and worse. He first saw the damage to the keyboard portion of the case and said it was going to be at least $500 to fix that piece. Then he saw the minor dent on the bottom and it bumped up to $800 at least. Finally he saw the minimal bend on the top case and the repair cost soared to at least $1200 to get the damages fixed. 

At that point I was completely in shock. I couldn't understand how half of the cost of the device came from just the piece of aluminum that wrapped around it. The genius bar employee could see that I was devastated and asked me to wait while he went and got his manager. 

She came over and looked at things and could see that it was going to be incredibly costly to repair the damage. When I told her the story of how the computer had become damaged she was honestly more concerned about whether I was ok than about the condition of the computer. She then said she would have to go check on whether they had parts in the back and disappeared. I wasn't sure what her plan was at that point, but I let her work her magic.

About 5 minutes later she came back and told me that since the computer was a week old and it really was a terribly unfortunate she was going to swap the device just this one time. At that point I almost started weeping in the Apple store because I was so relieved and so incredibly grateful.

She told me the new computer was on its way and that I should be more careful when biking. I wanted to leap over the counter and give her a huge hug. 

They wiped my old computer, took it out to the farm, and gave me the new computer. 

This macbook is my first Apple product ever, and I can safely say that I will be sticking with them for a very long time. I bought this computer after three months of trying to get a Dell XPS repaired, you can see that saga here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/54c2xw/dc_after_three_almost_four_months_of_trying_to/

That trip to the Apple store removed a tremendous amount of stress from my life in so many more ways than anyone there that day could ever have imagined. I want to give a huge thank you to everyone at the Georgetown Apple store. Y'all are the best!

Also I don't want to answer every mail in GMail that I open through notifications, I just want to read them :(.

The notifications are really ugly, what's with those rounded edges and the bright white?

Easily, one of the most annoying changes in iOS 10.

Edit: Alright, I guess that many of you feel the same way. Now, we all know that the design of notifications in iOS 9 was great, can we all agree to submit this feedback to Apple again? It's not wrong to do this, it's what we want from our most used devices. If there is anything wrong with that, your opinion is welcome of course.

Maybe Apple could develop a more fluent experience for notifications, maybe even a bug free one, again.

I checked the reviews for this App, it has 10 5 Star ratings with no comments. then i checked for more by this developer... another is called Crazy Craft - Minecraft PC it appears to be the same amount of star ratings as the previous App. That's when i know it's faked.

I know that Apple is taking it seriously but when Apps hit Top charts, i see people buy it without thinking.. So hopefully reporting can be something that can alert Apple to review and remove as quick as possible.

apple,[UPDATE] I was going to sell my iPad Pro when suddenly.... a wild iCab and Documents appeared.,"A few months ago I found a super deal on an iPad Pro. The 128GB LTE for less than 720‚Ç¨. I was in Japan and I couldn't help myself. Bought it.

Maybe you read me here and there complaining about it being a super big iPhone. 

It was my third iPad after an iPad 3 (for Fifa and reading, sold it) and an iPad Mini (for reading, my girlfriend has it) and I thought I was going to have the Pro for a while and then sell it for profit. The thing is that it started growing on me although I couldn't use it for any professional stuff, nor Indesign, nor Photoshop, nor PDF Editing, nor Audition...

First I tried Procreate. I must say the pencil is way better than my wacom. My father and I spent a whole weekend drawing with it and I have to admit that the pencil really IS AWESOME.

Then I tried some games. I even thought I could keep it as a gaming machine. Some action games are super nice to play on it, but strategy and puzzle games are very very addictive on this screen. I'm eager to try a MFI controller. But still, I could get almost 1000‚Ç¨ for this. It's like 250‚Ç¨ of profit...

But, but, oh man... I just downloaded and tried some apps including Documents and iCab and discovered I can do my whole paper correction workflow on it. I'm a teacher and I need to download and correct around 300 PDFs a week. The workflow is a bit messy. There are the files on a server, they are downloaded by folders in ZIP files, I have to uncompress them, edit the 300 PDFs and upload them again, compressed. Easy peasy on Windows or Mac. But for me, until now, impossible on the iPad. Until today.

Most of this was impossible because of Safari and the file management between Apps until iOS 7. Desktop version of the server would not open and I wasn't able to download files from it. I could see it as a mobile version. I managed to set up iCab to download the zip files. I sent them to PDF Expert but it couldn't uncompress and then edit. Zip Extractor made an uncompressed folder but then I had to send all the Files to PDF Expert... ONE BY ONE. Not all folders.  Tried Documents and boom, it CAN decompress and then edit the PDFs. So I started trying to correct the papers from the 300 students and with the form factor plus the pen I was faster than on the iMac. I kept going just for fun. I have finished like in 1/2 of the time. I must say I was changing from App to App (Excel to pass the notes) and I was like a beast, faster than ever. Even faster than when I had a Surface. There is no lag, the pencil is aaammaaaazziiing and there are no bugs or lags.

The only thing I have to figure out is how to put these folders back into ZIP files, back to iCab and send them to the server.

My first option is plugging it to iTunes and taking the files out from Documents. But anyhow, I think there must be a way to not use the Mac.

Can this really become a work machine? It is perfectly capable of running any program because its performance is out of the question but, why is it not getting some serious software? Adobe do it already, I will pay you, I swear I will pay you whatever crazy price you ask for. But just give it a proper keyboard support and I will dump the Macbook (meaning, sell it for a good price).

I was like alright, I'll just let the phone charge while I plug my earphones into the plane for music or a movie.  Then it struck me, I didn't bring the 3.5mm headphones with me.

apple,Email threads on iOS 10 are a mess,"I am frequently in multiple email threads at a time for work and I love the ability of keeping them organized into a single thread group instead of having each one show up as a separate email.

I want to see the most recent one at the top when I open an email but instead, I get placed in the middle of the thread but it's somehow still the most recent one. Everything seems like it's been doubled &amp;amp;amp; it is just so visually irritating. I loved the way it looked in iOS 9.

apple,"I hope Touch ID becomes embedded to the display. That would mean, we no longer get interrupted when interacting with notifications or widgets. It'll be seamless. As if there was no Touch ID or lock.","Whenever I manage mail notifications from my lock screen, I would always get interrupted by being told to enter my fingerprint or enter my passcode, its more of a nuisance since I have the iPhone 7 Plus, and I would have to slide my grip to the bottom of the device. It isn't so ideal when walking down a sidewalk.

Think about it, if the speed of Touch ID is super fast (if not faster in the next model), getting into a phone through notifications or widgets would be SO seamless. As if there was no lock at all.

Sliding up from the bottom left to enter a proactive app (since your fingerprint scans your thumb the moment you touch the icon/display, the device is already unlocked) = no interruptions, it would be so simple. You would literally forget about there being a Touch ID.

Got a YouTube notification? Tap it, boom you're instantly in the video. No more awkwardly trying to reach to the bottom of the display to scan your fingerprint. It scans it the moment you tap or 3D Touch the notification. And it now makes sense to 3D Touch a notification, since you're more firm when pressing it, your skin will flatten around the display.

You know how the fingerprint icon shows up on the pop up when it asks you for Touch ID or when you purchase apps? What if that literally became a button for Touch ID on the display. You simply tap on it as if it was a button because the whole screen is Touch ID. üò±

When trying to use widgets from the lock screen, activate an action and boom you're in the app. We would actually forget about an actual ""lock"" asking us for our passcode or fingerprint. And when others use it, they'll be the ones getting the interruption. That would be incredibly magical. ‚ú®",57,279,2016-10-10,AAPL,0.06363674998283386,0.9101831912994385,0.026180021464824677
apple,"Hi, I'm a Note 7 refugee with some very specific iPhone and iOS questions before I make an exchange.","I've been an Android user for a long time, since the Galaxy S2 was new. I picked up a Note 7 when they came out, and lived with the recall and the surrounding chaos because, hey, I can forgive a company for just one screw-up, right? Well, now there's possibly another recall coming, and carriers are already offering free exchanges and pulling sales of Note 7s. So now I'm considering doing an exchange for an iPhone 7+, since my phone is probably the last piece of hardware in my home that isn't part of Apple's ecosystem. But, I have a few questions before I can make the move:


1. Does iOS have a password manager that functions similarly to Lastpass on Android? Lastpass on iOS has very limited app login autofill functionality, and I'm used to my login stuff automatically populating with a fingerprint read. Preferably something multi-platform like Lastpass, but I can live with periodically importing my Lastpass vault to something else.

2. Have there been many outstanding problems with the newest lineup of iPhones? I know Samsung manufactured the battery for at least the 7+, and there are some sparse reports about those catching on fire too. I'm not too torn up over the headphone jack thing because easy solutions exist (one comes in the box), but I want to stop my wild ride of monthly phone returns.

3. Is there anything that I can expect to dislike about iOS 10 or current iPhones feature-wise compared to the Android devices that have come out in the past few years?

* Can't make calls with it without passcode (tried ""Call Mom"", required passcode to dial)
* Can't show contact info
* Can't view notifications
* Can't take it out of airplane mode

So what do I do with this thing? I was able to view the medical ID info on this thing and see the owner's name, but they didn't put any contact info in there. Only their birthday. Searching the name on Facebook didn't bring anything up either.

Is there no way to squeeze any more info out of this one? It's stuck in airplane mode (control center seems to be disabled when passcode isn't entered) so i won't be getting any more calls on it from worried owners.

I tried searching the subreddit for info but no one seems to have come across a passcode-required lost iPhone before.  

Edit:

I was able to get it out of airplane mode by going to Emergency, the dialing 611 to prompt the ""please disable airplane mode"" pop up. Once disabled, calls and texts came flooding in and I was able to get a hold of owner's aunt.

They came back to my house with me because after I told them what happened they were freaked out. 

My dad checked, his history says that he facetime my sister, hers says she never got a call. He tried calling he again and she got it like normal. He has the right number, and all of my sister's apple devices are here with us.

apple,IMO the iPhone 7 Plus camera is well worth the jump from the 6 Plus.,"Got the 7+ Friday night, immediately updated to 10.1 to mess around with the bokeh feature. Does NOT disappoint. Another reason to not bring my DSLR for casual pictures taking.

The portrait mode is fantastic, it uses the 56mm, although it requires a lot of lights to be able to complete the photo. So if you want bokeh in low light settings, it will not work. Therefore it can't replace a f/1.8 50mm with steady hands in low lights. The 28mm, however, is fantastic in low lights, grain is minimal, image stability is very awesome. Comparable to the 17-55mm f/2.8 IS lens slapped onto a cropped frame. Once again, I've only tested it for casual pictures taking, for Instagram and Facebook, etc. I haven't done any large shoots with it, I should try it one of these days.

One issue I've had with the 6 Plus was the finger print sensor thing. It only captures my finger when my finger is in a certain condition. If I'm sweaty, it wouldn't work, if the weather is humid, it wouldn't work, if it's sunny out, it wouldn't work, if I'm too dry, it wouldn't work. It sucked major ass. I've heard the 6S already improved the issue, but I couldn't justify buying the 6S with the minor improvements. Along with the pressure sensitive screen, I held off upgrading to the 6S and waited for the 7. I think it's worth the wait, and those two upgrades are pretty awesome.

The phone is a lot faster. My 6 Plus was lagging, specially after updating to the newest iOS 10. There was a slight lag in keyboard mode, in Safari switching between tabs, etc. Silky smooth in 7. I got the 128GB because I heard the HDD speed of the 32GB is slower than the 6? I don't know. I thought, just another $100, might as well.

Anyway, I'm very very happy with the phone. The phone didn't change much at all. It just looks like an iPhone 6 with 2 cameras. But the camera and the better home button really made my day.

apple,Beware Craigslist,"I wanted to create a post to describe the nightmare I just experienced in hopes of deterring anyone from making the same mistakes that I have made.

I sold my iPhone 7 on Craigslist yesterday for $700 cash. A nice girl texted me in the morning and asked to meet me later that day somewhere public to ensure our safety. Her phone number was from my area so I thought everything seemed fine. 

Upon meeting with her later that day, she seemed like a nice young woman. She told me that she attended the same college that I did and that she was a Junior. I asked her what she studied, and she thought for a moment and then said that she was studying public health. She looked at the phone to make sure it was as described (mint condition) before counting the cash in front of me on the table. I took the money, and counted it again myself to make sure. Four hundred dollar bills and six fifty dollar bills - $700. The money looked good and had markings in all of the right places. I took her money, shook her hand, and we parted ways. 

I went to the bank this morning to deposit the money. The bank teller counted the money and then asked me where I had gotten it. I told him that I had just sold a cell phone on Craigslist yesterday. I was then informed that the cash I had handed him was counterfeit money, and that the money would need to be sent to the Fed. He asked me a couple of questions about the transaction before telling me that my best bet was to talk to the police. 

As it would turn out, the phone that texted me the previous day was a phone number generated from an app called ""TextPlus"" or ""Text+"", which can generate phone numbers with an area code of your choosing. The number isn't traceable and there's nothing more I can do except to eat this huge loss. 

Please be careful when dealing with people on Craiglist, or any similar websites. It's a sad day when you realize that even dealing with cash isn't enough of a safeguard against scam artists. Always carry around a counterfeit marker and check every bill because regardless of who you're dealing with, there's always the chance that they are trying to really screw you.


**Edit: (Update on Situation)**
I spoke to T-Mobile and had them blacklist the phone so it couldn't be used anymore. I also met with a police officer who had me describe the woman who purchased the phone as well as some various other information. He told me detectives would look into it, but that they have a lot on their plate right now so it may not be handled in the immediate future. I also spoke to my apartment complex who has the security footage of the exchange. Hopefully the video and my description are enough to find the scammer. Now, I have an incident number from the police; and the only thing left to do is to shell out for a new phone. Bummer - as if college students weren't poor enough!

apple,Opinion: I love Apple News. It is disappointing for me that it's not available on Macs.,"Apple News is, in my opinion, great. Not only does it look good, but the articles it pulls for me are actually articles I'm interested in. 

Having said that, I wish I could have the Apple News app on my MBP. I have an iPad so I do have access to Apple News, but I don't use it that often. My phone is not an iPhone but a Huawei P9, and I use Flipboard to get my daily dose of Internet news, but the Flipboard experience is not comparable to Apple News. I use my MBP daily though, and I'd be super happy if I could have the same reading experience I have on my iPad on my laptop. 

Anyone else feel the same way?",91,268,2016-10-19,AAPL,0.019105469807982445,0.9246765375137329,0.05621804669499397

apple,"""Hey Siri"" is how we initialize Siri hands-free, but when we're in the Siri screen, ""so..."" ""okay,..."" ""and..."" etc should be how we provoke Siri to listen again, instead of ""Hey, Siri"". It would be less awkward and it'd be more natural","# Example

Me: ""Hey, Siri wiki Dunken Donuts.""

*Siri: Okay, here is the Wikipedia for Dunken Donuts.*

Me: ""**SIRI**, where's the closest Dunken Donuts near me?""

*Siri: Here is what I found.*

Me: ""**SO**, what time does it close at?""

*Siri: The store is open 24/4.*

Me: ""**OKAY**, give me directions how to get there.""

---

After you initialize Siri with ""Hey, Siri"" and your now in the Siri screen, trigger words like ""Siri"" ""So"" ""Okay"" ""Well"" ""And"" and some others should provoke Siri, instead of awkwardly saying ""Hey Siri""

apple,"Switching from Android to an iPhone 7+, two week analysis","**Context:** The last iPhone that I have owned was the iPhone 4s.  It served me well, until it was time to upgrade.  My choice was a Samsung Galaxy S4, and a few years later I switched to a OnePlus 2.  There was no particular reason why I went from Apple to Android, I just wanted to try something new.  However, I can safely say, I have owned many more Android devices than iOS devices.  Long story short, my OnePlus 2 has been nothing but trouble, and instead of going back to Android I decided to give iOS a try.  So far I have owned an iPhone 7+ Jet Black 128GB for roughly two weeks now.

----Things I like----

* **iCloud:**  I have an iPad Pro 9.7‚Äù, and I love the continuity between the two devices.  I take notes in class on my iPad frequently, and can access them on my iPhone when I don‚Äôt have access to my iPad via iCloud sync.  All my movies, pictures, music, videos, ect. can be accessed and shared between the two devices.  I have text and call forwarding to my iPad which is really cool.  This allows me to work on homework while my iPhone is charging, and still can answer friends and family members.

* **Siri:**  I know Siri is often hated on, but I am enjoying this feature.  My common uses include: setting reminders, changing songs/artists handsfree in the car, setting alarms, replying to text messages, and continuous weather updates.  Simple as those tasks may be, I never used a voice assistant on an Android device, so these features are awesome and new to me.

* **iOS:** My god this operating system is clean.  So far I‚Äôve never had to do a hard reset, which is a first for me.  Switching tabs is quick and snappy, the touchscreen is extremely responsive and doesn‚Äôt freeze up, all my apps just simply work without any weird compatibility updates, and I find that navigating my settings are far easier than any android OS I‚Äôve used.

* **Design/hardware:** The home button is addictive.  I find myself pressing it all the time, even when I don‚Äôt want to use my phone.  Showing people the haptic feedback has been so fun.  I always see the same look on peoples face when I try to explain it to them, and then when I have them experience it.  It‚Äôs literally an ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment every time.  The dual speakers are sweet.  I‚Äôm not a huge audiophile, but these things put out some serious sound.  The camera on the iPhone 7+ has been the best camera I‚Äôve ever owned.  I‚Äôm not into photography, and I hate taking pictures.  However, this has encouraged me to start taking tons of them.  I can‚Äôt get over how high the quality is.  My family hates me, because I keep sending them HDR pictures all the time, but I just can‚Äôt help it.  The battery life is much better than any phone I have owned in the past.  I can get away with charging my phone every other day while using it for calls, texts, music, and internet browsing very frequently.  The display is excellent.  I know that 1080p may not be able to compete with some of the other AMOLED devices, but the quality of the display is great.  Lastly, I‚Äôm quite certain that the antenna bands (I have the AT&amp;T GSM model), are significantly stronger than my OnePlus 2.  I seem to be getting stronger signal, in more places, than I have before.

* **MISC:** I love the stock keyboard.  I‚Äôve used Swype for most my texting on my previous devices, and was a little bummed that I wouldn‚Äôt have it on my iPhone (I know they have it on the app store, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs not the same quality).  3D touch is an extremely innovative feature.  I‚Äôll admit that I don‚Äôt use it all the time, but I like the direction it‚Äôs headed in.  Most of the stock iOS apps are excellent.  I love iMessage, photos, music, ect., and cannot see myself replacing them.  Night shift mode is a nice added feature, and reminds me of my iPad‚Äôs truetone display.  Finally, I love the new lock screen, and having the ability to swipe left to view specific widgets or swipe right to access the camera quickly.

---Things I wish I Could Change---

* 3D touch a specific grouping of messages on the lock screen to close them all (Ex: all my Facebook messages, but keep my app store updates notifications)

* 3D touch from the control panel.  It would be a godsend to 3D touch the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth icon to choose to connect or disconnect from saved access points/devices

* Alarm Clock (stock clock app):  I wish I could stop the alarm after I have pressed snoozed on.  The only way that I have found to work is to unlock my device, open the clock app, and disable the alarm and then reactivate it for the next day.  This is an awful lot of work for somebody who just woke up.

* Having the ability to click links from my messenger apps that are from YouTube, and watch the videos from the YouTube app.

**Tldr;** Used Android devices for the past several years.  I have done a complete 180 and love everything about my new iPhone 7+.  However, there are a few minor tweaks I would change if I had the chance.",113,212,2016-10-21,AAPL,0.03359495848417282,0.8974540829658508,0.06895093433558941
iphone,From 6S to 7+ to 6S,"When I first heard the rumors of the no headphone jack, I said to myself, ""No chance I would get a phone without an audio jack. I have nice headphones that I want to use with my phone."" As time went on I realized more and more, I mostly use my earbuds with my phone and my nicer headphones with other products at home. Then I got into the world of bluetooth headphones and thus, the I thought, ""maybe the 7 isn't so bad after all."" And to be totally honest, it wasn't bad at all. I ended up buying a 128gb Matte Black 7 plus outright around launch and used it for about a month and the no audio jack didn't really bother me at all. 

What I did find was that it was not that different of an experience from my 6S, which is truly what I wanted, and still want. I ended up selling my 7+ and moving back to my 6S for the time being. I still love the iPhone, but I am hoping that the 8/10th anniversary phone is truly something new and exciting. For me, the 7 was just a very minor change with a lot of hype. The dual speakers did not make that big a difference at all, and while the 6S may not be IP67, I've dropped it in water and used it in the rain without issue countless times. I also watch netflix in the shower with it daily. The camera was very nice, but for my purposes, the camera alone was not enough to justify the upgrade. I did not notice a big difference in speed with the A10 chip. I did notice a difference in battery, but thats because of the plus vs non plus issue. While I had the 7 plus, the batter was good, but nothing life changing. 

All in all, if you currently have a 6S and are wondering if it is worth it to make the jump to a 7, I would say no. It quite honestly feels like the same exact phone after a couple weeks. This is just some donkey on the internet stating his opinion, and ultimately you should do what makes you happy!",172,211,2016-10-21,AAPL,0.019911261275410652,0.9120483994483948,0.06804031133651733

apple,'Find My iPhone/Mac App' Found My MBP That I Lost 3 Years Ago.,"Towards the end of 2013, my house was unfortunately broken in and had almost everything aside from furniture stolen from me in a single afternoon. One of those things that were taken was my 2010 top of the line 17‚Äù MacBook Pro with upgraded SSD, RAMs + all the bells and whistles. Thank goodness for insurance, but that laptop was the most devastating loss of all the items that I lost in the burglary as I had only backed up it 9 months prior due to my laziness. So 9 months of photos, videos, memories, intangible things that insurance cannot replace, were gone just like that.

For awhile, I periodically check iCloud to see if the MBP might turned up. I did set a automatic lock on it if it ever connects onlin. It never went online as far as I could tell. Years past and I gave up on every recovering it. 

Then, in 2015, I received a call from the local police station saying they picked up a ‚Äòknown-person-of-interest‚Äô and on her was an iPad (that was also taken from my home). This iPad never had the Find My iPhone app set up, but it has engraved on the back, a name that does not match this person they picked up. Going through their records, the police matched the iPad‚Äôs engraving to my police incident report and promptly dropped it off at my place. I asked the police if the person they picked up could have anything to do with the burglary but they had no evidence that she was involved and thus did not/could not pursue the matter any further as she was picked up on unrelated incident.

While I was happy that I recovered my iPad, the data in it was already long deleted. I didn‚Äôt have any important stuff in it anyways so I wasn‚Äôt too disappointed that it was formatted. 

Fast forward into August 2016, while working on my iMac, I get a ping on my phone and alert on the computer at the same time, stating that the MacBook Pro has been located and locked.  I was confused. I had my MBP (current one) sitting right next to my iMac and why the hell would it be locked from iCloud? I went onto iCloud to see the location where it was pinged and to my surprise and realisation, it was showing a location about 10-20 kilometres away. It all clicked in my head within those nanoseconds. It was the bloody stolen MBP from years ago.

‚ÄúWtf‚Äù 

I contemplated on what to do next. ‚ÄòGo see the place myself?‚Äô ‚ÄòBring friends?‚Äô ‚ÄòCall the non-emergency police line?‚Äô  I had to go through folders upon folders to find my police report number. Called up the non-emergency police and explain that the stolen laptop from 3 years ago turned up on Find My Mac app tonight. Got transferred twice to the appropriate department and the appropriate police station and each time I explained, the surprised reaction from the other end when they realised it was from 3 years ago was quite amusing. 

Within the hour of finding the MBP on iCloud‚Äôs radar, the police sent a car to the house location that I gave them and the policeman who was on location called me and said that they‚Äôll try their best but also say that if the occupant denies them entry into the house, they will have no choice but to leave. I can only hope.

Minutes later, he called again and said he got the laptop and confirm the description matches my report from 3 years ago. At this point I was unreasonably ecstatic. He also said that they have no reason to believe that the person who had my laptop were involved in the burglary. My stolen MBP was apparently bought off from $500 from a group trying to pawn it off at a cash converter but couldn‚Äôt because of a huge deep scratch right down the middle of the screen. Buyer was there to witness it and got it from the group who obviously made up a story about why they were selling it. 

Days later, I received my laptop. Deep scratch from top to bottom in the middle of the screen, body was very roughed up, especially on a corner, like it was dropped heavily. I do remember seeing my broken gym bag strap on the floor of the day of the burglary, so I can only assume it was dumped into my gym bag and in the burglars' haste, the strap broke and dropped the laptop on the corner.

I spent days trying to unlock the laptop as I couldn‚Äôt remember the passcode that I used to set the automatic lock 3 frigging years ago. When I did get it unlocked on a fluke, my **goodness**, my account was still intact somehow with all the memories stored on it still there. It was such a huge relief to find stuff on it that I thought I lost.

I also brought into Apple Store to see if they could fix the screen (they could not), thankfully they still sell the charger for it. (it wasn't picked up by the police unfortunately, and I also forgot to mention it during the search)

Now I have a 6 year old laptop which I only got to use 3 years of it before it disappeared. 

I do have a couple of questions about this lost and found incident though. 

 1) I checked through the browser history and the MBP was definitely online (not on my account though) during the years that it was lost, why didn‚Äôt iCloud detect it until a few months ago?


2) Also, I don‚Äôt know what living condition the guy who bought it is in, but the MBP absolutely *stinks*. It doesn‚Äôt smell anything disgusting but the stench is very strong, sort of like having your coats dry cleaned kinda of smell. Just very pungent. How do I get rid of it? I have tried airing it (unscrewing the bottom panel), running the fans at high speed for hours, wiping it down several times‚Ä¶. nothing seem to diminish the smell. Any advice is much appreciated.

Big thanks to Western Australia Police (Mirrabooka branch) and Apple for the awesome Find My iPhone/Mac app. 

TL;DR Home broken in 3 years ago, lost precious laptop; 3 years later, iCloud picks it up on radar, Police happily retrieved it for me; Laptop now stinks, how to remove smell?

apple,Why do people treat the AirPods as though they only have a 5 hour battery life?,"People often reference the spec that the AirPods will get 5 hours on a charge, and that doesn't seem like a whole lot compared to many other wireless headphones. Even though the case gets 24 hours, the AirPods, themselves, only get 5 hours, and that's disappointing to some people.

That perspective isn't accurate, though. The AirPods' dental floss case isn't just some base station or separate charger. It doesn't function like an additional battery pack that you need to carry around with your other devices. It IS the case. When you take your AirPods out with you, you're probably going to have the small case in your pocket at all times. It's small, light, and easily pocketable. And the second the AirPods leave your ears, they'll go in that case in your pocket for storage. And when they're being stored, they're being charged.

Because of that, the AirPods don't have 5 hours of battery life - they have 24 hours. Unless you want to listen to something for 5+ hours straight without taking break, you'll be adding charge to them from their case.

Because of that, the battery life criticisms I'm seeing from various people and tech journalists (i.e.  Nilay Patel) don't make sense to me. The AirPods effectively have 24+ hours of battery life, which seems pretty darn good to me. What remains to be seen is fit and sound quality. But battery life isn't an issue at all.",352,238,2016-10-24,AAPL,0.038747381418943405,0.936513364315033,0.02473919279873371

First is obviously charging the iPhone/iPad. They could then remove all ports and only have wireless connection to them. 

Second is the airpod case. They say the airpods is wireless but still charge them with cord. This have to go. 

Third I could think of is MacBook. One without any port would solve the possible upcoming loss of MagSafe. Input devices, headphones, storage, all can be used wirelessly without any problems. 

One thing I can't come up with is how they gonna charge them in an ""apple-way"". If they do it like on the watch it's not really wireless I think. Then you need a cord for each device. There should be an better way but still you should be able to charge the devices when on the move.

apple,"iPhone future direction, based on the headphone jack and siri","I was walking home from work the other night listening to music, and quite pissed off at having to untie my headphone cable again. It got me to thinking about Apple's plans for the future of the iPhone.

To me it seems quite strategic that this latest update featured wireless headphones AND an upgrade to Siri. As a software engineer, it seems to me that Apple is heading in a direction where the user interface for the phone is completely separated from the device itself. 

The wireless headphones allow the device to now be located pretty much anywhere - in your pocket, your backpack etc. and then control of the device to then come via voice or any other interface (such as a watch). 

If Apple really is being courageous as they say, then the next phone could potentially take on any form factor at all. Imagine if you could buy the iPhone as essentially a 'server', then choose the user interface method that you prefer. You could have a touch panel for games and apps, voice control for phone/music/walking/running, a watch for basic interaction. Perhaps glasses for snapchat etc. etc. 

I think we are still thinking of this device as a 'phone', when in fact it is a computer where the phone is only one part of it. By continually separating the user interaction, Apple may be moving towards something that is far more revolutionary as a device. I'd be interested to hear what anyone else thinks!",77,169,2016-10-26,AAPL,0.02231336012482643,0.9397273659706116,0.03795929253101349
apple,"How is there not a ""Private Photos"" feature yet on the iPhone?","Considering the massive popularity of dating/sexting/hookup apps, as well as the fact that most people use their smartphone as their primary camera, I'm always very surprised that the iPhone does not have a feature to mark a photo private and hide it away in a password/TouchID protected album.

I can't tell you how many times people have handed me their phones to show me a photo, but are clearly worried about me swiping left or right and seeing something I'm not supposed to see.

Same goes for when I hand over my own phone to someone and get worried about them seeing some pics I would rather them not see. And it's about more than just sex photos too, there are plenty of photos I've taken that I would prefer to be private for other reasons (like photos I've taken to document hair loss, for example).

This seems like it would be such an easy thing for Apple to implement into iOS, and very useful for a whole lot of people, but for some reason it hasn't been done yet.

Sure, there are third-party apps that can hide photos for you, but then those pictures are in a separate library and I'd rather keep everything in one place, in addition to gaining the advantage of native OS support and iCloud backup.

Any thoughts as to why we don't have a ""Private Photos"" feature yet on the iPhone?",64,150,2016-10-26,AAPL,0.0428125336766243,0.9271119236946106,0.03007553704082966

apple,Let's talk about the touch bar.,"I have watched every Apple event live since they made it possible. The touch bar is the first thing Apple has introduced since I can remember that feels like a *complete* gimmick with no added functionality. 

I know that this has been said of touch ID, 3D touch ect but I have always disagreed with the naysayers. This however feels like a stretch for innovation and I honestly cannot see any added utility that the touch bar brings. 

Am I missing something? Will someone enlighten me if that's the case? Are the buttons on the touch bar not already available on my screen - which I am meant to be looking at instead of down on my keyboard??? 

Forget the poorly-reasoned removal of the function and escape keys (which are invaluable for certain pro apps). Just look at how ridiculous Federighi looked staring at the touch bar the entire time looking up down up down just to get some suggested text in the messages app. Are these features not things they could have shown on the screen in the apps themselves?

As a creative professional I am beyond frustrated at what Apple considers innovation compared to what Microsoft is doing. I mean they could have just brought pencil support to the Mac (heck, even if it's restricted to certain apps since macOS is not touch-optimised yet) and it would have been a no-brainer purchase for me. Instead, they not only managed to put out an underwhelming update to their portable pro machines but actually made them less functional than before. Well done, Apple. I wish you the best of luck with your professional customer base but this guy here is done.

Edit: arranged my thoughts into a blog post if anyone would like to have a deeper discussion on this.

This is HUGE from a security point of view. Now Macs, like iPhones and iPads, have a hardware-independent security device. It appears the macOS Keychain has been migrated to use the secure enclave as well. The T1 also runs the webcam on the machine, which keeps it separated from iOS and harder for hackers to access.

The Touch Bar runs independently of macOS, meaning it can run while macOS is not running (i.e. other OS'es). The touch screen is connected to it via USB. 

I'm also impressed with the amount of software engineering effort that Apple put in to implement Touch Bar support into the system apps. Even less obvious apps including TextEdit, Notes, Maps, Contacts, Calendar, Calculator, Activity Monitor fully support the Touch Bar. Developer apps too, such as Terminal and Xcode. While debugging a macOS app in Xcode, you can use the Touch Bar to pause, jump in, etc with breakpoints.

Some preliminary things:

The keyboard does seem to have a bit more travel than the MacBook (from my limited use), but not as much as I had assumed it would. Not saying it is a bad keyboard, it feels fairly nice, but will be a transition for people moving from the old MacBook Pro.

apple,"The true reason the MBP doesn't come with ddr4 or 32gb of ram, more technical then you think.","So, a lot of people have been disappointed at the lack of a 32gb option.

Apple's statement is true, but lacks detail.

The true reason behind the lack of 32gb or ddr4 is intel.
Skylake does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) ram.
Kabylake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips.
So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think.

One example is the del XPS 13.

On the dell XPS 13 version, you cannot go for 32gb of ram.
Meanwhile, the 15 inches does give you that option, but you have to sacrifice battery life for it.

Another example is the surface book, they can't include 32gb.
Only goes up to 16gb.

These computers use LPDDR3 which is supported.
Many mite make the argument that apple could have used the LPDDR3 version, but how would they look if they did that for the 15 inch MBP only?

With intel continuing to drop the ball on these basic things in mobile, I have to call for apple to switch to ARM chips, since intel is incompetent at delivering proper mobile chipsets.

apple,There's a lot of confusion and misinformation about USB-C and Thunderbolt here. This will clear it up.,"There are 2 different technologies here: USB and Thunderbolt.  

Then there's the plug: the C-type plug.  

Both USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 use the C-type plug.  

**Having a C-type plug does NOT automatically mean the cable or device is capable of USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 speeds.  The C-type plug can be anything, even regular USB 2.0.  It's just a shape.**

The Retina MacBook has USB3.1 *Gen 1* with the C-type port.  
USB3.1 *Gen 1* allows for 5Gbps bandwith and power.

The new 2016 MacBook Pros have Thunderbolt 3. 
Thunderbolt 3 has 40Gbps bandwith and power.  

If you want Thunderbolt 3 speeds, you need cables *and* devices that are rated for Thunderbolt 3 speeds.

If you want USB3.1 speeds, you need cables *and* devices that are rated for USB3.1 speeds.

**Just because they use the same plug doesn't mean they have the same capabilities.**


**Edit:** For clarification and as a lot of comments mentioned, there is a speed difference between USB 3.1 Gen 1 and Gen 2 (Gen 1 being 5Gbps and Gen 2 being 10Gbps).  USB 3.1 Gen 1 is the new name for what we knew as USB 3.0.  USB3.1 Gen 2 devices are typically labeled as such or as USB 3.1 10Gbps.

iphone,PSA - Your new iPhone 7 is NOT WATERPROOF.,"Please stop bringing your phones in the shower then complaining that you might have water damage. It seems like every day there is a post about someone complains to us/apple that their phone got damaged or may have been damaged. 

Your new phone is IP67 meaning it's dust and water RESISTANT. 

- The ""6"" means dust cannot get inside the device. 

- The ""7"" means water will not be able to get in under 1 meter of water. This also means that water pressure greater than the water pressure that is being forced on your phone under 1 meter of water WILL get inside and cause damage (Approx 16psi). Most shower heads have a water pressure from 40-60psi to wash that grime off you.  This means (you guessed it) water inside your phone. 

After years of cell phones dying from water damage, our minds should have the habit of keeping electronics away from water. I know for me it's pretty hard to break that habit. I know a spill of my beer won't hurt my phone, that doesn't mean I'm going to let the phone sit in the puddle. 

Your phone is anywhere between $800-1200. Treat it as such. If you have that kind of disposable income, don't complain and buy a new phone.",368,1469,2016-10-30,AAPL,0.1441773772239685,0.8308278322219849,0.024994811043143272

apple,"I'm a Professional MacBook Pro user, and I'm not bothered at all","I'm just trying to contribute my perspective. I don't want to invalidate anyone else's. You may be a professional and have big problems with the update. This is my story, not anyone else's.

I work at a VFX studio that does television, films, commercials, and music videos. We're not the largest, or the most high-end, but if you're reading this you've seen our work. In television alone, we deliver ~35 episodes a month.

First of all, if you haven't seen the writing on the wall that Apple is becoming less interested in high-end computing you haven't been paying attention. The moment everyone realized it, in my world, was when they killed Final Cut 7 and stopped updating their Mac Pro (the trashcan is unused). But they've always been behind the curve on performance, always been stingy with RAM, always had an aversion to ports, and always frustrated people who want the highest level of performance.

The idea that you can operate in a professional environment without dongles is nonsense. Every station in the office (MacBook Pros, Mac Minis, iMacs, custom-built PCs, tablets, ChromeBooks, Televisions) requires a drawer full of cables, adapters, and dongles. I, literally, have buckets (actual buckets) of dongles that I use every day. Behind every set of monitors and computers is a rats' nest of wiring and adapters.

The idea that these are expensive machines doesn't make sense to me. Payroll is by far, not even close, the biggest expense we have. Even if I was a one-man operation, paying my own salary would probably be my biggest professional expense.

If you need 32GB of RAM, 4TB of storage, a monster graphics card, lots of I/O options, and backwards-compatibility with all your exitsting equipment -- I really don't know why you're buying a laptop. *(edit: lots of people have brought up perfectly valid reasons for needing this kind of power in a laptop.

apple,"My experience with the new 13"" MBP and the Razer Core","Yesterday, I picked up a new 13"" MBP from the local Apple store, so I proceeded to try it out with my Razer core, and some of my other Thunderbolt accessories.

When I first plugged it the Razer Core, I was pleased to that it powered the MBP. Unfortunately, the video card didn't show up in the System Report, and while the Core itself shows up under Thunderbolt devices the model name is reported at ""Core - Unsupported"".

I proceeded to try various ways of fixing the problem, none of which worked:

* installed latest nvidia web drivers
* tried different video cards (MSI 1070 &amp; EVGA 660)
* tried [goalque's EFI boot manager and automate-eGPU script](https://github.com/goalque/automate-eGPU)
* tried plugging in Core at various times during boot
* tried powering MBP independently of core

~~As a last ditch measure, I tried installing Windows to see if the hardware would work with the Core. Unfortunately, I got an error when attempting to install Bootcamp (the drivers package was reported as being ""unavailable""). I downloaded the latest drivers package manually, but was again stymied after discovering that the touchpad and keyboard were unusable when booting into the windows 10 installer I made on my windows machine. After plugging an external keyboard and mouse, I made more progress, but was again blocked when discovering that windows couldn't find a storage driver for the SSD in the new MBP.~~

Edit: [Here's a photo of the System Report showing the Razer Core connected to the MBP](http://imgur.com/hTrMsKY). I'm going to try an RX 460 next.

Edit2: The RX 460 didn't help (it did work with my other TB3 laptops though). On recommendation from the folks at Tech Inferno, I also tried an ""active"" 40GB/s cable, which didn't change anything.

Edit3: Success! I installed Windows 10 via Bootcamp, and [it works great](http://imgur.com/JwbSjHU).

Edit4: Thanks to [kid2010 on the netkas forums](http://forum.netkas.org/index.php/topic,11654.msg34140.html#msg34140), we now have a [utility which patches a kext in Sierra to enable TB3 devices, including the Razer Core](https://github.com/KhaosT/tb3-enabler). After installing his patch, I was able to use [goalque's automate-eGPU script](https://github.com/goalque/automate-eGPU) to complete the rest of the process for enabling the Razer Core and video card in OSX. USB works OTB, but I had to [download drivers for the ethernet port from the vendor](http://www.asix.com.tw/FrootAttach/driver/AX88179_178A_Macintosh_10.6_to_10.12_Driver_Installer_v2.8.0_20161108.zip).

Next I proceeded to fix the dreaded ""error 12"" problem - needed to get cards other than my nvidia 660 to work in Windows 10. I found two fixes, both of which work. The simplest method was [posted by Rominator on the netkas forums](http://forum.netkas.org/index.php/topic,11673.0.html), but has the downside of disabling your facetime camera. The other method (which preserves the facetime camera) is a [DSDT override from the techinferno forums](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/5874-guide-dsdt-override-to-fix-error-12/#comment-91134). It's a lot more straightforward than it looks - I was successful in just copy &amp; pasting the values in their guide verbatim. At first, either of these methods results in losing audio out via both speakers and headphone, but disabling and re-enabling the ""Cirrus Logic CS8409 (AB 51)"" audio device in Device Manager restores that too.

AFAIK, there still aren't any OSX drivers for the pascal series of nvidia cards, so I'm currently using a nvidia 980, which works well and is supported in both Windows and OSX.
