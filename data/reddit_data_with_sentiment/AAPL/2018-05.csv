apple,The Apple Music app is horribly designed,"I've been using Apple Music (AM) for a while now and for the most part, I really like it. However, I just can't bring myself to love it.

*tldr:* Although the AM service is great, the app itself is an embarrassment to the pedigree of design that Apple is known for.

***

*Disclaimer:* I'm currently a student, and as such, I'm paying the student price. I also use Spotify. I am currently biased towards the Spotify UX, however, I don't use one more than the other.
***This post is exclusively a complaint about the Apple Music app itself*** and as far as I can tell, the Apple Music service is quite possibly the best music streaming service I can find in regards to catalog size, but God help me if the app isn't atrocious. For something made by Apple, I'm honestly surprised about the UX design nightmare that it is. This post is a little long, so I'm gonna try to break it up into sections.
***
#Overall (tldr... *but longer*)

The Apple Music app is too slow. Not operationally, but functionally. To do a task that should take me as long as it does to snap my fingers, I have to go through too many steps. This seems counter-intuitive to a user friendly design and Apple's overall design principals. Considering people are paying $15/mo. for this service, the app should be a lot better.

#Queuing
Note that I'm only one user and I know no one else in my social circle who uses Apple Music, but as I said above, I think the UX is atrocious. 

I know very little about actual user experience design, however, I use AM everyday and every time I use it, I find myself scratching my head. A big issue I've found with this, for example, is queuing music. With the Spotify iOS app, you need to simply swipe from left to right to queue a song (vice-versa to (un)save a song). This is so elegantly simple and makes using Spotify almost preferable. Now, I'm not saying that AM needs to do this exactly, but [the current process of queuing a song is ridiculous, in comparison.](https://i.imgur.com/WvTWvyy.mp4) 

I get the point of integrating 3D touch to bring up additional options, but to have to hold down a song (while not accidentally playing it) and to then find the option to queue that song in a rather long list of options is a little too much work and too distracting for something that could and should be easily done with a simple motion. When I'm doing work and listening to music, I don't want to have to stop to focus on queuing a song I decided I want to listen to next.

Additionally, ~~I'm not sure if this is a bug or if~~ *I'm just stupid. But I feel like the point still stands that it's still a questionable design choice.* I'm just fat fingering everything, but anytime I search for a song, then try to queue it with what I'm already listening to, AM just decides I meant to play the song I want to queue and will start playing that instead.

With queuing, I think Apple needs to find a simple gesture that's faster and will reduce the likelihood of accidentally playing a song.

#Searching

The issue I have with searching is similar to the one I have with queuing. I think AM's current search feature is great, *for a general search feature* of both my library and all of AM, but it still takes too much work to find one song or one album. If I'm playing my music by song, and I want to find another song to play next, I shouldn't have to go to a different tab, type in what I'm looking for, and then choose from a list of artists, albums, and songs, just to look for and play one thing. 

I'm not saying to remove this. I think it's useful and I still use it as is, but while I'm browsing my own library, I should be able to swipe down to show a search bar that will allow me to search my library based on how I'm currently viewing it. This is something the iOS music app had before (I think they may have removed it when Apple Music became Apple Music). Again, [this is something Spotify does](https://i.imgur.com/X12yMv7.mp4), that I think makes the experience a lot quicker and easier.

The current system of having the alphabet on the right is a bit archaic in that, for the most part, it's a glorified scroll bar.

#Shuffling

This is probably the most controversial thing I'll say, but it really bothers me. 

I think Apple needs to rethink how they shuffle songs. I'm not sure if it's completely random (I think it is) but it annoys the ever-loving fuck out of me. I have a 40 minute commute to work and for the past four days I think I've heard the same 30 songs exclusively... (I want to collect statistics on this, just to make sure I'm not going crazy -- I think this is a gambler's fallacy thing), but I would like it if Apple amended their shuffle algorithm from truly random, to ""random."" [Spotify experienced an issue similar to this and did change their algorithm to make a truly random shuffle feel random by making it not random.](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/)

#Remembering Library Position *(ties into shuffling above)*

This really bothers me and ties into shuffling a bit. When I stop playing music (usually for a long period of time), Apple Music will forget where in my library I left off. This is profoundly annoying and compounds the shuffling issue.

There have been times where I'll get out of my car, come back some hours later, and find that Apple Music is replaying songs that I literally just listened to. I'm not sure if this is because AM reset the shuffle (why?) or what, but I feel like Apple music should tag music in some way that indicates it's already been played for a shuffle period (where a ""shuffle period"" would be one instance of hitting shuffle). For example, if I hit shuffle, Apple Music should *never* decide to play that song again until I choose to shuffle again, or until I finish listening to my library. This should be a thing, but for some reason it's not.
***
These are my biggest issues. I don't think Spotify is perfect but Apple definitely needs to focus on the design of their app just a little bit more... but maybe this is just me and it's all in my head... please let me know.
***
In the spirit of my fondness for the app here's a list of stuff that I like:

1.	Automatic downloads on saved music
2.	[Additional sorting options based on how you're filtering your music](https://i.imgur.com/Q04Yhlx.jpg)
3.	Being able to add files from my computer to iTunes and find them in Apple Music
4.	Ability to pull up lyrics to a song from in the app

apple,My iPhone was robbed and the thief was able to deactivate “Find My iPhone”,"So, here is my story.

I live in Brazil and yesterday 2 guys robbed my iPhone 7 Plus. They had a gun so I just gave it. They asked my lockscreen passcode, but I was to nervous and ended up saying the wrong one.

Anyway, they got away and later I thought “thank god I said the wrong passcode”. After 20 minutes I was able to log in on iCloud and put my iphone on “Erase All” mode, because I didn’t think I could get it back. But, the iPhone was already offline. After 1 hour, I called my phone’s company to block my phone number and SIM card.

Anyway, today I received an email from Facebook saying that my password was changed using my phone number, on a different device. I found out 30 minutes later and changed my password. I also removed the phone number connected to the account. Later, I tested and I found out that if you have a phone number linked to your Facebook account, you can reset you password easily using only a SMS from the phone number, like what!!?? Don’t even ask for email! They probably did it during the hour that I took to block my number. And by doing that, the thief was able to get my information.

Unfortunately, I was using a very stupid 6 letters lockscreen passcode on my iPhone that, probably, he was able to guess from my Facebook. So, they could get into my iPhone now, but it never went online on “Find My iPhone”.

Later today, I received an email from “Find My iPhone” saying that it was deactivated from that iPhone and now anyone could use it! I couldn’t belive, so I checked on iCloud and it was really gone! How could they do that if turned on the “Erase Mode”?? It wasn’t erased because I didn’t receive any e-mail saying it went online and got erased.

I spent the rest of the day changing my passwords and thinking how they did that. So I tested something on my friend’s iPhone. I put it on airplane mode and entered the passcode for the lockscreen, like they would do because they found out my stupid passcode on my Facebook with my phone number. Them, I deactivated the Touch ID (it only asks your lockscreen passcode) and deleted all his fingers. After that, I went to “Accounts and Password” (keychain) and BOOM, everything was there!! Apple ID, everything, using only your lockscreen passcode... and I did it all offline, on airplane mode!! So now, with my Apple Id and passcode, they probably were able to get into “Find My iPhone” and remove it!

So I learned something, you need to use a really strong lockscreen passcode or doesn’t use Apple’s password manager, because it’s really easy to get into it. Also, if I’ve said the correct passcode to them on the first place, they could have deleted Touch ID and  get into the “Accounts and Password”  the same way.

Edit: If the thief get your passcode, they can add a new finger to Touch ID and log in in every app that uses it, like your BANK APPS! I have a bank app that you can even transfer money using only Touch ID! Thankfully, someone here said that 1Password doesn’t allow you to log in with a new finger added without the master password. So to me, 1Password is secure and I will use it for now on.

Edit2: if you want to see if your Facebook account is secure, go to Facebook log in page, go to “Forgot my Password”, put your phone number and search. If your phone number is linked to your Facebook account, you will find your name, number and e-mail (with some ****@****). After that, you can select your number to send a SMS and reset your password, without any email warning during the process! You will receive the reset PIN on any device with your SIM card. Only when you password is changed they will alert you.

Edit3: I had the two-factor authentication method on for iCloud.

TLDR

In resume, what i think happened was:

1-I got robbed. They guesses right my stupid 6 letters passcode and got into the iPhone offline, otherwise it would be erased
2-They removed Touch ID or added a new finger
3-They got all my passwords from keychain, including apple id
4-They reseted my iPhone on DFU mode and after the reset, it asked for the last apple id used to remove “Find My iPhone”
5-They removed it, got a brand new iPhone and access to all my accounts.

My mistake was to use a very obvious passcode and include my apple id on keychain because I probably logged in on iCloud.com in safari some day and saved it. However, I think a big part of Apple’s users may have the same risk.

apple,Would anyone else like one made?,"https://imgur.com/a/smZn4yu/ (updated design below) 
It’s a iPad extension type of thing. I use my iPad Pro 9.7 for notes in school, and when I use it my hand is falls off the side of the iPad, and sometimes it’s uncomfortable like that. So I’ve been looking for something that extends the sides of the iPad to keep my hand level with screen like a normal piece of paper can, but no one makes something like that ( or at least I can’t find it), so I made one myself on fusion. I’m going to be making one of these for myself for school, and I see that this could be useful for other people in art and other note takers. So I’m willing to make more for others if they would like one and think they could use it. So if so pm me or comment below and I’ll let you know if I’m able to do that. And also if it’s not to crazy you could tell what you would like to change like extending it on all sides. But let me know.


Here at Texas A&amp;M, being a engineering student we are able to use the wood and metal Cnc to make what ever we want we just gotta supply materials, so wood. Possibly Aluminium but most likely wood for lightness. Just saying on how it would be made. They supply the tools so I don’t have to deal with that. I could 3D print it, but I’ve been testing it out with a 3D printed version on this, but surface finish isn’t great, so I think wood would be great for this project. I did design it with the iPad 9.7 in mind so I would have to adjusts the dimensions for the 10.5in iPad, and 12.9 (wouldn’t think many 12.9in iPad users would want one of these).

These pictures are multiple iterations and the one with The iPad in portrait is a 12.9in iPad.

This is UBMe!","Hello Reddit, my name is Val Arzunian, and I’m the founder of UBMe. We’re a team of 5 millennials on a mission to make this happen. It’s always exciting making a post (this is my third time) as I’ve gotten great feedback and criticism from the community in the past! We’ve made some big changes since our release, so PLEASE help us with some feedback if you could!!

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ubme/id1200370709?mt=8

**Why we’re doing this**: About 4 years ago I started realizing how much happens locally that people aren’t aware about. With advances in technology and the rise of social networks, we have access to far more information than we did 10 years ago, but our access to local information has yet to catch up with the trend. More and more is happening locally, yet gradually we’re becoming less and less in touch with our surroundings. This hurts local businesses and the local economy, and leaves us feeling more isolated as a society. Nowadays it’s hard to strike up a conversation with a stranger, or find a reason to step away from a screen and leave your home. Without a source of local information, we lose our connection to the here and now, and we become weaker as a society. So 4 years ago, I set upon a mission to get this connection back.

**What we’re doing**: UBMe is the pulse to your local community that makes everything around you come to life. The main feature, which has been live since last year, allows users to check-in to any location and start a live group chat. For example, students can use UBMe to check-in to whichever building they are at on campus and communicate with others in a live group chat. Once you leave the building, you are checked-out. 

Two more features we just added are the heat map and the city-wide chat. The heat map allows users to see where people are checked-in and chatting nearby, and also ask the people who are checked-in there a question about what’s happening there. We also introduced a live group chat that is accessible by every user within the radius of the city, so that everyone in town can communicate at once.

**Our problem**: All of these features (as far as we know) have never been done before, and are entirely new to the world. That being said, we don’t have any examples to follow, we don’t know what works and what doesn’t. So we decided to turn to the smartest community we know ;) . Please feel free to hit us with any criticism, feedback, help with beta testing, whatever! We’re really excited about our mission and what this could potentially do for local communities and society as the app takes off.

apple,Apple Music is approaching three years old and it’s still lacking so much,"Hear me out. It’s been a decent service for the most part, and Siri integration is great, don’t get me wrong. But I have about five major issues that have been so persistent I’m about to throw in the towel, and I can’t imagine I’m the only one:

- Offline downloading is a crap-shoot. Probably about 30% of the time I hit download/the iCloud icon, it doesn’t do anything... the downloading circle starts only to immediately stop and show the iCloud icon again. Is it saved or not? I can’t tell until it finally works three days later. I run into this a lot, surprisingly. 

- Shuffling is mind-numbingly stupid. I can’t tell you how many times I shuffle a playlist and it only shuffles half the songs. Or I’ll get in my car the next day and where it usually picks up where we left off, it suddenly only wants to play a handful of the songs. I was just listening to Post Malone’s new album on shuffle and it decided only about 7-8 songs was enough before it started the exact same shuffle loop of said songs. This is probably my biggest issue since navigation is also not great within Apple Music, so when it happens it feels like a chore to go back and start over. On top of that, when going back to previous songs, it wasn’t the same song that had just played (this has only happened a couple times).

- Tying in to the previous complaint, when it finally does shuffle what I want it to, it will often repeat songs before playing all the songs.

- Music I had purchased and physically on my phone before Apple Music was even a thing is suddenly not available when I don’t have internet. I can download it from Apple Music, but it’s not physically on my phone anymore. I was traveling once and only realized this when it wouldn’t play music I had on my phone for years once I lost connection. I have a big music library, so there is probably still music that I used to have saved to physical storage that isn’t yet downloaded for offline because I haven’t noticed. I shouldn’t have to do this to begin with.

- Pre-saving unreleased music is bad. Really bad. I once saved an album that had only 4 singles out at the time, with the rest of the album “available for download,” having the rest of the tracks grayed out. Standard stuff. You would think that when the album came out it would download the rest of the songs and I would be good to go. Nope. The album came out, and I still, to this day, have a pre-release album saved instead of the actual full album. I click the album and those same 4 songs are available with the rest grayed out. I have to actually go to the artist page and save the other album (even though they appear the same)... why have a prerelease album with limited content when the full album is out? 

I have a couple more issues, but after putting so much effort into migrating from Spotify long ago only to still have all these issues I can’t think of them. 

I’m wondering if I am the only one with these issues since Apple Music continues to break records for music streaming. Maybe I’m a power user when most average users don’t encounter these issues?

Is the issue with the artists/labels sometimes? Maybe my means of listening? My car? My AirPods? I only ask because, well, obviously it really annoying, but also because I don’t remember having these issues with Spotify. Maybe I did and just forgot, though...",236,664,2018-05-09,AAPL,0.04837803170084953,0.922402024269104,0.029220014810562134

apple,"The AppleTV 4K might not have all of the features of other media players, but the streaming quality has consistently been better.","BACKGROUND: I've extensively tested out a few different media center boxes for the past month, including the Xbox One S, Chromecast 4K, PS4, Roku 4K. I didn't get my hands on a Nvidia Shield, unfortunately. The setup was the same for all devices: hooked up to a Vizio M65 (2017 model) through a Denon X2300W with HDR (it's also Dolby Vision capable). I used ethernet when possible and I've got gigabit fiber, so theoretically there aren't any network limitations. I made sure there were no firewall issues as well. 

-----

FINDINGS: The AppleTV consistently had the best streaming quality across all apps. While the AppleTV 4K might not have all of the features out there (no Atmos or DTS passthrough, no 4K HDR Youtube [yet], etc.), the features it does have are implemented incredibly well. 

-----

From Fox Sports to Hulu to Netflix to MLB, the AppleTV's picture is consistently sharper and smoother streaming than the other boxes. Audio quality also is better for Fox Sports (GO BRAVES!), DirecTV Now, and FX Now. Plex also works more smoothly when streaming 4K HDR (but quality and features across Plex apps varies more than other apps, so take that with a grain of salt). Other media boxes also have to constantly switch the TV panel mode between SDR and HDR depending on the content, but the AppleTV never needs to do that, probably because the OS runs in HDR. 

-----

CONCLUSION: Maybe Apple is forcing higher standards on tvOS developers than the other device makers do, or maybe Apple just has a better OS? I haven't seen any reviews discuss this, and I was wondering if anyone's experience is the same as mine!",101,268,2018-05-11,AAPL,0.0186820849776268,0.8914976716041565,0.08982020616531372

apple,"[Self Promotion Saturday] Hey, I released a big update to my Reddit app for iOS Apollo. Would love to know what you think, what you'd like to see going forward, etc.!","Hey friends, back when I first released Apollo [I made a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/787rtu/introducing_apollo_a_brand_new_reddit_experience/) and the amount of love and feedback you gave it blew me away. I just released its biggest update since its inception (1.2), so I wanted to make another post to talk with the iOS/Apple community at large again and hear your thoughts if you're willing to share!

Here's a [download link](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), a [little 1.2 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJPP0S9gdyI) and a [full changelog](https://gist.github.com/christianselig/840771053027ecfddabdcbcb0c750d9e).

The 1.2 update was focused on all the requests you all brought since the initial release. I catalogued the biggest feature requests (as well as annoying bugs) and set to make that the focus for the update, so it included a lot of goodies like an awesome comment jump button, a GIF progress bar, even faster media loading, open in external apps, and a ton more.

So for those of you who downloaded it, what do you think of the update? What would you like to see in future releases? Anything big missing for you?

(To give you a brief look into my current plans for the future, I'm looking to add a really awesome notification system as part of 1.3, and then after that a ground-up rebuild of the iPad app for 2.0 to take it to the next level.)

Really, thank you, you've brought my creation from something that I initially built to scratch an itch, to something I'm now working on full-time. Apollo's always been a community project at heart throughout its beta process, and I really want to keep it that way, so I'd love to know your thoughts, if you ever want an AMA or anything, biggest wishes for the app, etc. Let me know!

So I come back at 5 and 3 times get told “we’re just doing our final diagnostic check it’ll be out in 5-10 minutes.” Now it’s 5:30, and I’m starting to get a little annoyed because they said it would be done by 5, and my mom hates malls so she’s getting a little pissed as well. Finally, a super nice lady comes out and hands me a brand new 6S and said “You’re original phone kept failing our diagnostic test so here’s a new phone. We’re also going to waive the Cost because you’ve been waiting so long.” So Apple, you just won a lifelong customer in a 13 year old.

apple,It's been almost 7 years since Tim Cook took over. How does everyone think he's doing? (My own thoughts in description) TL;DR at the end.,"Put simply, I've been let down. And yes I know I'll be downvoted to hell for this. But I I know where I'm coming from. 

Just to put into perspective my adoration of Apple: every year I fly to Texas to watch WWDC with my dad. It's our super bowl and we've been lifelong fans. I'm no hater. 

Tim Cook did incredibe work with Apple's supply chain. Example: when you buy a product it was most likely manufactured a week prior. That's incredible, and why Steve Jobs hired him from Compaq. 

But he's not a visionary leader. 

To me it feels like Apple has been treading water and has become too focused on turning a profit. Apple used to provide features that you couldn't live without. Features that seemed so obvious it was incredible that it hadn't been thought of before. But, to me, that's been greatly diminished. 

I wanted to give some time before I really started to see Tim Cook's Apple as solely his vision because tech companies usually work several years out. Now that it's been 7 years I think it's fair to say that everything coming out of Apple has been purely under Tim Cook's leadership. 

Let's look at iPhone 8. 

Outside of advancements to Portrait Mode, the only usable differences are fast charging and wireless charging. Both of these features require a separate purchase which isn't inexpensive. Other manufacturers have implemented these features while including the fast charger and aren't nearly as profitable as Apple. They could've included the fast charging easily, but didn't, especially considering the minor price increase. 

Okay so iPhone X then. $999 and still doesn't come with the fast charger. To me that's ridiculous. Unfathomable in my opinion. 

But beyond the edge to edge screen, which I personally don't believe adds functionality (yet does look better if you don't mind the notch) is really only distinguished by Face ID and the Facial Regonition tech, which is great technology. How was this tech used outside of unlocking your phone? 

Animoji. Yawn. Hopefully this changes with iOS 12. 

I'm sure it's a fun feature for some people, but does it change the way you use your phone? Does it make you think ""Wow. I can't believe this hasn't been done before""? No. If you think Animoji does this please let me know with a respectful comment (legitimately curious). 

Apple has a feature that can tell your face apart from anyone else's and they use it to have a chicken talk for you. I'm sorry but eye roll. 

They could've done something incredible like a ""For Your Eyes Only"" feature where sensitive notes, messages, and/or photos are hidden unless you're looking at the phone. But instead we got ponies with facial expressions. 

Then we can jump to a list of more quick-fire issues:

1. Butterfly Keyboard. 
2. iOS 11 Bugs at launch.
3. Unnecessarily working on TV shows. (Unless they do something seriously revolutionary here this seems like a waste.)
4. Price hikes on new products (Apple TV 4K, Apple Watch Series 3, iPhone 8, MacBook Pro with Touch Bar)
5. The Mac Pro (""Can't innovate my ass"" --&gt; Five years later saying they were wrong)
6. Siri becoming embarrassingly far beyond competition.
7. HomePod (lagging because Siri is falling behind, and a personal reason. Literally not once have I been able to ask Siri to play a song and she actually picks the one I want. For some reason she always decides to choose something that's not in my library and instead picks a random song on Apple Music with a somewhat similar title. I'm not exaggerating, not once has this worked, but to be fair I also listen primarily to House which she might not be tailored for). 

With all this I've become more concerned about Apple becoming (still a huge company) a standard tech company compared to their past. 

To be fair here's some things I've enjoyed, although some might be leftovers from the Jobs era. 

1. Airpods. 
2. iCloud Continuity
3. 3D Touch
4. Apple Music (it's the only streaming service that syncs up with all the music I've bought on iTunes which is where I buy all my music.)
5. Large screen iPhones (but that was going to have to happen eventually.)
6. In-house chip development. (Tim Cook has apparently been spending a lot on R&amp;D and this is a big part of that. So far the A-Series chips have been [to quote Steve Jobs] ""blow away"" . Very impressive stuff.)
7. Apple Pay
8. Taptic Engine (minor but enjoyable) 

Please let me know your thoughts, but I do ask to keep it respectful and not fanboy-y. I truly want to know how people feel about Tim Cook's Apple and if they think it's a good direction for Apple. And most importantly please share why. 

TL;DR: I feel like Apple under Tim Cook has lost their way and I want to know how the Apple subreddit feels. 

Edit: Thanks for all the positive responses! 

Wanted to clarify the ""For Your Eyes Only"" feature. Seems I didn't explain it clearly. 

Current functions like notifications only showing previews while the owner looks at the phone and locking notes are remnants of preexisting Touch ID functionality. What I want to see is redacted information unless the owner is looking at the phone. Rather than lock a note, it's completely hidden and out of sight. Do you have an email with sensitive company information? It's hidden unless you are looking at your phone. Don't want your girlfriend to see the note about your engagement plans? Hide the note except from yourself. Hopefully this clears up my intention.",1178,2834,2018-05-14,AAPL,0.037529414519667625,0.9324360489845276,0.030034528113901615

apple,Has your MacBook battery life become much worse in the last week or two? New Zero-Day Mac CPU virus,"**EDIT**

Sorry guys, got a few things wrong. This is not a [virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus), it is most likely [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) (the difference being that it doesn't duplicate and spread itself). It's also not a zero-day exploit (as a result of it not being a new vulnerability that the malware is exploiting). It's still annoying though lol.

---

This has bitten me as well as a quite a few others; and it appears to have been getting worse in the last couple of days alone. I've always been very security conscious so getting this was a surprise, but I just noticed I was losing battery life much more quickly than usual and only found out after checking Activity Monitor to find the culprit wasn't appearing in the ""Energy"" tab.

### How to find out whether you're infected
Open Activity Monitor to the `CPU` tab and sort by the processes using the highest CPU. If you see one called `mshelper` using a lot of your system resources; you're infected.

### What it does
There's good news and bad news here. The bad news is that it's currently uncertain what it's using the CPU for (though let's be reasonable, it's probably cryptocurrency mining or something). The good news is that is probably all it's doing and not stealing/encrypting any of your files. 

### How to remove it
Unfortunately you can't just force quit the `mshelper` process as it'll restart itself. Apple will likely release a full security fix in the next week or two, but in the meantime you need to delete the following two files:

1. `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.pplauncher.plist`
2. `/Library/Application Support/pplauncher/pplauncher`

And then restart your system. If you check your CPU resources and see it's no longer there, congrats! You're no longer infected.

apple,How to make the Touch Bar Useful.,"So i bought my 15"" MBP touch bar in September. i liked the touch bar for like 2 days. then i realized i don't use it. it just looks good but it's useless.
 
I found out about a tool named BettertouchTool. it was a little hard to use and to find good scripts for it so i forgot about it.

Until 3 days ago someone posted this a link for this Article

[Making the Touch Bar finally useful
](http://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/)

And i fall in love again with the touch bar. you can add gestures, folders, functions, scripts and shortcuts to any thing you need on the touch bar with this tool.

There are already made presets you can get from [here](https://github.com/vas3k/btt-touchbar-presets) you can use for your Touch Bar. in my case i made my own preset with all the scripts i need. 

And here it is my setup 

https://imgur.com/a/x5rLIoT

https://imgur.com/a/UyHTYfn

1- ESC button. of course...

2- A group button that includes brightness, keyboard light and sound buttons

It also shows your ip address, cpu usage, ram usage, battery level and how many time left for charge/discharge and a Quit All button that quits all the running apps.

https://imgur.com/xkQYeli

3- I use Windows 10 on Parallels every day so i made a button for it so i can now start windows 10 from the Touch Bar.

4- A finder button for instant access to Finder

5- Volume buttons

6- Day and time, you can change it to the format you like. when you click it, it opens a clock app.

7- Weather

8- An app folder in my name. it includes buttons for the apps i use everyday, the office button is actually a folder that has Microsoft office apps. 

https://imgur.com/a/WTloHIL

9- Spotlight

10- Siri

11- Notifications Bar

For the scripts 

i am using scripts to show what is playing in iTunes, Vox &amp; Spotify. when something is playing a Play/Pause button and Next,  previous buttons appear so you can control the music.

i also use a script to show the name of the video running on youtube on google chrome. you can also find a script for safari.

i added scripts to show me if there is any reminders in the reminders app or next events in fantastical 2 app.

https://imgur.com/a/UKp2cNu

I plan to add many stuff soon when i finish my exams. there is a lot more to do! first of them is adding a folder that includes some functions like screenshot, sleep, shut down, restart, wifi on/off, etc

all the scripts are available here
https://github.com/vas3k/btt-touchbar-presets

iphone,Ringtones that will use the maximum potential of your speakers.,"Hey fellas!

Recently, I bought an iPhone X and felt like the speakers potential is not used enough. Or it is, but the factory content that is provided is somehow quiet for my needs. I'm a sound designer and a synth addict and I love loud space engines, powerful gunshots, 808, weird harmonics and chord progressions, so out of curiosity I decided to create some ringtones and obtain the loudness that the speakers can provide.

What I did was I tested the frequency range of the iPhone X speakers and designed sounds with a specific EQ and limiter that will match the exact maximum and needed power. To elaborate a bit, with a pink noise I checked the frequencies on which the X is distorting and leveled them with EQ, while boosting the other ones where the loudness is safer and can play louder frequencies.

All of the content is exclusive and free \(and loud\), and my idea is to release a bundles, depending on the creativity and inspiration.

So, head over to [https://ilijac.com/extras/](https://ilijac.com/extras/) and let me know what you think! :\) with the Reddit app, the page is zoomed in, you just have to zoom out and you can scroll over the content.

Thanks!

Valve appealed, explaining the Steam Link app simply functions as a LAN-based remote desktop similar to numerous remote desktop applications already available on the App Store.

iphone,I’ve been using an iPhone X without a case for over 6 months. Here is what it looks like.,"So briefly about my usage: 

I used the X as a main device, so everyday for everything like calls internet, chats etc. I sometimes carry another phone with me as a backup or for whatever reason but since I got the X it has been pretty much the only phone I used. 

I drive a lot (at least 2-3 trips a day) and work in an office, I also go to the gym almost every day. (I have a bumper case for the gym but I’ve only used it for the first few months and don’t anymore) I use my phone in all those situations for music/navigation etc. 

I rarely have any battery left at the end of the day so I’m a heavy user you might say. 

I try to be careful with my phones: I’ll never put it in a pocket with something else for example etc. but I do occasionally drop them (my 4 had a cracked screen and so did the 5s). I dropped the X a few times and remarkably only one of them had left a mark (two) on the side. I’d say I’m a 3,5/5 for being careful with my phone overall. (1 being playing football with it, 5 being handling it with velvet gloves on). 

So here are the results of my usage without the case: 

[The iPhone X under direct sunlight (more more scratchy details)](https://imgur.com/a/uCI7Apk/)

[The iPhone X indoor pictures (how it normally looks like)](https://imgur.com/a/tUB2TRv/)

[The iPhone 7s Plus, previous phone for comparison, 6 months usage and actually a lot of that in a pouch case ](https://imgur.com/a/U4KlQul/)

As you can see the results are pretty remarkable. The X is very durable to scratches compared to the other smartphones I’ve used before (and I’ve used a lot of them) and it’s actually quite shatter resistant from my experience also. Did you know that the glass on the iPhone X is 1.5 times thicker than on previous models? The stainless steel frame also holds against scratches or scuffs very well(huge problem on previous aluminum iPhones) although this is only true for the space grey version, I’m not sure why. 

I’ve never liked using a case for the phone. I get all the advantages but I feel like you aren’t using the true advantages of design and feel. To me it feels like buying a really pretty car and wrapping it in ugly plastic so that it doesn’t get scuffed or scratched. I like my phone to feel premium, slim and light. So I’ve never used a case, and mostly it was always fine. (7s is an exception because that jet black is ridiculous, it even got badly scratched with the case smh)

The point of this isn’t to convince people to not wear cases, but if you were wondering what it could be like, you have your answer.",151,419,2018-05-25,AAPL,0.05603640526533127,0.9103989601135254,0.033564671874046326

&gt;Thank you for your email and being a customer of Apple products and the App Store.

&gt;We care deeply about bringing great games to all of our users on the App Store. We would love for Valve’s games and services to be on iOS and AppleTV.

&gt;Unfortunately, the review team found that Valve’s Steam iOS app, as currently submitted, violates a number of guidelines around user generated content, in-app purchases, content codes, etc. We’ve discussed these issues with Valve and will continue to work with them to help bring the Steam experience to iOS and AppleTV in a way that complies with the store’s guidelines.

&gt;We put great effort into creating an App Store that provides the very best experience for everyone. We have clear guidelines that all developers must follow in order to ensure the App Store is a safe place for all users and a fair opportunity for all developers. 

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;Phil

* A notification will arrive on one device but not the others
* A notification will arrive on two devices but not the third (often the iPad)
* A notification arrives on all devices. If I open Messages on my Mac and read the message, the notification will persist on my iPhone
* A notification arrives on all devices. If I open Messages on my iPhone and read the message, the notification will persist on my Mac
* If I send a message on my Mac, the message won't appear in the thread on my iPhone or iPad
* Similarly, if I send a message on my iPhone, it sometimes doesn't appear in the thread on my iPad or Mac
* Messages will often appear out of order (I know this is a known issue)
* A notification will sometimes arrive on one device, and then arrive on the second and/or third device after a delay of a few seconds to over a minute
* Sometimes won't receive a notification at all for a new message (often on my Mac)
* I will send a message on my Mac and it will show as ""not delivered"", even though it actually was delivered and appears in the thread on my iPhone

And sometimes everything works just fine.

I can confirm that I only have a single Apple ID on each device, and that it's the same on every device.

Might this be because I'm using the Public Beta on my iPhone? I've tried resetting iMessage on each device and nothing changes.",103,238,2018-05-26,AAPL,0.07162459194660187,0.9037437438964844,0.024631669744849205

iphone,Weird iPhone recorded conversation over Bluetooth,"Tldr, new iPhone started playing the audio of a conversation over car Bluetooth that was had on it the day before from no discoverable source within the phone, only stopped with initiation of a call. Where was it playing from and how/why was it recorded?

Story: finally convinced GF to get her first iPhone (8 Plus) a couple days ago. Yay blue text. Last night I'm driving her car, we're listening to music on my iPhone X via USB connection, hers is connected via Bluetooth to the dash. 

She had just finished watching a video of her nephew on her phone when all of a sudden my USB music gets muted and the car Bluetooth acts as if it's in an active phone call playing audio over the speakers of a phone conversation she had the day before with her girlfriend. I'm hearing both ends of their conversation. Somehow their conversation was recorded and is now being played back.

I take her phone and look in her phone app, there's no active call, no voicemail being played back, the control center doesn't show an active pause-able media being played. On her Bluetooth display it's showing as if it's an active ongoing call. We try clicking ""end call"" on the car screen but nothing. I finally terminated it by going into her phone and initiating a call to me. 

So where was this coming from? And why the hell was her entire phone call somehow recorded? We're both really confused and she's freaked out about ""iPhones and privacy"" now. 

Edit to add details, it was on T-Mobile in a Toyota Scion. As someone else suggested, I almost wonder if it was the car and not the iPhone since the phone had no indication it was putting out any audio or engaged in a call, but I'm still baffled. She's had the car about 6 months and nothing like this ever happened on her POS Android. 

Edit 2: she went through her voicemails and found that the call was recorded/saved in her voicemail. Sounds like carrier T-Mobile thing? And she is the one who made the call, so not like she answered a call as it was getting sent to VM. And doesn't explain how when I went into her phone app it wasn't showing it was playing a voicemail and she denies having been in her voicemail prior to the event but.. 🤷🏼‍♂️",96,529,2018-05-28,AAPL,0.04481535777449608,0.9283104538917542,0.026874152943491936

apple,"Messages in iCloud is E2E encrypted, but Apple may still have access","Apple recently updated their [iCloud security overview article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303) to clarify how Messages in iCloud encryption works. Here’s the excerpt:

&gt;	Messages in iCloud also uses end-to-end encryption. If you have iCloud Backup turned on, a copy of the key protecting your Messages is included in your backup. This ensures you can recover your Messages if you've lost access to iCloud Keychain and your trusted devices. When you turn off iCloud Backup, a new key is generated on your device to protect future messages and it is not stored by Apple.

Essentially, all your messages are encrypted by a key generated using your device’s passcode and are inaccessible to Apple and third parties. BUT, if iCloud Backup is turned on, that key is included in the backup and can be accessed by Apple if served a warrant by law enforcement. It also appears that a copy of the key is stored in iCloud Keychain, which itself is secured by your device’s passcode. To keep your message history unreadable to anyone but you, iCloud Backup must be disabled.

With Messages in iCloud disabed, all your messages are included in iCloud backups, so this is at least a bit more secure than that.

TL;DR: Messages in iCloud is completely secure as long as you turn off iCloud Backup.

Edit: Backups are also encrypted of course, but that encryption can be reversed by Apple since they hold the encryption keys. End-to-end encryption means only you hold the encryption keys.

Edit 2: Some people seem to think that Messages in iCloud has made messages more vulnerable. This is not the case. Your messages were just as exposed in your backups before iOS 11.4. **Messages in iCloud is protected from law enforcement, iCloud Backup isn’t and never was.** Messages were always part of backups so they were always vulnerable if you had iCloud Backup turned on.",167,432,2018-05-30,AAPL,0.1050715520977974,0.8733248114585876,0.021603602916002274

For many years now, iOS has offered an option in the Passcode section of the Settings all: “Erase all data on this iPhone after 10 failed passcode attempts.”
...
but it turns out this feature is far more clever than I realized, and it’s highly unlikely that your kids or jackass drinking buddies could ever trigger it. After the 5th failed attempt, iOS requires a 1-minute timeout before you can try again. During this timeout the only thing you can do is place an emergency call to 911. After the 6th attempt, you get a 5-minute timeout. After the 7th, 15 minutes. These timeouts escalate such that it would take over 3 hours to enter 10 incorrect passcodes.

apple,Xiaomi Mi 8 has been revealed and it’s a blatant copy of the iPhone X.,"[Can you tell which is which?](https://imgur.com/gallery/vLTzK3Q) 

We all know that other companies putting out designs that are similar to Apple’s is nothing new, but this is one of the most blatant ripoffs of one of Apple’s designs by a somewhat reputable company I’ve ever seen. 

Surely Apple will have to go after them for this. If it were only a similar design, I could see there being a potential case for defending Xiaomi. But not only is the design more than similar (it’s almost identical, down to the camera housing and notch), the marketing style and color scheme are nearly exactly the same as well.

These companies can’t get away with this. I hope Apple takes action. 

edit: I’ll add that even the software was copied. Battery, WiFi, and Signal icons are all in the exact same location and look nearly identical, as well as the time on the lock screen. The writing in the top left, if it is displaying the carrier name, is a copy as well. Wow.

Messages in iCloud is a new feature that allows iCloud to keep your entire message history updated and available on all your devices. Even when you set up a brand-new device. 

**What should I know?**

* You need to update to the latest iOS version (iOS 11.4), and macOS (10.13.5, whenever it comes out) in order to have this feature. 

* Your messages will take up iCloud space just as if you are syncing Photos, Notes, Contacts and etc

* When you delete a message, photo, or conversation on one device, it’s removed from all of your devices. 

* You need to have the Apple ID in iMessage match the Apple ID being used for iCloud. It doesn't need to match the iTunes/App Store ID. 

* You need 2FA enabled. Link to Apple's article about 2FA: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204915

* Messages in iCloud is turned off by default. You can turn it on by going to Settings -&gt; Tap your name at the top -&gt; iCloud -&gt; Messages

* It is best to leave your devices to sync overnight while they are plugged in. 

* If nothing works, sign out and sign in to iCloud and then sign out and sign in to iMessage.

iphone,"It's 2018, and we still can't swipe away the call screen.","I'm sure this is complained about a lot. But why is it that I have to stop what I'm doing to let a call ring, or decline it? It's so annoying that there's no way around it besides declining the call or keeping Do Not Disturb on constantly. 

I wish this was something Apple addressed. Should've been *years* ago.",70,280,2018-05-31,AAPL,0.1505180150270462,0.815593957901001,0.033888086676597595
