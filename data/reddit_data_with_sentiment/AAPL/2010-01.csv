What are my options? I'd prefer to avoid AT&amp;T if possible... can I go with Verizon, or T-Mobile? My phone is already jailbroken, will I have to ""unlock"" it? If I stay with AT&amp;T can I keep my old phone #? Note that I'm in the U.S.

Ideally:

* no contract, or at least a short one
* unlimited data
* cheap
* not AT&amp;T

I perform this drag and drop action to the dictionary icon hundreds of times a day--mostly because I want to be able to jump to wikipedia. The other ways of accessing Dictionary (ctr + cmd + d, etc.) aren't as useful for me. 

Huge appreciation to anyone who has any idea how to deal with this, even it means reinstalling dictionary.app (if that can be done selectively?). Thanks.

EDIT: MANY thanks to all those helped. I've just performed a complete reinstall. Now the drag-drop function is back. And now I have a total nightmare on my hands trying to restore all my old data. I guess this is what happens when one gets obsessive about some minor function. 

I still don't know what caused it. I tried verifying everything to do with Dictionary.app through Pacifist. No luck.

iphone,How to Jailbreak. An easy step-by-step guide.,"I wrote this for someone on facebook, thought reddit might like it as well.

Note: iPod, iPod touch, and iPhone are (for all intents and purposes) synonymous in this guide. It works for any of the above.

Enjoy, reddit.

**EDIT**: Misc changes.
**EDIT 2**: Changed Appulo.us and iPhonecake to Apptrackr.

~

**Here’s a step-by-step on how to jailbreak your iTouch and get some of the cool shit that comes along with it.**

**This is assuming that you have the 3.1.2 Apple firmware, as 3.1.3 does not have a jailbreak.

**Note: before we get started, if you have the iPod Touch 3g, it's a tethered jailbreak. Meaning if you ever hold down the power button and slide to power off or the batteries run out, you have to jail break it again. (You won't lose any of your apps, music or settings.)**

**Jailbreaking:**

1. Browse to http://blackra1n.com/ and download whichever version (Mac or PC) your computer uses.

2. Connect the iPod to your computer.

3. *Make sure it’s not syncing.*

4. Activate the blackra1n program.

5. Click “Make it ra1n.”

After a few seconds, it should pop up with a message that your iPod has been jailbroken. Disconnect it and let the iPod reboot.

(**At this point, if your iPod has a spinning circle on the home screen for more than 30 seconds, hold down the home and power buttons for 15 seconds, which will restart the iPod. This happened to me, it wasn’t a big deal, just re-jailbreak it.**)

At this point, you should see an app called “blackra1n” on your iPod.

**Installing Cydia:**

(Cydia is an application that works much like the App Store, except all the applications are ones that Apple did not approve.)

1. Open it.

2. Click “Cydia”.

3. Click “Install” in the upper right of  the screen.

4. Hit the home button and go open the Cydia application you just installed.

5. You can now download and install apps from here.

(Please note that if you install OpenSSH on your iPod, you must set a new password, else your iPod may be compromised (via hackers or a worm). To do this, follow the simple guide on the Cydia homepage.)

Great Cydia apps to get:

* **SBsettings**
(An app that lets you swipe your finger across the top bar [the one with a clock on it] which will cause a drop down menu to come down that allows you to turn down the brightness, turn wifi on and off, turn bluetooth on, etc.)

* **Backgrounder**
(This lets you minimize apps--something Apple should have implemented a long time ago.)

* **Proswitcher**
(Lets you easily switch between minimized apps)

* **Categories**
(Lets you make folders for apps so your pages are less cluttered.)

* **Winterboard**
(Lets you mess with the appearance of the iPod, change the wallpaper behind your icons, etc.)

And one last big one, Install0us.

Install0us lets you access a database of thousands of cracked apps up for pirating.

**Installing Install0us and Appsync:**

1. Go into Cydia.

2. Hit “Manage” on the bottom bar.

3. Hit “Sources”.

4. Hit “Edit” up in the top right.

5. Click “Add” in the top left.

6. Put this into the box (that’s a zero, not an O):      http://cydia.install0us.com

7. Hit “Add Source”.

(Repeat steps 1-7, but in step 6, put http://cydia.hackulo.us

8. Once it is installed, hit search on the bottom bar and search for and install “install0us”. Then search and install ""Appsync"".

9. Once it is installed, go back to your home screen and open Install0us.

10. Click “settings” on the bottom bar.

11. Change the Home URL to “apptracker.org/m"" (No quotes.) 

12. Exit and restart Install0us.

13. Enjoy free apps.

(Note: as of now, Appulo.us is ridiculously slow. Be patient.)

And, there you go. Jailbroken iPod. 

**If you ever have to send your iPod back to Apple, just un-jailbreak it first. Just hook it up to your computer and hit ""Restore"" in iTunes. Apple can't tell you ever jailbroke it.**

apple,Reddit envelope icon fix,"cross-posting from my own comment in order to pimp some karma (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/anzoa/hey_reddit_did_it_take_you_months_of_using_reddit/c0ik7y8)

A few Redditor found that the little envelope in Reddit is not displayed correctly, so I wrote a temporary fix... basically I saved the ""have mail"" and ""no mail"" icons and converted them to gif, uploaded them to imgur, and wrote a jQuery to replace the original img tags to png with img tags to the my gif's.
To use this, go to GlimmerBlocker, add new rule, with Action = ""Whitelist URL, optionally modifying content"", ""is in domain"" = ""reddit.com"", and put the following script in the javascript tab.

    $("".havemail &gt; img"").remove()
    $("".havemail"").append('&lt;img src=""http://i.imgur.com/2Anoz.gif"" /&gt;')

    $("".nohavemail &gt; img"").remove()
    $("".nohavemail"").append('&lt;img src=""http://imgur.com/6WV6Il.gif"" /&gt;')

my jQuery-fu is kind of limited, so I am sure there are ways to make this better/simpler. Please try this out and let me know if there are ways to improve this!

After I did this, I found that this has been quite extensively discussed already... I guess this is quite common...

**EDIT2** Thanks for all the suggestions! I incorporated the ones from [PaiTrakt](http://www.reddit.com/user/PaiTrakt) and [tvon](http://www.reddit.com/user/tvon) and added them here.

I wanted to bring our favorite imageboards to the iPhone. Safari just doesn't cut it and the only other app was a pale shadow of the real deal. I think I succeeded in a very compelling way but I'll let you be the judge of that.

Anonyma contains full support for 4chan, 420chan, 7chan, 2chan and 99chan, including thread watching and posting. You can take a picture with the iPhone's camera or snag an image with the built-in search feature if what you need isn't in your photo library. Future versions will contain an image editor and other goodies.

Watch the demonstration video at my website -- http://www.anonapp.com/

All imageboards on these websites are available in Anonyma but some are not visible by default for obvious reasons. If you don't see it, you can probably add it! But don't hold me responsible for content on the boards you choose to view!

Any other websites you'd like to see in Anonyma? Did I overlook a killer feature? Post it here and I'll do my best!

Have a great Monday, Reddit, and maybe I'll see you on the boards...

EDIT: I guess I should mention that the promo codes only work in the US! Sorry foreigners! (Unfortunately, I am one of you and know the pain all too well.)

There are your standards:

* option e and option ~ prouduce ´and `
* option i makes an ˆ
* option u makes any band more hardcöre with an ¨
* option o makes it easy to write letters to those in Sweden about their Møøse infestation

You'll also find different degrees of success with option zero for º as well as option 2 for ™ and option r for ®. It's strange that Apple isn't more pro-copyright with option c - it makes a ç instead of an ©. That's relegated to option g (as in god damn it, RIAA. Wtf?)

Throughout your QWERTY keyboard you'll also find œ∑†¥πåß∂ƒ˙∆˚¬…æΩ≈√∫˜µ≤≥÷ as well as ¡¢∞§¶•ª on your numeric keys.

Throwing these keys into documents and correspondence as required makes you look smart, professional, and (for those who labour with ASCII codes) like you've got a brilliant memory. I use them regularly every day (writing Bluetooth® over and over with ALT+0174 (I think) would get tiresome).

apple,What made you switch to (or start using) Apple computers?,"I've been using Macs on and off since the Apple IIGS back in elementary school, but it wasn't until I bought an early Mini that I actually owned one. 

As configured it was basically just an expensive paperweight (1.2GHz with 256MB of RAM). Even with the RAM upgraded it still wasn't particularly useful. I can't say I've spent more then a handful of hours on it. Web browsing was out of the question, and even text entry was laggy at times. My 1.4Ghz Athlon machine ran circles around my Mini. It really put me off of Apple hardware for a while. 

I was given a Core2Duo Toshiba laptop a couple years back and it served it's purpose. I just couldn’t take it to class because its fan control. Even with the CPU throttled down as much as Vista (even XP) would allow, and the second core disabled in the BIOS, the cooling fans would come on full blast for a second or two, then go back to back to a reasonable level for about a minute before repeating the process. The fans were loud too. When they came on it was audible to the whole class, and it was embarrassing. Everyone else’s was silent. I searched for a while and found countless others with my problem. Turns out Toshiba wrote really shitty power management drivers, and the fan control for this particular model was hard-coded in the BIOS. There was no gradual speed; just full blast, or ""off"". Battery life was about an hour and a half.

Around the same time as this, something called the EFI patch came out of the OSX86 project. What this allowed was for retail copies of OS X to be installed on non-apple hardware. I had a Leopard disk lying around and figured I would try it out. It installed and worked pretty much out of the box on my PC, and I used it on and off for a while. It allowed me to get a good feel of what OS X was actually capable of with out me starting at the spinning beach ball for hours.

I got an iPhone, and to me this was the deciding factor. While the OS on the iPhone is fairly limited, the software is top-notch. I still haven't seen a phone with the same organic feel that the UI has in the iPhone.

So I bought a Macbook Pro to replace my Toshiba, and I love it. I appreciate how the same company makes both the hardware and software, and both aspects are top notch. Everything about it just seems well thought out. Even though I have a quad-core gaming machine sitting next to me, I find myself spending most my time on my Macbook Pro. I love the trackpad gestures too.

Questions that I have about doing it: Would I still be able to use apps purchased through the app store? Is it easy to restore to normal if I do not like.

Any insight would be really helpful, still having doubts - but hoping the hive mind can help out.

iphone,SMS delivery notification (useful in areas with poor service),"You know the sound the phone makes when you send an SMS? The little ""boop"" sound (haha). I like it because when I am texting from apps like tlert or biteSMS, it verifies that the text was sent. This is useful for me in areas where I have poor service as a verification.  Why do I need this? Because I have often sent a text, then gone back hours later to see that it never sent. This is due to a combination of poor service in certain areas and the fact that I usually keep the ringer switch set to vibrate.


I searched a long time trying to find something that would make my phone vibrate when the message was sent, but couldn't find anything, so I went into the files and figured it myself. 


I did this all in iFile, because it was way easier then through SSH - but you can do either one.


1.) open iFile/SSH into your phone.

2.) Go to System&gt;Library&gt;PrivateFrameworks&gt;Celestial.Framework and open the file ""SystemSoundBehaviors.plist""

3.)* Scroll down to:


      &lt;key&gt;SMSSent&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;dict&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;RingVibrateIgnore,SilentVibrateIgnore,RingerSwitchOff&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;array/&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;RingVibrateIgnore,SilentVibrateIgnore,RingerSwitchOn&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;array&gt;
          &lt;string&gt;Beep&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
      &lt;/dict&gt;


You will want to change this to:


    &lt;key&gt;SMSSent&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;dict&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;RingVibrateIgnore,SilentVibrateIgnore,RingerSwitchOff&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;Vibrate&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;RingVibrateIgnore,SilentVibrateIgnore,RingerSwitchOn&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;array&gt;
          &lt;string&gt;Beep&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
      &lt;/dict&gt;


4.) Save the file, and reboot your phone.

5.) It may not work right away; it actually took a day or two to take affect on my phone, but is working now. It a nice verification system. 



**
There are all other sorts of sound behaviors that you look at it in there, such as when you flip the ringer switch (whether it vibrates or not).


There are multiple settings for each action. Look at the keys: Ring or Vibrate? Or ignore? Silent or Vibrate? Or ignore. Is the ringer switch on or off? Or ignore? 
**

(Edit) Does anybody know how to paste text and keep the formatting/spacing of it? For the code.

apple,TOMT for Mac users: a utility that shows you what files have changed after installing a program,"Hoping you guys can come through for me. Back in the OS 9 days, this utility would build a simple index of your startup drive, then, after installing something, would show a list of what files were added/changed and where they were. It was called something obvious like ""Installer Watcher.""

All my googling powers have wrought nothing. I need this because I have an audio card (M-Audio delta 410) that requires a POS driver which prevents deep sleep on older macs. I'm hoping to find an easy way to 'hack' the install for a single user, so that I can log out to another account if I want to have sound. Or some godawful solution like that.

Seems like a simple utility like this should be a no brainer but I can't find it. Otherwise i wonder if anyone knows a command line way to compare changes on a disc on a directory level. hope this makes sense.

Thanks reddit!

apple,My experience with Time Machine,"Like many of you Mac users (maybe), I have been using Time Machine pretty much since it was introduced by Apple. This last Wednesday was, unfortunately, the first time I had to use it for anything other than a wow-session for other people.

I started noticing weird behavior on my machine, so I restarted it. When the Apple logo appeared, a tiny progress bar showed across the bottom. It tried two times, going about half way both times before quitting. After the second try, the machine would just shut down.

So, I FSCK'ed it and received a 'bad node' warning. Go grab the Snow Leopard Disc, pop it in and boot from that. When I get into it, I go into Disk Utility and check the HD. It finds the bad node and tells me that the only way to fix it is to reformat and reinstall. 
This stresses me, but I had *just* updated my backup that morning (I do it infrequently since updating through Wireless G on my MBP is painful). So, I zero out the HD.

At this point, I know I should be able to use my Time Machine disk image as the reference image, so I click over in Disk Utility to recover and select it as the source image. Then I tried dragging the computer's HD to the destination disk and it wouldn't work. This stresses me, but I know it's Apple and it has to be easy, right?

So, one quick search later and I find that the Restore From Time Machine Backup is at the bottom of the menu where you go to get to Disk Utility on the startup DVD! Never frakkin' noticed it before. 

So, I click that, it finds the Time Capsule on the network. 

Then it asks me which date I want to recover from (this is so cool).

I choose the latest date and it grinds and crunches while I go to sleep (9+ hour recovery).

When I wake up, I restart and the machine 99% acts like nothing ever happened. This is pretty amazing. The ONLY thing that didn't retain was my Lil' Snitch preferences for whatever reason.

So, yeah - If you have a Mac, there's no reason to not be using Time Machine.

*TL;DR - First time I've ever had to use Time Machine for an actual emergency - and it worked perfectly.*",96,190,2010-01-24,AAPL,0.08420591056346893,0.885154664516449,0.03063948266208172

1. **File system**: ZFS support (sadly, I don't see this as being in the cards but you never know).
2. **Time Machine**: Encrypted backups. This should be by default.
3. **Time Machine**: More granular control over schedule and selections (advanced mode?).
4. **Uninstaller**: A true application uninstaller similar to Cleanapp or AppZapper.
5. **iTunes**: ""watch"" remote folders such as on a NAS or other external storage without requiring the file itself to imported (pointers in the iTunes db) and update iTunes with newly added songs.. Btw, I am not referring to watching a specific local folder as per this [link](http://lifehacker.com/5356619/itunes-finally-adds-watched-folder-to-automatically-add-new-music).

apple,You have GOT TO BE KIDDING ME RIM!,"**Edit:**
There is a fix for this. I spent a couple of hours playing with it and found that the following works.

1. Unplug your phone, perform a battery pull.
2. Quit BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
3. Delete the OS file in You/Library/Application Support/Blackberry Desktop Manager/
4. Plug the phone back in with the battery in.
5. BlackBerry DM will launch and churn for 5 or 6 minutes, waiting for the device to connect. It'll use an ungodly amount of your processor.
6. After 5 or 6 minutes of apparently doing nothing, you'll be prompted for your password. Put it in.
7. BB DM will say you need to download and install the OS.
8. Do so, it takes 10 minutes. Then restore from a backup.

So it looks like you **can** do a system restore, but only by tricking the software into thinking it's a new device or something. The caveat is that your phone won't have third party stuff installed, and you can't install most of it from BB DM. Yet more broken shit from RIM.

--

Some of us, for whatever reason, use BlackBerry devices. I switched from an iPhone because I commute regularly and my mobile device has to have one of either a good battery or a replaceable battery, and iPhone don't got neither. But whatever. This isn't about Apple, this is about RIM treating Mac users as third-class citizens.

The BlackBerry Desktop Manager pops up saying that a load of applications can be updated. Some are apps I've installed, and some are system apps like the Messaging app.

""Oh cool!"" naive young me from 20 minutes ago thinks, ""unlike Apple, RIM can update system apps without needing to update the entire OS. That's really efficient!""

So I set it running, went to do my sit-ups before bed and came upstairs to find the following error:

""BlackBerry Desktop Manager could not update your device. Please connect a different device, and try again.""

Aside from the fact that this is a terribly phrased error message, there was a progress bar about 30% of the way across the screen. I know it updated some of the apps, because it was chugging away quietly in the background while I changed into my sexy gym shorts.

I look at the BlackBerry. It's got a white screen, with a tiny icon that reminds me of the iPod sad face. ""Reload Software: 507""

I'm told that this means it's been ""nuked,"" and I'll have to reload the OS.

This is the good part: RIM don't let you do that on OS X. There's no way for you to download the OS and get it onto the phone without running Windows. Don't say that you *can't* do it, because that's not true. It's not a technical impossibility. RIM won't let you. They haven't bothered to invest the time in it because, hey, everyone uses Windows.

So fuck you, RIM. Tomorrow I'm going to be on a train without music to listen to for 3 hours. I won't be able to go to sleep because I can't set an alarm in case I sleep through my stop. I won't be able to use GPS to find the place I'm going, and as soon as I finish typing this, I'm going to go and write out my itinerary... *by hand*.

**Fuck you, RIM.**

**tl;dr**: RIM's shitty Mac software nuked my BlackBerry, but I can't fix it on my Mac because they won't let you restore the BlackBerry OS from anything other than a Windows machine.",42,10,2010-01-26,AAPL,0.06031771004199982,0.9061598181724548,0.033522479236125946

apple,You are wrong about the iPad,"In short, Apple knows what people want way better than you or I do (see: iPod, iPhone). 

I didn’t really appreciate this until I began selling computers to average consumers. Most people (and when I say most, I mean like 80%), come in looking for something they can use to surf the web, email, occasionally write a paper, be able to open office docs, listen to some music, look at pictures, and maybe watch a movie when they travel. That’s it. And there is a huge amount of interest in Apple these days. Those willing to spend $1k almost always get a mac, even if it is overkill for their needs. **Yesterday Apple dropped the price of entry to portable Macs by 50% with a device that does those things specifically, and a few thousand others (the app store), really well.** The people who’ve actually touched the iPad, ie.. not you/me, are all impressed by how well it does these basic things. Imagine how impressed regular folks, think your parents/non-techie friends, will be. All the items people mention that the iPad doesn’t have? Virtually no one comes in asking for that stuff. It is so far down on the list of requested specs, if on the list at all, that it just doesn’t matter. Apple knows this. And they built a very good first gen. device to meet these needs better than existing solutions.

As far as I can tell, people enjoy hating on apple because apple is revered as a very smart company. Finding fault in their products makes people think they are as smart, if not smart than the mighty apple. Well, we’ll see how smart you feel when the iPad sells like crazy.

Apple just had another record in Q4 ’09 (what recession?). I predict, conservatively that Q4 ’10 is 20% higher.
Also... you heard it here first... the iPad will be the christmas gift of 2010.

Now, everyone seems to be bitching because the ipad doesn't do everything in the rumours. Can we try to keep things in proportion?

It is slow, uses too much memory, and generally doesn't add much to websites. New standards allow video to be implemented in different, non-proprietary ways.

apple,Is anyone else not worried about the iPad's initial limitations?,"I fully expect a jailbreak to be out within no time, and we have yet to see what apps will be created to make our lives easier.  When I first heard about the ""device that will change the world"", I assumed it would be a portable remote control computer for your whole home network.  I still have high hopes once the apps hit the market, Remote is currently one of my favorite apps on my phone, and I'm willing to bet the iPad will bring even more.",19,25,2010-01-28,AAPL,0.017758198082447052,0.8207708597183228,0.16147099435329437
apple,"Why the iPad will be a success: my Dad just turned 70 and emailed me  the iPad announcement, saying ""This is really neat. I want this for Christmas"".","What the technorati don't get is that most people are like my Dad: they want to sit in their La-Z-Boys and have a slick, easy-to-use way to browse the Web, show photos, write emails, watch Internet videos, drive their bigscreen TV, read books, play games, and do a bunch of stuff they'd probably never do with their PC. And yes, they want it to look like it's something from the frickin' 21st century, something they don't need to worry about installing virus protection on.

It's funny watching the naysayers complain about the lack of this feature or that and miss the big picture. This isn't a phone, and it isn't a laptop or netbook; it's a new product category. Which is not to say that Apple has invented the tablet, but I think they've figured out how to get the tablet to millions of people that would never otherwise use one.

Yes, the initial iPad is going to have its hardware and software limitations, but there's good reason to assume these will be eased or eliminated in future revs just as has happened and is continuing to happen with the iPhone.

Of course, it's also clear that Apple was running out of time to make big inroads into the ebook reader market. While the Kindle and Nook pale as multifunction devices compared to the iPad, they are clearly establishing themselves as targeted devices for the ebook market. Another 12 - 18 months and their momentum would make the iPad a harder sell.",118,189,2010-01-29,AAPL,0.0437067411839962,0.9209563136100769,0.0353369303047657

iphone,Banner-ad revenue in iPhone applications?,"I'm curious as to whether people (intentionally) click adverts in iPhone applications, inspired by [this submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/auo6j/im_thinking_about_putting_ads_in_my_app_any/)

It seems clicking an advert is a lot of ""effort"", given that it will quit the current application and launch Safari.. I can't imagine many people do this, unless the app is about very specialised subject and the adverts are hand-picked - and usually these specialised apps are made by people who don't have the time/resources to arrange such advertisements..

The only application I regularly use which contains adverts is NetNewsWire, and I've never clicked a single one (despite them generally being substantially less spammy than the ads in many other applications)

[This article](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-to-charge-for-your-iphone-app-ad-revenue-stinks-2009-2) seems to say it's a silly idea, whereas [this one](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/just-how-much-money-can-free-iphone-apps-make-quite-a-bit/) claims applications can make $400-$5000 a day from adverts..?",3,11,2010-01-30,AAPL,0.04703984782099724,0.9277638792991638,0.025196319445967674
apple,I was thinking more about the iPad's lack of web cam everyone is talking about,"Personally, I won't miss it, I've never been a fan of video chats.  They seem to be more disruptive than anything and kill multitasking more than a lack of multitasking in an OS.      

More to the point, I think that they tested it out and in order to frame yourself in a way where the person saw your face and not the ceiling, up your nose, or some other strange shot, you would have to hold the iPad up and out in front of you.  Granted it is fairly light, but I don't think it would be long before your arm got tired and it became more trouble than it was worth.  Keeping it steady would be another issue, the person would get sick watching you shake      

In this type of device, the way it's held doesn't make it conducive to video chats.  This goes with the front facing camera people wanted on the iPhone as well.  You'll use it once, see it is a poor user experience, then never again.  And or course you'll blame Apple for the experience sucking, when really it is just the nature of the device.  That is why they just leave it out.",22,10,2010-01-30,AAPL,0.40364307165145874,0.5745889544487,0.021767958998680115

apple,"Ok after seriously hating on it for a while, I think I've talked myself into wanting an iPad.","The equation goes like this:

Desktop Computer + iPad + VNC app = OMFG I WANT ONE NOW!!!

Imagine having a setup where you can go into VNC mode (or something else if there a better solution for this) and then use your iPad as a full power slate, or a second screen, or even just a large multi-touch track pad. I mean shit, if the 3g connection is good enough I might never leave the VNC app.",38,38,2010-01-31,AAPL,0.0233859084546566,0.9167546033859253,0.05985944718122482

apple,Why the iPad will rule the world,"It allows you to:

* browse the web
* listen to music
* send/receive emails
* read ebooks
* play games
* a shitload of other things once the apps are written for it
* (AKA, 90% of what most people do with their computers)

All with zero configuration, zero managing files, (virtually) no boot time, and an interface so easy my grandma or a 2 year old could figure it out without help.

iphone,What's a good car stereo that won't cost a bazillion $$$ but still works with the iPhone for hands-free?,"I've been researching stereos for a few days, and while there are some amazing new things out there, iPhone support seems spotty at best.  I've looked at the JVC El Kameleon products (with built-in video screens, DVD drives that play DivX AVIs etc, and so on) but they seem to be focused on iPods and hardly anyone says whether or not they charge 2G or 3G iPhones.

I've also found some interesting decks made by a company called ""Eonon"" that I'll probably pass on because they seem to have slow UIs (from the Youtube vids I've seen) even though they've got wicked features.

Kenwood stuff starts above $500 for anything with video, it looks like, so that's frustrating.

So....  what's a good stereo that can do what I want?  
* Bluetooth support for iPhone
* Video screen for backup cam/movies/etc and it can play video from the iPhone
* DVD drive so I can cram a disk of music into it for when the iPhone isn't available or I don't want to mess with iTunes
* Charges both my current 2G iPhone and my upcoming 3G S.

Double DIN is fine, btw, I've got a Pontiac Vibe, the car that looks suspiciously like a Toyota Matrix.

Ideas?
