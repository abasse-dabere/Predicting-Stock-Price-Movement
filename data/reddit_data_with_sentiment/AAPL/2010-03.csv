apple,Leaning toward purchasing a Macbook Pro; how many of you would recommend purchasing Apple Care?,"My PC laptop recently died on me, and so I had been thinking about going the Macbook route since I have never owned a Mac.  I am about 90% sure I will be doing this soon.

I sell technology and one of my customers HIGHLY recommended I get Apple Care since she had seen a not too unlikely history of hard drive failures on the machines at her place of business.  But Apple Care is not exactly cheap.  

I was just hoping to get some reddit opinions on the subject.  Thanks!

iphone,Hey Reddit. My Google Buzz client has gone live.  25 promotional codes for you inside.,"Let me start with a big thank you to everybody for leaving feedback and upvoting the links I submitted about this application. It took me a lot of work to develop it and I still have a lot of features in mind. I didn't do any additional work on it after submitting because, truth to be told, I didn't know if Apple would approve it, so I worked on the Android version in the meantime. I'm working on the next iPhone version as we speak, so don't hesitate to request additional features. Again, thank you, Reddit!

PLEASE, if you use one of the codes, leave a message telling so. That way, other redditors won't need to try every code until they find one that works:

You have one ""magic folder""

You drag and drop a .psd into the magic folder and it automatically gets thrown into your Graphic Design folder.

You drag and drop a .jpg into the Magic Folder and it asks you if you want the file to be thrown into your Pictures folder, or your Graphic Design Folder.

My problem is adding new music to the iPhone. I can't seem to do this without doing an ""erase and sync.""

I'm not asking this to start a discussion about whether Apple makes better products than this or that brand. I'm asking ""what is it about Apple that makes people want to advertise for them?""

The website it took me to had a URL that was an official extension of Apple.com, linked properly to the rest of the Apple site. It asked for my Iphone serial # etc. and upon submission, told me the warrantee was indeed extended. 

Happy and oblivious I post the link to Reddit and send to some friends who do the same until one realizes it's a phishing scam after a search of Symantec. Here's the link: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/apple-iphone-warranty-scam 

Sorry to anyone who may have clicked this - it's very convincing and nothing makes you want to smash heads more then being taken for a ride. Apple support told me that the scam affects them more then the customer who fell for it because they use the serial to set up unauthorized handsets, but it was still a big lesson for me.

iphone,Hey Reddit. We made our first iPhone game. It’s almost ready. Honest! Care to beta test?,"We know, there are tons of iPhone games out there. Who needs another one... Why would you give up your precious time to try something out for us?

Don't really have an answer for you. But you can maybe save your fellow redditors some of their hard-earned money by telling us how bad our game is, and we can fix it before it even ships. How cool is that?

This is a closed beta; we're very concerned about getting the game ""just right"" before we ship. We're interested in hearing your thoughts on the game, what works, what doesn't. 

Goes without saying that you'll get a free copy of the game when it comes out, and our thanks. Send me a PM if you're interested in participating, we'll take the first 20 messages (wonder if we'll get that high?). 

Note that we'll require your device's UDID, and a valid email address to reach you.

Details, details: what's the game about? We call it a SPS: A Side-Person Shooter. It's a 2D ""Scorched Earth""-type game, in real-time.  You can see a trailer on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiFsVgScqtA) or visit our [website](http://www.totemheadz.com) 

(Disclaimer: I have another account here, but I didn't want to tie it to this posting, hence this account.)

**tl;dr:** iPhone game. Fun. Beta testers. Anyone? 

**UPDATE:** Thanks go to the 10 people who have volunteered so far!

**UPDATE #2:** We still have 5 spots open. I'd like to thank everyone who participated, and sorry to everyone who's downvoting this. Hopefully it's because the text above is lame, not because the game isn't appealing.

apple,My external hard drive is dying.  Help me save her.,"I have a LaCie terabyte that I got like six months ago that is starting to act weird.  I have three partitions: Leela (with all my media); Pictures (with every picture I've taken since high school) and Time Machine.  I was in the middle of watching Firefly last night (from Leela), and time machine was backing up.  Then the hard drive suddenly disconnected from my macbook.  I turned it off and on again, all three partitions connected, and I continued watching, but it happened again.  After consulting a friend who is much more experienced than me, he told me to run disk utility.  Well, I couldn't at that time since I could only get one of the partitions to show up again.  I started crying because I thought I had lost all my pictures, and I realized how attached I am to my media.

Finally I got the Pictures partition to connect, and backed up the 42 gigs of pictures I have onto another external hard drive.  So at least that is safe.  I really don't want to lose the rest of my media, that I spent hours collecting and organizing.

I ran disk utility once I finally got all three partitions to connect.  Leela and Pictures are fine, but I got an error message when it came to Time Machine.  My friend told me to get Diskwarrior, which I did, but no serial number to make it work.  

My question is, is it possible just reformat one partition?  I don't care about the time machine backups at all.  Would this even solve my problem?

Alternatively, is there an open source program that will do what Diskwarrior does?

What else would you suggest I do?

let's add $200 for a decent keyboard, mouse, CD-RW drive and a power supply (~$50 each)

How much is the cost of development for OS X? This one is hard to tell but let's take the price of Windows 7 ultimate and half it to $150.

We come out to the total of $1526. Which would leave Apple with $974. This includes putting the computer together, support and marketing as well as brick and mortar stores. 

I think it's important to note that this model came out on March 3, 2009 and it's very possible it will be refreshed soon.

apple,Dr. Jobs or: How I learned to stop worrying and love Apple,"I love my iPhone but I've had problems since day 1.  Dropped calls, missed calls that don't even show up as missed calls unless someone leaves a voicemail, and dropped data streams had been happening to me since I joined AT&amp;T.  I have spent countless hours on the phone with AT&amp;T trying to remedy these problems. Every time I was told I need to get a new phone from apple and a new sim card.  I've now been through 6 phones and sim cards.  The problems kept happening. 
The problems started happening more and more in the last two weeks and had been planning on getting yet another new phone.  On my way into work yesterday my phone dropped out of my pocket (vertical pockets be damned!) and the screen cracked.  Fuck Fuck Fuck. 
I figure I'd go to the Apple store and try to schmooze my way into a new screen for free.  I get to the store explain my consistent problems to the gentleman at the Genius Bar.  After I give him a full run down he asks if I've been restoring my phone from backups every time I get a new one.  I said yes (why wouldn't you, setting it up from scratch is a pain).  He then explained to me that the reason for these issues is likely some weird software problems.  By restoring from backup, the software issues are just put right back onto the phone.  Circular (non) problem solving. 
At this point I showed the genius my cracked screen.  He plugged it into a computer for some diagnosis and saw my crashed apps, dropped calls etc.  He checked my history and verified my story that I've been through a lot of phones.  He then tells me that he's going to replace my screen for free because of all the issues I've had (a $200 value).  I walked out of the store with a fresh screen and a solution to my long running problem. 
Say what you will about Apple's business practices (monopolizing approval of apps, hardware that you can't change or upgrade etc etc) but they treat their customers damn well.

iphone,"Control your phone from your computer using VNC. Send texts, view photos and more.","This is a neat little thing. You must be jailbroken to use this. It's a pretty simple process.


1.) Install Veency from Cydia. I'd also go ahead and install the SBSettings toggle for it.

2.) Download a VNC client for your computer. I use Chicken of the VNC on Mac.

3.) Set a password on your phone if you want through Settings&gt;Veency. If you don't you'll receive a popup every time on your phone asking you to verify the connection.

4.) Open up your VNC client and connect to your phone's IP address (viewable from SBSettings).

5.) Voila.


You can now control your phone through your computer. It is a bit laggy, but still awesome. You can now, say, leave your phone in your pocket and still send/receive texts. Or put your phone in another room, etc etc.


I'd advise installing either KeepAwake (keep your Wifi connection awake even when phone is locked) or AutoLock (prevent phone from locking) to ease the process. They are both SBSettings toggles.

I could easily get a netbook for 300-400 bucks that will give me a browser and some space to put some pictures. I found on Kajiji, someone selling a 16Gb Ipod Touch (2nd gen I believe) for 200 bucks. I would use it as an mp3 player, but I do like the idea of using it also as a communication tool as long as I get a wifi connection. What do you guys think about it?

PS: I already have a Samsung P2, and it seems like an Ipod Touch would not only satisfy the need for a newer mp3 player but also the need to get access to internet to be able to get emails and what not.",27,7,2010-03-17,AAPL,0.013765894807875156,0.9018687009811401,0.08436545729637146

I have had my iPhone for almost two years, and randomly it has stopped connecting to, not only my apartment wifi, but any wfi connection.

I'm really tired of dragging my old black MacBook around and always sweating balls at the possibility of something crashing or getting the Pinwheel of Death in the middle of a performance.

I don't know how hard something like this would be to do, but I'm thinking that if someone could take DJ Traktor Pro, or Traktor Scratch, or Virtual DJ, and port it to the iPad, or if some crazy rad developer wants to do something from scratch, I'd pay good money for it. And I know a lot of people on the scene who are Apple geeks and would do the same. I don't think $100-$200 would be unreasonable for a really good clone of a popular DJ program. Something where you can just drag and drop from your iPod library on the iPad to the program, and sync decks and have a multi-effects panel. All touch controlled.

I have 3 apps in the app store.  Traffic Lights was my first app and I was originally selling it for $0.99.  I raised it to $1.99.  vipValet was my second app.  I raised it from $0.99 to $4.99.  My third app was SpeedR.  I raised it from $0.99 to $14.99.  Between those apps, I had 1-2 sales of each per day.

After I raised the prices, Traffic Lights sold between 0-1 per day.  vipValet averaged 1 every 2 days and SpeedR didn't have any sales at $14.99.

After the first week, I lowered the prices of SpeedR and vipValet.  SpeedR went down to $9.99 and it had 1 sale.  vipValet went down to $2.99 and it stayed the same with 1 sale every 2 days.

3 days ago, I lowered the prices again.  SpeedR went down to $3.99 and vipValet down to $1.99.  Both have been selling at least 1 per day since.

I don't advertise my apps at all, so nothing changed there.  There were no blog posts or anything mentioning my games besides here on reddit.  First thing I learned is that people hate you when your apps are $14.99.  I had several comments on reddit telling me that I'm an asshole for pricing them that much.  Second thing I learned is that I am underpricing my apps.  The reason I say that is I always felt $0.99 was too low, but I didn't want to raise it because I didn't want to offend people or something.  With SpeedR at $2.99 and vipValet at $1.99, I think it's a lot more fair to me.  They're still not expensive but it's reflective of what I think they should be.  That's all subjective and I'm sure some will flip out on me about it.

Either way, I definitely didn't find some insane sales at the higher pricepoints.  I've debated raising SpeedR to $349.99, but I'd feel bad if someone actually purchased it.",10,20,2010-03-21,AAPL,0.07570977509021759,0.8757455348968506,0.048544663935899734

**Purchase a Mac Mini**

[Apple Store](http://apple.com/store)  
[Mac Mall](http://macmall.com)  
Don't forget about the [Apple Refurbished Store](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac), though most of the time there aren't Mac Minis available.  
Make sure that whatever Mac Mini you get/have is [capable of playing high definition (if you'd like that capability)](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/guide/hd/recommendations.html).

**Media Center**

Download and install [Plex](http://www.plexapp.com/). Awesome media center app.  
Download and install [Perian](http://perian.org/). It's a package full of all the codecs you'll need.  
Download and install [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php). Rip your DVDs to your hard drive in an array of different file types.

**Controlling the Media Center with your iPhone**

[Snatch](http://www.hoofien.com/Snatch/). Awesome app that allows you to use your phone as a trackpad, as well as a remote control for Plex. [This article](http://wiki.plexapp.com/index.php/IPhone_Remote) shows you how to make a custom remote screen with a decently attractive theme. Very sweet.  
[Air Video](http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/index.html;jsessionid=F0141ABE4714126F4EF03960B4E4400A). Allows you to stream movies from your Mac Mini to your iPhone, works over 3G (albeit very slowly)!

**Server**

*I highly, **highly** recommend a very strong password on your Mac Mini. Change it often!*  
To use the Mac Mini as a web server you'll need a few things. First, you'll need to be able to reach the Mini from outside your network. I accomplished this by getting a free account at [DynDNS](https://www.dyndns.com/). You can pick from a few free domains, most of them pretty terrible. You'll then need to download and install their free [IP updater client](http://www.dyndns.com/support/clients/). This small app runs in the background and updates your dynamic IP to DynDNS. This way, when you type in your chosen domain name, your DynDNS account will always know to send the request to the correct IP and get the Mac Mini.

Download and install [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html). Very nice web server stack that installs and runs very smoothly.  
*Another option is [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html). -high2plus3*

By default, Apache listens on port 80. Most ISPs block traffic on port 80 (mine did), so you can make Apache listen to a different port by editing your httpd.conf file:

- Open Terminal, at the prompt type:
    sudo vim /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/etc/httpd.conf
- Type your password and you'll be editing the httpd.conf file in *vim*. It looks a little scary, but it's just a command line based text editor.
- Press the down arrow until you come to a line that says, ""Listen 80.""
- Press the letter ""I"" to enter edit mode, now change ""Listen 80"" to ""Listen 8080."" Press Esc to exit insert mode.
- While holding Shift, press Z twice to save and exit.  
There, now Apache is listening on port 8080 and most ISPs will be none the wiser.

Open the XAMPP Control app (in your applications folder / XAMPP) and start all your services. You can quit this app once you've started the services, they don't stop unless you re-open XAMPP Control and stop them manually. Now go to a browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost:8080 – That website is being served from the Mac Mini!


**Torrents**

:) *Keep it legal!*  
Download and install [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/download.php). (People in the comments are saying [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) works as well.)  
In the preferences for Transmission select the ""Remote"" tab. Check the box for ""Enable remote access."" After you read the next point (Router Settings &amp; Port Forwarding) and activate port forwarding you'll be able to reach this web interface from anywhere in the world by entering the URL http://your.domain.com:9091 – Neat, huh? I've used this feature waaay more than I thought I would considering I'm out of my house all the time with my Macbook Pro. I simply download the torrent to my MBP, then upload it to my Mac Mini to do all the heavy lifting. Torrents are ready to go by the time I get home!  
Or do a similar setup with [Usenet, thanks jcp20](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/bgeos/how_to_set_up_a_mac_mini_as_a_media/c0mooxc).


**Router Settings &amp; Port Forwarding**

If you're like me, you have a few different machines all getting their internet from a wireless router. I have a WRT54GL running [Tomato Firmware](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato). In order for the router to know which computer to send requests to, you'll need to specify a few port-forwarding rules. You'll need to get the local IP of your Mac Mini from your router device list. My Mac Mini happened to be 192.168.1.145. So in my router settings I set up the following rules under the port-forwarding settings:
    Port: 5900 - Label: VNC - Forward to: 192.168.1.145
    Port: 8080 - Label: Web Server - Forward to: 192.168.1.145
    Port: 9091 - Label: Torrents - Forward to: 192.168.1.145


**Shortening Ugly URLs**

If you happen to own your own domain name you can avoid having to type in those ugly URLs (blah.dyndns.net) by using 301 redirects. Simply open or create an .htaccess file on your web host's server that says:
    redirect 301 /home http://name.domain.com:8080
    redirect 301 /torrent http://name.domain.com:9091
Now when you type in yourdomain.com/home you'll be redirected to your Mac Mini and the same for yourdomain.com/torrent! Handy.


**Sharing Preferences**

Open System Preferences and click ""Sharing."" You'll see plenty of options, mine [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/7mMCf.png). You should do the same if you want the capabilities listed here.


**Screen Sharing**

Now that all that's set up you should be able to access your Mac Mini's desktop from anywhere in the world. Just activate Finder and, in the menu bar, click Go &gt; Connect to Server. Type in:  
    vnc://your.domain.com  
You should be able to type in your user/pass and, voila, you're at your Mac Mini's desktop.  
*nihilisticmonk says that VNC is unencrypted traffic and you should [tunnel through SSH](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=os+x+tunnel+vnc+ssh).*

–––––

That's about all I've got for now. Please let me know if I'm missing anything and feel free to add your input!

This should make for a pretty nice little Mac Mini that lets you:

- Add/Edit/Delete active torrents without being anywhere near your house
- Watch movies &amp; TV shows, listen to music, view photos, and view weather from your couch
- Control your media center with an iPhone
- Create/edit websites on your Mac Mini and access those sites from the web
- View your videos on your iPhone while in other rooms of your house or apartment

Enjoy!

iphone,Is there such a thing as an unstable iPhone?,"I've got a 3G, running 3.1.2. It is not jailbroken or unlocked.

I'm writing an app, and am 99% certain it is presently crashing due my own incompetence. However, I presently only have 1 device to test on, and I'd like to be certain my phone is stable.

Many other iPhone apps crash. Safari, iPod, iTunes, C-Span. I've always assumed Apple's OSes (or the apps) had bugs and there was nothing to be done about it except wait for that near-perfect OS release.

But what if my phone has some defective memory? Maybe something is actually wrong with the phone, and I'm wasting my time here? How can I check?

**Update1**: I don't usually reboot my phone, I've just tried that and it definitely helps. App runs much longer without crashing but still crashes. At least it runs long enough for me to investigate, where-as before I could barely launch the program.

**Update2**: After rebooting my phone I'm able to run Instruments (here is a mashed-up screenshot)... http://www.flickr.com/photos/gordonmcdowell/4454688559/sizes/o/ ...I'd expect the ""Net Bytes"" to equal all the leaks...

We get regular emails from parents who tell us their kids love the game, and the only request has been for more of the same.  Ratings for our apps are few in number, but they are almost universally high.

But sales are dismal!  We're lucky if we sell a single copy some days.  We've tried advertising on AdWords, but the sales didn't even come close to the revenue.  It's hard to make a profit when you're selling a product close to the cost-per-click.  We've tried chatting up review sites, but get practically no interest except from a few kind-hearted reviewers from minor sites.  Our largest amount of referrals come from the developer forums we post on, rather than App review sites.

It's possible that our approach to educational apps (treating kids as smart and curious rather than stupid and bored, by creating apps that have a tone and approach like museums and planetariums rather than cartoon television) is just totally misguided, or maybe we're deluded and our apps just suck, but I still think we're missing something.  I mean, I've seen the crap that sells on the App Store, and I don't see it advertised anywhere - where is that success coming from?

Short of stooping to spamming forums and stuff, I can't think of much else to do.  My wife and I are doing this on the side, more for our own kids than anything, and don't really have an advertising budget to spend on this.

Does anyone have any suggestions for boosting some sales, for getting exposure?  At this point, we're not sure it's worth it to continue making apps.  (I'm not interested in doing anything shady, or engaging in pay-for-play.)

Or, I suppose I should ask if it is like this for everyone but those guys at the top?  Is this the common experience if you're not EA Games?  I didn't expect to make a mint, but we expected better sales than this.",12,10,2010-03-26,AAPL,0.03645382449030876,0.9286844730377197,0.034861739724874496

Free app that serves as workaround to Java/Flash incompatibility,"Reddit, I want to share this clever little app called Cloud Browser- it lets you use an external Firefox browser (proxy?) to go to any site and view Flash, with audio, just like you would on a computer. It's free and supports tabs, toolbars, etc. It's a litle tricky to get used to since the cursor is tiny and there is practically no in-app support, but it's free! And it works! Maybe one of you can come up with some improvements and collaborate with the programmer...?
