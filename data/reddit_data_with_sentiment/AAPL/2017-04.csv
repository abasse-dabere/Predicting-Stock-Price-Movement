apple,The 2016 MacBook Pro is an engineering marvel.,"I decided to upgrade to the 2016 MacBook Pro (non-TouchBar), and it arrived yesterday. Even though this version of the MacBook isn't a significant step up from my 2015 MacBook Pro performance-wise, I can't help but be in awe by the insanely beautiful design and compact size. 

The sound quality, screen brightness, and weight of this device—with respect to its performance power and size—honestly astounds me. I thought my 2015 was compact, but man... this blows it out of the water.

The engineers and designers at Apple should really be proud of this device. It's honestly the most beautiful laptop that I've ever used.

Edit: I know you can now manage all that by simply raising your wrist. What I am saying is that a music mode with blind adjustment could be very handy in many cases like cycling, running, on crowded tube or any situation you do not wish to raise your wrist.


Edit2: The tap-adjust/crown-crown methods are two-steps maneuver. An one-step option is much much more favored.  
If you actually tried the tap-adjust, you'll see the difference. For example, when I am cycling on the open road. The tap-adjust took 1 full second to pull off, which I simply can not safely spare. Not to mention the default app will be the workout app in this case.

iphone,AirPods after a Month User Review,"I thought this might be helpful for those wondering what day to day life has been like with this $160 gadget. 

My over impression is that these things are incredible. I'm a huge earphone user in my casual daily life. And these break much of the hassle in both paring and use. 

I use earphones while shopping, driving, walking around, I enjoy ambient music. Specifically I use one earphone, while the other dangles around my neck and cord is stuffed through my shirt to keep it from getting in my way. Ive done this for years and it's always been a slight hassle to pull the cord when it snags or reposition cords when they  yank too far around my neck. Shopping has never been fun, especially when my girlfriend thinks I'm not paying attention when I have earphones and cords out. You know how that goes... no cords is freedom. No more winding up cords when I'm finished, no more unraveling when I need them, no need to find the port (RIP) when I need to plug them in. It's seamless. This is the future. I don't need flying cars and hover boards, I need day-to-day convenience and this is magical. I hope the imagery helps, because over the past month the AirPods have been just that impressive. I know it's gushing, however my experience has been just that great. So let's talk about it. 

The battery:
It hardly ever runs out. A typical ""session"" with these on is about 2.5 hours while the battery lasts 5. The case holds 24 more hours and tends to last a week all in all. At first the idea of earphones with battery felt worrisome and too complicated. I could just pull out the cords and never have to worry about battery. Thankfully it is barely noticeable. Battery is a negligible aspect of the product. 

Build quality:
Do not buy it if the EarPods that come with the iPhone do not fit your ears. It's a damn shame but if you hate how those fit then you will hate these. The case is sturdy and even premium feeling. It has a super satisfying snap when you close it and encourages further use. Everything is magnetic and snaps into place, its impressively solid. Top to bottom. 

Sound quality:
It's okay. Some say better than EarPods, it sounds similar. Maybe a bit fuller. But that's the point. At least for me. If I want studio quality I'll use my headphones, this is for day-to-day use. I want sound to bleed in, I want to hear my surroundings. I'm not here to listen to FLAC quality music, Podcasts and easy music are perfect for me. Also sound does not diminish over distance. Amazingly quality and volume remain even while 20ft away from iPhone. 

Ease of use:
iPhone always has Bluetooth on (it won't harm the battery) and connecting means opening the case and putting in an earphone or both. It works so well I have confidence it will work every time. I cannot say this about any other Bluetooth device I own, by a long shot. A couple times I have needed to open and close and open the case to get a recognition, this has been a very rare occurrence. One ear use is my go-to. It is smart about shush earphone is out or not and will act accordingly. I pop one earphone out, it connects, in cord free and inconspicuous. Great stuff. I must stress, there's no on-off switch, you just open&gt;insert earphone&gt;go. Every time. When has Bluetooth EVER been that easy? Also when you pop them in the iPhone automatically switches to the AirPods for listening, this sounds obvious yet other OSes seem to mess this up. Finally being able to pull out an earphone to pause your sound is wonderful. I wonder why this has never been implemented before. Even better is when you replace your earphone in and sound begins to play. This means you can play/pause a show just by pulling out the earphone. No more having to find the pause button. Awesome. 

Problems: 
Losing them is a fear. However if you just paid $160 I doubt you will be careless. They fit so well to my ears however that I do not worry about them falling out. Second, I cannot seem to get them to pair with my 2016 Windows 10 laptop. Kinda weird. Third, volume gets as high as EarPods, but I wish it hit a tad higher. Fourth, I very rarely get a sync hitch. For a split second the sound echoes from one ear to the other. I'm guessing some kind of signal interference causes it to stutter. This is very seldom but still somewhat present. Lastly is the controls. They're asinine. Double tap to play/pause, solid. Or double tap to Siri, what? Not both and no volume/track control. The worst part is if you opt for pause/play mode then you cannot Hey Siri to change volume/track. So you have to pull out your phone a lot. Such a magically convenient device yet it's still shrouded in silly encumbrances. 

Final thoughts:
I can now listen to music at work. I don't have to wrap up a bunch of cords. Nothing is cooler than being rooms away from your phone and having a podcast play through the earphones, it takes portability to a new level. A hundred reasons. Top to bottom they just work. The seamless ability of the AirPods is something downright magical. I have always wanted a pair of earphones that are completely independent of each other, not only do they accomplish this but they do it surprisingly flawlessly. Hopefully this offhand review helps you visualize how they could fit into your life before making the expensive dive.  I just want to say for me, I haven't been this impressed with a technology since the first iPhone. 
Peace.

iphone,"So, I recently went from a LG Nexus 5 to an iPhone 7. Here's some things I've noticed so far.","1. The iPhone 7 has great little details that make the interface pleasing, like the sounds and haptic feedback all feel really satisfying, and little visual details make the interface seem refined.

2. Siri SUCKS compared to OK GOOGLE. Half the time it gets what I said completely wrong, and where I could simply ask google a verbal question and it would ANSWER it for me, siri just gives me a list of results that are inferior to simply googling it.

3. Obviously build quality of the iPhone is fantastic.

4. I hate how iPhone doesn't allow you to integrate Google's apps with its software, eg won't allow using GMaps instead of apple maps when using siri.

5. Absolutely the best mobile camera I've ever had.

6. Not including a headphone port is incredibly inconvenient and stupid.

I'm still getting used to the phone, so some of these criticisms might be down to that.

*Edit: Another gripe with SIRI: Today I asked it to call a local shop: ""CALL BOB'S LIQUOR STORE"". Instead of, like Google Now, just CALLING THEM using their online phone number, it instead gave me some random information about the shop. To call them, I had to click on the information, look up the number and click on that, and only THEN would I be able to call.

I've used other alternatives like LastPass and KeePass, but they're just clunky and way too ""heavy"" for their purpose, and their integration into iPhone browsers just isn't very intuitive (I understand it's a limitation with the OS, but still).

But seems many stores have newer NFC readers that support Apple Pay's new security authentication (CDCVM)

1. Went to buy a pair of boots £85, saw the card reader has 'contactless logo' beneath the amount I need to pay, told cashier I'll use contactless. She said ""I don't think you could, but you can try"" SUCCESS    ""Oh"" - is the answer

2. Went Go Karting and needs to pay £33 for rental, saw the card reader has 'contactless logo' beneath the amount I need to pay, told staff I'll use contactless. He said ""You can't, the limit is £30"" ""Can I try?"" I asked. ""Go ahead"" 
SUCCESS
He was shocked, he asked how did it work? Because people before tried and failed (I'm guessing he meant regular contactless cards). I explained him the whole Apple Pay security thing, we both feel satisfied.

3. Went currency exchange before travel and needs to pay £98, was ready to pop in my card as requested, saw the card reader has 'contactless logo' beneath the amount I need to pay, told staff I'll use contactless. Staff replied ""£30 is the limit, you need to pop in your card."" ""Can I try?"" She followed up ""It will fail and you won't get a receipt""

I tried, SUCCESS, with receipt. Everything is the same as popping in a card, except I don't have to pull out my wallet, pull out my card, pop in the card, and enter my PIN in public.

apple,Funny story: An email I sent to the CEO of Nvidia &amp; Tim Cook last month is the reason Pascal is now supported on MacOS,"On March 3rd I sent a pretty desperate (and poorly worded, apologies) group email out to Jensen H. Huang (CEO of Nvidia) and Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) essentially begging for Pascal chipset support on Macs. I have read hundreds of pages of threads waiting on Pascal support for Mac all over the web, lot of dead ends, lot of sad people giving up and selling chipsets. In an effort I considered to be completely futile, I decided to start digging around and seeing if I could find contacts and reach out to at least one of these guys, maybe they’d simply delete the email, maybe it’d never get through a filter, or best case scenario they’d at least forward the email to someone who could at least write the idea on a post it note.

What happened was even better. Tonight the CEO of Nvidia emailed me back informing me that my email was the decision Pascal has come to MacOS, that previously he had no idea it was wanted. Thanks to communities like eGPU.io, the various Hackintosh communities, the creative editors and VFX artists, and the colorists over at LiftGammaGain.com, I was able to present that there was certainly a corner of the world that wanted this. Though I haven’t heard back from Tim Cook and likely won’t, I can’t say how much it means to hear back from Nvidia’s CEO so candidly. Reaching out made this happen, and I never thought the day would come. My initial effort was basically a ""eh can't hurt to send an email"". 

I really do get the notion that Nvidia’s team wants to be out here with us, delivering support for MacOS probably doesn’t make nearly the impact on their revenue that the gamers or deep learning crowd out there would, but the fact that they did this for us is incredible. Continue to show Nvidia your love, people! 

Excuse the cheesey long first email, I was really just trying to paint a picture of how important Nvidia/Mac usability is thru the only angle I’m familiar with: creatives/filmmaking (I'm no hackintosh aficianado, I only understand how important Nvidia cards are for software like Resolve, the Adobe suite, etc). Was an honor to hear back from him, I can’t believe my email is what finally made it happen after a year or more of our communities starting to lose hope.

apple,One of my biggest criticisms of the iOS Music app that I hope to see addressed in iOS 11. I haven't seen others mention this yet.,"I just sent this piece of feedback to Apple via the official Feedback app and I thought I'd share it here, as I suspect other music fans will agree:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Every artist has two separate pages in Music - the artist's main Apple Music page and the user's discography page of that artist.
There should be a simpler way to jump between these two. Or they should be consolidated into one page.**



In Apple Music, the fact that there are two separate homes for each artist can be confusing and makes the app more difficult to navigate. On one hand, there's the main Apple Music page with Top Songs, Albums, Top Videos, etc... On the other hand, there's the artist's page in my library that includes all the artist's albums that I've added.

These are two separate locations and it's difficult to jump between them, which creates confusion because there's no central home for each artist. You can jump from the library to the main page via the ""See More by..."" at the bottom, but that only works in one direction.

For example, if I'm listening to something, I often want to jump back into the album, so I'll tap the album name on the Now Playing screen. But from there, I often want to jump back into the artist's discography, so I'll tap the artist's name in red text at the top of the album. However, instead of bringing me to the discography in my library, that brings me to the artist's main Apple Music page, with Top Songs, Albums, Top Videos etc...
**The problem is that the artist's Apple Music page feels more like promotional material for the artist, as opposed to being the central repository in my library for that artist's work. I understand wanting to promote more stuff by that artist that the user might like, but as a fan of a particular artist, I usually just want to see more of the stuff I have by them. There should be a way to combine these locations, or make it easier to jump between them.**

Perhaps you can add tabs like on the Search screen for ""Apple Music"" and ""Your Library"". But whatever the solution is, I think it would really help the flow of the app if the artist's two pages were consolidated into one central location, and if it was simpler for the user to get to that artist's main discography in my library.

Thanks!

As a big music lover, Apple fan, and design enthusiast, this kind of thing bothers me a lot because it harms the overall flow of the app. The Music app's shortcomings are something I think about and analyse quite a bit. I've written about Apple Music extensively ([iOS 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2qeuvz/the_ios_music_app_is_awful_heres_whats_wrong_with/), [iOS 9](https://medium.com/@heyyoudvd/apple-music-has-a-fundamental-problem-that-goes-deeper-than-mere-bugs-and-ui-confusion-here-s-the-ab446001475), [iOS 10](https://medium.com/@heyyoudvd/apple-still-doesnt-understand-music-fans-and-their-listening-habits-2bda3428fc7e), and most recently, [iOS 11 suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5s36bt/a_list_of_things_id_like_to_see_improved_or_fixed/))

I hope iOS 11 brings more improvements  to the Music app. It improved this year over what it was on iOS 9, but it still has a way to go.

apple,Spotify app update 8.3.0 - very poorly optimized for iPad,"Hi all, I recently updated the Spotify app on my iPad and immediately wished I hadn't. Whereas the previous version was not perfect, it was at least optimized for the 2048x1536 canvas of an iPad. The new version, however is a *huge* step in the wrong direction. Have a look for yourselves: http://imgur.com/a/CLJhd

It looks like somebody stretched the iPhone app (made for 4.0""-5.5"" displays). Gone are the pop-out menus that kept context for the user, replaced with full-screen menus with options taking up 1/20 of the width of the display, the rest blank, un-utilized nothingness. The previous information-dense, yet clearly hierarchical layout has been disposed for a nightmare of tapping and swiping back. 

This layout would be partially-excusable if the app had been updated to support Slide Over and Split View, but *it doesn't.* Now you're left with a phone app moonlighting as a tablet app, much like the Android phones. At least on Android, that app would at least allow split-screen use.

2. Improved battery life. I own a series 0 and the battery life has been great, but I'd love to have a watch that lasts 2 days or 1 day with an always on display. Speaking of which:

3. Always on display.

4. Built in iris/fingerprint scanner. If we should believe the rumors, Apple is currently hard at work at integrating the camera and fingerprint scanner into the iPhone display, it would be great to see this technology applied to the watch.

Should app launching be rethought?,"I came to the realization that as I've amassed a pretty significant collection of apps, I mainly use Spotlight to launch anything that isn't an app on the first page or dock. It's simply quicker to pull down the notification shade slightly (works great on a 7 with the Taptic Engine) and use Spotlight than to go through folders and hunt for the icon I want, assuming that I can recall the name of the app I need quickly.

So this leads me to think, have we outgrown the iOS home screen that we've known and loved for ten years? It's a fundamental design paradigm of iOS, I know, and 3D touch has certainly modernized it, but as the years go by it's getting harder for me to think that there aren't better solutions to launching apps and using screen real estate for the home screen(s). The situation isn't particularly dire on iPhone, but I believe that the icon grid on iPad may be holding Apple back from more innovative uses of its real estate for the home screen, and at this point it feels anachronistic.

I hope you enjoy. 

This is my Macintosh SE, complete with the official Apple carry-on bag and manual. http://imgur.com/a/K0kjA

Released in 1987 for $2900 with an *optional* 20 MB Hard Drive for an extra $1000. In todays dollars that is ~$8,235

Specs:
Motorola 68000 @ 8MHZ

1MB of RAM

800k floppy drive

20MB HDD

9-inch display @ 512 x 342


From Wiki:
&gt;The SE's notable new features, compared to its similar predecessor, the Macintosh Plus, were:

&gt;First compact Macintosh with an internal drive bay for a hard disk (originally 20 MB or 40 MB) or a second floppy drive.
First compact Macintosh that featured an expansion slot (SE stood for ""System Expansion"").

&gt;Used the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), introduced with the Apple IIGS, for keyboard and mouse interface.
Improved SCSI support with faster data throughput.
Better reliability and longer life expectancy due to the addition of a cooling fan.

&gt;The SE was designed to accommodate either one or two floppy drives, or a floppy drive and a hard drive. After-market brackets were designed to allow the SE to accommodate two floppy drives as well as a hard drive, however it was not a configuration supported by Apple. In addition an external floppy disk drive could also be connected, making the SE the only other Macintosh besides the Macintosh Portable and Macintosh II which could support three floppy drives, though its increased storage, RAM capacity and optional internal hard drive rendered the external drives less of a necessity than for its predecessors. After Apple introduced the Macintosh SE/30 in January 1989, a logic board upgrade was sold by Apple dealers as a high-cost upgrade for the SE, consisting of a new SE/30 motherboard, case front and internal chassis to accommodate the upgrade components.

&gt;Single-floppy SE models also featured a drive access light in the spot where the second floppy drive would be.

&gt;Additionally the SE had a special PDS slot that allowed for expansion cards, such as accelerators, to be installed. The SE can be upgraded to 50 MHz and more than 5 MB with the MicroMac accelerators. In the past other accelerators were also available such as the Sonnet Allegro. Since installing a card required opening the computer's case and exposing the user to high voltages from the internal CRT, Apple recommended only authorized Apple dealers to install cards and sealed the case with then-uncommon Torx screws.

But my real pride and joy is that bag. I need to get it cleaned up a bit, but I definitely think that bag is more of a rare piece of apple history than the machine. Its a beautiful bag, but theres no way in hell I'm carrying around a 28lb computer. 

Oh... does it work? It sure does. Here is a short video of it booting up. Sadly, there is no OS on it currently. So that's the next step, install Mac OS 7.5.5 and get it fully running again. Maybe even get some Hypercard on there. 

PS I know people always have the worst, most annoying music on their videos. I promise you I did not make that mistake.

Well I decided to go to the Apple Store/Genius Bar after setting up an appointment last night.

I went a location in the Los Angeles area.

I arrived, and yes they were quite busy and it's not even the weekend yet, but when is the Apple Store never busy? 

But I arrived and they checked me in and they had chairs and tables to sit your devices on and they also had free wifi.

It was quite a wait so I just read a magazine, but one of the technicians came and was very nice and fixed my issue FOR FREE.

They installed Sierra OS on my mac for no cost. It took about an hour overall, but the wait was worth it. It was half an hour or so to install the mac software again, and another half an hour to install the OS X.

What's good is how because they were so busy and packed, he was helping three other customers at the same time as me yet he was still giving good customer service. Very nice.

They were so helpful and awesome and I feel lucky enough to live close by an Apple Store.",92,173,2017-04-21,AAPL,0.02509927749633789,0.8937058448791504,0.08119489997625351

apple,Apple Watch FINALLY makes sense because...,"I've had the Apple Watch since day one, so I've lived  through all of its growing pains.  I think it was launched poorly from day one with apps and tiny icons representing some sort of fiddly crippled computer on your wrist. It never really felt like it had a purpose or identity...until now. 

I downloaded the new Overcast update, and loaded some podcasts on my Watch. I popped in my AirPods and went out for a run. There was something so liberating about being completely unencumbered. No wires, no bulky iPhone 7+ banging around in my pocket. Just AirPods and Apple Watch. 

So...I find myself outside. I'm completely unencumbered and untethered. The Watch is tracking my workout, feeding me entertainment, in a stylish small package. Finally this is starting to make sense...with one exception. I still have that nagging anxiety that my wife, kids, or work will need to contact me for something important, or an emergency, and won't be able to reach me...

So, for my needs, Apple has to add LTE to the Watch but they can limit it (for now) to iMessages and Phone. If they allow the Watch to sync podcasts and update Apple music playlists automatically and independently while charging, or on wifi, then this becomes an experience ONLY the Watch can provide. 

The Watch with AirPods, and LTE for iMessages and Phone becomes the ultimate untethered exercise and ""around the town"" device. It is so liberating to leave the iPhone at home and live a little. Listen to music or podcasts, check your heart rate and exercise progress, but still be able to communicate with people if you choose to. This is what the Watch should become. 

This, with a nice UI redesign (get rid of the honeycomb app screen), and a brand new marketing campaign could make the Watch a must have device (for me anyway.) It's an experience unique to the Watch.",164,259,2017-04-23,AAPL,0.027367668226361275,0.9315369129180908,0.041095491498708725

apple,Did Steve Jobs ever offer an opinion on phone cases?,"I was eating lunch with family this weekend and one relative, let's call him X, started talking about phones. He was saying he needs to get a new phone and was talking about what he likes and dislikes about phones out there today. He took out his phone, I believe it was an iPhone 5-something but I don't know what model (no offense guys but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQdP_NC4EtY&amp;t=6) is basically what I think of the iPhone naming scheme). It was the small model, whatever it was.

It was all dinged up around the sides, but worked fine. Someone brought up phone cases. It was then that X said something that would fit perfectly in /r/iamverysmart. I'm paraphrasing, but it was something like:

&gt; Steve Jobs meticulously researched and designed the iPhone's dimensions to fit perfectly in the hand, and so I don't use a phone case because it would betray that research. The form factor of an iPhone in a case is not what he designed.

So I know that there are plenty of people out there who don't use cases, but I've always heard it was for some other reason: it simply looks better without a case, or it doesn't fit in my pocket with a case (this one coming mostly from women), or something like that. But never this fairly obnoxious reason that X gave.

Does anyone know if SJ ever commented on this one way or another? Did he ever seem to support or oppose the sale and use of iPhone cases? I asked X if larger phones weren't useful/desirable, why have millions of larger-dimensioned phones from other manufacturers (and eventually Apple!) sold well, and his response was ""Two words: womens' shoes"" (meaning something like ""they might seem nice in the short term but ultimately are uncomfortable and you wouldn't want to use it for years on end"").",165,172,2017-04-25,AAPL,0.03511730954051018,0.9256539344787598,0.03922877833247185

apple,Does Apple no longer sell the complete power cord with laptops?,"My Dad got one of the new Macbooks with the touch strip at top, and I noticed he was using extension cord to sit at a table two feet from the wall. I looked and he was only using half the cord (the part that runs from the laptop to the fat white box). He doesn't have the extender that runs from the box to the wall like every Apple I have bought previously (including the Macbook I am typing this on).

Does Apple no longer include the full cord in the box, or did my Dad accidentally throw it out? I looked in the box the computer came in and it seem like they did only include half the cable, but I wanted to check.
