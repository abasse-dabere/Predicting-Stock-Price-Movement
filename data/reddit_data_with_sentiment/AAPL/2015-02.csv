apple,WiFi ridiculously slow on Yosemite? Try this.,"Ever since upgrading to Yosemite, ~~my internet speeds on my iMac have been horrible~~. (*edit: I really phrased this poorly. What follows is a rewrite of the first paragraph.*) I have had problems connecting to web sites and other remote machines. Once connected, transfer speeds have been OK. I narrowed the problem down to an issue with resolving a domain name to an IP. I did a little research and found a solution.

The issue seems to lie in Apple's new `discoverd` process, which is responsible for name resolution. Apparently, its pretty buggy.

If you're experiencing ~~slow internet~~ issues connecting to web sites, etc., try running this command from the Terminal:

    killall discoveryd

All this command does is stop the running `discoverd` process and relaunch it. Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.",191,572,2015-02-01,AAPL,0.07693567126989365,0.8845611214637756,0.03850318118929863

apple,"Just purchased a mid-2012 MacBook Pro for $400, and I can finally say I am happy with a computer for the first time in my life.","I got lucky on eBay and found a MacBook Pro listed in the wrong section and snatched it at a steal of a price. It's the MD101ll/A model with a 500 gb HDD, 2.5 ghz i5, and 4 GB DDR3 ram.

A little backstory: I started on DOS as a very young kid because my dad wanted me to learn it before I moved on to Windows. I started on Windows '98 and have been with Microsoft ever since due to the general affordability of PCs compared to Macs. I recently got my first iPhone about a month ago, fell madly in love, and decided I'd round out the family with a MacBook (already had an iPad)

How did I live without this for so long? Compatibility is a breeze from phone to tablet to laptop and from person to person. I have never been able to get a project done for school without running into any issues along the way, and yet here I am doing just that. It has cut my study time and my work time by at least a quarter, if not a third. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for me as a new Mac user to really get the most out of it? I know nothing about Macs, so even the most basic recommendation is welcome :)",72,104,2015-02-01,AAPL,0.029077202081680298,0.9245557188987732,0.046367086470127106

apple,Will your mom use the Apple Watch? (this is an important question),"Apple is renowned for making products that can be used by everyone. Apple does NOT build products specifically for power users and tech savvy people.

So here's the question to ponder: will your mom want to use the Apple Watch? Will she actually see any value in it?

With the **iPod**, my mom could listen to audiobooks and thousands of songs without having to bother with CDs. It was a no-brainer for her once I set it up.

With the **iPad**, my mom suddenly [felt empowered](http://www.imore.com/power-users-vs-empowered-users). Browsing the web, looking up recipes, reading books, and yes, taking photos. It was and still the device she uses the most and feels the most at ease with.

The **iPhone** she doesn't use. She doesn't like the small screen and the small keyboard (this was before iPhone 6 came out) and she genuinely doesn't need a phone. If she ever does want a smartphone though, it's obvious which one I'll get for her, simply based on her already using the iPad.

But now, the **Watch**.

I see no scenarios where she would use it. The Watch is even smaller than an iPhone. But even if she had perfect vision, it still wouldn't change anything. She simply wouldn't be interested. She has no interest in tracking her steps. She has no interest in receiving iMessages on her wrist. She has no interest in charging a watch every night. She certainly doesn't have any interest in browsing her photos on the Watch (let's all take a moment to admit how ridiculous that part of the presentation was).

Maybe your mom is more tech savvy than mine. My mom is simply an analogy for any person who doesn't go out seeking technology for the sake of technology and would rather go spend time in nature, at a park or a garden. It's an analogy for a person who rather wants to spend as little time in front of screens as possible, but welcomes technology (like the iPad) if it helps her accomplish something specific.

The Watch doesn't really help my mom solve any specific problem. It's simply of no use to her. She's not interested in trying out incredible miniature technology just for the sake of trying it.

I know, I know. The Watch is never meant to be as big as the iPhone. Or even the iPad. But still. Even when we take out the business side of things and just look at the usefulness of the Watch ... if you judge a technology by how useful it is to people like my mom, then the Watch kind of doesn't deliver.

Apple usually knows their customers better than the customers know themselves. In this case, it seems like Apple has built a product that is definitely not for people like my mom. Which is ok. So long as Apple knows who it's actually selling the Watch to.

apple,*UPDATE* Broken macbook in college,"Hi. I'm still on my phone on the alien blue app, so if anyone could link my previous posts in the comments, it would be much appreciated. 

Great news. The laptop has been paid for! I went into college administration seeking more advice and brought up that I plan on taking him to small claims. The college were afraid of their reputation if somebody is being taken to court because of an act that happened in the library. They are speaking with the kids parents about a repayment plan. The money was sent into my bank account today What's important is that the problem has been resolved, and I can get back on track with my coursework as soon as it arrives!

Would like to say a big thanks to /r/Apple for supporting me and helping resolve the problem, especially with legal aspects of the situation. Take care!

apple,uBlock 0.8.7.0 released for Safari,"## https://chrismatic.io/ublock/

---

Hi!

Today (well, just a few minutes ago, actually), I pushed uBlock 0.8.7.0 for Safari.

[µBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) is an efficient, lightweight, and lean blocker for Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. It's built to:

* [use less memory](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#memory) than bloated alternatives
* [consume less CPU power and energy](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#cpu)

While:

* making your browsing experience clutter-free and *fast*
* protecting your privacy
* letting your battery, um, relax.

**TL;DR:** in slightly different, slightly less technical terms, [here's what µBlock reports](http://chrisly.me/image/2Q2C3m3o1J2J) when I'm at `theverge.com`.

---

It's easy to get started: µBlock comes with built-in filter lists to block ads, background tracking requests, annoyances (malware, popups, etc.), and more.

But µBlock is also highly customizable and gives you tremendous control:

* You can write your own rules
* You can [toggle the whitelisting of a site with a click of a button](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface) (so, for instance, you might whitelist reddit as a way of keeping the ad revenue support) 
* You can get even finer-grain control with [Dynamic Filtering](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering).

---

**µBlock currently only works on Safari 8 and later.** (*See footnote for explanation*).

## [You can download the latest version of µBlock here](https://chrismatic.io/ublock/)

---

0.8.7.0 has tons of improvements to the Safari extension and µBlock in general. Expect improved performance and reliability, refined and more thorough blocking, and other improvements. [Here's a summarized changelog](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases).

Give µBlock a try, and please let me know what you think. You can always PM me with any issues, questions, or concerns you have.

---

*Now to the footnote:*

There appears to be a bug in older Safari versions which causes them to crash during launch, and while **I'd really, really love** to investigate it and fix it, I can't find a reasonable way of running older versions of Safari on Yosemite. This means I can't debug the issue.

I'll try to figure something out — I would really appreciate your patience as I do my best to work on bringing support to older Safari's (especially 7.x and 6.x).

Meanwhile, again, please avoid installing µBlock on versions of Safari that aren't 8.0 or later.

Thanks! Enjoy a faster, cleaner web.

- a different kind of customers (think the Apple Watch Edition made of gold)

apple,On Tesla and the future of Apple,"I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who is a serious fan of both Apple and Tesla. I'm also one of many folks around here who have discussed previously the possibility of Apple purchasing Tesla (or producing their own car), which tends to result in being downvoted into oblivion. It's pretty interesting that the Apple car/Tesla purchase rumours are again gaining some traction, but I think a lot of our knee-jerk reactions in this case is to remain opposed to it. After all, Apple's success, in part, is due to its laser-like focus, and expanding into other markets may be a mistake.

I think the reality is that, eventually, Apple's focus *will* shift, although that doesn't mean it'll have a negative impact on the electronics that the company produces. But I'd characterize Apple as one of the few companies out there that activity displays its conscience - even to the detriment of its shareholders - in that it promotes equality, fair working laws (a battle it hasn't won in developing markets), and a desire to combat climate change.

Tesla becomes an interesting topic of discussion, then, because it is the most emergent green-car company out there. They are possibly head-and-shoulders above other companies in terms of battery development, and due to their outlook on fighting climate change (or, cynically, because they wish to make their brand more relevant) they have made their patents open to the car market. The issue, though, is that people focusing on Apple's intentions (or lack of them) with Tesla remains very short sighted.

I'm pretty sure it was Warren Buffet who once remarked that green energy markets are a no-brainer for anyone looking to make piles of money. The first company that successfully develops affordable, renewable energy solutions will make money hand over fist, and Apple is in the remarkable position to seize that role. Developing electric cars is one aspect of that approach, but solar and wind farms are an even bigger opportunity, and Apple might have the money to provide energy for far more than their offices and retail stores.

That said, doing something like that would be hardly altruistic, even if Tim Cook and his board members desire to combat climate change. Unseating Big Oil as the chief creator of energy in North America (and later the world) would be a huge endeavour, one with the potential for massive profits*, but one that would likely require the will and resources to fight as historically oil companies have done all in their power to crush alternative energy sources.

(*and if folks are worried about the iPhone being the primary money-earner for Apple, if the company refocused on providing clean energy then that would no longer be a concern.)

It's just a thought I've been having for the past year or so. Maybe it's even more of a HOPE, because I am concerned for the future. But if Apple's long-term goal was to seize the energy market, then a $1 trillion value might still be selling the company way short.

*tl;dr: Apple being named after a fruit might be even more apt than we thought, as they have the money and ability to become the most successful energy company in the world*",35,59,2015-02-15,AAPL,0.030374892055988312,0.9299793243408203,0.039645809680223465

apple,I made a screensaver,"Hey /r/apple

I'm Siggi and together with my friend Hjalti we've created a screensaver for OS X called Saver Screensson. I don't know how many people use screensavers today, but since I frequent this subreddit and this is my first OS X related project I wanted to share it with you.

I draw for a living and Hjalti develops, and we had been wanting to work on something together for a long time. One day I was playing around with geometric 'stencil' images and stacked them on top of each other, so it created this strange and colorful pattern. Next I tried animating it by continuously sliding the images on top of each other and it created this soothing effect. I showed it to Hjalti and we decided to make something out of this. That something ended up being a screensaver. 


The screensaver is an ever changing artwork with almost endless amount of possible generated patterns and images. In a nutshell it works by randomly choosing stencil images in a random color and continuously stacking them together and thus generating new artwork. I drew 340 different stencil images and I've put together 19 color palettes to choose from. But describing this is is kind of difficult so you should really see it. Would love to hear what you guys think, and if you have some questions just shoot!

apple,Another sneak peek at Apollo: a brand new Reddit app for iPhone,"Hey all,

The [reaction](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/) to Apollo was crazy. Crazy. I'm super happy so many people are excited, and you brought a ton of awesome suggestions. Development is still going really well (it's just me working away and taking Smash Bros 4 breaks with my roommates), and I wanted to share with you some new updates quickly and a preview of some features you were curious about.

For those who are hearing about Apollo for the first time, it's a brand new Reddit app for iPhone that I'm developing. I'm a former Apple intern, and I haven't really been happy with the browsing experience on Reddit when on my iPhone, so I wanted to build something a super fast and comfortable browsing experience, that's gorgeous and feels right at home on the iPhone. It's got beautiful thumbnails for media, great gestures for getting around, a Jump Bar for quickly going to subreddits, easy to navigate comments, power user features, and a lot of small touches that come together to create a really delightful experience. The [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/) has a ton of great details.

You can check out http://apolloapp.io to get an email exactly when it comes out and see some more details about the app, and you can sub to /r/apolloapp for more details on how the development is going, and post threads if you have questions (or of course post them here!). I love hearing what you guys think, it's like jet fuel. :)

Without further ado...

# Dark Mode

This was requested a *ton*. I initially didn't have it planned for the 1.0 release, but it's clear it's super important to you all, so it's included now. What do you think?

# Comments

Got a lot of questions as to how this would look, and I didn't want to share anything right away as I hadn't finished it. My main issue with comments in a lot of apps, is that it's really easy to get lost when you're deep in a comment thread. You have no idea who's responding to who, and how deep into the replies you are. I went with a color-coding solution, where the depth of a comment has a corresponding color so you can see at a glance where the comment is and who it's replying to. You can also see if a comment was gilded or edited, and full formatting is included, from ~~strikethroughs~~ to super^scripts. You'll be able to tap on the person's name to jump right to their profile, tap on a post to collapse it, long press to see a list of options for the comment, or swipe for some quick access gestures. And yes, there's a swipe to collapse the comment thread to quickly jump out. Still tweaking the comments overall though.

# Link Posts and Self Posts

The last preview showed what media such as images and videos will look like when viewing a subreddit (large, gorgeous previews of their content, with the option to shrink them if you so desire), but some people were curious what self posts and link posts would look like. I thought a long time about how I wanted these to look, and I decided for link posts that I wanted to keep it really simple. Currently, with the Reddit website and many apps, it's hard to tell if you're looking at an image or a link, because they both have the same image thumbnail. You'll tap the image thinking and half the time not know where you'll end up. For Apollo, I wanted this to be obvious, so there's a clear blue link to the content that the post is linking to that you can tap to view in the in-app browser, making it very clear at a glance it's a link, and putting the link front and center. If this isn't up your alley, I'd love to hear other suggestions, I'm still playing around with this look.

For self posts, similarly, I wanted it to be really clear you're looking at a self post, not something else. This was relatively easy thanks to the links having a nice blue link and the media having thumbnails, but I still wanted it to be very clear, so self posts also have a little indicator by the subreddit showing that it's a text-based self post.

[Self Post and Link Posts in a subreddit](http://i.imgur.com/a6jkCNt.png)

# Image Viewer

Many people were curious how Apollo handles photos and albums. Creating a comfortable browsing experience was the most significant thing I concentrated on with Apollo, so I made sure it doesn't take you away from what you're currently doing and require you to go back after you're done. I *loved* the approach that apps like Tweetbot and Twitterrific take, where it overlays the image you tapped on top of what you're currently doing, full-screen, and allows you to just flick it away when you're done. If it's an album, just swipe through it like you would in the Photos app. For albums with associated descriptions (shown in the screenshot below), those will be visible within the overlay, and there will be an indicator showing what image you're currently on. You can also pull from the left side of the screen to immediately open the comments.

# Self Post Reading

Lastly, I wanted to show you page that you're shown when you select a self post from a subreddit. Instead of just having it be the same as a media post, a lot of self-posts such as the beloved Jenny and Zack tale are incredibly text-heavy, and I wanted to make sure that it was tailored toward reading better than a media post would be. So I made the content that you'll be reading front and center, and dialed everything back a little. Just like with media, however, once you're done reading the comments will be right there.

# Public Beta

As for the beta (been getting a lot of messages about that) it's still coming soon. I'm hoping for it to be very soon, just touching up some things, and after all the feedback last time I want to make sure it's in a really great state before I put it in your hands. But worry not, it's coming soon! If you want to know when it's coming, I'm not taking any requests to be testers quite yet, but sub to /r/apolloapp, I'll be posting there as soon as it drops and you'll be able to sign up then. It'll just be a basic form where you can enter your email address and I'll be using TestFlight to support the beta, so I can have 1,000 of you. You can also sign up on http://apolloapp.io to get an email when it launches and see some more details!

mac,Is anyone else disappointed in Apple's computer offerings?,"I feel like desktops and laptops should be more upgradeable and serviceable. It would be great if the mobile devices were too, (micro SD slots would be sweet), but I realize some things will never happen.

in particular, I think iMacs, while beautiful are incredibly wasteful.  Even if nothing goes wrong with it, in 5 years you have an out of date desktop with a precariously old hard drive, with an absolutely gorgeous monitor that is permanently attached to an computer with half the lifespan.  You can get that monitor without the imac attached to it, but it is trivially less expensive, and the mac minis are underpowered compared to the iMac.  The Mac Pro is horrendously expensive compared to the iMac.  I have worked on all in one PC desktops that can actually be worked on without lint free gloves, suction cups and a heat gun.  Are they quite as sleek an beautiful?  No, but I am tired of form before function.  I think it's appalling that very pricey computers are being sold with soldered RAM, proprietary storage cards and batteries that need to be replaced with the keyboard. The 3 year warranty should be standard if it is not reasonable for a consumer to replace the most basic consumable parts.  A hard drive should never be so difficult to replace as it is in the iMac.  The machines are prematurely disposed of.

apple,"Apple Falsely Accused me of tampering with my Phone...now I'm out $1000+, how do I prove my innocence?","**UPDATE:** The situation has gone from Bad to Worse!  Apple is claiming a missing 'capacitor'.  See bottom of post for photos and details.

**TLDR:** Apple won't replace my under-warranty iPhone 5S, even though they agree it has a hardware issue that would normally covered, because a sticker with the serial number inside the phone is ""mis-aligned"" indicating tampering [edit: a second store now claims a capacitor is missing so I'm being denied for that reason.  I have used the phone with no problems since I got it and have no idea what a capacitor is for].  The phone has never been 'tampered with/opened' for as long as it has been in my passion and I obtained in directly from the Apple store Yorkdale

* I bought (unlocked from the Apple store) my iPhone 5S on the day it came out.  
* In July 2014 I had it replaced under warranty in the Apple Store 
* Fast-forward to today when I had another hardware issue (screen turning blue and in constant reboot cycle).  I took it into the Apple store and was told that it was a hardware issue and they would replace the phone but they just needed to ""run some tests"" first.
* 30 minutes later I was informed that the phone would not be replaced because they (a technician and two different managers) have seen an internal serial-number sticker that is mis-aligned which supposedly proves my phone has been opened
* My phone has never left my possession since I received in from the Apple store as a replacement in July
* This phone has never been taken in for any type of service by ANYONE since I received it from the Apple store
* I have never attempted (nor would I even know how) to open my phone
* I asked the Apple store to take photos of whatever sticker they say was mis-aligned and they did but they refused to show me the photos (they said it was confidential or something that made no sense) but did promise to upload the photos to my Apple file so that they could be reviewed centrally by an engineer

This is absolutely bizarre.  **What possible motivation would I have to take my phone to non-certified repair technician when it's currently under Apple care (meaning if I took it anywhere else I'd have to pay)?!?**  The only theory the manager in the store could suggest is maybe someone would open the phone to remove evidence of water damage but I asked and she confirmed that the sensor (or whatever it is maybe just a chemical thing) inside that checks for water damage did not indicate any such damage.

I am completely cutoff from my business, friends and family.  I can't afford a new phone at the moment and have no idea how I can prove to Apple that what they're accusing me of is totally false and unfair.

Has this happened to anyone here before?  Can anyone suggest a possible recourse?  I found a couple similar cases [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3548298?tstart=0) and [here](http://greatiostips.tumblr.com/post/41578329202/i-didnt-tamper-with-my-iphone).

**Current Status (will provide updates here with latest news):** I took the phone to a second apple store, Yorkdale Mall (Toronto) and they agreed to do a ""deep inspection"".  [See here](http://i.imgur.com/ig7GHlP.png) for an image of the work authorization.  The result, as best as it has been explained to me, is that there is apparently a missing 'capacitor' which according to Apple proves that my phone was modified.  I was able to obtain a photo from the geniuses of the inside of the phone!  Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/UchCjWR.png  This is really bad news as it's even harder now for me to prove the truth: this phone was never opened/modified since Apple gave it to me in July 2014.

**Previous Update:**  I have escalated the issue on the phone to a Tier 2 technician who sent a request for an engineer to review the photos.  I have also complained to Apple Customer Relations who said I should wait for the engineer's result to come back but if they agree with the store then I am out of luck.",242,371,2015-02-19,AAPL,0.18406759202480316,0.7905703186988831,0.02536211907863617

mac,Someone used my identity and stole my MacBook Pro I just ordered from UPS before it got to my house,"Wednesday Night I purchased a Refurbished MacBook Pro right from the Apple Store app, even using apple pay. Everything went smoothly and I was sent confirmation saying it would be delivered on Monday to my house, 5 days shipping because of the weekend. 

Thursday night I checked the tracking info I was given through UPS and low and behold it said it was scheduled for early delivery on Friday. I knew I would be at work so I printed out the Pre Release signature form, signed it and attached it to the wall right inside the lobby of my house so the Driver could see it and leave the package there. 

Yesterday while at work around 11am I got a notification and email stating it was delivered!! Yay!! 3 hours later when I got home I checked to see, and there was no package anywhere, and the Pre Release form was still attached to the wall. (They are supposed to take it when they deliver the package). I asked my neighbor who was doing some work outside if he had seen a UPS truck deliver a package to my house around 11 and he said he said that none had come at all. 

Panicking I immediately called UPS, told them what happened , and they got in contact with the driver, who then called me and said that she had met me a few blocks over in front of a convenience store, where I showed her an ID and asked if she had my laptop. She then got the package and had the person ( who was not me) sign for it and then they took off. 

Clearly I did not do any of this as I was at work, and someone in 24 hours or less found out I was having a computer delivered, created an ID with my name and address on it, tracked down what UPS truck had my computer, and fraudulently perpetrated being me. 

The UPS driver said she was going to go back to the convenience store to see if there cameras picked up anything and to call the police. I did so, and upon the arrival of the police got a call from the Driver saying that they got the whole thing on video. We went down to the store where the police watched the tape , saw that the kid was dropped of by another car, came up and proceeded to show the driver an ID and after signing for it ran off around the block and assumably got back in the car and left. 

They were unable to get a license plate for the car, but got a make and model, and the driver gave the police a description of the kid. I explained to the police that I had only told two people whom I work with that I was getting a new computer, and the pre release form did not say anything about the package being a computer, and it only displayed my information and signature, so how did this person know I was getting a laptop which he asked for when showing the driver an ID. The police are opening an investigation and I'm really hoping this prick gets caught. 

Knowing I was now out $1600 and no computer , I called apple to see if there was anything they could do. After almost 2 hours on the phone with them, I told them the story, and they are opening their own investigation, and will work with law enforcement to see what happened and how this happened, and are refunding me my money (minus the tax). I was also given the serial number of the computer, so I can give that to the police incase anyone tries to sell it or pawn it off they can track it back to them. 

I just can not believe that someone, who had no knowledge of me getting a computer was able to find out, track it down, forge an ID of me and do this in such short time. I am furious and praying that they find this guy.

apple,"Now that it's been out for over a year, what are your thoughts on flat design?","I remember the response to flat design was initially very polarizing. But now that it's been a year, how do you feel about it? Has it grown on you? Are you sick of it? Do you still love it? 

Reading up on it, I'm sort of baffled as to why Ive claims he retired skeumorphism and replaced it with flat design. 

&gt;&gt;“When we sat down last November (to work on iOS 7), we understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass, they didn’t need physical buttons, they understood the benefits,” says Ive. “So there was an incredible liberty in not having to reference the physical world so literally. We were trying to create an environment that was less specific. It got design out of the way.”

I think it's funny because I don't think skeumorphism existed solely for functional purposes. I don't know where he got the idea of it being a transitionary design language. It's not transitionary if it's useful design. Things don't always have to be revamped. 

I liked it because I felt that everything had it's place. It was design that presented objects as themselves rather than as a reference to them. Flat design feels overwhelming to me because there is an added layer between what something is and what it does. I feel as though you end up spending time processing information that isn't immediately obvious. Just peeking back at iOS6 I'm amazed at just how much more at ease my senses are. A few other posts I found summarized it pretty well: 

&gt;&gt;Skeuomorphism also adds visual interest. The problem with iOS 7 (and I’ve upgraded my iPad to it, but not my iPhone) is it a rather boring interface. The visual detail of skeuomorphism kept the look and feel interesting and complex. One of the problems with Modern architecture’s design pallet was how boring and repetitive the buildings look. IBM Plaza in Chicago or the BofA Building in SF, as examples. Thus, Modern rather quickly gave way to Post Modern, a style that tries to blend the simple forms of Modern with the architectural elements of pre-modern.


&gt;&gt;That is the problem with Ive’s vision in iOS is it is very colorful, really too colorful as it looks like Target’s idea of a girl’s college dorm room, but it lacks anything more interesting than color. Its primitive design elements and lack of detail resemble Modern architecture, with few choices in dimensional palette. Both are very clean, but they are boring. The shading, simulated textures, and quirks of Job’s favored skeuomorphism look kept things interesting and visually alive. The Seagram Building in New York was revolutionary for its time and place, but once surrounded by its imitations, even it, with its excellent use of materials, wasn’t as interesting.

AND

&gt;&gt;totally agree. as i’ve said elsewhere, skeuomorphism works because humans have evolved for millions of years in a 3D world. So 3D is intuititve and beaufitul for us. it’s really that simple. it’s not about progress. Why do we still like pictures in picture frames? why do we still wear ties? shoe laces? why do we prefer silk, leather, and wool to nylon? because we’re human, not robots. Jonny Ive is either suffering massive hubris or myopia…it’s a realy shame if apple’s years under steve jobs become in hindsight just a relative flash in the pan…

and also:

&gt;&gt;...let’s not confuse skeuomorphism with making something look like it is really is or making it clear what it really does... The problem with many computer interfaces is they use icons that have no meaning and often can’t be figured out intuitively... every year we get new programs with rows of icons we have to figure out. Skeuomorphism helps as you say with transition. But when [and if] it’s time to move on, you need something that is more clear and more functional. 

Does flat design do this? I don't believe it does. Thoughts?

apple,Tempted to switch to a 6+.,"So, for a while, I've used Android. In fact, most of my phones have been Android. (I still miss the Razr V3)

Now, Android has good features, and is a solid piece of software. However, I've gotten pretty jaded over the years. It's unreliable at the worst times (camera software failing to record, among others), the apps are still a little sketchy, and have poor developer support in comparison to Apple's App Store. 

Also, Lollipop is still nowhere to be found for the vast majority of phones. 

With that being said, I'm tempted to try an iPhone 6 Plus. I've talked to some people who use it, and they are exceedingly satisfied with the phone. Unironically here, it actually does ""just werk"". And, you know what? That's exactly what I want.

apple,"Yes, you can run and listen to music on your Apple Watch without your iPhone.","There's been a lot of misinformation being spread around how you need your iPhone to use any of the Watch's features. This is blatantly untrue.

Here are all the features you can use on the Watch, without your iPhone.

This is taken directly from the [Apple Watch overview page](http://www.apple.com/watch/overview/):

- store and play music on the Watch
- store your Passbook cards
- store photos on the Watch
- set alarms
- set timers
- set a stopwatch
- use Apple Pay
- measure your steps with the built-in accelerometer
- measure your heart rate with the built-in heart-rate sensor

The Watch even has a built-in speaker and microphone for taking phone calls. Granted, you will need your iPhone for that, but I see a lot of people completely undermining the autonomy of the Watch.

apple,Bluetooth EarPods are probably going to be released alongside the Apple Watch,"I mean, it's a bit obvious, isn't it? With Apple [directly saying](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2wzeg9/yes_you_can_run_and_listen_to_music_on_your_apple/) that you'll be able to listen to music from your Watch and the Watch having no port for headphones, one must assume that we are going to be using Bluetooth earbuds.

And whose earbuds are we going to be using? Apple's.

Apple will likely release the Bluetooth EarPods alongside or before the Apple Watch launch. Whether they'll be Apple-branded or Beats-branded remains to be seen.

I don't think Apple will include the Bluetooth EarPods with the Watch itself because... (a) it doesn't really fit in with the luxury and watchmaking experience they are going for (b) it's cheaper not to include the Bluetooth EarPods (c) listening to music on the Watch is not an essential feature on the Watch, so there's no required reason to include them, like there is with a charger.

And in case you are going to call me out for writing this without any sources, again, use your common sense. Music is allowed to be stored and played on the Watch. We need a means to listen to it. That means Bluetooth EarPods.",50,99,2015-02-24,AAPL,0.022289955988526344,0.9426957368850708,0.03501436486840248
mac,Your top apps.,"Here are my favorite apps for Mac. A lot of these mesh really well with iOS.

* Clear - simple task management app with nice gestures and themes. Syncs with the iOS version.
* Sunrise Calendar - this one also syncs with the excellent iOS version of Sunrise. It needs a lot more polish though.
* ImgUP - Upload screenshots to Imgur really quickly. If you hold Option when using the screenshot keyboard shortcut, you can automatically upload the screenshot to Imgur, with the link being copied to your clipboard. [Download here, since it's a little hard to find.](http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/Imgup.shtml)
* 1Password - the best password manager for Mac, period. Great browser extensions and it has an iOS app too. Absolutely perfect.
* Mailbox - Beta of an OS X version of iOS Mailbox. It's got the same gestures that the iOS version has.
* Safari - This is a stock app, but I felt like I should mention it because it's the best web browser on OS X. For those who don't know, Chrome is a huge battery and resource hog. Safari is far more lightweight. Laptop users, try Safari for one day and watch your battery life increase.
* Hangouts - Since Google refuses to release a Hangouts desktop client, this is the best you can get. It requires Google Chrome to be installed, but it's a relatively decent Hangouts app in its own right. No more opening Google+ or Gmail. Download from Chrome Web Store. There's the Extension and the App. Make sure you get the latter. This does take up a fair amount of battery because it must be run through Chrome, but it's better than clunky Google+.
* Steam - Obvious, but necessary for games.
* AppCleaner - Delete apps and all their included files. AppCleaner's best feature is SmartDelete, so you don't even have to open AppCleaner, just drag the app you want to delete to the Trash and AppCleaner will automatically pop up a window that will ask if you want to delete all the files scattered across the system.
* Bartender - The only program you need to organize your menu bar.
* Spotify - free, ad supported music.
* DaisyDisk - clean up your hard drive quickly. Shows an awesome map of your hard drive so you can quickly pinpoint what's taking up space.
* HyperDock - Little app previews and controls when you mouse over an icon in the dock. Also has window snapping to the side.
* Spotify Notifications - If you're listening to radio, or a playlist, rather than checking the name of the new song, a little Notification Center banner will appear that gives you the name, artist, album, and even album artwork of the song.
* MiniPlay - a really nice widget for Yosemite's Notification Center. Control Spotify, iTunes, and other programs. Looks like the iOS control center.
* Transmission - the best BitTorrent client for OS X.

apple,Changes coming to /r/Apple!,"Okay, so there have been some complaints about this subreddit, and the mods here have been talking about it. We hear you loud and clear, and we agree that something needs to be done.

Here are some of the complaints we’ve been getting:

* Too many simple tech support questions (this is the elephant in the room)
* Too many “what should I buy?” threads
* Lack of specific rules that we enforce
* Too much spam in the form of self-promotion

First, let me apologize for what may have seemed like a long time going by with your complaints falling on deaf ears. That was never the case. Changes like this take time and planning, and without consulting the other mods, it wasn’t as simple as throwing new rules out there. We had to think hard about how to handle this because if we handle it the wrong way, it will drive people away.

So I think we’ve come to a good solution. Not all of you will like it, but no idea will ever be liked by everyone. However, we feel that this will clean up a *lot* of otherwise unnecessary threads that clutter up this subreddit. This is, after all, a place where most people come looking for the latest news, rumors, and good discussion regarding Apple products.

**So without further ado, here is what’s happening:**

There will now be sanctioned threads each week that will host common questions and problems. These threads will be stickied for 24 hours on their assigned days so that they are easily found. After 24 hours, the threads will still be available for you to post to - they simply won’t be stickied anymore. On non-event days, the APPreciation thread will return to being stickied. Here’s the event schedule, which can also be found in the sidebar soon:

| **Topic**                   | **Time Posted**         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Tech Support Tuesday        | Tuesday @ 9am EST   |
| What Should I Buy Wednesday | Wednesday @ 9am EST |
| Self-Promotion Saturday     | Saturday @ 9am EST  |

**Tech Support Tuesday** will be for ALL tech support questions. We realize that /r/applehelp is a ghost town, and sending people there was kind of useless. We want people to get the help they need, but at the same time, it’s overwhelming /r/apple. This is good news for everyone! Not only will it clean things up, but there will be a central location for tech support questions, therefore having more eyes on common issues. It will also cut down on questions that get asked too often because the common questions will rise to the top.

**What Should I Buy Wednesday** is for anyone wondering what Apple product they should buy. This will range from people not understanding the difference between models of a MacBook Pro to questions regarding whether or not they should hold off on buying something because MacBook Air rumors have been making rounds.

**Self-Promotion Saturday** is for all developers and the like who want to showcase their own creations! This is important to the community because we know there are a lot of people who want to get the word out about their new app or Kickstarter accessory. We don’t want this subreddit to be filled with what is essentially spam, so this thread will be a great place to talk about your own stuff.

We won’t be deleting threads right away because we want to ease into this new system. But in a few weeks, we’re going to get pretty strict about it. Any thread that is created outside of these scheduled events will be deleted and the OP will be notified of the correct place to ask a question or post about their app.

However, we DO reserve the right to let a thread remain every once in a while because it is creating a good discussion. This might be due to a very specific tech support issue that is unique or a Reddit official posting about Alien Blue. The mods will make this call, but the goal is for 95% of these types of posts to remain inside the sanctioned threads each week.

Another issue we’ve been made aware of is a lack of specified rules in the sidebar. So that we’re more clear about what types of posts and comments are allowed here, these rules will be going into effect immediately:

**Rules**

1. No ~~image posts~~ memes or image posts designed for easy karma.
2. No NSFW content.
3. No ~~complaints or~~ threads designed as rants (please message the mods if you have a specific concern).
4. No editorialized link titles (use the original article’s title when possible).
5. No rude, offensive, or hateful comments.
6. No posts that aren’t directly related to Apple or the Apple eco-system.
7. No technical support questions (see the event schedule for more information).
8. No spam or self-promotion (see the event schedule for more information).
9. No posts or comments related to piracy.
10. No selling, trading, or asking to purchase devices. 
11. No unauthorized giveaways (please message the mods if you would like to do a promotion).

We hope that these new guidelines will provide a better subreddit for you. Again, we know there is going to be a transition period, so we aren’t going to be super strict about thread creation for at least a few weeks. Instead, we will simply comment inside the thread with direction. We encourage you to post inside the thread as well, if you’d like, to educate users on the new rules and event threads.

If you have any questions or concerns, please discuss below! We will begin this new schedule on Monday, March 2, so there’s still time to get ideas in if you have a suggestion.

Thanks for your patience!

apple,New Macs March 9th,"I work in a large UK Electrical retailer, similar to a particular spicy Indian food ;)

Anyway, we noticed today when checking stock and availability for a customer that all models of iMac, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro cannot be ordered and are shown as ""Not Due"" for delivery. This usually happens when Apple halts shipments due to product refreshes. I think it's a safe bet that at least these 3 Mac lines will be updated come March 9th.

EDIT: Photo proof of the stock availability:

apple,If you haven't already changed your thermal paste....,"I own a Late 2008 Macbook unibody, and lately the temps of the macbook were insane, until today. I was reading up on how Apple applies way to much thermal paste from the factory and boy were they right. I got around to opening the case and pulled the logic board earlier today. Looked at the thermal paste and it just seemed like they put it there. No real care for it working or not. 
Here:

Anyways, I cleaned up the thermal paste, and reapplied Arctic Silver 5. It made a huge difference!

Temp at Idle before were roughly 55-60 degrees celsius. 
Temp at Idle after are at 40 degrees celsius. 

Temp with Google Chrome/Mail/iTunes: Now it's not the most scientific way to measure it because I had different tabs open for chrome, but this is what I got.. 
Before: 75~85 celsius
After: 50~60 Celsius
