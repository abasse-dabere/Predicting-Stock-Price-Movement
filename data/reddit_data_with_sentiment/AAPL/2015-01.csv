iphone,I think I fried my Iphone,"Okay, so here is the story:

I received a gift from my sister which is one of those ""Mini-speakers for your MP3 device"" and it has a cord which has 3 plugs. One plug is a usb port to give the battery a charge, the other plug is is for the audio jack in a MP3 device (my Iphone in this case) and another plug is for the back of the mini-speaker which delivers both the power supply and the audio.

I wasn't sure which plug was for the power supply and which was for the audio jack (they look really familiar and the power supply one reminded me of a plug for a pair of headphones I had earlier in life) so I ended up plugging in the one that delivers the power supply and audio into my Iphone 5's audio port. Next thing I know my screen starts going black and just blackens to show nothing but still has a dim light so I know it's on (I even had one of my friends try to call me and they said it didn't go directly to voice-mail).

What I'm wondering is if there is a fix to it? Hopefully there is because I don't believe my contract is up for another month or so :(

TLDR: Plugged a Power supply cord for a mini-speaker into my Iphone audio jack, screen went black and can't get it to work (turn on or off).

apple,Blown away today by Apple,"For the past month my computer has been in and out of repairs. Its been a pain because Im trying to finish incomplete's from last spring semester, and also been doing a lot of internship work as well. 

I first sent it in, and it came back, and it crashed. So I went to the Apple Store in the Galleria in Saint Louis, MO. 5 days later, I got it back again, and sadly crashed once more. Last week I dropped it off the day after Christmas, and today I got it back once more. This was the 3rd time and they basically replaced everything. I got home and started to restore my back up, when once again it crashed. 

I was so annoyed, upset but mostly frustrated at the fact this kept happening. I called the store and spoke with the Apple Tech head guy and he told me to bring everything in, and we would go from there. 

I got to the store with an hour left before they closed, and when he came out with a new computer I was shocked. The new computer is the more advanced of the Macbook family, and it will come in handy with my photography company. The whole time the Store Manager, Apple Genius guys, and floor people checked up on me as my brand new computer restored. They even let my Dad and I stay after they closed to finish everything. They answered all of my questions, and my parents and they were so sweet and understanding.

iphone,Upgrading from an iPhone 4,"So I'm finally deciding to upgrade my 16GB 4 after a good 3.5 years of use, however I'm torn between getting the 5S or the 6 which are both already a huge upgrade for me.

My question is...is there a huge difference between the 5S and the 6? What's most appealing to me about the 5S is the choice of 32GB storage space which I think will be ideal for me. The 64GB 6 is way too much and I'm not sure if the 16GB will be enough (will mostly likely use Spotify/Pandora, maybe 7-8 casual games and 8-10 other apps like I am at the moment and casual photography...I like to keep my phone relatively clean with only useful things on it). My current 16GB phone has been just fine so far, but I've heard about how app sizes are getting larger and whatnot and I will likely use it more often since I'm starting university/college.

People have also been saying I need to ""future-proof"" my phone and therefore get the 6 because it's the latest model. The phone will come on a 2 year contract, so will the 5S be sufficient for 2 years worth of upgrades?

I don't plan on buying outright from places like eBay, nor do I plan on selling it afterwards because I will probably pass it on to family members.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",10.0,7,2015-01-03,AAPL,0.01572912000119686,0.8929380178451538,0.09133285284042358
iphone,Best insurance for iPhone 6? Applecare+ vs AT&amp;T vs self-insuring.,"Wife and I bought two new iPhone 6s last month and are near the end of the period where we can decide to get the AT&amp;T insurance. $10/month per phone is rapey, but it covers theft and loss which is pretty much the only thing AppleCare+ doesn't cover.

*Note: I am purchasing the phone via AT&amp;T NEXT 18, not on a contract, so I will owe the remaining cost of the phone if it is lost/stolen. That is what is driving my question.*

I put together a comparison of the three possibilities (AT&amp;T, AppleCare, and self-insured i.e. just eat the cost) and you can [see it here](http://i.imgur.com/MydkgYm.png). The left side shows the paydown of the phone over 24 months. The right side shows the cost to replace at any given month. The no insurance option includes $75 tax paid up front to replace the phone. AT&amp;T is the cumulative monthly cost + $199 deductible. AppleCare is the cost of the phone + $99 for the insurance. (because I would still have to replace the phone at my own cost)

The red shows where the cost of the insurance exceeds the cost of the phone. AppleCare always costs more if the phone is lost/stolen. AT&amp;T doesn't cost more until month 16.

I'm curious what others think. I've always heard ""just get AppleCare+"" which was my intention, but the loss/theft coverage is what has me hesitant. Never been mugged or had anything stolen, but also never carried an $800 thief magnet in my pocket either.

I hate the idea of getting the AT&amp;T insurance, so can anyone give me good reasons not to?

ipad,Going to buy an iPad or bought one in the past 60 days? Get the Applecare + or a warranty,"I've been seeing a lot of posts lately about broken screens or dropped iPads.  It must be a very crushing experience.

However it happens to the best of us, in order to protect the screen from cracking with a fall from shoulder height, you would have to have a pretty substantial (and IMO ugly) case

when the screen is cracked the options to fix it aren't pretty, you spent 6-800 bucks on the ipad only to have to shell out more money for a replacement by apple, or go with one of the chinese screen kits that aren't as good as the original gorilla glass

Why not just pay the 99 bucks for applecare +   you can get up to 2 replacements of accidental damage for a fee of 49 per incident

https://www.apple.com/support/products/ipad.html

other companies offer warranties as well, squaretrade for example doesn't even have a service fee

I like to use mine without a case, and have the peace of mind that if something were to happen god forbid I'm covered

apple,"Does OS X need another ""Leopard"" release?","With all the recent talk of quality issues in Apple's OS and of people leaving the ecosystem for other platforms like Linux - it has made me wonder whether OS X needs another ""Leopard"" release.

At the time, OS X Leopard (10.5) caught people's attention by focusing almost exclusively on fixing bugs and making the OS as stable as possible.  Some consumers were disappointed that Leopard didn't include some big new marquee features similar to previous releases (Spotlight, etc.) but most prosumers were overjoyed that Apple was spending the time eliminating nagging problems with the OS rather than just stacking more problems on.

apple,Performance issues with Apple TV and Airplay Streaming,"Hi fellow applers,

Here's my setup :

- Latest Apple TV connected with ethernet
- MacBook pro retina 13' over wifi

When streaming audio or video to my Apple TV, there are usually HUGE performance issues, like 1 second the streaming works, the next second there is silence, and so on.

I played with the settings on my mac and my Apple TV and somehow it worked just right for a moment.

I immediately tried to stream from my SO's Imac and she had the huge issues as well, whereas from my laptop it worked just fine.

Few hours after that I tried to stream one more time from my laptop and the issues were present again, after a few tries it finally worked but I can't manage to understand why sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.

Does anyone have any idea on how to troubleshoot that ?

Here's what I already tried w/o success :

- Streaming from 2.4Ghz wifi instead of 5ghz
- Changing resolutions of the macbook and the quality of the apple TV streaming

apple,Opinion: Would you Prefer a two-year Update Cycle Instead of One?,"I keep seeing this question pop up and I am curious what the Apple fan base thinks. For the past few years now, every major OS update by Apple has contained bugs. Bugs that Apple has in the past not allowed to make its' way into public releases.

That most likely means that Apple's engineers cannot keep up with demand. By the time they find out a bug has made it to the public, they have already been developing the next software release for two months and it goes to the back burner.

Instead of Apple releasing new hardware and software revamps every year like they do with iOS and iPhone, would you prefer that they release new products every two years instead? It seems logical that the end result would be better if they had more time to perfect it. It would also allow users to keep their devices longer without them being obsolete and for app developers to not be constantly playing catch-up with the latest software versions. However, other companies such as Samsung might view it as a point of decline for Apple.

iphone,"Help! Nonfunctional iPhone3GS screen with all other aspects working, need a backup to iTunes. Trying to project iPhone onto a monitor.","Hello World,

This is my first post on Reddit and it is so unfortunate for it to be out of desperation. 

I dropped the brand new version of the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS, onto the floor and when I went to use it the screen appeared white. It is running iOS 6.1.6, capacity is 16 GB(13.57). 

Don't ask me to hard restart, it doesn't change. All executive functions appear to be A OK including the home button, lock button, the phone itself (receives calls, asks to leave a voice-mail, the phone is completely recognized on iTunes,) but the iPhone cannot be backed up because it requires that I unlock it prior. This is obviously impossible because of the inaccessibility of the screen. 

My first thought was obviously to try to unlock it using muscle memory. I either am always failing at pressing the keys at the right places or the screen is non-responsive. My second thought is to attack it to a monitor. Perhaps I can get a 30-pin to hdmi converter? 

I also ask the reddit community if there are any known easy fixes to a white screen. This would completely bypass the issue at hand. 

On another note, I think this is completely ridiculous. I've backed up this phone multiple times on this computer, it's never asked me to unlock the phone, how does Apple expect backing up super^sweg and restoring to work when passwords are forgotten? It's a familiar computer, both end devices know that, it shows my music library, my new wallpaper, my apps, but it can't back up my contacts! It seems ludicrous!

apple,Bought my first Mac - thanks for all the advice,"I don't normally bother with follow up posts but everyone here was so helpful when I asked for advice I thought I would this time.

I went with a 13"" Macbook Pro (Oct 2013) from the refurbished Australian store. It has an I5 2.6ghz, 16gb ram and a 512gb ssd. It was a little over $2000 with an (overpriced) ethernet to lightning adaptor, saving about $500 off a similarly specced new model.

I've only had it for a few hours but I'm really happy with the purchase. It looks, feels and runs like it's brand new and I think it's going to be perfect to travel with. I haven't had a chance to do anything too processor heavy (I will be using it for video editing in my travels) but so far it's been very snappy and responsive.

It hasn't been too hard to adjust to the new system, considering I've used nothing but Windows for the last 20 years. I'm loving a lot of the gesture shortcuts on the trackpad and also the responsiveness of it in general. I don't think I will ever get used to command+c etc for copy and paste though, hopefully there is a way to switch it to fn+c to make it feel a little more natural to me.

Thanks again for all the advice, it was really surprising to see so many replies to my vague and nooby posts, I really appreciate it.

Edit: I probably should elaborate a little on my experience with the refurbished store. It may not apply to all regions but I have been watching it very closely over the last 2-3 weeks, getting a feel for pricing and general availability.

There has been a 512gb i5 model with 8gb ram listed in the store constantly for that whole time for a little under $1800. I was considering this and decided the extra ram was worth it, and would help retain value in the long run. In the whole time watching the store, usually checking it every few hours of the day I only noticed a 16gb model appear briefly two times.

The first time I wasn't sure if it was worth it and posted here for advice and by the time I had submitted my post and refreshed the store it was already gone.

The second time the 16gb model would appear briefly, and usually be 'out of stock' when I clicked on it and then gone from the list when I went back and refreshed. This happened a few times until I eventually saw the add to cart button and snagged it. I'm assuming this was from people adding to their cards and not buying it.

Either way it seems 16gb refurbished 13"" models are a little rare so if you're after one you need to check constantly and don't hesitate when one is listed.",10.0,9,2015-01-14,AAPL,0.051589760929346085,0.9165143370628357,0.0318959541618824

iphone,Tempered glass screen protector for iPhone 6 WITH bezel,"I'm wondering if any of you might have an idea where to find a particular tempered glass screen protector that I purchased on my travels through hong kong last winter. 

This particular protector is of importance to me because unlike other conventional ones that you might buy on Amazon, this protector actually covers the entire black bezel right up to where it meets the aluminium unibody. 

I don't know whether this actually adds better protection but I like it MUCH better for completeness sake and in addition, it happens to sit flush with my case.

I don't know the brand but if necessary I can take my current one off (which recently broke) and link some photos.

* Rearranging Apps?

* Alarms... uhm i don't know why i would do that but maybe to get notificated when bus should come at bus stop

* Maybe watch planets &amp;  sun but this is just playing around and only works as watchfaces (Plz apple, port these to iOS 9)

apple,The Switch: From a 2011 MBP to rMBP 2014,"This last week, I decided to take the plunge and upgrade my slowly fading early 2011 Macbook Pro 13', to the 2014 rMBP 13'. And may I say, the upgrade has been *amazing*. Wait, actually it's been *extraordinary*. Let me explain why.

First of all, I will add that I am not a very heavy user by any means, but there is a point in every computers lifespan where it becomes **unbearable**. This was that time. 

My 2011 MBP lasted me a long 4 years, and it was a champ. It could handle everything I had to throw at it, and never struggled with anything. *Until 6 months ago.*

It would simply crash at any given moment without reason, and would overheat **very** quickly. This is when I decided that I needed to make an upgrade. After many days of looking at comparisons, reviews etc. I finally made my decision. *I will upgrade to the Retina Macbook Pro 13' 2014 Model*. And man, could I have not made a better decision. The difference in speed was **Night** and **Day**. The retina screen, was indeed beautiful. And quite frankly, every aspect of the machine was *perfect*.  

Even more of a reason to upgrade was the big weight difference. Like, **MASSIVE** weight difference. (For example, I can actually take my computer in my bag without having back pain.) 

*Now I did encounter one problem.* Deciding between the 13' and the 15' Pro.

My answer to that problem is this,
      If you do **MASSIVE** amounts of work, video editing, editing huge            spreadsheets etc. the 15' is for you. If you are like the vast majority of users who do basic tasks, the 13' is for you. 

All in all, I have to say this is one of my best purchases I have made in the last year. Nothing compares to this amazing machine, no matter what. (Design, speed, etc.) [Except the 15' rMBP obviously :P]

TL;DR: The difference between the non-retina and retina Macbook Pro 13' is **NIGHT AND DAY**. I personally would suggest this computer to ANYONE.

iphone,I made an app that combines the clothes in your wardrobe into outfits. And now I need some help and feedback to make it perfect.,"Hello,

I'm a solo app developer that has made this app over the last year during whatever free hour I could find. I wanted to know more about style and how to combine clothes, and this app is basically a lot of the knowledge I picked up.

This is an app that combines clothes into outfits. The idea is simple, you take pictures of your clothes, and the app will attempt to combine them based on your skin, eye and hair color.

If you want, the app can also look at a database of store items to combine with your wardrobe. But I still need to fill up the database with more garments. So right now it is quite barren.

My next step now is to get feedback on the app so I can improve the useability. And I'm really hoping the reddit community can help me out there. I have set up : http://welldressed.kickoffpages.com/ to get email adressess for beta testing. Anyone that signs up I will invite to join our beta.

iphone,"Looking to sell your iPhone? Stay Away from ""eBay for the Win"" Promotion.","Back in late November, I decided to sell my 5S. I searched around and settled on eBay because of the ""eBay for the Win"" promotion that they had going. As a quick summary, as long as I listed my phone for 7 days with a starting price of their choice ($264.00 for a black, unlocked, 32GB 5S), they would guarantee a selling price. If it did not sell for this price, I would receive an eBay coupon to make up the difference. When I listed, the guaranteed price was $447.00, which I thought was pretty fair.

Predictably, the phone didn't get much attention until the last minutes of the listing. It ended up selling for $360.00 to a guy in California. Seemed a bit low but I didn't mind since I would be getting the coupon and there are plenty of things I could pick up on eBay.

A few weeks went by and I had received no coupon. I searched around the promotional page and it doesn't have a single sentence on how you receive the coupon. I called in an spoke to an agent who was nice enough. He told me that I would see the coupon added on to my account for the difference in a few days. He wasn't sure why it hadn't been added already.

A month later, it still wasn't there. I called a few days ago and spoke to an agent (after 20 minutes on hold) who said he would process the request again and that I should receive the coupon in an email. This time, I asked him for a confirmation number so I could reference it when I had to call back because I had no faith that it would show up.

Obviously, I never received an email. I called today and spent 31 minutes waiting on hold before finally speaking with an agent. After being put on hold for various amounts of time, she finally got back to me saying that eBay would not be giving me a coupon. Shortly after the listing was created, I realized I had the ""shipping from"" address set to where I used to live. I updated the listing to reflect the new city. Doing this had disqualified me from the promotion. I understand why they prohibit making changes to the listing; they obviously don't want me changing the listing price or duration. However, changing the location did nothing. I was still shipping it for free and I still did it the day the listing was over. In fact, the user who purchased it likely received it faster because of my new location.

I asked to be transferred up to a supervisor. Queue 20 more minutes on hold before I finally spoke to someone. The supervisor ended up telling me the exact same thing and wouldn't budge. For reference, this was my first sale on eBay but I have a long history of purchases. I told her there was no way I was ever going to use eBay again if they wouldn't give me the coupon. I asked for some sort of compromise--at least give me a portion of the $87.00 I was supposed to receive. She said she couldn't do that but said I should check out the other promotions they have going on for selling items. I hate to be cliche but I couldn't believe she had the nerve to tell me that. I had been cool and collected throughout the whole call, despite having made 3 calls and spent two hours on the phone dealing with issues they kept saying would be resolved.

Finally, I said ""Fuck this."" and I hung up.

apple,Magic Trackpad gestures not working [X-Post from /r/AppleHelp],"I got no answers in /r/AppleHelp, so I'm posting here as well.

&gt; Occasionally, when I use my Magic Trackpad, some gestures stop working, and the only way for me to fix it (that I know of), is to restart the computer, or wait. 

&gt; One example go this is when browsing in Safari and trying to swipe back, the tab freezes, and I can't scroll up or down, yet alone swipe back or fourth. It stays like this, freezing whenever i try to swipe back, for about 30-45 min. Then it goes back to normal.  
Another example is sometimes, four-finger gestures stop working, which includes swipe between full-screen apps/desktops, Mission Control and Launchpad.  
However, these two behaviors never seem to happen at once...

&gt; Here are the things that I have used to try and fix it:  

&gt; Disconnecting the trackpad, then connecting to it again (doesn't work)  
Turning the trackpad off and on again (doesn't work)  

&gt;    killall Dock (doesn't work)
Waiting (works, after 30-45 min)  
Restarting the computer (works, but gets annoying because this happens about 4 times per day)

&gt; Does anybody know a solution?

&gt; Edit: It seems only the safari freezing goes away after waiting. The four-finger gestures doesn't seem to go away unless you restart the computer :(",5.0,9,2015-01-19,AAPL,0.20100319385528564,0.7769186496734619,0.022078147158026695

However, since upgrading from my 4, I've noticed that the app 'closes' if I don't use it for a few hours. For example, when I first open it in the morning (which I need to, in order to receive incoming calls), it shows the RingCentral loading screen, and then subsequent openings will go straight to the call log screen, indicating the phone app is already active. However, after lunch, I go to see if I got any missed calls, and the app shows the loading screen again as if it shut down. Also, it seems that other people have picked up my calls, suggesting it did in fact close out.

iphone,iPhone 5 broken by cash-only repair shop... guessing I'm out of luck?,"This shop had 40+ reviews on Yelp, 4.5 average, so I figured they had to be at good. Well, I had an absolutely horrendous experience in more ways than one, and by the time it sank in it was too late. All the 5 star reviews have GOT to be friends of the owner, or just people who got extremely lucky.

I took it in noon Friday for screen replacement. The crack was a nasty one but he assured me he could fix it. Evidently he couldn't, since he pushed back the pickup time from 7 PM Friday to 11 AM Saturday to 3 PM Saturday. And the phone just crashed this morning. I just came from a different repair guy who told me it is completely fried from overheating via heat gun. So it's a lost cause. Even worse is the place was cash-only so pretty much impossible to dispute right?

Do I ask for just ask for the $100 repair fee or go so far as to ask for partial compensation for my phone? Obviously I'll threaten with a nasty review if I have to although I don't know that will help. I'm pretty sure he will refuse both and I know he has all the power here but I'm out of a $200 phone and $100 repair fee right now and just fuming.

The only thing that works is to restart the phone.

Did a full phone factory reset, no restore, manually reset up the entire phone (a couple of hours of work obviously)... Fixed! For the next month... Then a couple of days ago, back to the good old syncing issues. Spin, nothing, restart, good, two days, no sync...

it is very possible that you saw my post here about [my first game for iOS developed using Swift and Spritekit called Shapestr](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shapestr/id944822828).

Many of you guys tried it out and most of you liked it, it looked like I might be able to get the attention of iOS users and have a good stable flow of downloads going, but it never really happened.

So, after 2 months since the release, with +-1K downloads and nearly no new users, I am here again, trying to find out where did I go wrong with this app. Is the whole game boring? Should I go for a paid advertisement? Are there any major defects that make it unenjoyable? Please redditors, tell me your opinion, since I am really desperate to find out! :)

apple,Ignored Reddits advice and bought a 2010 white Macbook.,"I *love* this thing. It's running Yosemite perfectly, along with the battery only ever having been used 9 times, according to system preferences. Clean, fast, nice on the eyes. Everyone told me I should get a Chromebook instead for my needs, but I'm so much happier with this. It looks nicer (despite the dated screen resolution), it runs an actual operating system, and it has enough power to run all of the programs I actually use - albeit I doubt it could handle the excessive amount of workloads that people use for benchmarks and to inexplicably gauge daily use for a more typical, casual user. I'm not exactly sitting here running Battlefield 4 and three different photoshop variants simultaneously or anything. 

My advice to anyone with low usage needs who's looking for a cheap laptop: Go for a used 2010 unibody Macbook. I can't see how you'd ever be happier with a Chromebook or cheap Windows laptop.

apple,"Announcing Apollo: a brand new, gorgeous Reddit app for iPhone (xpost: /r/iPhone)","Hey all!

I've been building a brand new Reddit app for iPhone over the last year, and I'm finally at the stage where I can announce it to all you lovely people. It's called [Apollo](http://apolloapp.io).

I've been a Redditor for about 4 years now and for a lot of that I've been craving an iPhone app that makes Reddit amazing. I was lucky enough to get hired at Apple last summer as an iOS intern, and I learned a ton from some really smart people that I've poured into this app. 

I put a real emphasis on making an app that makes Reddit feel right at home on the iPhone and super comfortable to browse, with beautifully large thumbnails, smooth gestures, really nicely organized comments, a super fast way to jump between subreddits, a lot of great features from iOS 8, and the great features Reddit offers (view gilded comments!), and a lot more. You can also toggle to smaller thumbnails if you prefer. I'm really proud of the result, and it's the client I'm using day to day now. 

[Here's a few screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/UVJrx)

It's not quite ready to launch yet, but I'd love to get some input from the community on what they think so far, and what they'd love to see in their perfect Reddit app. I'm also going to be opening a public beta in the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for that if you want to get an early look. :)

If you want to get notified when it's released, I made a [website that you can sign up at](http://apolloapp.io), and there's also a subreddit that I'll be posting updates to: /r/apolloapp

I'd really love to hear your initial impressions and what you'd like to see. :)",647.0,913,2015-01-30,AAPL,0.018534740433096886,0.9123336672782898,0.06913157552480698

iphone,"6+ users, why did you choose the 6+ over the 6? How have you liked it? Any regrets?","**Update for anyone doing what I did before I purchased the phone and searching reddit for any comparison posts:**

I went with the 6+ and could not be happier. I got used to the size in about 48 hrs and could not imagine going back. I have large hands but not huge by any means, it is a two-handed phone but feels very natural to do so. I am able to one-hand for most things (casual instagram browsing, reddit, etc.) 

The battery life is a thing of absolute beauty–this week I had to travel to Chicago for the day for business and was amazed that I made it through the whole day of no wi-fi, GPS, heavy, near-constant use, music, etc. and ended up with 30% battery at the end of the day. 

The camera has exceeded my expectations. My shaky-hand problem has all but been resolved. I am so impressedwith the picture quality with every picture I take. 

The screen is really beautiful as well, just as a plus. Overall, couldn't be happier with my purchase. I couldn't imagine my fiancee with this phone, it's surely not for everyone–but it is 100% for me.
