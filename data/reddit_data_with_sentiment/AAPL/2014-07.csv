apple,What I've observed on /r/apple over the last few months.,"I like this subreddit. There is, most of the time, a plethora of content and insightful discussions being posted regularly, but this subreddit has a growing tendency towards suppressing general discussion on certain topics. This is not a list, more just a roll(/rant) of thoughts.

- More often than not, discussions center around trashing on competitors. I've seen more armchair CEO comments criticizing Microsoft's Windows Phone, Android and obscure arguments of hate against companies taken to personal levels, than value added discussions concerning IOS.
- Click-bait articles on hype are becoming common-place.
- The bandwagon-effect is increasingly prevalent; criticising Lenovo and other brands for a ""me too"" approach with their products... come on people... beating on a Thinkpad for opting to include an optical drive...? Why?
- Discussions turn to flame-wars; users posting comments about Waze or GMaps in the comments section of many Apple Maps articles/posts are down-voted, despite adding extremely insightful or relevant content to the discussion.

I might be downvoted for this post, or for not convincingly articulating exactly what I'm trying to convey, but this subreddit is becoming click-bait central.

iphone,My app Stitch It! (the only iOS app for capturing long screenshots) is now free! [corrected price change],"Stitch It! ([available here](http://goo.gl/SULS6)) is now free!  Forever!

In case you aren't familiar with Stitch It! -- I made this app to allow you to capture and share long images on your iPhone or iPod touch (here's an example of the full-res images you can capture with it: http://i.imgur.com/NLuSNU0.jpg).

As you can see, it's great for dumb pun threads, incriminating text messages, email correspondences you'd like to save... anything you can scroll through on your iPhone, *Stitch It!* can turn into a single image to be saved and/or shared.  It has Reddit, Imgur, SMS and email sharing options (among others) built right in.

We've given the whole app a beautiful facelift, and decided that **LONG SCREENSHOTS ARE FOR THE PEOPLE** so we're making it free.  It will be supported with ads, but if you'd like to get rid of them (or if you'd like to support us) you can pay a dollar to have them removed.  Anyone who bought Stitch It! when it was a paid app will be able to remove the ads for free.

If you like the app, please please please give us a nice review in the App Store (our visible reviews reset to 0 with this update).  Enjoy!

apple,"FaceTime, why can't you be more like Messages (and Snapchat)?","Having a separate app for FaceTime really dampens its utility.  It should be integrated into Phone.

Then, when both parties are on WiFi, Phone should automatically initiate a FaceTime Audio call instead of normal telephony.  Obviously, a user should be able to turn this off, or allow automatic incoming FT Audio even while on cell data.

FaceTime Video should work like Snapchat, which is a superior model for video calling. You can opt into video after an Audio conversation has started, and the other person is never pressured to enabled video at your behest (as is sadly the case with today's FaceTime Video).  With this model, the monikers ""FaceTime Audio"" and ""FaceTime Video"" pretty much go away, blending into Phone.

So, the scenario: you call Jack from home. Jack is out, but he has enabled automatic FT over cell data, so when he picks up, your audio is crystal clear.  You press a button, and show Jack that your iPad mini has arrived. Jack presses a button and you see that he is walking into an Apple Store to get one himself!

This is a much happier and more natural vision for FaceTime. If it will ever be more than a gimmick, it needs to be integrated seamlessly with how people use their phones for voice. iMessage is much better integrated with SMS, and Snapchat's video works better because you opt in and it's one-way by default.

apple,"Siri could benefit from a ""Remembering"" feature","Reminders are great for 90% of the things I need Siri to remind me about, but there are other times when I need her to remember things. Times when I need information that is not formatted to a date or place. 

Ex: ""Siri, remember my wife's favorite flower is a Hydrangea""

* ""Remember my locker combination is  17,6,3""

* ""Remember my printer uses 211XL ink""

* ""Remember my niece's shoe size is 5"" 
* or ""Siri, remember the color I painted my room is Silver Sage""

 (These examples are what I've needed Siri to remember in the last two weeks)

Then you could go back and ask Siri ""Do you remember my locker combination?"" And she could recite it to you without you having to prompt her when to remind you. I don't always know when or where I'll need certain information again so it is hard to set reminders. However, if Siri could remember things for me that would be so amazing.

apple,Life time Windows user. My experience with my new mac.,"So, I have seen a few posts here detailing peoples experiences from moving to iOS from android and vice versa. Here is my experiences and thoughts on OSX

I have been a life time windows user starting from my first desktop which was a windows 95 all in one compaq machine when I was in school in late 2000. Trust me, doing work on NOTEPAD is really not good karma!

I then got a new desktop in 2005 and laptop in about 2006 which both ran windows XP. I finally had MS word this time around. So Karma +. Finally upgraded those to windows 7 machines in late 2010. 

This week, that all changed. I got myself after working hard for 2 months a Macbook Pro 15"". First impressions, this thing is an absolute beauty! Feels great and looks incredibly beautiful. This is probably because I come from a world of hewlett packard plastics.

So, I got this thing set up, rather easily. Wifi, apple id and that was it. I was thinking I was missing something at this point because set up was so seamless and quick. I realised I had no bloatware to uninstall, or antivirus to install. I was done. which was a bit of a shock considering.

Then I thought ahh, need to add my printer. settings&gt;printers&gt; Add.. Done. Drivers automatic, network printer detected automatically...  I thought oh, how nice. 

Logged in to my google account in system preferences.. My calendar had synced, my mail and contacts all come over (a little fiddly with these one time ""app specific"" passwords but still easy enough. 

For me, one of THE biggest thing I am amazed about is application installation. Mount, drag drop done. and the to delete, drag it into the bin. Gone are the days of that ""Install Wizard"" (Who I don't believe is a real wizard anyway) and the thousands up on thousands of DLL files.

The speakers on this thing are like nothing I have ever had on a notebook computer. For something without a subwoofer, it has some bass and depth to the music. Which was a hell of a surprise.

The screen however is like nothing I have ever seen! It is kind of hard to explain, but its kind of like looking at something that you need to tale a double take at because you don't quite believe that it can be so clear.

To give you an idea on how impressed my brother was. He put a photo from his USB on to the MacBook, (as an amateur photographer he has always used a windows based laptop for editing) He was absolutely dumbfounded but its clarity. So much so, he ordered the 256gb 15"" mbp after 5 mins of using mine.

There is so much to say about this and I feel I have not even scratched the surface of it, There are little features for example the screen and keyboard auto react to the lighting conditions that I am still discovering. Not started backing it up yet I am getting a HDD for that in a week or so but I believe it is just as simple as everything else! 

A couple of niggles which I assume is more to do with inexperience. 
1. Folders and files not flowing when the window is extended...
2. A few apps and icons not retina ready (icons like caffeine that I am manually updating) However I know that is totally a dev thing not an apple thing.
3 My muscle memory is still adjusting. CTRL doesn't do what CTRL does on windows and emails being email""email.com with the @ being now above the 2 (I am using a british Keyboard)  but that is about it

so to conclude my waffle, thanks to apple for creating such a mind blowing product, and I wish my dad has got my an old Macintosh rather than that Windows 95 compaq; but hay every cloud has a silver lining, and this would be that I wouldn't now be able to appreciate the experiences that I am having today with this amazing machine.",506,672,2014-07-07,AAPL,0.038391273468732834,0.9283705949783325,0.03323812782764435

apple,Clean your Macbook!,"After getting annoyed that my MBP (Mid 2010) was running extremely hot all the time, fans spinning up just doing basic things I decided to find out why. 

I ran iStat and I was about 76-80˚ C when idle (about 170F). After looking online I found that it wasn't normal, and it definitely wasn't what I remembered.

I took the back off the machine and gave it a good blow and got a little dust out but there wasn't anything I could really see. So I followed this guide on iFixit:

https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2010+Heat+Sink+Replacement/3102

This describes how to replace the heatsink. I wasn't going to replace it, but I did have a can of air and some thermal paste ready. As soon as I lifted up the logic board I found the reason why it was running so hot. The heatsink fins were clogged with shit, almost to the point where they were totally blocked.

After cleaning everything and reapplying the thermal paste it now runs around 42˚ C while idle. A little under half what it used to be.

It's also super quiet now!

apple,MacBook Pro resurrected.,"This pretty much was utterly amazing.

I've been in the hunt for another MacBook, preferably a Pro and I found one on Craigslist.

I was optimistic. Apparently the guy was the original owner. Had had it new in '09 and ""supposedly"" the only thing wrong was the keyboard no longer worked. It was a great price (I thought) and at worse - it would be a desktop in the office - at best maybe I could repair/replace whatever was wrong.

Probing further, apparently there was some liquid damage very shortly after purchasing it that led to the keyboard malfunction and optical drive no longer working and he just left it that way and used it as a ""desktop.""

I thought the Mac was worth the risk as it included a new Apple Bluetooth keyboard and 2 power adapters. I took it off his hands and brought it home.
To my dismay several of the keys had been literally taped on to keep the appearance (I assume).

Suddenly the trackpad started malfunctioning and I started to really worry I got totally taken. Then I decided to strip it down and clean everything with air and alcohol and see where that got me. 

5 hours later - I have a fully functional Unibody MacBook Pro with Mavericks; minus the few keys that were taped &amp; the optical drive (That I'll replace with a caddy later)

For 5 years it sat, sticky and under utilized and 1 thorough cleaning ( PSA - those who aren't comfortable around sensitive electronics - don't attempt this risky bizness) and several piles of cotton swabs later brought it back to life.

Amazing hardware. I seriously doubt my old Dell could come anywhere near that reliability.

Is there anything I missing? 

Once I do that I need to figure out a way to rig one device to move in order to engage the parallax effect. Any ideas that don't involve me jiggling the device for several minutes?

It was buried so deep in there that I have no idea how long it's been there. Me and my roommate entertain guests frequently, and there has probably been over 100+ people that have sat on that couch since the 5S came out. We posted a memo on Facebook about it, but nobody claimed it. 

It is currently deactivated, because there is no signal and Siri will not connect. Also, it is passcode locked so we can't get into the phone. Any advice on how we can return this to it's original owner? As far as I remember, the Apple Store won't give out any personal information so if we bring it to them, they probably won't be any help. 

EDIT: I plugged it into my computer but all it came up with was 'My iPhone'. Couldn't access any more information, but I did a factory reset and when It came back to the new home page, it displayed the message, ""This iPhone was lost. Please call ###-###-####"". So I texted the number, and am waiting to hear back! Thanks for all your advice.

apple,2 TB time capsule is ~2x as expensive as products with similar features. What are you getting for that extra money?,"This is not a post complaining about the ""apple tax."" I'm fully aware of the hardware quality, integration with macs, and superior customer support. Mostly, I'm curious if there are specific hardware specifications that make it stand out.

Thanks!

***Edit: After reading the comments, I realized that I overlooked the fact that it includes a router – a feature I previously believed was only in the AirPort Extreme. Obviously, I didn't read the product specifications for apple's airport family of products carefully enough. I'd been comparing the time capsule to the external hard drives other companies sell that connect to your computer wirelessly over wifi for backups. The price makes a lot more sense now, and is not anywhere near double the cost of similar products (or combinations thereof).

apple,From on the phone to Apple Care to leaving the Genius Bar with a fixed MacBook in less than 4 hours and at no cost (no Apple Care or warranty)! This is why I love Apple's support,"So yesterday evening I decided to remove the logic board from my early 2011 15"" MBP to clean out the dust that had been collecting under it. I've done various repairs on this machine previously so I wasn't too worried.

Unfortunately after I'd put it all back together again the built in display didn't work anymore. Everything else was fine and no problem using an external display worked fine. I ruled out the reed switch by checking the clamshell status from the terminal. Tried reconnecting the display cable several times and even took out the whole logic board again in case I'd missed something. Still nothing... I was convinced I'd be in for a very expensive repair or have to buy a whole new machine. There was no warranty on the machine and I never took out Apple Care for it (hence why I was servicing it myself in the first place).

So I called Apple support today and after the usual PRAM and SMC reset they were able to offer me an appointment in just a few hours. So I booked the apointment and went into town and got a quote from an authorised service partner for the repair while I waited (which would have been several hundred Euros more expensive than at the Apple Store). When I got to the Apple Store I had to wait less than 10 minutes to be seen. The Genius was really helpful and friendly and didn't give me any shit for attempting the repair myself. She took the machine to the back to take a look and after waiting just a few minutes with little hope she returns and powers up the machine. And the screen comes on! Apparently the connector wasn't seated correctly (whoops) despite reconnecting it several times and it looking fine. She must've had a magic touch or something.

Anyway, I'm *really* attached to my Mac. Not just because it was expensive, but because to me it's my diary, my toy, my connection to friends far away and the internet and much more. I was so relieved. I thanked her what felt like a million times and asked her if there was somewhere I could leave her a positive review before leaving. I never paid a cent (the authorized service partner would've charged 66€ just to look inside the machine) despite the fact that it was my own fault it was broken and it wasn't covered by any kind of warranty.

I realise this was a very basic fix and it didn't cost Apple anything but a few minutes of the Genius' time. But if it had been any other computer there's no way I would've had a working machine again so fast or for free. Even if it had needed a new logic board or screen, I would've had it back in 3-5 working days. As someone who uses their Mac for hours every day for work and leisure, this is worth a lot to me. In this day and age having to go without a computer for an extended period is just not acceptable to many people including myself. To me this alone is worth the ""Apple tax"".

So to the Genius who fixed my beloved Mac today: Thank you sooooo much. You made for one *very* happy customer today (I think you could probbaly tell)! I haven't received an email from Apple asking me to leave feedback yet, but when I do you can bet it's going to be a 10/10 and if I don't get an email I will personally call your manager and let him know how awesome you were!",65,148,2014-07-19,AAPL,0.05214351415634155,0.9103626608848572,0.0374937579035759

apple,(PSA) To those installing Yosemite Beta: Be sure to disable TRIM for any 3rd party SSDs before installing or you will not be able to boot. (Details inside),"If you have already installed Yosemite and are unable to boot, follow these steps (From http://www.cindori.org/trim-in-os-x-yosemite/)

    Boot your Mac in Recovery Mode by holding Cmd-R during boot
    
    Open the Terminal from the menu bar
    
    Run these commands, replacing YourDisk with the name of your Mac disk
    
*     rm -rf /Volumes/YourDisk/System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext
*     cp -r /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext /Volumes/YourDisk/System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext
*     touch /Volumes/YourDisk/System/Library/Extensions
* kextcache -u /Volumes/YourDisk
        
Wait until it finishes (can take up to 1 min)

To enable TRIM after installing Yosemite see this site: http://www.cindori.org/enabling-trim-on-os-x-yosemite/

EDIT 1: Fixed link

EDIT 2: To be clear, if you installed a 3rd party SSD, TRIM will only be enabled if you manually enabled it using TRIM enabler or similar. If you haven't done this then TRIM will not be enabled on your SSD (but you really should enable it).",80,162,2014-07-24,AAPL,0.09011680632829666,0.8819898366928101,0.027893342077732086

apple,Have an AirPort router? Have an external USB HDD? Here's how to make a super-simple NAS (Network-Attached-Storage) volume you can access straight from your iOS devices!,"**This only works with AirPort Extreme routers, the AirPort Express is not supported. Thanks to /u/sunsurfin and /u/alcal for the correction.**


1. Connect your USB Hard drive (make sure it is formatted and ready to go) to your AirPort router's USB port

2. Download [FileBrowser](http://www.stratospherix.com/products/filebrowser/) on your iOS device

3. Follow [these steps](http://www.stratospherix.com/support/gsw_timecapsule.php) to configure FileBrowser to see your AirPort.  The instructions say 'Time Capsule' but this works just as well for a regular AirPort with an attached hard drive.  

4. That's it!  You can now load any type of file an iOS device can use onto that hard drive, and access it from your iOS devices right over the network without going through a computer.  

If you only have laptops (like me) and do not have an 'always-on' computer in your home, you will really love this setup.  Here is a way that I have used this setup myself:

Say you would like to download a bunch of long-form videos that you'd like to watch on your home theater, but you don't want to have to have your computer on in order to do this (like Apple's WWDC session videos).  

1. Configure your computer's download utility to download the files from the internet straight onto the AirPort-connected HDD (by specifying the download path to a directory there).  

2. Download your videos (make sure they are h264 format videos that an iOS device can play directly, mkvs will not work) so that they are now on the AirPort's HDD. Once the download is complete you will no longer need your computer at all!

3. Use FileBrowser to open the directory with the videos, and start playing one.  

4. AirPlay the video to your Apple TV

Boom!  You're in business.  FileBrowser allows you to lock your iOS device and the video will keep playing on your TV, you can even leave the app and do something else.  

This setup was a huge improvement on my old version, which involved me keeping my laptop running all the time so I could access videos directly off of it's drive.  Now the laptop can be completely shut off, and I can still access and watch any of my videos straight off my router.  

Also, **if you have a static IP from your ISP, you can also connect to this remotely from anywhere in the world using FileBrowser**!  You have to add it as a separate connection (as it's a different connection setup), but it's pretty straightforward.  This basically gives you all the functionality of a product like [FileTransporter](http://www.filetransporter.com) just with the router you already own and any external USB HDD!

I hope this is helpful.  I have helped many of my friends with this setup and they all think it is so cool and had no idea they could access a networked file system directly with iOS this way.  With an AirPort and an Apple TV you can basically get all the functionality of fancy home theater PCs, without the PC!",29,145,2014-07-24,AAPL,0.033903252333402634,0.9379124045372009,0.028184274211525917

iphone,Received an email from AT&amp;T accusing me of using the mobile hotspot feature on my 5s.,"Not sure if this is the right sub but here goes.

Back story: A few months ago I received a text from AT&amp;T asking me if I knew I needed a data plan to use my phone as a mobile hotspot. I disregarded this message as an advertisement to get me to move off my unlimited plan.

Today I received an email from AT&amp;T threatening to automatically upgrade my plan to a 10gb/month plan if continued to use my phone has a hotspot. I have never used my previous 2 iphones as a hotspot or ""tethered"" it to another device for internet access. I felt a bit offended that I was being accused of something I had not done so I called to inquire what was going on. I asked for specific dates or things that were accessed from my device which they would not provide. At that point I asked for a manager because again, I wasn't going to be accused of something I didn't do and wanted to know the evidence. 

So when I transferred to manager I again asked for evidence of what I was being accused of. Again he declined and explained to me that they can't reveal that information because that allows customers who are caught tethering to figure out what they can and can't detect. He did reveal to me that it was something that had been going on since and that information is a secret. He did reveal to me that it started at the end of January, which oddly enough is when I upgraded my old iphone4 to a 5c and when he noticed that detail he backed off a bit and said ""Well lets put that idea on the back burner while I explain some things"". He went through the whole jailbreak/pdanet/mywi, etc. I didn't care, I didn't need to hear it. I know all about it. I used to jailbreak years ago and tether back in the old edge and early 3g days. Then my electric company started offering internet service and it gives me wifi for nearly our entire county so I've never bothered jailbreaking since before my iphone 4. I even had him go back and look at my average usage and tell me that it was under 2gb/month over the last 6months  which again, if I was tethering wouldn't it be A LOT higher?

I don't have a jailbroken phone. When I go into my settings to enable personal hotspot it pops up the message that says ""to enable personal hotspot on this account contact AT&amp;T...blah..blah"" so from my end it doesn't even look like I can until AT&amp;T sets it up on their end for my account. 

The only conclusion the manager came up with was that it was my car's navigation doing it so when I link my phone to my car to enable hands-free and mp3 playback it likely is using my phones internet connection and thus it is considered tethering and against the policy. So he recommended that I no longer use my phone as a music player in my car unless it uses the 3.5mm headphone/aux jack. 

I'm still extremely angry about how I was treated and accused of doing something I am 100% positive I wasn't doing. Any ideas or links to more info on how to fight this? I really don't like the idea of not being able to use hands free in my car.

apple,Congratulations FOX NOW for ruining the Apple TV Experience. You are now Hidden!,"I use Apple TV when I'm on the treadmill just to keep my mind off the fact that I'm just like a hamster in a wheel.

Anyway, the new FOX NOW addition is horribly broken.  Not only do they force you to watch commercials (which I understand, but don't like), but they executed it so poorly, I'm just going to ignore them.

I watched 3 Family Guy episodes, and was 'forced' to watch the new ""Gotham"" commercial 6 times in a row.  Not at various points in the Family Guy viewing... but at the 2nd commercial break... 6 times, one after another.  

It is repeatable and happened for all three Family Guy episodes.

So, yes, FOX, you got me to watch 18 identical commercials for your new series.  While I suspect you meant me to watch this new show... all your pathetic attempt has done has made it 100% certain that I will not, and that I will not be watching any of your streaming content at all.  I'll just find it elsewhere.

apple,My Apple Experience (x-post from /r/mac),"I want to take a moment and give a huge shoutout to the Apple Customer Service team (especially Steve) for my fantastic experience today.


I bought my very first Mac, a 13"" rMBP with 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd (late 2013) around a month ago through Bestbuy. I knew an update was imminent and it'd be minor, but I needed the computer and Bestbuy had them for $75 off retail and I was able to use the $150 off educational coupon. At $1,275+tax, I was very happy with my purchase. After I got home, I bought the extended Applecare warranty (which Apple price matched my university, another shoutout).


For the past 2-3 weeks, I was extremely happy with the computer and it was doing everything I wanted it to do. However, the moment I knew would come came yesterday, when Apple announced the updated rMBP line-up. This resulted in Bestbuy dropping their old models (late 2013) by $100. Instead of a 30-day return policy, Bestbuy has a 15-day, and my computer was just outside of it. Now bear in mind, I have no intention of returning my rMBP for the updated model because the update was minor and I already chose the 8 gb ram version, but inside Bestbuy's return policy is a subsection about price adjustment: if they reduce their price within 15 days, you can call back for a price adjustment. As I said before, I fell just outside the 15-day window. But I thought I'd give it a shot by calling Bestbuy's customer service... no dice, as I expected. Then I remembered the many shoutouts /r/mac has given Apple's customer service over the years and with nothing to lose, I gave them a call.


I explained my situation to the first rep (forgot his name) and as I expected, there's nothing he could do, but he offered to transfer me to his supervisor, Steve. Steve explained to me that unfortunately Apple cannot issue price adjustments for 3rd party sellers, which I knew. But before I disconnected the call, Steve offered to call Bestbuy himself, knowing that I fell just outside of the 15-day policy, to see whether they can work something out, and said he'd call me back.


At this point, I've moved on and I went back to my usual routine. I got a call back from Steve about 15 mins afterwards and to my surprise, he convinced the manager to do the price adjustment. I was so shocked that before I could properly thank him, the call ended. I called the Bestbuy store and confirmed with the manager soon after, got there after work and walked out with $100 cash from the price adjustment :)


Proof: I'll post the receipt when I get home

apple,Apple Store in Boston evacuated.,"The Apple Store on Boylston Street in Boston, MA was evacuated earlier today after reports of a suspicious and unattended bag either inside or right in front of the store.

I was on the first floor, checking out a Macbook pro, when an employee kindly asked me if I could move to the second floor, third floor, or leave, as they were ""cleaning"" the first floor. I thought that was rather odd, why would they be cleaning the first floor at a rather busy time (6 P.M.) on Boylston Street?

So anyway, I went up to the third floor, spent some time, and decided to leave. As I walked down the spiral stairs, I noticed the bottom floor was nearly empty, except for 2 or 3 people that began sprinting out of the door with worried looks on their faces. I heard yelling near the entrance, so I thought maybe the people running out had stolen something, but then I saw a cop and he was yelling, ""Everyone out! Evacuate this area! That is an order!"" 

So I ran out of the store, crossed the street, where I began to ask people what happened. People told me there was a suspicious bag with ""something metal"" inside. As I stood across the street, there was a flood of blue shirts literally sprinting across Boylston Street, as the Apple Store employees were ordered to evacuate.
