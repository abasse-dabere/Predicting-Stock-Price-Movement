**HOW TO UNLOCK YOUR DEVICE IF YOU GOT HIT TOO!**

----


Ok, There are a lot of comments and everyone that comes here with a similiar problem will not have time to get through them - so I'm adding a small section of how to deal with it if you got hit too.

First of all - **if you didn't have 2FA**, keep in mind that the person that accessed your account **had also access to the keychain with all your other passwords and all the photos and docs in the iCloud drive**. 


Secondly - as far as I understood from the comments, **if he set up a passcode on your phone (because you never had one), then you'll have to wipe your device anyways.**

So, the resolution - I assume your account was automatically on lockdown by apple, if not just skip the steps with password reset:

----

1 Open up https://www.icloud.com/#find

2 Log in

3 (Most likely) You'll be prompted to reset your password, you can do that here:
https://iforgot.apple.com/password/verify/appleid

4 Enter your email, the code from the image, then you'll be asked to answer a few questions and enter your 
backup phone number
5 Enter new password after going through the above step

6 Log in again to https://www.icloud.com/#find

7 Find your device on the list

8 Turn off the Lost mode

---

Then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD AND NEVER REUSE PASSWORDS, Don't be a dumb ass like I was.

**tl;dr someone hacked into my two-factor protected account, put into lost mode, demanded 75$ or he'll wipe iCloud**

Yesterday when I was heading out to a party I noticed a strange message on my iPhone asking to send an email - and I suddenly realized that my phone was put into lost mode. 

http://imgur.com/a/IRSWO

I quickly jumped onto my inbox and found out that two devices were put into that state out of nowhere, and shortly after that Apple blocked my account (phew). To translate - Red arrows are the ""Device was put into lost mode / Device has been found"", Blue are ""Your account has been accessed from a web browser"", whilst the green one is ""Your apple ID password has been reset"". 

http://imgur.com/a/SFEcv

Yes, after I changed my password he was able to AGAIN change the lost mode status!

I mailed that account (obviously from a disposable email) to check what's going on, and I got an automatic response:

http://imgur.com/a/kXnqp

I don't hold anything in the iCloud thankfully (at least nothing important or shameful), so this doesn't really bothered me. But still, could anyone explain how the heck he was able to get around two factor auth?

Also, it seems no one paid yet, since the bitcoin wallet is empty

Moreover, I posted this on a polish social reddit-like page, and it turned out someone had similiar situation 3 hours later. Maybe someone else on this subreddit was also affected?",423,1454,2017-07-01,AAPL,0.17088714241981506,0.8032052516937256,0.025907672941684723
apple,MacOS Terminal - Alternative to antivirus,"With the recent hack thread here some people may feel more concerned about their security and privacy than usual. Before you go and install an antivirus, here are some terminal commands that I use to monitor my system for any suspicious behavior:

* use `lsof` to check software connecting to the internet. in terminal, type: `sudo lsof -Pn -i4`. This will display all IPv4 connections on the system numerically. Pay attention to the listings that include an arrow (-&gt;) as they show an outgoing connection (connection to the internet)

* `nettop` is also a utility to monitor network usage, which I personally use to measure how much data is moving through that connection. Nettop requires your terminal be maximized to see its full output. To see the speed of the connection press d. Press c to only show the program and link, and e to re-expand it.

* `top`. Top is something like a simpler activity monitor that runs in your terminal. I prefer it to activity monitor since it's less of a resource hog so you can get a clearer picture of what is eating up your CPU. To list it from highest CPU usage to lowest press o, then type cpu and press enter.

* Codesign. Codesign is a utility built into OSX and one of my favorite commands on the system. Codesign lets you check and verify the code signature on a program, that way you can see whose signature is on the code and if the signature is valid. This is an important tool to keep in mind with the rash of attacks on open source software. Check the signature on everything you install and if it doesn't look correct or if its changed, DON'T INSTALL and email the developers. Usage: `codesign -dvv /path/to/file` for the full signature information including developer info. `codesign -vv /path/to/file` to verify a file. Codesign works on .app files and some .dmg files too.

* `shasum` is a program to check the hash of a file. This is useful for things like ISOs and unsigned applications to verify their authenticity. To use, type `shasum -a &lt;type&gt; /path/to/file`. &lt;type&gt; should be the algorithm type such as 1 or 256. 1 is less secure than 256 but is more widely used.

* `pkgutil --check-signature` can be used to verify the signer of a .pkg without opening it.

* `pkgutil --expand /path/to/file.pkg /path/to/destination` to extract a .pkg into a folder. You can then analyze the contents of the .pkg. Some .pkgs will just contain the .app it means to install, and this way you can just drop the app into /Applications/ without having to enter in a password.


* **Scripts**

You can use the features of the Terminal's shell bash to get an even clearer picture. Here are some of my favorites:

* `ps axo %cpu,comm | sort` This is a quick and dirty way to get a listing of all processes sorted by their CPU usage %. Uses even less cpu than top

* Codesign scripts:

for i in \`ps axo pid\` ; do codesign -dvv $i 2&gt;&gt; codesign.log ; printf . ; done ; grep Authority codesign.log | sort -u

This uses codesign to check the signature of every program running on the system, then output the developer information. Repeats are omitted. 

for i in \`ps axo pid\` ; do codesign -v $i ; done

Verifies the signature of every software running on the system. If there is no output then all the software running is OK. It will probably give an error about ""No such process"" and ""PID: No such file or directory"" since I'm too lazy to work those kinks out. If it gives other errors, run the number in ps (""ps &lt;number&gt;"") to see what the problematic software is and go from there.

**Additional steps**

* `spctl --status` will check the status of your Mac's first line of defense, the gatekeeper. Having it disabled is very bad security and there are other workarounds to running software that may be blocked by it rather than completely disabling it.

* Check software running at startup. There are several folders that you can check. /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons /Library/StartupItems are 3 to check. The best way to check them is with `ls -la` in the terminal. ls to list the files in a folder, -l will do a 'long' listing with more detailed information and -a will show all files including hidden ones. Important if an attacker added a startup item but made it hidden from Finder.",86,1311,2017-07-01,AAPL,0.06338166818022728,0.9048216342926025,0.031796688213944435

apple,Insane Apple Store Experience,"Hi Everyone,

Preface: An insanely POSITIVE experience on friday.

I purchased a 2016 15"" tbMBP on March 1 of this year. That's roughly 4 months from this past Friday where this took place. For some reason, one of the ports on my laptop blew (straight up was fried, no water damage, seemed to be not my fault :P).

Took it to the Apple store this past Friday and saw a Genius techie. He told me that while my device was under warranty, they'd unfortunately need to replace the whole logic board (a 3-5 business day endeavor). At this point I was pretty satisfied, didn't have to pay a dime, minor inconvenience, no biggie. However, after seeing so many stories on reddit about Apple's generosity I decided to casually ask: ""Any way I can get a loaner or a replacement machine?"" Now note, I was really kind and open about this, didn't press at all. Unfortunately, the techie said he didn't have that kind of authority, and since it's past the 14 day return window (4 months!!!) there was probably nothing they could do. However, he told me he'd ask a sales rep/manager just to see. 

Next, the sales rep lady came over, I told her the same story (very gently) and told her how important this laptop was for me. She told me she felt sorry, but like the Genius said, it's past the 14 day window so nothing they could do. She also added that she didn't have the power to do something like that anyways. As with the genius, I said okay nbd, thanks so much for trying and left it at that. However, she decided that this was worth the managers attention, and after 30 mins she was able to get a hold of him.
He comes over, same story by me, same reaction by him. 14 day return window, blah blah. I told him no worries, just wanted to ask since I've heard people getting upgraded for free. He told me yeah that mainly happens for 2012 MBP's w/ faulty batteries. At this point I was totally okay, I was able to talk to the manager, I tried, no biggie. He walks away.

10 seconds later he comes back and tells the sales rep, ""You know what, let's take care of him. She'll handle the transaction"" and walks away. At this point I'm like what, no way, but alas, I get a FULL refund on my nearly maxed 15"" tbMBP, and I have 2 gift-cards of said value waiting to be spent on a 2017 model :).

Has anyone else had this happen to them? I feel like most posts are with respect to the 2012 replacement battery, but this was a 4 month old machine!! Crazy experience, thanks apple!",296,1006,2017-07-04,AAPL,0.05029730871319771,0.9016801118850708,0.04802251607179642

apple,To those who feel facial recognition couldn't possibly replace Touch ID.,"One thing we don't know exactly is *how* effective the rumoured facial recognition technology could be.

Imagine (and this is by no means an informed prediction, just a thought experiment) that the new iPhone can:

1. Identify your face from an angle of 45º - which means it can identify your face, even if you're looking straight at it and tilting the phone away at an angle of 45º.

2. Can tell whether you're looking at it or not - by tracking your eyes so that it can tell if you're looking away, even while you're facing it.

Let this sink in, because this would be **huge** – 

You might be on Reddit at a desk right now and your phone might be sitting nearby, imagine that just by glancing at it, it wakes and shows the lockscreen. Now imagine that as soon as you pick it up or tap on it, accelerometers trigger and the phone unlocks itself. 

Maybe you're holding your phone right now, after reading this try putting it in your pocket and pulling it back out. Imagine that as soon as you turn the phone to face you, it automatically wakes and you need only Force Touch *anywhere* on the screen and it unlocks.

For this to happen you need a camera that can

- Recognise your face from a wide 45º angle using a convex lens.
- Recognise your face in darkness using some sort of infrared sensing.
- Recognise your face with enough fidelity, to tell it's actually you and whether your eyes are looking at it or not.

Not easy things to overcome, but not something out of science fiction either.

Do I personally believe this is possible on the next iPhone? No - only the staunchest optimist would think this kind of technology is ready for mass production - we're not quite there yet. But the prospect of having devices that can unlock and turn on just by looking at them is extremely exciting and opens up a world of possibilities.",327,208,2017-07-04,AAPL,0.026217442005872726,0.9332602620124817,0.040522314608097076

apple,Reality Check on Face Recognition,"Face recognition is extremely unlikely on the next iPhone. I know everyone is excited, but....

* The rumor source is an analyst, KGI. In my years of following Apple rumors, analysts are rarely right on anything major like this. Sometimes they hedge like ""an apple watch is coming with heart rate sensor, one day"" other times its an outlandish claim, or just common sense. Face sensing is not going to be on the iPhone. Some rumors are believable, others are not.

* Apple has spent years getting the public and banks to trust Touch ID and get it to the speed/state it is today. To switch to face ID completely, with their flagship phone model, no backup touch ID, and split their lines with a second form of biometrics would be risking the experience of their best customers. 

* Apple seems pretty focused on AR, and it seems their best tech is in the rear camera. I doubt it will make it to the front camera. There is no indication that the rear camera has the 3D sensing abilities required to scan a face in detail.

* Apples most advanced camera, the rear camera, can finally do AR with 3D sensing cameras that can find planes. To expect the lower quality, smaller, space contstrained front camera to have multiple IR sensors, lasers, and the ability to see faces from 180 degrees/angles is unrealistic. It makes more sense to have this on the rear camera as well if they are adding this ability. It would make AR kit and tagging people/photos more accurate.

* Apple has patents to make the front of a display a camera, or having imaging performed through a display. This means a larger, more accurate, thinner, touch ID area, since it doesn't have to fit in a button and can have a bigger sensing area.  There has also been talk of ultrasonic sensing. I think this is more likely than making a 3D scanning multi IR sensor front camera that fits near the speaker (or behind the whole display). In addition, a through display camera is going to be more accurate when the image is pressed against it, as opposed to when it is capturing a whole environment.

* To unlock using touch, you have to physically choose to open the phone. This is more secure than automatically being unlocked when you are within view of the camera. People could buy stuff or unlock phones just by holding it up to your face...an image is a lot different than a fingerprint in terms of legality and ease of acquiring (for police and public). It also means the camera turns on every time you open the phone, which is a security issue that touch doesn't have. 

*  Some people say there may be touch ID on the side button. I can't imagine Apple adding touch ID and keeping accuracy with a small bar as opposed to a round, full button, but hey, its possible.

*  It makes far more sense to add face sensing to the laptop and desktop line, where there is always a camera with room for more sensors aimed directly at your face, the image won't be moving or have all sorts of lighting conditions, and 3D scanning could could be used for modeling and sending 3D objects to your iPhone/AR kit. Users could also continue to use Touch ID for authentication until the face scanning tech was small and good enough to put in your phone. Some may ask why didn't touch ID start on laptops ? It was far more needed on phones then and Apple wanted people to do mobile purchasing.

Some Apple decisions are believable. Ditching Magsafe (they had been changing it updating it already, and it was limiting thinness), switching to USB-C (they love simplifying ports, and a universal port has been their goal for a while), and contactless or inductive charging (simpler, less ports) all have reasons. I was pretty sure they were going to do touch ID on their laptops for years, and was wondering why it took so long (imagine shopping on your laptop with touch ID and never entering a CC number again). But to switch to face recognition on iOS makes no sense at at all.

apple,"BEWARE: Snapnator ""USB-C MagSafe adapter"" is Garbage","I was hopeful to support a startup company with a very desirable product. Unfortunately the following occurred when I ordered the product...

* Lead time on the product seems to be 2-3 weeks minimum. I didn't realize this at first, and it is my fault, but pretty crazy IMO. It's not made clear it's drop shipping from china to the US which obviously plays into this.

* The email response for order status was painfully slow.

* The tracking info didn't show up in the tracking system for days after I was given it.

* **Horrible quality** When the product arrived, the packaging and everything about the product itself was extremely sub-par. Cracked, uneven, rough, chipped, scratched, oddly textured materials were all that I could see all over both sides of the adapter. There was glue visibly oozing out of certain areas. Absurdly bad.

* The product did not match what was pictured on their website.

* When I installed the USB-C ""Magsafe"" side into the Mac (against my better judgement I wanted to at least test-fit it because I didn't think it'd fit, it didn't.) it failed to sit even close to flush with the housing of the MacBook Pro.

* When I brought these issues to the attention of the company, in addition to the fact that I could have ordered something from Amazon for the same price and had a guaranteed quality product, and then demanded a refund, all that I received in reply to the photos and facts I outlined was ""we never sell it on Amazon"".

That's it. Nothing apologizing, or addressing the quality issues. Just an improperly capitalized/punctuated 6 word reply without so much as a salutation or goodbye. 

Buyer beware, this company is a scam and doesn't give a shit about delivering a quality product. I disputed via PayPal and my money was refunded.

ipad,"Comparing Notability, Goodnotes, OneNote, Nebo, Noteshelf and Note plus. (perspective of a college student)","Update 1 (16 July 2017) : Added some of the alternatives mentionned in comments.

#A bit of background:

I have had an iPad since the first one ever came out. For a long time, I wanted the iPad to replace my pen and paper (my preferred way of processing information) and it’s only been since the iPad Pro came out that I could see myself rely more on the iPad. I spent a lot of hours testing different note taking apps on the iPad, always eager to find **the one**. Unfortunately for me, I haven’t found one that had everything I wanted for a paperless experience yet, but a few have come close. As you'll notice in my write-up, I have a workflow that involves GoodNotes, Notability and OneNote. Not ideal, but it works for me.

The research, writing and organization of this text post have been done exclusively on my 1st generation 9.7 iPad Pro, but formatting this for Reddit required a computer.

**Analog to paperless comparison**

	GoodNotes: a file cabinet containing your notebooks
	Noteshelf: a bookcase with your notebooks (can't organize further)
	Noteplus: a bookcase with your notebooks (can't organize further)
	OneNote: a big (infinite) whiteboard, pinboard.
	Notability: a binder with dividers, adding more “loose sheets”, most similar to Livescribe (voice recording linked to ink)
	Nebo: your assistant typing your handwritten notes into Word

**Note plus**

[Some Pros and Cons](http://imgur.com/I6LyNpA)

I mostly used Note+ before I owned the iPad Pro. Its palm rejection was the most powerful in my opinion. Note plus developer took too long to support the Apple Pen and while its ink engine was probably the best, it now feels laggy and limited. I have long since moved onto other apps. Note plus stays very relevant for those who own regular iPads and are using non bluetooth enabled styluses.

**Notability**

[Some Pros and Cons](http://imgur.com/N5esboS)

Its voice recording linked to ink is the deal maker here. If you think you are going to need it, I feel that this single feature is worth all its shortcomings. It’s, to my knowledge, the only app to offer this on the iPad. Notability is very powerful indeed, with a strong organization scheme. As I don’t really use voice recording, Notability is my app of choice when doing my math/phys/chem etc homeworks. Its infinite scrolling feature works very well for this. I use Notability as I would loose sheets.

**^Edit**^: ^Moving ^pictures/pdf ^after ^the ^fact ^can ^be ^done ^by ^pressing ^on ^T, ^then ^tapping ^on ^the ^image. ^Thanks ^/u/rkraupa ^!

**GoodNotes**

[Some Pros and Cons](http://imgur.com/Js7ZlFl)

The other powerhouse for note taking. This is my main app for taking notes at school. I like that my handwriting is searchable (“What does eigenvalue mean again??”) and it’s very easy to add titled bookmarks. That way, I can go into bookmark mode and have a complete outline of all my notes - very useful when reviewing or studying for an exam. You can also have multiple notebooks loaded, navigating between them by tabs. On a 9.7 iPad Pro, I leave it on landscape mode to simulate the width of regular paper and having to manually change page feels too clunky for doing homework for my taste.

**Nebo**

[Some Pros and Cons](http://imgur.com/FBeiyB1)

One of the new kids on the block. The MyScript team has outdone themselves. This app allows you to write everything with your Apple Pen and then convert into a fully formatted typed document. Their gesture-based editing engine is powerful and makes the lack of additional buttons on the Apple Pen (and eraser) almost a non-issue. Must try to see a note app done right. I haven’t found any use for it in my current workflow, but I can see a lot of people using it for things that need to be transcribed later. My main gripe with Nebo is that you can’t title any of your notes. 

**Noteshelf**

[Some Pros and Cons](http://imgur.com/kIkKVJ0)

The alternative to GoodNotes, IMO. 
It has a ton of templates. The ink engine is better than average. If I wasn’t already so comfortable with using GoodNotes, it would be a strong alternative for me. It could also replace Notability, but since Noteshelf is also a Notebook based note taking app, I’ve decided to compare apples to apples. It also allows for adding stickers which I think can be useful to highlight important sections of your notes. No smart shapes though.

**OneNote**

[Some Pros and Cons](http://imgur.com/h10gkhp)

While not as good as its PC version, OneNote still has a strong place in my workflow. Its infinite canvas allows me to process a lot of information without feeling constrained by page size. It’s my favourite way to build cheat sheets for studying, keep useful information that I find on the web or just to organize my thoughts. In fact, I am currently writing this with OneNote open in split view. However, there are a lot of QoL features either missing or really unintuitive, such as restyling ink after the fact. Ever since Evernote switched its free service to the 2 device limit, I switched to OneNote for those web clips, notes/research gathering, information to remember (build orders for Offworld Trading Company, belt balancing designs for Factorio, locations of korok seeds for Zelda: BotW...). OneNote is the app I use when I want to clip out important theories or examples from my textbooks.

#A few comments:

- The Undo button on the right is annoying for someone who is right-handed. While you are writing with your right hand, your left hand is free. Please put the undo button on the left (or better yet, user toggling for left/right) so that your other hand can easily reach popular buttons. However, in the occasions where you can only use one hand, the undo button on the right is sweet. YMMV.
- Color is your friend when taking organized handwritten notes. If it takes more than 3 taps to change colors, it becomes very tedious.
- While I understand the design behind single page note taking, it feels like trying to force the paper way onto a paperless device. Infinite scrolling when editing, and single page scrolling for reviewing would be the sweet spot IMO.

apple,"Isn't the ""rumored"" dark mode in iOS 11 supposed to save battery life on OLED display ONLY if the blacks are true blacks #000000? As a UI designer, I never ever use true blacks or true whites for backgrounds as they are extremely harsh on eyes. Then they won't really save battery life?","**EDIT:** I am editing this post text as I am unable to edit the actual title. **I was wrong in my original conception that only true blacks save battery on OLED.**

**About the power consumption debate**

I had the misconception that OLED displays save power only when the pixel is pure black. I assumed it to be binary - ""either pixel is emitting light or it isn't"". This falacy also seems to supported by online sources which aren't too reliable as pointed out in the comments. Not everything on the internet is true.

After reading the discussion here and inputs from more reliable sources, it appears I was wrong.

I am going to paste a few extracts from the discussion in the comments:

Quoting /u/ikjadoon

From anandtech:
http://www.anandtech.com/show/9394/analysing-amoled-power-efficiency

And this chart:
http://images.anandtech.com/doci/9394/luminance-curve_575px.png

High brightness is where black vs white matters on AMOLED. If you go from white to dark gray, you save 780mW. If you go white to black, you save 880mW.
You can get 89% of the power savings with just dark gray.

Quoting /u/Xanthyria
But one thing to remember, pure whites in OLED actually have higher power usage than LCDs. A bright video or bright screen will cost more on OLED. A dark video or dark mode will cost less. At some point, I'm guessing it'll just balance itself out for the most part.

**About whether pure white text on pure black background is harsh on eyes**

NOTE that we are talking about ""PURE"" whites and blacks. Not grays or dark grays.

Pure White text on Pure black background is actually harsh on eyes for many people: ""People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white. Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the ""deformed"" lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.
Jason Harrison – Post Doctoral Fellow, Imager Lab Manager – Sensory Perception and Interaction Research Group, University of British Columbia""

**Design reasons for not using pure black and pure whites**

It has to do with many reasons caused due to the contrast difference between the background color and the content color. Note that these are also affected by factors such as room ambient lighting, screen brightness etc.

1. Black overpowers everything. Usually the focus of an app is the content. However if you make the entire background pure black, the focus is sort of lost.
2. If you use true #FFFFFF on true #000000, it's more straining your eyes.
3. Too much black can be overwhelming and evoke feelings of emptiness, gloom and sadness.

""However, most studies have shown that dark characters on a light background are superior to light characters on a dark background (when the refresh rate is fairly high). For example, Bauer and Cavonius (1980) found that participants were 26% more accurate in reading text when they read it with dark characters on a light background.""

These are worth reading:
https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes
https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/
https://uxplanet.org/design-principle-black-and-white-c8b4a43e65fe

You can mitigate the straining effects of white (#FFF) on black (#000) by simply lessening the contrast like using a light gray (#EEE, #DDD, #CCC) on a dark background (#111, #222). This still gives considerable battery gains.

All this aside, I can actually give you stats from my own app. I had a workout app which was using pure black and white text which had less user retention than after I changed it to a light gray on dark background. My users had also complained that the initial theme was too ""gloomy &amp; depressing"".

apple,Want to support a smaller app? Review it every time it updates.,"As a developer for a smaller app, one of the most frustrating aspects of the App Store process is the reviews. The App Store, by default, shows you the ratings and reviews for the most recent version of a given app. Yes, you can click ""all versions"" to see older reviews, but most people don't. 

For apps with millions of users, this is no problem - they get plenty of reviews for each version. But for a smaller app? The App Store doesn't even show a star rating for apps that have fewer than five reviews on the most recent version. This means that if I have 5+ good reviews, I am demotivated from updating my app (fixing bugs, adding cool features) because it will ""wipe"" my good rating until people rate the newest version. 

Apple is aware of this problem, and [will be fixing it around September](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/ios-app-developers-will-be-able-to-keep-app-store-ratings-when-releasing-an-update/).

apple,A Refreshed iOS Weather App,"***Disclaimer: This post is meant to be an open discussion about Apple’s current Weather app and features we’d all like to see in it, though I’ve provided and detailed my own personal ideas mainly to kick-off the discussion. This was not meant to be a self-promotion nor was it intended to be made into a third-party application (although it may happen). Thanks for all the kind words on my personal ideas and thanks for the discussion!***

Hello r/apple,
I’m the one who made a concept a while back for a refreshed Weather App. The concept wasn’t well-thought, so I took another shot at it.

In this second draft, it focuses on customization and follows the iOS 10/11 design language. Bold headers—I know—but it’s better than fragmented design. It also uses tabs which hasn’t been used in the Weather app before and can be potentially useful.

*The link shows two variations of the concept side-by-side, as well as two full-sized images (fit for iPhone 7 screen) so you can download and view them full-screen.*

https://imgur.com/a/qdkbq

**Glance**

First of all, you can customize your layout depending on how you use the app. A lot of users said they didn’t like what Apple offered at a single glance, so I’ve made a tab called “Glance” that allows you to rearrange the order in which your Weather information is displayed. Each section of information is split up and the indicator for the different sections is the bold headers and “≡” icon. If you tap and hold the “≡” icon, you can drag the entire section around and place it in between other sections as you wish.
This not only allows more customization, but it targets and almost solves the issue of users not being able to see the information relevant to them. This is the “Glance” tab’s biggest feature.

Here’s a couple images to show how the rearranging would work.

https://imgur.com/a/CCc0T

Another handy feature is the 3D Touch integration. 3D Touch will allow you to see *much* more information. 3D Touch on the “Today” widget to see all of the possible Weather information for today. 3D Touch on a day in “10 Day Forecast” get derailed information on that day’s Weather.

A smaller but nice feature is that if there’s images of your location provided for certain types of weather, the background will be your city or location matching your current weather conditions. As you can see, rainy New York weather shows a rainy New York in the background. If there is no images of your city *yet*, you will get the regular stock Weather app’s backgrounds.
(Aside if that, a smaller feature that is already in the Weather app but may be hard to notice is the option to add multiple locations and swipe between them. If you look at the top left corner, the dots are relocated up there to better fit with iOS 10/11 and due to there being a new tabs bar at the bottom.)

Here is an updated design of the Glance tab
https://i.imgur.com/FeDGFbG.png

**Radar**

Many users have complained that Apple doesn’t offer a radar for their native Weather app, and this concept also targets that. Along with the new tabs bar along the bottom, you get a tab called “Radar”.
Radar is exactly what it sounds like, a weather radar built right into the native app.
Now why does it have its own tab you ask? Because with its own tab, this allows for it to be very interactive. Pinch-to-zoom to see more or less area on the radar’s map, and tons of useful features alike.
Additionally, you can add a “widget” radar to your “Glance” tab. You can also drag that radar widget wherever you please.

Here is the updated design of the Radar tab
https://i.imgur.com/nqcRgQI.png

**News**

The News tab is also self-explanatory, it’s weather-based news. It pulls information from news sources pertaining to relevant Weather information such as climate change, extreme weather across the globe, etcetera.
This is not a necessity but it is definitely convenient and allows for world-wide weather exploration and keeps you up-to-date on all weather-related happenings.

Here is the updated design for the News tab
https://i.imgur.com/C2OJ78Z.png

**Alerts**

The Alerts tab is a very basic tab that stores all local weather-related alerts and also has a predictive feature that warns you of possible weather hazards based on the current weather information (e.g. 100% precipitation for the whole day = “Possible flood warning later today”; This helps to prepare you in advance rather wait until a flood is starting to issue a warning).

Here is the updated concept for the Alerts tab
https://i.imgur.com/fIpVA0m.png

I wrote this very quickly, so I may have poorly worded some segments.
Remember this is just a concept and can evolve for the better if enough discussion is made.
As always, ask questions, give criticism, and discuss! :)

Thank you.

apple,Spotify prompted me to rate the app. I obliged and it became a Spotify versus Apple Music comparison. I hope it's helpful for those trying to choose.,"Below is a copy-and-paste of my App Store review. For background, I have bounced back and forth between Spotify Premium and Apple Music since AM's inception. I currently have both with a student discount. I have an 8k track iTunes library carefully groomed and maintained over the past ten years. Anyway, here we go:



I will briefly compare Spotify and Apple Music, more as holistic services than just applications. 

Spotify is still the best at curation. It possesses some great features that Apple Music doesn't, such as the ability to make a radio station from a whole album or playlist, allowing for a more specific and accurate radio station. The 6 daily mixes are excellent, striking a pleasing balance between the familiar and exploration. Discover weekly is nuanced and intimate and I almost always love it. Spotify has a web player where Apple Music forces desktop users to use iTunes. Sorry Linux users. Spotify offers an additional notch for audio quality (and therefore more granular management of data and storage use) which allows the user to find a happy medium in data and quality, which is preferable to Apple's binary ""low"" and ""high"" quality settings (96 and 256 Kbps respectively). 

However, a few things still lack: One cannot sort an artist's albums chronologically. One cannot view an artist's albums from within the artist view. The inability to add more than 10,000 tracks to one's library is a bummer and an even greater offense is the inability to exceed 3,333 tracks stored locally across all devices. Apple Music features scan-and-match/upload so the user can bring his entire library with him in one app. 

So which is for you?

If you are interested in insightful, curated playlists and you listen to music in singles and radio stations, Spotify is for you. 

If you are a collector, if you wish to store a lot of music offline or you just have a lot of music in general, if you have a preexisting library on your computer you wish to seamlessly match/upload, if you listen more to albums than playlists or radio (AM has radio but it's not quite as nuanced), then you want Apple Music. 

As for me, my heart is torn. There are exclusive features of both that I value equally. I think that I will pay for Apple Music and use Spotify's free tier for daily mixes. But ask me in a week and I'm sure I'll have changed my mind.

Hope to have helped.",172,251,2017-07-18,AAPL,0.031857118010520935,0.927810549736023,0.04033233970403671

apple,LPT: Update your Mac with the softwareupdate command line tool for a much faster experience,"Updating macOS through the App Store can take a very long time — for me it's typically around 30 mins of rebooting and waiting.

macOS has a built in `softwareupdate` utility, which is much faster. It also allows you to use your Mac while it updates (the updates seem to be applied while it's powered on, and the reboot takes much less time than if it's triggered by an App Store update).

To use it, open Terminal and run one of the following commands:

`softwareupdate -l` to list available updates

`sudo softwareupdate -i &lt;name of update from the above command&gt;` to install one specific update

`sudo softwareupdate -i -a` to install all available updates

I usually do `softwareupdate -l` to check for updates and `softwareupdate -i -a` to install them.

To give a rough time estimate, it took around 10 mins to install the latest version of macOS 12.6 just now, and my MacBook Pro was only unusable for about 2 mins while it rebooted.",169,2022,2017-07-19,AAPL,0.042532142251729965,0.9275623559951782,0.029905490577220917

apple,/u/Foxconninsider's WWDC report card,"Based on excellent [summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6f21c7/everything_ufoxconninsider_reported_today/) by /u/Paige4o4
---

TL;DR -. More evidence needed. 

---


##Siri Speaker

- No recent information. Last design seen was similar to trash can Mac Pro, but smaller

 - Correct-ish: The HomePod looks kind of like a Mac Pro, but at the same time, he was by no means unique in saying this. With *actual* leakers saying [similar things](https://www.macobserver.com/news/rumor/apples-siri-speaker-might-look-like-miniature-mac-pro/) before him.
 
- Expected announcement at WWDC, but not shipping until end of 2017 due to delays

 - [December](http://i.imgur.com/Z8z4iuA.png)* and it's correct but again, [Bloomberg reported it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/apple-said-to-ready-siri-speaker-in-bid-to-rival-google-amazon) days before /u/Foxconninsider popped up.
- Will use a modified A9 SoC

 - [A8*
](http://i.imgur.com/dQw8TPq.png)

---


##iMac

- Incremental update in 2017. Full redesign in 2018

 - eh, even by Apple standards and ignoring the iMac Pro, the [latest update](https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/imac-update/) is a tad more than just incremental (incremental being a spec bump and nothing else). 


SIDENOTE: The person seemed to indicate that the new design was for an updated iMac, not necessarily a Pro model. But even if he is speaking about that, then he's got it wrong; iMac Pro is just regular iMac aluminium with different anodisation for Space Gray. Nothing similar about it compared to Thunderbolt Display. 

---

##MacBook Pro

- Bring back glowing apple logo

       - Nope.

- 32GB ram option for 15"" model. 
       - Uh, [nope](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/15-inch). And also, Intel Kaby Lake chips [do not support LPDDR4](http://www.loopinsight.com/2016/10/31/more-detail-on-the-reason-the-macbook-pro-is-limited-to-16gb/) which is what is needed for 32GB of RAM.


- No changes to the current 4X Thunderbolt ports
 - Accurate

---

##MacBook 12""

- Not much information. Updated SoC for 2017, but no major changes.
 - Accurate apart from the second generation butterfly switch keyboard (thanks /u/asoksevil)

---

* Preview can combine/edit/draw/rotate PDFs like a champ. Meanwhile I just spent 30 minutes on my Windows 10 machine trying to simply combine two PDFs and re-order the pages (it turns out you can't do this with either the W10 app OR Adobe without paying for adobe premium).

* Preview is highly customizable and lets me put whatever buttons I want at the top, in any order I want.

* Preview lets me open multiple files in the same window.

* Preview lets me easily add my signature to documents.

* Preview does a whole bunch of other great stuff I can't think of right now.

* Three cheers for Preview!",270,1236,2017-07-24,AAPL,0.02100871130824089,0.9261476993560791,0.05284357815980911

apple,Real-world performance of Night Shift in iPhone SE,"Edit: The main data is found here: http://i.imgur.com/oMv56vy.png

I work in an industry that allows me access to special scientific equipment. I often work with light sensitive materials, so I was curious as to how much benefit I would get out of always having my phone in Night Shift mode at work. 

To do this, I measured the true light output of my phone using a spectral radiometer. For these measurements, I used Safari. A page load was stopped so as to give me a pure blank white screen, the phone was place directly face down on the sensor, and the spectrum was captured for the light output of the screen both with and without Night Shift. In full disclosure, I do have a tempered glass screen cover, but it seems unlikely that this would have any major effect on the measurements. 

You can find a plot of the data here: http://i.imgur.com/oMv56vy.png As you can see, the RGB pixels of the phone peak at approximately 450 nm (blue), 540 nm (green), and 605 nm (red). Since Night Shift can't actually change the wavelength of light put out by a pixel, it works by dimming the individual outputs of red, green, and blue. In Night Shift with the warmest setting available, the red pixel output remains unchanged while the green output is reduced by nearly 60% and the blue output is reduced by nearly 90%. Your results will likely vary with phone, screen manufacturer, and Night Shift settings. Either way, I thought this was a fun little experiment to run in a short moment between projects. Let me know what you think.",20,440,2017-07-25,AAPL,0.0878920704126358,0.8545175194740295,0.05759039521217346

apple,Any idea why the corners in iOS11 are so weird? Designspecific question... sorry if this is wrong here.,"Hello, I'm new here and I just started designing for iOS devices recently. 

Now i just got the templates for the iOS11 beta from the official apple UI design resources page (for sketch). There I found that the round corners are not always round (like a quarter-circle). 

Before, I already tried to figure out the right radius for the corners from a screenshot. But I just could not do it with the Radius-option for the corners. It would just never really fit.

Now in the Templates for the ""UIElements+AppTemplates+Guides.sketch"" I found ""Views/Action Sheet/_Resources/Cancel Button"" – a cancel-button with a Radius of 14 for it's corners. Finally a reproducable value. So far, so good.

But now I checked a little more on other templates and in ""HIG-QuickAction-Menu"" I found that weird corner again. It looks almost like the ""Radius-14-corner"" but it just isn't. When I looked closer I found that it is actually made out of 12 single bezier-curves:

http://imgur.com/gallery/uxD6k

Is there a reason for these corners? Will they be gone after the beta? If not, how can I reproduce them? And why?

apple,The fact that the TouchBar isn't affected by Night Shift shows me that Apple doesn't actually understand their own feature,"As you probably noticed, the TouchBar isn't affected at all by Night Shift. To me, this isn't just a simple oversight. It means that most of the people who were overseeing the new MacBook (including all the execs) don't actually understand the Night Shift feature.

Night Shift isn't just something people use for fun to make their screen yellow. It's genuinely helps (some) people sleep better, by cutting down the blue light. It works for me, and it works for many other people. That's why a lot of us used [f.lux](http://justgetflux.com), long before Apple copied the feature.

Which is great. I'm glad Apple added Night Shift, so we can have a native iOS solution.

But not having Night Shift affect the TouchBar display (for two MacBook generations, now) isn't just a simple mistake.

It pretty much negates the very benefits I'm trying to get when I activate Night Shift.

What's the point of having Night Shift turned on, if there's still harsh white/bluish light coming from the TouchBar? (Yes, it's matte and it's not in your face, but it still matters.)

Not to mention, it creates a jarring contrast between the screen and the bar. When Night Shift is activated, one is yellow, the other is harsh white. On a purely aesthetic level (even not counting the benefits that Night Shift is supposed to provide) this is a mistake.

The whole point of getting an Apple device is that all the pieces are supposed to be working together. There's no excuse for having the TouchBar be exempt from Night Shift.

**TL;DR**

The TouchBar matches perfectly with the display when it's daylight (both are white).

It would make sense for it to match in the evening / night as well.",265,244,2017-07-29,AAPL,0.035307627171278,0.9176579713821411,0.047034408897161484

apple,How far are you willing to go to save your AirPods?,"This might as well be in the /TIFU subreddit but I figured it could also be a word of caution and durability report. 

While using the gentlemen’s restroom I stumbled upon a video and wanted to listen to it (deliding a CPU if you must know). While reaching for my AirPods and loading the first one into my ear, it slipped.... 

It fell straight down into the toilet I had already soiled. With a quick “sh@$!” I jumped around and plunged my hand into the sultry waste and retrieved the AirPod, beating the automated flush!

While wiping my hand off and looking at this soaked AirPod with dog treats all over it, I cleaned everything as best as I could, then cleaned it some more with some germicide I took off a janitors cart. The AirPod appears clean and like-new again and functions perfectly.

A fine built product by Apple indeed.

Be  extremely cautious when using those little buggers.",68,298,2017-07-30,AAPL,0.10019271075725555,0.8683680295944214,0.031439244747161865

iphone,"[Guide] Downloading videos from YouTube, Instagram, Facebook (and more) to your Camera Roll","Just recently, I learned that it's quite easy to download and save videos from sites like YouTube, Instagram, FB, &amp; Vimeo to your iOS device. All you need is a file downloading app and an online video downloader, such as [PickVideo](https://pickvideo.net).

In case you don't know how it works, here's a short guide:

* **Step 1:** First install a web browser from the App Store that has file downloading capability, such as [this one](https://itunes.apple.com/app/browser-and-file-manager-for-documents/id979401801?mt=8)

* **Step 2:** After it's installed, open the app and go to [pickvideo.net](https://pickvideo.net).

* **Step 3:** Choose the site from where you want to download videos (such as YouTube, Instagram, FB, etc.)

* **Step 4:** Paste the video's link and press the download button.

* **Step 5:** The site displays all the download links for that video. Tap and hold on any one of the download links and choose 'Download'.

* **Step 6:** Once the video is downloaded, go to the Files tab in the app, tap on the ellipsis icon (three dots) next to the video and choose 'Open In'.

* **Step 7:** Now choose 'Save Video' from the Sharing Sheet.

And that's it. The video should be saved to your iPhone's Camera Roll. Once you get the hang of it, it should be pretty easy and quick to download videos using this method.",33,258,2017-07-30,AAPL,0.02366904355585575,0.9378224611282349,0.03850850462913513
