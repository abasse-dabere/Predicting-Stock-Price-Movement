iphone,The iPhone 6 and the front pocket in your jeans. Is 5.5 inches too big?,"How big is too big to comfortably fit in the front pocket of a pair of jeans?  I know that may seem like a silly question, but I'm due for an upgrade and I'm planning on buying an iPhone 6.  I'm debating between the 4.7 and the 5.5 inch models, assuming that's what Apple releases.  I want the biggest size that comfortably fits in a front pocket of a pair of jeans.

Is there an Android phone with a similar size for the sake of comparison?

EDITED to add: I tend to be a Levis 501 guy, or I'll wear slim but never skinny jeans.  30x32.

EDITING THE EDIT to add:  I now own a 6 Plus and it fits in my front jeans pocket comfortably.  If the phone were any taller, it probably wouldn't fit, but as it is, it fits with enough room for a slim case.  Note that I sale a slim case.  That being said, if you're a girl who keeps her phone in her jeans rather than a purse, it may not fit.",91,64,2014-09-01,AAPL,0.02522503025829792,0.9241487383842468,0.050626229494810104

apple,iMessage holds clues to iWatch interface?,"It may be obvious, but we're 5 days out and I haven't seen anyone on here ponder the thought.

iOS8 audio messages in iMessages offer no real practical use on the phone. This feels like a feature that has been added to get ready for iWatch. Respond to a text by touching your watch and speaking. Audio message sent. 

Given this, one would expect the interface of iMessage audio recording to match closely on both devices. The whole 'swipe up to send' and 'swipe left to cancel' actions feel very... alien to iOS on the phone. We've never seen an equivalent. 

My guess is that this UI is a hint at how the iWatch will be used. And this UI element in iOS 8 is round - a quarter circle.  Another potential hint at the shape of the device.

([Objective-C](http://learn.iphonedev.tv/course/make-iphone-apps-in-Objective-c-for-ios7/?couponCode=COUPON337356Reddit&amp;src=reddit1) and [Swift](http://learn.iphonedev.tv/course/swift-primer/?couponCode=COUPON337355Reddit&amp;src=reddit1))

Apple is going to announce some awesome new products. If you learn to make code, you'll be able to sell your apps for cutting edge products.

I'm a former Apple employee and now I run a small development studio building iOS games and apps. It's been four years, and a crazy ride with ups and downs.

It was hard to make my first iPhone app and I want to make it easier for you to get started. I have been creating video tutorials for two years and I have helped a bunch of people publish and sell their first iPhone app.

**Pay it forward**

I have been selling these courses, but I wanted to give back to the community. Learn to make an iPhone app for free, and then help someone else in return.

Everyone has an idea for an app, and everyone should learn how to get started.

**Two free courses**

You can send and receive email with an alias, and people who receive email from the alias will see the alias address instead of your real iCloud address. You can also use aliases to help organize your iCloud email based on email address. You can create up to three aliases for use with your iCloud account. Aliases are not separate from your iCloud account, but are part of your iCloud account. An alias cannot be used as its own iCloud account.

**Edit 1:** Posted album 2.

**Edit 2:** Posted his screenshot of the metadata. Indicates ""iPhone 6"" name.

**Edit 3:** Posted five videos.

**Edit 4:** Uploaded to Youtube.

---------------

**Edit 5:** Some people here seem to think that this is a fake, ostensibly produced by a Chinese company. Here is some perspective:

The Goophone i5S is the highest-regarded iPhone knockoff in China (this is according to my former roommate, a Chinese technology journalist. If you know of a better one, please let me know). Goophone has been producing iPhone knockoffs for several years now. They generally resemble the latest iPhone at the time of their launch, and cost about 100 USD.

Here is a video review of the Goophone i5S, their knockoff of the iPhone 5s:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9whfXdQb9g

When you watch, pay attention to the:

* Physical build quality: materials, colors, exact dimensions, fine details around the ports, buttons, edges, camera, etc.
* Software visual design: typefaces, kerning, character weights, exact positioning of graphics, shadows/transparency effects, alignment, line thicknesses
* Software dynamics: FPS &amp;lt; 20, missing/different animations, high touch latency, fake rubberbanding, animation acceleration, Android-like camera delay, no parallax effects
* Software features: Android features in the settings, missing App Store, ummm... just watch the video.

Now examine the pictures, and rewatch the five videos that are posted, paying attention to the same details.

Do you really think that the same people that made the Goophone could have produced what we see in these videos? If the leak is fake, what could explain the huge jump in quality in just one year?

“You want to take the time to get it right. Our objective has never been to be first. It’s to be the best. To do things really well, it takes time. You can see a lot of products that have been brought to market where the thinking isn’t really deep and, as a consequence, these things don’t do very well. We don’t do very many things so we spend a lot of time on every detail and that part of Apple isn’t changing. It’s the way we’ve operated for years and it’s the way we still operate. I feel great about what we’ve got coming. Really great and it’s closer than it’s ever been.”

apple,"Wow, the hate on the watch is insane on this sub.","I get the feeling that a lot of you guys will never be happy with anything that's made any more since the expectations for products is now insane especially with the hype trains that run before any product launch. I remember when the 5 came out and people were pissed that it didn't have an infared keyboard that projected onto a flat surface. 

It's a little thick, cause its full of gear to do all the shit you wanted it to do. If it was thin and beautiful but missed some features you'd be pissed at that too. 

It's got the digital crown, because not only do you expect apple to do things a little differently but it actually makes sense to make small adjustments to menus and scrolling. 

It's square. Because you can fit more shit on a square screen and apps translate well onto it. 

Same for the iphone. ""The antenna bands are TOO BIG"". But when the 4 came out with its slim antenna bands the complaint was ""I lose signal when I hold it like this, why don't they fix this??"". 

Y'all need to step back and look at what they revealed. It's everything you wanted:

Larger iPhone with 1080p screen. 

An iphone with a screen over 5"" with better battery life

New digital wallet

Health app that is actually used

Imagine if those coupons were instead automatically added to Passbook, and automatically redeemed the next time I shopped.

apple,The two iPhone reviews you'll see on Friday.,"Sort of a pick your own adventure! I see it as The Verge vs. Engadget. Bold for one read, bold-italics for the other view. Clearly, there's not many unbiased reviews out there, though I consider The Verge to be less so than Engadget when it comes to Apple. The Apple hate amongst Engadget staff is palpable in nearly every post they make, moving from a light joke perhaps years ago to something that's totally lost it's humour and seeps through every writer's keyboard.

So, who's iPhone 6/6 Plus review will you be watching out for?

----

**Apple’s iPhone 6, 6 Plus, the most anticipated phone of 2014** / ***Apple’s iPhone 6, 6 Plus, do they live up to the hype?***

There’s no question that Apple’s latest iPhone is **[something totally new]** / ***[an iteration of a well-worn design]***. The iconic home button still sits below the **[Retina]** / ***[Retina-monikered]*** display, which has this time grown in size **[to a striking 4.7/5.5 inches]** / ***[to match what the rest of the smartphone world has grown accustomed to]***. This latest version also brings **[some new features]** / ***[mild spec bumps]*** to a **[proven]** / ***[tired]*** design. Despite some blunders during their live stream and preorder events, Apple’s latest phone has **[destroyed previous records for sales]** / ***[given fanboys something new to lust after]***. **[We put it through it’s paces to see just how much of an improvement it is over the 5S and compare it to the newest smartphones.]** / ***[We took it for a spin to answer the age-old question of all new Apple products: Does it live up to the hype?]***

First, we have to address the display. Finally, **[with the iPhone 6]** / ***[to catch up with Android competitors]*** Apple has boosted the size of the display to **[4.7 and 5.5 inches]** / ***[to match the Galaxy Note and Nexus 5 that came (well) before it].*** With this new display comes some new **[technology]** / ***[buzzwords]***. It’s called Retina HD and it bumps the resolution of the two new models to 1334×750 and 1920x1080, respectively. **[This is to keep the resolutions in line with Apple’s App Scaling, to provide a consistent response across the, now, three resolutions they offer.]** / ***[Apple hasn’t yet caught up with the competition, especially in the iPhone 6, where most other phones now sport 1080p screens at that small size, and 5.5 inch phones have higher resolutions, too.]*** The screen is very **[vibrant]** / ***[average]***, with **[deep]** / ***[muddled]*** blacks and colors that **[pop]** / ***[are over-saturated]***.

…

Next, the new design. Apple proves with this release that the iPhone design **[works]** / ***[has become stagnant]*** by maintaining a lot of what has made it **[great]** / ***[sell]***. The curved edges of the new design hark back to the original iPhone from 2007 and the thin design makes the devices **[easy to hold]** / ***[feel slightly slippery]***. We can all agree, though, that Apple makes a premium device, as the iPhone 6 feels very sturdy. There’s no trace of flex in the device **[and]** / ***[but]*** the new screen glass **[is nicely rounded, too]** / ***[is unproven, and we’ll have to see how it holds up]***. There’s a premium feel to this device, **[just like every other Apple device before it]** / ***[and there should be for the staggering prices these phones command]***.

…

Given that **[Flickr]** / ***[Tim Cook]*** says that the iPhone is the most popular camera on the planet, we needed to take a good hard look at what the new iPhone offers in it’s new camera. A new sensor gives the iPhone larger pixels, something useful at gathering more light for those dark shots. Our testing found that the iPhone 6 produces **[great]** / ***[relatively noise-free]*** night and low light shots. Compared to the current leader in smartphone camera’s, this new sensor is **[like night and day]** / ***[comparable]***. Daylight shots, **[thanks to]** / ***[despite]*** the new “Focus Pixels”, were clear and sharp, while focusing **[was remarkably quick]** / ***[didn’t quite match the keynote’s declarations]***. Here’s a set of sample images from **[around our office and outside]** / ***[some hipster spots in New York and some street signs]***. The OIS system in the iPhone 6 Plus is a first for Apple, and among the very first in smartphones. It works **[great]** / ***[as expected]***, producing **[sharp and focused]** / ***[a slight improvement in]*** photos, even when there’s a lot of motion going on.

…

Finally, we take a look at the battery life. While the iPhone’s of yore have had comparatively small batteries, the iPhone 6 changes that by **[increasing the capacity of each]** / ***[moving closer to the present-day battery sizes]*** to a rumoured 18xxmAh and 29xxmAh battery, respectively. This means Apple has managed to maintain the **[stellar]** / ***[previous]*** estimates of iPhone longevity. With these new battery sizes, it is **[amazing that Apple has managed to keep the form slim with this upgraded capacity]** / ***[clear Apple has seen the need to stay competitive]***. Our testing showed that, **[as usual]** / ***[under light test conditions]***, the new batteries **[managed]** / ***[died after]*** 16 and 19 hours, respectively. This is **[fantastic]** / ***[on par with other phones in their size class]***. **[Quite a great result, and it should easily last you two, or perhaps three, days on a charge for the 6 Plus.]** / ***[Still, no removable battery here, folks.]***

…

**[Compared to other phones on the market, the iPhone has some clear advantages. Without mentioning the matured App Store and ecosystem offerings that iOS brings, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus bring a great battery that lasts longer than any phone this slim (indeed, nearly every ‘phablet’ we’ve tested). The camera is an improvement over the previous iPhone and a lot of other cameras we’ve tested. The Nokia Pureview cameras still bring a huge uptick in sheer resolution, but we don’t often print posters. The phase-detection auto-focus is much welcomed, and we couldn’t find a smartphone with a comparable sensor to the iPhone 6 Plus. The device is slim and stylish, shedding thickness even as it grows. The same can be said of the Galaxy Note, who’s fourth iteration is it’s slimmest yet. But it doesn’t match the 6 Plus. You’ll be missing the SPen, though, if you move to the new iPhone. Overall, if there’s ever been a compelling case for an upgrade, it’s the iPhone 6. If there’s ever been a compelling reason to switch from Android, this could be it.]** / ***[See above for comparison. The iPhone is iterative, and the design is feeling a bit old. Sure, it’s slimmer, but that’s not all that users ask for (though NFC is in now, an omission we’ve long pined for). A replaceable battery, higher megapixel camera and a better-than-1080p display are sought after by many Android users. While Apple fans and iPhone loyalists will assuredly upgrade to this new version (as they tend to with any new release), this may be the time to look ahead to the new Note 4 or Edge, with that cool bent display.]***

apple,"I see a TON of misinformation and confusion, so: Here's now AT&amp;T Next actually works.","Disclaimer: I don't work for AT&amp;T, nor do I sell phones, nor do I care at the end of the day what plan you have.  I'm just a guy who did a lot of homework and likes people having accurate information.

##Summary
AT&amp;T Next (and Verizon Edge) basically allow you to divorce the act of owning and paying for a phone, from paying for cellular service.

##Background##
All currently available mainstream plans feature two components- a DATA charge, and a LINE charge. We will ignore the DATA charge aspect from here on out, because it's the same regardless of what plan you choose.

*AT&amp;T Next offers you a lower monthly line charge ($15 less for data plans under 10gb, $25 less for 10gb and over) in exchange for them not giving you a large subsidy when you buy your phone.  Next plans never involve a contract, and you can get out of them at any time, penalty free, by paying off the balance you owe on your phone.*  

##Apples to Apples Comparison: Keeping a phone for two years##
Let's start with the simplest case, and assume you are going to buy a phone and keep it for two years.  Whether you save more on a contract or Next here depends on whether or not your data plan is 10gb or higher, as AT&amp;T bumps the line charge from $25/mo down to $15/mo at that threshold.

All examples assume a new base iPhone 6.  Cost of acquiring and line charges after two years:

Next plan, &lt; 10gb: ~$40 sales tax on new phone + ($25 x 24 line charge) + ($27 x 24 phone payment) = **$1288** 

2 Year Contract: $210 for new phone + $30 activation + ($40 line charge x 24) = **$1200**

Next plan, &gt;= 10gb: ~$40 sales tax on new phone +  ($15 x 24 line charge) + ($27 x 24 phone payment) = **$1048**

As we see here, you pay slightly more for a Next plan versus a contract if your data plan is under 10gb.  However, that $88 buys you the flexibility to exit the deal at any time you want.  If you are 10gb or over, you get the best of both worlds, saving about $150 over two years being on Next, plus you retain full freedom to walk away at any time.

##So how does Next make AT&amp;T money?
On trade-ins.  Next gives you the OPTION, but not the obligation, to trade in the phone after either 12 or 18 months, depending on which payment schedule you choose.  Should you choose to do so, you send the phone back to AT&amp;T (it must be in salable condition), and in exchange, they forgive the remaining balance that you owe.  

Example: Month 18 of ""Next 18"" plan: Amount owed on phone is $27 x 6 remaining months = $162.  However, an 18 month old iPhone is worth substantially more than $162.  A better option is to pay off the $162 so that you own the phone free and clear, and then sell it on your own for something around $350. Then just rinse and repeat with a new phone; as AT&amp;T isn't paying for any of the phone, there's no cool-down period to start over as there is when on contract.

##Summary##
On a new iPhone, a Next plan may be slightly more expensive over two years with a small data plan, or a good deal cheaper with a family sized data plan.  Either way, the ability to walk away at any time without penalty by just paying what you owe for the phone is a valuable thing.  Trading in the phone leaves money on the table, but if you keep the phone the full two years, or pay it off and sell yourself earlier, there are few downsides to going with the Next plan.",247,302,2014-09-15,AAPL,0.07950058579444885,0.8907554149627686,0.02974397875368595

apple,Pretty indescribable Apple service experience yesterday.,"So yesterday I made a thread here and then tweeted a link to that thread about an issue I was having with iOS 8 family sharing:

http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2gouzr/family_sharing_working_for_anyone/

Out of nowhere, an Apple employee hit me up on twitter asking me to send them a DM. 

Via DM, he then worked with me to isolate the problem. I discovered that not all content was giving me that error, only a subset.  He got excited saying this is something they've been trying to track down but were not able to reproduce.  Apparently I gave them the reproduction scenario he needed.

Turns out it was some subset of iTunes content that was uploaded over 8 years ago in a bad format that Family Sharing wasn't playing nice with.  They now know what bad content to look for and are going about putting re-encoded versions of all this media on their servers so that people will not get this error going forward.

I was telling him how surprised and impressed I was with this service, given how busy a day Apple was having, for them to just see something I tweeted (I don't even have 300 followers) and follow up with me so quickly.  He said that they had a ""War Room"" at Apple trawling through social media and everything they could find looking for anyone having issues (particularly with Family Sharing) so they could address them ASAP.

I am really blown away by this.  Apple long ago earned my trust and loyalty, but they continue to bank goodwill with me at virtually every opportunity.

If I ask weather, it'll tell me the forecast for today and then what to expect tomorrow. Siri is dramatically improved and it seems like nobody even mentions it

apple,Jony Ive quote from his biography,"'The computer industry “is an industry that has become incredibly conservative from a design perspective,” he said. “It is an industry where there is an obsession about product attributes that you can measure empirically. How fast is it? How big is the hard drive? How fast is the CD? That is a very comfortable space to compete in because you can say eight is better than six.”22
But Jony offered a key insight: “It’s also very inhuman and very cold. Because of the industry’s obsession with absolutes, there has been a tendency to ignore product attributes that are difficult to measure or talk about. In that sense, the industry has missed out on the more emotive, less tangible product attributes. But to me, that is why I bought an Apple computer in the first place. That is why I came to work for Apple. It’s because I’ve always sensed that Apple had a desire to do more than the bare minimum. It wasn’t just going to do what was functionally and empirically necessary. In the early stuff, I got a sense that care was taken even on details, hard and soft, that people may never discover.'",115,349,2014-09-20,AAPL,0.06348581612110138,0.8910872340202332,0.045426931232213974

apple,"4G wireless, a Verizon authorized reseller, is being INCREDIBLY shady with the iPhone sales, and people need to know","I got to the store on launch, and I was the first one in.

They asked me which phone I wanted, I selected it. They asked me to sign a document saying I'm upgrading for 2 years, I signed it. Then they went to the back, came out with my phone.

Except. The phone had a bowtie, and was bundled to tons of accessories. I said I didn't want them. They told me I had no choice but to take them, as they didn't have ""just iPhones"" available for sale.

The bundle had the following items; $40 car charger, $40 wall charger, $25 case, ~$20 cover, and $80 wireless headphones. It came up to $200 extra, and they told me if I wanted the phone ,I had to get this.

I know apple frowns upon this, and there was a big dispute in 2007 when AT&amp;T did something similar. I got the phone, because mine broke and I really needed one. But I was going to return it today, and they said ""$100 restocking fee, but the accessories are NON-refundable"", claiming that when I signed the invoice it said this.

apple,PSA: Don't force close your apps!,"It's day 2, so I figured I'd put this information out there for everyone. Some may already know this, but for those that don't...

As the title says, don't force close your apps. Unless they are having a problem that is.
If the app isn't responding, is crashing, etc., force close. If, on the other hand, it's working great, do not close those apps. By force closing all of your apps you are negatively impacting both battery life and performance of the device. 

Here's how it works:

When you open an app it's in the RAM. When you stop using the app it's in a saved (paused, frozen) state. In this state it uses very little RAM. As you use more and more apps the amount builds up. If an app needs more space they'll automatically be cleared out. When you open an app that's already in multitasking it is easier on the device and requires less power and resources.

When an app has an issue you can force it to reset, which often times fixes the problem. 

Force closing apps when they aren't experiencing a problem is not a good idea for a few reasons. Some I mentioned above, noting that it is easier for the phone to open apps, and saves you battery, if they are already in multitasking. By closing all of your apps, every time you open the apps again the phone is cold booting them, from a completely closed state. This is taxing on the processor and the battery. 

Ever notice how day one your battery life seems to be lower than normal, and after that everything is ok? It's due to all of the downloading activity, but also the opening of all of your apps. On day two most of your commonly used apps have been opened and don't have to open from a closed state, so your phone doesn't work nearly as hard. 

TL;DR Save your battery and keep performance at at a max by not closing apps unless they are not working properly. And spread the word!

EDIT 1: Since a lot of you have been asking, if you have apps such as Facebook, Google, Viber, and others that want to always check your location while not in use or to check for incoming messages (Facebook, Skype, Viber, and others like those), you can disable those functions by going to 

Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh  

and disable any apps here that you don't want running so heavily. 

To answer another question, the apps in multitasking are recently used Apps, not necessarily ones that are running. The only ones that still have any processes running (location services and checking for incoming calls/messages) are ones that have Background App Refresh on. Alternatively you can go into 

Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services 

and disable location services for any apps you don't want using it or that you don't feel need that option on. 

I will try to answer as many questions as I can, but I do have work today so I'll be out for a time. 

Remember: don't be the janitor of your device, it takes care of that on its own.

apple,The Grown-up Guide to Apple.,"We all know the sites and bloggers/vloggers that peddle rumors, superficial news, hardware/software reviews. But where to turn when you want expert, in-depth analysis of Apple's ethos, business, culture, etc? When you want to sound smart about Apple, these are the folks I recommend reading: 

* [John Gruber of Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) (writer/blogger) -  The quintessential non-official Apple apologist. Doesn't mean he always agrees. But if you want a definitive understanding of Apple's ethos, look no further. 

* [Benedict Evans](http://ben-evans.com) (VC analyst for Andreessen Horowitz) - Highly-regarded tech analyst. He and Dediu (below) are the two guys to read if you want great insight into Apple's business and cultural strategy. They also talk about the tech industry as a whole. 

* [Horace Dediu of Asymco](http://www.asymco.com) (industry analyst) - He makes occasional appearances on CNBC and other business-related shows. Extremely in-tune with Apple's business strategy and philosophy, and has amazingly-detailed graphs and charts. He and Evans are often-quoted by Gruber. 

* [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org) (app developer and enthusiast) - Creator of famous apps like Instapaper and Overcast. Bit of an ass, but fun to read/listen to.

* [Steve Cheney](http://stevecheney.com) (programmer, industry analyst) - Another oft-quoted writer, keen insight into Apple's ethos as well. Quiet on blog these days but active on Twitter.

* [Stephen Hackett of 512 Pixels](http://512pixels.net) (design and marketing guru) - Great insights into Apple's design ethos, from web to software. 

* [John Siracusa](http://hypercritical.co) (tech writer, developer) - Famous for his intensely detailed reviews of Apple products, rivaling Anand Lal Shimpi. Quiet on blog these days but active on Twitter.

* [Jared Sinclair](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com) (app developer, blogger) - Famous for his Unread RSS app, I look to him (and Marco) to get a developer's perspective on where Apple's going. 

Any other folks that I've missed? I intentionally left out Walt Mossberg and David Pogue since they're more popular writers from big tech/news websites.

iphone,"""Set As Wallpaper"" Always made my pictures look horrible. I figured out why!","I've seen some topics on this before but I never came across a clear answer so that's why I'm making this post. I'm really sorry if a lot of people already know this. I couldn't find the answer I wanted/needed so, even if this solution is known,  I hope it helped someone!

Like many others, I enjoy saving high quality images (.jpg) and setting them as wallpaper. For the longest time, I've wondered why some images seemed to degrade in quality after setting as wallpaper. I'd notice this most on my homescreen. I eventually just accepted that iOS compresses the images to save memory (this was what I had read).

Today, I was shocked at how great a wallpaper looked on my new iPhone 6, and I thought it was just the great display. But it wasn't! I had actually set a screenshot of the original image as wallpaper, rather than the original image. Screenshots save as .PNG when pictures on our iPhone's are taken as .JPG (of course as well as many pictures you download). 

It turns out that iOS DOES compress files when setting as wallpaper, but when PNG's are compressed, they do not lose quality. JPG's DO lose quality! 

So now when setting a JPG as wallpaper, I take a screenshot first of how I'd like it to look on my lockscreen, THEN set the screenshot as wallpaper.

Linked are sample images of the issue/solution. First, is the original picture. Second, is the original picture set as wallpaper. Third is a screenshot of the original image then set as wallpaper.

This is some totally fucked up shit, and the other redditor is having the same issue while using AT&amp;T so be careful. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

edit 4: **HOW TO FIX YOUR IPHONE MANUALLY** - so a few redditors have confirmed they were able to downgrade back to iOS 8.0. First you need to download the IPSW file for your iPhone, that usually means find the carrier specific file. But it looks like there are two different IPSW files for all iPhone 6 and 6 Plus regardless of carrier. FILENAME: iPhone7,2_8.0_12A365_Restore.ipsw  is for the iPhone 6.  FILENAME: iPhone7,1_8.0_12A366 is for the iPhone 6 Plus. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post links here to the direct download sites, but there are several in the comment section below. 

Once you download the right IPSW file, open iTunes and hold the SHIFT (ON PC) or Option (ON MAC) button then click ""Restore iPhone"". From there you can choose the IPSW file and it should work (apple just pulled the 8.0.1 update so I'm sure 8.0 will still be active/signed). 

edit 5: **HOW TO FIX YOUR IPHONE AS INSTRUCTED BY APPLE**

**""If you updated and are experiencing issues such as TouchID failing and/or cellular connectivity issues, restoring from iTunes on your computer will fix these issues while preserving the 8.0.1 update.""**                                                      I have tried this option and gotten nowhere myself, as iTunes does nothing after I click restore so I will continue with the IPSW manual fix. 

**LAST EDIT: So reverting back to 8.0 worked for me! Just make a backup right now before you revert to 8.0 and don't worry about 8.0.1 being backed up, it only backs up data/pics etc. Once you do your manual downgrade to 8.0, you can just ""Restore from Backup"" and you'll get all your data back WITHOUT the 8.0.1 bugs.**

 Alright guys I've done zero work in my office for the last 2 hours, have to go now. Good luck!

Edit x3 - Apple appears to have pulled the ""Update"" for the time being

-

Since this is a sticky I thought I would clean it up a bit:

The new 8.0.1 Update appears to transform the iPhone 6/6+ into iPod Touch (5th gen). :)

The cellular radios (WiFi works) stop responding, and TouchID also is non-functional. 

Apple knows about the issue and a patch should be coming shortly!

-

Edit: as /u/TradableAvocado &amp; /u/Awsaim confirmed this appears to be a 6/6+ problem only

-

Edit x2: /u/Beta382 &amp; /u/spar13 posted below guides to restore 8.0 to your device. While it will not wipe the device  I'd recommend making a backup. Personally I am going to wait until Apple responds before doing this, I dont need cellular for a bit. Rolling back software on a device can lead to more bugs in the future.

apple,"A rant over ""Bendgate""","The ""Bendgate"" where iPhone supposedly bends over severe conditions of the phone. But anyways, I have something to rant about it. 

Today, I was shopping for few things so I stopped by Apple and Best Buy to check out the iPhone 6. 

- At the Apple Store, I see some of the iPhone 6 demo units were missing. Apparently people are going to the Apple Store and ""bending"" the iPhone 6. Then a few minutes later, police officers go inside the Apple Store to talk to someone that recently bent the iPhone 6 and refused to pay for the damages. Apparently this happened ten minutes before I entered the store. 

- Best Buy, I check out the iPhone 6 Plus because I'm more interested to purchase this iPhone. I check it out and some people tell me ""It's a bad phone. It bends"", ""Watch me to bend this iPhone"", ""Galaxy is better because it doesn't bend"" and so on. Then few minutes later, I leave the iPhone area and I see a parent and a kid bending the iPhone 6 and cops were called. 

For my rant, the iPhone has been bent since the iPhone 4 but didn't make to the mainstream media. But in all seriousness, this shit is getting fucking annoying. It's a phone, meant to be used as a phone and taken with care. Instead of going with ""all your might"" to bend a damn phone. 

So /r/apple, discuss over this ""Bendgate"" because this is annoying as hell.",292,330,2014-09-26,AAPL,0.5778108239173889,0.40048614144325256,0.021703053265810013

apple,A few pictures and impressions from the Apple x Colette event in Paris,"Hello Reddit !

I've just come back from the shop, and without further ado, [here are the few (bad) pictures I took.](http://imgur.com/a/GaJXd)

A few more things :

* While I didn't get such a close look at the device, it obviously looks very well finished. Especially the classic line is really nice, while the Sport casing doesn't look so refined, especially in light grey. The gold on the Edition model doesn't look too tacky, although the finish doesn't impress nearly as much if the device is going to cost several thousand dollars as some people speculated.
* The metal bands are impressive, espcially the link band is gorgeous in person (although you might be able to guess from the album it's not the one I'll buy). The leather bands are good-looking as well, however they don't feel incredibly premium. I wouldn't expect these to sell for more than 50$. 
* The bezels are much less visible than photos make it appear. It actually looks closer to Apple's renders than to pictures when it comes to the screen's edge.
* Both sizes look quite a bit smaller than I thought. While I'll get the 38mm watch due to my tiny wrists, I expect most men to pick the 42mm one.
* I don't know whether this is a scoop or we already knew that... The Apple Watch will enable Apple Pay on iPhone 5/5C/5S.
* Apparently the classic Watch won't be much more expensive than the Sport, if at all. However the employee seemed to be unsure about it.
* I've never seen this many iPhone 6.",155,494,2014-09-30,AAPL,0.032833561301231384,0.9082590341567993,0.0589074082672596

iphone,Just Unexpectedly Bought a 6 Plus and...,"I really would like to express how thankful I am for Joe at the South Hills, Pittsburgh store! I drive two hours to get to the store before they closed after seeing the 6 Plus in stock there, and I got there right around 8:50. The first employee I talked to said they were holding the stock for tomorrow to ensure they had phones and wouldn't budge, even to tell me how many they had to see whether it would be worth another drive tomorrow. 

Well just as I was leaving the store, Joe came up and asked what I needed help with and after hearing how far I had driven, he went back and got me a phone! Not only that, but he stayed well beyond closing to help me through some unforeseen issues while processing my upgrade (thanks, AT&amp;T). This guy is a model Apple employee, and even though he probably won't see this, I just wanna say thanks, Joe!",41,169,2014-09-30,AAPL,0.033641066402196884,0.8684438467025757,0.09791512042284012
