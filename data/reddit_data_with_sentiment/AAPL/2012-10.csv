I'm French and I used to switch between French AZERTY and English QWERTY *all_the_time* depending on which language I wanted to use, which meant that texting two different people speaking two different languages at the same time was an absolute pain in the ass.



BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. Yes, because iOS 6 remembers which layout you use for which contact or even which application. It knows to stay in QWERTY for Alien Blue and my English-speaking classmates, but also to revert back to AZERTY when I'm texting my dad.

apple,Iphone dropped into a lake in April.  I just got it out.,"Update on the iphone...

http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/12gxfz/iphone_dropped_into_a_lake_update/

Below: Original Post

Back in April of 2012 my iphone was dropped from a dock into a lake.  It fell into around 6 feet of water.  Due to the way the lake level's are maintained it was out of the water this weekend. I picked it up and cleaned it a touch.  Believe it or not, the darn thing turns on when you plug it in.  The screen is a little fudged up and it won't hold a charge or connect to the computer, but the damn thing turns on.

It was underwater for almost 6 months.

Any ideas what I should do with it?  The touchscreen works fine. No sound though....

Edit 1: Apple, I am impressed.

Edit 2: Here is an image link: http://imgur.com/a/gtkYC

iphone,If you are accepting being throttled by AT&amp;T you may as well get some money for it.,"I have seen a few posts on being throttled by AT&amp;T and it is unfortunate that these discussions consist mainly of complaining and making AT&amp;T's arguments for them. More constructive would be to discuss what the consumer can do about it. The purpose of this post is to help those who have been throttled find some remedy. This is based on my own experience.

When you get throttled the first step is to file a notice of dispute with AT&amp;T where you tell them the problem and what you want (stop throttling me and give me MONEYS). This is a 2 question form and can be found here.

http://www.att.com/support_media/images/pdf/Wireless/1239368042948.Notice_of_Dispute_Form.pdf

AT&amp;T will have 30 days to respond to this dispute. Next you will get a call within 30 days from an AT&amp;T rep. This is someone who works with the legal department, but who is not a lawyer. They will say that before speaking with you you need to sign a non disclosure agreement. Whether  you sign it or not they will still speak with you about settlement (I obviously didn't sign it). 

This begins the negotiation phase. Before you really get into it, you need to decide what you want accomplished and you should understand what AT&amp;T wants accomplished. For me, limiting my unlimited plan was a breach of our contract and I wanted them to stop doing it. AT&amp;T's position is that they want to extinguish their liability for breaching the contract. They will attempt to do this by paying you to consent to change your contract. For example, AT&amp;T will offer to give you say $300 for you to either change to a limited plan, or keep your unlimited plan while accepting that you will be throttled after using 3gb. To me these two options are identical because you can only really use 3gb either way.


So the amount of money they will offer you comes down to how long you have been throttled and maybe your negotiations skills. In the end you will have to sign a settlement agreement which will insulate AT&amp;T from future liability about this and it will include a confidentiality clause.

This is where I got, but I refused to sign the settlement agreement because of the confidentiality clause. During the whole negotiation I maintained that there would not be confidentiality and then on the settlement form they just threw it in there. The final offer I got was for $1000, but I still refused to sign it because of the confidentiality agreement. 

I did not accept my settlement so that I could help others do this. I hope that you take advantage of it. I'll try and answer any questions you might have.

TL:DR If you are accepting being throttled by AT&amp;T, file a dispute and get money first.

apple,FYI: iMac recall on bad Hard Drives,"Received this email yesterday

Dear iMac owner,

Apple has determined that certain 1TB Seagate hard drives used in 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac systems may fail. These systems were sold between October 2009 and July 2011.

Our records show that you have an iMac with an affected 1TB Seagate hard drive. Apple will replace your hard drive with a new one, free of charge, under the iMac 1TB Seagate Hard Drive Replacement Program.

Please choose one of the following options to get a replacement hard drive.
•
Apple Retail Store - Set up an appointment with a Genius.
•
Apple Authorized Service Provider - Find one here.
•
Apple Technical Support - Contact us for local service options.
Apple recommends replacing your affected hard drive as soon as possible. Before you go in for service, please back up your data. Learn more about backup options.

Additional Information

You will need to have the original Mac OS installation discs that were shipped with your iMac in order to reinstall your operating system, other applications, and any backed up data after your hard drive is replaced.

This worldwide Apple program does not extend the standard warranty coverage of the iMac.

Apple will replace affected 1TB Seagate hard drives, free of charge, for three years from your iMac’s original date of purchase or until April 12, 2013, whichever provides longer coverage for you. Apple will continue to evaluate service data and provide extensions to this program as needed.

We apologize for any inconvenience.

Sincerely,

Will it look exactly like the dummy models we've seen leaked numerous times? What about the iPad 3? How will it feel to have a smaller upstart taking its spotlight away?

I thought you might like the iPhone app I just created. It's called [Stitch It!](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id554594252?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4) and it allows you to create a seamless image of a conversation so you can share it without having to upload multiple screenshots of it (or splice it together in Photoshop). You can use it on iMessage conversations, Facebook conversations--if there's any sort of long screenshot you'd like to take, this app can help you to make and share it.

Here's an example of what a final image looks like: http://i.imgur.com/u22VG.jpg

I hope you like Stitch It! ([in the app store here.](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id554594252?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4))  If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions about any of the stitching or sharing options offered by this app, feel free to comment below, and we'll take it into consideration for the subsequent updates.  Cheers!

Edit 01: These are all apps that maximise my personal work flow/improve my personal OS X experience, there are of course many alternatives, feel free to list them too.

Edit 02: Descriptions added.

Edit 03: Ok, so it seems like some people take this stuff super seriously so I have edited the format and also added a couple of things that have been mentioned by y'all. Some things aren't worth mentioning as I assume most people would already have them (ie. [VLC Media Player](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.videolan.org%2Fvlc%2Findex.html&amp;ei=EQ2MUFKF-a0HycWAsAU&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBhuuzYHOSa3E8AKS6WdxI_OOjYQ&amp;sig2=qpH4RlgMxdH8NfgCXWjjyw), [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com), [uTorrent](http://utorrent.com/), [DropBox](http://dropbox.com/), etc.), and some things I have left out because they have very specialised uses that only certain people require (ie. [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/), [Transmit](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpanic.com%2Ftransmit%2F&amp;ei=2A6MUIyPLpGqrAelmYDACw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVE0Hy-HUbateLIVvcexT1PNaNdQ&amp;sig2=rm-K64AoIsQjH8sY-JEA7A), [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com), [xScope](http://xscopeapp.com), etc.).

Also, I find 'Utilities' to be things that mainly run in the background/from the Menu Bar and 'Apps' to be standalone programs - sorry if this isn't 100% accurate.

I will add more as I test them, thanks for all your input so far!

Edit 04: May I suggest a quick Command+F before suggesting anymore Apps/Utilities as we are now getting a lot of duplicates.

Also, many questions and alternatives have already been mentioned.",472,1221,2012-10-27,AAPL,0.04786483198404312,0.9222379326820374,0.02989726886153221

apple,Apple just earned a ton of my respect.,"Here's the story. My brother gives me the cash and asks me to go to our local apple store and get my nephew the new iPod touch. He also asks me to get everything set up, test it out, and make sure it's ready to go. My nephews birthday is so close to Christmas and the plan was to give the iPod to him so he could be using it during the holiday season to take pictures, record HD videos and what not. 

So I'm at the house, I've been trying it out for a few days. It's a great device. Since not many cases are available, I used a small ankle sock to keep it in. I decided to sync it one last time and then put it back in the package. This time I didn't leave the sock on... it fell off the desk and put a large dent/scratch on it. Needless to say I was shitting a brick. 

I called apple, they said they didn't know what to tell me because they couldn't see it over the phone of course and that I needed to set up a genius appointment. So I did and went in to see what could be done. I was scared to death that I was gonna have to put it on Craigslist at a reduced price and then pay the difference for a new one.

One of the employees greets me and I tell her the situation. I apologize because the problem sounds so petty. But I can't give a damaged gift to someone. She says she completely understands ""Let me go talk to my manager."". I'm sitting there expecting the worst when she returns and says ""We're going to replace it for you free of charge."". I was dumbfounded and extremely relieved at the same time. It was my screw up and they totally bailed me out.

People can complain about Apple all day long about the price of their products and that it's all fad but I say this. I don't know any other company with the kind of customer service they have and I truly appreciate the employees and what they do.


Edit: After reading some of the comments, let me clarify a few things. I only had the device for two days when it happened and only at my home. I didn't carry it around everywhere. I put it in a sock to keep it safe while out of the box. The reason I was asked to set it up is because my brother currently does't have a home PC or Internet connection. He won't until at least December. I'd hate for him to turn it on and only be able to sit and stare at the activation screen until he could get to a wifi connection.


Edit2: Some people have asked why I'm messing with a gift for someone else. Like I said above, no internet at his home, therefore no way to download apps. He's 10 years old and this is probably the most expensive gift he's ever gotten. I love my nephew and when he opens his present and see's the ipod I want him to be able to enjoy it.

apple,A quick primer on Skeuomorphism: what it is and what it isn't.,"First off, my qualification for writing this is that I took a semester of HCI (human-computer interaction) in college as part of my computer science degree. Since then I've always been interested in UI though I don't do much related work professionally (I'm a programmer but I don't work on UI). So I'm sure there are other, smarter people out there who can add more, but I thought this might be helpful to a lot of people.

Skeuomorphism, as it applies to computer interfaces, means making software that looks and works similar to an older, non-digital version of something similar. An example of this is iBooks.

But it can be helpful to break skeuomorphism down into two separate parts: visual design and interaction. Visual design simply means that the interface *looks* like the non-digital version of itself, interaction means that the interface *works* like the non-digital version of itself. iBooks does both of these very well: it *looks* like a book, and it *works* like a book. This is a good example because the design of the app leads the user to instantly understand how it works. ""This looks like a book, so I bet I have to turn the page with my finger to get to more content.""

Skeumorphism, in general, is a good thing when done well, and iBooks is an example of that. A worse example is the Calendar app on iPad. It follows a skeuomorphic visual design in that it looks like a wall calendar, but other than the ability to swipe between pages, the interaction with the calendar is almost entirely done with button presses. In this case, the skeuomorphic visual design is needless, because it isn't followed up by skeuomorphic interactions.

The Game Center app is a poor example of skeuomorphism. In the strictest sense, the app is designed to look like a poker table, and you do play games on a poker table, and you do play games on Game Center. But the actual Game Center app is mostly for browsing games and friends, so really, the app isn't in any way a ""modern version"" of a poker table, thus, this barely qualifies as skeuomorphism at all.

My last example, Find My Friends, is an example of an app which is simply NOT skeuomorphic. Find My Friends doesn't have a non-digital analog. Instead, it's just a needless use of a particular style (in this case, stitched leather). Some people might think it makes it looks nice, but the consensus within the community seems to be that it does not, which makes this just an example of poor graphic design.

**TL;DR**:

* Skeuomorphism ~~is~~ **can be** a good thing when done well.
* Useful to look at it in terms of visual design (does it *look* like the analog version?) and interaction (does it *work* like the analog version?).
* iBooks is an example of good skeuomorphism (visual design and interaction match each other).
* Calendar is an example of bad skeuomorphism (visual design matches the analog system but not the interaction).
* Game Center and Find My Friends are not skeuomorphism, they're just bad visual design.

Edit: Thanks for the feedback, I'm glad some people found this useful. I've clarified a few things in this post (such as the fact that ""design"" refers to both *visual* design and *interaction* design, and just saying ""design"" isn't specific enough).",61,198,2012-10-30,AAPL,0.048177678138017654,0.923042356967926,0.028779931366443634

apple,Why Tim Cook nailed the announcement on the senior management changes.,"Amazing execution. Apple's recent announcement on senior management changes could have turned out bad - potentially causing stocks to fall, Apple faithfuls to lose faith, and sales to decrease. But this announcement was made based on numerous ingenious reasons.

Here's what I think they considered:

- This announcement was made the same time Microsoft officially launched Windows 8 and Google released their three Nexus devices, causing reporters to talk much less about Apple's competitors.

- Both Forstall and Browett were fired at the same time but Cook planned to fire Browett a long time ago. He realized that firing them one at a time would cause investors and Apple faithfuls to lose confidence in Apple (investors might think: ""One firing after the next. When will all this end? The future is uncertain!""). So instead, he packed this whole management change into one single big announcement, letting the world know exactly what Apple is up to, and the fact that Apple is not going to make more unexpected changes to stir up panic.

- Hurricane Sandy caused the stock market to shut down, so this announcement won't cause any immediate changes in Apple's stock price. After the amazing iPad Mini reviews and the opening of the stock market, Apple stocks will rise instead.

- The new iPad Mini just landed into the hands of many reviewers including Pogue, Mossberg, Siegler, Gruber as well as many tech news sites. Reviews couldn't have been more positive. All discussion about Apple will now go from Forstall to the iPad Mini. Investors will gain lots of hope again, right at the time when the stock market will open.

- Lastly, Forstall will realize the huge amount of praise given to the iPad Mini's hardware design (courtesy of Jony Ive), and maybe recognize some of his mistakes and have more respect for Jony.
