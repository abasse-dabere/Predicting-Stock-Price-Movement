iphone,I made a free and ad free meme generator app. Am I doing this right?,"I made a free meme generator. It is called meme design and here is the link: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-design/id490532286?ls=1&amp;mt=8

**edit:I forgot to mention that there is also an ipad version of the app as well!**

 I need reddits feedback on it to help make it better.  The next version I plan on implementing:

many more meme templates (I realize a lot are missing right now)
*import from camera
*move text
*change text color

reddit, you suggest the ideas and I will implement them.  The ad will always be free.  The only plans for the future is to use this app (if it gets popular enough) to promote a website version of it which will have some (non intrusive) ads.

**Suggestions that will be implemented so far: 

* sort templates abc order and have a tab for the most popular meme's

* search templates

* Save created meme's in app

* Share feature send in txt message

* When sharing to reddit, chose which subreddit

* copy image to clipboard

apple,My 2012 project: Get an external PCIe GPU running on my 13 inch 2011 MacBook Pro.,"First I need [this](http://store1.sonnettech.com/product_info.php?products_id=392) ThunderBolt Expresscard bat from Sonnet.  It's $149 and allows connection of ExpressCard/34 cards.

Next I will need the [PE4H](http://www.hwtools.net/Adapter/PE4H.html) passive PCIe to mPCIE (ExpressCard/34) adaptor.  This will plug into the GPU and the Sonnet ThunderBolt box, and is $91.

Now I need a GPU.  I have a spare Asus GTS250 kicking around which is good enough for testing.

Of course, I will need a spare power supply to power the GPU.  I can use an ATX PSU or an AC one apparently.  This is the part that I am still fuzzy on.  It looks like you need about 75 watts per 6 pin, and 150 per 8 pin.  The card I have I think has a single 6 pin, so 75 should do it.  To make sure it works with something else later, I will try to use a 300 watt PSU.

I then plant to test it on a BootCamp Windows 7 64 install.

The next step after that will be enclose it in a nice case.  Hopefully I can get it running on AC so I don't need the bulk and expense of a PSU.

The idea behind it is simple.  I have this thundering gaming desktop  and other than the GPU and monitor the whole thing is redundant to the parts in my MBP for the most part.

I want to keep the desktop for now upstairs for regular gaming, but I am an avid sim racer and want to have my wheel and pedals downstairs with the big TV.  The little box would be perfect, as I can then plug my MBP into it and game there.  Trying to coexist a sim racing setup with regular computing and other gaming in a small space is difficult and cumbersome.

If you have a 17"" MBP with the card slot (or any other machine with a card slot) you don't need the Sonnet box.

EDIT: Here is where I got the information from.  I am going off of their tested 3dmark06 scores as a baseline.  If these numbers are to be contested, I want to know why this source is incorrect.  If I was making this up off the cuff I could understand.

apple,I used Find My iPhone to track and apprehend the thief who stole my bag...,"This is a story of an asshole who stole the wrong guy's bag.

On the final day of possibly the greatest weekend on record, we were about to leave Whistler, British Columbia to catch our flight home. We were here for a location wedding with close friends and had an amazing time.  My girlfriend, a friend and I said our long goodbyes and headed down to our rental vehicle and noticed the passenger window had been smashed and my messenger bag was gone....fuck.

Contents of bag included:

* Passport
* Car, house and office keys
* iPad
* Jambox
* Various important papers


Enter Batman mode.

Open Find My iPhone app and cross fingers this idiot doesn't know about it's traceable nature.

Remote lock: activated. 

Thank god....i located my iPad on the move in a hotel across the street.  I head the the courtyard in the radius of the signal; looking around trying to identify my bag on the dozens of people surrounding me.

I've dreamt about using this feature if someone ever stole my gear, but in reality, it's difficult in a busy street. I call the RCMP as I'll need some assistance in case this guy (or girl) is nefarious thug.

They arrive quickly as I'm constantly refreshing the location.  I show him my app and brief him on the situation.  It seems to be moving through one of the hotels but I can't pinpoint it exactly. With no real accurate location we start lapping the area, staying within the radius.

It's not really moving. Seems to be in a hotel. The cop explains that we can't be going around knocking on all the rooms...I agree and after a few laps and 30 minutes, decide that it's starting to look like a lost cause. I wasn't getting an accurate enough reading.

I send a message to my iPad: ""Fuck you"", it said.

When you send a message through the app, you have the option of playing an annoying radar like sound for 2 minutes. I didn't do this initially as I thought it would scare him off.

I head back to the parkade and show the officer the scene of the theft. He takes some pics and I answer some questions and my girlfriend starts the process of rescheduling our flight. My dream of using this app to catch a bad guy seems to be fading and I prepare myself to replace all the items that were stolen...not the end of the world but a raging pain.

The RCMP leave me a card with a file number and explain that if I find this guy, follow him and call them immediately.

Soon after they leave and we start the process of patching up the window with cardboard and garbage bags as its pouring rain. I take one last look at my iPads location and shit...it's on the move and the location seems accurate. 

Never give up!  Never surrendaaaaar. 

I run towards its location. It's moving down the pedestrian main street in Whistler called ""Village Stroll"". As I'm moving I'm sending him messages and playing the annoying sound:

&gt;If you try and use this iPad, the RCMP will track you

&gt;Drop the bag. Keep the iPad. I just want my fucking keys

The movement stops in a square and there's not many people around. I play the sound remotely without sending a message this time and seconds after I send...I hear it!

A somewhat normal looking dude walks past me in the opposite direction. As the sound goes off, he looks at his Quicksilver bag and veers into a clothing shop. I call the RCMP back and as my mind is racing I'm trying to explain to dispatch that I've found the guy I called about earlier....she has no idea what I'm talking about so I have to reexplain the situation as I watch this guy pretending to shop.

In what seemed like an eternity, I waited on the line describing the individual and watched him casually blend in as a shopper. 

Finally, I see one of the RCMP that were helping me initially. I hang up and point him out. He heads out of the store and up the sidewalk away from us, he knows the RCMP are around. The officer I'm with radios ahead of us and tells another officer to cut him off.

The thief sees this and ducks into a coffee shop...

I'm told to stay put and the two officers head in the shop and grab the guy, put him in cuffs and start looking through his bag. My iPad and Jambox are there along with a huge amount of stolen merchandise but none of my ID or keys...fuck.  Apparently this guy has been kicked out of the town a few times and is well known. 

I stay away from the scene and listen to them talk. The guy explains he found the bag and was trying to find the owner...pfffff. Eventually he admits his guilt and in exchange for me not charging him, he tells the officers the location of my bag.

We head back to the initial radius I had tracked him to earlier and into a public washroom. Apparently he ditched it in the garbage.  My new found RCMP friend throws on some gloves and roots through the garbage...DING DING DING!  My bag was there but my travel wallet was not. Another radio conversation happens and we head to a different hotel public washroom to find my travel wallet buried amongst the filth.

""It *NEVER* works out like this"" the RCMP explain to me.

I express a huge amount of gratitude for the help and I get some in return for locating the bad guy. It was a fun little game.

**TL;DR** Bad guy smashes window and takes my bag containing my iPad. Use Find My iPhone to track him down and coordinate his arrest and get all my stuff back...I am batman.

**UPDATE:**I've been in contact with the RCMP and am going to cooperate at they build their case against him.  As some of the other comments described, it's not me that gets to make the choice on if he gets charged, it's up to the Crown.  It's up to me if I want to attend court or not...Which, if it gets that far, I will attend.",105,578,2012-01-03,AAPL,0.05558593571186066,0.9109731614589691,0.03344091959297657

apple,Show me evidence of a Mac virus in the wild.,"I have tried to find some kind of evidence of an actual working (not proof of concept) virus for this current version of OSx.

There are a lot of claims that Macs can't get viruses, then people saying they can.

I am sure they can, I just want to see one, a video, a pic of the result, something.

I am apparently not savvy enough to be able to find anything that can infect 10.7 in the wild.

I would like to be proved wrong and learn something here.  Its just seems there are too many opposing views on something that should be pretty easily quanitified.

http://www.iantivirus.com/threats/ is the most comprehensive list I can find.  This shows 116 threats, mixed malware and such, most are from the past or proof of concept.

My conclusion is that with daily time machine backups, I don't need to care.  Prove me wrong /r/apple.  if anyone can its everyone.

mac,What's the deal with Growl now?,"So I keep getting a notification from Growl to upgrade Growl via the App Store. 

I certainly understand that Lion changed some things and somethingsomething sandboxing blahblah tech stuff I don't get yadda yadda, hence there's got to be a new version of Growl specific to Lion. 

But what was once free software is now $1.99 and only available through the App Store. The two bucks doesn't concern me; I'm happy to support good software, esp if it's only two bucks. But what does concern me is the boatload of reviews on the App Store that says the new version (Growl 1.3.2) doesn't work (apparently because now everyone that had written an app to work with Growl 1.2 has to re-do it to work with Growl 1.3).  

Further adding to the confusion, is [this Growl blog post](http://growl.posterous.com/growl-13-a-summary-of-the-major-changes) that says ""Growl is no longer free to download . . . but you don't need Growl to get notifications. When developers update their application to support Growl 1.3, Growl will no longer be required for them to display a notification to you."" Huh? WTF am I giving you two dollars for then?!

Complicate it even further by the fact that since Growl is open source, it's still possible to get it (presumably Growl 1.3.2) without paying for it by [building it from the source code yourself](http://growl.info/documentation/developer/growl-source-install.php) . . . which again, for us less technical folk, quickly gets into blahblah mercurial yaddayadda Google Code somethingsomething oh look it's time for NCIS re-runs, *thankgod*. 

Wait! More wrinkles! There's also something called [Growl Fork](http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/19/growl-fork-brings-growl-notifications-to-mac-os-x-lion-for-free/) which (since Growl is open source, see above) takes the pre-Lion 1.2.2 version of Growl and does somethingsomething XCode 4.1 blahblah compiles cleanly yaddayadda and now it's 1.2.*2f1* instead of plain ol' 1.2.2. And ""if you don’t need the newer features in the official version and just want compatibility with Lion and your apps to continue receiving notifications, Growl Fork works just fine."" Well, okay, that sound great, but what are the newer features and since the blog post about 1.3 says ""you don't need Growl to get notifications"" do I even need 1.3 for those ""newer features""?!

Sigh. Can someone sort this out for me?

I'm not in favor of one or the other, but the PC suits my needs so I use it.

apple,"Apple, you win","I really wanted a tablet, and I am an android advocate. I have however always agreed that iOS was far better than Android when talking about tablets. Anyway, I wanted to buy an iPad2 but suddenly changed my mind and bought a Motorola Xoom 2 (Xyboard at Verizon) because I wanted to stick to what I believed in (a fair enough reason to be stubborn).

I used the tablet for 2 days, and when showing it to my colleagues, it literally crashed... I won't mention the fact that honeycomb is the worst OS I have ever seen, even Nokia would have done something better (uh, maybe not). For instance the browsing experience was rubbish; reddit wasn't displayed properly in ""browser"".

On top of having released a laggy OS, Google isn't offering anything convincing in terms of ecosystem. When you go to the market you can't easily find tablet specific apps like on the App Store, and only one category is dedicated to them (featured staff choice, something like that, but it really looks like ""we put there what we could""). Even the Google apps are laggy, what a joke.

The relatively funny thing is that - blindly happy - [I asked /r/android](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/o3yc6/i_bought_a_motorola_xoom_2_101_xyboard_if_you/) if they had questions about the tablet, so I could help them in making their choice to buy one or not, the day after or so, the aforementioned crash happened (I caught it [on video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGSoaKp8C1U&amp;sns=em)) and I suddenly felt really disappointed and stupid with my frozen tablet, [still switched on in my bag](http://i.imgur.com/P5HI7.jpg). After only two days of painful tablet joy, it was definitely not a good sign.

I am returning the tablet to Amazon and advice anyone I can to avoid it, and to avoid everything bigger than a phone that runs Android, because it is still a rubbish experience for a lot of money (they will get it right, maybe in 2013, who knows). I've always been the basic Apple hater, so the next words are so hard to write for me, but I am very proud and glad to be writing this whole post on my brand new iPad2, that is definitely far, far above the Android tablets. I love it, against my will but I love it and I now understand you all a bit better.

tl;dr I'm an Android fanboy, I bought a Xoom2, returned it and bought an iPad2 because the Xoom2 was rubbish. I'm really happy of my first Apple product, very sad for Android but still hate iTunes, this won't change.",184,72,2012-01-08,AAPL,0.03685324266552925,0.9147881269454956,0.04835867881774902

apple,Just switched from a Droid X to an iPhone 4s,"And all I've go to say is that I don't think I'll ever switch back.

My first Droid X turned off on it's own one day and simply wouldn't turn back on, I brought it to Verizon and after thirty minutes of ""testing"" they concluded that the phone bricked itself. It was covered under warranty so I went a few days without a phone while I waited for them to send me a new one in the mail. Not ideal, but okay.

Que my second Droid X. Would often reset on it's own, freeze, stutter through apps, the top half of the screen would act as if I was pressing it even when I wasn't, and the GPS never could connect to the satellites.

Brought it in, got the whole ""oh if we factory reset it all the problems will be fixed"" - nope. Was given the ultimatum to pay a $100 deductible to get a third Droid X or use my upgrade + a $50 credit I had (new in two or something, some old promo I was grandfathered into) and get a new phone. Decided to drop the $150 on a 16gb iPhone 4s and HOLY SHIT this phone is fast.

My Droid never worked as well as this, even when it was fresh out of the box with no third party apps. Now I've got a fair amount of music, apps, and pictures and my iPhone takes it all in stride. I'm also amazed at how well Siri works and rarely look through my contacts list to make a phone call now.

Android may be for some people but it'll never be for me. The openness was great but it often caused more problems then it was worth (delayed upgrades, issues with upgrades, apps that wouldn't play well with other apps creating software issues, etc.)

I will however miss my NES Emulator, that was a great time killer.

Here are my games Physics 21 HD and Melon Truck HD. They will be free for a week or so. Here are the direct links to iTunes.

Physics 21 HD: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/physics-21-hd/id474914790?mt=8


Melon Truck HD: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/melon-truck/id431036115?mt=8






**Melon Truck HD**:  Melon Truck Game Play consists of launching objects from a melon truck to baskets that vary in points. Each level must be completed with a minimum score of 1600 in order to proceed to the next locked level. However, Melon Truck offers 6 bonus levels that require gamers to pass all levels with a score of 3000 or better. 

**Physics 21 HD**: Physics 21 HD is a physics based blackjack game for iPhone4, iPod Touch, or iPad2. Gamers have 2 game modes to pick from;

* Timed-Mode; Game play consists of trying to make as many 21's as possible given a short period of time. As players make blackjacks or 21's, they are given more time to play.

* Single-Deck Mode; Players try to get most point by making as many 21's or blackjacks as possible given a single deck.

Gamers will use their finger to shoot cards into baskets to make 21's to gain points and compete against each other in Game Center. 


*Please don't forget to rate in iTunes if you enjoyed playing either game :)*

Thanks,
Batuhan

We have a few basic apps (like PBS Kids, Virtuoso, Music Sparkle), but we're looking for a few more.

She doesn't have strong motor skills, so she isn't able to directly interact with the iPad herself, so we typically hold her hand or finger and move it around to let her tap the screen. She loves bright lights/colors and music. I'm sure there are apps with both in the store, but I have no idea what to look for. As far as prices go, my mom and dad said that up to $10 is okay.

A while back my son found an iPod touch on the road.  We tried, in vain, to find the owner.  It was locked so there was no way to track her down.  The device was named Laura's iPod.  I realized that if Laura had used her home phone number or email address as the name for her device instead of of her first name we could have returned it to her.  At that point I changed the name of my iPhone to my email address.  Cumbersome and not cutsie but practical.  

All that said it all depends on the person who finds it.  I lost my iPhone in the summer and the person who found it was decent enough to answer when I call and return the phone to me.

The trick is this: while in any Apple program (such as Safari or Mail) (and in fact it works with some non-Apple apps as well), in which you have multiple windows open, hold down the Command key and then toggle/tap the the tilde key (the key to the left of the number 1 key, and looks like this: ~ ). This will toggle you through all of the open windows of that particular program.

This is very handy if you happen to be, for instance, working on an email but then need to get back to your main Mail message viewer window. Just hit Command-~ and you will be taken through all open Mail windows. I do this with multiple open Pages docs, Safari windows, and even Excel spreadsheets.",20,73,2012-01-17,AAPL,0.02972710132598877,0.9282915592193604,0.04198136180639267

If you have an extra (older, unused) Mac that is collecting dust, PM me and we can talk price.

iphone,Does iOS 5 keep only a limited amount of SMS messages?!,"So I updated to iOS 5 recently, and I've just discovered that it seems to have deleted old messages (I always keep my messages, so before the update if I scrolled to the beginning of the conversation there would be some texts from early 2011). Suspecting that the phone only keeps a certain amount of messages, I sent a test message to a contact, and sure enough – the first message in the conversation, which definitely was there before I sent the test message, is now gone. I couldn't be bothered to count the exact number of messages still in the list, but it should be around 500.

I'm definitely unhappy with this.

Can anybody confirm this behaviour of iOS 5? And more importantly: Could anyone provide a solution? I know that I can keep backups on my PC, but I'd really like to have all my old messages with me at all times as before – unformatted text isn't even taking up much space, so I really don't understand why Apple did this without any notice.",6,7,2012-01-18,AAPL,0.08409593999385834,0.8889418244361877,0.02696221135556698

AMA,"I currently work at an **Apple Retail Store** in the United States as what is called a ""**Family Room Specialist**."" The role is like a Genius who does nothing but mobile device support (iPhone, iPad, iPod) all day yet gets paid the same as a Red Zone Specialist (the sales grunts).

I've worked for Apple for almost a year and half, and I've seen plenty of crazy sh-t in my day. I've serviced over **6000** devices and had approximately **15,000** total customer interactions. When your home button stops working, you can't figure out iCloud, or that bag of rice just doesn't bring back your phone after you drop it in your beer, I'm the guy you see.

There have been many current/former Genius IAmA's, but I've yet to see one from an FRS. We are like the infantrymen of Apple support. The non-coms to the officers of the Genius role. We have a unique perspective, and a lot of stories to tell therefrom.

**Ask me anything.**

(Proof: The lock screen code on the EasyPay mobile payment/service iPods we use in store was ""1984"" for a while, and changed to ""2001"" last year at the 10th anniversary of Apple Retail.)

apple,One of the positive effects of Apple controlling both the hardware and the software.,"So, back when the Lion GM was released to devs, I blew away both my 2009 Mac Mini and my 2010 MacBook Pro with clean DVD loads (not a fan of upgrades).  Over time, they have understandably accumulated a fair amount of junk, bloat, files, etc and I wanted to give them a clean sweep.  

I used the excuse of buying a new 128GB SSD for my MacBook Pro to perform another clean installation, then spent a couple hours reloading the apps which I felt I used frequently enough, did my tweaks, hacks, updates, etc.  Then, plugged it in (hardwire) and got a nice big fat snapshot on my Leopard Server which hosts all of my TM backups.

When it came time to do the same on the Mini, I had a hell of a lot less which needed to be done.

* Boot to the Lion DVD
* Disk Utility -&gt; Re-partition the boot volume
* Time Machine Restore of laptop snapshot
* Reboot into the brand new clean (and already tweaked) 10.7.2 build
* On the initial boot, I rename the Mini back to it's original name, re-setup Dropbox, purge my 2GB iPhoto Library (I only keep pics on the laptop) and that's it!  I already sync my iTunes content between the two, this was done for me.

Something which I **never** had to worry about, even with going from a laptop to a Mini, was drivers, crashes, etc.  Everything came right up, Lion automatically recognized my dual displays, automatically set them both to 1920x1080, it automatically recognized my BT keyboard and mouse.  In short, I spent 34 minutes restoring a clean build onto my Mini and less than 7 minutes changing a small number of settings.  I think I've spent longer writing this post.

ipad,What do YOU use your iPad for?,My dad got me one for Christmas out of the blue when I had no interest in getting one and quite frankly would rather of had cash towards a new laptop. Since then I probably turned it on 4 or 5 times and I am struggling to see any time when it is beneficial to use it in place of anything. I have an iPhone so the majority of features are redundant - is it literally just a iPod touch with a big screen? I see people on the train and in University with them but I cant believe for a second its more handy then a smartphone be it for productivity or procrastination and as for replacing a laptop its a no go as I need Matlab/Excel/Maple amongst other things. I'm not dissing it in anyway as its clearly a neat but of kit but I'm just wondering where it fits in for you?

Scoreboard Semplice: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scoreboard-semplice/id495596298?mt=8

Differentiating Features:

* Twitter and Facebook time and score-sensitive quick messages.
* Local Notifications to game end.
* Runs perfectly in the background.
* Universal app that runs on all iOS devices (running iOS5) and is optimized for iPad and retina displays.
* I think it looks pretty sweet haha ...

Anyhow, this is my first iOS app, and am having fun seeing how this appstore ecosystem works, so if any of you are interested in a promo code let me know and I'll pm you one. I'll edit this post when they are gone.

Thanks everyone! *Oh, and does anyone see where the Reddit influence came from in the screenshots?* ;)

ipad,Apple insists that I need to pay twice for an app because I moved between countries.,"I purchased Comic Zeal for my iPad in April 2010 when I was temporarily in the US on an extended stay.  Fast forward to yesterday when I tried to re-download the app and was told I'd need to pay for it again.

iTunes support keeps telling me that because I purchased the app on the US Store, I can't download it on the Canada store. But if I try to go to the US store, it won't let me download anything as my address is now in Canada.


Anyone have any suggestions? The easiest thing is probably just for me to jailbreak my ipad and pirate the app that I've already paid for. 

**Edit:** I've discovered that it's about $40 in apps that I'm missing from my time in the US. Also, Apple does not provide phone support for this issue. You cannot get a live person on the line to deal with iTunes billing. Also, to the person downvoting me, mind telling me what you find so offensive about this issue? 

**Edit 2:**  To everyone telling me that I can get 2 accounts for 2 countries: yes, I understand that. The problem is that I have 1 account and I moved. Had I known that it would be this much hassle back in 2010, I would have just created a second account for Canada.  
  
The issue has been resolved. Here is what happened: I can still download the app for free, but it *looks* like I'm going to purchase it. I need to confirm a purchase with the green 'buy app' button and enter my password. Only then does it say that I've already purchased this app and it'll be downloaded for free. This only happens with apps that I purchased in the US store. Apps I have purchased in the Canadian store show up under my 'purchased' section in the App Store. 
  
The iTunes support rep was completely wrong in telling me that I would need to re-purchase the app again. It took an escalation to a supervisor for me to get a solution that 1st level support should know. I also find it aggravating that you cannot call into Apple for billing issues. The big sell for Apple is supposed to be excellent support. I think they really dropped the ball today with my issue.",17,73,2012-01-30,AAPL,0.05378167703747749,0.9138622283935547,0.0323561392724514

Simply pulling out a USB drive I had plugged in immediately made the bar start moving again and the restore completed in the usual couple of minutes.",6,33,2012-01-30,AAPL,0.040855102241039276,0.8755069971084595,0.08363793790340424

Changes (as far as I can tell)

* Completely [redesigned](http://i.imgur.com/gOVPh.png) interface (now looks exactly like AirPort Utility iOS app)
* Back to My Mac support via iCloud (e.g. accessing your Time Machine via BTMM)
* No longer support [dynamic global hostname](http://dyn.com/support/airport-time-capsule-with-dynamic-dns/). 

Apart from that, I've found that my Mac is able to connect to Time Capsule's 5GHz network now (rather than 2.4GHz, previously it won't work unless I separate 5GHz into another network.)

BTMM via iCloud alone is worth it.",46,26,2012-01-30,AAPL,0.017992395907640457,0.9156139492988586,0.06639356911182404
