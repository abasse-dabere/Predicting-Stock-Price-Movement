mac,Just converted to Mac.,"I just purchased a 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro and I'm about to go pick it up in a couple of minutes from the store. I got the bare bones edition because I am just going to be using it for school work that isn't too CPU or GPU intensive (I have my gaming rig for that anyways).

iphone,"Introducing Reddme, a new way to browse Reddit on your iPhone. Coming soon.","This is a post my team and I at dotTouch Apps (http://twitter.com/dottouch) have been waiting to make for a very long time. Reddit clients are abundant in the App Store, and it doesn’t take long to find a very good client for day to day usage. Many of these clients share similar elements, both visually or experience wise, but often end up leaning the experience to either powerful but difficult to use, or easy to use but not that powerful. While designing Reddme, we aimed to bridge the gap between smart and simple and create a Reddit app that is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally pleasing. We think you’ll like the result. Reddme comes packed with tons of features, all of which can be found on our website (http://reddmeapp.com).


We're also looking for beta testers, we're releasing very soon and would appreciate heavy Reddit users. If you have multiple iOS 7 devices, use Reddit heavily day to day, shoot me an email at kyle@dottouchapps.com. 

EDIT: The response to the beta has been crazy, beyond what we expected. Spots are mostly filled (I really wanted to accept everyone since you guys were so awesome, I'll be up at night feeling bad about this) but if you have any more questions, would like to see parts of the app or anything else, feel free to email me!",48,64,2014-02-02,AAPL,0.02003251574933529,0.922584593296051,0.05738285928964615

apple,Time Machine Saved my Thesis,"There's absolutely no reason for me to post this anywhere, except I'm so immensely grateful at the moment that I have to express myself somewhere. For as much bitching as I and others have been doing recently about certain issues with Mavericks (no XP printer share support) and things like the new iWords suite (still now way to look at page layout in Numbers), my OSX system literally just saved me from the depths of despair and reminded me of why I use Apple products.

I'm working on my master's thesis in biochemistry, which has become a mammoth document currently hovering around 12,000 words and 66 pages. I'm using Word for Mac to write it, because I need to collaborate extensively with others and can't risk conversion issues. Well, Word for Mac apparently has a bug with really large documents where trying to switch a paragraph style can cause the whole thing to crash. I had been saving regularly, but I received one of those crashes after lunch today. For some reason, when it restored, it restored to a version from yesterday, losing about 1,000 words of text and countless contextual and formatting revisions. 

I nearly threw my computer, but walked around for a bit instead. When I got back, I decided to try to check and see if I could use that cool revision history feature of Time Machine (which I had never had the need to do before). Well, lo and behold, my machine had done a backup using Power Nap while I was away at lunch, and I only ended up losing about two lines of text overall. I've never been so grateful for my habit of plugging in my external hard drive every day when I get to the lab.

Anyway, that's my story. If you don't use Time Machine, you should consider it. Also, it would be nice if Word would autosave properly.

iphone,The OPTIMAL wallpaper size for the iPhone 5/5c/5s is 744x1392.,"This is something I've wondered about for several months, and I just got around to researching it.

As we all know, iOS 7 scales background images up to make extra room on the edges for the parallax effect. Although the iPhone 5s's screen size is 640x1136, a 640 by 1136 pixel wallpaper will actually be blown up by a few percent, resulting in scaling artifacts, making backgrounds less sharp than the retina display is capable of displaying. Likewise, very large images will actually be scaled down, again resulting in scaling artifacts. For a while it was unclear what exact image size would actually be untouched by the iPhone's parallax wallpaper scaling algorithms.

I created a 1x1 pixel grid at the size of 744x1392. I set this image as a background on my iPhone 5s (with reduce motion turned off). I then took my iPhone to a microscope. Without moving the device, the exact black and white pixel grid was exactly reproduced, 1-to-1 on the retina display. This is proof that the iPhone 5s's native/optimal parallax wallpaper size is 744x1392. Wallpapers at this exact resolution will not be scaled. Hope this helps someone! :)

Here's the pixel grid I used. Try it for yourself! http://i.imgur.com/WlqzCfO.png

Interestingly, setting this as your background causes artifacts as you move the iPhone to create the parallax effect. I think this is because as the iPhone is moving the background across pixel boundaries, it tries to resample it. The screen flickers quite a bit as you rotate the iPhone. Setting this image as someone's wallpaper could be a nice prank :D",17,62,2014-02-08,AAPL,0.046413399279117584,0.9164817929267883,0.03710481524467468

apple,PSA: Quicktime X and Quicklook now only natively support H.264 and ProRes video files,"After a long hard look at why my workflow got disrupted under Mavericks, I finally found Apple's response. They've dropped support for all codecs except H.264 and ProRes within Quicktime X and Quicklook. If you want to open ANY other video file, Quicktime X must convert it to either ProRes or H.264 first. This is a major annoyance to all video production people I know and a huge step back in Quicktime's functionality.

I posted this yesterday although a lot of you disagreed with the tone of the post and took my criticism of Apple's decision as though I was blaspheming some kind of deity. I use my computer to earn a living

This post serves as a PSA, as this ""feature"" wasn't advertised anywhere.

A lot of people on this subreddit don't work with video so won't see any change, but for those of us who do - we may need to rethink the tools we use.

If you work with video, know this before you upgrade to Mavericks. Even if you use another program to open or browse your footage, QuickLook still won't work. It's a frustrating and bizarre decision to drop all other codecs on the OS of choice for the video &amp; film industry.

The codecs they dropped aren't old or legacy. They're still very much in use within production environments today.

Perian won't work.

Solutions:

* Roll back to a previous OS
* Use an older version of Quicktime (or VLC) to open your files. While valid, this doesn't re-enable QuickLook functionality in Finder and doesn't have the same OS integration/benefits of Quicktime.

apple,Blown away by guys at Apple store tonight.,"We all hear about those ""Apple moments"" and being blown away by their customer service, but tonight it happened to me.

A few weeks back I dropped my MacBook Pro Retina. I bent the corner and cracked the screen. My heart sunk, and honestly, I've remained depressed about it for the past few weeks. I checked with my homeowners and credit card company trying to figure out how to see if I could get some help. After those led to nothing I figured I would just settle for me being dumb, take the loss, and just stay depressed about how I wasted $1200 and broke something I loved.

I even had my wife hide it, because it broke my heart every time I looked at it. 

Well, I was putting some stuff on eBay today, and thought I would break it out, take some pics, and sell it for parts - maybe someone else could fix it and enjoy it. When it came time to list it, I just couldn't do it. I heard it would be a lot to fix, but I told my wife, ""You know what, I'll make a Genius Bar appointment just to see how much it really is. If I think I can get it fixed without breaking the bank, I'll do it."" She knew how much it meant to me and agreed.

My appointment was for 5:30, and I arrived to a REALLY busy store. I was even more ready to get it repaired after seeing people owning their new Macs and iPads. I was checked in, and waiting when a Genius (I don't know if I should give names... ) came up and asked for some details of what happened. I told him the story which boils down to: I had the laptop for about a month, when it fell, snagging on my clothes when letting the dog out. Totally my fault, I was sick about it, and wanted to get it repaired. He told me to ""Hold on a second,"" and walked away with my laptop.

He came back with his manager and said, ""Sir, it seems like I might have dropped your laptop when checking it out, I'm afraid we'll have to replace it with a new one if it's OK with you."" (edit2: To be clear, they were both smiling and this was just being nice - there was no real deception going on. I would not LET an employee lie for me, if it were in a ""serious"" manner). My jaw dropped and I was floored. I felt like I was in a commercial or on candid camera. To his word, he wiped my old one (I keep backups of everything in the cloud), and handed me a brand new one, including an extra charger - he said he didn't need the one from the box.

It's a good strategy. I'm the goto person to a LOT of people when it comes to computer advice. I've been leaning toward Apple for years, but now solidly on their side forever. I honestly do love the products anyway, but I'm no longer an advocate, but evangelist.

This all may seem old hat to /r/apple, but this type of customer service is new to me. I hugged the Genius on the way out.

Edit: The ""lie"" was just flair... some people are misunderstanding that, I think. Everyone was aware of what really happened. Also, this was combination of a very nice Apple employees and Apple giving me the leeway to take care of me. This doesn't happen for everyone, which is obvious in the comments, so I know how lucky I am.",374,1562,2014-02-18,AAPL,0.06892910599708557,0.8939231634140015,0.03714775666594505

apple,Thanks Apple community. Here are 50 promo codes for my Mac and iOS apps,"Five years ago, I taught myself to program and built an app to help me manage my bills. It wasn't very good, but I got lots of feedback, and eventually the app got much better.

Two years ago, I was able to quit my job and work on my app full time. I owe a ton to the Apple community of users who have bought my app, provided feedback, taken the time to write positive reviews, etc. It's awesome to hear that an app I built originally for my own use is benefitting other people. Plus, being able to work from home &amp;amp; spend more time with my son, is amazing. I love it.

Today, as far as I know, my app is the only bill management app that is available for Mac, iPhone and iPad that syncs with iCloud. I've still got lots of improvements planned, but I am proud of it.

I wanted to say thank you to the community for making this possible, so here are 50 promo codes for the Mac version of my bill management app, [Chronicle](http://www.chronicleapp.com), and 50 promo codes for the iOS version too (they sync via iCloud).

Some of the features include:

*  A new unique UI (first iOS Reddit client to have a card-layout).
* Quickly browse the Front Page of Internet. Sort the posts by various sort options supported by Reddit.
- Post to Reddit.
- Reply to a topic and other users' post.
- Vote posts and other users' comments.

apple,Be careful relying on Time Machine backups in Mavericks. Story inside.,"There's not a whole lot of documentation out there on this yet, but some is starting to pop up. Apple is aware of the issue and has an internal support note for the geniuses, but nothing public.

I've been using a Time Capsule to back up two computers (me and my wife) for about 4 years. Up until this point everything has worked fine and dandy. Last week, Safari got messed up on my iMac so I decided to do a fresh install of Mavericks and restore my data from my latest Time Machine backup, which I did right before doing the erase.

After doing the clean install, I went to 'Restore from a Time Machine backup' in the boot menu. In here, I found that none of my latest backups were showing up. The last one that was in there was from October 24th, the day before I installed Mavericks. 

I booted to the fresh OS without doing a restore and entered Time Machine. All of my data was there; I could access single files both through the 'Star Wars' view and by mounting the sparse bundle. However, Migration Assistant would not work on anything after October 24th. After some digging I realized that in the pre-Mavericks backups everything was in the sparse bundle; documents, music, Library folders, Applications, etc. Post-Mavericks, no Library or Applications information was being backed up, only data. I presume that this is why I couldn't restore to those.

I decided to cut my losses and restore to Oct 24 and then transfer my newer data over manually from the spare bundle. I opened the boot menu and it wouldn't even let me restore to the ones pre-Mavericks! It sat and searched for disks to install on and never found them. I even tried installing Mountain Lion, and it still wouldn't work.

In the end, I ended up with a clean copy of Mavericks. I manually dragged all of my data over from the sparse bundle, reset all of my preferences, reinstalled all of my programs. I spent 6 hours at the Apple Store and had them completely stumped. They escalated it to Apple Tier 2 in Cupertino, but I haven't heard back.

Anyway, just be careful. Maybe try booting to that menu and going to 'restore from a Time Machine backup' and see if yours show up. You're not going to lose your data, but you may lose a day of completely redoing your computer. Be careful having blind faith in Time Machine like I did.",22,43,2014-02-22,AAPL,0.045055363327264786,0.9180934429168701,0.036851175129413605

* [Clean fit!](http://i.imgur.com/7w42kVn.jpg)

Today I cloned my HDD over to a Crucial M500 128 GB SSD and installed it in my 15"" 2010 MBP, 2.4 GHz. Here are some time trials I've recorded, all rounded up to the nearest second, and averaged over two runs each:

**Booting from cold:**

* (HDD) Time to 'bwaam': 6 seconds.
* (SSD) Time to 'bwaam': 6 seconds.
* (HDD) Time to reach login screen: 58 seconds.
* (SSD) Time to reach login screen: 50 seconds.
* (HDD) Time to reach desktop (paused when inputting password): 1 minute 41 seconds. edit: this is total time
* (SSD) Time to reach desktop (paused when inputting password): 55 seconds. edit: this is total time. I'm aware this could be shorter, you can stop pointing that out. I only boot once a month or so, this doesn't bother me at all and I'm not doing anything about it until the summer. 

**Photoshop Elements 9:**

* (HDD) Time for icon to stop 'jumping': 14 seconds.
* (SSD) Time for icon to stop 'jumping': &amp;amp;lt; 2 seconds.
* (HDD) Time to fully open and re-open the last image: 33 seconds.
* (SSD) Time to fully open and re-open the last image: 4 seconds.

**Microsoft Word:**

* (HDD) Time for icon to stop 'jumping': 6 seconds.
* (SSD) Time for icon to stop 'jumping': &amp;amp;lt; 2 seconds.
* (HDD) Time to fully open and load the first page of templates: 44 seconds.
* (SSD) Time to fully open and load the first page of templates: 16 seconds.

**FTL: Faster Than Light:**

* (HDD) Time to load to main menu: 12 seconds.
* (SSD) Time to load to main menu: 11 seconds. 

Booting time was pleasantly improved. I rarely shut down, but when I did, it was a pain, so this is nice. I haven't timed waking from sleep since that was already pretty snappy before. Word loads noticably faster when a document is being re-opened, but I didn't time it beforehand. It's about 8-10 seconds now depending on the .doc size. I didn't expect much difference with FTL at all, so that wasn't surprising. The game is very small and light-loading on the GPU. The biggest surprise was PSE9 - 33 seconds down to 4! Insane!

apple,The iOS Music app needs a dramatic overhaul,"There has been a lot of commotion about the iOS 7 music app and how it's difficult to use because of how albums are listed and because everything requires far more scrolling than it did in iOS 6, but I believe that the Music app's problems are far deeper and more significant than this.

**Here's the problem, as I see it, and how I propose that it can be fixed:**

Think about how we select our music today. It's a series of nested folders. You select one of a few different categories (Artists, Songs, Genres etc...) and within that category, you select another folder (ie. within Genres, you select the artist) and finally, you select the file you want.

This is the same basic structure we've been using since the dawn of MP3 players well over a decade ago. It's static, doesn't leave much room for customization, and it's extremely limiting. Visuals have improved and we've gotten a few new features here and there (like Smart Playlists and Genius), but **the basic method of music selection today is exactly the same as it was on the very first iPod in 2001**, and it's starting to feel downright ancient. That needs to change.

**Music needs tags.** That's the solution to this problem. Instead of simply descending down through these static folder trees like we still do today, we need a more dynamic UX. I want to be able to apply multiple tags to any given song/album/artist, so that when I'm in the mood for an upbeat, long, indie song, I can select 'upbeat', 'long', and 'indie', and it will automatically populate a playlist of all music in my library that has those three tags. Or if I feel like listening to acoustic rock instrumentals, anything tagged with 'acoustic', 'rock', and 'instrumental' in my entire music library will automatically be thrown together in a playlist. And star ratings should be included in this as well, so that I can automatically listen to  all 5-star acoustic rock instrumentals.

Smart playlists allow you to to create playlists based on many criteria, but these are still static playlists that need to be created in advance. What the Music App needs is this type of functionality *on the fly*, and that's exactly what introducing tags will do.

Aside from that, there are two other improvements that the music app really could use:

1. **An easier way to transition between playlists.** For example, let's say I don't know what to listen to, so I just throw on a random playlist. While listening to that playlist, 'Money' by Pink Floyd starts playing and suddenly I realize that I want to listen to more Pink Floyd, or I want to listen to Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. There's currently no way to do this. I have to go into the Artists tab, select Pink Floyd, and then start playing the album. Yes, iOS 7 introduced the Album/Playlist tabs within the 'Now Playing' screen, but there's no way to smoothly transition from one to the other. There needs to be a way to transition from your current playlist into an album without having to interrupt anything.

2. **Up Next.** Many have mentioned this already, so I won't repeat what's already been said, but this song queueing functionality was introduced in iTunes last year and it's long overdue for an appearance in iOS.


**Those are the three major changes that I firmly believe the Music app needs. It's time for Apple to push the process of music selection to the next level.**",127,143,2014-02-25,AAPL,0.028605615720152855,0.9292600750923157,0.042134325951337814

My story begins with a MBP 13"" mid 2010 I've had for a few years now as a backup laptop. It was a trusty old warrior of mine that finally gave way recently.

I spent the first two days spending over 20 hours doing EVERYTHING availble online to get it working. to no avail.

I then call Apple Support. I have always heard good things about them but never really experienced it. I fix my own stuff so that is to be expected.
 
But alas, finally my poor MBP no longer worked, and it was time.
 
Called them the night before. I was about 3 years out of warranty but one word about my problem with installing the OS and BOOM, no fee required. He didn't even mention a fee, just one word about it and we went onto step 2 to a hundred in troubleshooting. I spent 40 m talking with the helpful gentleman. But again, Alas, every tip he recommended, I had already done as I googled the **** out of everything.
 
I finally relented and asked to order my specific laptops original restore disk. I left it at home and heard that Apple replaces it for free but charges a S&amp;H fee and it will take a week. Whatever. I ask for it, HE tells me that there will be no charge, and then guess what?
