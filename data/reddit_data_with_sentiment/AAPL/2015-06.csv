iphone,"How is a broken, flawed, one-star rated app topping the charts right now?","Right now, the top rated free app on the app store is called ""Like Parent"". You take a picture of your parents and yourself, and it will supposedly tell you who you resemble more. Except in the description, it says it is a fake joke and doesn't work.  Take a look for yourself.  
How does an app that a developer spent 5 minutes on (which generates fake percentages), is rated one star by most users, and is basically crap, reach the top of the App Store charts?  With advertisements, this developer is making an incredible amount of money by exploiting the app store.  How does apple just let this happen?

apple,I think we're underestimating this Apple TV upgrade.,"I think we should expect a major hardware (and price) upgrade to the Apple TV - something along the lines of early iPhones + appropriate ports. Proper internals for running apps directly on AppleTV hardware, which I don't think it's capable of doing at the moment, would be huge. ""Apps"" are currently just disguised links to a web service as far as I can tell. (which is why the Keynote channel pops up when needed)
  
With proper hardware, an upgraded Apple TV could essentially replace a variety of different low spec hardware devices in your home. Bridges (for connected devices), alarm systems, casual gaming consoles right through to cable/satellite decoders.  
  
I feel we're massively underestimating the effect this Apple TV is going to make to the world. Something as simple as our idea of a TV channel is going to change dramatically. The Apple TC SDK will do for independent content producers what the app store did for individual, man-on-the-street, developers. 
  
I would say the new Apple TV will be one of the most important launches ever, or at least I hope it will. Exciting times.",83,126,2015-06-03,AAPL,0.013600688427686691,0.9028840065002441,0.08351530879735947

apple,Apple's Global Security Division called me today,"So awhile back ago, my aunt was hit with one of those pop ups that wanted her to call an unknown tech support number to fix her Mac of malware. She called me wanting me to figure out what was going on. Checked her computer and nothing was going on, recorded some information as well as the phone number. Told her she was fine and helped her clear it.

The next day, I prepped a Virtual Machine with OS X and called this number I recorded and called it via Skype. I also had Wireshark active and watching the machine's traffic. The technician wanted access to the computer as a part of the scam. I let him onto the machine and took control. He opened Terminal and showed me harmless processes he deemed ""malicious"" and wanted $500 to fix it. I told him that I wasn't going to do it, knew it was a scam and hung up. 

I had his IP address and obtained some information through a Who.Is query. After this happened, I e-mailed Tim Cook on 5/28 telling him of this going around, how it's affecting Mac users, as well as how they are impersonating Apple technicians. I also left contact information in the event that they want to get in touch about it.

This afternoon around 4pm CDT driving home from work, I got a call from a number based in San Jose. I picked it up and on the other end was Licha from Apple's Global Security Division. She said that she was calling on behalf of Mr. Cook who has read my e-mail and forwarded it to her. We spoke about the matter and I asked her if I could e-mail the findings I had to their division as I had records on my laptop. She said that would be perfect and contacted me via e-mail. I sent Apple the details and general information on this issue.

This is why I love Apple and have even more respect for Tim Cook. This is definitely a clear indication that they want their customers protected.

apple,Monthly APPreciation Thread for June 2015,"Here's this month's App recommendation thread. What apps have you been enjoying for the past month?
*****
**Guidelines**  

* Try to feature apps that people may not have heard of.  
* **One app per comment.**
* Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS and OS X are both game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a sentence or two, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.
* Don't mention native/built-in apps (Reminders, Mail, etc) because everyone knows about them.

apple,"Emailed Tim Cook, Apple's a pretty solid company","About two weeks ago, my iPhone 5's sleep/wake button stopped working so I took it into the Apple Store because I looked up the serial number, and I knew that Apple would fix the problem for free. 

After turning my iPhone in, I received an email a few days later informing me that my phone was ""broken"" and suffering from ""delamination"" issues, and that I'd have to pay $269 to get it fixed. 

I'm a college student with a five figure debt, but I can't really function without a phone, so I was faced with either paying for it, or using a broken phone for a while. 

When I turned my phone in, it was perfectly functional, and the only observable issue was the sleep/wake button. 

Lost, I sent an email to Mr. Tim Cook. I told him how I was stuck, and I was hoping that he could perhaps help with my issue. 

I thought there was a chance that he'd see it, and maybe something could happen. 

A day later,  I got a phone call from Apple HQ (I didn't include my phone number... they got it anyways), and a very kind and professional gentleman was on the other side, informed me that he was calling on behalf of Mr. Cook, that he'd look into the issue, and make sure the problem was resolved.

Long story short, Apple replaced my phone with a brand new iPhone 5 completely free. 

This was never the goal, I simply wanted to vent a little, and I'd obviously end up paying for them fixing my phone. 

But instead I got a brand new phone, never been used. 

Apple's a massive company, they don't have to help individuals like me with my petty personal problems, but I think it speaks highly of their culture when they do something like this. 

Kudos Mr. Cook, you've got yourself a great company.",68,247,2015-06-05,AAPL,0.09602167457342148,0.8727549314498901,0.03122338466346264

mac,"As a windows user for 15+ years, the Macbook Pro 15"" has been one of my best purchases yet. I don't regret switching at all!","Last week I bought the Macbook Pro 15"" with a 2.5 Ghz Intel CPU, 512 GB, and 370x GPU. It costed me about $2,500, and really, I do not regret spending $2,000+ dollars on this laptop. 

At first, I was reluctant to purchase the macbook because why should I plop $2,000+ dollars on a laptop when I can get an even better laptop with 10x better the specs. Then I realized, I won't really need the extra horsepower when I'll mostly be using my laptop for schoolwork, browsing the internet, occasional gaming, and socializing over skype. And in my opinion, the Mac is no doubt the best laptop for those options listed above. People who complain about the price on the mac don't realize that this piece of machine isn't intended for gaming or haven't even used a mac for at least a week! My experience so far on the mac has been splendid and I wouldn't mind at all spending $3,000 dollars in the future for Apples future laptops.

**What I Love About the Macbook**
The screen.. my god the screen is gorgeous. I swear, once you read on this screen, you can never go back to any other laptop. It's just so crisp and clear, it makes other laptop screens look like an old CRT monitor found at a thrift shop.

It just works. I haven't experienced one slowdown or one error my whole week. 

The OS is clean and fresh and heck. It's so nice looking at a clean desktop.

I don't know if this applies to some people, but to me the Mac has made me more productive. I don't know why. It may be how the computer looks, how clean it is, how many apps come pre-installed on the mac, but it just makes me work more.

THE TRACKPAD. Hands down, this is the best track pad in the world. No argument. It's so smooth and easy to glide my hand on, and the hand gestures make it even more better.

The keyboard! I know there are some keyboards that feel similar to the mac keyboard, but this is probably one of the best laptop keyboards I've ever used.

Well, I just wanted to rant on how much I love Macs and how great they are. I got even more reasons why I love them, but it's night time! Anyhow I want to thank this subreddit for it's help and information, and how greatly built these laptops are from top to bottom. Never can I go to windows again after using the mac...",86,140,2015-06-05,AAPL,0.03923146054148674,0.91867995262146,0.04208860918879509

apple,I hope that Apple has better syncing capabilities in iOS 9 and the new OS.,"I would love for the synching to work across all devices as Apple claims. For instance I place an event on my desktop calendar the event may or may not show up on my iPad or iPhone for a few hours or not at all.
I take a pic on my iPhone and the pic may or may not show up for hours on my desktop photo stream and same thing goes for my iPad. How can I trust Apple with storing things in iCloud when simple things such as syncing isn't working properly?
I switched to Evernote for my main note taking application because when I was using the notes app in my iPhone they would sometimes synch on my desktop and iPad and other times not at all. One time all my notes on my iPhone inexplicably disappeared but where still on my iPad and desktop. 
Meanwhile the new Google Photo app puts Apple's attempt to shame. As soon as I take a photo on my iPhone it appears instantaneously on my desktop and iPad. I have yet to experience this in synching across devices using stock Apple apps.

apple,Apple wants me to pay $100 to continue publishing my (free) Safari extension (Reddit Enhancement Suite),"**MEGA EDIT:** Please read before asking questions, as most things people asking me are repeats:

**Q:** Can't you just distribute the extension yourself?

**A:** I already do. However, it seems from Apple's email to all Safari extension developers that we must pay to continue supporting our extensions and providing updates. A couple of users have linked to articles that give confusing information about whether or not this is really the case. [here is one of them](http://www.cio.com/article/2933693/apple-now-charges-safari-extension-developers-for-distribution.html), which confusingly states that the developer of a popular extension will pay the fee ""to ensure that his extension will still be available for El Capitan users.""

From [another article](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2933692/apple-now-charges-safari-extension-developers-for-distribution.html), it seems that perhaps I could still ""release"" RES on my own without paying apple - but auto update functionality would go away. This is pretty much a dealbreaker for any browser extension that interacts with a website, as websites change somewhat often, and a developer definitely can't count on people to update their extensions manually.

If in fact this is all a result of a poorly worded email, then I will be thrilled that all Apple is ""guilty of"" here is doing a crappy job with the email they sent me. Here's the relevant text of Apple's email to me which leads me to believe I must pay the fee to continue giving people updates to RES:

&gt; You can continue building Safari extensions and bring your creativity to other Apple platforms by joining the Apple Developer Program. Join today to provide updates to your current extensions, build new extensions, and submit your extensions to the new Safari Extensions Gallery for OS X El Capitan.

(joining the program is what costs $100 per year)

---

**Q:** It's to keep spammers out, idiot.

**A:** That's not really a question. Also, there's no real evidence that that's why they're doing this. Furthermore, it's worth way more than $100 to get malware/spam installed into many users' browsers. $100 isn't much of a deterrent. I don't think that's really the reason. It seems the real reason is just that they've consolidated their 3 separate developer programs (iOS / OSX / Safari Extensions) for simplicity's sake, but not properly thought about how that might upset / affect people who were only interested in building Safari Extensions (which was previously free) and not the other two.

---

**Q:** You can't come up with $100? What are you poor or something?

**A:** I'm far less concerned about my own ability to come up with $100 than I am about developers in general being shut out from the system over this. Not everyone has the user base that RES has.  

---

**Q:** But you get a lot of stuff for that $100 per year. What are you complaining about?

**A:** Safari (on Desktop) is a browser with just 5% market share, and paying $100 just to build extensions for it doesn't seem wise, especially when people expect extensions to be free.  Apple announced Swift was open source, and then makes this move that I feel hurts open source developers.  Sure, the iOS SDK and Xcode are great, and probably worth $100 -- but only to people who are going to develop iOS or OSX applications. I'm not, so those have no value to me.

---

**Q:** Why do you think Apple is doing this? Do you really think they're trying to hurt extension devs?

**A:** I honestly think they just didn't think about it too much. I think they made a business decision to consolidate their developer programs - one that generally makes sense - and it didn't occur to them that people who are *only* developing extensions might be upset about this.  That, or the articles above are correct and the email I got was just misleading / poorly written.

---

**Q:** If I give you $100 does this problem go away?

**A:** My goal here, although I very much appreciate people's generous offers to help pay for it, is to raise awareness and hopefully get more open source developers to [**politely** provide feedback to Apple](https://developer.apple.com/contact/) that this policy is not OK.  Sure I could pay for it with donations you guys give me - but then other open source developers who haven't yet gained a following that will help pay are still walled out by this $100 fee.

If you're not a developer but still want to give *polite* feedback from the perspective of a user, [here's the general safari feedback page](https://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html) 


The original post:

-----

So it used to be free to be a part of the Safari developer program. That's being folded into Apple's dev program now, and I'm required to pay $100 to join if I want to continue publishing Reddit Enhancement Suite - which is free.

$100 would be several months worth of donations, on many/most months, and only to support less than 1% of RES users (as in, Safari makes somewhere around 1%).

Not only is the cost an annoyance, I also don't feel Apple deserves $100 from me just so I can have the privilege of continuing to publish *free* software that enhances its browsers.  They're not providing a value add here (e.g. the iOS SDK, etc) that justifies charging us money.  

To be clear: RES isn't published on their extension gallery, so the $100 being allocated to their ""review process"" isn't really valid either. In addition, spammers / malicious extension developers have a lot more than $100 to gain from publishing scammy apps.  My Safari developer certificate is already linked / provided through my iTunes account ID (and therefore credit card etc), so it's not like the $100 gets them ""more confirmation"" that I am who I say I am.

I don't know what I'm going to do yet, but worst case scenario I will try my best to get one more release out before the deadline screws me (and therefore you, if you use Safari/RES) over.",1298,5909,2015-06-09,AAPL,0.047367628663778305,0.9180143475532532,0.034618012607097626

apple,Apple's new Safari extension policy: $100/year to continue publishing uBlock,"**Edit:** thanks to a very generous donation from /u/mbrochh, uBlock is now covered for a year of Developer Program membership. Thank you.

I'd like to emphasize that what follows remains to hold — this isn't an issue exclusive to a couple of extensions, and the smaller, less popular extensions are likely to be more hurt by the policy.

---

Hi!

I'm Chris. I develop [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org/), a blocker extension designed to be lightweight and efficient. It's available for Safari among other browsers.

I just learned about Apple's new (upcoming) policy for Safari extensions. One will not be able to distribute (or update) them without going through Apple's extension gallery, which requires a developer membership.

I think it's pretty ridiculous that Apple is:

* revoking the ability to serve extensions directly to users
* **and** requiring a *paid* membership to distribute through them

This obviously affects all Safari extensions (I just read the post by the RES developer).

Like RES, [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org/) is free and open-source. While the money is indeed an issue (I just can't figure out how to get the amount for the yearly fee), it's not why I'm writing this per se.

---

This is to share another example, just in case it potentially helps an attempt at influencing Apple's policy.

Extension developers *add* value to the ecosystem, and Apple wants to charge for that? A **net negative** for the developers?

---

*Apple:* I get why it makes sense to charge for developer membership for, say, iOS. The App Store is inherently monetizable — there's even a certain expectation of that in general. Apps are often paid, are ad-supported, or have IAPs, etc.

But browser extensions aren't.

---

P.S.:

If I had the money, I'd pay it out of pocket in an instant — and I'll be doing my best to figure out a way to do that, to keep uBlock for Safari available and free. I personally feel a certain responsibility towards the user-base.

Thanks,

— Chris.

apple,iOS 9: still no Calculator and Weather apps on iPad,"The lack of these basic apps built into iOS: a dedicated Dictionary app on both iPhone and iPad as is on OS X (in addition to the contextual one). And the iPhone's Calculator and Weather apps built into iPad.

Why do we need to download apps to perform such basics tasks? Weather and Calculator are too basic of functions to leave to a third party to solve and not include in iPad OS out of the box. I shouldn't need to type a word in notes to contextually look up the definition if I'm not in a Siri-appropriate environment. 5 years on for iPad and 8 years on for Dictionary we're still lacking these basic functions.

If they think it forces people to try the App Store I think that's a terrible reason for 1: people are going to use the App Store anyway and 2: these functions are too basic to leave out of the default OS and 3: it needlessly worsens the iOS experience over where it should be.

No doubt Apple debates this internally, but I believe the side winning this argument are wrong.

EDIT: I'm pretty surprised at the response to this! I think the biggest factor in the survivability of these laptops (aside from the construction...) is the fact that they could be upgraded (quite a bit) for relatively low cost. In that respect, it's kind of disappointing to see the new laptops heading away from that.

apple,Impressions of El Capitan on an older Mac,"Hi!  I installed El Capitan on my horribly abused 2010 11"" Macbook Air, with a broken USB port, dented screen, and terrible self-esteem.  The one that was underpowered on day 1, yet somehow still good enough to do anything 5 years later (I just edited a feature film scene on it yesterday).  I will stop using this computer only when it or I die, and judging by it's durability so far, I'm betting on the latter.   You can read comprehensive impressions on 10.11 anywhere, but here are my thoughts  specifically on how it's making my aging runt Mac relevant again.

- Nope, I don't get Metal (nVidia 320m, Metal requires at least 400 series).  Previously, I had to disable transparency in Yosemite to get anywhere near acceptable performance.  Even without Metal support, El Capitan UI rendering performance flies.  Seriously, it's like a new computer.

- I reclaimed 10GB of precious space on my 128GB drive just by installing.

- I can auto-hide the menu bar.  On a 768px height screen, for Lightroom and other apps, those ~20 pixels are gold.  

- The San Francisco font makes the UI infinitely more legible.  Let's be honest, the 1366x768 screen deserves to be on a netbook.  The new font in 10.11 makes a big difference.  If I squint enough, even on small fonts now, I can trick myself into thinking I'm on one of them fancy new retina Macintoshes. 

- All of my apps are compatible with no problems.  Even system-level ones like Boom.

- Redesigned beachball.  I've spent so much time looking at this little guy, I wanted to see his new makeover.  Despite my best efforts, I couldn't even get him to appear in 10.11 - until I opened Chrome, of course!  Lookin' good, lil buddy.

- 30min more battery life.  I've never replaced the now 5-year-old battery, yet I'm now getting 4 hours average on this beta.  I bet this will get even better once all the error reporting is removed for the final.

So, overall, even if your old computer doesn't make the cut for Metal, and you've secretly had the 13"" rMBP in your shopping cart for a few weeks now like I do, you have a lot to look forward to.

iphone,[UPDATE] Traded my iPhone 6 for a 6 Plus on Craigslist and buyer claims the battery is faulty and I scammed him.,"So that was an experience.
Due to the ridiculous nature of what really happened, I feel like you guys might be interested in the story.

**---**


Slightly long story but I feel like context helps; I traded my iPhone 6 and some cash to this college student for his iPhone 6 plus. He inspects it while mentioning how he had an iPhone 6 but he had a chance to trade it for a 6 plus, but that it turned out to be way too big for him and now he wanted a 6 again. At this point I should've seen what follows coming.


So he spends 1 hour and 45 minutes testing the phone, prodding, pushing, shaking, clicking, plugging, unplugging my iPhone 6. I just quickly checked the IMEI online and inspected the phone physically, was done in 2 minutes, meanwhile I'm answering all his ridiculous questions ""Woah why does it do this, why that"" I tell him the phone's jailbroken and I didn't want to lose the jailbreak if the trade didn't go down, but that I'd restore it right then and there or leave it if he wished. He tells me ""Wow, no I don't wanna mess with this stuff, don't you have to be really smart to do these things?"" No, you just have to not be an idiot. Anyway, after going back and forth with himself ""I dunno-I dunno-I dunno! I'm gonna miss the battery life on this baby"" he kept saying over and over.


Eventually he said ""Alright yeah I'll take it."" At which point I restored the phone, handed him 100 bucks, gifted him my old case (which I never used) and sent him on his way. Before leaving, he asked ""If I find any problem with this phone, do you think we can just trade back?"" I said sure, if that applied to me as well, and we agreed to keep our respective phone receipts in case something went awry. I should have never said that.


So then, less than 30 hours later I get a phone call at 9:30 PM. Note that nobody but my S.O. or family calls me at this time on a Monday night. He tells me this very hurriedly and shakily as soon as I pick up: ""Hey umm how should we- the phone has a really short battery like I get 5 hours, that's less than my girl's iPhone 5, I already checked with a lot of other iPhone 6s and my girl's 5 what uh.. what how should we handle this?"" At this point I told him to send me a photo of his iPhone 6's Battery Usage screen on email and we'll continue our conversation there because it's late (and also because I wanted a transcript of our conversation).


He emails me [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/LBH93vh.png) and also sends me a bunch of pictures of his stopwatch to show me how much percentage it loses per minute for some reason? And claims that the battery lasts the exact same with the brightness all the way down and all the way up and that it lasts 4 hours. I reply to him telling him that his battery is just fine according to that picture, quoting [BGR's chart](http://cdn.bgr.com/2014/09/iphone-6-iphone-6-plus-battery-life.jpg?w=624) and tell him to take it to an Apple technician to confirm if the battery is bad before we trade back. Now I knew the battery was fine, I checked it myself with a jailbroken tool before selling it, so I wasn't worried at all.


He writes back again telling me that he ""already checked with other iPhone 6s"" and that the battery lasts just ""under 3 hours"". Hold on a minute, first it was 5 hours, then 4 and now it's 3? Okay then.


I tell him again to find an Apple technician, let them check it out and then bring me proof.


He asks me to come with him, and I know the battery is fine so I tell him I don't have time to go with him but that I trusted him not to do any sort of foul play.


At this point he gets angry for no apparent reason and begins to say that I gave him a broken phone and that if I didn't trade him back, he's going to report the phone as stolen through it's IMEI.


I tell him once again that I'm very sorry but he has to take it to an Apple technician and to stop contacting me, because it was 11 PM at this point on a Monday night. He doesn't say anything anymore then, but in the morning another angry email appears saying how I would also be angry if I were in his shoes and that he's not going to any technician and he's going to report my iPhone 6 Plus as stolen and since I wouldn't face him, he wouldn't face me when my phone stopped working. Granted he came all the way to my house to do the trade initially, he knows where I live, why didn't he come now?


So that morning I go to my carrier to confirm that he can not block my phone through IMEI because it has already been activated with a new contract (mine) and immediately after, I call the guy to tell him this was just a courtesy call, informed him he can't report my phone as stolen, and that I'm still willing to trade back if the battery is really damaged. He tells me he's actually on his way to the Apple technician and that he'll report back, I tell him to email me first because I'm not always available to take calls, and he says he will, and thanks me for giving him the call. Finally got through I thought.


He stopped sending messages that morning, didn't get one that day or the next. I found it very, very odd. This morning I'm sitting here checking back on the pictures he sent me. It's 6 AM and I just woke up, so I'm checking them on my iPhone 6 Plus, when I notice something strange. ""Hmm. This font looks HUGE on my screen, just like my friend's screenshots from her iPhone 5... ...""

Fire up EXIF viewer app on my iPhone, input the picture he sent me: http://i.imgur.com/zRvWBoe.png

Alright, fire up Google search for ""iPhone 5 resolution"": *iPhone 5 display resolution is 1136 x 640 pixels. Measuring 4 inches diagonally, the new touch screen has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and is branded a Retina display with 326 ppi (pixels per inch).*


...


Fucking shit asshole.


**---**


So that happened. I haven't contacted him and I don't plan to, but if he reaches out to me there's a big FUCK YOU awaiting just for him.

apple,"f.lux for iPhone - or, blue light filtering for better sleep","Hey y'all!

After reading a [Verge article](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8278221/screen-use-insomnia-sleep-disruption-sunglasses) on how much blue light hinders restful sleep, I thought there was a strong enough case to request that Apple build this directly into iOS for iPhone, iPad and watchOS. So I sent the below on the feedback form for [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html) and [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/feedback/watch.html).  If you want to help me get Apple's attention on this, you should do the same! Feel free to copy and paste what I submitted in my request.

If you do submit a request, please reply on this thread so I may thank you personally.  If you have suggestions, such as other campaigns (getting Apple's attention on Twitter) please reply!

""I would like f.lux built into iOS and watchOS!  Or at least the same idea.  The article below explains how much blue light effects insomnia and REM sleep, and even suggests a workaround of wearing sunglasses before bed. A software fix is simple, an orange tint overlaying the screen.

apple,Why Taylor Swift is dead wrong about Apple Music,"People are arguing that Apple is being cheap by not paying artists during the 3 month trial period of Apple Music, but they are missing the point. **For Apple, this is not about saving money; this is about avoiding anti-competitive behaviour.**

If Apple were to do as Taylor Swift is demanding, and simply bite the bullet and absorb the costs of those 3 months with their massive cash pile, one could make the argument that Apple is engaging in a [predatory pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing) strategy. It would be using its massive success in one industry to drive out competitors in another industry (streaming music). That is anti-competitive. You can call this predatory pricing or dumping or being a loss leader, but the point is the same - the DOJ would have ammunition to attack Apple and do irreparable harm to the service.

Apple's solution to this is simple, elegant, and perfectly valid - get the record labels on board with the free 3 month trial. If it can convince the music industry to absorb the costs of the 3 month trial, then it is no longer a case of Apple leveraging its own cash pile to drive out competition, rather, it's simply a case of good deal-making. If the record labels agree out of their own volition to the trial period, then this is not predatory pricing. It is not dumping, and it is not anti-competitive. It simply becomes a case of the record industry realizing that to promote its own future prosperity, it has to make a short term sacrifice - in the form of giving away its content for 90 days - in order to get people hooked on this lucrative service, which will secure the record industry's future.

And what about the money that labels and artists will be forgoing during that 90 day period? They'll be getting it back, in the form of [higher royalties](http://www.macworld.com/article/2936054/apple-music-wont-pay-record-labels-for-3-month-free-trials.html) than what the industries normally pays (71.5% to 73%, as opposed to the industry standard of 70%).

At the end of the day, all Taylor Swift is doing is hurting artists. On the surface, it seems noble to ask for a $730 billion company to pay out of pocket, rather than to ask the artists to forgo payment, but it's counter-productive, as it could lead to anti-trust lawsuits that would cause the whole thing to fall apart. Swift is looking for immediate payouts and is not looking at the big picture. Apple's service is trying to secure the future for an industry that has been bleeding for a long time, and Swift's short-term thinking will only serve to help the music industry's profits continue spiraling downward.

**Update:** Apple has completely changed its mind on the matter. Eddy Cue just [Tweeted](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/21/apple-music-free-trial/) that Apple WILL, in fact, pay artists for streaming during the free trial period. It seems they figured that the amount of negative publicity this story was receiving wasn't worth it. Can you imagine if this reversal ends up biting them in the ass via an anti-trust lawsuit? Taylor Swift and the world of social media demanded that Apple pay artists, and the company has listened. If the DOJ uses this free 3 month trial to accuse Apple of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour, Taylor Swift is going to have a lot of answer for. Hopefully that doesn't happen.",194,196,2015-06-21,AAPL,0.06813397258520126,0.9036071300506592,0.028258835896849632

iphone,"Been having a lot of crashes on my iphone 6+ when multitasking, took it to the apple store. Apparently its my fault because I use the phone too much.","Setup: Been having nearly daily hard crashes, usually involved the action of double hitting home button. Having done a full reformat and new install pretty recently (not restore from backup) and not jailbroken, thought this was a hardware issue. Went to the apple store.

After them looking through logs and diagnostics... and 30min for me to reproduce this error... we finally figured out... that im getting these crashes because, well the marketed 'dynamic memory allocation for multitasking'... doesn't actually work all the time and the system will just crash when you are completely out of memory (1 GB RAM is enough apple fanboys say!). The only advice the technician could offer me was... ""Just clean out your multitask menu every once in a while!"", in which hey... there still isn't an easy way to do that. (pretty much the first jailbreak tweak i installed when multitask came to ios was a button that 'cleared all'). 

I guess people could argue that maybe I do use my phone a lot (twitter, games, reddit, etc)... but I don't recall having these crashes when on my iphone 5, which had less memory... so its most likely 64 bit architecture funnies and/or ios 8 bugginess.

I'm not saying that its a big enough deal that I would jump ship to android (have a android for work purposes, has its own share of problems too), but its just kinda bums me out that i've not particularly fond of either OS atm (android 5.1 vs iOS 8.3). It's not 'which is better?' more of 'which is less bad'.

apple,One of the reasons I've been an Apple customer for over 10 years,"My 2011 MBP finally crapped out on me a few days ago, and I thought I was screwed. It wouldn't boot past the loading screen, and there were lines visible - the graphics card was shot. Being out of warranty, I braced myself for several hundred dollars in repair costs.

When I brought it to the genius bar, they verified the graphics card was dead. But then, they told me it was a known issue and they would fix it for free. And not only that, when I got it back today, the following things had been done:

- Replaced graphics card
- Replaced logic board
- Replaced bottom panel (one of the rubber feet went missing eons ago and I'd never bothered to fix it)
- Replaced magsafe internal components

Total service cost: $0. I'm way out of warranty. Replacing the bottom panel and magsafe components were definitely above and beyond what was needed to fix my computer.

Thanks, Apple, once again your customer service reaffirms my loyalty. Just thought I'd share because it made my day.",87,264,2015-06-27,AAPL,0.07197462767362595,0.8744367957115173,0.05358854681253433

apple,FYI from a guy who ran his apple watch through the washer and dryer.,"I thought I would share my mini crisis with all of you lovely people. My wonderful wife just purchased an apple watch for me on Father's Day. I am currently in a training position at work and cannot wear a watch during my shifts. I slipped the watch in the cargo part of my shorts to track my movement. (I just had to fill up all those activity circles!) I move a ton in my work gear, and they need to be washed often. So...I pop my shorts in the washer without thinking and ran a 40+ minute cycle. I then popped my shorts in the dryer for a 60+ minute cycle. Once I realized my mistake, after going to plug in the watch for a nights charge, I quickly ran to my dryer. And guess what? The apple watch is still in tip top shape. I couldn't believe it. I tested every app, sound, and heart rate reading. I still can't really believe it. I did a quick google search looking for similar stories and could not find anything, and thought it would be need to share.

I go out into the field in August, and will wait to wear my watch then!

TLDR; Apple watches will survive a washer and dryer run. Although, I would not recommend!",68,230,2015-06-27,AAPL,0.03732512146234512,0.9274774789810181,0.035197384655475616
apple,"If you are looking to buy a Macbook, you can get a good deal right now stacking some coupons at Best Buy","I was in need of a new computer since my Thinkpad was having some problems so I decided to go for a 15"" rMBP. I ended up only paying $1620 for it, after stacking a few coupons.

Best Buy has a sale on Macs right now. Pretty much all models are on sale. The 15"" unit usually goes for $2000 but it was listed at $1900 since it is $100 off until next week. If you have a .edu e-mail address you get an additional $100 off. Also, I recently moved in with my parents for the summer due to an internship and the post office gave me some coupons for 10% off at Best Buy. Turns out you can get the coupon online as well if you register to change your address: https://moversguide.usps.com/icoa/home/icoa-main-flow.do?execution=e1s1&amp;_flowId=icoa-main-flow&amp;

So, turns out the guys at the computer section of the store wouldn't let me use both coupons. I ended up telling them I would be more comfortable taking the laptop up front to check out, and they let me. I guess they thought I would try and steal the computer though as two guys were following me all the way to the front check out counters, eyeing me the entire time I was there. The check out guy was chill and didn't know anything about coupon stacking so he just scanned them both and they went through. Final price was $1619.

So yeah, if you are looking to buy a Mac now is a good time!",70,132,2015-06-27,AAPL,0.040352921932935715,0.9179494976997375,0.04169754683971405

apple,Best Buy and Apple end ties for warranty repairs,"I work at Best Buy and got a notice yesterday (6/26) that, effective immediately, Best Buy will no longer be allowed to fix any Apple device under the 1st year of warranty, whether the client has Best Buy/Geek Squad warranty or not. So if the person has a 3-year warranty through Best Buy and their computer breaks in the first year, they have to go through Apple. 

Just giving you guys a heads up incase any of you have bought warranties for your Apple products outside of Apple. 

Also, I'm not sure if this is a Best Buy thing and only Best Buys can't facilitate Apple warranty or its an Apple thing and they are taking that ability any from any separate company. 
  


Edit 1: This is for Best Buy in Canada, not sure if same thing is happening for U.S. Best Buys

Edit 2: Anyone with a Mac with the accidental coverage from Best Buy who breaks or spills liquid on their Mac in the first year can still be brought to Best Buy

Edit 3: I want to reiterate that the Best Buy warranty overall is not void on your Macs. All I am simply saying is that Apple has told us that they want all repairs that are covered under their manufacturer warranty to be brought to them. After the 1st year, your macs can be brought to Best Buy

Edit 4: Anyone saying that Best Buy previously fixing an Apple computer under the 1st year warranty then voids the warranty through Apple is simply wrong. At least in Canada. I personally work in Geek Squad and deal with this stuff every day.

apple,Interested in switching to Apple Music? Here's a pro tip for ya. Act fast...,"If you have invested lots of time putting together playlists and building a library on another music streaming service... act fast and set up a free 2-week trial of Beats Music, and then use this [""Beats Importer"" tool](http://www.beatsimporter.com) to import your playlists and albums from Spotify, RDIO, or CSV/XML files.  Do this within the next 2 days.  The tool only imports one public playlist at a time, you have to process it a bit manually, so allocate yourself enough time to get through your favorite ones.  This way, on June 30 when Apple Music is released and Beats Music is (likely to be) closed to new subscriptions and Apple starts directing all existing subscribers to sign up on Apple Music instead, all of your playlists and albums will be migrated over seamlessly.  Much of this is hinted at and explained [in the current Beats Music FAQ](http://www.beatsmusic.com/faq).  Eddy Cue [tweeted](https://twitter.com/cue/status/614795533236854785) it today too.

EDIT TO ADD, 6/2/15:  Anyone trying to use this great tool as a middleman/migration path for Apple Music, I've learned some unfortunate news: 
1) Beats Music is no longer accepting new registrations for any new signups, trials or otherwise. They're now directing everyone to Apple Music. 
2) Apple Music will only migrate from currently-subscribed Beats accounts (2-week trials still underway are, however, eligible.) ""Limited User"" accounts will NOT migrate. This was a real bummer. 
3) Worse, Apple Music will only migrate from a Beats account ONCE. Any attempt to leverage that still-active Beats account a second time, for another user's introduction to Apple Music, will be rejected. 

So there ya have it. It was good while it lasted. Hopefully tools will emerge soon that allow migration from Spotify, Beats and more directly into Apple Music. Fingers crossed that the various services don't put up too many roadblocks to prevent this. Rock on, everybody!


I think it's safe to assume that Apple Music won't have a migration tool for/from Spotify or RDIO (at least not at first) so taking care of this step in the meantime, using Beats as a middleman, might save you a lot of time, and ensure you can enjoy Apple Music on day 1, with the music you've already configured as your favorite, ready to go.  And after June 30, which is 2 days from now, when Apple Music is officially released, this window of opportunity might very well be closed.",113,238,2015-06-28,AAPL,0.04729305952787399,0.925395667552948,0.027311241254210472

I'm not sure if the fault here lies with mplayerx or sourceforge (seeing as they have been very dodgy lately) but either way it is best to steer clear.

Apple's guidelines are fairly simple to use, except the fact that they require you to **download and reinstall the entire OS**, for a factory reset.

Will it require that OS X be a closed platform (like iOS)?
