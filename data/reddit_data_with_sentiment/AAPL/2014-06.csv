apple,One of the biggest unsolved problems that Apple needs to address at WWDC: managing digital photos on iOS.,"In his [WWDC prelude article](http://daringfireball.net/2014/06/wwdc_2014_prelude), John Gruber explains one of the biggest iOS issues that desperately needs more attention: digital photo management on iOS.

&gt;Let us store all the photos we take with our iPhones and iPads in iCloud.
&gt;
&gt;Digital photo management remains an unsolved problem. **What are we supposed to do when our iOS devices run out of space because of all the photos we’re storing on them?** Apple’s solution is from the Mac-as-digital-hub era: plug your iPhone or iPad to your Mac and import your photos into iPhoto. That feels antediluvian today, in a world where some photographers never move their photos off the iPhones on which they took them.
&gt;
&gt;…The goal should be to make it such that an iCloud-using iPhone or iPad user will never lose a photo because they’re lost or broken their device, nor should they ever feel the need to permanently delete photos just because they’ve run out of storage space on the device.

Apple needs to understand this: **people do not connect their iPhones to their computers anymore.** Ask any non-techie on the streets when the last time they connected their iPhone to their computer, and I bet the large majority respond with ""never.""

Additionally, with how popular 16GB iPhones are (or even the measly 8GB iPhone 4S that Apple still sells), people use up their available storage all too quickly — largely because of photos saved on their devices. As a result, it hurts their iPhone experience when they go to take a photo, and [get an error instead](http://i.imgur.com/AmJkqks.png). This really sucks when you're going to take quick photo of something you only have a second for — like a cute moment of your kids — but miss it because you have to delete some old photos off your iPhone because there isn't enough storage available.

That's not the experience people should be having when Apple [is advertising](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jZGzXEExZcc) how great the iPhone is for ""photos every day.""

Here's how photos on the iPhone **should** work:
1. You take a photo.
2. The image is instantly uploaded to iCloud, via cellular or Wi-Fi.
3. A local copy is saved to the device, but there is an option to ""delete local copy once original is uploaded to iCloud.""

Boom, issue resolved.

**Additionally, Photo Stream needs to stop saving all of the last 1,000 images directly on the device.** This is unnecessarily using up 1GB or more of valuable device storage for all those pictures, when the only reason most people use Photo Stream to begin with is to backup their images. Instead, Photo Stream needs to simply pull the last 1,000 images on demand, as the user scrolls though them, as long as the user has a network connection. (a la scrolling through a Facebook photo album; the images load as you scroll.)

Everpix and Loom were great alternatives to Photo Stream that did just this, but both services have since bought out and shutdown. [Carousel](https://www.carousel.com/) by Dropbox, and [PictureLife](https://picturelife.com) are the only two contenders left, but since they're not directly integrated into iOS, the issue of local storage being used up remains a problem.

I really hope Apple implements their own service to resolve this issue because it is affecting far more people than I think they realize.

-----

~~**EDIT:** After today's announcements, it looks like the problem may be only partially solved.~~

- ~~Photos Stream will no longer save images directly on the device, but instead will load them as you scroll. This is great! But there are stop some issues...~~

- ~~This still doesn't solve the key problem of what to do with the original photos saved in the Camera Roll. There needs to be an option to 'auto delete' the original files off the device, once uploaded to iCloud.~~

- Also, iCloud still only gives you 5GB of free TOTAL storage. Many people have more than 5GB of data on their devices, let alone 5GB of pictures.

~~So what happens if a user's iOS device runs out of storage because of all their pictures in their Camera Roll? The same thing as today — they have to sync their iPhone to their computer and delete photos manually.~~

~~The problem is still only half-solved.~~

**EDIT 2:** The issue is solved. As per [Apple's webpage for the feature](http://apple.com/ios/ios8/photos/):

&gt; Fill your library, not your device. iCloud Photo Library helps you make the most out of the space available on your iOS device, so you can spend more time shooting pictures and less time managing them. It can automatically keep the original high-resolution photos and videos in iCloud and leave behind lightweight versions that are perfectly sized for each device.",194,460,2014-06-02,AAPL,0.06037258356809616,0.9119497537612915,0.027677617967128754

&gt;Implementation of a ""dark mode"" in iOS 8.

**Feedback type / Classification:**
&gt;Enhancement request

**Comments:**
&gt;The user interface of iOS is very bright, and features white, high contrast backgrounds in nearly all its default apps. Such bright backgrounds can be distracting to users when their devices are used in a dimly lit environment. The result can be eye strain and fatigue, and it hurts the user experience.
&gt;
&gt;Inclusion of a ""dark mode"" for iOS 8 (similar to the recently announced ""dark mode"" in OS X Yosemite) would be widely utilized by users at night, or in environments where light is minimal. For instance: when riding in a car after sunset, as a passenger on an overnight flight, or simply laying in bed next to a sleeping spouse. 
&gt;
&gt;Such a mode would, ideally, turn white backgrounds into black backgrounds, and feature a dark keyboard.
&gt;
&gt;Please consider the inclusion of a ""dark mode"" in iOS 8 to prevent eye strain and improve user safety and comfort while using iOS devices in dimly lit environments.

And if you have more room, here's a few other tidbits you can throw in...

&gt;* A ""dark mode"" already exists in the Maps app, when the user is driving at night. iOS detects the dark environment via an ambient light sensor, and alters the colors of the app. A similar, system-wide implementation would be ideal.
&gt;* Currently, using the ""invert colors"" option in Accessibility settings is a workaround to dealing with the overwhelming brightness of iOS; however it is not an ideal solution, as enabling this setting inverts all colors on the screen, distorting pictures and icons in the process.
&gt;* The brightness of iOS, and the eye strain it causes at night, is widely known and discussed. For example, as more pilots begin to use iPads in the cockpit of their airplanes, they report difficultly in their ability to see due to the device's brightness. (Source: http://ipadpilotnews.com/2012/10/enable-night-mode-to-save-your-vision/)
&gt;* Such implementations have already been developed in the modifications / ""jailbreak"" community, with apps such as ""Eclipse"" and ""Nightmode."" These modes preserve the color of iOS apps and photos, but simply replace white backgrounds with dark gray / black ones. (Source: http://www.todaysiphone.com/2014/02/preview-nightmode-tweak/)

apple,Your annual reminder: Beta operating systems are highly unstable,"Installing a beta OS can result in your data being permanently destroyed and your device becoming unrecoverable. It's important to note that in these cases, you've sort-of voided your warranty - Apple don't have to fix your device for free if it was damaged by beta software, even if it was Apple's beta software. (Note: this is apparently not the case with the OS X public beta.) It's also worth noting that a beta OS can brick an iOS device.

This is more relevant than ever now that Yosemite has a public beta. Your Mac's hard drive could be completely hosed. If you've got more than one Mac in your life, don't install it on your daily driver. Same goes for your phone and iPad.

As always, **back up your entire drive before installing beta software**, but more seriously, think about whether you actually *need* to install it. Yes, it's fun to play around with, but it's also much slower, much less usable, much more buggy. After the initial novelty has worn off, you'll suddenly find you've replaced one of the most important devices in your life with a version that's slower, doesn't work as well and crashes all the time - oh, and might just destroy all your data.

And when you ignore this advice and install it anyway, and it crashes and screws up your phone, and you post a thread about it here, don't expect any sympathy. 😛",135,296,2014-06-03,AAPL,0.18759603798389435,0.7856354117393494,0.026768533512949944

apple,How the Next Macbook Air could get even Thinner,"Today at Computex, Intel released a new breed of CPU's named Core M.

Intel's Core M CPU's are based on the latest 14nm Fabrication Process (code-named Broadwell) which shrinks the size of transistors and use 20-30% less power while maintaining the same performance.

http://www.cnet.com/news/intel-core-m-chip-means-really-thin-windows-8-1-hybrids-are-on-the-way/

Haswell already has ultra low power CPU's (ULT Series) seen in the current gen Macbook Air. But these new Core M CPU's allow for a Fanless Designs thanks to their 10w or less TDP. TDP is a measurement of how much heat a chip produces.  By comparison, a iPad air SOC uses around 7-8w full load. This information is all based off Anandtech articles.

Asus had a Fanless Broadwell Based, Transformer Book T300 on display at computex and it's unbelievably thin thanks to the lack of a fan.

This will allow apple to shrink it's MacBook Air Product Line. 

Lets take a look at the Macbook Air. 

http://imgur.com/esdXlE6

While your looking at this image, think to yourself, how could apple make this device thinner?  Starting with the Magsafe 2 Connector, followed by USB 3.0, and then the headphone jack.

On the top side of the device, we have a standard TN panel. 

Now how do we get this thinner?

Well on the top side, where the display is, Apple could transition to IGZO Panels which use a lot less power and are much thinner. The iPad Air and iPad Retina Mini both use IGZO panels.  Apple could also fuse the display to the cover glass, which would reduce glare and make the lid thinner.

Now lets take a look at the business end of the notebook.  

The Magsafe Connector would almost have to be redesigned (again) to allow for a thinner design. Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 uses a thinner (but longer) design. http://imgur.com/g4MVDnH.jpg

Moving along the edge of the MBA, we get to the USB 3.0 Port. USB 3.1 has been certified and will start shipping in devices this fall. USB 3.1 brings a new thinner connector (type c), as well as doubles the available bandwidth to 10 Gbps (just like the original thunderbolt).  The Type C connector is shown here: http://imgur.com/sMyrxB5.jpg

I doubt apple will use the Type C connector until it's more widely available, however i would guess that this option is on the drawing boards in jony ive's lab.

Finally we reach the headphone connector. Apple has a couple of options here. They could go to the smaller 2.5mm jack, or they could remove it all together and just use bluetooth. 

on the other side of the Macbook Air we have a thunderbolt, SD Card reader, ~~and a HDMI port.  HDMI already has a smaller sibling called mini HDMI,~~ and the card reader is already pretty slim.  The only limiting factor on this side is the thunderbolt connector. It would have to be totally redesigned, or removed from the Air all together.

At the end of the day, Apple has several options if they want to make the MacBook Air thinner, but it's a balancing act. How many features must they alter and is it even worth the extra thin profile?  When you remove a I/O option, people bring out the pitchforks. Remember when apple removed ""Ethernet"" from the Macbook Pro's?

I look forward to this fall when the new Broadwell Macbook Air's are released. I'm by no means a journalist, but a tech enthusiast who likes to discuss the design of products and the challenges that Jony Ive and other designers face.

apple,A new Finder design inspired by Safari in Yosemite.,"Since watching the WWDC keynote and pouring over the new Yosemite screenshots I've been kind of disappointed to find that the Finder hasn't received the overhaul that other apps have. (aside from the new flat icon).

However after looking at the redesign and simplification of the Safari toolbar I started wondering if those concepts could be applied to the Finder. Would it be possible to make Finder look simpler, while increasing its utility? Since I'm a Web design/UI guy I thought I would give it a shot.

I was pretty happy with the results, so [I made an Imgur album of my experiment ](http://imgur.com/a/38yM2) which I'd appreciate your feedback on. Have I improved anything, or have I just created more problems? Do you think I should spend more time polishing these designs or am I wasting my time?

Please note that the images are only wireframes, they're not polished UI mockups. So there are some dodgy icons, font inconsistencies and alignment issues.

Cheers.

**EDIT** Thanks so much for the feedback, a lot of it has been useful. For all the people commenting on the **horrible folder icons, drab colour palette and general lack of finesse**, I agree with you. These mockups are rough designs to show functionality, I didn't want to get bogged down in creating pixel perfect icons and tweaking colours for hours before I knew the ideas weren't universally despised.

Since the community feedback has been largely positive, I'm going to spend time fleshing out these designs, and I should post something back in a day or two. Sorry, progress has been slowed by the new season of ""Orange is the New Black""

**EDIT 2** I've started refining the designs. A new version of ""Top Places"" which incorporates changes from your feedback is here: http://imgur.com/nXIAvIY",74,345,2014-06-07,AAPL,0.03696747124195099,0.9098532795906067,0.05317922309041023

* One app per comment. Make your comment top-level for increased visibility.
* Any Apple-made platform. iOS and OS X are both game.
* Include relevant info: Price, platform, app store links...
* Mention what the app does in a sentence or two, and perhaps how you use it.
* Vote as much as possible. If you're downvoting, it would be great to include a reply stating why.

ipad,"PSA: What you should do if you find an iPad (or other item), and how you can LEGALLY gain ownership of it.","After reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/27nexg/found_lost_ipad_owner_does_not_respond_after/), I am a bit shocked at how easily someone was able to get the /r/iPad community to help them bypass the security on an iPad. I am more shocked at how many downvotes were given to people who were reasonably advising the OP on the *actual* right thing to do.

Disclaimer: IANAL.

**First**: Obviously, see if there is any contact information on the device itself. If so, try to get in touch with the owner. But don't stop here. Move to the next step...

**Second**: Look up the ""found property"" or ""Lost and mislaid property"" laws in your jurisdiction. This is important. A couple months ago, [someone posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/265m5t/i_just_found_an_ipad_at_the_intersection_of_a/) about finding an iPad and, in their jurisdiction, they only had 48 hours to turn it into police.

Many of you may be thinking (like some of you said in the thread I linked to first), ""If I give it to the police, then I don't get it back!"" This is a legitimate concern. After all, if I find something that is valuable, I want to keep it in the scenario that the owner can't get it back. However, that is why you look up the laws in your area. As I explained to [the OP in Connecticut](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/265m5t/i_just_found_an_ipad_at_the_intersection_of_a/chnx1mh), their statutes require that the property be held by police for a few months and then the finder can ask for it back. There is no serious risk of ""conspiracy"" from police to steal your stuff as far as I know and, most importantly, if you don't follow the statutes then you put yourself at risk.

In other words... there are a lot of legitimate ways you can try to find the owner of lost property, and many of those ways would go above and beyond what Police may do — **however**, as far as the law is concerned, you must follow the statutory steps in order to protect yourself from committing a crime and, ultimately, to have a chance at legally owning the item. It's the most fair way for everyone under the circumstance.

Finally, another reason to check the laws is because **not all found property is lost property.** There is a difference between **LOST** and **MISLAID** property. Put simply, property is ""lost"" when it is found in an area that the owner never intended it to be (imagine you walk down the street and your phone falls out of your pocket somewhere along the way... you have no idea where it could be, and its location is completely unknown... it is lost). Property is ""mislaid"" when it is found in an area that the owner intended to put it, but merely forgot about (imagine you set your phone down on the table at a club and then leave without picking it up). 

The point of this post is that there are a lot of things that can and should be done when you find something of value in order to help get it back to its owner and, if you can't, have a **legitimate** and **lawful** reason to keep it — but none of those things should include helping some random person online bypass the security of a device, especially when they admit they have failed to do what is likely legally required of them.",46,101,2014-06-09,AAPL,0.06660960614681244,0.9066756963729858,0.026714665815234184

- Widgets and more information are now readily available in Notification Center

- iCloud finally FINALLY gets a proper file system. 

- Extensions COME BACK FROM THE DEAD (See: Mac OS v. 1-9) but in a different way : http://imgur.com/zuHDfEg Here you can input things into the ""Share Menu"" and change things that augment the today menu in the notification center.

- Energy Saver icon changes to the newer LED standard light bulb. Awww. And the trash can is now a VR White solo cup of some sort. It matches the theme. 

- Dashboard is gone by default. (along with it's easy-open fn-F12 command that should open up Notification widgets at least) Apple is advising developers to pretend like it will be removed in a few beta releases. (But it's still in /Applications/)

- Spotlight lets you send an email, make a call, or make quick calculations, instead of a drop down menu, it appears as a quicksilver like centered window upon using CMD-SPACE command. Spotlight is essentially turning into Sherlock of the Mac OS 9 days. It will search the web to answer what you need.

- Mail will now let you send attachments as large as 5GB ! The file goes to iCloud by itself and the sendee can download it from a link or within their Mail client. 

- Tight integration with your iOS 8 device. You'll see your iPhones/iPads Messages, notifications, etc. Can use your Mac as a speaker phone for your iPhone. 

- Hot spot (Continuity feature) supposedly forces your phone to allow you to tether Internet from your phone, no matter what your carrier thinks. (for further research) [ edit: /u/ElectricOctopus says 10.10 will auto-negotiate internet out of your phone to your laptop (you don't have to configure your phone), as long as you have tethering activated w/ your carrier ]

- Full screen icon is gone. But, it has been moved into the Green button on the upper left side of each window. http://imgur.com/f8yIWtB You can revert to good old greeny if you want by holding down the option key while you click. (then greeny turns to + )

- Photo.app might replace iPhoto in the future. (2015)

apple,Why does it bug me so much that Verizon opens your devices?,"Ok so I don't know if this drives anyone else insane, but It gets on my nerves so much. So in December I got a iPhone 5s through Verizon, I got it in the store. Well when they got the phone from the back they took it and opened the box and took the phone it self out and took off the screen protector thing, turned it on, and claimed they need to 'activate', something that anyone can do, and I'm okay with that, but the fact that they pass the whole set up process, and go the home screen pisses me off. Like when I get home I actually restore the whole thing so that I can set it up right. Like what If I didn't already have the free apps (iMovie, iWork, etc.) and they passed that and I can't get them. (I already have them on iCloud. Then today I got a iPad mini through Verizon and they did the same thing, they even threw away the wrap on it (I don't care about that, but I don't think they should have.), then she went and pass the whole set up process again, so I had to come home and restore it again. And I also hate that they try to make you buy everything in the store, like when she came out with the actual device she brought out like 5 accessories, screen protecters (which I actually bought because they weren't a bad deal), 3 cases, and some other thing. And kept asking me ""well what happens, if this or that"". Then when I bought the screen protecters she didn't even ask me if I wanted her to put them on, she just did it. (I wouldn't actually care if she put them on or not) but she put it on and messed it up, like left bubbles. I don't know if its me or not but it really just gets on my nerves, anyone else like this or does it happen at Apple stores, or with other carriers? 

Edit: Also not to mention how long I had to wait in the store, there were probably only 2 other people in the store (which were getting scammed my the stupid verizon edge crap) and I saw a total of 5 employees.",379,530,2014-06-11,AAPL,0.06739423424005508,0.9046759605407715,0.02792974002659321

ipad,My iPad Air vs iPad 2 post. Recently upgraded and this is my experience.,"Doing this for those considering the upgrade. I looked for some of these myself while contemplating the upgrade and thought I'd help everyone else. 

Battery: Seems to charge faster and last longer. My iPad 2 was two years old so the battery may have degraded but the Air's battery seems to charge much faster and last longer. 

Screen: The Air's screen is a thing of absolute beauty. Sometimes I just stare at it in fascination because it can be so pretty. 

Size: The Air seems so much smaller and lighter than the iPad 2 even though the screen size is the same. I get tired less easily (I'm a fit 22 male) from holding it and it's remarkably thin.

Performance: Games/Apps not only look better on the Air but perform extremely well compared to the 2. Air can get somewhat warm during extensive gaming but never to the point of bothering me. 

Weighing the cons (price) versus these pros: I had the 16gb wifi iPad 2 and i upgraded to the 32gb wifi iPad Air. The Air ran $565 on Amazon with free shipping. After selling my iPad 2 for $200 and trading in some items on Amazon ($360) I didn't pay anything for the new iPad so it was kind of a no-brainer in the end. 

The biggest takeaway you should consider is being able to sell the iPad 2 for at least $200. I posted it on craigslist and sold it that evening (even with a small dent in the corner). AMA if you have other concerns.",33,51,2014-06-12,AAPL,0.024281838908791542,0.8890376687049866,0.08668050169944763

TwelveSouth makes shelf you can put on the back but I didn't want to spend 30-40 dollars so i found another solution to keeping my hard drive out of sight.

I just used three zip ties to tie my hard drive to the back of my iMac.

It may not be the greatest if you remove the hard drive like daily but mine can slip in and out without any problems.  For some reason it took me a year before i thought of this simple solution so I just thought I'd share it here in case there were others who have had similar thoughts.

apple,PSA for anyone having file sharing problems in Mavericks,"I run an all-Mac startup that relies heavily on file sharing between network mounted machines. We work in at large live events, so surprises in our software are a bit more problematic than in many applications.

At a recent event we found that our networked drives (we had a few dozen mounted) were randomly un-mounting. In un-mounting they'd kill part of our software that relies on the connected drive, and throw an SMB error. We worked the problem like it was a network issue- tried different DNS and DHCP settings, tried a new file server, new router- many hours of troubleshooting. We even called Apple developer support (who got back to us days later saying they can't help us).

We finally found a thread on Apple's support site with thousands of replies, with people complaining of the exact same symptoms. As it turns out, Apple has moved the default file sharing in Mavericks over to SMB2 (we knew this much), however the version they used is their own creation as they didn't have the license to take the full version from Microsoft. Their version of SMB2 is filled with issues- Remote Desktop barely functions, you don't get proper DNS support, ACL's and many file attributes don't transfer correctly, and most critically it often fails authentication between computers and mounted drives, causing them to unmount.  We forced AFP using command-k in the same environment and everything was back to normal. 

This is a HUGE issue for us and I would imagine any pro user who relies on mounted drives. It's nice that Apple is making OS X more pretty and fun, but they are screwing pro users completely by their poor decisions and lack of communication in changing vital, basic features. AFP was a shining example of Apple's programming prowess.. it's a shame to see it not only deprecated but replaced with a sloppy iteration of Windows sharing that barely functions.",18,54,2014-06-14,AAPL,0.07108641415834427,0.8953720927238464,0.033541470766067505

apple,I got one of these out of curiosity...,"iPhone 6 model. Pictures are below in the comments. 

I know it's not real but it is obvious by this point it's the final design. Give or take a few small details. 

I just wanted to share some of my thoughts on how it feels in case any of you are interested. 

It feels great though. The size is perfect for a phone and the rounded edges feel amazing in the hand. Even better than the 5/5S squared off design. 

I also really like the new power button placement. Fits perfectly under where I rest my thumb. 

Final thing I notice is the thinness. It is crazy thin and my iPhone 5S and Nexus 5 now feel fat when I hold them. It's stupid I know but they do. 

I just wish I could turn this thing on ;)

apple,"I'm an iOS ""fanboy"" and I finally decided to try an Android device. Here are my thoughts, if you care.","**LONG POST INCOMING**

I’ve been an iPhone user since the first iPhone came out in 2007. I waited until they dropped price and then went out and bought it. Since then, I’ve had every generation and have been a pretty die-hard iOS fan (and an Apple fan in general).

I’m also a gadget geek and a fan of technology, so when the opportunity came for me to get another phone for work (in addition to my iPhone 5s for personal use), I opted to get an Android device. My new job makes heavy use of Google services (Drive, Docs, Gmail, etc…), so I figured why not get the phone that works best with these?

After doing heavy research, I decided to ultimately settle on the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (unlocked, bought from Amazon, and running on the T-Mobile network). A few reasons for this:

1. Screen size. I’m a small guy with small hands. And I prefer using my phone one-handed. The 4.3 inch display is a still a little big for me (I really think Apple nailed it with the 4 inch display on the 5/5s as the sweet-spot, and I’m going to be highly disappointed when the 6 ups this size), but I’ll deal with it.

2. Uncompromising specs. Sony did something that I hope Apple does with the 6 (and what it does with the iPad Air and mini) by making the screen size the only differentiating factor between its Z1 and Z1 Compact models. Spec-wise, the Compact is still a screaming fast phone. Too often it seems device manufacturers think mini = slower (look at what HTC did with the Mini 1 &amp; 2), but that’s not the case here.

3. Sony design. I do web design/development for a living, and I’m a huge fan of clean, minimalistic designs. It’s why I love Apple and the work Ive puts out. I’ve also always liked Sony’s design language. It shows in the Z1 Compact. It may have a plastic back (and even then, I couldn’t tell it was plastic - feels like glass), but it’s a premium looking and feeling device. Feels great in the hand. Also: it’s waterproof! Not water-resistant like that P.O.S. Samsung phone. That’s just very cool.

Quick disclaimer: I think Samsung is the scummiest company ever, and I have a serious bias against them. But just them! No problem with other Android OEMs like HTC (the One’s design is cool too, and I would’ve gotten it if it wasn’t for that humungo screen) or Motorola or even LG.

I’ve used the Z1 Compact for a week now. It’s the first time I’ve used an Android device for that length of time, after years of using iOS. I’m going to try to come across as unbiased, but below are my thoughts on the device and the OS (updated to KitKat). First, the criticisms:

1. No dedicated voice command button. Now, this could be a hardware thing (I’ve never used a Galaxy device, and I know they have physical home buttons), but it seems most other Android devices these days have eschewed those for software buttons. The problem there is, as someone who actually uses and loves voice command (Siri), there’s no way to quickly pull up Google Now on my device. Say what you want about Siri’s reliability, speed, accuracy, whatever, but it’s always there at the hold of the Home button. Even when the screen is off. I’ve used Siri to set timers, set reminders, set calendar events, get movie times, etc… and I’ve often done this without looking at the phone (in the car, for example). Maybe I’m missing something, but there’s no easy way to do this on my Android device.

2. On that same note- the software buttons are stupid. Here’s the Apple fanboy in me coming out, but I think Apple did this right with having that physical home button. Android’s software buttons basically do the same thing that the iPhone/iPad Home button does. Go to the home screen? Single-tap the Home button. Bring up multitasking? Double-tap the Home button. But the worst thing Android does is that stupid “back” button. You never know what you’re going to get when you hit this thing. If I’m viewing a message in Gmail and I hit it, it brings me back to the Gmail Inbox. Hit it again and it brings me to the home screen. If I’m in Chrome, it acts as a browser back button. From a design standpoint, it’s confusing to the user. On top of that, there’s redundancies. If you’re viewing a message in Gmail in Android, you can already hit the button at the top left (the way iOS does it). Why have an extra button at the bottom that does this?
And I think even with the slightly bigger screen, the software buttons took up real estate and ended up making the screen the same size as the iPhone’s. Take something like Google Maps for example. With those persistent software buttons on the bottom, the Android app ends up showing less of the map than the iPhone app (we might be taking in millimeters, but still). I can see use cases where it might be useful to have those software buttons go away (or turn transparent) for stuff like viewing movies or in the camera app, but most apps leave these on the bottom (Chrome for example - again, the iOS version has slightly more screen real estate).

3. Widgets. *This is more of a ""I don't get the big deal"" bullet-point rather than an outright criticism.* I found these things useless. I can see if you’re using your phone for a very specific purpose how it might be good to have. But for the most part, I really didn’t see the need for them. Maybe this is the iOS mentality, but I just wanted to get into an app and do my thing and not spend too much time on the home screens. I think that’s the fundamental difference between the two OSs- iOS seems to be very much about the apps. It wants to get out of your way so you can be within an app. It’s app-centric. Android is about itself. The one exception here is that I did like having a little weather icon on my lock screen. That’s about it.
And here’s the other thing- I thought Android had dynamic icons. Maybe there’s something I’m missing (I’m talking about out-of-the-box stuff here, not tweaks), but my Google Calendar app just displays “31” even though that’s not the date. My clock icon is static. Same with any weather apps I download. Not that iOS has this (though it does have a dynamic stock clock and calendar icons), but I thought that this was a cool feature that Android would have.

4. When I first got the phone, I started customizing it, moving stuff around, changing wallpapers, etc… I started having some issues with my T-Mobile service (unrelated to the phone, this turned out to be a T-Mobile problem), and they asked me to reset my phone to factory settings at one point in their troubleshooting process. When I did that, I had to start from square one again. Is there something I’m missing here? I get the feeling that this is just me not knowing something rather than a lack of a feature, but where’s “Restore from backup?” iOS does this brilliantly, in my opinion. You store everything (and I mean everything, every app setting, every downloaded app, etc…) in iCloud, and when you restore your device or get a new one, it’s almost like nothing has changed. On my Z1, I had to download everything again and configure my settings again. Is there no seamless way to do this?

5. Redundancies. Redundancies, everywhere! Granted I don’t have a stock Android phone, but I’m guessing the majority of Android phones out there aren’t stock (if Samsung’s sales figures are to be believed), so I think this is a valid concern. “Just root it” isn’t an answer here, I’m talking out-of-the-box. I started up my phone and I have Sony’s apps for Album and Camera, and I have Google’s. I have Gmail and I have Email. I have a Sony app store (or whatever the hell Sony Select is) on here and I have Google Play. I had a Settings app and I had a Google Settings app. And I can’t delete any of these, my only option is to download something that helps me “Hide” them from my App Launcher. Which one do I use? Which one is better? I bet it’s worse on Samsung devices with all the “S” branded apps. 

6. When iOS introduced “Control Center” the immediate reaction from the Android world was “oh, you mean like Settings in the notification pull-down?” But no, it’s not like that. Control Center is better. A quick swipe up from the bottom of the screen and I can access a myriad of options on iOS. Including a flashlight and a timer! The Settings tab in the notifications pull-down on Android is an extra step. This might sound nitpicky, but considering I use Control Center ALL THE TIME, this extra step felt tedious.

7. Touch response. I feel like this is only something someone coming from iOS would understand. And it’s not a huge annoyance, but it’s there. As “buttery” as Android might claim to be, there’s still something off about its touch response compared to iOS. Might be microseconds, and it might just be in my head. It’s like there’s a small delay between when you drag your finger down (like on Chrome) and when the screen actually moves down. Am I crazy? Maybe I’m crazy.

8. Apps. It’s the good ones I miss when making that transition from iOS to Android. iOS seems to attract FANTASTIC developers who make really great apps. Maybe someone can suggest some to me, but I haven’t found anything comparable to these iOS-only apps on the Google Play store: Tweetbot, OmniFocus, Fantastical, Dark Sky/Weather Line, Reeder 2, AlienBlue (and no, Reddit is Fun and Bacon Reader are nice, but not nice enough IMO). And all these above are my frequently used/front-and-center apps. There is nothing comparable on the Play store with the amount of polish and care that these developers have put into these apps. Also, something weird: I downloaded a Dark Sky rip-off called Arcus. And then since I like paying for apps (and hate ads), I went and bought something called the Arcus Weather Pro Key to upgrade. Both were in my app drawer. Is this how in-app purchases work on Android? Very clunky if so.

9. The previous point brings me to this one… polish. The Android counterparts to iOS apps felt clunky and messy. There was no cohesiveness to them (this is coming from a design standpoint, of course). Evernote on iOS looks awesome. Clean, simple, minimalistic. Evernote on Android does not. Maybe Evernote will bring these changes to its Android app as well. But iOS was clearly the priority, and I think a lot of developers see it that way as well. Apps come to iOS first, and in my opinion, they look best on iOS. Hell, I actually think the Gmail app on the iPhone looks better than the one on Android. Ditto with the Hangouts app.

10. Android doesn’t feel like a finished or polished product to me out-of-the-box. It relies on you to tweak it and finish it yourself. It’s like when you go to a Tex-Mex restaurant and order a fajita and they bring you everything separately and expect you to put it together the way you want. Some people like that experience (my dad, for one). I prefer just getting a burrito ready-to-eat.

Ok, ok, I didn’t like a lot of things. But there must be some stuff I liked, right? Yep! I tried to keep an open mind despite my iOS way-of-thinking, so-

1. Clear all notifications button. Why doesn’t iOS have this? It’s such a no-brainer that its omission in iOS just seems silly.

2. At least on my Xperia Z1 Compact, I had a dedicated camera button. As someone who takes a lot of pictures, I LOVED this. One tap of this and instant camera launch. This might be a feature that iPhones never get, but it’s very useful.

3. Default apps. I liked that I could make Gmail my default mail app, among others. This seems like another no-brainer for iOS to have. Maybe we’ll see it with iOS 9.

4. I think Tasker is pretty awesome. I could set it up so that when I plugged my headphones in, it would launch Spotify. If I’m below a certain battery level, it can automatically turn off some things. It’s a level of automation that I wish iOS would have as well, though I’m sure if Apple did do this, it would be baked in and not through a third-party app.

5. REALLY looking forward to getting SwiftKey/predictive typing when iOS 8 comes out. Also: loved the way Android apps “spoke” to each other. With the dozens of APIs and Extensions coming with iOS 8, this is going to become less of a feather in Android’s hat, but gotta give credit where credit is due in terms of having it before iOS.

I’m sure I’ll have more gripes and also more likes as I continue using this Android phone. Maybe I’ll do a follow-up. Since I know people get worked up over criticisms of their favorite tech gadgets, I’m going to note here that these are ALL MY OPINIONS. I might even be wrong with some of these criticisms, and I welcome anybody to politely point out workarounds or say “but Android DOES do that!”

Bottom line: I’m not switching. And at the trajectories both OSs are headed in, I don’t see that changing for quite some time. What has changed throughout the experience of using a device with a different OS is that I can see why a LOT of people like Android. They like fajitas, and that’s ok. Ultimately, even my criticisms can come off as nitpicks because both OSs are on equal footing these days in terms of capabilities (or at least will be with iOS 8). Those same nitpicks are important to me, however, because UX and UI are things that I look out for, and I just don’t think Google and Android are there yet. Maybe some day.

Sorry for the long post! If you read through it, I welcome your comments and will respond to as many as I can.

apple,Apple Maps is finally improving POI data and listening to customers,"The biggest problem with Apple Maps has always been the POIs. So many are missing, they're often placed in the wrong location, and worst of all, using the *'Report a Problem'* feature seemed to be useless, as none of the user's suggestions are ever implemented. This is how it was when Apple Maps was introduced in iOS 6 and this is how it was in the nearly 2 years since then. I have been periodically using the *'Report a Problem'* feature for 2 years and none of the changes I recommended for my neighborhood were ever implemented.....**until now.**

Over the past month, I've noticed a TON of changes. POI markers are being moved to their correct locations, names and information for POIs are being corrected, and tons of places are being added that simply weren't there before. I don't know if it's merely coincidence, but A LOT of these changes are the exact ones that I've been reporting to Apple.

And I've noticed this happening on a weekly cycle. It seems like every Friday, a whole bunch of new changes are implemented in my neighborhood. All week, nothing happens, but then when I check on Friday/Saturday, I see that many of the suggestions that I had made during the week were suddenly implemented into the map, and its POIs suddenly look a whole lot better.

**Maps is FINALLY improving. I've seen more improvements to the POIs in my area over the past month than I had seen in the previous 2 years COMBINED. It still has a long way to go, but after years of frustration, we're finally seeing some real forward momentum.**

I should also add that I've noticed a method to how things are implemented. It seems like Apple is taking a very specific path regarding how it's fixing these problems; these POI improvements are not happening at random. Larger, more popular places like banks and grocery stores seem to take priority. When you report them, they get fixed faster, while some small mom and pop store on the corner takes a bit longer.",53,62,2014-06-20,AAPL,0.07454348355531693,0.8796385526657104,0.045817915350198746
apple,"I'm an Android ""fanboy"" and I finally decided to try an iOS device. Here are my thoughts, if you care.","Noticed the popularity of yesterday's post, figured I'd offer my opinion in coming the other way. 

My first ""smart device"" was an iPod touch that I purchased back in 2008. I suppose this could qualify as my first iOS device, but since it is not a phone, I am excluding it from this list. Since then I have used  Android devices exclusively up until this week.
me
I am a tech enthusiast and love to tinker with my devices pushing them to their full potential. 

After considering several new devices, of which most were Android, I decided on the iPhone 5s (unlocked 32gb, off contract, bought from Swappa) for several reasons. 

1. Appearance: The closest I've gotten to a ""Apple-esque"" style phone would have to be the HTC One. It was the first android I've owned that felt premium. The iPhone 5s, does not disappoint in this department. I paid several hundred dollars for this device, I'm glad that it doesn't feel cheap.

2. Experience: Seeing as this was my first time back since **iPhone OS 2.1** I wanted to make sure I got the full experience. This is my first time on iOS 7 and 8, and I wanted to make sure the device was not my limiting factor on how I felt. 

3. Walled Garden: I leaned towards the openness of Android, as I like to make everything my own, and highly customize it. With the introduction of iOS 8, I felt it was the first time that I was getting some of the control back (3rd party keyboards, etc).


Background: I've owned a Droid X, Galaxy S3, HTC One (M7), and a Nexus 5. That is four different manufacturers, four different skins, and four different experiences. All of those have all been rooted, and custom ROM'd at some point except for the Droid X. 

I am also a heavy Google services user, but I shall try to avoid letting that skew my opinion. 


**So after one week on iOS what have I liked?**

1. iCloud: There is simply no comparison on Android, for a complete backup solution, that is easy to work, and requires little effort. This is not a feature natively built into Android. With my HTC One I did have HTC Backup which keep my home screen settings, accounts, and passwords, and apps and settings. This was about the closest I've had to iCloud, but it is not a COMPLETE backup solution, which is very handy to have. 

2. Apps: Simply put, they seem better built on iOS. Android still this day in age, seems to be an after thought for many developers. Even several Google apps that I used daily, have features that their counterparts lack. I've never had an issue with malware or spam apps, but there is no doubt that the Appstore is much more curated than the Google Play Store. 

3. Siri: I used Google Now (GN) all the time on my Android devices, and while it worked well, it is built like a search engine, and not a personal assistant. You cannot change system settings with GN, something that Siri handles with ease, and Siri is able to handle a much wider range of questions. The voice recognition seems to work better as well (English, no accent). 

4. Ease of use: Now this may be a downside to some, but the fact that the appearance has changed very little over time, makes iOS one of the easiest operating systems to use. I picked up the phone and felt immediately familiar to the days of my iPod touch. Each Android phone I've owned has had a vastly different feel, and while some of that does add to the experience and feature set, I can't help but feel slightly unfamiliar picking up a new Android phone.  

5. Touch ID: My phone rarely leaves my sight/pocket, and as such I typically leave my devices without a pin code setup. I'll check my phone for few seconds quite frequently, and having to type in a code  was quite bothersome. With that being said, I do have a pin code setup on my 5s, but with Touch ID that mitigates the necessity of having to type it in. It's quite quick, and the only times it's failed on me have been when my hands are greasy or dirty which is understandable. 

6. Fragmentation: With having only a few devices, fragmentation is very limited on iOS devices. Updates are also available much more rapidly compared to Android. I've had devices abandoned much sooner then I would imagine, and this issue just doesn't really exist on iOS. 

**So after one week of not having Android (HTC One) what have I missed?**


1. Screen Size: This is person dependent, and for me, the iPhone 5s is to small. I've played around with screen sizes from 3.5"" to 5.7"" and found that my sweetspot is around 4.7"". This is something Android has a benefit with as there's a multitude of devices, and screen sizes. 

2. Front Facing Speakers: This was one of my biggest draws towards the HTC One, it looks amazing, and sounds amazing. There really is no mobile equivalent it terms of speaker quality. It makes a world of difference when showing a friend a video/vine/snapchat/etc in a crowded/noisy environment. 

3. Default apps: If I don't like the default app that Google, or a manufacturer provides me out of the box, I can switch that app out for something else. This isn't possible on iOS, so you're stuck using the default, or trying to workaround the platform using a 3rd party app.

4. Rooting/ROMS: If I don't like the ""skin"" that my phone has, I can put a custom ROM on it, and completely change the look/feel/feature set/performance. I've added things that even stock Android doesn't have, along with various tweaks, that enable me to change literally a million and a half settings for anything and everything I'd like. There is no comparison on iOS, jailbreaking enables but a fraction of what is possible on Android. 

5. ""Specs"": Now I put specs in quotations for a reason. On a spec level, flagship Android device blow iOS devices out of the water. This doesn't necessarily mean iOS is slow, as we all know it's not. I don't put much weight on the CPU or RAM, as the experience on iOS is speedy, and it works well despite having much lower specs. The area that I do miss however, is having an HD screen. I don't think 2K is necessary at this point in time, but a 1080p screen I do miss having. With the smaller screen size of iOS, even a 720p screen would suffice well. But for the newest device, to not even have a HD resolution, that takes a point off for me. I do think the ""Retina"" display looks nice, but if the iPhone 6 is larger, I would hope for an HD resolution. 

6. Onscreen buttons/Physical buttons: With Android you have the choice in choosing a phone with onscreen buttons, or choosing a phone with physical buttons. I prefer onscreen buttons for several reasons. Onscreen buttons can follow the orientation of the phone, so if I'm holding my phone upside down my home button is still in the same location. I also change in and out of apps much more than a typical user, and as such I've enabled touch assist on my 5s.


Same as any opinion, these obviously are my own, and several of these could be different if you held a different opinion. 

Bottomline: I'm switching. At this point in time, iOS fulfills more of my needs than Android, but if that changes in the future, perhaps I'll switch back. I chose the title to mirror the other post, but honestly, I'm neither an Android fanboy, nor an Apple fanboy. I choose the device that is best for me.

The Apple logo right in the middle really waste a whole lot of space and doesn't really work well especially with the requirement of the reddit alien to also be present.

apple,The 128GB MiniDrive - Something I got for my Macbook Air and I'm enjoying it.,"Hey guys,

So I have a Macbook Air with the 128GB SSD. I'm currently working on a big project and the disk space I usually have available has run out. 

On Monday I started looking for options. Basically I could get another external hard drive I would have to carry or I could look for an SD card. Researching this I stumbled upon [The MiniDrive](http://www.theminidrive.com/). 

They have two products. One is basically a MicroSD to SD adapter that fits flush in the SD slot in your MacBook Air, MacBook Pro or your MacBook Retina. 

Their other product is a small SD card that fits flush in the SD slot. I liked this instead of simply buying an SD card because I don't have to eject it and remove it every time I have to move from where I am. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are various models because the SD card slots vary. Here are all of their products, http://www.theminidrive.com/collections/all

&amp;nbsp;

**Customer Service**

So I decided to contact them on Monday because I was thinking of buying their adapter and couldn't find anywhere if the SD slot in my MacBook Air is a SDHC or SDXC. They emailed me back to confirm it was an SDXC and that it could indeed support the higher memory MicroSD cards. 

They also told me about a red adapter they had and one with integrated memory. That the one with the integrated memory was faster than simply using a MicroSD and the SD adapter. I told them that I was checking the red one, but if the one with the integrated memory was faster, I would have to check. I also asked why it was faster. 

They answered me and gave me some numbers. Basically it comes down that they have more space than a MicroSD and that way they could fit a more stable and far faster chip. 

Here are the numbers: 

&amp;nbsp; | Peak Speed Read | Peak Speed Write | Average Read | Average Write
---------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------
SanDisk 128GB MicroSD | 30 MB/s | 20 MB/s | 15 MB/s | 10 MB/s
128GB MiniDrive | 90 MB/s | 60 MB/s | 45 MB/s | 30 MB/s


They replied telling me that, while they're not selling this adapter yet, they are thinking of producing a red adapter with integrated memory and they had one around that they could sell one to me.

This was really nice of them. I told them that once I got it I would make sure to try it out and get some numbers and maybe post them here.

&amp;nbsp;

**Packaging**

https://imgur.com/a/58TAA

Not much to say, this is how it came. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Tests**

With everything I get I try it out and do some tests. With everything that I'm using to store data, I make sure I fill it a couple of times and do some tests on writing some files into it.

Well, after doing that, everything seems fine so I decided to take some numbers.

Using `dd` to write a 1GB file from /dev/zero with a blocksize of 1MB took 41.82 seconds. This comes out to an average of 25675627 bytes per second or 24.49 MB/s. 

https://i.imgur.com/bjwhzcF.png

Now, using `cat` to read this 1GB file and redirect it to /dev/null, it took 23.8 seconds. This comes out to an average of 45115203 bytes per second or 43.03 MB/s.

https://i.imgur.com/iQhnJM8.png

I don't know how to measure Peak Read and Write. If anyone could point me in a direction to find out how to do it, that would be wonderful and I could test it out.

https://imgur.com/a/7v51l

&amp;nbsp;

**Impression**

I'm very happy with the product and the company.

 Their customer service is fantastic. In all, I think they've written to me 12 emails answering everything I could ask. 

I told them I was thinking of posting this here and they decided to create a *coupon* for $15 off [any 128GB MiniDrive](http://www.theminidrive.com/collections/minidrive-128-models) using *reddit15*. ^\(Hope ^you ^all ^enjoy ^it... ^I ^didn't ^have ^that)

***Edit***

They emailed me and told me about another coupon they made available. 

It's for 15% off the *capped MiniDrive adapters*. (The ones that allow you to use your own MicroSD).

The coupon code is *reddit15%*. and it's for these, 

http://www.theminidrive.com/collections/minidrive-capped-microsd-adapters 

~~I think... I'll email them and confirm the link.~~ Confirmed.

***End Edit***

The MiniDrive is working great. I'm in the process of moving some folders into it and creating symlinks back in their original places.


If you have any questions to me, let me know. If you have any questions about the product, maybe I have something in my emails, if not I could ask or put you in contact with them. 

If you want me to test something out, let me know and I'll try it out.",80,116,2014-06-27,AAPL,0.033520907163619995,0.922987699508667,0.043491337448358536

apple,There is NO EVIDENCE that Apple is working with Adobe to transition Aperture users to Lightroom,"If you see the articles claiming that Apple is working with Adobe to transition users to Lightroom, they're all claiming that based on a quote from [TechCrunch](https://web.archive.org/web/20140627180135/http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/27/apple-to-cease-development-of-aperture-and-transition-users-to-photos-for-os-x/) (from the Internet Archive's Wayback machine):

&gt;*In addition, it is working with Adobe to work on a transitional workflow for users moving to Lightroom.*

But the original [TechCrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/27/apple-to-cease-development-of-aperture-and-transition-users-to-photos-for-os-x/) has been edited to remove that quote. A new statement at the bottom of the article reads:

&gt;*Article updated to clarify that there is no official workflow for migrating to Lightroom.*

They also include a new note about Adobe's intentions to help Aperture users migrate, but Apple has said nothing about that:

&gt;*Adobe says that it will ‘double down’ on Lightroom support and offer Apple users a way to migrate*

A lot of speculation about Apple's photo efforts has been attached to the original misquote. To remind you, all Apple has said is this:

&gt;*With the introduction of the new Photos app and iCloud Photo Library, enabling you to safely store all of your photos in iCloud and access them from anywhere, there will be no new development of Aperture. When Photos for OS X ships next year, users will be able to migrate their existing Aperture libraries to Photos for OS X.*

In any of the original sources ([The Loop](http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/06/27/apple-stops-development-of-aperture/), the modified [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/27/apple-to-cease-development-of-aperture-and-transition-users-to-photos-for-os-x/) article, or even [Aperture Expert](http://www.apertureexpert.com/tips/2014/6/27/aperture-dead-long-live-photos#.U65iohbgCkI)), there is no mention of Apple working with Adobe. 

Therefore, **we have no idea about Apple's professional photo intentions beyond what they've said**. They are certainly not giving up on photos and handing Adobe a creative monopoly. All we know is that Aperture *as a supported product* will end after its update for Yosemite, and that Aperture libraries will be transitioned to Photos libraries. 

Basically, every article that quotes the original TechCrunch article should be changed.

iphone,"Group texts, the technologically challenged, and unintended consequences.","My brother and sister in law just had a baby. They decided to send a mass text to members of both sides of their family with updates. They specifically asked that people not reply to the mass texts, but we all know how people follow simple rules. 

I am now getting replies from people I obviously don't know, as well as replies from middle-aged, android or flip phone users. While now aware that they just became a grandpa or great aunt, they are not aware of group recipients and how mass texting works. 

The group text has gone from a joyous celebration of birth to two strangers making threats and demanding they stop texting each other. Neither are aware they are replying to a group text everyone can see, neither are aware that the other was replying to a group text, an neither want to admit fault. 

Grandpa with a jitterbug: that's so great very happy for you.

Cousin with Motorola Razr: who is this?

Jitterbug: this is Ronald, who is this? How did you get my number?

Motorola: You texted me first. I don't know a Ronald, stop texting me. 

Jitterbug: I didn't text you, you texted me. Who is this?

Motorola: I don't give out personal information. Stop texting me, you texted me first. 

Random relative with an iPhone: you guys are in a group message about the baby. 

Motorola and Jitterbug in unison: Who is this? Stop texting me. How did you know about my Grandchild/cousin's daughter? Leave me alone!

apple,Apple Maps now gets updated every day at 3:00am Eastern,"Last week, I posted **[this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/28nkez/apple_maps_is_finally_improving_poi_data_and/)** about how Apple Maps has finally begun improving its POI data and even implementing user corrections in a fast and timely manner. Many people noticed the same thing, and MacRumors even **[wrote a story](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/06/21/apple-maps-poi-improving/)** about it. After two years of seeing virtually no progress on POI data, it seems Apple has finally built up the underlying infrastructure to start analyzing and correcting map data. As I said in that thread, I've seen more progress in the past few weeks than I had seen in the previous 2 years *combined*.


Anyways, I wanted to provide an update. Over the past month, Maps were being updated once a week (every Friday) for me, but now, that has improved further. Over the past few days, I've noticed an update occur **every single day at 3am Eastern**. At exactly 3am, Apple pushes out new data and corrects many of the problems that users had previously reported. For example, I noticed that if I open the app at 2:59 but then again at 3:01, the map would reload itself, and a bunch of POI corrections and updates would suddenly be present. Every day, a handful of corrections in my area are made (many of which are the ones I reported in the past week), and after just a few days of this, I'm starting to notice a real improvement in my area.

**tl;dr - Apple actually updates POI data now. If you see errors in your neighborhood, you can correct them with the 'Report a Problem' button on the Maps info screen. New data is pushed out by Apple's servers *every single day*, so the Maps app is now improving at a quick pace.**",184,807,2014-06-29,AAPL,0.07910698652267456,0.8757811188697815,0.04511186107993126
