apple,Pro Tip: Significantly Improve Bluetooth Audio Quality in Mac OS,"By increasing the Bitpool settings used for Bluetooth, you can greatly improve the quality of Bluetooth audio in Mac OS. The higher the Bitpool is set to, the less compressed the sound transmitted will be. We're changing the Bitpool to its max of 80; the default settings transition between a laughable Bitpool range of 4-64.

Note: you may need to edit the settings back to their default if you run into issues. On my 2012 Retina MacBook Pro the sound and connection were improved without even a stutter from these more demanding audio settings. The settings are reversible but proceed at your own risk.

Open Terminal, and type the following commands (you can just copy and paste):

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent ""Apple Bitpool Max (editable)"" 80

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent ""Apple Bitpool Min (editable)"" 80

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent ""Apple Initial Bitpool (editable)"" 80

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent ""Apple Initial Bitpool Min (editable)"" 80

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent ""Negotiated Bitpool"" 80

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent ""Negotiated Bitpool Max"" 80

defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent ""Negotiated Bitpool Min"" 80

Then reset your Mac. Boom, Bluetooth audio settings that prioritize quality.",93,398,2017-02-01,AAPL,0.08734770119190216,0.878058910369873,0.034593384712934494

* Searching archives in finder: These give me my first messages, but they're separated by date and converting them to one pdf seems impractical (unless there's another way of doing this?)

I figured Apple would have that on their stores, and just paid a visit just to double check and see what they could do.

The Genius comes back, and tells me, ""Well exjr_, hold on a few minutes, I am getting the replacement papers ready.""

The what? But isn't my computer being repaired? 

5 minutes later, she comes in with a brand new computer. Sealed box, everything new. Opens it, takes the new computer out, gives it to me, takes the old one and puts it back in the box. ""You are all set exjr_"".

I'm still lost, I didn't understand what happened for a second. 

She told me ""I noticed you are going to college, and as a programmer, you need your computer right away, so I convinced my manager to just replace you the computer with a new one on the spot.""

Lots of interesting details in the article. Here's an excerpt:

 ""Fanatical attention to detail is a key tenet. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone’s audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled.

Thus, each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site.

""The things you can’t see, they all mattered to Apple,” the former construction manager said.""

apple,Living with AirPods &amp; Apple Watch,"I've been using AirPods for a few weeks now, paired with my iPhone and my Apple Watch (and several non-Apple devices) and thought I'd share my experience so far for any who are interested. 

* **Battery Life** - I have not run out of battery once so far on the AirPods themselves, even though I use them pretty consistently throughout the day. When they're out of my ears, they're typically in their case and I can go several days without needing to charge the case itself. 

*  **Comfort/Fit** - As others have said, they're very comfortable and I don't feel like they're ever at risk of falling out. They do move a bit and require adjustment if you're working out and get a bit sweaty, but this isn't a huge deal. Being cord-free is absolutely amazing. One pet peeve of corded bluetooth earbuds is the rustling sound the wire conducts up to the earbuds as you move. Not having that or accidentally yanking a pod out of my ear is fantastic.

* **Aesthetics** - I wear these almost all day in the office and when I'm moving from place to place. They're very discreet and only one person has made a comment indicating that they knew what these were, which is fine by me. Not nearly as gaudy as when first-gen Bluetooth earpieces were all the rage. The case itself is a magnet for lint and has developed some light scratches but that's probably to be expected and is not really a concern.

* **Pairing with Apple devices** - An absolute breeze. Seamless. Only exception is with 4th Gen AppleTV, which requires manual pairing. Hopefully this is resolved soon.

* **Pairing with other devices** - Not a terribly complicated process. In most respects, this is easier than with other Bluetooth audio devices. One drawback I've found is that on my gaming laptop, it takes well over a minute for the AirPods to fully pair/connect and the audio is delayed and wonky for the first minute to two minutes of use. Need to remember to have volume low on your non-Apple device after pairing. I blasted my eardrums the other day and since non-Apple devices can't take advantage of W1, there's nothing stopping a loud burst of sound from potentially damaging a speaker (note: this is speculative but volume control seems more automatically intuitive on devices that can leverage W1).

* **Audio Quality &amp; Range** - The audio quality is a step above the EarPods but won't wow audiophiles who are used to extremely high quality headphones. They're better than average and are distortion-free but not as rich as you'll get on some other headphones in this price range. As far as the Bluetooth range, it is extremely impressive. I have walked more than 30 feet from my phone, into other rooms and have been separated by thick concrete walls and have never experienced a single drop or issue with the audio. This is the longest-range Bluetooth accessory I have ever used, hands down. 

* **Ease of use / functionality** - The stopping of playback when removing a pod is great and works *pretty* consistently. There are some times where the sensors don't work perfectly and they require a quick cleaning. If you have an iPhone, you may be used to this in regards to the sleep/wake proximity sensor sometimes getting confused if there is a smudge or some oil on it. I almost never use the Siri tap feature, or Siri at all through the AirPods. For me, the tapping to activate is inconsistent and it's also annoying having to invoke Siri for the simplest of tasks.


*That's where the Watch comes in. The Apple Watch is the most useful device for quick playback control. From ""Now Playing"", you're able to change tracks, playlists and most importantly for me, increase or reduce volume using the Digital Crown. It is my hope that future WatchOS updates will allow for the Digital Crown to always control AirPod volume from the watch face screen. Maybe having Now Playing reincorporated into the Control Center or allowing for a button to be assigned to ""Next Track"" or something of that nature could be implemented.* 

Overall, AirPods are pretty significant in that they are a first generation product with very few sacrifices. The ""early adopter tax"" is pretty low for these and I can't wait to see how truly wireless headphones evolve over time. We're off to a great start.",161,592,2017-02-08,AAPL,0.05103445425629616,0.919848620891571,0.029116932302713394

AppleWatch,Spotty (for Spotify &amp; AW) is now called Snowy. An update on the public release.,"Thanks for all of the support over the past month. For those who aren’t in the loop, these links may help: [Website](https://spotty.rocks) | [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/06/spotty-offline-spotify-app-playback-apple-watch)

## Not so good news
Earlier this week I was contacted by Spotify’s representatives who expressed some concerns about the app. I’m currently working with Spotify to resolve these issues prior to release, one of which requires rebranding the app. As a result, Spotty is now officially called “Snowy”.

**Unfortunately this means the app won’t be released until Spotify is satisfied.**

You might be wondering about the name as well. The app has been reskinned and may undergo additional design modifications as needed: **http://imgur.com/a/IGjRW**. The site will also be redirected to snowy.rocks in a few days.

## Good news
On a more positive note, this past week Spotty/Snowy was featured in 9to5Mac by Jeff who put together a great [hands on video and write-up of Spotty/Snowy](https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/06/spotty-offline-spotify-app-playback-apple-watch).

Finally, the Spotty/Snowy [fundraiser for the Harmony Project](https://www.gofundme.com/spotty-for-charity-harmony-project) surpassed $200. A big thanks to everyone who’s contributed so far.

apple,Does anyone else wish iOS was just a little bit more customisable?,"Yeap, it's that thread again. People have wrote it before but now it's my turn. 

I just want to open my thread by saying that I've used iOS devices since 2010 and I'm really happy with my iPhone. I'm not dissing iOS or Apple, but I also want to make it clear that I'm not a fanboy either. It's close, but it's not a perfect system. One thing that bugs me about iOS is how un-customisable it is. 

I'm not asking for icon packs or anything like that. I'd just really love the opportunity to be able to choose where my icons go on my home screen and not have to have that big wall of apps and maybe the ability to choose my default apps. I know that it's possible to do this with jail breaking, but I don't see why Apple hasn't allowed this out of the box. And, likewise, I know that Android does this, but Android has its own issues that really put me off from jumping over to Samsung or Pixel.

apple,Why can't we interact with Siri on the phone without the UI taking over the screen? Seems Siri should be the spirit of the phone that gets me answers / does stuff for me all while I can keep going what I'm doing.,"*(Damn it meant to say ""doing what I'm doing"" in the title-shouldn't have been typing on phone while sleepy, typos like whoa...)*

There have been a number of times that I've been doing something, and wanted to look up little extra info about something or another. Some information that I knew I could get from Siri. But, I didn't do use Siri because I also knew I would have to stop doing what I was doing, summon Siri, ask my question, deal with the fact that I can't do anything with the answer it gets back to me (because you can't copy and paste from Siri!), and then I'd have to switch apps back to whatever I was doing before. 

If I was actively typing something, I'd have to stop typing, reading stop reading, etc. - that's suboptimal.

Like I said in the title, I feel like Siri could be recast as the ""spirit of the iPhone (or whatever she is running on)"". So she could have control or awareness of of all non-windowed interfaces on the screen (and maybe some of the running apps too if devs allow API access and give good data). You should be able to say things like, ""set a timer in the top right corner of the screen for X time"". I don't want open the app for a timer, just show me that a goddamn timer has been set - I don't want to fucking see the countdown for fucks sake, I just want to know it will alert me at the end. Or I should be able to say ""add the opening paragraphs from the wikipage on San-Francisco to this doc"" while writing, or ask Siri to add the population of Papua New Guinea to the text I'm writing, or ask Siri to find a phone number and copy it to me clipboard... all without seeing the Siri app. 

It's just weird to me that Siri exists in this totally separate box, and that if I ask her for a timer I have to have her open up the whole Timer app - especially when this interruption is just to show me **numbers counting down**. I don't need to be interrupted from what I was doing to see this:

https://imgur.com/a/zwtIL

On my computer running macOS, I should be able to ask what color the VPN icon is to find out on my computer whether or not VPN connected - and I want her to understand the meaning (maybe this has to be added by the user, maybe by the dev) that the red icon means disconnected, and that's yellow is connecting, the names of the apps for every icon running run the menu bar, hiding and showing windows, controlling notifications, etc. She should be able to control the screen, the sound, outputs... It would be an easy way to add Siri interaction with apps that don't actually support it if you could ask things about how apps on the screen look.

Siri as an app made little sense, but it was what it was. Siri as OS layer, going forward, seems natural. 

I really hope that we find out soon that they have spent time allowing Siri to tie into the entire macOS and iOS API stack, and that it is all documented and ready for developers. I can envision how there could be some really cool things you could do with Siri if it worked in the same vein as the Automator / AppleScript (which might be getting deprecated).

I want to be able to say (or script): 

 &gt; Siri, when I say ""am I connected to VPN"", look at the menu bar at the icon for the VPN software, and if it is **green** say **yes**, **red** say **no**, and **yellow** say **connecting**. 

You could theoretically do this whole script just with words and clicks on the screen in Mac OS - no actual scripting. And Siri on my phone should know what ""my computer"" is if both are signed into iCloud and I should be able to interact with things on my computer or phone from the other device. 

But everything is siloed and useless.

Edit: I just thought of another. It would be really great on iOS if I could ask Siri why a certain app failed, and she could even give me the option of sending it to devs if that information is available. There's no verbose error reporting on iOS - things just frustratingly fail. Would be nice if Siri could navigate the hidden filesystem and check an app's run logs.",235,2409,2017-02-16,AAPL,0.04372689127922058,0.9257375597953796,0.030535496771335602

iphone,"After owning a Google Pixel XL for 4 months, I made the switch to an iPhone 7+","Hey everyone, I thought I'd share my personal opinion and thoughts on owning the Google Pixel XL for 4 months and switching over back to the iOS side with an iPhone 7+. I'm just a regular average consumer who enjoys his tech slightly more then the other 'more average' consumer. 

For the record, I've owned numerous of iOS/Android devices in the past but ultimately still think that iPhones have that sweet spot for me and this is what I noticed.. In no particular order

**Google Pixel XL**: 

- I love how much smarter Google assistant is. If I say ""Ok google, play Linkin Park songs"" it will immediately, where as on iOS it thinks I'm nuts. 
- I love how sleek the OS feels now, the notification shade bar and minor customizations triumph on iOS design right now in my opinion. 
- Having a headphone jack is actually a lot more useful then I realized. 
- Being able to set other apps as first party apps is awesome.
- Google ecosystem is buttery smooth on this phone. (as expected)
- Usb-C as I was already invested in a lot of usb-c peripherals.
- Fast charge !
- Android pay ! (Only 1 bank offers Apple pay in AUS). 
- No iTunes.

**iPhone 7+ PROS**

- iMessage, oh how I missed it. 
- Waterproof is not a necessity but its comforting to have.
- Hardware just feels more premium built. 
- Haptic engine is un-matched.
- I actually prefer the display on the iPhone, it feels brighter and more colourful despite the higher specs and amoled on Pixel. 
- Siri actually responds unlike Google on the first time. Google usually takes me 2-3x and was plagued with a recent update. 
- Having an Apple store near me is just comforting to know and have. Apple service is top notch. 
- SO MANY ACCESSORIES FOR IPHONES. Seriously, the only thing Google first party sells is like 3 cases and they are all absolute garbage ! 
- Much longer software support, I was super disappointed when Google announced only 2 years of support, and after seeing Nexus 6P users get left in the mud plenty of times its even more worrying. 
- Way better speakers. 
- **BATTERY LIFE**. My god. For the first time, I've had my iPhone run for 2 entire days straight. I could never do this on my Pixel. 
- I struggle to find any Android watch that competes with the Apple watch in terms of fitness/functionality/aesthetics.
- Mac integration is top notch and as well with other Apple products, while it also still interacts fine with Google made products too like the Chromecast. 

I think both phones are amazing, but considering they are dollar to dollar, I just think the iPhone is an overall better package, it just feels a lot more *refined* and when I'm spending $1,269 AUD on a phone I'd better be sure to get the best out of my dollar. To be honest I'm quite surprised, right now it feels like ""The software is better on Android but the hardware is better on iPhones"" and if you told me this three years ago I would have laughed and said its the complete opposite, funny how times change. I've always loved Android phones for many reasons and one of those reasons were *price-tag*, now that it matches the exact same dollar, that point just contradicted its self and I can no longer justify it.. The other reason was customizability and for the AVG consumer, the main difference really was just moving shit around the home-screen, it feels pretty limited compared to something like OxygenOS on the OP3, unless you want to get your hands dirty and start tweaking/custom-roms etc which the avg consumer WONT do.

So I try to keep it fresh, mixing up my wallpaper, moving around my apps. Just doing little things can make it feel more exciting. I like to be excited about my tech. Does anyone else feel this way? 

Like they need to switch stuff up on their phones so they can feel a sense of new excitement? I crave the launch day high I get with new products all the time. (Yep, I'm the awful always-upgrader).

What do you do to keep your phone feeling fresh?

At the end of the article, it mentions how the devs have two logical choices, either drop support entirely, or move to the Mac App Store, charging a small fee to recoup the $100 they'd have to pay yearly.

apple,Speed up your Time Machine backups tremendously.,"###TLDR:

Speed up backups at the expense of CPU utilisation:

    sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0

Go back to default after backup is done:

    sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=1

-----

###More details:

I only plug in an external harddrive to backup my MBP once every few days (no NAS, no Time Capsule etc). It was taking forever. According to the Activity Monitor, backup was going at a mind-boggling 1.5MB/s on average. A small backup of ~10GB would take hours.

Essentially Time Machine backups run at low priority so as not to interfere with (i.e. slow down) your regular work. If your backup drive is constantly plugged in, or available over the network, this is great. If, however, you only plug in once in a while like I do, or are making a first-time huge backup, you might want to speed this up.

So fire up your Terminal.app and paste the first command from the TLDR section above. You'll have to enter your account password, and you'll see a confirmation:

    debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled: 1 -&gt; 0

The change is immediate, no need to log off or restart. If you check your Activity Monitor CPU and Disk sections, you'll note backupd using a lot more CPU, and the disk activity to be much higher. You'll also see your Time Machine time remaining to backup lower drastically.

**Once your backup is done, don't forget to run the second command from the TLDR section to revert the change, else your machine may end up noticeably slower for everyday tasks.** 

Hope that's useful to those of you in the same situation I was in.

apple,"2 months of the 2016 MacBook Pro TB, surprises and knowns","So I am two months into a MacBook Pro TB. I didn't want to buy this machine but I had two dead MacBook Pros and needed to replace them with something. I am in some ways pleasantly surprised and in other ways disappointed as I thought I would be, and in other ways disappointed in surprising ways.

Pros:

1. The weight. I was in the camp of ""don't make it thinner, I don't need it, I want my ports."" I still want my ports. But after two months when I pick up my old MacBook I feel like I am being transported back to 1996. After you get used to this it's very hard to go back. So it defied my expectation and surprised me positively.

2. The sound. People reported better sound and again the quality is like night and day. Watching movies and Netflix on this, I don't feel like there is a sound compromise [edit: compared to more robust desktop speakers] at all. Even though I knew this was a bonus, it still surprised me with how good it was.

3. Not a surprise, but the machine is quieter, less fan noise, runs cooler than older MacBook pros. I specifically took the lower frequency chips this time, I usually pick the higher power / higher cost ones and I end up with a red hot MacBook. Also those forever-hot MacBook pros end up with dead keyboards, dying above the CPU. So I think this is a good choice both for comfort and longevity.

4. peripherals (hard drives) do seem to run a lot faster hooked up to this machine compared to the older machines. Time Machine backups complete a lot quicker as do copies. I don't know if this is the SSD or the USB slots to credit for it. Or a bit of both. 

5. The big touchpad I hated as a concept. I am both pleased and unhappy with it now. The pleasing part is that the touchpad size means I can keep my right hand more to the right hand side of the machine while manipulating the mouse. So it's not that I need the big area to do anything special, it just saves me from pushing my hand to the center of the machine and I get to use my hand at a more comfortable angle.

Cons:

1. However the huge size of the touchpad means 5-10 times per day a palm hit registers and I lose text as I'm typing, have to scroll to find where I was and fix things. It's annoying as hell. As well I am unconsciously adjusting so having to cock my left thumb a lot higher than I would be and I have a lot of pain in my left thumb as a result that is not going away. It is an RSI nightmare. The big touchpad nets out as a big loser in my eyes. It's terrible for me.

2. The keyboard at first feels better but there are big issues with it. First is that my hands are killing me. One hour into the day and I'm having to stop and massage my hands. I'm in constant pain. Fingertips and back of the hands. Typing accuracy is way down, and the reason for this is the bigger keys start blending into each other and it's easier to miskey than on older keyboards. It's less forgiving in every way possible. Trying to go back on an older bluetooth keyboard is hard to adjust to now as those keys feel like they are a mile high and made of marshmallows, but the magic keyboard is a nice middle ground between the two (plus has an escape key). The lack of escape key is also terrible. I can hit this escape key on the touchbar without looking but since there is no feedback I really don't know what is going to happen after this. This is not a professional's keyboard by any length.

3. Screen. This is a con for sure. I was surprised as I thought it would be a bonus. The problem is that the contrast is so very, very high. If I go to Youtube and I want to watch a video, I need to turn the brightness up to max otherwise the video is all shadows and darkness. When doing this the white background of browser, email, etc. becomes blindingly painful. I've had to install Stylish and change CSS for frequently used websites (including reddit) to get rid of white backgrounds as otherwise I'm going blind from the white and can't see stuff in the shadow ranges. Now, the detail and definition is there in the shadows its just that I can't look at that at the same time as being blinded. If I go full screen everything seems fine as those ultra-whites are not being hit. Previously I could just set brightness and work for my work period. Now I'm constantly having to micro-manage brightness based on my context. This is very bad. Also the native white point is decidedly blue-green... way far out from where it should be. This makes the contrast problem even worse.

4. USB-C: this is a nightmare for me. First, apple delivers a kick to the nuts in that its bundled USB-C cable is a USB-2.0 cable. I was shocked to find that out. But it is only good for USB-2.0 speeds. Now why in the hell make these super fast ports and brag about it, then deliver a cable that can't deliver USB 3.0 speeds, let alone 3.1 or Thunderbolt speeds, but is a throwback to 10 years ago. And we have no idea looking at any particular cable, just what it's good for, unlike previous USB cables (blue inside meant you're good for high speed). That is so un-apple in my eyes, but is definitely the Apple of the era where your phone won't plug into your laptop anymore. The positioning of the ports is a mess: they are too close so that adaptor dongles take up too much space and crowd each other out. At best you can put in one adaptor dongle and one USB-C plug side by side. There was no need for this. It makes plugging and unplugging things harder than it otherwise would be as well. Older cables or those with dongles to attach, these combined with the tiny USB-C plug generate a lot of torque on the socket. I don't see how these sockets are going to last a year let alone three. The old ports were large enough and more structurally sound that they were secure from this kind of problem.

5. Moving the audio from left to right is a change for the sake of change, and putting it behind but very close to the USB ports makes it hard to plug in (can't see the open port due to obscuring by USB cables, and when removing it you need to get your hand around the USB cables). It's just awkward and bad design from the company who used to make everything slick.

3. Touchbar: a useless terrible gimmick that reduces my efficiency by taking away hard keys. The volume, brightness and keyboard brightness keys were my only use for that row previously. Changing any of the above is less efficient now. Sometimes there is a bit of guesswork involved. Though I know it is there and I can see it changing peripherally by context, there is no need for me to ever use it. Word correction? Oh please. I miskey with my right hand when I index finger into the number row. Previously with hard keys this would not ever register as my middle finger would just touch without registering (I never even knew this). Now of course just brushing the touchbar causes bad things to happen like volume up/down mute on/off brightness on/off. If I could just turn this thing off completely I would do it. I have never used a scrubber and I don't feel it's more accurate at all than doing this onscreen. 

Overall after this much time it is a very highly compromised design that puts form ahead of function, to the point where form is obscuring function and hindering function. 

My eyes hurt.

My hands hurt. 

Stuff won't plug in easily.

Input is compromised. 

But if you are going to park the machine and *look* at it instead of *use* it, it is really really good. All of the problems with this computer come from using it. 

And that's not the way it should be. 

I'm hoping at least my hands will adjust and stop hurting so much, but as for now, I'm in agony. Screen I am playing with and maybe have some hope for.",167,208,2017-02-21,AAPL,0.09518156200647354,0.872141569852829,0.032676855102181435

Got to the car and checked the time, but noticed the ‘no phone connection’ icon on the watch. Looked for it, and then realized I left it in the locker room. Ran back into the gym to get it, and it wasn’t in the locker, but the watch was picking it up again. 

Pinged the phone from the watch and heard the sound from the other side of the lockers. Walked over, pinged it again, and a young guy pulled my phone out of his coat pocket to see why it was making noise. I saw it, walked over and told him “Oh, thats my phone, thanks for finding it.” He looked at me, looked at the phone (and didn’t immediately offer it back, he looked like he was contemplating some reason to keep it). A few beats passed and I just took the phone out of his hand, gave him a stern look and said “thank you.” 

IDK if he would have turned it in as lost, or just kept it, but I’m glad I didn’t have to find out. 

Usually I just use the ping to find where I left it in the house, but it’s surprisingly loud and really helped in this situation!",37,208,2017-02-27,AAPL,0.050694387406110764,0.8331137895584106,0.1161918193101883

apple,Beats have terrible quality,"These products do not have a long lifespan. I have owned Beats Wireless headphones (early 2015) and a pair of Beats Tour (unsure of when I bought them, possibly late 2014).

The sound is fine on the headphones but the cushioning is so cheap. After about 1 year of use, the cushioning has fallen apart and is tearing at the seams.

The Beats Tour (in-ear buds) fared better than the headphones in terms of build quality however audio is no longer produced by one of the ear buds.

I have owned much cheaper headphones and in-ear buds in the past and they have had much longer lifespans.


Possibly considering buying AirPods but will hold out until the ear buds packaged with my iPhone wear out.",102,101,2017-02-27,AAPL,0.022561799734830856,0.8989244103431702,0.07851375639438629
