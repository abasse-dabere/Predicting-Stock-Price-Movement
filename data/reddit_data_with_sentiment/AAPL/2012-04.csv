I want an iPod classic rather than iPod Touch or nano because i have a very large music library and the storage capacity of other devices is not enough for me. I just can't justify the current asking price even for used ones seeing as the iPod hasn't really been updated since 2007, pretty much only plays music, and for a few bucks more you can get an iPod Touch. Does anybody know any other places I could search to find cheaper iPods?

Everyone in the US would be fine with China making those changes here, right?

Okay, so obviously no one would like that; so why are some people so convinced that Apple should be forcing American ideals onto an entire country? I understand a lot of good will come from Apple raising the bar on Chinese labour laws; but Apple doesn't make those laws, the Chinese government, people, and businesses do. Changing the pay rate of one company in China isn't something that can just be done with the flip of a switch and have no repercussions; it'd be like a Chinese company coming over to the US and determining that a select few companies here will suddenly be paid differently.

ipad,This is the best app for Porn,"Let's be honest. We all look at porn and many of us use the iPad to do it.

There are plenty of apps out there that password protect your photos and videos but they are usually way to obvious. Any app that can store media and asks for a password at launch is a dead giveaway that you have porn on this iPad! We need an app that hides that there is even password protected content.

Presenting [Private Albums](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/private-albums-photo-video/id384617809?mt=8) from Hedonic Software.

The good thing about this app that looks completely innocent when you use it normally. Just a great app to download and store documents.

The way it works is that you have to login to open your files. Default without password protect. The great things is that you can create hidden accounts that are only revealed is you tap with 3 fingers in the login window. So by default I have a guest account, my personal account with innocent files and my hidden ""System"" account that holds my porn collection.

Other features:

* Generic app icon and name (""Albums"")
* Hardware encrypt your files + exclude from backup
* Decoy passwords: Still won't show the files in a hidden account when login in with a decoy password instead of the real one
* Hack protection: delete the account or show the guest account when failed to login 5 times
* Organize files in folders + search functionality
* USB and Web transfer or transfer via Dropbox
* Boss mode: tap with 3 fingers to quickly show a generic Google map
* Expands archives (ZIP, RAR, CBZ and CBR)

There is also the [Stash](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stash-private-photos-videos/id364575517?mt=8) app that has a free version and adds a private browser but the ""st@sh"" name under the icon is a bit more obvious in my opinion.",43,52,2012-04-03,AAPL,0.032438162714242935,0.9365487098693848,0.03101307712495327

apple,How my Apple hate quite literally burned me,"Sooo... I’m  a fucking idiot. This is the medium length story as to why, and it’s a bit of an effort post, but I think it’s a cautionary tale as to why fanboyism is incredibly stupid and potentially physically harmful.

Maybe saying that I hate Apple is going a bit far, but post-iPhone they’ve annoyed me. I hate the commercials, I hate the culture of rumors and speculation, I hate the lining up for new devices and I really didn’t appreciate the canonisation of Steve Jobs.

OSX isn’t for me and iOS isn’t my favourite mobile OS, but one thing I’ve always been able to admit is that Apple is the best hardware manufacturer out there. Hands down, out of everything I’ve used, Apple products are seemingly the only ones to get all of the intangibles right. After hemming and hawing for months, in my search for a thin-and-light laptop I settled on a Macbook Air. It didn’t particularly feel great buying an Apple product, but it was the best machine out at the time for me. 

I ran Windows through boot camp as my primary OS and it ran incredibly well. 6 and a half hours battery life, full driver support, brilliant screen, and (my favourite part about the Macbook Air), it was dead silent. I *fucking hate* fan noise, and the Macbook Air kept the system cool with the faintest puff of air if I put my ear to the exhaust port. 

But still, it was an Apple computer, and despite the fact that it did everything I wanted it to do – HD movies, web browsing for hours, flawless document and image creation, movie editing, all of this without sounding like a jet taking off – I was still uncomfortable with the fact that I’d “bought in” and drank that particular Kool Aid. 

So, with the rise of “Ultrabooks”, I saw my way out. Again, let me emphasise, I am stupid. I thought I’d pick up a Macbook Air competitor for less money and stop feeling like a dick for having an Apple computer. This is the first key mistake.

The second mistake was the fact that you can’t actually buy a comparable setup to the Macbook Air without paying hundreds of dollars more. I bought the Samsung Series 9 900X3A-B06US, supposedly with a much faster processor (I had a 2010 MBA), supposedly with better battery life, supposedly a lot of things. I sold my Macbook Air, got the Series 9 and was happy with it for about ten minutes. Until the system heated up for the first time, the fan kicked in and I was treated to the sound of a thousand mosquitos fucking each other after being up all night on methamphetimes. 

It just wouldn’t shut the fuck up. I work in a quiet office, I live in a quiet neighbourhood, it drove me mental. That wasn’t the only thing – despite it being more expensive, the battery life was 2 hours shorter (on a machine that natively runs Windows), the SSD had a quarter of the space taken up by a useless recovery partition that requires the installation of three programs and 5 hours to remove, the screen is muddy due to a lower resolution and a matte screen that lacks clarity, it picks up fingerprints like my brother picks up ladyboys in Thailand, and it sounds like thousands of mosquitos fucking each other after being up all night on cocaine (I changed it up to keep you interested). 

I called Samsung and asked if there was anything I could do about the aforementioned fan noise. They directed me to a system option named “Silent Mode”, which raises the fan temperature thresholds and downclocks the CPU to keep the laptop quiet. Cool. My savior. Despite the fact that it was now essentially a netbook with an 800MHZ processor, it was quiet. 

What they didn’t tell me was that part of the system’s cooling mechanism involves disappating heat through the bottom panel of the laptop, made of a flimsy sheet of powder coated aluminium. This, combined with sitting down to write a long report on my couch, meant pain. 

After a few hours of word processing in “Silent Mode”, I stood up for a stretch, and hoooly fuck did it hurt. The undertray of the Series 9 had scorched the tops of my knees through my jeans, and for the next few days it felt like bad sunburn. I’d checked the CPU temperature and it never got past 52C, but I started reading around – as one review put it, “""the underside sees temperatures that are best reserved for hot asphalt rather than a notebook. We can’t put this more delicately: when its processor is pushed, the Series 9 can become a dangerously hot nut roaster. "" 

I don’t know how hot it got , but it was hot enough to burn my fucking legs, all while I was word processing. 

So I called Samsung and said, hey guys, I tried out this “Silent Mode” thing, and it burned my fucking legs. “Ah,” they said. “There’s your problem. You’re not supposed to use your notebook on your legs.” I know that the manuals of all notebooks say that, but I’ve never encountered one hot enough to make that warning a threat. I used to perch my Macbook Air on top of me for up to eight hours on days off, watching HD video, and the only effect would be slight warmth from the heatsink in the top left. 

**The Lesson, Dear Reader:** Thanks for sticking with me through that. I guess what writing this is my analysis of how fucking retarded being beholden to a particular product truly is, especially when it comes down to something like advertising and marketing ethos. The Macbook Air is, quite seriously, the best computer I’ve ever used. Maybe it’ll be eclipsed, maybe we’ll end up in a post-PC world, but for now there’s nothing that does what it does as effortlessly and (quite literally) painlessly. 

Apple haven’t just crammed in hardware without giving a fuck, they’ve carefully considered the thermal dynamics and cooling solutions to such an extent that I actually began to take how cool and quiet it was for granted. You can buy similarly specced Windows notebooks for less, but I can now see why they cost less – they’re bigger, hotter, louder, but it’s more than that. It’s about the intangible things – Apple’s begun to make computers so good you needn’t worry about anything other than the task at hand. 

Maybe some of the millions of people who profess to love Apple products do so because they’re slavishly devoted to savvy marketing and a trendy brand image. Maybe the people commenting on Engadget about how shit everything else is actually exist. But I’ve learned through painful experience that the reason most people love Apple is because they make rock solid products that don’t burn your motherfucking legs.",452,858,2012-04-05,AAPL,0.05477956682443619,0.9127711951732635,0.03244929015636444

I have purchased my iPad from them and they seem to be a legit Apple authorized reseller. They have Apple banners/advertising material everywhere.

I used windows for years and always felt running AV was essential to maintain the health of the system (although this was with windows versions 3.1 -&gt; XP) I'm sure 7 is quite robust.


Do you think it necessary to run AV?
Am I right in thinking that even these days with a Mac you can't get a virus/trojan from just visiting a website the way you could with windows and that infection still requires the user to click OK on some dodgy install window?

Because if automatic infection is possible on a mac at this point (ie without having to click OK to some installer or some codec) then I guess AV is required, and I Love that I don't need AV on OS X,

I believe a system probably has 10-15 % better performance without realtime AV slowing it down, (could be wrong on this stat but it's how it used to feel with apps like norton and McAfee on windows.",140,36,2012-04-09,AAPL,0.059991881251335144,0.9041794538497925,0.03582865744829178

So I've done some research for replacements and so far came up with:

* [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) for Photos,
* [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) as an iDisk replacements (in fact it's much better than iDisk) and
* [fruux](http://fruux.com) as an replacement for contact, calendar and task synchronization.

While I am a big fan of Apples highly integrated approach I've begun to see the benefits of using third-party services, too: I am able to use these tools on my Windows machine at work and my Android tablet, too - thats quite nice.

Basically I was noticing that I didn't have much HD space left despite not knowing what might be using it up.  I used [Disc Inventory X](http://www.derlien.com/), (a free and godly program that deserves a reddit post of its own) to just have a look at what all was on my comp.  I found a huge chunk of space being taken up by something I didn't recognize.  Dug a little deeper and saw that for some reason iTunes had made like 7 or 8 backups of my iPhone at different times and at different sizes.  I have no idea why this would have happened, but I backed up, deleted the unnecessary ones, and low and behold I freed up ~40 gigs of space.

Hey guys, my first game, [Polymer](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/polymer/id499490016?ls=1&amp;mt=8), released today. I did all the programming, music, and art, and I'm super proud of myself. It's already rising pretty quickly in multiple countries' charts. Also, it's 50% off for launch!

I thought you might be interested in my journey from someone who literally knows **nothing** about programming to a published game developer. I know that this type of post would have been really helpful for me when was just getting started. Hopefully I can inspire someone in a similar situation!

**THE STORY**

About a year and a half ago, I decided that I wanted to make a game. There was a problem though. A big problem: **I hadn’t programmed a day in my life.**

I always thought it would be pretty sweet to be a game developer but it was so out of reach that it never felt like a realistic goal. But one day in October of 2010 I just decided to go for it. I had nothing to lose so why not?

I learned bits and pieces of a bunch of languages, including C, Python, ActionScript, and Objective-C. Honestly though, I really don’t think it matters too much what languages you learn on. If there is one piece of advice that I can share about learning to program, it is this: **PROGRAM A LOT**. There really is no other way to learn besides doing, doing, doing, doing, and doing again. Every time you make something new, you find a thousand things that you did wrong before. Every time, you chisel away at your horrible programming skills until you’re finally able to make something that you can be proud of.

Along the way I made a ton of stupid, fun, and weird mini-games to help me learn. I made:

* [A game about a man-rodent](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dtplj/thought_you_might_be_interested_in_my_very_first/) hiding in a town, attacking the townspeople
* [A text-based minesweeper clone]( http://youtu.be/Cn_Oibc4sjg) with a custom-sized board and mine-count
* [A game called Pizza Guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLumD97DX8), about a guy who had to (you guessed it) deliver a pizza while trying to jump over an endless barrage of pipes of varying heights. The only result was loss. There was no win.
* [A game called Party Man](http://www.whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1000000423.png), in which the the protagonist is driving along a grid, trying to reach a party. The problem was that my programming was still pretty bad at that point, so he kept literally crashing the party.
* [An app where you could create sequences of musical phrases](http://youtu.be/xWMsBGEwvbY) in the pentatonic scale
* [A flash clone of the classic snake game](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)
* [A flash clone of those driving-through-an-ever-shrinking-tunnel games](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)

Finally, I decided it was time to make a real game. Pretty much all of Polymer’s creation was iterative design. I never had an overall plan. I kept thinking, “I don’t know how to make a complete game. I just know how to make basic gameplay,” as if there were one way to make a game. But I realized I just need to make it however I could, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right or best way.

When I sent the game to beta testers, I was convinced that all I really needed to do was polish it up a bit. Oh man was I wrong. I had so many amazing suggestions from my testers that I just had to implement. I probably said, “I’ve only got one or two more things to add, then I’m done!” a thousand times.

Submitting to the app store was terrifying. I was so paranoid that I would forget something huge. Something that could break the game or get it rejected. But at the same time, it felt amazing. I finally did it. My creation, my baby, was done. I went from not knowing a thing about programming to finishing a game that I was very very proud of.

It’s already gotten some awesome previews on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/19/hands-on-with-whitaker-trebellas-polymer/), [Indie Game Mag](http://mobile.indiegamemag.com/looking-shapely-polymer-teaser-trailer/) and [Gamezebo](http://www.gamezebo.com/games/polymer/preview).

Of course, I hope Polymer sells well. But even if it doesn’t, I’m proud of myself for actually carrying this whole dream through. I’ve had trouble in the past making the journey from start to finish on big projects. Starting is easy. Finishing isn’t. Plus, programming Polymer has taught me so many amazing things. There’s a lot of really messy spaghetti code, but I honestly don’t care too much because it works. Next time I make a game I’ll be able to build upon what I’ve learned, and hopefully make something even more awesome. Until then though, I’m hoping for the best with Polymer. And I hope you enjoy it!

Posted the same about two weeks ago, but then took it off the app store while I chased down a fatal bug (found by a redditor!) that was in the app store version and not my development version.  (Turned out to be a known compiler issue).  Cleaned up a bunch of other stuff while searching for the fatal bug, so the result is significantly smoother.  Worth downloading the update if you got it the first time around.

(original post: http://redd.it/s8tcz)
App Store: http://itunes.com/apps/SecretDecoderRing

Original text:
My 9 yr old and I wrote a secret decoder app for the iPad with 4 different ciphers. I did 99% of the coding, but my son is the instigator, technical consultant, color scheme chooser, art director, and primary beta tester (he gets a huge kick out of finding bugs). The latest addition is a 3D Thomas Jefferson wheel cipher (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_cipher). Primary audience: kids that like secret codes and spy stuff.
I'm giving away copies, looking for suggestions and ideas for additional ciphers. If you have a kid that likes secret messages and you have an iPad, check it out: http://itunes.com/apps/SecretDecoderRing
I can give away 50 free copies, normally a buck. Shoot me a pm, first 50 get 'em.
