apple,The iOS music app is in a strangely dysfunctional place if you don't have Apple Music,"When Apple Music service was first released, the iPhone app took a hard step away from full control over my music collection to becoming a marketing tool for Apple Music. Which is fine but I really like my music, especially now that I can fit it all on my new $1200 iPhone. I turned off all the 'For You' and Apple Music integration that I could. I deal with the daily bugs but am also dodging the popups for up selling services too. 

A perfect example is in [This screen shot](https://imgur.com/a/xhd4r)
I bought this album on iTunes, then downloaded it, but iTunes offers the cloud versions mixed in. It does this for 100's of albums. It still offers the option of downloading the album for a second time, which would offer three of every song. If that isn't bad enough, clicking on the artists name doesn't bring you to the artist in your collection, or the iTunes store, it brings you to Apple music then asks if you want to upgrade. 

Meanwhile I really miss Genius Mix. 'For You' never got even close to genius mix quality. Is any one else sort of lost in between Apple's different music services? It's to the point were the music app is only good as access to the catalog but provides no improvements over the initial iOS 1 functionality, play, shuffle, repeat, with the addition of 'up next'.",414,2848,2018-04-01,AAPL,0.03356122970581055,0.9198289513587952,0.046609871089458466
apple,I got a new phone after using an iPhone 4 for eight years.,"My iPhone 4 served me very well throughout most of these years. It wasn't until some applications fell out of support (as of late last year) that I contemplated on replacing it.

&amp;nbsp;

The home button's double tap feature didn't function consistently during the last 3 years or so, but I used AssistiveTouch instead, and it worked very well.

&amp;nbsp;

However, the last straw for purchasing a new phone was when I began experiencing problems during recharge attempts -- as in it wouldn't charge at all. Being incapable of relying on whether or not it would be sufficiently energized when heading out, I decided to call it.

&amp;nbsp;

The length of service of my 8-year-old phone left me with an impressed ROI, so I decided to stay with the same brand. When I powered on its newer brother, I couldn't help but to feel slightly solemn as the iPhone 4 had been with me for so long. I hope my new iPhone 8 will serve me well.

*Ps.The two photos were taken using the same amount of lighting and the resolutions have not been altered. iPhone 4 photo was taken with the iP8, and vice versa. The protective cover on the picture is the one and only I used since I first got the phone in 2010.Ds.*


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT:** The charging issues are most likely caused by the charger, not the battery itself as I've had similar problems before. When wiggling the charging cable, the charging process either commences or interrupts. Buying a new charging cable resolved it in the past. I've gone through 3 chargers.

What I meant with the last straw was, instead of spending money on yet another charger, combined with not being able to use a lot of apps, and overall just wanting the experience of a newly designed product, I decided to get a new phone.

**EDIT II:** Wow! Over 1.6k upvotes. You guys are ~~nuts~~ apples. I'm glad you all took an interest in this, and I enjoyed reading your own cellphone stories. Thank you.

Several users have asked me why I didn't upgrade to the Plus or X-model. It was partly due to form factor but also budget restrictions.

Possible allusion to the fairy in Zelda, code name for future Apple product?","References to a new display output labeled “Tatl” have been discovered hidden in the PrivateFrameworks code of iOS 11.3 that were not present in 11.2.  


https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/979760720278679552  


`isTatlDisplay` (???)  
`isCarDisplay` (CarPlay)  
`isExternal` (AirPlay)  
`isMainDisplay` (main display of iOS device)  

“Tatl” appears to be a code name for a potential future Apple product, and a possible allusion to Link's fairy companion in *The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask*.

In the game, Tatl assists Link by allowing him to interact with the environment and give him information when looking at certain objects, people, and enemies.

apple,"After being an android fanatic for 8 years, I got an iPhone 8 Plus. The verdict? I absolutely love it","I've been an Android fanatic for about 8 years now. I had the Nexus S, HTC One S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 6P. I've been the typical Android fanatic. I rooted my phones, installed different kernels, installed different roms, customized my phones in every way possible. But as I got older, I realized that I don't have time for that now. I needed a phone that is just that, a phone and I had realized that Android wasn't at that state yet, even with version 8.1.

The thing that truly irked me is the fact that one always has to troubleshoot the phone in order to get the best battery possible. One cannot just install any app because they might go rogue and keep the phone from going on stand-by. Google Play Services draining the battery? Good luck finding the culprit app. You'll have to troubleshoot the phone as if it was a Desktop.

But that the thing, I no longer wanted troubleshoot my phone and customize it because frankly, I no longer have time. Therefore, I decided to get the iPhone 8 Plus and wow. I've been using it for 2 weeks and I'm completely amazed.

The iPhone 8 Plus is truly a phone. Not a Desktop computer but a reliable phone. One doens't need to worry about charging the phone because the stand-by time is phenomenal. One doesn't have to worry about an app going rogue because paradoxically, by being more restrictive, iOS gives more power to users regarding their apps. If I find an interesting app, I download it worry free, not having to worry about it going rogue and draining the battery.

All in all, I'm extremely happy by getting the iPhone 8 Plus. I don't miss the customizations because I've already been through that and right now, I just want to have a phone that I can rely on that the iPhone is that phone. All in all, I'm happy with the purchase and I'm happy that I became an iPhone user.",242,728,2018-04-04,AAPL,0.04304727911949158,0.9197956323623657,0.037157077342271805

apple,Two weeks in on the HomePod and I'm actually preferring Siri,"The general consensus on the HomePod has been that it sounds great but Siri is lacking. I don't think anyone was surprised by this and I don't think that it has deterred any of us from buying one. Additionally- my friends have even heckled my desire for a HomePod, citing the reviews of how bad Siri is, and I've let them know I'm interested in an excellent sound quality for $350 with the added bonus of being able to control my smart devices. 

Now, here is what I DIDN'T expect... I am *actually* preferring Siri to Alexa on my Echos. 
- Siri on the HomePod understands me better and responds more often (albeit occasionally a half second slower than Alexa would) 
- Siri seems to handle commands I want to use in a more human way (Siri can do ""turn off all the lights in the house"" with a zippy ""Done!"" but Alexa says  ""Sorry, I didn't find all lights house"" in her normal robotic tone) 
- a few of my devices are HomeKit only, so they cants be controlled my Alexa. I had been using my control center Home widget but now I can tell Siri what I want. 
- Apple Music integration is huge. I use the pair Bluetooth option with Alexa but Siri knows my playlists AND doesn’t hijack my phone audio.

I'm sure there will be those who disagree, and that's okay, but this has been my experience and I'm starting to think the HomePod naysayers are just grumps.",187,424,2018-04-06,AAPL,0.0373811274766922,0.9117264151573181,0.05089247599244118
AppleWatch,Went to the ER thanks to my Apple Watch,"I sleep with my Apple Watch on. Yesterday morning, I went to sleep at about midnight. Had some pretty good sleep until about 2am yesterday morning, when my Apple Watch woke me up with an elevated heart rate notification (I had forgotten to turn on Theatre Mode thanks to a long shift before). Waking up, I felt my heart racing incredibly fast and I couldn't get it to calm down. Looking at my watch, my heart rate was at 194, and had increasingly gotten higher a few minutes before. I tried for about thirty minutes to get my heart rate to calm down. I was feeling a few palpitations, and a lot of skipped beats. After waiting, my watch was reading my heart rate at 70 or 80 bpm, but my heart was still pounding in my chest. This didn't make sense at all. So, I went to the ER. Turns out I had an atrial fibrillation, where the top part of my heart was beating twice as fast as the lower part of my heart. Got transferred to a cardiac ward where they're trying to figure out what could possibly have caused it. The type of fibrillation I had wasn't normal for my age at all (I'm a teen), so I'm really proud that my watch caught it for me.

apple,Amazing Apple Watch Story,"My wife got a Series 3 watch a few months ago, and over that time, she's been literally and figuratively very attached to it.

Fast forward to yesterday, when we went to the community pool. After playing in the water with kids for about an hour, we left. That night, she realized her watch wasn't in her bag, where she thought she put it. She was worried, but thought it would turn up in the morning. Exhausted, she went to bed. The next morning, she still couldn't find it, and couldn't remember whether she was wearing it in the pool. She was worried she left it there.

So I went up to the pool, and looked at the water. And there it was: a 38mm Rose Gold Apple Watch, lying on the pool's floor. I jumped in and got it, thinking there was no way it could have survived almost 12 hours submerged in four feet of water. In my car, I pressed the power button, and boom: the Apple logo came on. But then it lingered longer than usual, and I thought it may not actually be working. But then, about two minuted later, the apps showed up and it launched. And it's been working as normal since.

apple,Just got a set of AirPods...,"I know these have been out a while but here are my thoughts for anyone that cares. I have to say, I’ve never been more satisfied with an Apple product since my original iPhone. 

If anyone’s on the fence, here is a layman non-techy type review.

I picked these up to replace a plantronics headset I’d had for a while that seems to have disappeared. I had been pretty happy with that unit and intended to buy another until I took another look at the AirPods. So, my review is basically weighed against that headset. 

Cost- at ~$160 I thought that seemed a bit high. However, for someone like me that uses a single bud at a time most of the time, I’m essentially getting 2 headsets for about $40 more than a replacement plantronics unit. That leads directly to the second advantage 

Battery life- I get about 5ish hours out of each earbud. That’s already better than the plantronics, but then, when it dies, I drop it in the case and pop the other in. No down time. That’s a huge plus for a guy like me that is operating remotely and on the phone all day. Then, since the case itself recharges the other bud in the case, I have PLENTY of power to work all day. I never could do that with the Plantronics.

Sound quality- the AP’s have far higher audio quality than the Plantronics. Call clarity is equivalent as well. None of my callers have complained about noise despite me talking from inside a jeep. Which is another thing- in noisy environments I can put both buds in which makes it easier to hear without having the volume at maximum.

Ease of use- open the case and go. Couldn’t be simpler. 


All in all, I’m thoroughly satisfied!",103,329,2018-04-11,AAPL,0.025445064529776573,0.9158567786216736,0.05869811773300171

apple,Just bought an 8 Plus after using a 5 for a while. It has really clicked why people love iPhones.,"Like the title says I just got an iPhone 8 Plus. Wow is this thing amazing. It makes me want to use my phone now, instead of using it when I need to use a specific function. It's (obviously) so much faster/smoother, things look nicer, apps work better, and I have storage. Notifications are easier to deal with now, and I can finally unlock with a fingerprint again instead having to type in a damn passcode (used to have a 6P so the iPhone 5 took some getting used to in this regard). Some of you guys may think it weird that I bought a new phone now, with the bezelled design. I think it looks great though. And I am okay with the LCD display as I plan on using this phone for like 5 years if I can. Maybe by then Apple will have switched to microLED (one can hope!).

SO yeah, the 8 Plus is awesome. I love Apple. Time to start saving for a watch, airpods, homepod, and macbook pro! I've been totally sucked in...",76,167,2018-04-11,AAPL,0.014070438221096992,0.8763024210929871,0.10962720960378647

MacBook Pro with graphics card failure, I have created the official guide to resurrecting it from the dead.","I was having the infamous GPU failure problems on my 2011 machine, and I stayed as persistent as possible in finding the answer. So, after doing approximately two months of research from multiple forums, Reddit posts, and videos, I have compiled all of the information I have learned together in order to make the most straight forward guide to fixing your laptop. Also no, this does not require baking your laptop in the oven and having the best five minutes of your life until it breaks again. This solution does not require taking out any parts or opening up the computer. Not only is it completely software orientated, but it is permanent too! Just follow the imgur link below from start to finish, and I really hope that the results work out for you!
https://i.imgur.com/xdBaVbu.png (The paragraph at the beginning of the tutorial might seem confusing. That's just because this guide is being taken out of context. Just follow starting on step 1 and you should be fine.)

**Additional things to note:**
This solution requires that the dead mac has MacOS Sierra and up installed as the operating system. If the hard drive's operating system on your dead mac is el Capitan or lower, I would recommend taking the hard drive out, installing Sierra or up on it from another mac, and then put it back in your laptop and then start the tutorial. Also, we are not bringing the dedicated graphics card back to life, but instead we are programming the computer to use integrated graphics. The good thing about this though is that you are guaranteed to not experience any colored artifacts, distorted colors, or kernel panics that prevent the computer from turning on when you use it. Also, if you want to update or reinstall MacOS, just follow the instructions that are also included in the image above.

This is the most updated version of the tutorial and I will try to make future adjustments if necessary. Thank you!",143,567,2018-04-17,AAPL,0.048269543796777725,0.9173209071159363,0.034409571439027786

iphone,I just got a e-mail from Tim Cook after thanking him,"So I just got a reply from Tim Cook.

It all started 19th February when after fighting
depression for a few months, my 87 year old grandmother passed away. I lived
with her and my mom for 25 years and she was an inspiration for both of us.

She was Italian and had to hide on the montains during WW2,
during which she managed to come to Brazil where she got married.

Since December we knew she was short on time so me, my fiancée,
my sisters and my mom did everything on our reach so she could get comfortable
and enjoy her days. We got the family reunited every weekend, we cooked
everything she liked, took a lot of photos of all of us and tried our best to
show her how much we loved and cared for her. 

Unfortunately, she passed away 10 days after my birthday, tomorrow
will be exactly 2 months, on her home, surrounded by her children. 

Since that happened, I lost most of my strengths, didn´t
want to get out of bed, stood on her old bedroom a lot and started taking anti
depressives.

Last week my sister went home and we started sharing photos
we had of her and I got a few I didn´t had. I never have my phone volume on,
but this day it was and as they all have iPhones, I 3D-Touched the photo to see
the LivePhoto and that´s when it hit me that the LivePhoto´s have sounds.

I guess it was the first time I truly smiled in this 2
months when I heard her laughing on this LivePhoto. She was so happy and
enjoying that day that I couldn´t stop watching this short video and the others
where she was talking. 

I heard cases when Tim Cook answers a few emails and decided
to send him this story, thanking him for the sound that is recorded on the
LivePhoto and explaining how much it meant to me and that it helped me a lot.

This is not the typical post here on /r/iPhone, but I wanted
to share with you guys the response I got and if some of you didn´t know
LivePhotos had sound maybe you get a good surprise sometime.

iphone,Is anyone else getting an influx of spam/scam calls lately?,"For the last month or so both my fiance and I have been getting a HUGE influx of spam and scam calls. We are talking multiple calls a day from people we don't know.


Most of the time they either don't answer or they want to lower my interest rate on my credit card or offer me a home security system. I've tried blocking the calls, but they always use a new one a few hours later. They also ALWAYS come from a local number. If I call or text the local number back, the person is always as confused as I am, meaning they are spoofing the numbers...


This is getting to the point where I want to find a way to send any unknown caller to voicemail automatically...

Or when netflix says ""hey bro you still watching"" if i could click yes from my phone instead of needing to get up and use my laptop, that'd be sick.  

What're your thoughts? I feel like with the connectivity airdrop uses, it should be trivial to send other commands.  It'd just be a matter of ensuring only verified devices could access the commands, but I feel like that isn't too difficult either, you just need airdrop-like connections between iCloud devices.

apple,Warning for 1Blocker users,"It seems like the guys behind 1Blocker are pushing a new app- 1Blocker X.

After many months of completely ignoring their original app, they have updated it so it now has a banner pushing you to the new app. Good thing, right? Since after months of the tracker list not being updated, what we wanted was an ad for the new app. 

With this new app, they don’t seem to have addressed any of the issues the old one had:

- Doesn’t seem to have auto-update of rules, so we are stuck in the same situation where we are waiting for them to manually update their proprietary lists.

- Doesn’t have a better business model. They either couldn’t support the app on a single one time purchase (or are just being greedy and trying to grab more cash). Either way, the same situation will arise eventually and they will be forced to abandon their shiny new app for an even newer one.

This is actually one of the app categories where I would be glad to pay a modest yearly subscription. Wish someone took Marco’s idea and used the Ghostery list, since that’s probably the best list out there.

AppleWatch,This watch changed my life - an update!,"So about a month ago I submitted [this post](https://reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/86qyl9/this_watch_changed_my_life/) in which I told you guys my experience with the Breathe app on the watch.  
The short version of this post is, I suffer from severe anxiety and PTSD, and this watch catches a panic attack before it hits, and neutralizes it using the Breathe app.  
One user suggested I send my story to Tim Cook, and so after a bit of deep breathing [I did!](https://i.imgur.com/WGcUld4.jpg)  
Not a day passed and the Apple Watch PR [contacted me via email](https://i.imgur.com/90CZ3DJ.jpg) thanking me for sharing my story. I was already amazed by the kindness she expressed.  
But when she [asked to personally talk to me on the phone](https://i.imgur.com/T08jlbj.jpg) I was just... blown away.
The phone call was so heartwarming. She wanted to thank me personally, told me that this is the first time they got an email about how the Breathe app specifically helped (and not the heart rate monitor, for example). She wanted to know how it helped to perhaps develop it into a better tool for PTSD and anxiety sufferers alike, which I find absolutely awesome!  
The interesting thing here is, previously I was sure the app followed the heart rate to pop a “take a moment to breathe” when it gets too high while resting. But from what she told me, the algorithm only follows the time when you’re “relaxed” (aka not physically active or on a call) and only then will it suggest that.  
It makes sense, anxiety builds up during activity. That’s why a panic attack is called an “attack”, it sneaks on you when you’re least expecting it- when you’re resting.  
  
TL;DR
The Apple Watch team are a group of sweet and awesome people, and the watch is an absolute must for people suffering from anxiety and/or PTSD. Hopefully my little email could move something bigger for the benefit of people like us!",35,350,2018-04-20,AAPL,0.020198775455355644,0.9069904088973999,0.07281085103750229

So then I say add purple rain to up next, and she adds the movie purple rain to the up next in the TV app. So I say after this song, play purple rain... she adds the fucking movie again. I ended up searching the song in my library and manually adding it to the up next queue.

apple,Don't be an idiot like me. Had my iPhone X stolen last night.,"Edit: [REDACTED INFO]

Police are already investigating.

Sob story: I was selling my iPhone because I needed money to buy a laptop for college. Now I cannot afford to. Instead it got stolen. Thankfully there were no weapons involved and nobody got hurt. 

Two things I learned: When selling an iPhone, don't iCloud Unlock it before the sale. And make sure the person actually has money to pay with before letting them hold the phone.

I met in a public area, but the person grabbed the phone and dashed into a neighborhood. I didn't pursue them in in case they had friends waiting in the neighborhood or something, likely to lure me in case I had cash. 

The good news: The Police have a lot of leads and have the name and phone number of the person who stole it. Plus, the idiot thief already posted the iPhone X online.",300,1694,2018-04-23,AAPL,0.12504972517490387,0.8478808999061584,0.027069393545389175

AppleWatch,"I just released my first app, Nano, the wrist-based Reddit client!","Meet **Nano**, the free wrist-based Reddit client you never knew you needed!

# But why?

Good question, and I ask ""Why not?"". Nano was created from a ""What if"" moment, specifically, ""I wonder if I can make a basic Reddit app for watchOS"", and it snowballed from there. It's also useful for sneaking some Reddit into class or meetings. It has some impressive features, such as:

## Subscriptions, Favorites, and Multireddit support

Nano loads up all of the subscriptions you've come to know and love, along with any favorites or multireddits you've setup. Additionally, with scribble and dictation support, you can visit any subreddit, anytime.

## Upvote, Downvote, and Saving

See something you like? You can upvote it from your wrist. See something you don't like? You can downvote it too!. Want to save something for later? Nano's got you covered, but what if you want it now...


## Handoff support

For those times when you're reading something, and you think, ""I'd love to read this on my big screen"", not to worry, Nano supports handoff to the official Reddit client, Apollo, and Narwhal, and more coming soon!

## Article Reader

The article reader allows you to read all the news posts straight from your wrist. With support for many popular websites and experimental support for everything else, you can always keep up to date without your phone*.

## And that's just the tip of the iceberg!

There is so much more to Nano, and I can't wait for you all to try it out!

iphone,iPhone for a Blind friend. Kudos to Apple and a question.,"Edit 2 on 04/29/2018:  Microsoft has an app called Seeing AI that works with iPhone. You point your phone at something and it reads it or tells you what it is. Absolute game changer. If you know anyone who is blind, make sure they know about Seeing AI. Kudos to Microsoft. 

Edit 04/28/2018:  You Guys are awesome!  So many good hearted people offering to help. And the iPhone and Siri for a blind person is phenomenal!  Apple absolutely got this right. To watch her cry and laugh as she discovers what she can do, just wow!  I visited her for a couple more hours today and we started implementing your suggestions. Pandora does auto play on the last station she had playing and she had already discovered that. We got her Apple Music set up and she loves it. We set up Be My Eyes (thanks a million) this one made her cry when we tested it (sorry to the guy it called for us to simply test it out). We also put Google Assistant on her phone and she started conversing with OK Google. The Voice Over feature already has her learning the number positioning for the key pad and it’s so amazing how she can tap an app once just to know what it is, and then double tap if she wants to open it. She’s already mastering these techniques in just a couple days. As Steve Jobs said “it just works” and its amazing how intuitive it can be even for someone who is blind. I’m still reading a lot of what you guys sent to me and I’m sure we’ll add more apps and more functions next week after inread more and learn more. Cheers!


Original post:  First the question. Does anyone know a music app that can auto-play when it opens?  So if I say “Hey Siri, Launch [Music App Name]” it will open and already play music without having to press any other button. My friend can’t afford $10 per month for Apple Music which I know could solve the problem and allow her to request artists, albums etc by Siri. 

A friend of mine is blind and I regularly take her to her doctor appointments. She still has a flip phone that she dials by pressing an old school real key pad with numbers. Yesterday when i went to pick her up for an appointment she told me her phone died on her, wouldn’t respond to charging or anything. I took her to the store and bought her an iPhone 8 Red and AirPods. We activated at the store and then went to her apartment to set everything up. I entered her contact names and phone numbers (99% of the numbers she knew by heart). I went into settings, general, accessibility and turned on Voice Over. We then proceeded to run through all the Siri commands learning what she can do. Tears and laughter followed for the next hour, the iPhone completely opened her world. What an amazing technology for the blind. She started texting her family and they couldn’t believe they were receiving texts from her. Her sister came over immediately asking what in the world was going on. 

She’s on a fixed income and we’re hoping to find her a Music app that will play when it opens without costing a monthly subscription. Her son got her an Alexa speaker for Christmas and she listens to Pandora on it but it would be nice if she could use her iPhone and headphones to listen to music without having to press a Play button that she can’t see. 

A few hours after I left she called me and said that the phone rang and she didn’t have her headphones or AirPods nearby and couldn’t answer the call. Then I suddenly realized I didn’t go over every possibility with her, and in all my reading I didn’t see anything about that. I realized she had consistently answered my calls by tapping on the AirPod or pressing the button on the wired headphones and when they weren’t within reach she missed a call. I called Apple and the first person I spoke with (and his supervisor) couldn’t answer the question of how a blind person can answer the phone without using headphones or AirPods. 

He transferred me to the Siri Accessibility unit. He very quickly told me to have her use 2 fingers to double tap the screen. Sure enough that worked. Problem solved. He also explained where I could go into Settings to set every call for auto-answer if she wanted. 

If all of these functions of the iPhone for the blind weren’t impressive enough, he told me to enter a contact in her phone with their 800 number named Siri Accessibility. Then any time she has a problem working the phone she can say Hey Siri Call Siri Accessibility and it would call their department - which Apple has available 24/7 and even holidays to help the blind, the disabled and those trying to use or help with the special Accessibility functions. 

Kudos to Apple. More than hardware, offering great services for the blind and disabled too. I know I’m already a fanboy and Siri takes much criticism but there is so much that Apple does right. And when you witness a blind person using Siri for the first time (after years of a flip phone) it gives an appreciation for how far the technology has come.

I took her to the store and bought her an iPhone 8 Red and AirPods. We activated at the store and then went to her apartment to set everything up. I entered her contact names and phone numbers (99% of the numbers she knew by heart). I went into settings, general, accessibility and turned on Voice Over. We then proceeded to run through all the Siri commands learning what she can do. Tears and laughter followed for the next hour, the iPhone completely opened her world. What an amazing technology for the blind. She started texting her family and they couldn’t believe they were receiving texts from her. Her sister came over immediately asking what in the world was going on. 

She’s on a fixed income and we’re hoping to find her a Music app that will play when it opens without costing a monthly subscription. Her son got her an Alexa speaker for Christmas and she listens to Pandora on it but it would be nice if she could use her iPhone and headphones to listen to music without having to press a Play button that she can’t see. 

A few hours after I left she called me and said that the phone rang and she didn’t have her headphones or AirPods nearby and couldn’t answer the call. Then I suddenly realized I didn’t go over every possibility with her, and in all my reading I didn’t see anything about that. I realized she had consistently answered my calls by tapping on the AirPod or pressing the button on the wired headphones and when they weren’t within reach she missed a call. I called Apple and the first person I spoke with (and his supervisor) couldn’t answer the question of how a blind person can answer the phone without using headphones or AirPods. 

He transferred me to the Siri Accessibility unit. He very quickly told me to have her use 2 fingers to double tap the screen. Sure enough that worked. Problem solved. He also explained where I could go into Settings to set every call for auto-answer if she wanted. 

If all of these functions of the iPhone for the blind weren’t impressive enough, he told me to enter a contact in her phone with their 800 number named Siri Accessibility. Then any time she has a problem working the phone she can say Hey Siri Call Siri Accessibility and it would call their department - which Apple has available 24/7 and even holidays to help the blind, the disabled and those trying to use or help with the special Accessibility functions. 

Kudos to Apple. More than hardware, offering great services for the blind and disabled too. I know I’m already a fanboy and Siri takes much criticism but there is so much that Apple does right. And when you witness a blind person using Siri for the first time (after years of a flip phone) it gives an appreciation for how far the technology has come.

apple,TIL: The battery percentage indicator on macOS is not an actual representation of the Charge Remaining (in mAh) around 100% which wasn't the case with old macOS,"I happened to notice today that my MBP(running macOS High Sierra) if kept on charge at 98% or 99%, it charges all the way upto 100%. But a few years back I remember that my old MBP(running OS X Lion), wouldn't recharge until the battery percentage indicator dropped below 95% and this was because to prolong the overall life of the battery. I verified this behaviour on OS X Lion again today.

Upon investigating further, I noticed that the newer macOS stays on 100% charge for a longer period of time even though it's actual Charge Remaining (in mAh) would have started reducing just like the behaviour on iOS.

The battery percentage indicator on newer macOS stays at 100% until 5% of the Full Charge Capacity (in mAh) has dropped. The moment when the Charge Remaining (in mAh) is below 95% of the Full Charge Capacity (in mAh), the battery percentage indicator drops to 99%. This wasn't the same behaviour in older OS X where the battery percentage indicator was an actual representation of the Charge Remaining (in mAh) which is why we would have seen in the past that it didn't recharge until it dropped below 95% but with newer versions of macOS, even though the underlying behaviour is the same (to not recharge until the true battery charge falls below 95%), the battery indicator speaks otherwise.

I am not aware in which version of macOS this behaviour was changed to match the behaviour with iOS.

TL;DR: The battery percentage indicator on newer macOS stays at 100% until 5% of the Full Charge Capacity (in mAh) has dropped.",83,887,2018-04-29,AAPL,0.10550863295793533,0.8507727980613708,0.04371858388185501
