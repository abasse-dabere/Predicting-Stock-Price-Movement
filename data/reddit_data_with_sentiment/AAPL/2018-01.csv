apple,FYI: Apple *deletes* your Apple Music library if you unsubscribe - if you resubscribe later everything will be gone,"I was a subscriber to Apple Music from the very beginning, during which time I built up a library of albums and artists I loved.

6 months ago I cancelled my subscription. Yesterday, I resubscribed only to find all my saved albums and artists gone. I contact Apple support, and got [this reply](https://imgur.com/a/YQrEP):

&gt; My apologies for the inconvenience but once Apple Music subscription gets cancelled, all your music and playlists from the Apple Music catalog also get removed. No option to have those recovered. You will need to manually rebuild your playlists and download songs.

So, in case you intend to suspend your subscription, be sure to note down all the artists, albums, playlists, ""Loved"" songs. 

Personally, the is the last straw with Apple Music. I'm switching to Spotify.

**Edit**: A few clarifications, since there seems to be some misunderstanding in this thread.

 - I understand that the music disappears when you unsubscribe. It's a subscription service, you should no longer have access to the music itself. It's the playlists I'm annoyed about, which I'd expect to come back when resubscribing. If it's called iCloud Music Library, then why is it emptied even when my iCloud account persists? If that's Apple's decision, that's fair, but it should have been more obvious that my library would be emptied so I'd have a chance to export it. That's why I'm warning others.

 - I did enable and sync my iCloud Music Library, but this doesn't fix the problem, because Apple has deleted the data in it. The [official support reply](https://imgur.com/a/YQrEP) is in response to me letting the customer service rep know that my iCloud Music Library was enabled and had synced up.

 - Some people are reporting that their playlists do come back when resubscribing. It seems like if you leave for only a few months, your songs are kept. But in my case, I was unsubscribed for 6 months - during which time my playlists were deleted.",886,5825,2018-01-02,AAPL,0.30615565180778503,0.6745319366455078,0.019312430173158646

apple,Apple charges you $30 for the exact same battery,"**Update:** Apple Store confirmed that my original battery was never replaced by the serial numbers, they replaced it today. 

&amp;nbsp;

I took my iPhone 6s to the Apple Store to check if it qualified for the battery replacement program. I was initially told that they ran out of 6s batteries but took an appointment for a battery diagnostic anyway. They found my battery was ‚Äúconsumed and defective‚Äù and offered to replace it that day (odd since they ‚Äúran out‚Äù of batteries).

&amp;nbsp;

They ‚Äúreplaced‚Äù my battery and returned it to me later, charging me $30 for the replacement. [RECEIPT](https://i.imgur.com/PaJozuQ.png)


I later checked my battery status through Coconut Battery and found it to be the SAME degraded battery as before, with the same number of charge cycles and degradation percentage. [Coco battery](https://i.imgur.com/zr8fZjd.png) 

I confirmed that this was the same battery through Apple Support. Screenshots of support chats [#1](https://i.imgur.com/SX2Alk3.png) [#2](https://i.imgur.com/k6m4YyR.png) 

&amp;nbsp;

Support chats also reveal that the SAME battery can be considered ‚Äúin good health‚Äù or ‚Äúconsumed and needing a replacement‚Äù.


&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR - Make sure to check that Apple actually replaced your battery. Charged for original battery ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù after waiting from 10:30 AM until 4:00 PM only to be left with the original battery.**

apple,What is your experience with store.apple.com 2 hour courier delivery?,"I am in downtown Seattle.

I was busy at the office yesterday.

Just got a new MacBook Pro and needed a few more of those USB C to USB adaptors.

Went to store.apple.com to order them.

Noticed Apple is offering 2 hour courier delivery for $9. Neat! It would take me an hour of travel time to get up to the University Village Apple Store and back not counting the time to buy the things in the store.

So I set-up the order and flopped down my fingerprint on the sexy new MacBook Pro to complete it. Instantly got the email saying I would receive the goods within 2 hours. 

I felt good and went back to work knowing I would soon have my cables needed for a project.

2 hours went by - nothing happened yet. I checked the order status and it said the items were ready and waiting for courier pick-up. I thought maybe the guarantee was 2 hours from the time the courier picks it up - OK not as cool but I was busy anyway and this is still better than driving to the Apple Store.

So finally 4 hours go by - no delivery. I check the order status on the web and in the Apple store app on my phone - Still just sitting there awaiting courier pickup....

I decide to call 800-MY-APPLE per the confirmation email.

Support rep I talked to said its supposed to be delivered within 2 hours of the order being placed. She put me on hold for a while and called the Apple store the order is coming from and also claimed she called the courier. She came back to me and said that the courier had an issue and would be picking it up very soon and then call me to tell me they are on their way. I felt confident this is what would happen so I went back to work now approaching the time I would leave the office hoping it would arrive so I could leave for the day (says online you have to meet the courier and sign for it more like an Uber Eats delivery - not like a UPS / FedEx delivery)

Finally 2 more hours went by - nothing.

Log in to check the web status - still just says its siting there awaiting courier pickup. So I call in again to 800-MY-APPLE. The first rep I get, after hearing the saga disconnects me. Bleh - so I call in again. The second rep puts me on hold for 15 minutes to do the call store / call courier routine. I wait and wait - when he comes back on the line he says ""I just talked to the apple store and....."" click* the call dropped. grrrr.....

So I call in AGAIN.

This time I get a lady who claims she is a supervisor. I tell her the whole story. She thinks its terrible. Im now at the office after hours waiting on this fabled courier that I keep being told will arrive with my cables. She calls the Apple store where my cables are waiting for courier pickup. After much fanfare she returns to the line to tell me that the best thing she can do is cancel the existing order. She says Apple support has no way to contact the courier who is supposed to be Postmates and she was told by the apple store manager that the procedure, when courier pickup never happens is to cancel the order and then re-create the order. (for courier delivery orders, we the customer cannot do this over the web or from the apple tore app - one needs to call in) 

So she cancels the order. She claims she actually trained the first girl I spoke to who told me that she talked to the courier and they would be on their way on my first call and would be sure to discipline her. She then re-creates the order and modifies the pricing so that im only paying $10 for each adaptor and $0.01 for the delivery. She claims that as soon as the Apple Store opens in the AM, the courier will pick up the order and bring it to me.

So wow what a bunch of grrrr but I go home for the night. 

Get into the office the next day at 8:00 AM feeling confident the courier will arrive within 2 hours of 9:30 AM with my cables.(the time the store opens)

9:45 rolls around still no cables and still no order status update. The new order is sitting there saying its ready and awaiting courier pickup......

grrr again. So I click right on the order where it says to initiate a web chat.  I ask the web chat rep what time the order will be picked up and when I can expect it. (I mean after all a guy needs to spit out to eat lunch at some point). She says she has no idea and that she cannot contact the store with my cables or the courier. I tell her that I NEED some kind of indicator as to when I need to be here and present to receive the cables. I then tell her that the procedure seems to be that she cancels the order and recreates it with my special pricing for the 7 hours  of wasted wait time the day before. She says that she cannot cancel and recreate and order and that I will need to call in - mega GRRRR

So I call in AGIAN to 800 MY APPLE.

The support rep I connect to tells me that he is unable to contact either the Apple Store or the courier associated with the order. The best he can do is tell me the status of the order which is ""awaiting courier pickup."" Im at the end of my rope here so I tell him ""too bad"" and he is going to have to do something or we are not getting off of the call.

He puts me on hold for 10 minutes. He returns and tells me he has ""a bunch of people running around and working on this to make it right for me and that he has even escalated it to his boss"" - ummm ok. 

I tell him I am sick of waiting and I am happy to just go pick it up at the store myself at this point if he can make sure when I get there I don't pay anything as I already paid online via Apple Pay. He claims that I would not be able to pick it up as its an order waiting for postmates pickup. He claims he can cancel the order and I am free to goto the apple store and pay the full price, not the discounted price I was given for my troubles the day before. I tell him thats not going to work and he will need to do better or we are not getting off of the call.

So he puts me on hold for another 5 minutes.

He returns to tell me - ""Oh! I see the problem, the support rep who made the order last night with the $0.01 shipping rate is what messed it up"" He continues that ""Postmates saw that $0.01 shipping charge and just decided not to go pick it up at the store as there was nothing in it for them"" hahaha insane.

I don't even bother to explain why that is idiotic and tell him to try again and we aren't disconnecting the call till he either gets a courier on the way to my office immediately with there cables or makes it where I can goto the store and pick up these cables for free now.

He then tries to reference my original order that was cancelled by Apple support the day before and claims that I do in fact have a free set of cables coming to be delivered by January 15th hahah. I tell him no - its a cancelled order that never left the store and I have had a refund issued. He tried his hardest to get me off the call with lies.

I stand firm with no no no and he needs to do something or I am not hanging up.

He tells me the only thing he can do is connect me to a senior support rep who will be able to sort this for me.

OKAY finally right? Someone who can make good on the fact that I have been waiting for almost 24 hours on a 2 hour courier delivery!

This lady was great for what its worth. She told me that most of the things I was told on previous calls were nonsense, that she has no way to contact the courier but can contact the store. She instantly guarantees that I will be refunded all monies paid to this point and I will get these cables for free one way or the other. 

So she claims she can create a new courier order, but since the point of failure seems to be Postmates she wouldn't want me to wait and wait more and never have them arrive. So she calls the Apple store and tells them to let me get the cables for free when I walk in. So I drove the 30 minutes to the store parked, walked in and was handed these cables really fast with no trouble. Insanity exited stage left and this felt like a reasonable experience finally.

ACI also sent me an email coupon that offers tiered discounts on a future order depending on how much I spend. The coupon expires end of Q1 2018.

I feel okay with Apple between the free cables and the coupon which really represents $75 in value to me - but wow what a painful 24 hours of dealing with their support and waiting on Postmates. I have never in my life had to call them so many times.

I feel Apple has redeemed themselves here to the best of their ability - and I finally have my USB C to USB cables - but I will NEVER EVER EVER try their 2 hour courier options again.",69,445,2018-01-06,AAPL,0.053706398233771324,0.9163695871829987,0.02992400713264942

apple,PSA: Don't send your iPhone in for a $29 battery replacement unless you're sure it will fail diagnostics,"***Update at the end of the post***

TLDR: Don't ship your phone to Apple for a $29 battery replacement unless you're absolutely sure it will fail diagnostics. Get a Genius Bar appointment instead. 

I shipped my iPhone 6 Plus in to Apple for a $29 battery replacement yesterday.  The. battery is marginal. The capacity can range from 77-83%. 

A few hours after they received my phone they updated the repair status to ""couldn't duplicate issue"" and included ""no trouble was found"" in the repair details. 

I immediately called Apple support, and they told me that all phones shipped to Apple must fail diagnostics to receive a new battery. I mentioned all the news articles saying that Apple will replace batteries regardless of the diagnostics, and they told me I should try going to an Apple Store. 

I asked for a supervisor and was told the same thing. They also checked with customer relations, and they said the same thing. They steadfastly refused to reconsider having the battery replaced before it was returned to me. 

Ultimately, they'd only offer to refund the repair fee and help me book an appointment at an Apple Store. 

The appointment is over a week away. I just hope they have batteries when I get there. 

-- Sent from my iPhone 5, which, oddly enough, is faster than my 6 Plus. 

Update:

I had a scheduled call back from Apple this afternoon to set up my Apple Store appointment. All appointments for the next 7 days near me were booked last night, and they're still booked for 7 days as of today. 

I asked if we could resolve the problem more easily by just doing a replacement. The rep put me on hold, talked to customer relations, and then agreed! If you end up in the same boat, it's worth asking if they can do the same!",84,249,2018-01-06,AAPL,0.10614681243896484,0.8540063500404358,0.039846815168857574
apple,Tribute to a forgotten MacBook Pro feature of old: the physical battery indicator,"Last summer, I sold my 2010 13"" and got a 2015 15"" rMBP, which I'm writing this post on. I love this machine. There's honestly not much I miss from my 2010, besides the physical button trackpad (yes, I prefer it to the Force Touch)... and the battery indicator.

On older MBPs, before the Retina series, there was a series of LEDs beside a little button on the left side. Press it, and the LEDs show you how full your battery is. Most of you might think nothing of it, but every time I'd pick it up to go somewhere, I'd tap that little button, which would tell me whether or not I should bring my charger, and save myself a trip back to my room. 

Now, you have to open the screen to check the battery, which wastes time, and most people would forget to do this (and then open the screen later to find out it's like 10% and they're not near the charger).

The humble battery indicator was one of those nice little Apple touches that I find myself subtly missing every day.",62,237,2018-01-06,AAPL,0.04531143605709076,0.9216921925544739,0.03299635648727417

He said they were making time for walk-ins but it might be a little wait. That was fine with me, so an hour later I show up at the store. Get in line to speak to a genius and when it‚Äôs my turn, he says ‚Äúsorry we haven‚Äôt had any batteries for days, but we can have a technician look at your phone and order one for you.

apple,PSA: how to clean your AirPods,"Hi there,

Somewhere in the past I came accross this and now I wanted to try it out. The metal grills in the Airpods (or Earpods) will get full of gunk and earwax. There is no easy way to clean this, and using liquids is not safe.

You can clean it with this type of sticky adhesive:
https://i.imgur.com/yeujjLO.jpg 
(I used Patafix by Bison).

You can mold it into little balls and press then firmly into the grill. The adhesive is sticky enough to remove all the gunk, but not too sticky to get stuck.

I tried it out first on old Earpods since I was affraid on using it. Here is the result:
https://i.imgur.com/GBnxzV4.jpg 
(Left pod uncleaned, right pod cleaned with patafix).

I used it on my Airpods too and they are clean again! I can also confirm it can remove lint from the AirPods‚Äô case hinge!

Hopefully some of you find this usefull

* Battery: 1168 (751 Cycles)

Geekbench score after:

* Single-Core: 1587

* Battery: Well... New haven't had time to redo this. 

My iPhone is noticeably snappier and feels not shit. Apps aren't dying so much and battery level seems to be much more stable (Doesn't jump around at random)

But that's not the interesting part. That was kinda all expected. And I'm happy with my new battery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: Hey man, just in to get the battery changed in my iPhone 6 under the new program.

Genius: That great! What issues are you having with your phone?

Me: Well battery life ain't great, and performance is dire, I can barely type at times.

Genius: This battery replacement will not improve performance. That's a software issue, **the only way you're going to get better performance is getting a new device.** Do you still want to get the repair?

Me: I mean it's also doing the shut down thing so I want it replaced regardless, not looking for a new phone at the moment.

Genius: Okay well it'll take 1-2 hours, it'll be ¬£25 when you get back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And I know it seems like a small thing, a small mention. But I think it's quite important and it annoyed me. Not only is it wrong, my iPhone has seen a noticeable speed increase due to the new battery as has it benchmarks. But the genius was fully prepared to show off new phones as a replacement.

Do I blame the genius? No I don't. But it shows a clear lack of understanding among staff about the issue... Which is possibly resulting in what Apple are denying they are doing. Throttling leading to up sell new iPhones.

apple,"Apple says battery supply constrained, expect replacement in April","Last week I went in to an Apple store have my iPhone 6+ battery replaced. I was actually just about to buy an iFixit kit right before Apple announced the lower replacement cost, so my timing seemed lucky and to Apple I went. 

I thought I would be somewhat beating the mainstream rush as I think I went on the 4th. Incorrect. Lots of people there doing the same and they were 20+ minutes late on my appointment. 

I was a little frustrated by the Genius helping me. He seemed to be pushing for me to not replace the battery and commented how old my phone was and why my plan was for keeping it. He tested my battery and said I was at 83% capacity. I explained I was surprised by that given the terrible performance lately, mostly the battery dropping 20+% in very short periods with no use. There is no doubt the battery is not performing anywhere near its original performance. He was receptive but went on to explain how a changed battery won‚Äôt increase performance and a new battery can‚Äôt reverse the ‚Äúwear and tear on all the other components‚Äù.  This felt like an odd explanation meant for someone else that doesn‚Äôt understand computer components. He should have just said current day software has higher hardware demands instead of incorrectly making it sound like my CPU‚Äôs ability to fetch from memory deteriorates each day with each call. I disagree with his assessment but politely said okay, but I would still like to pay to replace the battery purely on the merits of better battery performance, not compute performance. He agreed and put in an order since they were out of stock. At the time they expected stock by end of January. 

Anyway, I say all this to give the general feeling and vibe I have gotten from Apple  through this process. 

I just now received a message from Apple saying that the ‚Äúbattery supply is constrained‚Äù and ‚Äúexpect a call in April for the replacement‚Äù. Has anyone else received this call? April is a total surprise and I‚Äôm now leaning towards just doing it myself. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if either they are prioritizing people testing below 80% ahead of me. Or perhaps it‚Äôs just a super conservative estimate. I do not know. But this whole process has been the least Apple like experience I‚Äôve ever had with Apple.",158,289,2018-01-10,AAPL,0.08287688344717026,0.8600705862045288,0.05705253407359123

apple,PSA: Taking a lost iPhone to an Apple Store WILL NOT get it returned,"Hey y'all. Recently I've been seeing so many comments in ""lost my iDevice"" posts spreading misinformation. Taking a lost iPhone to Apple **will not get it back to the owner.** Although they likely have a way to associate a device to a particular customer, they will not give the customer's information to you. If you give it to a person at an Apple Store they will likely just recycle the device.

---
**Things you can do to actually help:**

1. Ask Siri ""Who's phone is this"" 
2. Ask Siri to ""call/text mom"" or another family member
3. Keep the phone charged. The owner might call from another phone.
4. Write a note that says something like: Email / call me at ‚Äúxyz‚Äù and take a picture of it using their phone. To do this, swipe left to access their camera. If they access their iCloud gallery by chance, they‚Äôll see your note.
5. Swipe right. Look at whatever information is on their screen and see if you can find any identifying information on the apps displayed. Usernames or what have you.
6. Swipe down to look at Notification Center. Look for identifying information here too.
7. If they have a case, take it off. See if the owner has left their contact info. (Thanks /u/robotsmakinglove)
8. Check the Medical ID Emergency Contact Information that may be on the Emergency Tab of the lockscreen (Thanks /u/64Spaces)
9. Set a reminder with Siri that includes your contact info, if they have a Mac or other device this may sync up (Thanks /u/Kazoopi)

apple,"Just because it doesn't say it supports Apple Pay, does not mean it doesn't support Apple Pay.","I decided to do an experiment today and try to use Apple Pay everywhere, regardless of whether or not there was an Apple Pay/Android Pay logo, or whether there was an obvious contactless payment section of the terminal.

I went to the grocery store near me (Shop-Rite, Philadelphia suburbs) and I have never used Apple Pay, because it had never indicated it supported it and the card readers did not look like they had NFC.  For yucks, I held up my phone and was immediately prompted for my fingerprint and the payment went through.

Then I went to get gas, and held up my phone to the credit card slot on the pump and once again I get prompted for my finderprint and the payment goes through, even though there is no indicator on the pump that it does contactless payments.

The one store that *$^#@!! drives me nuts is CVS.  Those terminals clearly support cotactless payments, with the giant piece of plastic sticking out of the top with the wireless logo, and CVS disables it on purpose.  This is one of the reasons I tend to go to Walgreens now.

We have a chain of convenience stores here called Wawa, and they never accepted chip.  Up until recently, they only accepted swiping a card.  When I asked an employee why they don't do chip, he said, chip takes too long.  They need to get customers in and out as fast as possible.  They do a huge volume in the morning of people just buying coffee.  And chip would more that double the wait times of their customers, which would lead to checkout lines snaking throughout the store.  Well, they still don't accept chip, but now they do ApplePay.

The three big plusses for me with ApplePay is:

1. For things I will never return (20 oz soda at Wawa, etc), I don't need the receipt. i can just look on my phone and see how much I spent.

2. When I get gas, when I check my online banking, I see the gas station's charge for $1.00 as a pending transaction for when they verify the card.  The actual charge for the full amount of gas I bought will show up 24-48 hours later.  With ApplePay, it's right there on my phone.

3. Restaurant charges will often show the amount of the meal minus the tip as a pending transactions, and then 1-2 days later, the pending transaction drops off and the full charge with meal+tip shows up.  With Apple Pay, the full charge is on my phone.  Another receipt I don't need to keep.",312,657,2018-01-12,AAPL,0.03828946873545647,0.9281115531921387,0.03359901160001755

apple,This subreddit needs to clean up its act.,"Before you look at this post and just downvote it, please take a moment to listen. This is not a rant. I just think that this sub has so much room for improvement.

Over a gradual time of posting here, I've noticed a terrible negative energy from quite a lot of users, enough to make an overall impression. It seems that asking even the most undemanding question leads to downvotes and condescending answers. Obviously it's very petty to get hung up about something as insignificant as a downvote, but let's be real, would you feel welcomed if you thought you were asking a reasonable question and then just got patronized like that?

It's not just me either. I see it all the time with other people. They ask super understandable questions such as ""Does Snow Leopard still work?"" and then they wait an hour for the post to have 25% upvotes and an inbox containing an invitation to Ellipses city. I don't mean to put myself in the spotlight, but I would answer a question like that just fine, and make sure that the person asking the question feels like they've made a friend in a nice little community. Why can't some of you do the same? Since when does your arrogant attitude please anyone?

I wouldn't be making this post if it was just a few rotten apples because those exist in every community, but this is a problem here. It's overwhelmingly unfriendly and quite frankly, it sort of enhances the ""apple fanboy"" stereotype in retrospect.

I love this sub! I want it to succeed and I love talking to other people about Apple products, learning things, teaching others what I know and what I've already learned, etc., especially in a website like Reddit where Apple users and products are immensely looked down upon. This should be the safe space for Apple users to talk to each other and have fun, and part of doing that is asking questions. If you want to support the saying, ""Don't be afraid to ask questions,"" then act on it and answer respectively. Acting like you know everything is not only leaving the person asking the question with a bad taste in their mouth, but it's hindering you as well. You don't know everything. You still have a lot to learn just like everybody else and quite frankly, the person asking the question is already communicating better than you are because they are bravely taking the step to ask a dumb question and the risk of getting laughed at while you are living in cynicism and refusing to open your mind to other possibilities and ideas.

So to those that are contributing to this problem, I ask you this: would it hurt to answer a question, no matter how stupid it is, with kindness?

apple,My iPhone 6s experienced a whopping 75% performance boost after replacing the battery,"My iPhone 6s was suffering from ridiculously sluggish performance. I thought iOS 11 was too much for the hardware to handle, so I considered upgrading to an iPhone X. Then I read about the whole throttling controversy and decided to try a battery replacement.

I ran a benchmark on my iPhone 6s (which had a 9 month old battery) using Geekbench before and after the replacement. 

Before the replacement, single core performance was 1451. 

After the battery replacement, single core performance went up to 2536.

**That's a whopping 75% increase in performance.** My phone feels several generations newer!

I wonder how many people could've just replaced their battery instead of going out and buying a new device.

apple,"My girlfriend and I went to have our phone batteries replaced at an Apple store, two very different experiences","Hi /r/apple,

My girlfriend and I went yesterday to get our iPhone batteries replaced, and we experienced almost polar opposite customer service experiences. While we both had to wait about an hour past our appointment time to be helped due to it being busy, everything else was vastly different. 

For me, I checked it, waited 40-ish minutes, and then was called back to the genius table, where I then waited another 20 minutes. I was then greeted by the genius who took my phone, input the data apple needed onto his iPad, and told me that I could come back tomorrow to get the phone, since it was the evening and due to their load, it would not be done until the morning.  All while having pleasant  small talk with the genius.  Very much what I would expect of the apple in-store experience, quick (once I actually got to see a genius) and professional.

My girlfriend, on the other hand, had a very negative experience.  Firstly, lets call her ""Jane Doe"", but her name is actually noticeably foreign and somewhat hard to pronounce.  When she arrived, she went to the check in rep and told him her name was ""Jane"".  He then said he had no record of her appointment in the system. She then tells him her last name ""Doe"", same result.  She asks if he could try by first name and spells out her name ""J-A-N-E""  (her real name is only 6 letters), and he says he still can't find her.  She's standing beside him and glances over at him, and sees her name on the list and tries to point it out to him, but he says she'll need to go see a supervisor to get it sorted out.  Now the thing to note about her iPhone 6 is that the battery is so degraded it cannot do simple tasks, like open the camera, apps, and sometimes even the web browser, because the power spike goes over the batteries available voltage.  So she tries to load her email on her phone to show the genius confirmation, but because her battery is so bad, she cannot open the browser for the supervisor, so she has to come and get my phone to open her email.  She shows them her confirmation email, and suddenly (!!!) shes back in the system and checked in for her appointment. 

She then waits about the same amount of time as me (40ish minutes to see genius, another 20 to see genius once at table), although she was at a different table then myself.  What happens next is almost one of the most un-apple like service experiences I've ever seen.  She sits down and the tech runs some diagnostics on her phone, then says ""your battery is in perfect operating condition, there's no reason for you to be here.  You're battery should actually be good until January of next year"".  My girlfriend starts explaining how her apps won't open at all in some cases and the genius responds that its caused ""by a botched iOS update, and she'll need to hard reset her phone and it should solve the issue"". Now my girlfriend is not tech savvy at all, so she asks the Genius if he can walk her through the reset process. He replies ""Oh its easy, you don't need me for that, you can do it at home"".  She indicates she doesn't feel comfortable doing it herself and he replies ""its super easy, anyone can do it.  just google it when you get home"", then he told her they were done and she could leave.

I thought apple was supposed to be one of the best customer support experiences around. I don't think someone who waited an hour to see a genius should be shoo'd away after a few minutes and told to fix the issue themselves.  Furthermore, I thought that the $29.99 battery replacement was for all out of warranty phones, so simply by her requesting it it would be performed?  I didn't think there was a pre-requesite that the battery had to be below a certain threshold. There were two customers before me at my table who both were having iphone 6 battery replacements where I overheard the full exchanges, and it no point did the genius at my table go over their battery results with them, she just heard they wanted them replaced and and took their phones and put the work order in. 

My question is what should our next steps be? Should we just get her a second appointment and not mention the first one at all? Maybe have me stay at her side the whole time and they'll treat her more seriously, as sexist as that sounds? Is filing a complaint something we should be considering, and if so, with who? Because in my opinion, the level of service she received was quite simply unacceptable. 

If anyone else has had negative genius experiences, I would love to hear your stories and what steps you took to get the issue resolved.",143,337,2018-01-19,AAPL,0.05686742439866066,0.9122698903083801,0.03086264617741108

apple,Apple really needs to refresh the entry level iMac and Mac Mini.,"Sorry if this isn't the right place for this but I feel Apple really needs a refresh for the low end iMac and Mac Mini.

I am the Mac administrator at work, most of the time users order MBPs or upgrade iMacs with a SSD or at the very least a fusion drive. 

We just had a few iMacs and Mac Minis ordered for a lab, they just wanted to go with the cheapest Mac they could for whatever they are doing. I took them out of the box, turned them on and prepared to go through the Apple setup. The amount of time it took from turning it on to get to the language selection screen was crazy. Going through the whole setup was so slow. I thought maybe I got a lemon but when I started setting the others up I realized that's just the way they are.

Our Macs are managed but the slowness was very real even before the DEP portion of the setup. When I setup a MBP, it seems lightning fast when setting it up and even after DEP enrollment has occurred and config profiles and policies have been applied.

I'm not sure exactly what it is that causes this, maybe it's the mechanical hard drive, maybe it's the processor although an i5 should be a bit more snappy than this. Sorry if this post is uninteresting, I just needed to vent somewhere about the quality of the lower ends Macs.

apple,Watch out for this sophisticated scam...,"The other day I had my iPhone X stolen. It was a little sad but at the end of the day it's just a phone, right? I wasn't really worried about my data or anything because everything that I wanted is backed up to iCloud every day and they wouldn't be able to unlock the phone without my face or code, so I really wasn't too worried.

Even though iOS' security and iCloud's features bring me a lot of peace, I still put it in Lost Mode. I did that maybe 10 minutes after it was gone, but it still says it was pending. So the thieves must have been ""smart"" enough to turn it off, right? I understand that they can turn it off and restore it but it will be blocked with Apple's Activation Lock.

It was from an American number with a 925 area code and it mentioned my phone's exact name. I am assuming they got the number from the phone (using Siri?) and the device name from iTunes.

 They conveniently provided a link to view the location of the device and signed their text message as Apple Support. Looking at the link, I could tell that it was a fake right away (it wasn't apple.com or even a .com domain) but it made me think that they were actually pretty clever! They would get you to go to their phishing website to give them your AppleID and login in order to disable the activation lock! Pretty clever for a thief... Anyway, today I actually received a call from someone claiming to be Apple Support and I didn't really even listen but instead just hung up.

Just wanted to share this in case it happens to you!

tl;dr I lost my iPhone X and they retrieved the device name and my phone number from the phone and tried to phish my Apple ID to disable the activation lock.",131,952,2018-01-20,AAPL,0.05851662531495094,0.9162691235542297,0.02521427534520626

My loyal Apple Watch Series 0 (stainless) popped off its display last week after almost three years of every day usage (btw: feeling your phone vibrate again is a really strange experience).

Anyway I booked an appointment at my nearest Apple Store (Amsterdam) for my watch but I also brought some other Apple products that were behaving a bit iffy.

At the end of my hour at the genius bar, Apple not only replaced my Watch free of charge (battery was bloated). They also replaced my old iPhone 6 (that I use as a work phone) for the lowly price of 30 bucks. On top of that they even replaced my Airpods for free due to a strange connection issue.

So for the price of just 30 euros, I walked out of the Apple Store with a brand new Watch, a new iPhone 6 &amp; new Airpods. And I don't even have Apple Care on any of those products.

apple,"My never ending tale of 4 replacement 15"" Touch Bar MBP's and I need some advice!","I‚Äôll keep this as quick as I can, as it‚Äôs been an awful ride! But a nice box collection right?? https://i.imgur.com/v8o5HOJ.jpg

Save up my coin for a top spec 2016 MBP-TB as I want to get into audio engineering and mixing. I have started a Masters in music and wanted to take the year seriously, I also wanted a machine that I could keep for the next 7-8 years and watch it kick ass throughout. 

MACBOOK 1 JOINS THE GAME.

Works good, right up until it starts making a horrible chassis rattle. Like something was loose and running around in there, take it to the store and I get an IMMEDIATE replacement. Nice! Although backing up and getting everything back on the machine is a pain (Logic doesnt back up all the sound libraries, they have to be re-downloaded. On Australian internet it‚Äôs painful) 

MACBOOK 1 IS DEFEATED‚Ä¶

MACBOOK 2 JOINS THE GAME.

It starts rattling too! So I take it in, they offer a repair to make sure the issue doesn‚Äôt come back. I hate not having a laptop but if thats what it takes to have the 8 year old laptop dream so be it. 

Repair takes longer than quoted but I get it back. Get it home and the left thunderbolt ports are MIA. Nothing, nadda. So a freshly repaired macbook is worse than it left, sure it rattled but all the ports worked!!

I got back in, they swap me a referb with a slightly higher pocessor (I was only 1 off the top so that‚Äôs a nice boost!)

MACBOOK 2 IS DEFEATED‚Ä¶

MACBOOK 3 JOINS THE GAME. 

‚ÄúCool!‚Äù, I said. New macbook with spec bump in hand. ‚ÄúNow it will last 9 years!‚Äù I said with a smile, right up until it started rattling again. 

I ain‚Äôt rough with these machines! They are bagged and lovingly stored/transported. But I do gently tap on the chassis when setting tempos or when I am brain storming during a writing session. That‚Äôs how I keep finding the sound, also it would rattle setting down on tables‚Ä¶

I kick up a huge stink with Apple over the phone as they are getting flaky at this stage. They ended up sending me a 1TB drive as a ‚Äúsorry‚Äù, token and appreciated but a band aid fix if anything. 

I take it to the store. Tone has changed now, they declare that ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it is. No more repairs‚Äù. It cost me $5000 dollarydoos and not even my $500 Acer machines rattled. So I took my money back, and put it down on a 2017 of the same specs. 

MACBOOK 3 IS DEFEATED‚Ä¶

MACBOOK 4 JOINS THE GAME. 6 months have passed at this point. 

‚ÄúOh baby, this is finally it‚Äù I said excitedly. ‚ÄúNow I will last 10 years!‚Äù. *clears throat*

Disk Utility refused to partition the SSD. No bootcamp which means no FLStudio! On and off the phone with Apple and they don‚Äôt have a damn clue. They said they would email me back but in the end never did...

Months later the machine starts running real slow at times. Like single frame rate kinda stuff, 1998 Acer Aspire style. So I give it a whole reformat (I have reformatted my machines around 8 times at this point during this saga, somehow data kept running away and I‚Äôve lost some important files over time). Bootcamp works now which is nice but now a month later (today) it‚Äôs running slow again. Something is wrong, not even Safari opens at times. Not even the Finder! 3.1 GHz i7. 

But what‚Äôs almost worse is now the bloody hinge clicks! Every time you open it, it goes ‚ÄúPOP‚Äù. If I wanna adjust it? ‚ÄúPOP‚Äù. I move my leg while it‚Äôs on my lap, ‚ÄúPOP‚Äù. I took it to Apple, it needs a full lid change to fix it. Yes it‚Äôs cool that I don‚Äôt gotta pay, BUT WHY AM I HAVING THESE ISSUES!? I couldn‚Äôt have the work done anyways as I need my machine for my own work! I was expecting a screw tightening or something but it was full on surgery with a wait time. 

$5000, and now I have to take it back again. Not just for the hinge but for the awful performance I am getting on even a freshly formatted machine. 4 Macbooks. 

- - - - - - - - - - - -  This is where I need your help - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

What would you guys do?? I fuggin hate these things now, look at all the boxes I have! *the last one didn‚Äôt come in a box*

I‚Äôve had failed machines that are brand new, I‚Äôve even had failed repairs!! I‚Äôve been ignored and I‚Äôve had standards changed under my feet. Something was was seen as a ‚Äúquick get this guy another machine!‚Äù on my first visit to being pushed aside and told ‚Äúthat how it is, just deal with it‚Äù on the last.

I am close to getting my money back once more and never buying a Macbook again. Get a great Windows machine AND make a gaming PC for the same price as this beautiful piece of trash. (yes, many of you are having a great time with your 15‚Äù MBP with touch bar, alas I have not).

iphone,"Lawrence Finch on ""Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Battery Drain and other considerations""","*I found this post from Lawrence in the [Apple Support Communities](https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-12271) and thought it worthy of re-posting here.*

There is a myth that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on iOS devices (and other manufacturer's smartphones) drain your battery. As a result, a lot of people turn off Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth to ""save battery life."" This is the result of some self-appointed guru in the trade press years ago saying that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are energy hogs. It isn't true, and there is no reason to turn either off, and several good reasons to leave them on all the time. 

**Some real facts** (for iOS, although similar for other manufacturer's devices):

* Wi-Fi is off when an iPhone is asleep, unless plugged in. So turning it off is redundant.

* If WiFi is not actively being used it uses no power. Yes, it scans for networks every 15 seconds when the phone is not asleep, but that's just a receiver, and uses no measurable power (less than 1 mw).

* When WiFi is connected it uses 30 mw continuously, whether transferring data or not. But mobile data uses from 50 to to 500 mw depending on signal strength when using data or voice, so Wi-Fi is always the better choice if you are actively using the phone.

* Bluetooth uses no energy unless it is connected to a device. So there's no point in turning it off. And you are clearly using it when it is connected, so you don't want to turn it off then, either. While it listens for Bluetooth devices, it uses no measurable energy to do so, as with Wi-Fi.

* When Bluetooth has an active paired connection to a hands-free device it consumes 2.5 mw. As the battery capacity of an iPhone 8 (not plus) is about 6900 mwh, if Bluetooth was the only thing using power the battery would run down in about 2800 hours, or about 3 months. Some Bluetooth devices require higher power; the most will be 10 mw, but that still means that if your battery life isn't what you think it should be, the problem is not Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
 
**What are other reasons that some users turn off Wi-Fi?**

* To protect against hackers: There are no known hacks that use Wi-Fi with iOS devices running current versions of iOS, so this is not a valid reason to turn off Wi-Fi.

* To avoid being tracked: There are services that track your location by detecting your Wi-Fi address (MAC address). 3 years ago Apple recognized this as a privacy issue, and they implemented a way to block MAC address tracking. Unless the network is one that the phone is actively connected to, iOS sends a random MAC address when a network ""pings"" the iOS device. So you can't be tracked through Wi-Fi. You can override this feature by connecting to, say, a mall's or store's ""free"" Wi-Fi service. So think twice about using ""free"" Wi-Fi; it isn't really free; you are paying with your privacy.

* So you don't get pop-ups asking if you want to join a network: The correct solution is to go to Settings/Wi-Fi and turn off ""ask to join networks.""
 
**Why should you leave Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on all the time?**

* First and foremost, there is no reason to turn them off.

* Wi-Fi provides assisted GPS (aGPS) for location services. Apple maintains a database of Wi-Fi networks worldwide. So even if you can't receive GPS satellite signals at all your iOS device can know your location. And when you first acquire GPS satellite signals after changing your location Wi-Fi positioning can speed up the process.

* If the phone is screen-locked, connected to power and connected to Wi-Fi if you turn on iCloud Backups the iOS device will back up daily, so the most data you can ever lose if your phone is lost, stolen, breaks or crashes is one day's worth. Which is why it's a good idea to plug your device in overnight, every night.

apple,"In honor of the iPad‚Äôs 8th anniversary, one of its original software engineers shares 8 unique memories of the experience.","https://mobile.twitter.com/bella_bongiorno/status/957378194927054848

‚Äúi joined the iphone team in the fall of 2008, as an iphone software EPM, but was soon asked to lead the software project management efforts for a new device. which i later learned was a tablet... 8 years ago today i sat behind al gore in the yerba buena center as steve showed the ipad off to the world. in honor of those 8 years, i thought i would share 8 memories from my time working on the ""magical device"".

(1) steve carefully chose the le corbusier chair that was used for the event. there was a sea of LC2 armchairs and each was carried out so he could inspect it in the stage lighting. did it have the right coloring? was there wear in the right places? did it have the right sit?

(2) when the third party developers were brought in a few weeks before the event, they were told they were only flying in for the day for a meeting. when they found out they would be stuck there for weeks, we had to take them to target to get more clothes and other necessities. 

(3) the third party devs were escorted and monitored at all times. we all signed up for shifts, even on the weekends. they weren‚Äôt able to bring their phones into their workroom, or use wifi, and the ipads were hidden in stealth cases so they couldn‚Äôt see the ID before the event.

(4) at one point steve wanted to turn UIKit elements orange. not just any orange, he wanted a particular orange from the button on a certain old sony remote. we got a bunch of remotes from sony with orange buttons to try and find the right one. in the end, steve hated it.

(5) right before the holiday break in 2009, less than a month before the announcement, steve decided he wanted the ipad to have homescreen wallpaper. an engineer worked through the holidays so steve could see it when we got back. the feature came to the phone in iOS 4.

(6) angry birds was released in dec 2009. a few of us on the team had become addicted and i knew it was going to be pretty big. we wanted it to be shown on stage at the event to demonstrate compatibility mode, but not everyone agreed with us.

(7) steve felt the UI behind scroll views (safari, mail etc.) looked unfinished. he wanted the attention to detail to be carried all the way through, even to parts you wouldn‚Äôt always see (‚Äúback of the cabinet‚Äù argument). so the macOS dashboard linen texture was brought to ipad.

(8) when steve held up the ipad, a journalist behind me screamed ‚ÄúOH MY GOD! IT‚ÄôS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I'VE EVER SEEN!‚Äù i got a taste for what ""insanely great"" felt like. little did i know it would be the first of many moments like this, but it would always be my favorite.",147,1330,2018-01-29,AAPL,0.03874480724334717,0.9247095584869385,0.036545660346746445

I can't quite figure out the exact conditions that lead to the information being censored or not.  It's definitely localised to different cities, and appears to be done based on GPS location, as opposed to IP based location information.  Turning off location services, restarting, and then accessing the apps with a VPN turned on makes the AQI data reappear. 

If this is intentional, as opposed to some sort of technical problem (unlikely, but I can't rule it out), I'm certain Apple is simply conforming with local regulations.  Much like the recent moves to [remove VPN apps from the Chinese Appstore](https://qz.com/1044199/tim-cook-defends-apples-removal-of-vpn-apps-from-its-chinese-app-store/), and [provide access to iCloud data for all users in China](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/11/apple-china-icloud-international-users/) (including international accounts unless they opt out).  It's clear Apple considers China an important market, and this is what they need to do to continue to operate in China.

However, I think it's worth considering the ethics of this move, and how it reflects on Apple as a company.  Accessing this information is not about undermining the Communist Party.  This is information that helps approximately 131 million iPhone users in China make decisions about their personal health and wellbeing.  I'm disappointed that a company that currently sets the industry standards for privacy and data management in other countries, can compromise so much on those ideals in pursuit of profits in China.

**Update:**  Same issue again this morning, except that both cities were failing to show AQI data.  Many users have posted reasonable skepticism that this is a technical issue, or if it is censorship, Apple is not necessarily complicit.  Given the intermittent nature of the issue, this explanation is sounding more plausible.  

It seems AQI data only appears in the default Weather app when you are in certain regions.  To get around internet censorship that blocks important services (Google, Dropbox, Slack etc.), I regularly connect to a number of different VPN servers, with locations in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and the US.  It's possible this is causing or contributing to the problem.  

Since I've only tested on the phones of colleagues (who connect to the same servers), and at least a couple other users in the comments are not having any problems, it seems that this is an isolated issue.  There's still some weirdness going on, but given the available evidence, I don't think it's the result of a technical decision by Apple.",143,522,2018-01-30,AAPL,0.08195608109235764,0.8948835730552673,0.02316032350063324
