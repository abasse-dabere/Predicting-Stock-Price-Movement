iphone,iPhone 4s videos were corrupted during cut/paste to PC.,"I had some really important videos filmed on my iPhone 4s.  I cut &amp; pasted them to my Windows 7 PC.  I now realize that was very stupid and risky, as half of the MOV files cannot be opened anymore either with VLC, Quicktime or WMP, and they are not anymore on my iPhone.  Quicktimes says: ""Error -2048: Couldn't open the file because it is not a file that Quicktime understands.""  They have no thumbnail and it says they are 1Kb or 256Kb large (which is ridiculously small for 1080p video files).  The rest of the files work perfectly and are 10,000Kb to 50,000Kb large.  All the videos worked perfectly on my iPhone.

I have tried to repair it with a program called File Repair, but it was no use.  I believe the corrupted files are definitely lost because the file size indicates that information has been lost in the transfer...  

I really need these files.  Is there anyway I can repair the corrupted files or recover the deleted files from my iPhone?

mac,A couple of questions,"1) I have my Mac set up so the dock auto hides and then re-appears when I hover over it and I want to know if there's a way to create a shortcut where I show and hide it at will, and then have it permanently hidden until I use this shortcut.

2) Because of the above set up, when I use Bowtie, it's only ever on the top when I'm on it. So I was wondering if there's a way to have it always on the top, even when I'm using other applications.

mac,Misbehaving 13'' MacBook Pro (Late-2011).,"Hello /r/mac.

Some of you might have seen me around here, responding to several threads.

I've been running into some issues with my MBP (late-2011).
For a week, the screen occasionally freezes and fills up with blue rectangles. ([image](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s261/sh/61d2d9e6-36af-4edc-af36-29c26fac24d9/f05db4c917409c77dce9aa70b50e9a5c/res/f5aa1522-5d03-4106-a136-268f43d0b6ea/IMG_20130402_171629.jpg))
The screen either turns black or stays frozen; 3 beeps in a row, then a little pauze and the 3 beeps start again. This repeats.

For my efforts to resolve this, I saw a genius at the Amsterdam Apple Store. He told me:'3 beeps is a memory issue, let me reseat them and see if that works'. He probably did more than he should have, since it's not his memory. Yet I am not convinced it is a memory issue, think of me to be ignorant or stubborn, it seems illogical that this would only appear when I am doing some gaming (Minecraft), or when watching a youtube video that is quite long.

I have tested watching some video's through Plex and that works just fine. I have also been running the Apple Hardware Tests, the short-test turned out to be fine, yet the extended-test froze and I cut it off (it was past the memory test. this is what I saw and I am not familiar with the order of testing in AHT).

**TL;DR (or to sum it up):**

* Issue with Mac freezing up, screen distortion or going black ([image](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s261/sh/61d2d9e6-36af-4edc-af36-29c26fac24d9/f05db4c917409c77dce9aa70b50e9a5c/res/f5aa1522-5d03-4106-a136-268f43d0b6ea/IMG_20130402_171629.jpg))

* 3 beeps play when this happen, followed by a small pauze and then 3 beeps. (repeating)

* ran the  Apple Hardware Test; short-test turned out fine, extended-test froze and I rebooted my Mac.

I hope any of you know the solution to this, or maybe have some advice.

Thank you in advance,

Althestrasz.

apple,Tethered iPod Touch as replacement for stolen iPhone?,"Had my iPhone swiped out of my pocket on a crowded bus a couple of days ago on holiday. I'm currently trying to work out what the best plan for replacement is. 

The phone was a 64gb 4S, and as Apple don't make them any more I don't seem to be able to get one new for much less than an iPhone 5. But given that there seem to be a fair amount of rumours about the next iPhone being just around the corner (although when aren't there?) I don't particularly want to splash out on a 5 right now either. 

What I do still have is a work Android phone (Galaxy SII), which I'm allowed to use for reasonable personal use - so this can at least cover my basic phone needs.

However, I much prefer iOS to Android and have a fair few apps that I use on a regular basis so I was thinking - maybe I could get an iPod Touch and tether it to the SII (the Touch could go to my daughter when the next iPhone comes out). So my question is - what, if anything, am I going to be missing out on compared to a new iPhone taking this route?

We were often getting our chargers confused with our friend's, so wanted a cool way to easily identify our own.

iphone,[Discussion] What's in Apple's future?,"I found a post about how the Apple's biggest achievement was the first point-and-click computer, followed by the iPhone and then the original iPod, with nothing groundbreaking after that. iPhones, in particular, account for a huge chunk of [Apple's income](http://www.valuefolio.com/storage/2011%20Apple%20Net%20Sales%20by%20Product.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1325560500819), but there is a problem.

My opinion is that iOS 7 unless they change their stance on jailbreaks or innovate. Innovation often comes from jailbreakers, who are being increasingly excluded from creating tweaks and bringing ideas to iPhones. iOS 6 added a fewer practical features, less than iOS 5, and even less than iOS 4. I think this trend will continue unless something changes.

I may be wrong, but this is my opinion. Thoughts?",29.0,9,2013-04-11,AAPL,0.0743880420923233,0.8830573558807373,0.0425545759499073

iphone,Why does the iPhone rely on 3G/LTE for iMessage even when on wifi?,"Title says it all. I'm using the iPhone 5 btw. And before people say I'm crazy...

Last night I noticed this twice. Once in a low signal building with wifi. I'm on wifi but iMessage wouldn't send anything. Once I disconnected I noticed I was roaming. I turn of data and then turn wifi back on and then it sent messages again. I turn data back on and I'm still roaming and even though I'm on wifi nothing would send. My friends with iPhones that aren't 5s were able to send basically everything in there while me and another 5 user were too busy complaining about signal. The other 5 user had AT&amp;T while I have sprint. 


The other situation happened at home. For some strange reason my Internet just cut out without actually doing so. I could connect to wifi on every device in the house and it would say we were connected but we couldn't go to websites or anything. So my phone says I'm on wifi and I'm using iMessage with my sister and its working. But my sister had to turn off wifi to receive while I got to leave mine on. 

Both situations show that in not using wifi at all with iMessage. Wifi works for my phone but when it comes to iMessage it's like it's sleeping. I'm seriously just about to restore this piece of crap. Anyone else noticing anything like this? Why does this happen?",12.0,8,2013-04-11,AAPL,0.07856270670890808,0.8977188467979431,0.0237184576690197

iphone,My new minimalist podcatcher app for is out!,"Thanks to some awesome Reddit beta testers, the iOS podcatcher app that I've been working on for several months is now ready and in the App Store.

A word of warning: I designed this app specifically for ***me***. There's a good chance very few people on the planet want the same kind of podcatcher app that I do but you may be one of them! It's extremely minimal, has very few screens, uses a lot of gestures rather than buttons, and is pretty opinionated (in terms of what it's doing behind the scenes). The interface has a bit of a learning curve, but almost all the user testing I've done has shown that once you learn it, using it is a good/fun/efficient experience.

I really stripped away everything that, in other apps, got in the way of just picking things to listen to on my way out the door. I subscribe to 60 or 70 podcasts at any given time, and found other apps just didn't accomodate the kind of listening that I did.

This has been the only podcatcher I've used for months now, so while it's a v1 and definitely not perfect, it should hold up pretty well. 

If you're interested, take a read through of the app store description for some tips on navigating the UI (or feel free to ask!). The intro video doesn't do a stellar job of explaining how swiping from the edge of the screen works, because I was kind of rushing to get it done. I'm going to try to put together a simple website in the next few days with a better video. Also don't forget to check out the additional options in the phone's Settings app to help you customize various bits of the app.

Some things that didn't make it into version 1.0 that I hope to get to soon:

- Background downloading (with geofencing, or something like that)
- iCloud sync 
- Some parts of the UI didn't get the visual treatment I would have liked
- Podcast search that doesn't rely on a third-party provider
- A few small bugs that are left to squash

Version 1.1 is already in testing, and includes:

- Better handling of HTML in episode descriptions
- Shows all active downloads on the Downloads view
- More consistent styling in the Queue view
- Allows refreshing of individual podcasts
- Better UI feedback when bulk updating podcasts

Again, this app certainly isn't for everyone, but I like it, and if you think you may also, have at it.

iphone,Feature request: AirDrop integration from iOs devices.,"I think this would be a really simple way to get things (namely pictures) from your phone to your computer. 


Let's use pictures as an example:

On your Mac, you'd navigate to your AirDrop folder like you would if you were going to AirDrop between Macs. 

Then on your iOs device, you'd select the picture(s) you wanted to share then press the Action button. Amongst Mail, Message, Twitter, etc., you'd see an AirDrop icon. This could take you to another screen that'd show all the Macs on your current Wifi network that are AirDrop enabled. 

I know there are a lot of apps that do all kinds of file sharing (I currently use Dropbox to get pictures en masse from my phone to my computer), but this would be great since it'd integrated into the OS.

I know that there isn't currently a Google Music iOS app, but the service can be accessed through Safari, and it's accessible from any computer.

My question is, besides the convenience of an iOS app, why pay $25 a year for something you could get for free?

ios,what to ask an iOS developer on the interview?,"Hi all

Small intro,

I am project lead on a web app. The project is nearing to the and and CEO decided that he wants an phone app as well (never mind the fact that we pushed this since beginning, but I digress) in particular an iOS app. We have very short time before release (couple of months) 

I am pushing the solution where we should hire an agency, or experienced contractor who will do this for us.  However, our newly hired business manager is pushing a person he used to work with. He used to push this guy since beginning (few weeks ago), he apparently knows ruby php,  python , css, jquery, you name it.  Young lad in his early 20s. 

When we decided we want the app, the business manager jumped in and said that this guy can do this for us. When I asked - does he know iOS development. 'Oh yeah he knows everything""

I am all for supporting previous colleagues, and hiring juniors willing to learn, as well as  promoting young protégées but I am sincerely doubtful, that a person at his age is experienced at every single thing that I mention, yet still ""currently not busy"" . On same token - I am aware that good nad passionate programmers will pick up any language, given time. But that's not the point - we need someone who  knows the code already and will do his job professionally as we need the app in short time;  not someone who will spend time google coding. I can find dozen of people (including myslef and my team members) who can do that.

Cut the long story short,  I decided to give this guy  benefit of doubt and to do the interview with him.

My knowledge of iOS app development is very limited. So,  what questions should I ask an novice  iOS developer that has done at least something? . Or rather what is a fundamental thing every iOS developer that has ever done anything close to iOS development  has to know? (i.e. Activity Life cycle in Android,  data sanitization in web development, etc)

Is it unreasonable for example, to ask about how Apples push notifications work? etc..
