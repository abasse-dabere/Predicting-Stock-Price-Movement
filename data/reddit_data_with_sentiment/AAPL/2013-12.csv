iphone,Photos taking up too much space? Here's something that might help some.,"When I bought my iPhone, I ended up getting the 16GB, with my music and photos I barely had any storage left over to do anything else.  I have about 2500 photos from over the last few years and each was about 2.5mb, which was taking up roughly 6-7GB of storage.  

I know I had the option to back up the photos and leave storage space on my phone, but I didn't want to do that because I will usually take a photo of some important information which I will eventually need to refer to in the future.  Also sometimes I want to share some moments with friends/family, so I want to have the photos with me at any given time.  

So here is the solution I came up with.  I decided to extract all the photos from my phone and keep them backed up on my computer.  Then to reduce the size of the images to 25% of the original.  I don't really need an 3264x2448 resolution photo with me at all time.  Reducing it to 25% of the original left me with a resolution of 816x612, which still looks great on a 4 inch screen.  This leaves me with the originals in full resolutions on my computer if I ever need to refer to them and a smaller version of them on my phone, saving me a ton of storage space.

Here is the procedure I used - **First** download [iFunBox](http://dl.i-funbox.com/) - This will allow you to extract you photos from your camera roll simply by dragging and dropping.  **Second** download [irfanview](http://www.irfanview.com/) - This program allows you to re-size all your photos at once, it gives you the option to re-size by percentage as I did, or to re-size to a specific resolution while maintaining proportion.  [Here is a YouTube video on how to re-size multiple images using Irfanview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-RrrmCT0Co)

I know this method isn't for everyone, but i hope it can help some people out.

**TLDR;** To save storage consumed by photos on your phone, use software to re-size all you images to smaller resolution to keep on your phone while keeping original resolution backed up on your computer.",37,37,2013-12-04,AAPL,0.03540528193116188,0.9297906160354614,0.03480410948395729

apple,2012 Macbook Air supports 4K monitor (3840x2160),"This past week I purchased a Seiki for my MacBook Pro Retina . Just for fun I connected the monitor to my 2012 MacBook Air and to my surprise found out that the MBA supports an external resolution of 3840x2160. I was amazed! All the documentation that I've seen only says it only supports 2560x1440 externally. Apple has yet again surpassed my expectations.

One additional note, the refresh rate is capped at 30hz so it isn't might meant for gaming. But videos on youtube looks great and I can't tell a difference. Hope this info helps out the people that are thinking about moving to 4k.

EDIT: correcting wrong word.  I wanted to share this info with /r/apple because the impression I got from the web was that you needed a Macbook Pro Retina to run at 4k, which isn't true.

However, I've called every day for a week and was told their authentication servers are down and there is nothing that can be done except to wait.  This has left my copy of Office 2011 in read only mode and work is piling up.

I want to know what you personally do with your old device when you upgrade to a new one. I'm not looking for advice, more just curious what method is used by this general population of smart and tech-aware people.

Do you spend the time and effort to sell it on eBay or Craigslist yourself?

Do you trade it in for next to nothing at Apple?

Do you sell it to a site such as Gazelle for slightly more?

And how has your experience been with these avenues? 

The reason I ask, is because I am creating a startup in this niche. I am NOT plugging it here because I would hate to see that myself, but I am trying to create the best way to do this. I am truly curious what someone like YOU does with their old phone/tablet, and what your experience has been.

iphone,Just released my new app - Party DJ lets you and your friends vote to queue up music,"Hi /r/iphone - I've just launched my new app Party DJ, it shuffles all your music (or just music from chosen playlists), and allows friends with smartphones and tablets to vote on what music to listen to next.  It includes a built in web server, so your friends with non-iOS devices can connect and vote via their browser.  (So it doesn't leave your Android-using friends out)

* Party DJ can shuffle your whole iOS music library, or only songs from playlists of your choice.
* Non-iOS users (eg. Android &amp; Windows Phone users) can vote too, using a web interface.
* If you don’t have a Wi-Fi connection available, iOS 7 users can still connect and vote using Peer-to-Peer Bluetooth - great for playing music on road trips!
* Party guests can add music from their own library into the queue, if the host allows it.
* A free companion app can be used by guests to vote on music, only the host has to buy the main app.

It's really good fun with friends and family, so should be ideal for Christmas.

Here's the website for the app:  http://pdj.fm

And a link to the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/party-dj/id705873160?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4G5&amp;ct=reddit

apple,iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor sums up Apple products pretty well,"Just a thought -

I thought it would be a gimmick - it wasn't even a factor when I decided to get a 5S, but it's actually made a big difference to how much I enjoy using my phone. It's everything that Apple products represent:

- It's a feature that we never thought we'd need or appreciate - this is what is meant by Apple's 'innovative' approach; Apple doesn't just follow markets (all the time) it creates them.

- it was done well. It's probably not the first mobile device fingerprint sensor in history, but by god it's polished enough to feel like they've been mainstream for ages.

- it's understated - in the sense that it makes your experience of using the phone so much more pleasurable without being in your face or directly measurable. It fades into the background and works without constantly reminding you it's there.

I was once asked if my 5s was good and I didn't even mention the fingerprint sensor - it's so seamless and natural that I almost forgot what life is like without it.

iphone,Moving from Android to iOS: My experience. (xpost from /r/android),"Some days ago, my galaxy S2 kicked the bucket, and after almost 4 years of using android, I decided that my next phone was going to be an iPhone 5S. 

I’ve noticed that, while there’s a lot written about switching from iOS to android, there’s a lack of information regarding the opposite switch. So, here’s a “review” of my experience.


First of all, a small parenthesis: Why I decided to switch?


Probably, Android users are wondering why would anybody with an interest in technology switch from android to a more closed system. Some of you may have already decided to tag me as dumb and stop reading; but, for those of you who have an open mind, here are some of my reasons:


-	**I aspire to become a developer**, and learning to develop for iOS is a very valuable skill that could land me a job. Owning an iPhone can definitely help me learn.
- **I wanted something different** for my next phone, after using android for 4 years.


-	**Wakelocks.** The amount of battery drained from android devices while they’re inactive in your pocket is incredible. In order to try to control that you need to be aware of every app you install, and messing with wakelock detectors and Greenify. I’m kind of tired of that situation.
-**	Lack of aesthetical cohesion.** Thankfully, Holo has fixed that to some extent (praised be Duarte), but Nexus users aside, the manufacturer’s changes  into the OS  still make the environment quite ugly, in my opinion.
-	**Camera.** I want a good camera in my phone, and while there are some awesome android devices in that aspect, they’re all too large for my taste.
With that sorted out, let’s get into the actual experience. I’ve divided this post in three subsections: The iPhone itself, iOS, and the apps.


**The iPhone**


I’m not going to get into much detail regarding the hardware, since the interesting part about my post is the OS switch. So, let me just outline some details; you can skip this part if you’re not interested.


-	**The phone is beautiful and well built.** Nothing surprising here, as design is always one of Apple’s strong points.
-	**It seems really fragile.** My old galaxy S2 fell dozens of times, including falling down an escalator, or into my dog’s full water bowl (all without a protective case), and it took it like a champ. My new 5S doesn’t seem to be capable of that at all. Then again, the iPhone is probably the smallest flagship in the market, so using a protective case isn’t a big deal: You can still keep it in your pocket and use it with one hand with no trouble.
-	**The screen’s form factor is a little weird**. Getting used to it is easy, but it is not a nice size to use in portrait mode.
-	The sound is good, but **placing your hand near the speaker** (bottom of the phone) **leaves the phone completely muted.**
-	**There’s something weird going on with touch detection.** It’s like it doesn’t detect the position of your fingers in the same way android does. I even went as far as to think that my screen wasn’t calibrated correctly; but after getting used to it, I think it’s just different for some reason.


**IOS and system apps**


Just random thoughts that may be of importance to android users wanting to switch:


-	**It is incredibly smooth,** even compared to my friend’s Nexus 5. I have a feeling that it is not only because of the OS being fast; system animations are better.
-	 **I don’t like having ads in my phone’s settings.** The phone has Twitter, Facebook, Vimeo, Flickr, and Nike + Ipod in the Settings menu. The OS is well integrated with those services, and that’s fine; but keeping them constantly visible even if I choose not to install them makes it look like an ad.
-	Coming from android, **the lack of a back button is weird**. Thanks to the iPhone’s small size, having the back button on top isn’t very annoying, although it makes me wonder what is apple going to do when/if they release a larger phone, because this design is clearly not scalable.
-	**Touch ID (the new fingerprint technology) is awesome**. It works flawlessly and fast, making it probably the best option to lock your phone. However, that’s only true for the iPhone 5S: All the other iPhones are inferior to android in this aspect, as they lack the option of pattern unlock.
-	**App settings are a little confusing**.  For some apps, they’re in the main screen. For others, they’re integrated into system settings. I liked more the android way of having them in the overflow button, which is funny because the trend right now is getting rid of that button.
-	**Stock sounds and wallpapers are much better in iOS** (taste is subjective, but that’s my impression).
-	**The camera is really really good.** Quality is good, but what makes me admire it is the speed: There’s just no comparison. I don’t get why the option to show the grid is in settings, instead of easily accessible in the app (it might just be an option I’m not aware of).
-	**The keyboard takes a lot to get used to**, coming from swipe-style keyboards. I get that apple doesn’t allow third party keyboards for security reasons, but they need to at least improve their stock keyboard. I don’t get why the corrector doesn’t “understand” slang or cuss words, when the voice-to-text recognizes them perfectly. 
-	About voice commands: **Siri is worlds ahead of Google now**. However, I have my iPhone set in Spanish, so for English speakers, your mileage may vary. **Using voice to text is, however, worse in iOS**, because it doesn’t recognize any punctuation signs (which is something android does, IIRC).
-	**Control Center is nice**, as a general idea,**but the specific controls implemented on it don’t make much sense** to me: Why would you put there the calculator, for example? I don’t see a situation where you urgently need a calculator and you can’t wait to look for the icon. And by the way, why is Siri incapable of doing math? “what’s the Square root of 35” should be answered with a result, not with a web search. 


**Third party apps**

These are relevant details I’ve come across:


-	This is important for whatsapp android users: If you’ve ever moved to a new phone and/or are used to install new ROMs, you probably know that whatsapp does a backup of your conversations every day at 4 am, and you can restore that backup while reinstalling. Well,**this backup won’t be available in iOS.**
-	**Google apps are hit or miss:** For example, while Google+ and YouTube are equal or better than their android counterparts, Hangouts still hasn’t been updated to iOS7, and Keep doesn’t even exist in iOS. By the way, if anyone knows a way to export my Google Keep notes to an iOS app, I would appreciate your help.
-	With all the talks about sandboxing, I was worried that dropbox would become useless, since I store pdfs and docs with school notes there, to study on the go. However,**I can read all my Dropbox documents just fine**; I guess the app includes its own document reader.
-	**The general quality of apps is much better** than in android. However, **I miss certain kind of apps:** Particularly, I’m going to miss emulators.

That's all I can think of right now. I'll update if I find something else worth mentioning.",90,111,2013-12-20,AAPL,0.04447812959551811,0.9216364026069641,0.03388549480587244

Fast forward, finally got a bigger disk but can't backup onto new disk because of errors on internal drive. System still under AppleCare, but how to backup data so that the internal drive can be replaced?  )Thank you Genius Bar appointment.)

Solution: Connect old and new drives to system.  Open Disk Utility and ensure that the new drive is the same format as the old drive. Select the old backup drive and click the restore tab.  Set the destination to your new drive, and hit the restore button.  When finished, set Time Machine to use new drive for backups, and proceed as usual.

I got lucky with this solution in my situation.  It was the least invasive solution, and it worked.  Had my Time Machine backup still failed, I would have needed to install the OS to an external drive, boot from it, and then use Time Machine to backup my internal drive to a different drive.  Failing that, I would need to use ""ditto"" to replicate the drive and ignore any bad blocks.

TL;DR: Use Disk Utility to restore old backup disk to larger new disk.",16,167,2013-12-24,AAPL,0.06694862991571426,0.8937472701072693,0.03930411860346794

apple,Sluggish IOS7 Spotlight? Disable indexing of stuff you don't care about.,"I have an iPad Mini Retina and the only thing sluggish about it was the Spotlight opening animation. 

I primarily use Spotlight for its ""Search web"" and ""Search wikipedia"" feature. It works great for this purpose because I don't have to waste two taps going into Safari before beginning a google search. 

However Spotlight was also indexing stuff I didn't care about-- music, messages, podcasts, videos, etc. I set it to the bare bones: Applications, contacts, notes, events. You can decide on your own what you don't need indexed. The key is to remove unnecessary stuff.

hi there
Well, I think after reading all these posts from desperate people trying to get their superdrive working properly and all seems that doesn't work and having to replace it spending 100s of bucks, I'm gonna tell you how to to fix it really easy and CLEAN, lol...I had to share this with you, folks!

What you need is a business card or a credit card + iPhone cleaning cloth (other similar cleaning cloth that's thin and doesn't leave marks for example for cleaning glasses). Wrap the cloth around the credit card, then while holding the ends of the the cloth insert few centimeters from the front of the credit card covered with the cloth in the optical drive, push and pull a bit and that's about it. The drive will work perfectly and like new 
You don't need to insert it so much since the lens is not so deep inside. It's just few cm in.

well, that's about it...
Stay well and enjoy it now!

apple,Finally found a solution to my disk space problems on the new Macbook Air,"Since I picked up the base model Macbook Air 2013 I've been hoping for an affordable solution to expand the disk space. We're almost 6 months since release and nobody has created an alternative part for the PCI-e SSDs that Apple is now using in all(?) of their new Macs. The only solutions so far have been tracking down a pulled 256 or 512GB Apple part (super expensive), expanding through the [Nifty Minidrive](http://theniftyminidrive.com) (very cool, but micro SD is slow and maxes out at 64GB), or expanding through the PNY StorEdge (faster and bigger capacity than micro SD but not cheap at $200 for 128GB). OWC says they're working on a replacement PCI-e SSD but nothing has surfaced yet and it will likely be pricey when it finally does come around.

Anyway, I've been on the fence on either of the SD-based solutions and my 128GB SSD was feeling increasingly cramped. Last week I got a price alert on the [128GB storedge card](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DC9U2Q8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DC9U2Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=facebookc0fcb-20). Down to $79! So I grabbed one for my MBA. I've since moved my iTunes and iPhoto libraries to the SD card and the performance is perfect for those applications. I'm actually thinking about getting another 128GB card for my older MBP.

Anyway, just thought I'd share my experience in case there are others in the same situation. If you're feeling cramped on one of the new SSDs this is a good option to get some added space without breaking the bank.

apple,My MacBook Air story,"I bought an MacBook Air for my wife for Christmas.  I bought a refurb, since money was a little tight and the 15% discount helped a great deal.

Then Christmas came and we opened it up.  Did the Mavericks upgrade and found out the P key was a little messed up.

Dragged it to the Apple Store.  The guy told me it would need a top case replacement, which would take a week, since they don't have the part.  They couldn't swap it, because it was a refurb, and they told me to call 1-800-MY-APPLE.

The gentleman on the phone told me I would need to ship it back to Apple to get a replacement.  So, my sad wife packed up the Air in it's original box and we tossed it into a FedEx box around 3:30 PM yesterday.

Apple shipped the replacement THIS MORNING.  Soon as they saw the tracking number go active, they assumed that the Mac was on it's way back to them and sent out the replacement.  FedEx tracking says it will be here on Monday.

What could have been a pretty long wait for my wife for her replacement MacBook Air, turned into a weekend wait.
