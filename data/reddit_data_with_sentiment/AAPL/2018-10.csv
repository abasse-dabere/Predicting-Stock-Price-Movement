apple,Apple should implement FaceTime audio like iMessage. Practically all iPhone to iPhone calls would have way better call quality.,"I don’t know why they have held off on implementing FaceTime audio like iMessage. 

If two iPhones are signed in and on to use FaceTime, then calls get routed to FaceTime audio and over WiFi/LTE instead of regular cellular calls. They can also implement a way to switch in real time back to cellular if data becomes an issue while on the call (similar to how WiFi calling works)

The audio quality would greatly be improved for those calls. It’s so much nicer.

A warning message will appear telling you the website may be showing you a fake keyboard to trick you into disclosing personal or financial information. [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/cn5gXqi.jpg)

apple,Apple really undersold the A12 CPU. It's almost caught up to desktop chips at this point. Here's a breakdown [OC]:,"This is a long post. The title is basically the Tl;Dr... if you care about the details, read on :) 

I was intrigued by the Anantech comparison of the A12 with a Xeon 8176 on Spec2006, so I decided to find more spec benchmarks for other chips and run them.

------------------

## Comparisons to Xeon 8192, i7 6700k, and AMD EPYC 7601 CPUs. 

**Notes:** All results are Single-Core. If the processor is multithreaded, I tried finding the Multithreaded results. In the case of Big+Little configurations (like the A12) one Big core was used. The 6700k was the fastest Intel desktop chip I could find on the Spec2006 database. 

Spec_Int 2006|Example|Apple A12^[1]|Xeon 8176^[3]|i7 6700k^[2]|EPYC 7601^[3]|
:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:

483.xalancbmk|XML processing|57.0|**75.3**|74.0|37.8

The main takeaway here is that Apple’s A12 is approaching or exceeding the performance of these competing chips in Spec2006, with lower clock speeds and less power consumption. The A12 BIG core running at 2.5GHz beats a Xeon 8176 core running at 3.8GHz, in 9 out of 12 of Spec_Int 2006 tests, often by a large margin (up to 44%). It falls behind in 3 tests, but the deficiency is 2%, 6%, and 12%. It also comes quite close to a desktop 6700k.

**No adjustment was made to normalize the results by clock speed.** Core-for-Core Apple’s A12 has a **a higher IPC** and **at least 50% better Perf/Watt** than competing chips, even with the advantage of SMT on some of these! (Apple doesn’t use SMT in the A-series chips currently).

----------------

## CPU Width

&gt; Monsoon (A11) and Vortex (A12) are extremely wide machines – with 6 integer execution pipelines among which two are complex units, two load units and store units, two branch ports, and three FP/vector pipelines this gives an estimated 13 execution ports, far wider than Arm’s upcoming Cortex A76 and also wider than Samsung’s M3. In fact, assuming we're not looking at an atypical shared port situation, **Apple’s microarchitecture seems to far surpass anything else in terms of width, including desktop CPUs.**

— [Anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets/3)

By comparison, Zen and Coffee Lake have 6-wide decode + 4Int ALU per core. Here are the WikiChip block diagrams: [Zen/Zen+](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/microarchitectures/zen#Individual_Core) and [Coffee Lake](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/microarchitectures/coffee_lake#Individual_Core) Even IBM's [Power9](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/ibm/microarchitectures/power9#Pipeline) is 6-wide.

Why does this matter? 

**width** in this case refers to Issue Width on the CPU μArch. Or ""how many commands can I issue to this CPU per cycle.**The wider your issue-width on a CPU, the more you instructions can be issued at once.** By stacking these instructions very close to one another, you can achieve multiple instructions per Cycle, resulting in a **higher IPC**. This has drawbacks -- it requires longer wire length, as the electrons need to travel more to execute all the instructions and because you're doing so many things at once, the design complexity of the CPU increases. You also need to do things like reorder instructions so they'll better fit, and you need larger caches to keep the cores fed. On that note... 

## Cache sizes (per core) are quite large on the A12

Per core we have:

* On the A12: Each Big core has 128kB of L1$ and 8MB L2$. each Little core has 32kB of L1$ and 2MB of L2$. There’s also an additional 8 MB of SoC-wide$ (also used for other things)
* On EPYC 7601: 64kB L1$, 32kB L1D$, 512 KB L2$, 2MB shared L3$ (8 MB per 4-core complex)  
* On Xeon 8176: 32kB L1$, 32kB L1D$, 1MB shared L2$, 1.375MB shared L3$
* On 6700k: 128kB L1$, 128kB L1D$, 1MB L2$, 2MB shared L3$

What Apple has done is implement a really wide μArch, combined with a metric fuckton of dedicated per-core cache, as well as a decently large 8MB Shared cache. This is likely necessary to keep the 7-wide cores fed.

-----------

## RISC vs CISC

Tl;Dr: RISC vs CISC is now a moot point. At its core, CISC was all about having the CPU execute commands in as few lines of code as possible (sparing lots of memory/cache). RISC was all about diluting all commands into a series of commands which could each be executed in a single cycle, allowing for better pipelining. The tradeoff was more cache requirements and memory usage (which is why the A12 cache is so big per core), plus very compiler intensive code. 

RISC is better for power consumption, but historically CISC was better for performance/$, because memory prices were high and cache sizes were limited (as larger die-area came at a high cost due to low transistor density). **This is no longer the case** on modern process nodes. In modern computing, both of these ISAs have evolved to the point where they now emulate each other’s features to a degree, in order to mitigate weaknesses each ISA. [This IEE paper from 2013](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6522302) elaborates a bit more. 

The main findings from this study are (I have access to the full paper): 

1. Large performance gaps exist across the implementations, although average cycle count gaps are ≤2.5×.
2. Instruction count and mix are **ISA-independent** to first order.
3. Performance differences are generated by **ISA-independent** microarchitecture differences.
4. The energy consumption is again **ISA-independent.**
5. ISA differences have implementation implications, but **modern microarchitecture techniques render them moot**; one ISA is not fundamentally more efficient.
6. ARM and x86 implementations are simply design points optimized for different performance levels.  

In general there is no computing advantage that comes from a particular ISA anymore, The advantages come from μArch choices and design optimization choices. Comparing ISA’s directly is okay, as long **as your benchmark is good**. Spec2006 is far better than geekbench for x-platform comparisons, and Is regularly used for ARM vs x86 server chip comparisons. Admittedly, not all the workloads are as relevant to general computing, but it does give us a good idea of where the A12 lands, compared to desktop CPUs. 

----------

## Unanswered Questions:

We do not know if Apple will Scale up the A-series chips for laptop or desktop use. For one thing, **the question of multicore scaling remains unanswered**. Another question is how well the chips will handle a Frequency ramp-up (IPC will scale, of course, but how will power consumption fare?) This also doesn't look at scheduler performance because there's nothing to schedule on a single-thread workload running on 1 core. So Scheduler performance remains largely unknown.

But, based on power envelopes alone, Apple could already make an A12X based 3-core fanless MacBook with 11W power envelope, and throw in 6 little cores for efficiency. The battery life would be amazing. In a few generations, they might be able to do this with a higher end MacBook Pro, throwing 8 (29W) big cores, just based on the current thermals and cooling systems available. 

In any case, **the A12 has almost caught up to x86 desktop and server CPUs** (Keep in mind that Intel’s desktop chips are faster than their laptop counterparts) Given Apple's insane rate of CPU development, and their commitment to being on the latest and best process nodes available, **I predict that Apple will pull ahead in the next 2 generations, and in 3 years we could see the first ARM Mac**, lining up with the potential release of Marzipan, allowing for iOS-first (and therefore ARM-first) universal apps to be deployed across the ecosystem.

apple,iPhone X survived 8 hours submerged on the sea floor. I was able to recover it later in the day using find my iPhone!,"Crazy story.

I was enjoying some water sports with my soon to be fiance who I was planning to propose to 2 hours after this happened. We decided to take the iPhone out to take some photos of us kayaking and stand up paddle boarding on the beach (yes probably a stupid idea). So I had my iPhone in my pocket as I got up on the stand up paddle board and I fell backwards into the water. That was when it struck me. My phone was no longer in my pocket.

After desperately trying to relocate the phone using snorkeling gear lol it quickly dawned upon us that there was no way we were going to find the phone amongst all the rocks and debris on the ocean floor. Plus I figured that the phone will probably be water damaged before long being submerged in salty sea water. Furthermore, radiowaves can't penetrate water so my phone immedately lost reception meaning we weren't able to call it or use find my iPhone.

This was obviousy a massive downer for me but I brushed it off. After all I was planning on proposing.

So I went ahead with the proposal and it went really well :) had a celebratory dinner on the beach. I would occasionally look out to the ocean knowing that my iPhone was sitting on the ocean floor but I wasn't going to let that ruin the night for me.

When we finally returned home I decided to try find my iPhone again. This was T+8 hours post fall into water. The tide had gone out a bit so I was hoping that the seas would part and my phone would get signal again.

Lo and behold I got a signal!

So we raced down to the beach and I played the sonar sound through find my iPhone and was able to locate it amongst the rocks. 66% battery left haha.

To my surprise it was in perfect working condition! We quickly took it back home and put it in some rice and I haven't had any problems with it since.

Thanks apple for creating such a sturdy product in the iPhone X and the amazing find my iphone app. It was the icing on the cake to a perfect day!

TLDR:

Dropped phone in ocean 2 hours before proposal. Did said propsal anyway. She said yes! Used find my iPhone to relocate phone on the ocean floor once the tide had come out 8 hours after being submerged in water in perfect working condition. WINNING.

EDIT:
Just to clarify things... 
1. When I found it again it wasn’t underwater anymore as it was low tide and it had fallen in at high tide
2. It was approx 1m underwater when it fell in 
3. Water sports means water sports lol ...

apple,Louis Rossmann admits to using parts from a factory in China that wasn't authorized to manufacture the batteries seized (Proof inside),"Louis Rossman's account posted [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/9pd7xo/apple_used_ice_to_seize_louis_rossmanns_shipment/e81th4f/?context=3) in another subreddit -- copy/pasted below and [screenshotted here](https://i.imgur.com/J4czpVp.png) in case he takes it down...

&gt; ""Or they show that a factory that was contracted to make these batteries continued doing so after the contract ran out, but still used apple's logo""

&gt; This is most likely.

&gt; A lot of the times, companies will try out 10 or 20 different factories before going to a final one for production. People will spend hundreds of thousands tooling up to make one part, only to lose a bid or have a contract end early. they have two choices

&gt; 1. Consider it a failed investment
&gt; 2. Produce the parts to original specification, and sell them to Americans who have no choice as the OEM won't sell them the part for any amount of money anyway.

&gt; So many of these people are making jack shit wages as it is to pump out a 230millionth macbook keyboard or whatever. If they want to make one and sell it to me and I'll pay them something worth it, they will. Whether Apple says they can or not, given that they are being paid shit, matters not to them.

&gt; And it doesn't matter much to me either.

Here is [his second comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/9pe9yd/us_customs_border_protection_seizes_louis/e81sp9s/?context=3) which is also backed up as a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/PLVmNiW.png). It’s a bit long so I’m only quoting the relevant part below (not the entire comment), because I think this is the most damning bit: 

&gt;  Usually I ask them to sharpie out the Apple logo, and usually they do. Problem solved. Why that did not happen here is beyond me.
​
&gt; Maybe they did, but the dude at customs was smart enough to realize black sharpie on black plastic this time.

So he knows these batteries have apple logos on them (making them counterfeit)... and *asks his supplier to sharpie the logos out* ಠ_ಠ  

And keep in mind, this is coming straight from his Reddit account. 

------------------

###Regarding the comment above

First of all, let me start by saying, **I am not defending Apple's terrible stance towards Right to Repair**. However, I do have an issue with people not being completely transparent, misrepresenting the truth, and then blaming apple for something completely unrelated. 

Lous Rossman, **on his own reddit account** in a comment, says that he commissioned the batteries from a factory in China **that was no longer authorized to make those batteries**, because likely they lost the bid/contract to do so. 

He then goes on to say that: 

&gt; If they want to make one and sell it to me and I'll pay them something worth it, they will. Whether Apple says they can or not .... And it doesn't matter much to me either. 

Which is fine. He can do what he wants.

Here's the thing... If you break the law, and import counterfeit parts, and then custom seizes them, **You cannot blame Apple for that** -- Regardless of apple's stance on Right to Repair, **Louis broke the law.** Customs came after you for breaking said law. Customs is not apple's watchdog, nor are they somehow beholden to apple, nor are they lashing out against him, because Apple told them to go after him. Customs does not care about the MORALITY of his fight in favor of Right to Repair (which IMO is a good thing to fight for), They care about the LEGALITY of what Louis doing, and what you did was not legal... 

Posting a video blaming Apple for what Customs did to seize the shipment grossly misrepresents the situation... and then calming ""they are apple batteries"" further muddies the water. If the factory that makes these ""exact copies"" of Apple batteries does not have a contract to do so, then you shouldn't be commissioning them to make said batteries. 

Tl;Dr: **The claim that Apple is somehow using Customs to sealclub the Rossman group is unfounded, and incorrect**

-----------------

###On Apple and Right to Repair.

**I think Apple's R2R policy is awful** - It sucks that once the device you buy is on the ""obsolete"" list, you can no longer get 1st party service from Apple. Not only that, but there are no **legal** ways to obtain parts. IMO this is something **all of us** should be putting pressure on Apple to change. I'd love it if there was a law on the books that forced companies to make spare parts for products available to customers for x amount of years after the warranty expires. That would allow people to continue using the devices they buy. 

But just because apple's policy sucks, doesn't give anyone a license to break import/export laws, even if morally correct. Sometimes, legality and morality do not line up. **In those cases, it's advisable that people put pressure on lawmakers, so the law is changed.** 

In closing, **I'm going to continue supporting Louis, iFixit, and their attempts to secure our rights to repair the products we own.** But I also believe in calling people out when they misrepresent something in order to demonize the other side. All it does is weaken the integrity behind the claims they are making, which will ultimately *hurt* their own arguments when they push in favor of Right to Repair.

apple,Something amazing Apple never gets credit for: impedance memory,"You know how when you have an aux cable plugged into your phone you keep the volume all the way up, then you go to plug your headphones in later and get your ears blown up? Apple doesn't let that happen. They recognize the impedance of a device connected to the jack (built-in or Lightning dongle!) and set the volume to the last one you had set. I discovered this feature comparing a new set of headphones, the Beyerdynamic DT 990 250Ω, with my old earbuds on an iPhone SE. The headphones were much harder to drive and I needed my volume at around 60-70% compared to 20-30% for the earbuds. I was able to swap between them and the volume went up and down back to whatever I had set last time they were in. This is an amazing feature and Apple deserves more credit for it, especially for keeping it despite removing the headphone jack. I'd highly encourage you to test it out and see how clever the feature is. Thank you Apple!",160,1241,2018-10-19,AAPL,0.031426072120666504,0.9163015484809875,0.05227231979370117

apple,Notes may be the most underappreciated native Apple app,"I've tried many different note-taking apps over the years - everything from Evernote to Bear. 

Apple Notes has long been an acceptable free option but a bit lacking in features compared to other note-taking apps.

But over the years Apple Notes has seen incremental improvements that, in my opinion, has made it the best note-taking app available for basic note-taking purposes.

Here's what I appreciate about the app:

* Simple, clean interface. All features are easily accessible and easy to understand.

* Extremely easy to change the style and the size of text on the fly.

* NOT a markdown editor. (I understand this is a negative for some people. Personally, I am not a fan of markdown. I prefer using simple command key combinations to mark up text).

* Has gotten to the point that it has every essential note-taking feature (collaboration, locking, multiple windows, pinned notes, dark mode, etc.)

* Available for iOS, Mac, Internet browser.

* FREE if you already own Apple products (yes, I understand that's a big *""if""* and that you're probably not going to want to use this unless you use iOS / macOS devices as your primary devices).

For my purposes, Apple Notes is a nearly flawless app (aside from a lack of watchOS support). It's really nice to have such a useful app come standard with every Apple device.",144,343,2018-10-25,AAPL,0.02882113680243492,0.9378786683082581,0.0333002507686615

apple,"[Self Promotion Saturday] I just released version 1.3 of my Reddit app Apollo! The main focus of the update is (finally) notifications! Bunch of other goodies as well, details inside!","Almost exactly a year ago I released Apollo and you all were amazing. Just wanted to say a wholehearted thanks for making this last year so amazing, and I'm stoked for the years to come. I've got a ton planned.

Today Apollo 1.3 is available! It brings probably the most requested feature at this point: notifications. It also brings some other awesome features such as App Theming, and a new custom icon. Also a ton of bug fixes as well (notably around that dang cache bug, sorry about that). 

### Apollo 1.3

Notifications have been notably absent from Apollo from the get-go, but it's been because they're a really hard thing to do, and to do right. Long story short, there's a few ways to do them. You can do it completely on device, but this affects device battery life, and causes substantial delays in delivery as it can only fetch so often. An option that fixes these downsides is to do all the work on an external server, which doesn't affect battery life, and results in instant delivery. [Here's a video of Scott Forstall talking about server advantages way back in iPhone OS 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fMDdmcsaU)

On top of all this, recent versions of iOS really also souped up the power of what notifications can do on the device, but weirdly a lot of apps don't take advantage of that (look at iMessage for an app that does, how you can view your messages and reply inline).

For Apollo, I really didn't want to cut corners, so I've spent the last few months building up a really awesome solution with a dedicated server to handle the notifications, as well as taking advantage of everything iOS has to offer for making notifications powerful. The result is Apollo notifications are super battery efficient, super fast, and crazy powerful. You can view an entire conversation's context from the notification, reply, upvote, downvote, and more without ever having to leave the lockscreen. You can even customize the sound of the notification, I like making it sound like a turkey gobble. It's like a mini-app in itself.

Now, to be completely up front with you, servers have ongoing, monthly costs. Yeah, there's no getting around that unfortunately. I'd love to just say ""here, everyone who has Pro gets notifications!"" but where I made Pro a small, one-time fee, the notifications server and its ongoing costs mean that I'd eventually be in the red on that exchange, and keeping Apollo sustainable and healthy for the future is obviously a massive priority of mine. I want to keep the lights on.

On the flipside, I 100% know, understand and agree with [how most feel about subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8hk2tr/app_subscriptions_suck/). They're abused more and more lately, and they're expensive. So [I talked it over with the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/8k6mkl/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and/) and I wanted to come up with a reasonable solution to help pay for ongoing server costs, without gouging customers and infuriating them with something crappy.

I knew I couldn't compete with Netflix and whatnot and add another $10/month subscription to users, but as said servers have ongoing costs to me, so I elected to offer an option in the app to pay a meager 99 cents a month and you can have full access to notifications. I really hope you guys can find this reasonable and know I put a ton of work and talk into this update to make it as reasonable as I possibly could. I've worked really hard over the last year to work with the community on Apollo, so please understand that I honestly do really care about the community, and I hope my actions over the last year speak to that even more than my words.

### Show me a video of the features!

Okay! https://vimeo.com/297431875

### So how do I get notifications?

Notifications are bundled into a new pack called ""Apollo Ultra"". Hold up! Why not just call it ""Apollo Notifications""? Well, I did that at first, but it [didn't go so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/). Essentially Apple has a rule (3.2.2 subsection ii) that apps can't charge directly for system capabilities like push notifications. Apple very nicely called me and explained that they know there's associated costs with push notifications and the server required for them, but to prevent potential abuse this is a rule they have. They suggested to bundle it in with other features that aren't system capabilities (eg don't bundle it in with AirPlay streaming), and after [talking with the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/) we came up with some simple cool features to add to it that aren't massive deals if you don't have: App Theming (changing the colors of the app around), and some more custom app icons. So the end result is Apollo Ultra is a pack that has notifications, App Theming, and a new custom icon every month.

### What does it notify me of?

It notifies you of everything in your Reddit inbox: post replies, comment replies, username mentions, and private messages.

### Walk me through your process of building this update.

I started with a [thread in the ApolloApp subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/8k6mkl/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and/) talking about my plans and to see if it made sense. People seemed to understand the costs and like my concept, so I started building. Then [I got some feedback on the UI](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/91d5pr/notifications_does_this_ui_make_sense_to_yall/) to make sure it was clear and understandable. Fast forward a bit, it had been tested by the community and everyone seemed to like it, so I submitted it to Apple, and [it was unfortunately rejected](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/) (but Apple was cool). People gave some suggestions and ideas. I talked with the community and [laid out my plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9muoml/hey_ill_be_less_available_for_the_next_7_days/). I talked to Apple on the phone [and they were super cool and basically agreed with the plans so I updated the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9ontns/update_on_apollo_13_and_plans_for_it/) and got to work. I then submitted it, and Apple approved it! And here we are.

### Apollo Pro?

I want to be really, really, really clear that Apollo Pro is not going anywhere, not only that, but it's still the main part of Apollo, and will continue to be indefinitely. Zero plans to change that. So many of you supported Apollo right out of the gates, and the last thing I want to do is give the middle finger to a group of people I owe a ton to. Apollo Ultra is an optional, separate pack that you can get if you want, or ignore if you want. But I have zero plans to move the core of Apollo to a subscription model. The one-time fee model works great, and everyone seems to love it. I don't have any plans to be locking a bunch of extra features into Ultra, and on the flipside I have some really awesome extra features planned for Pro.

### Other notification options?

I mentioned the first option up there uses the device to manage notifications, it uses a combination of Background App Refresh and Local Notifications. Effectively it wakes the app up every so often to make fetches to the server to see if there's any new notifications. This has some downsides, notably that all this is performed on the device, which negatively affects battery life (for instance Apple turns this capability off during Low Power Mode). Further, this fetching can only happen periodically (it varies and is decided by iOS, can be 15 minutes to every several hours in frequency) so the notifications themselves can be quite delayed. I had this as an option called ""Basic Notifications"" in the previous build that was rejected, but don't worry, I plan to add it as an option back, I just wanted to make sure when I submitted this new build everything was clear to Apple and I didn't add any more confusion to potentially get it delayed further. So if you're okay with the above downsides, Apollo will also have a free option for notifications, so please understand that I'm truly trying to be as reasonable about this as possible!

### You could merge Pro and Ultra?

I don't really want to move the Pro features to a subscription model, I like how they are now. It would be more streamlined to just have one ""pack"", yes, but I think in the end this will make everyone happier. For this reason you also don't ""automatically"" get Pro if you get Ultra, because I don't want to conflate the two, and it introduces a lot of complexity around whether or not it should be removed after the subscription expires.

### Still don't like subscriptions, any other options?

You don't have to go by the month (99c), there's a cheaper yearly option for $10, or for a limited time if you really don't like subscriptions there's a lifetime unlock for $20. That price will last for 1 week from today, so act quick if you want it!

### I don't want notifications but still want the other stuff or to support you

You can totally get Apollo Ultra and just leave notifications turned off if they're not your cup of tea, you'll still get everything else and help Apollo's development!

### Tell me about this custom icon every month.

So I figured if I was going to add extra custom icons (which everyone seems to love) to Ultra, I didn't want to just lazily throw in one I threw together in a few minutes. So I worked with The Iconfactory and commissioned them [to build a super sick custom icon](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9rd6jp/the_iconfactory_bringing_the_heat_with_a_really/). So basically every month you'll get a cool special icon included as part of Ultra. I worked with some other really talented designers to build some other really cool icons (some with pixel art!) so that these icons look really cool. I want this feature to be awesome.

### iPad update?!

Notifications took a ton of work. But I'm really glad it's behind me because now I can focus on the iPad update. I'm going to be working on 1.4 and 1.5 in tandem with the iPad update so I'm not just going to disappear for awhile, but I'm really stoked to be able to now have a bunch of time to put into the iPad side of things and making the experience for Apollo and Reddit on the iPad spectacular, I have some really cool ideas. :)

### I don't see the 1.3 update in my App Store yet!

It can take up to a few hours sometimes for the update to hit every App Store, so just give it a bit! Sometimes it can also help if you search for the app and go right to its page and hit the ""Update"" button from there rather than the Updates tab.

### I have other questions!

I'll hang around all day here and I'm happy to answer.

All in all I really hope you all like this update, I seriously worked really hard on it, and above that, despite it having subscriptions I really tried to do it in a way that seemed very reasonable by talking to the community about it. Thanks so much for the support for Apollo always, the party's just getting started and I can't wait to show you what's in the pipeline.

iphone,"Apollo 1.3 is now available! I added notifications (finally), details inside.","It's been almost exactly a year since I first posted here about Apollo, a little new Reddit app for iOS on the block, and you all really received it with open arms. Thanks for an absolutely amazing last year.

Today comes Apollo 1.3, the notifications update! It includes (you guessed it!) notifications as the core part of the update, which has probably been the most requested feature for Apollo. It took a long time to get right, but I'm super stoked with how it came out. They're fast, super battery efficient, and almost like a mini-app in themselves, as you can reply, upvote, downvote, view context, and more right from the notification, so you don't even have to open the app most of the time, you can do everything right from the notification in your lockscreen or when it drops down from the top. You can even customize the sound with a bunch of great options, like a turkey gobble or a penguin… scree? (There's normal noises too.)

One part to mention early is that the update includes the dreaded, hated, loathed subscriptions. But if you're not interested in notifications you can completely ignore them. Long story short, push notifications require a server (it's where they're ""pushed"" from), and servers have ongoing monthly costs. I really couldn't afford just to give it away with Pro, and I didn't want to move Pro to a subscription model, so I added an extra feature pack called ""Apollo Ultra"" that you can choose, that comes with some notifications and some extra things!

Now I'll copy-paste a little FAQ I made up that explains more, but I'm happy to answer further questions too if you have any! I'll chill in this thread.

### Apollo 1.3

Notifications have been notably absent from Apollo from the get-go, but it's been because they're a really hard thing to do, and to do right. Long story short, there's a few ways to do them. You can do it completely on device, but this affects device battery life, and causes substantial delays in delivery as it can only fetch so often. An option that fixes these downsides is to do all the work on an external server, which doesn't affect battery life, and results in instant delivery. [Here's a video of Scott Forstall talking about server advantages way back in iPhone OS 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fMDdmcsaU)

On top of all this, recent versions of iOS really also souped up the power of what notifications can do on the device, but weirdly a lot of apps don't take advantage of that (look at iMessage for an app that does, how you can view your messages and reply inline).

For Apollo, I really didn't want to cut corners, so I've spent the last few months building up a really awesome solution with a dedicated server to handle the notifications, as well as taking advantage of everything iOS has to offer for making notifications powerful. The result is Apollo notifications are super battery efficient, super fast, and crazy powerful. You can view an entire conversation's context from the notification, reply, upvote, downvote, and more without ever having to leave the lockscreen. You can even customize the sound of the notification, I like making it sound like a turkey gobble. It's like a mini-app in itself.

Now, to be completely up front with you, servers have ongoing, monthly costs. Yeah, there's no getting around that unfortunately. I'd love to just say ""here, everyone who has Pro gets notifications!"" but where I made Pro a small, one-time fee, the notifications server and its ongoing costs mean that I'd eventually be in the red on that exchange, and keeping Apollo sustainable and healthy for the future is obviously a massive priority of mine. I want to keep the lights on.

On the flipside, I 100% know, understand and agree with [how most feel about subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8hk2tr/app_subscriptions_suck/). They're abused more and more lately, and they're expensive. So [I talked it over with the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/8k6mkl/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and/) and I wanted to come up with a reasonable solution to help pay for ongoing server costs, without gouging customers and infuriating them with something crappy.

I knew I couldn't compete with Netflix and whatnot and add another $10/month subscription to users, but as said servers have ongoing costs to me, so I elected to offer an option in the app to pay a meager 99 cents a month and you can have full access to notifications. I really hope you guys can find this reasonable and know I put a ton of work and talk into this update to make it as reasonable as I possibly could. I've worked really hard over the last year to work with the community on Apollo, so please understand that I honestly do really care about the community, and I hope my actions over the last year speak to that even more than my words.

### Show me a video of the features!

Okay! https://vimeo.com/297431875

### So how do I get notifications?

Notifications are bundled into a new pack called ""Apollo Ultra"". Hold up! Why not just call it ""Apollo Notifications""? Well, I did that at first, but it [didn't go so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/). Essentially Apple has a rule (3.2.2 subsection ii) that apps can't charge directly for system capabilities like push notifications. Apple very nicely called me and explained that they know there's associated costs with push notifications and the server required for them, but to prevent potential abuse this is a rule they have. They suggested to bundle it in with other features that aren't system capabilities (eg don't bundle it in with AirPlay streaming), and after [talking with the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/) we came up with some simple cool features to add to it that aren't massive deals if you don't have: App Theming (changing the colors of the app around), and some more custom app icons. So the end result is Apollo Ultra is a pack that has notifications, App Theming, and a new custom icon every month.

### What does it notify me of?

It notifies you of everything in your Reddit inbox: post replies, comment replies, username mentions, and private messages.

### Walk me through your process of building this update.

I started with a [thread in the ApolloApp subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/8k6mkl/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and/) talking about my plans and to see if it made sense. People seemed to understand the costs and like my concept, so I started building. Then [I got some feedback on the UI](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/91d5pr/notifications_does_this_ui_make_sense_to_yall/) to make sure it was clear and understandable. Fast forward a bit, it had been tested by the community and everyone seemed to like it, so I submitted it to Apple, and [it was unfortunately rejected](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/) (but Apple was cool). People gave some suggestions and ideas. I talked with the community and [laid out my plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9muoml/hey_ill_be_less_available_for_the_next_7_days/). I talked to Apple on the phone [and they were super cool and basically agreed with the plans so I updated the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9ontns/update_on_apollo_13_and_plans_for_it/) and got to work. I then submitted it, and Apple approved it! And here we are.

### Apollo Pro?

I want to be really, really, really clear that Apollo Pro is not going anywhere, not only that, but it's still the main part of Apollo, and will continue to be indefinitely. Zero plans to change that. So many of you supported Apollo right out of the gates, and the last thing I want to do is give the middle finger to a group of people I owe a ton to. Apollo Ultra is an optional, separate pack that you can get if you want, or ignore if you want. But I have zero plans to move the core of Apollo to a subscription model. The one-time fee model works great, and everyone seems to love it. I don't have any plans to be locking a bunch of extra features into Ultra, and on the flipside I have some really awesome extra features planned for Pro.

### Thank You

Just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who has supported Apollo and allowed this to be my full time job, I'm having a hoot building Apollo and have so much planned for its future, I can't wait to show you, and thanks for making all that possible.
