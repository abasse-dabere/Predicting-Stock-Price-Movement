apple,"15"" Touch Bar MBP detailed impressions, battery statistics","A few days ago I got my [CTO, 15” MacBook Pro (2.6 GHz, 512 GB, RP 460)](http://i.imgur.com/RgTSPbS.jpg) that I ordered right after the October Keynote. I ended up returning it because of a defect, and I won’t be reordering it (spoiler, more on that below), but I have a lot of impressions that I want to share. Hopefully they could be of help to anyone still on the fence about it.

#**Industrial Design, Fit, and Finish**

I’m going to be going into this in obnoxious detail, comparing it to my 2012 Retina (which is largely if not completely the same exterior design as the 2015 model). I figure that if you’re even considering this laptop, a part of you may care about its design more than most, and you might be considering the 2015 model.

The slimmer, smaller footprint and lighter weight are the first things I noticed, and are improvements that I greatly appreciated. On paper, the changes to footprint and weight appear insignificant: not even a full centimeter in either width or depth, and just half a pound lighter. But in person and in use, there’s this real sense of compactness that, when going back to the older model, you miss pretty quickly. I was initially dismissive about the half-pound weight savings, but the moment I picked it up out of the box I was impressed. I’ve seen a lot of questions here over whether the 15” is compact enough to be a suitable replacement for the outgoing 13” Pro or Air. I don’t believe so; there’s no confusing this footprint for one from any of the 13” laptops in Apple’s line-ups, not even the original unibody 13”. But it definitely comes close to a lot of 14” ultrabooks on the market.

Changes to thickness ended up being a tad more complex than I expected. Don’t get me wrong; it’s thin. It’s very thin. But when placed side-by-side with the outgoing design, I was surprised at how close they felt in thickness, [especially when the laptops were open and I was comparing base to base](http://i.imgur.com/MNCzROd.jpg). A reduction of 0.1” is nothing to scoff at, but I didn’t feel all that impressed. As I looked more carefully, I found several factors that might explain this. The more obvious reason is that thinness is an increasingly diminishing return, a problem that is compounded by the width and depth of 15” laptops. Thickness differences are much more perceptible among 13” machines or smaller. A more subtle source for the minimized impact stems from the display gasket and the rubber feet. These two elements have undergone the most drastic changes in thickness, as [you can see in this picture](http://i.imgur.com/m5hDd3i.jpg). From my rough measurements, I found that the display gasket is half as thick as the previous model, and the rubber feet to be double in thickness. I believe that the rubber feet have been made taller to make the laptop as easy to lift off a table or desk as before, but that’s just my guess.


The aforementioned thinner display gasket contributes significantly to the sensation of a more solidly-built laptop when closed. I felt like the tolerances on this new model are simply tighter all-around. The bottom plate meets the top case at a near seamless junction all around the laptop. Different materials are joined so perfectly that they seem to be hewn from one piece. The gaps between keyboard keys and the top case are unbelievably close. I always expect exceptional construction, fit, and finish from Apple, and this laptop excels in these fronts. If I had to complain about something, I feel like the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports could use more [deburring and finishing](http://i.imgur.com/RSDvgQc.jpg). The edges appeared much sharper and more jagged on mine than on my old machine.


The exterior is largely unchanged. The lids and bases have similar tapers that are amazing at masking thickness. I continue to like the way that light plays with the curvature of the lid. Speaking of lids and lights, I’m a big fan of the removal of the glowing logo. I hate branding, especially when it glows, and in my ideal world the logo would just be printed on like the regulatory text on the bottom. But I like the current solution. The new logo is slightly smaller, and the metal gives it a really premium feel. 


The hinge back is, in my opinion, the most significant change to the exterior. I never minded the black plastic that used to cover this area, but the new metal hinge helps make the entire exterior feel much more complete, which is a huge feat for such a refined design. I really like how thin the seam is between the hinge and body here, and the neat little intersection the bottom corners make with the seam of the bottom panel and the vent opening. There’s one omitted detail here that I would like for Apple to reattempt. If you look carefully at MacBooks with the black hinge, the actual seam where plastic meets the aluminum of the lid is really thin and virtually impossible to see at a distance. However, there’s a ridge that’s about a millimeter wide by the lid that’s molded into the plastic. I believe that this ridge is meant to match the width of the display gasket, keeping the line the gasket creates unbroken around the entire laptop. Because the hinge is now aluminum, the absence of this detail is much more pronounced. Creating a similar detail may diminish the impression of solidity between hinge and lid, but I think that it could benefit the design to create a small, 0.2 mm deep indent across the hinge to keep this line unbroken. Perhaps this is a bad idea because could lead to cracking, since the hinge itself is pretty thin.


Anyway, when opening the laptop, the hinge feels much lighter than before. I always felt that the hinge on the older Pro was a tad too tight. While the lid could be lifted with one finger with ease, the whole machine would slide back on certain surfaces. This is no longer an issue. Opening the hinge even more effortless than before. The hinge feels solid and holds its position well. It does not dampen small oscillations as well as the older hinge, but that certainly isn’t an issue.


looking inside, the hinge design seems largely similar to the MacBook, with a few notable differences. While the MacBook seems to route its display ribbon cable under the hinge, the Pro routes its two ribbon cables over the top, wrapping them tightly over the black section of the hinge. The cables match the finish of this portion of the hinge well, and the seams flanking them are small enough to mask their presence. There is no visible ventilation grille in this area. I’m sort of sad about this. The ventilation grille on the outgoing design was one of my favorite details (and probably no one else’s). Looking at those grilles felt like I was seeing something I shouldn’t be seeing, something that betrays the clean look everywhere else. But the vent area was always finished with the same quality as the rest of the exterior pieces, and was seamlessly machined into the top case.


Vents like the old grille sort of live on elsewhere on the laptop. The intakes along the left and right sides are wider and longer than on the previous generation. Gone are the two visible buttresses that broke up the vent into three sections. It’s now one long unbroken strip. I never liked these vents on the older design, but now that the buttresses are removed, I actually find these vents to be integrated into the design better than before. While the seam of the bottom plate used to be routed around this detail, the seam now simply becomes the side vent, as cutouts in both the bottom plate and top case contribute evenly to the vent opening. Looking into the vent, there’s a recessed vent grille that’s similar to the one on the old model, but with many more segments. This vent is very functional, as the lower portion is the aperture for the woofer, and the upper portion the fan intake. The slight draft around this opening feels stronger than on the last model’s, suggesting that they’re doing a better job taking in air. This is likely the result of both a larger opening and a more direct path to the fan than before.


Significantly thinner bezels frame the display. The left and right bezels are impressively thin. They may not match those of Dell’s Infinity Displays, but they still look stunning, and are quite the feat considering how aggressively the edges are tapered. I measured the left and right bezels at 9 mm wide, including the gasket and metal surround, which is about 5 mm thinner than before. It also seems the the Bezier curve that rounds the corners of the display, and therefore the entire laptop, are smaller to correspond to these new bezel sizes. They still appear bounded by each edge of the top two corners of the screen. I happily welcome this design change; tighter corners match the the more compact dimensions as a whole.


Even though the lower bezel has been shrunk as well, the lower portion of the screen now has a lot more area, thanks to the smaller, more recessed hinge. Apple decided to use this space for, ugh, branding. The move to San Francisco from Myriad for product labels makes it feel a bit austere. It matches the gray well, but I’m not so sure about the shift in general. I can’t say that I’m a fan of San Francisco outside of the digital realm. At least it’s neither reflective nor glowing, so I guess I can’t complain too much. It’s not all bad here. The material of this lower portion is matte, and I like having a different material line the lower portion, because it breaks up its visual mass (the recent Yoga 910 demonstrates how this could go wrong). I’m not entirely sure about this, but I think this matte material might actually be glass. It’s cool to the touch, has a texture eerily close to that of the trackpad, and has a top edge that is reminiscent of cut glass. That’s just a guess.


The speaker grilles that frame keyboard are much wider and much closer to being centered. I didn’t like the grilles on the 2012-2015 models for being so narrow and off-centered. Now they don’t look like afterthoughts. The scalloping around the keyboard is smaller and and narrower to correspond to the lower height of the keys, and it looks nice.


Overall, I am blown away by the design and the quality of the construction. This new MacBook Pro feels more premium than ever by a huge margin, and I think the design will stay fresh for the next four years.


#**Ports**


I didn’t buy too many USB-C accessories and didn’t have them around to test. And I ended up cancelling my hub and cable orders on Amazon (more on that later). As a result, I can’t say too much on \#donglelife from experience, so I’m just going to preach about how I feel about the situation for a bit.


I have always had at least two dongles for my 2012 Retina display: Thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet and a USB 2.0 hub. Two USB ports may be enough for most people, but it never cut it for me, as I have a mechanical keyboard, a mouse, wireless headphones that have a dongle, an external hard drive, and a phone or tablet occasionally connected to my laptop. Since USB 3.0 was a relatively new protocol at the time, a USB 3.0 hub was both hard to find and expensive. So when I was shopping around for USB-C adapters, the whole process felt somewhat familiar to me. 


Of course, when considering a Power Delivery dock or hub, the stakes are much higher; 87 watts higher. I have been really disappointed by the availability and documentation for Power Delivery hubs. The whole thing is an absolute mess and I won’t get into the USB PD specs, because most of these third-party manufacturers won’t either. I own a Nexus 6P, so I’m accustomed to the hazards of buying third-party USB-C charging accessories for a while now, but because of the different wattage, I’m now facing the growing pains of the new port all over again.


It’s one more thing that makes me lament the loss of MagSafe. Sure, I’m glad that we can now charge from any port on both sides, and sure, I’m glad that we can just replace the cable alone on the power adapter. But I think charging a computer, especially one that requires 80W+ is a very critical task, one that merits having its own, dedicated port. Since I couldn’t rely on any of the Power Delivery products, and wasn’t even sure if Apple’s own multiport adapter was up to the 87W task, I was planning on playing it safe just using the supplied adapter only. While Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are capable of doing an assortment of things, a port that’s plugged into that power adapter is just doing one thing: charging.


And I think that’s really the most compelling argument against the current port situation. Replacing ports that do one thing with ports that do five or six things sounds great and looks great on a keynote slide. But in practice, each port is often restricted to doing just one thing most of the time; whether it’s charging your computer, transferring data to and from your slim external drive, reading your SD cards, or charging your phone. And yes, it can be argued that you can get monitors that have charging and daisy-chaining right now, but I highly doubt that you will get those features from any of the devices I listed.

So why does that matter so much? Because if we treat each port as one thing at one time, just like the ports of old, the old MacBook Pro had seven ports (MagSafe, two USB 3.0, two Thunderbolt/MDP, HDMI, SD). And now we’re down to four. A USB hub used to be something you potentially needed, and now seems to be a requirement, especially when USB-C takes off. Perhaps this will be solved in the future with Kaby Lake’s native Thunderbolt 3 support. The current Pro 15” is already using two Alpine Ridge controllers, and any more ports on Skylake would require a third chip, if that’s even possible (is there even another PCIe 3.0x4 to utilize?). The wattages and price on those really start to add up.


Without digressing too much, I’m not too happy with Apple’s own USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. They make a multiport adapter with only one USB-A port that’s still rather expensive even after the price cut. Their C male to A female adapters are relatively clunky compared to what third parties have managed. Getting a complete second power adapter with cable and extension cord is now expensive as all hell. Even the LG 4K display only supplies 60W and not the 80+ that would be more suitable for this 15” Pro. It’s a recent trend of Apple to really skimp on its own accessories, and I’m not liking it. There are still no Airpods with the new iPhone 7. Some of the dongle backlash could have been mitigated by including both A to Lightning and C to Lightning cables with the new iPhone and iPad Pros, which I think is fair, considering the USB-C MacBook has been around for well-over a year. I think public perception about Thunderbolt 3 could be much more favorable if Apple presented a great and unique application for its throughput. Look at what Razer is doing with its Core. I'm not suggesting that Apple do the exact same, but it's something to consider.


I’m not done with mourning MagSafe. It’s the death of another nifty thing that made MacBooks a little more thoughtful than everyone else. Just when computers became dramatically more portable, they nixed the battery indicator. Just when computers were getting whisper quiet, they took away the awesome invisible sleep light. And now, just when Microsoft makes an annoyingly good implementation of a magnetic charger, we lose MagSafe. The chargers on the Surfaces are the best magnetic charger implementations I have ever seen: they’re thin, the plugs are light so the computer just grabs the charger from a larger distance, and the protruding element better prevents them from disconnecting from slight bumps, without interfering with the main feature. It’s also just a pain to aim and plug in stuff to such a small port without being able to angle the port towards me, like I can on a phone.


In my limited use of the ports, I found the connectors’ grip to be really strong, much tighter than that of my Nexus 6P. There’s a satisfying click. Removing things without pulling on the cable is kind of a challenge, and I found the best way to do it is to wiggle the plug out. I don’t agree with the decision to put the headphone jack behind the right side ports. [As you can see, they’re slightly too close](http://i.imgur.com/Nhk62pc.jpg), especially when you have an angled connector on your headphones. You don’t need to put the power connector in on the upper port, it’s just a habit, but if you anticipate being port constrained in the future, it’s something to keep in mind. At least it isn’t on the upper right of the the display like on some other laptops.


If you own a Nexus 6P or 5X, you’re in luck, because I could rapid charge my 6P from the MacBook Pro with the Huawei-supplied cable. This is probably the case for the Pixel as well. Surprisingly, I couldn’t get rapid charging from the 87W power adapter.


Also tried plugging in my old computer to the new Pro using my Nexus’ USB A male to C male cable, and [got this message](http://i.imgur.com/kIoigh5.jpg) on my old Pro. I’m not sure why it's only recognizing this cable as a Thunderbolt accessory.


#**Keyboard, Trackpad, and Touch Bar**


I was so ready to hate the new keyboard. I used to use ThinkPads, currently I use an MX Blue mech. I am a member of the Church of Key Travel; I pray to the IBM Buckling Spring every day for forgiveness for my rubber-dome sins. And I always felt like the keyboard on my 2012 Pro, while decent, was a bit of a compromise. So when I read that the new keyboard had a key travel of just 0.5 mm, I was irate. But I ended up loving the new keyboard so very much. If reducing the key travel is what it takes to make keys this tactile and stable, then I am all for it. It amazes me how crisply and evenly the keys depress. There’s virtually no wobble, no play besides up and down. The keys are satiny and nicely scalloped. The increased size not only looks better, but feels better for more distant keys, such as delete. The sound is my favorite part. They can be loud if you slap the keys down, but typing normally, there’s a lovely “tunk” sound that isn’t too loud. I didn’t need to dramatically change my typing style to adjust; I just needed to be lighter with my keystrokes and I was set.

If I had to nitpick, again, I’m not a fan of San Francisco replacing VAG Rounded for the legend font. VAG Rounded might be too dated, but San Francisco just feels strange here. Perhaps San Francisco with a bit of tweaking could address both of my concerns over legends and labels. There’s also too much variance in the weight of the symbols, and on the whole, the symbols don’t appear to be getting sufficient backlighting. I’m not sure why control, option, and command are now justified towards the spacebar, considering fn is still left-justified. But that’s about all the negatives I have regarding the keyboard. The keyboard on my old Pro feels and sounds squishy and squeaky.

The trackpad is a different story. I was so excited by the size of the new trackpad, but in practice, I don’t really understand why it needed to be so big. I really like how close it is to the keyboard, because it’s now much easier to make minor cursor movements with your thumb without removing a hand from the keyboard. But I do not appreciate the width. While I haven’t had any issues with palm rejection, my right palm was always resting nearly entirely on the trackpad. It just doesn’t feel right. Additionally, the trackpad glass feels much smoother than the trackpad on the 2012 Pro, and occasionally my clammy hands had trouble gliding over the surface. Multi-touch gestures felt less responsive, and it often mixed up four-finger swipes for pinching.

This is the first time I used a Force Touch trackpad extensively. I loved the click. It felt more real than my older model’s actual physical click, which doesn’t make a lick of sense, but it’s the truth. While I would like the click to be a little firmer than the firmest setting, I still really enjoyed the feedback. I was also surprised at how even the feedback was across the entire surface. I often found myself Force Touching challenging words such as “the” and “or” just to feel the feedback. The sound has to be mechanical. It just sounds too much like a glass or ceramic tile actually tapping into something. But Force Touch wasn’t perfect. Occasionally, especially near the edges of the trackpad, the trackpad would miss my click, probably a result of aggressive palm rejection. It would also do this when it didn’t register that I’ve completely lifted my finger following a previous click. Missing a click is catastrophic because it suddenly breaks the illusion, and left me feeling bad about pushing so hard, even though I shouldn’t.

Right off the bat, I’m going to start off my discussion about the Touch Bar by saying that, in it's current state, I loathed it. I can’t sugarcoat it. I had a lot of issues with it.

I didn’t expect the hardware to be so problematic. The outer glass covering the bar has a slight satin finish, that, while not quite matte, does a good job of preventing glare. However, there is a considerable air gap between the cover glass and the display. Because of this, the display itself ends up [very prone to glare and reflections](http://i.imgur.com/RSDvgQc.jpg), negating the efforts of the cover glass. I didn’t find the display too dim when I avoided light sources directly above. But when there were light sources above the laptop, it became much harder to see the display without peering over to look. I haven’t seen complaints about this in other reviews, so I may be too demanding, but this really bothered me. I also didn’t find the display itself to be of the highest quality. It’s high density and has that amazing OLED contrast, but for some reason, I kept seeing weird color distortion around the fringes of every icon, like some sort of chromatic aberration. Again, I could just be too demanding, because I haven’t seen anyone else say this. The sapphire crystal on the TouchID button doesn’t match the reflectance of the rest of the bar, which is fine, but what I was less okay with was just how rattly the button was. Resting my finger on it was nowhere near as pleasant as the solidly constructed home buttons on the iPad Pro or iPhones before the 7.

I get that touch surfaces need to be horizontal. I really believe that. However, the Touch Bar demonstrated to me how display surfaces need to be upright. Interacting with the Touch Bar inherently wasn’t as natural as a keyboard key, since I’d have to position my hand in a way so that it wouldn’t obstruct my view of the bar. Most of the time, this meant flattening my hand and reaching with the very tip of my middle finger. Using my pointer finger meant curling in my other fingers, which obstructed my view of half the bar. It’s probably not as bad as I’m making it sound, but every once in awhile I caught myself leaning over or pulling my hand away to see the full state of the bar. Even if you memorize the layouts, which I was starting to do for a lot of applications, pressing on the Touch Bar without looking down is mildly unpleasant due to the lack of haptic feedback. It’s a lot like getting to the bottom of a staircase and expecting another step.

But what ultimately ended up hurting the Touch Bar experience for me the most was inconsistency and bugs. Although the bar is quite responsive, this is probably the buggiest Apple product I have ever used. I [could](https://gfycat.com/EasygoingCoordinatedAustralianfreshwatercrocodile) go [on](http://i.imgur.com/Tn2sa0T.jpg) and [on](http://i.imgur.com/aAmAm2b.jpg) about [all](https://gfycat.com/FreeOrganicIbis) the [bugs](https://gfycat.com/AppropriateNegligibleBilby) that I had, but I think this is something that is better shown than told. Half the time, I had no idea what a scrubber would be for; clicking the icon wouldn't take me to the source, and pulling it around did nothing. It was weird opening up File Info in Finder with the bar, and then having to reach over the keyboard to close it with the trackpad. TouchID also suffered problems with consistency. I still am not 100% sure what gets to use TouchID and what doesn’t. It often wasn’t an option when the system needed a password. I don’t understand why a password is necessary on boot when other computers can be powered on by the correct fingerprint. It’s baffling.

I can’t say that it was all bad, though. Many of the features I found laughably useless, like the slow typing suggestions. But some of the uses and features of the bar I found pretty neat. I especially like the bar’s behavior for modal windows. Per-app customization is a nice touch, and I liked having copy-to and move-to buttons for Finder. Tab previews in Safari were pretty useless, since the preview windows are just too small to distinguish each page, but buttons for favorites were nice. I took away the Siri icon and replaced it with sleep and lock buttons, which were incredibly useful. I also ended up liking the sliders for brightness and volume in the compact controls menu. Scrub bars for video playback is a great feature. Also, it’s nice to have an option to display function keys on a per-app basis. This ended up being necessary for me, since I was having trouble with hitting the chevron to expand the control strip, so I rebound fn to expanding the control strip instead. I also had no problem with the lack of physical Esc, as I rebound it to Caps Lock.

In its current form, the Touch Bar just isn’t compelling. Had it been the same price to get a function key version of the 15” Pro, I would have done so. I wouldn’t say that the bar is a dealbreaker by any means, but it is certainly not a reason to get this laptop. Apple is a company that demands a justification for everything that makes it onto their laptops: a charging light only makes sense when a charger is connected, so it should be on the charger; a sleep light is only useful when on, so it should disappear into the aluminum when off. So why am I having such a hard time finding a justification for the Touch Bar's existence? The developer guidelines even tout how there's no API for determining whether or not a device has a Touch Bar. Even the guidelines are indifferent towards its existence.

Usually when Apple introduces something new to the Pros, it’s something that ends up being essential within two years. The entire industry has followed them on the push for HiDPI displays, but I really doubt that the industry will ever mimic the Touch Bar. I’d like to be proven wrong. I’d like for this post to be referenced years from now when every computer has a Touch Bar so that people could look back and laugh at this fucking idiot for not seeing its potential.


#**Performance**

I didn’t get a chance to move my more demanding programs over. I also didn’t get to Bootcamp and try some games, since Bootcamp is still blowing out speakers (which, by the way, sound incredible). So I don’t have much to say on this front, unfortunately. I guess the thing that I could appreciate was just how fast the SSD was. The SSD on my 2012 model is no slouch, but there's just something strange about watching 100+ MB files move around like they're nothing.

On a general note, I think the biggest point of controversy in terms of specs would be the Radeon Pro line. Personally, I'm pretty happy with the 460. It's amazing for a 35W profile, and there's never been a Pro with a card over 45W. I'm not really itching for a 75W+ card like the 1060 in a laptop this thin. I doubt that the limitation was price as much as it was thermal performance and wattage. That's not to say that the 1060 isn't impressive, and that machines that have it, such as the Razer Blade, aren't impressive. But most of the laptops I had been looking at have Quadro M500M to Quadro M2000M in this range, and I find the 460 to be a little faster and more efficient than all of those offerings.

However, I'm not sure why three graphics options are necessary. Driving two 5K displays is such a niche feature, that I don't see why the base model needs the 450. The 450 and 455 feel redundant. I'd rather see just two options: one with the Iris Pro 580, and one with the 580 and the Radeon Pro 460. The latter could still be a $200 option. I know Skylake SKUs with GT4e graphics are pricier, but they probably aren't more pricier than an entire dGPU.


#**Battery and Display**


I can say a lot about the battery, though. I don’t want to spend too much time cleaning this up, so here are some tests and results of mine. These were performed after I was sure Spotlight had finished indexing. I also performed SMC and PRAM resets. I monitored drain and capacity with coconutBattery, GPU status with gfxCardStatus, and fans with SMC Fan Control.

**First test**

Usage: About 8-12 moderate to heavy Safari Tabs, cycled so that they aren't suspended. Spotify with occasional dGPU acceleration. Dynamic switching enabled. Brightness at 75%.

Data: Consumption at 14-20W range. CPU temp at 39C. The dGPU was rarely summoned, and even when utilized, the fans never spooled up above 2160 L/2000 R RPM the entire time. The dGPU kicked in when I refreshed a page, changed a Space, and opend Launchpad in rapid succession. Temperatures remained low. When the dGPU activated, battery temperatures only climbed by 1C.

My 2012 model would pull 21-30W under these conditions, set to the same scaling setting, with the CPU temp at 45C.

*Runtime: 7 hours and 10 minutes*

**Second and third tests**

Usage: Spotify closed. 8-12 tabs still cycled just as before. iGPU forced using gfxCardStatus, and monitored in case of any dependencies. Brightness still at 75%.

Data: Consumption at 12-16W. CPU probe at 33C. Temperatures were overall similar to dynamic switching. There were no noticeable hangups during animations, video playback, etc.
The 2012 model with the same controls draws 16-25W at 37C from the CPU probe.

*Runtime 1: 8 hours and 19 minutes*

*Runtime 2: 7 hours and 45 minutes*

**Fourth test**

dGPU forced by gfxCardStatus. Same load as the first test. 75% brightness again.

Data: Consumption up to around 16-26W, but usually on the lower end of that range most of the time. Forgot to take temperature reading, but fan still never went above 2140 L/2000 R RPM, just like with iGPU only, and it didn't feel significantly hotter.

*Runtime: 5 hours and 48 minutes.*

Even though the dGPU rarely kicks in for day to day stuff, the Radeon Pro 460 seems really efficient for small tasks. 5:48 is nothing to scoff at for dGPU only, and it runs very cool and quiet. My results don't seem too far off from ArsTechnica's, which was 7 and 1/2 hours dGPU only and 15 and 1/2 hours iGPU only at around 40% brightness.

However, the larger issue with this new MBP really is the battery capacity. It's a bit of a challenge to squeeze out a lot of time to begin with. I did manage to get a projected 10:51 at 50% brightness and iGPU only, again basing that on drain and stopwatch and not the inaccurate macOS estimate (the macOS estimate was actually always a little lower, except for this test where it was saying 13 hours). So Apple's 10 hour estimate is very possible, as well as Ars' 15 hour figure. Although, at 50% brightness, the display [isn't noticeably brighter](http://i.imgur.com/biv21Z8.jpg) than the outgoing model's (even ignoring the weird color cast I had on the new display), not even by one 10% increment. It's only at the [last three increments](http://i.imgur.com/6IX6AZk.jpg) where the display seems much brighter.

I probably should have kept it a little longer to do more tests. Overall, I'm impressed with the efficiency of the dGPU, but I'd probably be more impressed with Skylake if the battery in these new Pros were still 99.5Wh or close to that. Regardless, I still think these numbers are quite impressive, even against the competition.

#**Concluding Remarks**

Ultimately, I had to send my laptop back over one defect. That’s why a lot of this review is in past tense (and also because I can’t control my tenses). The right fan would rattle [on boot](https://clyp.it/jurg25s2) and wake, and intermittently on idle. I wasn’t keen on my new machine sounding like it had a platter drive, so I took it to the Genius Bar. My Genius didn’t seem all that concerned with the issue, seeing as how he was dealing with two other cases at the same time. So after an hour of software diagnosis after software diagnosis, I realized this was going nowhere. Perhaps I’m too close to actually being insane to enjoy being gaslit for that amount of time. So I decided to spare the second trip and return the laptop right there.

It’s an unfortunate, disappointing end to a month of anticipation. On the whole, I really liked the laptop. I felt like it was quite the upgrade from before, and any complaint that I might have raised in the past 5000 words is minor in the grand scheme of things. I didn’t even mind the price. The thing that I ended up minding the most is the current 3-4 week wait time. I figure that if if can wait another month, I would have already waited two, and I’m already that much closer to a potential refresh. I’m also keeping my eye open for laptops at CES. Had there been no defect or wait, I’d be happily typing away on my new Pro. There isn't a laptop I'd rather have.",73,291,2016-12-01,AAPL,0.05504267290234566,0.90297432243824,0.04198298277333379
apple,Anyone else disappointed by the decision to phase out the Airport series?,"As reported by [macrumors.com](http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airport-routers-ranked-highest-in-customer-satisfaction-as-apple-halts-further-development.2018671/), the Airport series has the highest customer satisfaction. But Tim Cook seems to be halting any further development of the devices.

Look, I get it -- the Airport has low volume, and probably much lower margins than other devices. Talent is limited and expensive, advertising is a limited resource, and if you have to choose whether to increase sales of high-margin, high-volume products like iPhones and iPads or the Airport series, it makes sense to choose the former.

Nevertheless, I'm really disappointed. One of the things I love about the Apple ecosystem is its seamlessness. I was actually considering upgrading my 2012 Airport Extreme Basestation to a more recent model once they updated the wifi.

Anyone think there's a chance that T.Cook reverses this decision?",222,289,2016-12-01,AAPL,0.08690208941698074,0.8599696159362793,0.053128235042095184

apple,Let's let Nvidia know that we want macOS drivers for their GPUs.,"Edit: A lot of people are hating on eGPU. Let me paint a picture for you.

*You own a 13"" MBP. It's thin, light, and has great battery life. But unfortunately, it only has intel Iris graphics; great for day-to-day tasks, but not very good for Final Cut or gaming. You walk in the door and plug a single cable into your laptop. Suddenly, your ultra-portable computer has more GPU compute power than the $10,000 mac pro. For $300-$800, your now have a workstation capable of playing brand new games at ultra settings/100fps and rendering Final Cut movies more than* ***twenty times faster*** *than your laptop could while unplugged*.  

_____


The price for external TB3 GPU enclosures is rapidly falling (from $500) and can soon be had for [$300](https://www.akitio.com/expansion/node). It is easy to see the price falling below the $200 mark in the next 12 months.


For the uninitiated, this means you can buy a TB3-capable computer (such as the new Macbook Pros, Razer Blade, etc.), and for less than $500 have the GPU capabilities of a full blown desktop PC! Thin and light laptop on the go, to full blown gaming, **VR**, and rendering powerhouse when plugged in at home.


I really see this as the ultimate modern compute platform, [and Razer has really been leading the way.](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-stealth#ultrabook-desktop)

The beauty of this is that all we need to make this a reality in the Mac world is **proper drivers from Nvidia for their GPUs.** 

Being a supply and demand world, **we need to let Nvidia know that there *is* demand for Thunderbolt3 eGPUs on the Mac.**


**Edit 2:** For all the comments saying ""hurr durr just buy a PC""

I *do* own a PC. I built my own gaming rig this year, overclocked CPU, liquid cooling, and all. The problem is, I *also* need a laptop that is lightweight and portable. So In addition to my gaming rig I own a macbook pro 13"" and a XPS 13. I much prefer the macbook and macOS.

Need to listen to music AND charge your phone? I've NEVER found myself in a position where I've had to do this and frankly, if you have then you're clearly a power user and should invest in some Bluetooth headphones or buy a phone with a headphone jack. Simples. 

What about in the car? Most cars these days have Bluetooth obviously but mine in fact does not. I used to plug my 6S from lightening into my cigarette lighter for power and from the headphone jack to my auxiliary input for audio. With my 7 I can't do that of course so I just plug it straight into my auxiliary input with the (shudder) dongle that I keep in my car and what I've discovered is that I don't actually need to connect the phone to power as the battery life is more than sufficient to last me a day and a half with my use anyway.

apple,Macbook Pro 2016 vs 2015 review. 2015 is not really faster and has inferior cooling.,"https://youtu.be/nGmCUK-x5-M

I think this is one of the more fair reviews out there that really does a pretty good job of explaining some of the benchmarks we've been seeing.  I'm glad to see the new Macbook actually has adequate cooling. The 2015 model, and really many models through the years leaned on intel's thermal throttling.  The new dual fan config and side intakes are a huge improvement. 50% fan at 100% load is exactly where laptops should be.  The old model would max its fans and have to slow down the CPU to keep running.

edit: Someone pointed out that Louis Rossman got 99C and thermal throttling. Maybe appleinsider's tests weren't as demanding. Disappointing.

apple,"So, it's been almost 3 months since the delivery of my Iphone 7, and I couldn't miss the headphone jack more.","I was one of those people who really objected to removing the headphone jack, as I use it daily, whenever I get out of the house. I knew it was not going to be a happy transition, but I didn't think it was going to be a disaster, but it was, at least for me. So, I'd like to provide a little counter narrative to what's been running on here, which is 'it was not a big deal after all, you guys are idiots for panicing'.
 
So, let's start from the beginning. I wanted the phone, so I decided to give the dongle a chance. People were saying how it would be inconvenient to not be able to charge and listen at the same time. I was skeptical as I don't quite recall myself doing so before, boy was I wrong. Almost immediately, I was thrown in the exact scenerio. I had to travel a few days after getting the phone, and well, the trip wasn't very fun. Normally, I would plug the phone into the AC jack and listen to music while I sleep on the plane. Then by the time I arrive it would be fully charged. Unfortunately, I had to choose. So, I decided I wanted music to drown out the ambient noise on the plane, and since I had 60%, it wasn't a big deal. Well, by the time I landed, I had 10% where I normally would be fully charged. You pretty much have to make a choice as to what's more important on your trip.

The same applies when I was walking around in the city I was visiting. Normally, if my phone is low, I throw it in my backpack and have it charge off the power bank while listening to music. Well, again I had to choose. You either charge or you get music. It's especially annoying when I had to look something up on youtube, and had to unplug the phone from charging and plug in the headphone. I have never had to unplug my phone in the middle of a charge as much as I have since getting the new phone.
 
Now, onto the dongle. I was skeptical but open to it. I'm an audiophile, so I use my Westones rather than the apple buds. I'm not new needing a DAC or using a dongle, so that wasn't that big a deal. However, Apple's solution was far worse than I could have imagined. It's not the fact that it's a dongle, it's how the dongle is built.
 
Since getting my phone, I'm on my third dongle. What I realized immediately after opening the box is, the dongle is really poorly built. The cable is as flimsy as the old Apple buds. As such, I didn't imagine they would last long.... and they didn't. A problem I've experienced is that if you put your phone with a dongle in your jeans pocket, there's a good chance your jeans will put pressure on the dongle and bend the fatter bit that comes out of the hard casing that is connected to the cable. Overtime, it will cause problems, and it had. Within two weeks, the first dongle started malfunctioning. Audio was only coming out of one channel, and I had to adjust the cable of the dongle to try to get the signal to correct itself. Basically there's no way of preventing this because the way the dongle is built, unless you have cargo pants with huge pockets. The only saving grace is that Apple made the replacement process pretty easy. Then, it happened again, and well again.
 
The last problem, and to me the biggest problem, is also the way the dongle is built, and how tight the connectors are. Basically, the problem is with what happens when you drop your phone. It used to be, when you drop your phone, the headphone unplugs from the phone, and all is good as long as you have a case. In fact, for me, it usually worked one of two ways, if it's a sudden and forceful drop, my headphone gets pulled out, in which case no harms done, or if it's dropping slowly, it will pull on my headphone cable, which will suspend it in the air. That's not really ideal, but usually it saves the phone from dropping, and the phone wasn't pulling at such a force that would damage the headphones anyway.
 
Now, in terms of the dongle, what's been happening is that the threshold for disconnecting has drastically increased. What that means is, your headphone is unlikely to disconnect from the dongle unless you're flinging the phone with force. The problem is, it allows the headphone to be pulled at a much higher tension than previously before it is allowed to disconnect. So, in reality, when I last dropped my phone, the force was so strong that it pulled my head down a bit, and the headphone didn't disconnect. What ended up happening was that it pulled the cable of my headphones to the point where I'm getting signal lost and having to push around the cable to try to get the sound to work, much like how the damaged dongle worked. Now, I admit, this has to do with user error in me dropping the phone. However, one has to admit that having the fail safe of cable disconnecting when too much force is excerted was incredibly nice. I'm glad my headphones have exchangeable cables, if they didn't I'd have a broken pair of $500 headphones. But regardless, it has be incredibly annoying.
 
So, all in all, I would just like to share my experience and say that things aren't all sunshine and rainbows. I understand the need to have all these topics praising Apple, but I think it's healthy to hear the other side as well.",245,375,2016-12-04,AAPL,0.11766085214912891,0.8378035128116608,0.04453561455011368

apple,Downloading your entire music library to iPhone–no easy task but there's a work-around.,"So, all in all I love Apple Music and I know we're in the streaming day and age but lately I've noticed I've almost gone over my monthly cellular data limit. After looking through the settings on my iPhone, I noticed that Apple Music is the culprit, burning through GBs like crazy. So I thought, no problem, I have plenty of space available on my iPhone 7 so I'll just download my entire music library–problem fixed! Except, as it turns out, that's no easy task.

While Apple makes it easy to download a playlist, album or song onto your iOS device with a single tap, there isn't an option to download your entire music library. And, when you connect your iPhone directly to iTunes on your Mac, it won't let you add your entire library unless you turn off iTunes Match.

THE FIX

If anyone else has run into this issue, the only way I found to accomplish this was to create a Smart Playlist on my Mac, including my entire music library.

apple,An In-Depth Beats Solo3 Review from an Audiophile (Beats by Dre? Beats by Apple.),"Apple is really doing it: they're taking a brand that has the dominant marketshare in the headphone marketplace despite having had subpar audio quality, and greatly improving it while adding groundbreaking features that will take the competition a year or two to catch up with. It's a bit of a genius proposition: purchase the most popular headphone brand that people buy solely for the branding and marketing despite abysmal audio quality, then rebrand it so that consumers are actually getting a quality product with innovative features. The Solo3 is a solid buy for most, even if its audio presentation isn't perfect.

Design

Appearance

The matte black Solo3 I'm auditioning is classy and understated. They're stylish without screaming ""Beats"" in a gaudy way like they did in the past. Unfortunately though, the two glossy options do cheapen the design. The rest of the options, particularly rose gold, are tastefully done.

Build quality

Despite being lightweight, the Solo3 manages to feel substantial. There is no flexing, and the headband seems reasonably reinforced. The earcups do rattle, but they also swivel for a better fit so it's a fair trade-off.

Comfort/fit 

Plush leather earpads make the Solo3 more comfortable than anticipated, while also being softer than expected making the Solo3 feel more like a cushion pressed against the ears. Very surprisingly they're the most comfortable pair of headphones I own, even more so than the huge ATH-700 with its velour pads. Perfect for glasses wearers as the earpads can be adjusted in a manner that's completely unaffected by frames. The headband is also soft and grippy enough that the Solo3 will stay in place no matter what. For the purpose of this review I can shake my head in any direction and the headband won't move, which makes it reassuring for use at the gym or for a run. They're a rare combination of being on-ear, comfortable, and fixed on the head.

My ears can tend to get red and burn a bit after having these on for a while, but the pain is mostly felt after the fact and I'm working on adjusting the fit to prevent this. On the plus side, I can wear these longer than my other headphones with less pain.

Isolation is excellent as well considering there is no active noise cancellation (I dislike ANC anyway as it can muck up the sound and waste battery life.) At around 60-70% volume the outside world can be mostly blocked out, at least enough so that speech is completely inaudible.

Bonus: even the driver (the part that emits sound) is padded better than I've ever seen, if you have extremely small ears then you're in for a treat. They really thought over the comfort design of these headphones.

Packaging

Premium Apple unboxing experience reminiscent of any other Apple product, with a bit more flair. The single complaint I have is that the included carrying case could be a tad more padded and premium.

Sound

Beats' Sound Signature

This is where the review gets a little less glowing, though bear with me. I'm an audiophile, I've studied to a greater extent than I'd care to admit what makes for good sound. These aren't the type of headphones where a listener is going to hear every little detail in a song, but that's okay for listeners who haven't owned a better pair of headphones before; for better or worse, the mass market may not notice the flaws in the Solo3's sound.

The sound signature is a colored Beats presentation with a massive low-end accentuation, forward mids, and a very laid-back treble. But you know what? Apple's Beats sound signature is exciting, fun, and sounds good with most modern music. Mids are nicely present, so voices and guitars will still be front-and-center alongside the bass. Some songs do sound off, and no amount of EQ is going to fix those that do. Nowhere else are you going to find such an accentuated bass with forward mids, but the faults are glaring:

Issues

The problem is the bass and and treble aren't accurate. Not even the bass is going to sound as it was intended to by the sound producer, and some drums have a bloated if not addictive-at-times sound that makes drum kits lose their detail. If you're going to be listening to music with mostly real instruments and no modern production, the Solo3 may not be the best option. However, the bass is mostly fine though it is accentuated and loses a bit of detail in the process. The low-end also bleeds into the mids a bit too much, which causes some details like a guitar in the background to potentially be lost.

What needs finer tuning is the treble. Cymbals that have a fine detail on a pair of better-tuned headphones can be reduced to sounding more like a hip-hop ""ticking"" sound. The treble is frankly abysmal. I don't mind it being so laid-back but good treble needs to retain its detail.

There is a positive to having such a lacking treble, and that is that there's less listening fatigue. Perhaps Beats was looking out for its customers who listen to these loudly, as the lack of higher frequencies make it possible to listen to these loudly longer.

Bottom-line

HEY, TIM, APPLE, DR. DRE, AND JIMMY IOVINE: THE SOLO SERIES COULD SOUND FANTASTIC IF YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RETAIN THE BEATS SOUND SIGNATURE (ACCENTUATED LOW-END) WHILE STILL HAVING A DETAILED BASS AND TREBLE. KEEP THE TREBLE LOWER THAN THE OTHER FREQUENCIES, BUT ACTUALLY MAKE CYMBALS SOUND LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

These aren't for analytical listening, but for enjoyment they work well with most songs and genres. While most songs aren't going to sound exactly as they were intended, I'd recommend auditioning these yourself to see if it suits your personal music taste if you do listen to modern music (pop, hip-hop, EDM) alongside a mix of other genres.

W1, baby

Wireless Connectivity

Works as well (better in my book since there's no cable noise... or wire) as using a wired headphone with an iPhone. Pairs instantly out-of-the-box. Pressing the button on the Solo3 while it's unpaired will connect it to a modern iPhone/iPad seamlessly within two seconds. 2012 Retina MacBook Pro is a bit more hit-and-miss as it can tend not to show up as an immediately connectable option, though I'll look into that. Rock-solid connection though. I can move to another room and experience no cutting out. I was also able to watch an episode of Halt and Catch Fire with no lag and perfectly in-sync audio.

Side note: The Solo3 are excellent for watching movies/TV; the soundstage is precise, and not too wide or closed-in, so it provides a great surround experience that brings background details to the surface as well or better than my open-back Audio Technica ATH-700. Meanwhile the accentuated bass brings a subwoofer-like excitement to movies while voices are crystal-clear.

Wireless Quality

Apple worked some DAC magic into the Solo3 as they sound as good or better than they do using a wired connection. Oddly enough, I do find an extra bit of clarity using them with an iPhone 6s Plus than I do using them with a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro; it seems they both use AAC to transmit to the Solo3 but the iPhone's Bluetooth is 4.2 vs 4.0. However's there no need for ever using them wired:

Battery Life

It lasts as long as advertised. 40+ hours of battery plus ultra-quick charging.


Conclusion

Apple has managed to create the first practical wireless headphone on the market, lasting long enough to only need to be charged under a handful of times a month while also having best-in-class wireless functionality. All in an understated lightweight design that's portable enough to go anywhere and comfortable enough to wear for long periods. They put it under the Beats branding, which means a fun sound that lacks clarity particularly in the high-end. However, the Solo3 is the first very good headphone from Beats (with the first two good headphones being the Solo2 and the Studio 2.0). This gives me hope for the future of where Apple will take Beats, as they're already proving their worth and the future of the brand by releasing a headphone with groundbreaking features.

If the Solo4 can greatly improve upon the detail of the sound quality while retaining Beats' signature fun sound, it could be an all-around winner. For now the Solo3 gets my recommendation for being a very practical daily driver wireless headphone. There aren't any other wireless headphones I'd recommend more as a daily driver, thanks mostly to the benefits of the W1 chip and portable design.



Audiophiles: 
The sound signature of the Solo3 is unique and pleasant despite lacking clarity in the bass and treble, though it isn't isn't an unlistenable experience like the old Beats by Dre. If you find value in the features of the Solo3, these could be a fun portable pair of headphones perfect for casual listening or the gym.

Would I have bought the Solo3 if they were wired headphones? No. But the trade-off of some clarity is worth it for what the Solo3 does bring to the table, and the fun sound isn't unpleasant. In fact, I'm growing to like it and would be completely satisfied if they figure out a way to improve clarity without losing the addictive sound signature in future iterations.",127,222,2016-12-05,AAPL,0.035963399335742,0.9042600989341736,0.059776511043310165

apple,Why isn't the AppleWatch series 2 getting more love? The thing is amazing.,"I owned the original AppleWatch and while I definitely optimized it for a few specific things I wanted to do, when people asked me if they should buy it, I would say no.  That it was just too slow to be useful and that the UI is half baked.  

I recently picked up a series II (what can I say, I'm a fanboy) and it is literally one of the biggest generational jumps I have seen in an Apple product ever.  I think if this is the watch they had released.  It's super fast and responsive.  I keep finding more and more that I can do with it.  Things like being able to quickly type out a text message with the ""Scribble"" function is nuts.

apple,Is it time for apple to ditch Lightning?,"So the headphone jack controversy is still a problem even with rumors that Samsung will ditch lightning. Companies like Samsung and Moto are using the USB Type C connector instead of the 3.5 jack. This makes a lot of sense as if you buy a pear of nice USB-C headphones, you can use them on other devices that use USB-C such as laptops and PCs. However Apple has really set themselves up for isolation with the proprietary lightning connector as only iOS devices currently use it. If you buy a nice pair of lightning headphones, you are stuck with using them on only on your phone. Is it time that Apple ditches the lightning connector? I know people will say that it just came out and that Apple needs more time with it. However I argue that it's lived it's life. The iPhone 1 through the 4S all used the 30 pin connector (5 models in total) and the iPhone 5 through 7 used lightning (5 models in total). I am aware that the 30 pin connector was around long before the iPhone, but with apple's latest push with USB-C with the new MBP, I think the next iPhone should ditch lightning in favor of USB-C.

2). Then I got to thinking... hmm, why not use sound to push the water out? I found the resonant frequency of the water in the grill to be around 165 Hz. Using the free app ""Sonic"" (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonic-v/id986999895?mt=8), I generated a tone that literally pushed the water out of the speaker.

apple,The iPhone 7 Plus is the first iPhone since the original one that I just can't put down.,"I just wanted to say that I'm blown away by the experience I have with my 7 Plus. I owned almost every iPhone since the original one. The last ones were 5s, 6, 6s, SE and now the 7 Plus. 

The original iPhone, when it came out, was special tho. I just couldn't put it down or let it sit on the table for more than a few minutes. It was such an all around awesome experience that i just had to have it all the time. I had to pick it up every few minutes even if I wasn't doing anything with it. Just swiping through 2 or 3 pages, scrolling a little, looking at the beautiful screen and enjoying the overall design. 

After the first iPhone all the others were meh. Don't get me wrong. My favorite iPhone was the 4. But I just never had that urge again to keep one in my hands all the time. 

That has changed with the 7 Plus. I upgraded 2 weeks ago and I can't keep my hands off of it. It is just such an overall immersive experience. First of all, I'd never thought I would get used to such a big screen in such short time. It's crazy, especially upgrading from an SE. After a few days I have to say I couldn't go back. The beautiful display and its sharpness and colors, the overall feel of the device itself, the beautiful design, the Taptic Engine, the smooth performance of ios10 and other software. Sure, the bigger screen makes browsing the internet, writing emails, playing games etc more convenient. Therefore you use it more automatically. But I catch myself picking it up all the time without really doing anything with it. I feel like holding a piece of future in my hand. Even though there are devices which look more modern oder futuristic it's the overall experience. 

Combine that with some beautiful W1 chipped Beats and you're all set. :)

apple,Seriously impressed with my nTB MBP 2016,"So, I debated whether I should get the 2015 MBP or the 2016. I ended up with the cheapest 13"" - 2.0ghz and 8gb ram - because I put my faith in Apple's ability to optimize hardware and software.

Boy, do they do that well. I edit videos for a living, and to make rushes on site, I needed something small but still capable of doing small edits. FCPx shows such impressive performance on this little laptop. I can edit Prores straight out of my camera in 4k and go to town. No need for proxies.

Another thing I just had to test was gaming performance. Now, I don't game a lot of heavy titles, but I do enjoy a game of League of Legends and Counter-Strike. When working on site and sleeping in hotels, they can be a good way to finish a long work day.

League of Legends runs great at 1650x1050 resolution. Menus and HUD seemed a bit funky on resolutions above this, but 1650x1050 still looks great.
At high settings, I ran around 70-100fps and never had performance problems playing a night of ARAMs.

Now, CS:GO - again at 1650x1050 resolution, this time everything on low. That's how I like my Counter-Strike. I was running around 100fps all game, and dropped to about 70-80 in a couple smokes.

This is on a paper thin 13"" laptop, running in Mac OS X - NOT BOOTCAMP - with no dedicated graphics and the cheapest 2.0ghz spec Macbook Pro 2016.

So far this computer has not backed down. It runs everything I throw at it, even complex editing in FCPx.

My old ASUS Zenbook with i7-6500U, GTX 940m and 16gb ram would get a bit better performance in games, though not by a huge margin, and editing on site was such a pain and exporting a 5-min rush on site in Premiere could take 25-30min. In FCPx it takes me less than real-time, around 2-4min for a 5min edit.

For anyone doubting the performance of this machine, don't. It's not meant for gaming, but if you, like me, enjoy a bit of casual gaming here and there, it can do it.

Also, the battery has been great and lasted me around 9 hours of casual use and 4-5 hours of editing in FCPx.",325,413,2016-12-11,AAPL,0.05816520005464554,0.908740758895874,0.03309399634599686

The Airpods have great battery life, and one of the lowest prices in this product category. They can automatically switch between your phone, laptop, and apple watch. They are not personally for me, but they are a very competitive headphone in the truly-wireless earbud space.

apple,Hands-on with the AirPods - First Impressions,"EDIT: I've gotten some comments and PMs about how I managed to get them so early. I write for a magazine and our country's Apple reps usually loan us the products for a long-term review.

Picture of AirPods: http://imgur.com/a/79mqJ

I just got the Apple AirPods in the mail and have been been playing with them for a few hours now, listening to music and making calls. These are my first impressions so far.

**Sound Quality**
While not exactly audiophile territory, I must admit that they are quite decent with a solid bass and crisp treble (edit: mixed up the two adjectives here in initial post). *Hotel California* sounded great on this. The soundstage is also surprisingly more expansive than I thought. However, be warned that the AirPods are not noise-isolating so you can pretty much hear everything that's going on around you.

EDIT: A number have asked me about the sound quality of the EarPods compared to the AirPods. In a quiet environment, the bass and soundstage is slightly better. However, in a noisy environment, these small differences can hardly be noticed since the AirPods neither cancel nor isolate noise. Having said that, I do understand sound is a subjective topic and your experience might vary from mine.   

**Phone Calls**
Wow, I was blown away. Activating Siri is just a double tap away on either AirPods, and Siri understood me even when I was in heavy traffic. The people I called could hear me clearly, even when I was whispering or when I was in a relatively noisy public area. Top marks for this.

**Stability In Ears**
I admit it feels like it will easily drop out of the ears but I did a few metal rocker head movements, a couple of violent skips and hops and shadowboxing, and the AirPods stayed snugly inside my ear canals.

**Build Quality and Ease of Use**
Solid all-around with a resounding magnetic click each time you put the AirPods into the box to charge. It's easy to connect to your iPhone too and took me less than 10 seconds. Also your iPhone will display the battery percentage of the case and the AirPods each time you open the case. Nifty touch.

FURTHER EDIT: I played around with it a bit more and the pop-up and widget does display battery life on a single AirPod if you are just in the habit of using one side.",300,279,2016-12-14,AAPL,0.05173731595277786,0.9159896969795227,0.032272953540086746

iphone,Death in the family. Family in need of help with locked iPhone. Apple/Sprint reps needed.,"In short, our family lost a beloved son and father this past Sunday.

Someone he was with when he died, kept his phone and wallet from the family for over a week, and when we got it back, we tried the password we had for him one time and it instantly locked the phone. Someone had tampered with his phone *nine times* and left the final time for us to lock it and prevent us from getting the information we needed. 


What can we do to recover data on the phone? Some facts about my cousins phone. 

He did not own a pc of his own.
 
The phone was relatively new. He'd had it about a month. 

His parents home where he lived, did not have the internet. 

He may have accessed wifi at work. 


I'm fully aware that when an iphone is locked, there's literally nothing that exists that can break the encryption. I'm certain the person who messed with the PW understood this. 

So what now? Is there a cloud that Iphone7's are automatically linked to? Can we get the call/text records from Sprint with a death certificate? Could we restore it to a point from a store with proper documentation? Obviously the parents have his original birth certificate and can get the death certificate. 

We need to retrieve as much information as we can about who he had contact with the night of his death. I've got a group of enraged males I'm trying to keep from going vigilante on the person who kept his phone from us. Is there anything we can direct this energy to to get answers?

Thanks for your time.

I specifically didn't wanted a canalphone because they cause an ungodly thumping in my brain when I jog and the noise isolation is more likely to get me run over on the road. I'm not an audiophile but I do own some decent cans.

**Sound quality:** They sound great for what they are, certainly better than the stock earpods. The bass has a little bit of a kick to it without being overwhelming. I really didn't like the high end straight out of the box but that has improved greatly with a short break-in. I would want something better when sitting down in a comfy chair specifically to enjoy music. They don't compare well with my Shure SRH1540s but that's not what they're about.

**Bluetooth:** Rock solid. My previous bluetooth earphones from Philips would make an unpleasant static noise and drop out for a split second every few minutes. Hasn't happened yet with the airpods. The range is also good. I got 22 paces from my iPhone indoors before the airpods started dropping out. The dropout was also quite graceful with a slow decline in sound quality.

**iDevice connectivity:** Open the box, hit okay on the one off pop-up on you iPhone and you're good to go. I wanted these for jogging with my watch without my phone so ease of swapping between the devices was important to me. Swapping between the phone and the watch is as simple as hitting ""play"" on the device you want to use. If you're listening to music from your watch and start a Youtube video on your phone then the watch will pause and the music and cut across to the phone. Press play on the watch again and you're back to music from the watch. It takes a second to swap but it's all automatic. My only grievance is that sometimes it seems to swap on it's own - eg on returning from a jog without the phone it decided to cut back to the phone by itself when I got back into range.

**Battery:** I haven't run it from 100% to 0% yet but extrapolating from the battery meter I would say that I'm on track from about 3h based on my use at about three quarter volume. This is no doubt very imprecise given how unreliable battery gauges are. The box design is nice. The buds click in with a magnet and won't fall out if you give the case a shake while upside down. The lid also has a fairly strong magnetic closure so hopefully it won't pop open in the backpack.

**Fit:** No surprises really - pretty much the same as the stock buds but a little bigger. They suit my ears but YMMV. I have found them to be very secure. I went on a 3.5km jog and the only time one was at all close to coming out was when I accidentally rubbed my arm across my ear while wiping sweat from my brow. Other than that they didn't either even shake in my ears. Pace varied between 4 &amp; 5 min/km. I also did a bit of an unconventional workout with kettlebells, a mace and a slam bag. No dramas there either. I haven't gone cycling with them yet but I'm feeling optimistic after trying them on with my helmet.

**Interface:** It's hard to imagine a more quintessentially ""Apple"" interface. There are no buttons on the buds at all. Play/pause by insertion/removal works flawlessly and is pretty handy. The double tap for Siri hasn't been quite as reliable for me and I've needed to try again on a few occasions. I really wish Siri offered at least basic functionality when working with the watch by itself. Does it really need an internet connection to understand ""Hey Siri, fastforward""?",200,452,2016-12-19,AAPL,0.0673886090517044,0.8932121992111206,0.03939912095665932

apple,AirPods - First Impressions,"Having used AirPods for a few hours today, I can say the audio quality is **better than standard Apple EarPods**, however, you do have a little bit of that ambient/white noise lingering around that you get with any Bluetooth earphones/headphones at low volume. Once you pass about the second notch on the volume, this disappears.


Unlike my Bose wireless headphones, I can't notice any lag whatsoever with the audio. **Everything syncs perfectly!** These things can go super loud too!


I tried shaking my head around like an idiot to see if they'd fall out, they didn't. I'll update this post later today when I see how they handle during exercise.


Setup was instant. The dental floss packaging is super sleek too! Pretty happy!


Switching between devices with AirPods is super easy, **but there is a delay**.


After iCloud automatically pairs the AirPods amongst all of your enabled devices, you can literally just hit play on any of your devices and the AirPods will automatically switch to them. No bluetooth menu required.


On the Mac, I had to initially select AirPods as the device I wanted to listen to. Now that I've done that, I can switch between listening to music/audio between my iPhone, Watch and Mac by merely pressing the play button on the device I want to listen to.


I am experiencing a delay of switching between devices between 2 seconds, all the way up to 30 seconds if I switch between iPhone to Mac. Delay is significantly shorter if I'm *not* playing music on a device while switching. This *could* also be because I'm running beta software, though. Switching between iPhone and Watch only takes a couple of seconds.


In practice, I don't think the delay of switching audio source will be that noticeable since I don't switch between devices the often when listening to music.


**Other things to note:**

* I charged my AirPods from ~30% to 100% in **under 20 minutes**.
* The casing has some weight to it, it just feels like quality, despite being plastic. There's a metal hinge, so I'm not worried about the cap snapping off when I open the case.
* They work well with the Apple TV, but there's no fancy iCloud pairing. Understandably so, given the TV is a multi-user system.
* Removing an AirPod while playing **YouTube in Safari on the Mac will pause the video** (presumably other HTML5 videos too).
* I actually tried to grab the remote on my old EarPods to adjust the volume before realising they don't exist. I am now getting used to **using my Apple Watch as my remote control** for AirPods.
* Double-tap is a bit hit-and-miss, but I think that's just a matter of me getting used to it. I've changed my setting to play/pause music, rather than activate Siri on my Mac.
* **Using Siri on Mac sounds heavily compressed**, as in super-low quality. Hopefully this can be fixed in a software update.

Overall, 9.5/10, extremely happy at how easy it is to switch between devices, and the audio quality is definitely a slight, but noticeable step up if you're listening above ~15% volume to hide that obligatory bluetooth white noise. The whole package just feels like quality, and I love how Apple have even hidden the certification logos within the case and under the AirPod's ear piece (pic: https://chrismorris.org/images/airpods-regulatory-symbols.jpg).

iphone,"PSA - when buying used iPhone, do full Reset with seller.","So, I met up with a seller to buy his used iPhone. During the transaction, he logged out of his iCloud account on the phone (I double checked). I tested the phone, and it was fine, gave him cash, and walked away. At home, I decided to wipe the phone through a Restore/Update in iTunes. After doing so, it prompts me for the seller's iCloud information! It's been a few days, and the seller have not properly removed the device from his account, rendering the phone useless.

So, the lesson is - when purchasing second hand, make sure you do a Reset Settings and Content with the seller, because it will prompt for the iCloud credentials even if they are logged out of iCloud.

This is normal behavior since iOS7, I believe, from my research.
Hope this saves someone from an expensive lesson.

Edit: Well, as to whether or not this is normal behavior, I don't know. However, some Googling reveals that others have had similar issues since iOS7. I am not claiming that this will happen to you if you buy second-hand - this is merely to let you know that it's probably better to go one step further and do a factory reset with seller before you part ways, never to see or hear from each other again.",162,458,2016-12-20,AAPL,0.10773691534996033,0.8672080039978027,0.02505510114133358

""What happened at Apple, to be honest, over the years was... the goal used to be to make the best computers in the world. And.. that was goal 1. Goal 2, we got from Hewlett-Packard actually which was ""we have to make a profit"". Because if we don't make a profit we can't do goal 1. So, yeah, I mean we enjoyed making a profit, but the purpose of making a profit was so we can make the best computers in the world. Along the way somewhere those two got reversed. The goal is to make a lot of money and well, if we have to make some good computers well OK we'll do that... 'cause we can make a lot of money doing that. And, it's very subtle.. it's very subtle at first, but it turns out it's everything. That one little subtle flip... takes 5 years to see it.. but that one little subtle flip in 5 years means everything.""

However the pricing is pretty much on par with the MacBook based on what I've seen. The cheapest model I can find in the UK cost about £1300. That's for a laptop with a relatively slow i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and integrated graphics. I could get the nTB MacBook for only a £100 more but with faster (still integrated) graphics and a larger 256GB SSD . 

At the other end of the spectrum, the high end model of the Surface Book cost about £2650 pounds, thats only about £50 less than the high end 15 inch MacBook Pro with touch bar model despite having surprisingly weaker graphics but roughly the same specs in everything else. 

I'm not justifying the price of Apple's MacBooks and both cost more than they should by a large margin but Microsoft isn't any better.",381,391,2016-12-23,AAPL,0.060693297535181046,0.8615080118179321,0.07779867947101593

apple,"Lost an AirPod on day one, replacement process was interesting.","I'm probably one of the first people to lose an AirPod.  Lets just say alcohol was involved.  After tearing apart my apartment and car looking for it, I gave up and went to Apple to order the $70 replacement.

There was lots of back and forth between managers and geniuses, but eventually they came back and said losing it was ""covered under warranty"" and I didn't have to pay.  I was genuinely confused, as were they, but they showed me the invoice and placed the order.  They also proceeded to take my remaining AirPod and case, telling me a new set would arrive in 6 weeks.

Fast forward to today and I get a call from Apple, they're in the store and ready to be picked up.  I walk in and am handed a brand new set.  I got some nasty looks from people who were there hoping they would have some in stock.

I'm assuming this is just a glitch and the replacement process hasn't been ironed out yet, but if you do lose one, it could be worth going to get a replacement sooner than later.",235,1910,2016-12-24,AAPL,0.1370474398136139,0.8274872899055481,0.035465266555547714

apple,I didn't realize how much until I wanted AirPods until I actually tried them out.,"I met up with my friend yesterday who's back for winter break. His dorm is about two blocks away from an Apple Store and on launch day he managed to walk over, stand in a line of 10 people, and get a pair. 

He kept telling me how good they were but I didn't really seem to get the hype. 

After trying them out, the first thing I noticed was they actually do stay in my ears much better than EarPods. I shook my head around pretty hard as a test too, and nothing happened. They actually do sound a bit better, too. 

The removing one from your ear-auto pause is a great feature, but I found I was able to have conversation with him, while still having both on at 50% volume. 

It's really easy to share music with a friend, instead of trying to reach the wire between the two of them you just hand them one of the AirPods and it works fine. 

The thing that got me the most was how much it feels like you're not actually wearing them. Every time I got up, I found myself automatically reaching for my phone as if there was still a wire.

Sorry to add to the amount of AirPods posts, but I want it to be known if you're on the fence, or don't understand the hype: try em.",308,526,2016-12-24,AAPL,0.030627980828285217,0.9188570380210876,0.05051494762301445

apple,Staff Surprised Me With AirPods at Apple Store Today,"So I have been lining up for AirPods for the past few days at one Apple Store, all without much luck. I did have an online order, but I was late on that and it showed that it will only come in six weeks.

I was waiting on a friend inside a mall, and they had an Apple Store, so I walked in and checked if they carry any. No luck.

Anyway, I asked one staff member if I could test them out since they have a few demo units at every store so customers could try before they buy. He took me to a table and set up the demo unit to work on my iPhone. As I was testing it, he asked if the AirPods were good. I said yes, and casually mentioned that how I have been out of luck trying to buy a pair so far. He told me to stay exactly where I am, while he heads off to the back.

5 minutes later he came back, and told me that even if the ones they have are for warranty replacements, they are willing to sell me a pair.

I was ecstatic, shook hands with the guy, and he brought me to the back of the store where I was told to wait once more while he retrieved a pair. We had to transact it discreetly as it might cause some racket with what he said, ""some thirty customers"" that also came for AirPods but left empty-handed.

My Apple Pay transaction went through and he sent me on my way, wishing me Merry Christmas and told me to enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised.

apple,A complete guide to securing yourself &amp; your Mac.,"Hello All,

Many people ask me: ""I know Macs are safer than most PCs, but what extra steps can I take to ensure I am secure both online, and off?"". Throughout the years, in part thanks to some paranoia, I have collected a few practices that I think most people should follow. Also, being the holiday season, I'm assuming many people might have gotten new Macs, so this is a good time to go through this. It is my hope that by following some, or all of these points, you can feel a bit more safe while using your Mac!

**Important Note: NOTHING I post here is mine. This is all common knowledge/solutions that exist, I simply have compiled them into a list for convenience. I am in no way taking any credit for any of these practices, I am merely promoting their use. Additionally, if anyone else has anything to add, or change, please make yourself heard, I am not claiming to be a security expert, just someone who is aware!**

1. [Use 2 factor authentication](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915). This one is a no-brainer, and one that I really hope everyone is already using! If you are heavily invested into the Apple ecosystem, as I am, the number one thing you don't want hacked is your Apple ID! It has credit cards, addresses, purchase history, everything on it! Make sure you utilize two-factor authentication to ensure that if someone hacks your iCloud password, they still can't access your account unless they have another trusted device of yours. This one alone can help immensely!

2. [Use a firmware password on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455) This is another one that is a no-brainer to me. Basically, when you set up your Mac, you give it an account password to unlock the computer and get into your user account. What a firmware password does, is lock down the entire *operating system*, making it unable to boot until the firmware password is entered. This is crucial, because if your Mac is stolen, and you don't have a firmware password, they can simply boot into macOS recovery mode and reinstall macOS, essentially making it impossible for you to ever track your computer through Find my Device. **Important Note : make this password *different* than your normal user account password! Also, never forget this password, as doing so makes for a very, very tedious process requiring you to find your original proof-of-purchase (receipt) of the Mac and a service appointment at an Apple Store**.

 EDIT: Building on this point: /u/jmnugent added a great piece of advice: You can actually set a [custom Lock screen message](https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/mac-lock-screen-message/). This makes it so if your Mac is stolen or lost, can be returned to you (given you provide contact info). Additionally, if you have a firmware password, the thief wont be able to override this message, which is great because if they take it into a specialist to try to get it wiped, the specialist will see the lock message and pretty quickly be able to tell its stolen. 

3. [Make Sure Find my Mac is enabled at all times](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my-iphone.html) Im sure you all know what this is so I wont go into it as it is extremely self explanatory. However, with a Firmware Password, this is even more powerful, as you can lock it from iCloud.com, and then prevent your computer from ever booting while you track the thief.

4. Backups, Backups, Backups! In this online age less and less people are feeling the need to backup data. This is a terrible mindset. There are literally *tons* of methods to backup so I wont go to into depth. Personally, I do the following:
 1. [Automatically backup my Documents/Desktop to iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206985) Like most people, 95% of my data is stored within these two locations on my Mac. Having this on ensures that if my Mac crashes, I can always have a copy of my most important documents available. Extra iCloud storage is very cheap, I think I pay like 3/month for 200GB. There are also tons of other providers that can do this for you: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Dropbox all have cloud storage that can be set up to automatically backup your most important files. 
 2. [Use Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) As extra redundancy, consider purchasing a extra hard drive you can use locally. This mirrors your entire Mac, so if it crashes, you can restore it exactly how it was. Hard Drives are *extremely* cheap nowadays, and you *don't* need to get an expensive one to do this!

5. Consider using a password manager. **It's a common misconception that hackers can 'hack' your password easily**. Most hackers have a database of commonly used passwords that they test against your account ([Most people have ridiculously stupid passwords](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/01/26/most-common-passwords-revealed---and-theyre-ridiculously-easy-to/)). Other methods for hackers involve brute forcing their way into guessing your password, which, if you have a semi-secure password, can literally take longer than the **life of the universe** to guess! With a single lowercase letter, a brute-force approach needs to guess 26 things, add in digits, it becomes 36 things, add in uppercase, the brute force now needs to guess 62 different options for just that single character. The takeaway is that a long-password with a mix of lower/uppercase letters and numbers is very, very difficult, if not impossible, to guess.

 Using a password manager helps you create complicated passwords like this, and there are many options. iCloud Keychain, if you are heavily invested into Apple/Safari use, 1Password, LastPass, Keeper Desktop, etc.

 EDIT: As some may have pointed out in the comments, try to *never* use the same password. I know this is tedious as hell, and can make for quite the headache, but it is more secure. Most people use the same password for everything. Many hackers, if they are able to hack into one of your accounts, may then try to apply that email &amp; password combo to a host of other sites to see if they work. Don't let that happen!

6. **Keep your Mac up-to-date at all times.** As a university student, I shudder when I see somebody who has a relatively new Mac, and I see they are 1-2 macOS versions behind, or that they have ignored the ""Important Updates Waiting to be Installed"" notification for a year. I see this all the time. People, yes updates sometimes cause minor grievances, but they are literally released to help patch up security flaws. If Apple thinks the problem is worth fixing, they will send out an update. Listen to Apple and update!

7. [Use FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) Not going to get into the technical bits of this, basically it encrypts your Macintosh HD using a industry-standard XTS-AES 128 bit encryption. Really good!

 As /u/DomPhotography pointed out below, make sure you also use this to encrypt any external drives that have your data on them (such as Time Machine external hardrives)

8. If you are not a very technical person, consider only allowing apps to be downloaded from the App store or identified developers. Most technical people I know can spot a malicious program from a mile away, but this is obviously not the case for everyone. Go to **Sys Prefs --&gt; Security &amp; privacy --&gt; General** to see where Apps are allowed to be downloaded from. If you don't trust yourself, only download from the App Store! This isnt an insult at your intelligence, simply being vigilant. 

 Additionally, consider doing research on every program you download. It takes a few seconds to google the program name and you'll find out pretty quickly if its safe!

9. **Make sure you Firewall is on**. The standard fire wall that comes with macOS is great and catches just about anything. Make sure it is on, by going to Sys Prefs --&gt; Security &amp; privacy --&gt; Firewall.  

10. **See which Apps have location services enabled** Do this by going to Sys Prefs --&gt; Security &amp; privacy --&gt; Privacy. As a general rule of thumb, no app should be collecting location data unless you absolutely need it to, or if you use it for some sort of time/location based logic, such as f.lux. 

11. If you follow these general, practices, you **shouldn't need extra security software**. This is a **BIG** one. So many people download fraudulent ""Cleaning"" apps that are quite literally cancer for your Mac. Anything that claims to ""clean"" or ""secure"" your Mac, is probably fake(side note: Im working on making a list of apps that are definitely dangerous, AFAIK nobody has compiled a recent list like this) . If you *feel like you must* run extra software, get it from a reputable developer. Amongst these, [Norton Symantec](https://uk.norton.com/norton-security-for-one-device), [Bitdefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html?clickid=3z40Rexnqx%3AgwY-1E0R2oTJpUkkXFX1FsSc2yU0&amp;bdaffc=global&amp;irgwc=1), and [Sophos](http://t.purch.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) are all great options. 

12. Watch out for Phishing. This one is **scary** nowadays. Developers make websites that look **exactly** like the real thing! Consider this recent case of how a developer made a login page that looked exactly like an Apple Site: [Link](http://lifeinlofi.com/2013/02/11/warning-apple-id-phishing-scam/). As a general rule of thumb, you can usually see if the website is legit or not by simply **observing the URL** before you click it. If it is something like **www.apple.com/login.php?** it is probably SAFE, but if it something like **www.apPle.hacje483.ch** it is definitely FAKE!. 

13. Whenever you visit a site that you enter your Credit Card into, **first check the URL bar**. If it starts with an 'https' then you should be safe (assuming the website is safe) to enter your credit cards the 'https' means that the communication is secure. If it simply says 'http' do not trust this website to reliably transport your credit card info!!

14. **Many people are paranoid about their webcams, and have them covered up with tape**. Let me first say, unless you are really stupid and got a terrible virus, **the little green light will always come on when your iSight is being used!**. However, if you are still paranoid, do the following:


 Spotlight Search ""Activity Monitor"" --&gt; Click the ""CPU"" tab at the top --&gt; Search for **""VDCAssistant""**. This is the process that uses the iSight camera. If its %CPU reads 0.0 percent, then it is not being used. 

15. Know your network. Any time you use your Mac in a public network, you put yourself at an elevated risk level. Of course, if you follow the previous 14 points i mentioned, this shouldn't be a problem, but it is important to know where you are, and who can see you from your network! 

 as /u/git pointed out int he comments, try to never connect to unsecure networks. These are the networks that do not require any password. When you connect o this, any and all of your traffic can be viewed.

16. **Never use an Admin account.** No offense, but most people aren't wise enough to be using an admin account. When you set up your Mac, make an admin account, and then make another user account that you will actually be using. You an check what type of account you have by going to :
Sys Prefs-&gt; Users &amp; groups and then observing what it says underneath the ""Current User"" Field. 

17. Never plug in a USB thumb drive unless you absolutely know what it is, or who it came from. USB drives can be loaded with executables that can carry out malicious tasks the second they are plugged in. If you find a USB stick, or SD card in the library, for example, **return** it or **leave** it, but do not plug it in!

18. Automatically update apps. Do this by going to Sys Prefs -&gt; App Store and checking for automatic updates. Just like with updating macOS, updating apps can also alleviate many security issues. 

19. For the love-of-God, always require your password for purchases in the app store. You may not believe it, but some people actually keep this off because ""it takes a lot of time"" Well, I can guarantee it'll take even *more* time trying to recover a ~~stolen credit card~~ purchases made on your account that were not approved by you!

20. As my final point, I want to make it clear that solving security issues is a **team effort**. If you discover a flaw, or patch, or virus, or whatever, please *share it!*. Nobody will think you are annoying or over-paranoid, the more people we have contributing to cyber-security, the better we all are!



I'm sure I missed some points, but this post is already ridiculously long, and for that I apologize.

apple,"""Gather"" is a terrible app and should be removed for the App Store for abusing its privileges.","Be me, last night right before going to sleep. I got a text from a number about an app called Gather and that my friend Kate was using it to chat with people. A friend named Kate and I had just spoken about a ski trip a few weeks ago. I think.. hey.. maybe I'm out of the loop and should download Gather.

I do. App looks legit, but no conversation waiting for me. Whatever. 

Be me, this morning. Get a text from my brother-in-law asking if I had invited him to Gather. Nope. I definitely didn't do that.

Gather looks at your contacts' info and takes it upon itself to text everyone on your behalf asking them to download their app!!!!

Is there anything outside of a poor review that could be sent to Apple alerting them of an app's egregious use of its privileges?

If any of the Gather devs are reading this right now, I hope you have a really bad day. 

edit: title should read ""FROM the App Store"". Can you tell I'm heated? Because I'm heated. I've revoked its rights to my Contacts and deleted the app since there was no way to delete the account.

-Recognizes your voice nearly perfect, everytime
-It can do more with less
-it doesnt have fucking witty comments everytime you ask something. This kills me. Siri is just just fool of half assed come backs.



EDIT- I want to explain something a bit more into detail.

apple,My experience with Airpod's after 7-day..,"A quick breakdown of what it's been like to own a pair, some of the good things and some of the not so great.

1. Working in an office, these things are great. I sometimes venture 20m away from my desk with walls in between, the connectivity never dropped once from my phone being left in the office. Zero problems with distance from phone as of yet. 

2. There's a load of videos already but it's worth mentioning that these do slightly differ from the EarPod design which gave me discomfort in the past. I no longer get aches after an hour or too and they fit incredibly well. There hasn't been a time yet where I've had to push them back in or adjust.  

3. Some really cool experiences I've had with them so far is walking around shopping, they get a lot of attention. I think this is still with it being a novelty but they definitely help with the mood while in a busy shopping centre. Things like washing the car, going to the gym and just cleaning up the house in general have became so much more fun without a trawling wire. 

4. Music Variety, weirdly I've begun experimenting with different music due to listening to a lot more. Maybe its a placebo but the sound quality seems different to the normal EarPods, there's more bass and they feel more immersive. 

5. The Mic's are very sensitive, people have had some issues with Wind from what I've read but I've used these down a high street during windy periods and people have had little problem in hearing me. They can also detect a whisper, kinda strange but they do pick up very quiet sound. I found this out while walking home late trying to be careful of waking the neighbours. 

Some issues I've had:

1. Dropped connection, this has happened twice so far. Once during music playback for no reason and another time during a call. I use an Apple Watch too and perhaps it's with so much going on, the AirPods are hit and miss with calls. 50% of the time, I'll answer on my phone and nothing will come through the AirPods. I generally have to call back. (Should point out this was early on and has gotten much better, although I've had no software updates. I use a 6s and when the dropped calls occur, my phone generally freezes for a few seconds too).

2. Music Playback, sometimes and although rare, they don't immediately play through my AirPods and I have to make sure they're selected as the output in Music. 

3. Double Tap, this has so far been the biggest frustration. It's something I barely use due to it just not picking up my taps at times. There's definitely a method for doing it, it's just not something I've mastered yet. (Someone suggested tapping three times which seems to be working very well for me) 

4. This leads into Siri, being in the UK, Siri seems very unreliable at times. Ever since the last iOS launched, Siri seems to take longer and asks me to wait at times. Using the AirPods, I've had little to no success in having Siri actually do what I what it to do. Maybe it's the accent but a lot of the time, I hear the chime to talk, I speak and then nothing happens. I believe its mainly to do with the data connection although I am generally city based with 4G. 

All things considered, I believe many of my issues are software based and over time will iron out. I'm not put off by any of them as the main function of them to listen to music is entirely unaltered. They are fantastic pieces of technology and I've come to carry them everywhere (generally in my watch pocket as it's an ideal size). I would highly recommend to anyone, the small teething issues is something I'm sure won't last very long. Just a check in for anyone that's interested. 

EDIT: Something that I enjoy doing when people ask to try them is tell them to take one out while listening to some music, the automatic pause always blows their mind. You can imagine the excitement they have when I tell them to put it back in and the music resumes. I was surprised at how little people knew about this feature. 

BONUS ADD: I didn't mention but probably should have done... they stay in very well. All ears are different but for me, these things don't wiggle at all. They're solid while there in and I've never had to adjust them yet.
I've used them at the gym for weight lifting and also running, no issues so far. This didn't surprise me however, I use EarPods and apart from the wire sometimes pulling them out, they stay in pretty well too. I'm told you can actually try them out in store so if you're curious, head to your local Apple Store.",205,490,2016-12-28,AAPL,0.05794234573841095,0.9106254577636719,0.031432218849658966

apple,"[eGPU] My experience with the 15"" tMBP (2016) and a 15"" MBP (2013) with the Razer Core","After reading about the experiences by /u/fakebanana and u/alwayslose using the Razer Core with the tMPB, I was confident enough to try it out. I hope this post will be helpful to others as those before me were immense help to me. In the following post I outline why an I think an eGPU is useful, why I chose the Razer Core and discuss the compatibility with a tMBP (2016) and an older MBP (2013) without USB-C.


**Why an eGPU?**

The mobility of a laptop is great because I am a student in university and I travel fairly often. However, mobility and the thin design of the MBP comes at a cost: performance. Having a an eGPU at my desk restores that performance with out having to manage a second computer.

**EDIT:** I do more video editing and use more graphics programs on macOS than I play games on Windows; therefore I would like to benefit from the performance gain on both OSs which is not possible if I built a separate gaming rig. I could build a hackintosh but then I don't benefit from the mobility. An eGPU allows me the best of everything :)


**Why the Razer Core?**

The Razer Core fulfills 4 criteria for me:

* acts as an eGPU case with an integrated PSU
* acts as a docking station because in addition to the ports from the graphics card it has 4x USB 3.0 ports and an ethernet port, it also charges the tMBP
* it looks good (to me at least and fits with the rest of my setup), all the wiring is taken care of which also leads into the next point
* it's easy to set up


**Why a GTX 980 Ti?**

From my research NVIDIA cards are better supported through the Web Drivers even though AMD cards have native drivers. Unfortunately, the newer 1000 Series (Pascal) NVIDIA cards are not supported via the Web Drivers. Therefore the best card considering cost/performance that I could find was a used GTX 980 Ti.


**Hardware used for testing**

* Razer Core
* Gigabyte GTX 980 Ti G1 Gaming
* touch-bar MacBook Pro (2016), Core i7 2.9 GHz, Radeon Pro 460
* Macbook Pro (2013), Core i7 2.3 GHz, NVIDIA GT 750M
Required for older MBP that does not have USB-C:
* Apple TB2 to TB3 Adapter
* Apple TB2 Cable


**Installation**

At the time of testing, macOS 10.12.2 and Windows 10 64bit via bootcamp were used. The installation for Mac was simple while Windows required some more complicated steps.


for macOS:

* the core will shows as ""Core - Unsupported"" in System Information &gt; Hardware &gt; Thunderbolt
* apply [TB3-enabler](https://github.com/KhaosT/tb3-enabler) script and reboot
* the Core will no longer be shown as unsupported
* apply [automate-eGPU](https://github.com/goalque/automate-eGPU) script to install the NVIDIA web drivers and patch the necessary kexts
* enable automatic mode with the -a flag
* reboot and the eGPU should work


Note: You must plug the Core into the MBP while macOS is running and then restart without removing the Core. Also you cannot modify the Chroma settings using Razer Synapse in Mac.


for Windows:

* check the Device Manager to make sure the Core is connected
* install Razer Synapse if you would like to change the chroma settings
* install video drivers directly from NVIDIA for your graphics card
* check the Device Manager for graphics card, which for me showed error-12 cannot find resources (to my understanding this happens when your graphics card has more than 4GB of VRAM and therefore requires a 64bit allocation of resources instead of the standard 32bit)
* to fix this a DSDT override is required (see below)
* reboot and the eGPU should work


Larger Memory fix based on a thread from [eGPU.io](https://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/fix-dsdt-override-to-correct-error-12/):

* download this [DSDT Editor](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?pnp2s67dhg3knly)
* run DSDT Editor.bat
* File &gt; Extract DSDT and wait
* Scroll through text to find DWordMemory which is 32bit
* After the last DWordMemory entry add a QWordMemory entry which is 64bit

    `QWordMemory (ResourceProducer, PosDecode, MinFixed, MaxFixed, Cacheable, ReadWrite,`
      `0x0000000000000000, // Granularity`
      `0x0000000C20000000, // Range Minimum,  set it to 48.5GB`
      `0x0000000E0FFFFFFF, // Range Maximum,  set it to 56.25GB`
      `0x0000000000000000, // Translation Offset`
      `0x00000001F0000000, // Length calculated by Range Max - Range Min.`
      `,, , AddressRangeMemory, TypeStatic)`

* IASL &gt; Compile
* If you get errors those need to be corrected, I simply commented out the offending lines though this is not the correct way to do this
* IASL &gt; Save as DSDToverride.aml and File &gt; Save as DSDToverride.dsl
* Open Command Prompt (Admin) and go to the downloaded Folder
* Load new table configuration

    `asl /loadtable DSDToverride.aml`

* Enable test signing for override to be accepted

    `bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON`

* Reboot and check if you have a new Large Memory entry in Device Manager &gt; Resources by Connection &gt; Memory


Note: You must unplug and replug the Core after Windows has started so that it reallocates the graphics card to the larger memory. After this the Core is hot pluggable unlike in macOS.


**Benchmarks**

**EDIT:** Alright so here are some benchmarks (I am at my parents for the holidays so I had to dig up an old screen from the basement where the max resolution was 1680x1050).


for macOS:

* Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0: FPS 100.7, Score 2537, min. FPS 10.5, max. FPS 192.4


for Windows:

* Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0: FPS 120.3, Score 3031, min. FPS 9.3, max. FPS 244.7


It seems that the Core performs better under Windows than macOS. I'll have to try my 2K screen when I get back home. If you want me to perform any other test, let me know. Ill post a video soon showing the setup.

**Known Issues**

* if FileVault is enabled, macOS will not load until after logging in and therefore cause screen tearing upon log in
* Closing the lid of the MBP does not disable the internal display, it remains active even though the screen is black. Using an [app](https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor) to do this manually is a work around.
* Unplugging the Core on macOS will crash the MBP
* ~~Windows on the MBP (2013) does not recognize the Core, not sure why but this is still a WIP~~ Windows does recognize the eGPU after some messing around and un/reinstalling TB drivers (can't really say what I did but it decided to work at one point). However, the USB and Ethernet ports on the core do not work.


**Closing Thoughts**

Overall Im really happy that the Core works with the tMBP in macOS and Windows. It's not perfect but as an early-adopter I can deal with a few bugs here and there. I believe in the future this set up will become more common and therefore better supported.


I have only had the Core for a few days but will try to keep this post updated as I learn more.


**Video**

**EDIT:** Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B29TL9vQoQ0) of the setup as promised. I didn't have access to the older MBP (2013) because it's not mine but I will try to show it later.",160,573,2016-12-30,AAPL,0.042193956673145294,0.9042810201644897,0.05352500453591347

apple,AirPods + Watch is getting really close to the post-phone interface,"This is a really amazing combination. I could see keeping just a single AirPod in at work and on the go pretty much constantly, and using my watch to route and control the content on it while rarely touching my phone. 

In the movie ""her"" his chic leather wallet style phone should have just been a watch.

Glasses/AR really feel inevitable at this point, and you can really start to see what comes ""next"" after iPhone. It's kind of this constellation of devices offloading functionality from the phone. Apple is way ahead here I think, but I think that is pretty far under the radar for a lot of folks at this point. 

I have been pretty unimpressed with Apple this year especially with the Mac lately but AirPods are a mind blowing product that are giving me the kind of connection to product the old iPods gave me. I think without a watch though I would not like them nearly as much.",106,327,2016-12-30,AAPL,0.02645895630121231,0.9262174367904663,0.047323547303676605

apple,"All iPhone tricks in one posting , x-post from r/iPhone","1) Tapping comments and stories in Alien Blue with 2 fingers gives up votes, 3 fingers give downvotes.

2) Swipe left ""Low Power Mode disabled"" notification to enable it again.

3) Swipe up on two or even three apps at a time with multiple fingers in task switcher to close all quickly.

4) Hold the '.com' button while typing URL, its gives other domains like .net or .org, so you don't have to type it. 

5) Another AlienBlue tip: Two finger swipe from left to right on a comment will give you that comment's full thread of replies.

6) Tapping ""123"" then tapping the character you want then finally clicking back to the main keyboard can be a hassle. Instead hold down ""123"", slide thumb to character you want to use then let go. The character will be inputted and your keyboard will be back to normal.

7) Tapping the clock/top bar on a page will take you quickly to the top.

8) Tap chunk of text with 2 fingers to highlight the whole thing. Works only when commenting/editing etc.

9) Be careful, actually there is no proofed solution to turn this off again! If you go into the phone app, and dial *3001#12345#* (add * before and after the number) and hit call, the ""Field Test"" application opens, which allows you to see the numerical value of your cellular reception, along with other information about the surrounding cell towers. In addition, if you hold down the power button until the ""Slide to power down"" slider comes up and then hold down the home button until the app exits, you can tap on the carrier name in the top left corner to change between the numerical value and the visual representation (in bars) without going into ""Field Test"" mode.
The values are always negative. In my experience, around -50 is pretty much the best reception possible, while about -120 is the lowest you can go without losing reception. Anything above -80 is good, and would be considered full bars Anything below -100 is bad, and would be considered few bars

10) Double click the upper case arrow to set caps lock

11) Force close a single app by holding the power button until the slide to power off slider appears, then press and hold the home screen button. It will close any app that you are in and also remove it from the RAM, forcing it to completely reload upon re-opening. Fixes many problems.

12) This may have been obvious but you can zoom in and out in the default Camera app by using two fingers to pinch and spread.

13) You can use more than a 4 digit PIN number. By turning off ""Simple Password"" and choosing only numbers instead and NO letters. You will get a number keypad to unlock the phone instead of a full keyboard. And you can use as many numbers as you would like and you you have to press OK to enter it. This makes your PIN number much much harder to guess. Since you would need to not only guess the number but also how many digits the pin contains to break in.

14) Swipe away banner notifications that inhibit you pressing a button on the top of the screen by swiping from RIGHT TO LEFT (will not work L TO R).

15) In Mail, holding the ""New Email"" button will display all your recent drafts.

16) Tapping the screen with two fingers while in Maps will zoom out

17) Add a shortcut for your email address (example @@). It makes filling in online forms much, much easier.
Settings &gt; general &gt; keyboard &gt; shortcuts

18) Put a tracking number for UPS or some other mail services in a text field (notes, e-mail, text) and it becomes a link to the tracking website.

19) To continue listening to a video or music video from safari after exiting safari, just double click the home button, go to music controls, and press play. Also works on the lock screen, useful for music videos, etc.

20) Sleep Timer - While playing music in the Music App , toggle to the clock app click timer, click ""when timer ends"", scroll to bottom, click stop playing. Start Timer.

21) Pressing the volume buttons when alarm clock goes off for the snooze. I've caught myself accidentally turning it off instead of pressing the snooze button and find this method much safer and easier.

22) If you turn on accessibility settings you can tap out a custom vibration pattern or make the bright camera LED flash when you get a call or text. Then go into contacts, hit Edit and you can select the vibration below the ring tone. From iOS 6, the custom vibration settings have moved to Settings &gt; Sounds. You click on each individual alert type and you have to option to set a custom vibration.

23) If you're getting a call you can just press the lock button to mute it instead of pressing decline. Pretty useful for when your phone starts blasting in your pocket during a class or meeting! Works also with the volume keys.

24) Holding the keyboard globe icon gives you a list of keyboards that are on.
Swipe from leftmost of screen to right in camera to access the camera roll instead of clicking it from the bottom.

25) In camera app, use the volume buttons as a picture clicker.

26) To reset the new message counter. Lets say you have a bunch of unread emails and you don't want to click through all of them. Click edit, select the first message, hold down the Mark button and click the same message to unselect it. Voila! All the messages are selected! Click Mark as unread.

27) When websites have embedded content that scrolls (like an extra area with scrollbars), you can use 2 fingers to navigate through it. This works with textareas for example.

28) You don't have to swipe the homescreen to go to the next, you can simply tap the left corner/right corner right above the first and forth icons on the dashboard. See screenies: http://i.imgur.com/zNR0M.png

29) Here's for the lazy ones: end a phone conversation by pressing the lock button. This way, you can terminate the call and locking the screen in one press.

30) If you want to search for a word on a page with safari, enter it in the web search box on the top right and scroll all the way down, past the suggestions until it says 'on this page'.

31) You can use rich text styling in the mail app. Select some text and bring up the context menu, then press the arrow right. You can use bold, italics, underline, and indenting.

32) *#06# displays your iPhone's IMEI. Good to take down if you don't have the original box around you. You'll need the IMEI if your phone gets stolen or dislocated, in order to file a report with the police and/or a claim with the insurance company.

33) Shake your phone to Undo.

apple,"How long until the AirPods design becomes ""obvious""?","The AirPods are getting rave reviews for their simplicity and functionality, and that got me thinking. How long do you think it will be before other companies copy the AirPods design and how long will it be before people say that it's not copying because the AirPods design is ""obvious""?

The AirPods are not the first wireless headphones to market. But they are the first with a focus on simplicity. While devices from Bragi and Jabra and Samsung and Motorola and others are trying to be these big, bulbous fitness devices that include everything and the kitchen sink, Apple has instead decided to focus squarely on simplicity. Instead of trying to cram as much into a large stone-shaped device, Apple instead focused its efforts on doing everything it can to create this user experience where you have the lightest, most portable, easiest-to-use listening experience possible.

Some of Apple's big design decisions to work towards that goal of hassle-free listening include:

* Using a proximity sensor to pause music when one AirPod is removed. Resume music when it is put back in your ear.

* Putting an inordinate amount of effort into improving the pairing process and the quality of connectivity.

* AirPods are automatically powered down when placed in the case so that you never have to worry about forgetting to turn them off.

* They have a small housing but a long stem to allow for better voice quality.

* The case has both a magnetized hinge and magnets to suck AirPods in, so that you don't lose them or have them fall out when fiddling with the case. The case is also compact enough to take everywhere you go, while also charging the AirPods without you having to think about it.

* One simple LED to indicate the charge status of the AirPods (when they're inside) and the case (when they're not inside).

**The thing with all of these design decisions is that they seem ""obvious"" after the fact. Before AirPods, other wireless earbud manufacturers chose a very different design direction. But I'd be willing to bet that the next generation from Bragi and Samsung and so on - will refocus their priorities away from the kitchen sink approach and towards AirPods-esque ease-of-use. And when they do, people will point out that they're following in Apple's footsteps, to which there are going to be many Apple critics saying ""Apple didn't invent proximity sensors and long stems! Those designs were obvious!""**

apple,A Thank You to this sub and possibly a PSA to those who don't know about emergency calling from your Apple Watch.,"It's been a while since I sent a link I found here in this sub (I can't remember who made it to give credit and my thanks) to my children about the emergency calling from your Apple Watch. None of us realized that the watch had this feature so it was something we all sort of joked about accidentally setting off in the middle of adult related activities. 

Well Monday the 26th my son who's home for the holidays was on his way back to our home from a night out with old high school friends and got into an accident. He was driving down a gravel road which had recently been graded, if you're not from a rural area this is where they basically take all the gravel from the edges of the road and move it back to the center so the gravel can be much thicker than usual. After traveling down the road for a few miles a deer jumped out of the woods and my son over reacted to avoid the animal, but his tires caught in the gravel and caused his jeep to flip.

The vehicle rolled three times before coming to a stop upside down in the ditch. His phone was thrown from the mount on his dash to somewhere in the road (we've not actually found the phone yet and don't think we will since the weather has been rather crappy). He was physically stuck inside the vehicle upside down because the roof bent into an angle and he was wedged between it the steering wheel and the seat. He activated the emergency call feature and let the dispatchers know his location. It took about twenty minutes for rescuers to find and get to him, but without the watch he could have spent hours there before someone would have passed by.

After they got him out of the vehicle a state police officer and a firefighter tried to locate the phone but couldn't find it anywhere. My daughters were texted either during or directly after the call stating that an emergency call was made from my son so we frantically tried calling him and then calling 911 ourselves. Thankfully he's perfectly healthy and aside from a totaled phone, vehicle and finger wave from mom about not being on the emergency notification text (which turned out to be my own fault) everything is great and we're definitely not making jokes about the emergency calling feature any longer.

So here's the link I found here in this sub. I can't remember if it was an actual post or if I found it in the comments of one totally unrelated. Thank you to whoever posted it earlier this year!

Edit: forgot a word... Thanks 

Edit2: Many thanks to all the well wishes, and to all those PMing me about increasing my ""Google-fu"" when it comes to searching Reddit. My son expresses his thanks as well, and gave the typical ""but mommmmmmmm"" gasp when I told him I posted his story.

apple,Apple seriously needs to work on the back-end of Apple Music,"I had to restore my iPhone 6 for an annoying reason I won't get into. So after I restore my phone, my music is there but none of it is downloaded. Understandable. 

So I do the process to download all my songs again (making a smart playlist, downloading all). So almost all my songs are downloaded except for maybe one or two. 

Thus I tap the download icon at the top again because it's still buffering for those 2 songs and I don't want it to just buffer and aimlessly waste my battery (I also didn't absolutely need those songs). So when I tap this icon which is now the circle with the stop square in the middle, all of my songs that I just downloaded become undownloaded, just like that; instantaneously. 

So now I have to do the whole downloading process over again which took all night. 

I should also mention that I tapped this icon during the downloading process to start downloading some songs again because there were problems downloading certain songs. So I just did it to skip those hiccups. So it worked fine in those instances and didn't affect my whole library. 

I don't mean to just share my story, I want to know if anyone else has had similar problems and I just want it to be known that there are some serious glitches that can undo major processes like this and that should be fixed.",122,213,2016-12-31,AAPL,0.06249481812119484,0.9105358123779297,0.026969337835907936
