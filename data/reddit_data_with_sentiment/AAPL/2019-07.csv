AppleWatch,So yesterday I start a workout on my watch...,"I'm a 52-year-old male and I usually don't consider anything a ""workout"" unless the sole purpose is exercise. If I'm taking the dog for a walk, for example, I ignore the ""looks like you're working out"" message (I've since learned to disable that).

Anyway, after I start the workout I begin my walk. I'm moving at a brisk pace - not my quickest but not my slowest either. About 15 minutes in I'm about to start on my first steep hill. I glance at my watch because I want to see my heart rate before and after the hill. 120. Good, elevated but not too high. At the top of the hill I'm a little shorter of breath but not bad. I check my watch again. 130. Again, good. Now I'm on a level area (even slightly downhill) and before I start on the next (shallower) hill I check again to see what kind of recovery I have. 137. That's a little concerning. Why is it higher after I've been walking an easy part for a few minutes? Well, I figure that maybe I'm a little fatigued. Whatever. Still not bad. Finish the shallow hill and check again just before it moves into a steeper hill. 145. OK, this is really a bit concerning. I slow my pace to allow myself to recover as I walk up the steeper part. I'm almost at the top and I check again. 165. Ouch! I slow down to a shuffle and check a couple of minutes later. Surely I'm recovering now! 170!! Now I'm just getting worried that I might not be able to hit the SOS button before the heart attack hits!

It was at that moment that I realized I'd been looking at active calories the whole time which had, of course, been going up pretty steadily. My heart rate was 135. I chuckled and shook my head and headed for home.",51,931,2019-07-01,AAPL,0.0758630707859993,0.8721778392791748,0.051959067583084106

AppleWatch,Apple Watch saves me from being locked outside my house for hours in my boxers.,"I‚Äôve recently started having to go to back crazy early so I can get to work at 4am but my dogs have no gotten on the schedule yet and still want to go outside around 9 like we used to take them. 

So last night I get out of bed, and take them to the back yard via our sliding glass door. They do their business and I go to open the door again only to find it locked. Apparently the hinge the holds the lock lever is loose, so when I shut the door it knocked it down, locking the door with me outside. 

So there I am, super frustrated that this happened. Trying, with no regard for reason, to slide open the sliding door. I wasn‚Äôt going for long so I left my phone on my night stand, but luckily I wore my watch to bed that night and was able to call my wife to come home from work on her lunch to let me back in. 

So thanks Apple, for letting me make phone calls via Bluetooth or WiFi or however it‚Äôs connected, with my watch.",105,671,2019-07-03,AAPL,0.06261937320232391,0.8934643268585205,0.04391632601618767

apple,"App review has started investigating apps 2-3 days after approval/release, probably to catch review fraud.","Well this is interesting. Had coffee with a developer friend recently and he mentioned that his company has noticed some interesting activity on their apple review account.

He said that app review tends to take around 10-15 minutes. App review will go ""in review"" 4-5 hours before the first reviewer actually looks at it. Then someone will launch it and all the diagnostic logs start trickling in. They'll play with it for a bit. Launch/relaunch it a bit. Lots of force-quits.

The INTERESTING thing that had said started a few weeks ago was they would notice updates would get approved/released on one day. Then consistently ~48-72 hours after release they'd see the apple review account login again and poke around.

He suspected this was apple trying to catch app devs performing ""review fraud"", where the app's behavior changes with a server flag at a later date to try and bypass app store guidelines and such.

That's all the info I really have, as we only talked about it in passing. Just thought you guys would find it interesting as I haven't seen it talked about before/it was news to me.

iphone,Paid apps actually worth it in 2019?,"Sitting on $30 in iTunes credit. I‚Äôm sure these threads are fairly common, but things change. So what paid apps do you have that you feel are worth it or that everyone should have?

Edit: I have a 4.7"" iPhone 6s. I don't own any other Apple hardware (iPad, watch, TV, Mac, etc).

Paid apps I already have (or upgraded to pro features) include but aren't limited to: Night Sky, Monument Valley 1/2, Oceanhorn, Hidden Folks, Diaro (Pro), Printer Pro, Dark Sky, Opener, Adguard Pro, Unified Remote Pro, OurGroceries (ads removed), iShows TV, and Apollo for Reddit (pro/ultra). Absolutely open to alternatives to these if you think they're better!

Willing to save my money (I buy a decent amount of music) but $30 is a lot to just be sitting on, and my wife gave me some of it for our anniversary and I kind of want to say, ""I bought this thing to make my iPhone do this other thing,"" rather than ""it went to a few songs.""

Appreciate the replies!

Edit 2: Bought [Flacbox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flacbox-flac-player-equalizer/id1097564256), [Uzu](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uzu-an-interactive-light-show/id376551723), and [Scanner Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro/id333710667) so far! I appreciate the feedback so much! I've looked at a ton of apps, even apps that I wouldn't be interested in, because people said they were worth paying for. I've looked at a bunch, and gone back, and looked at them again.

I'm really tempted by [Paprika](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868), it looks way better than OurGroceries. We paid $15 for OG (wife's Android license, my Android license, my iOS license, $5 each) and Paprika will cost us $10 to switch to (since we'd both have to get it). And then the Windows app is $30 whereas OG is free on the web. So we could skip the Windows version since we almost never use OG on the computer anyway. And it has more features.

A lot of you are saying iCloud, but I have 1TB of OneDrive so I don't really see the need for another cloud, but $1/month isn't bad for 50GB. Sell me on it?

I might get a photo app but I'm not a pro photographer by any means, but, I am curious about a couple apps. I'll look more into more later! Really appreciate the replies! Keep 'em coming, but try not to duplicate... if your suggestion has already been given, please just upvote/reply to that.

AppleWatch,10 Apple Watch tips and tricks you probably didn‚Äôt know,"Since people repost these basic tips every week,  and every time many people are surprised they could do x or y, I figured I‚Äôd make a list of them

1.	When pinging iPhone from control center, hold down the button instead of tapping. Your phone will flash the flash ~~and screen~~ to make it easier to see. 

2.	If you want to open control center or Notification center from an app, just hold your finger on the top or bottom of the screen for a second. Then you can pull them down. 

3.	Force touch on the honeycomb app grid to change it to a list.

TV - Gone  
Bluetooth Speaker - Gone  
Wifes work Laptop (HP) - Gone  
DSLR Camera - Gone  
Logitech Headset - Gone  
Computer bag - Gone  


But my MacBook Pro 15"" on the other hand? They literally took it out of my computer bag and left it on my desk alongside my iPad and Apple TV.   


I was a bit confused at first and I can only think of two options.   
1. They have an intense personal dislike for Apple stuff?   
2. The reputation of iCloud and Find my Mac is a strong enough deterrent that it wasn't worth taking.    


Either way, I'm amused and amazed at the same time.

apple,"I build the Apollo Reddit app and I'm donating 100% of today's proceeds to our local SPCA animal shelter. It's kitten season and the hardest time of the year for shelters for food and supplies, so your help would be absolutely AMAZING in helping the kitties and puppies out there! üê∂üê±","Hey! My name's Christian, I build that [Apollo Reddit app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) that y'all have been so kind toward. Long story short I used to work at Apple and wanted to build a free alternative to the official app with a focus on really feeling like an iOS-first app (more details further down if you're curious).

A lot of people aren't aware but these warm months are ROUGH for shelters. They're when cats give birth in the greatest numbers, and it puts a massive strain on animal shelters to keep up with the influx of kitties, it's even named [kitten season](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/). Shelters become flooded with abandoned, injured, or orphaned kitties, and their resources are really really strained.

Our local shelter here in Nova Scotia is a no-kill shelter and seriously does amazing work with our local cats and dogs, I adopted my two cats Hugo and Ruby from them ([who sleep on my desk while I code haha](https://i.imgur.com/pSNPOGU.jpg)) and it's seriously run by the nicest people who care so much about the animals.

So yeah, **to try to help some today 100% of Apollo's proceeds (every penny I make) will be donated to the local SPCA animal shelter**. Apollo's free to download with a Pro version that adds some extra features, as well as an Ultra version that adds a few more, so if you unlock those today it'll be completely going to the animals and you get a little treat as a thank you for being awesome!

You might remember we did the same thing a year ago [and raised $5,000 for the SPCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/95ezsl/so_apollo_made_508723_yesterday_yeah_no_joke_just/). I really want to try to hit $10,000 this time, I really think we can do it! They were so stoked last year to find out of the blue and are working closer with me this year now, and even sent me a very cute bunch of photos of [some of the animals that were adopted this year](https://imgur.com/a/hwF5TmE).

Today's my birthday so I couldn't think of a better time. :P

### So I just buy one of the in-app purchases and it goes right to the charity?

Yep! Simple. :P

### What if I already bought Apollo in the past?

You're awesome! There's a ""Tip Jar"" in the Settings tab of the app you can add to, 100% of that will go to the shelter as well. :D Or check out the next section‚Ä¶

### Can I donate to the cause outside of the app or if I don't have an iOS device?

Absolutely! You can send money directly to the PayPal address tipjar@apolloapp.io and 100% will also go to the shelter and it'll add to the tally. You can also donate [directly to the shelter too](https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298)! 

That crypto wizard currency stuff works too! You can send Bitcoin to 1LamDwEtMYzeMF8F4evLVshgL6UaM1mU7e, or Ethereum to 0x53FDee21dCA9555Cd6d28089c8eA7E118d7189B6, or Nano xrb_1j7ppgbx47bbyk1ohbuy9nqghreo8pct8z1gcghyqj7kz7tmz9xnugjntx9k or Litecoin LQgNag4cmGTbedXQvahpi6eQydpSjgBWv6 and Monero 44vXYmhwn87MHQBa5hEiM3gP5gyCEk2dt2ciM7fGKoGFQRFyBt4oXWUNWSGMv7tDnQM4WbjALu54JR6oz7jrE5Qd4bymUNo. If there's any other kind of wizard money you want to donate just say so and I'll figure it out!

### Why? What's the point of Apollo when there's the official app?

I worked at Apple for a little while and was using Alien Blue, and really wanted to build a Reddit app that felt like if Apple themselves decided to build a Reddit app, something that felt perfectly at home on iOS. No knock on the official app (it's well done by talented people), but it doesn't follow a lot of the iOS design guidelines and feels a little Android-y to me at times. It's kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what's the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use. On top of this Apollo has some really slick custom gestures, a Jump Bar for quickly bouncing between subreddits, color-coded comments for easy navigation, a really powerful media viewer and it was voted the best Reddit app for iOS by [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/).

Plus it's a great cause so check it out even if you're not interested. :P

#### When will we know the total money we raised?

Tomorrow I'll post the total we raised as well as a proof of it being sent [just like last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/95ezsl/so_apollo_made_508723_yesterday_yeah_no_joke_just/) and we can rejoice in how much of a difference we made. Apple sends out the previous day's report the following morning. 

### Anything else?

uhhhh‚Ä¶ I'll donate an extra $0.10 for every comment on this thread by tomorrow. no spam tho plz

### I have other questions! 

Happy to answer them!! I'll be sticking around all day today so ask away! Thank you so much in advance! üê∂üê±üê∞

apple,"I don't even know how to title this, typing from the floor. We raised $27,355 yesterday. *TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS*. They told me that's the largest single day fundraiser IN THEIR HISTORY. Thank you so so so so so much, the Reddit Apple community is beyond incredible at saving animals. üê∂üê±üê∞","I legitimately have no idea how to start this and I refreshed the page a few different times over the course of 10 minutes to make sure I was seeing the right number.

I make a free Reddit app for iOS called [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), and yesterday you might have saw I [posted a little fundraiser here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cfmlca/i_build_the_apollo_reddit_app_and_im_donating_100/) in the Apple subreddit basically stating all the proceeds for the day from Apollo (it's free but has in-app purchases for some cool extra Pro/Ultra features) will go to the my local SPCA animal shelter in Nova Scotia. It's definitely the hardest time of the year for them right now, because cats give birth in tremendous numbers in these warm months (dubbed Kitten Season) which creates a massive influx of orphaned and abandoned kitties, and shelters are seriously strained and need all the help they can get.

I was hoping to do some good for the shelter, but legitimately in my wildest dreams I did not expect so many people to come out and give support, I'm truly unable to form cohesive thoughts right now. They are legitimately such great people at that shelter, just for one example we recently had a cat in the community who was found badly abused and they looked after her, helped her with her bad leg (it ended up requiring an amputation) and [now Phoebe got adopted into a loving home](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/phoebe-cape-breton-cat-shot-adoption-1.5201865). Like that's just one example.

I also got my two cats Ruby and Hugo from there. Here's Ruby spinning in circles in delight when I told her: https://i.imgur.com/QWyckgy.gifv and here's Hugo somewhat annoyed I woke him up to tell him but undoubtedly stoked inside: https://i.imgur.com/S5ztw0T.gifv

Here's a tally of the donations. It came mostly from proceeds for the day but also was helped immensely by people commenting ($0.10 per comment on the Apple thread, and [I also did an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cfnfu8/my_names_christian_selig_i_used_to_work_at_apple/)) and retweeting, as well as awesome PayPal and crypto donations. It's easiest to show the breakdown/proof with a pic: 

Pic: https://i.imgur.com/YLjn7da.png

I'm working with them to get the money over to them ASAP. I was legitimately not expecting to hit anywhere near this much, so I thought my credit cards would do but I don't have a limit high enough to pay this much in one go, so I sent over $16,000, which is all my cards could handle, and I promise I'll get the rest over as soon as I can figure that out (SPCA said it was totally okay, and Apple doesn't pay until the following month, so it's not as if I have the money right now). Proof of $16K (we're over half way there): https://i.imgur.com/vTcijTn.png

(And before anyone asks, as much as I wish it was, this is extraordinarily far far far far more than Apollo makes on a normal day obviously.)

Like this is absolutely nuts, I actually can't believe or wrap my head around that we raised this much money. We actually broke records. Like seriously, here's the most recent (2017) [document I could find on their donors](http://www.novascotiaspca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ANNUAL-REPORT-2017.pdf). Walmart donated $2,000 - $5,000 (which is amazing). Not that it's a competition (every donor is a hero), but we did 5-10x more than WALMART for reference! How are we that awesome. I talked to them this morning and they said they were crying.

You have made my week, month, year, everything with this generosity. If you got Apollo Pro or Ultra yesterday I genuinely hope you love it and I'll continue to work my tail off to create the best Reddit app possible for all of you. Thank you so much again.

apple,I Took Apple To Court And Won (Twice) 'Water Damaged' &amp; Out of Warranty Mackbook Pro,"**First Court Case: Water 'Damaged' MacBook Pro**  


So I've just read this article on Reddit ([I Fought Apple and Won](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aiknf4/i_fought_apple_and_won/)) and thought I'd share my victory as well. It was the end of 2017 when my 13"" Macbook Pro started to act strange. With just 1 month remaining of the default 1-year warranty, the screen began to peel off. It was in the middle of my PhD and needed to do a lot of reading and writing and my eyes where getting tired very fast while trying to distinguish between L, l, i, I, o, O, and 0, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Went online, did a quick search and discovered that's a common issue with specific models. Also, it seemed that Apple was aware of the issue and had a free replacement program in place. A program that covered all devices, in or out of warranty. Happy to see that I've booked an appt with Apple and they had a next day slot at Apple Milton Keynes, UK.

&amp;#x200B;

At the store, I've explained to the genius tech that while the peeling off is affecting the aesthetic of the device, it only bothers me as it prevents me from using it, especially now when I need to read a lot. The agent visually inspected the device, took notes, checked the SN, and finally agreed that it is an issue that Apple has to fix for free, as part of their own recall program.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, he said, *'your device was under warranty, covered by our program, and even covered by consumer law here in the UK'.* So he happily booked it in for a free screen replacement. All seemed too good to be true, given my past repair experience with Apple, but little I knew what was going to come next.

&amp;#x200B;

Two hours later, an email arrived from Apple MK store. It was detailing the repair and the overall total cost. I initially ignored the email thinking that the cost shown there must be for their own record. At the end of the day, I concluded, 'my screen replacement was already checked and approved; free, under warranty; as cover by their own program'.

&amp;#x200B;

However, in the back of my mind, I was still bothered by that email...*'Why was there a mention of a logic board replacement?'.* So I called the store.

&amp;#x200B;

The guy on the phone read back a part of the engineer's notes to me: *'the sensors show extensive water damage'.* Therefore, he said, *'the logic board must be replaced before they exchange the screen'*. I've politely refused the 'offer' to pay for a new logic board replacement, explaining that it must be a mistake somewhere there:

&amp;#x200B;

a) To start with, my MacBook was working fine when I dropped it off to the repair store. There was no issue with the logic board, only the screen. It was peeling off. I do not need or want a logic board replacement, just the screen cleaned, fixed, replaced, whatever they have to do so I can see better. His answer was that no matter the reason I've brought it in for, they have to replace the logic board.

&amp;#x200B;

b) Second, I said, my Macbook Pro has never been in contact with water. I take great care of my items, and my MacBook has always been in a protective enclosure, in a bag, so where does the water come from? Sadly, he couldn't tell what is damaged (as the Macbook was still working fine) or where it could have possibly come from, knowing I've never got it in contact with water. 

&amp;#x200B;

c) Third, I asked about the applicability of Consumer Law here in the UK. His reply was that ***''WATER DAMAGE' invalidates anything: Remaining warranty, Consumer Laws, etc.'*** Therefore, they won't touch the screen unless I pay to have the logic board replaced as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I refused and arranged to collect my device, and from this point on, things couldn't get stranger. After I've collected my Macbook Pro, out of curiosity, I went online trying to find more about how Apple devices get water damaged without ever being in contact with water.

&amp;#x200B;

I've discovered that what Apple calls sensor is in fact, a piece of paper (officially called Liquid Contact Indicators) that changes colour from white to red in the presence of humidity. I put emphasis on that: in the presence of moisture. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's no need for **LIQUID CONTACT, or WATER DAMAGE** to trigger the 'sensor' but just humidity, caused for example, by taking the laptop from a well-heated room outside, in the winter.

&amp;#x200B;

So took it to a local repair centre to get a quote for the screen repair, and a full diagnostic that would help me understand more about that water damage. At best, I could learn from this mistake and make sure I don't destroy any MacBooks I might buy in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later, I get a call from the repair centre with a quote and a full report. The report reads: **""In perfect working order...impeccable outside/inside...one humidity sensor triggered...no water damage...""**

&amp;#x200B;

Advised by the engineer from the independent repair centre, I decided to leave the device untouched and take Apple to court. Called the Milton Keynes Apple store, explained the findings of the independent assessor and my intention to take them to court, only to be told *""good luck'* by the store manager.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I did. Took Apple Milton Keynes store to court ([https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim](https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim)) and won. To cut the story short, it took a year and a half, lots of court fees (received them all back after I won the case - keep all receipts). There were endless email exchanges containing lots of subtle threatenings from Apple's lawyers. There were lots of dirty tactics such as switching court locations forth and back, creating and cancelling mediation appointments, missed phone calls, etc. They've tried everything you can imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

* Finally, there are some things you have to understand - Apple might/will refuse your repair under these two main excuses: out of warranty, or water damaged.

&amp;#x200B;

* However, irrespective of what they say, here's what you have to do, step by step, to win against Apple in court:

1.  Get an independent third party report. If the report findings are different from what Apple's engineers are telling you, proceeded to step two.

2. Contact Apple, talk about the independent diagnostic and ask them to compare reports. Record the calls/emails. If they refuse, proceed to step 3.

3. Go online and open a small claim court. 

Here: [https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim](https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim)

It is very straight forward; describe the issue, decided on the compensation, pay the court fee, and follow the steps.

4. Always reply to all court and Apple demands. Accept and attend all mediations. 

5. Stick with your guns. Go to court on the date with all proof/pics/call records you have. Apple diagnostic, pics, third party diagnostics, emails, receipts, even parking receipts.

6. Share your story as it unfolds here, for others to learn and get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said, ""I Took Apple To Court And Won **(Twice)** 'Water Damaged' &amp; Out of Warranty Mackbook Pro"" in my title as I am in my second court case with Apple over another MacBook Pro 2017. It is the device I've purchased as a replacement of the one above, with the peeling off screen - as decided not to touch it until the court reaches a verdict. I know, I know...why did you buy another Apple?!! Let's not get there...

&amp;#x200B;

So this new MacBook Pro 2017 refused to turn on about a month or so ago. As usual, I took it to the Apple store in MK. The diagnostic was a dead logic board, replacement ¬£500. As I've learned from my past experience with Apple, I took my MacBook out of the store, and immediately to an independent assessor.

&amp;#x200B;

Their findings were very different. A faulty 'Daughter Board Flex Cable', which was replaced for ¬£15 and the device works again now. However, the engineer from the company that did the assessment and replaced the cable has kindly explained that the problem with my MacBook is serious: Apparently, a large number of Apple Macbook Pro A1708 13 models suffer from a factory fault (logic board-SSD), and Apple has in place a new recall program, and it seems my device qualifies for that particular recall.

&amp;#x200B;

I've called Apple again, explained the situation, that my device works now without having to replace the logic board, and mentioned the recall program. This time I got in touch with a senior advisor from the US, in their attempt to avoid another court case as last time Apple lost a lot of money. I guess we all agree. Wouldn't be easier, faster, and much cheaper to replace a faulty part, especially knowing that it is correct to do so?

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the in-store manager and the US supervisor. While both sounded overly empathetic towards the issue, their answers were quite similar:

*""Sorry, we can't help. You can invoke Consumer Law, but it does not affect us as it applies only to vendors. We are a manufacturer, so it does not apply to us""*. Or, *""the recall program does not apply as your device is no longer under warranty""*. And finally, ""*if you feel you are right, do take us to court.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly enough, [the recall states clearly that it applies to all devices: ](https://support.apple.com/13-inch-macbook-pro-solid-state-drive-service)in or out of warranty, all devices are covered. I don't know if it is Apple's latest policy to mislead customers or the engineers are no longer motivated to care. Don't know what it is, but if you, Apple, don't care, why should we? See you in court, Apple, once again.

&amp;#x200B;

It is pretty much the norm to swipe up or down to access tabs, options or go back to your home screen on most phone that are out there now- we don't have or need a bar at the top of our iPhones showing we can access the control center so why is it required at the bottom of the screen?

iphone,Fell down the stairs and broke my house trying to save my iPhone,"As I was going downstairs I was scrolling through my reddit feed and slipped on a step right near the top. I didn‚Äôt fall, but when my hands shot out to catch my balance, I dropped my phone. Whenever I drop anything, I usually kick my foot out to break its fall, so this time was no different. My right foot shot out, but it was too late. Instead of breaking my phone‚Äôs fall, I kicked it straight into the wall opposite the steps. Unfortunately, as a result of watching my phone crash into the wall, I lost my footing again and slid down about ten steps, smashing my tailbone on pretty much all of them. After shouting a string of expletives, I got up and checked my phone and thankfully, it‚Äôs not broken! However, the drywall where the phone impacted the wall is. So now my butt hurts, there‚Äôs a hole in the drywall about eight feet off the ground and I scared the shit out of my dog. My phone though? Couldn‚Äôt be better! Overall, I‚Äôd say mission accomplished.
    
So if you‚Äôre looking for a case that‚Äôll survive a fall down the stairs and getting booted into a wall, the Apple Battery Case seems to do the trick.

mac,Can we please stop posting pictures of boxes and new computers?,"I hate being that guy to complain about something that seemingly a lot of other people enjoy, but I think the sheer amount of pictures of boxes and new laptops is getting out of hand.

I know how exciting it is to get a new piece of tech and want to share it with the world, but literally 8/10 of the top posts on this sub now are just pictures of boxes or new MBPs. 

I miss being able to come to this subreddit to find useful information and have meaningful discussions with people about something we all have a common interest in. This still happens from time to time, but the amount of fluff in this subreddit drowns it out.

Sorry for the rant. I‚Äôd love to hear the rest of the community‚Äôs thought as well on this matter. Thanks!",147,1340,2019-07-31,AAPL,0.03043264150619507,0.9162655472755432,0.05330178141593933
