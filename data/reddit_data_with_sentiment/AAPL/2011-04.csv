apple,I just found an iPhone on the street and I don't know how to find the owner.,"I picked it up because it was raining.  It says there is no SIM card installed, so I was wondering is there any way that I can find the owner.  I know that the phone has a serial number, do you think if I took it to the Apple store they could find the owner via the serial number?  Any other suggestions are appreciated.

Edit: Hey guys thanks for your help.  Apparently, the SIM card didn't get remotely wiped or anything, I guess it fell out of the guys backpack and came unseated in the phone.  I took it out and reset it and the guy called his phone, so he's coming to pick it up now.  Thanks agains for the help!",59,211,2011-04-01,AAPL,0.01916685700416565,0.873327910900116,0.107505202293396

iphone,Welcome to the new and improved /r/iPhone!,"Spring is here in the Northern Hemisphere and with it comes spring cleaning, so ""out with the old and in with the new,"" as they say!

IOS has gone stale everyone; the home button wasn't meant to be clicked and double-clicked so much, we still don't have widgets, and we still have those damn pop-up notifications!

It's time to face the facts, iOS is yesterday and Android is today!

I mean, Apple has pretty much admitted it, what with them [delaying the new iPhone until Fall](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/03/rumor-voice-controlled-cloud-streaming-lte-iphone-this-fall.ars).

apple,I'm 20 years old and gave my stepdad (with who I have had a rough past with) a macbook pro.,"Basically, what happened was I refurbished a macbook and he wanted it. It was a 2008 macbook A1181 and it had a lot of problems aside from the casing. I sold it to him for 500 unaware of its biggest issues being one: the computer shut off randomly and two: the LCD flickered when autoadjusting the brightness. I had tested it out but never ran into these issues because I hadn't spent a lot of time on it. I realized my best bet was to buy it back from him and sell the parts. 
The day I was supposed to pick it up from him, I was surfing craigslist and found a base model macbook pro (2010) for 550. I jumped on the deal, hoping that it wasn't beat into oblivion or something like that. I figured I could just replace the casing if need be. 
I met up with the seller on campus, surprised to find a macbook pro in perfect condition aside from a small dent. It was scratch free and clean, it looked brand new. On top of that, the box was included with UNOPENED charger, install disks, apple stickers, everything. I was pretty excited to have it for myself, and I brought it home to indulge in splurge.

Background: my stepdad has always supported macintosh products ""before it was cool."" He was 21 when he married my mom, and I was 8. She was 30. He was studying to be an engineer, and was the typical ""alternative"" 90's dude. My mom had three kids, and he had another with her shortly after (my half-sister is 11 now). After he married her, he couldn't afford a new computer so we used an old Macintosh a friend gave to him. It had power pete on it. 
Later another one of his friends gave him a really OLD apple laptop, and he was super protective of it. He brought it everywhere with him, and one day it died on him for good. He ended up getting a Dell as the times sped up and he struggled to stay in the loop. Despite the fact that four children living in a nice neighborhood were financially demanding, with my mom's student loans amounting to as much as a mortgage, he managed to get this little iPod shuffle when it first came out and he babied that thing more than his powerbook (or whatever it was). 
This all flashed before my eyes as I was browsing the macbook pro. Since I've moved out and he's been promoted obviously, times aren't nearly as tough as they had been financially. But I saw this thing the I had been coveting and got a one-opportunity deal on, and I felt compelled to pack it away and bring it to him. I was going to take this macbook away from him (his dell is VERY outdated btw) and he was going to have to go back to his old notebook. I couldn't help but feel I was doing him an injustice, and I could tell he was disappointed.


So instead of buying the macbook off of him like I planned, I traded it. I just traded it. I don't know if he understands the magnitude of what I did (which was basically give him a computer valued at 1100 for a broken macbook a1181) but it's the best feeling. And I hope he realizes that despite our rough past, despite the millions of i-hate-yous and insults, despite the scream fights and biting and him having to literally carry me to my room when I was 16, I love him and want him to have the best of everything because he worked hard, and he deserves it.

I love you, Dad.

ipad,#Procreate is now FREE for a limited time. Read why.,"Thanks to everyone who has purchased Procreate and been contacting us with your thoughts and suggestions. It’s been brilliant waking up to your constant ideas, praise and suggestions over the last 3 weeks. Today we have made a decision with Procreate, and we thought we would be open and transparent with our growing number of users.


**Fraudulent behaviour**

The App store is a marvellous place. Indy devs like Si can compete with the big boys. And we couldn’t be happier with what we’re doing. The app store also brings with it, some politics and nuances. Particularly the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in, where competing developers do some unscrupulous things in order to stay ahead.

There have been individual(s) who have been attempting to discredit Procreate, in the United States App Store. They have marked all of our great 5 star reviews as unhelpful and some have even gone to great lengths to promote other apps, whilst writing false information in reviews about Procreate. Apple thankfully, came to the rescue removing the review and have begun a full investigation.

With the release of v1.02, its unfortunately happened again. Within an hour of the update being available, we all of a sudden had 4 x 1 star ratings added to our tally and someone had marked all of our updated reviews as unhelpful once again.

In the days following this last attempt to mislead customers, our sales have taken a massive hit, to the point where we’re between a rock and a hard place. We’re a start up company of 4. No fancy VC cash or investors. As such we depend on making solid apps and day-to-day sales are vital for the long term success of Procreate.


**Procreate. Free for a limited time**

Our next step, is drastic but necessary, to try and get genuine reviews back on the store. We’re going to reduce the price of Procreate for a limited time, to free. Hopefully new customers will leave honest reviews for Procreate and we can drown-out these competing developers.

What better way to combat haters than with some love!


**Let’s tell everyone about Procreate!**

Please remember, your purchase has already helped make Procreate better. We already have some really cool free stuff headed your way soon. This is a limited time offer. So if you haven’t tried Procreate yet – now is your chance! And remember to leave a review on the iTunes store!

Let’s beat the Procreate drum and get some honest reviews going again!

You can find Procreate on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498?mt=8) and for even more info on the app, check out [our site](http://wwww.savageinteractive.com.au/Procreate/).

Cheers,
Si.

*TL;DR: Procreate is free to try and combat some suspicious circumstances. So get it now!*

**EDIT:** Whoa. Reddit is AMAZING. We woke up this morning (not so long ago, as we're in Australia) to see all of you awesome Redditors jumping on board to help us out. This really is incredible and we'd like thank every last one of you. It goes to show something great can come from something crummy. We really can't express our gratitude...

On top of the crazy response from you guys, we found Apple had also removed our most recent attack too. Obviously they acknowledged we were being targeted again, which is great news. If there are any other devs that have experienced this against you, let Apple know as they appear to listen if it's as obvious as it was against us.

Thanks again, Reddit.

**EDIT 2:** After the phenomenal response from people of Reddit and the interwebs in general, we have beaten this, surely with no chance of sabotage from here in. we will be flicking the switch back to normal price in 1 hour, so if you know anyone that would like Procreate for free, pass it on now! Cheers!

**EDIT 3:** To everyone following this, the switch had been flicked and we're back at the old price now. In the US Store we got to #4 in top free apps, and even #1 in many countries. The reviews you guys left were off the show, and we're a 5 star app, with over 130 ratings. This has well exceeded all of our expectations and we are certain that we can sustain any further attacks with this kind of buffer, should they happen.

I submitted this here because /Android tries to hide anything VERY quickly when a problem with Android is posted. It's pretty obnoxious. 


I have used both OSes for a very long time and know them quite well. I am not a fanboy of either and use both all the time. This is just what I notice. 


Android is a powerful OS that can do lots, just not that well. It constantly feels like a beta OS and it gets you addicted to future releases. The addiction comes from Android feeling so buggy that you wish the next OS that comes out will fix problems that frustrate you so much. The problem is, they never seem to arrive. Users are constantly installing custom Roms in hopes to get a ""fast one"". From my experience, they usually don't exist. I found myself addicted to installing them to get better performance but I was never happy. There was always something wrong. It was always still choppy. They are never quite *right*. Users on /Android claim their phones never lag but that statement is laughable. I have yet to use an Android phone that doesn't lag and I use them ALL. A new one comes out, I go to the store and use it for hours. I love new technology. They all lag. Android's multitasking might be better *in theory* than iOS but it's just not there yet. Apps can burn through your battery and you have no idea that they are even open. /Android usually claims it's better to GIVE THE USER CONTROL but that only works with about 10% of the population. I made a graph linked at the bottom regarding this. An Android user will absolutely love his/her phone if they come from iOS, for about a month. I have yet to come across someone (that buys a high end Android phone) to not love it in the beginning. They rave about it. They rave about the unrestricted market and how much more of *computer feel* it has. They are right. It definitely feels way better than iOS in the functionality of it. I happen to be in that 10% who would rather have the better multitasking but no way in hell do I recommend Android to any of my friends who are not like me. I have made this mistake a few times before. All I get are complaints about how slow it is, how awful the battery life is. 

Moving on from the basics. The backbutton on Android is one of the worst things I have ever seen implemented anywhere, ever. It is straight up obnoxious. You have no idea where the back button will take you. I crave the iOS option on Android. I want to hit back on the screen and know exactly where it will take me. Sometimes it exits the app, sometimes it takes you back, sometimes it does nothing, sometimes it closes the browser, sometimes it doesn't. This really needs to be improved. I literally stop using my phone when it doesn't function properly. I just put it down because I become so frustrated. 


The browser will just stop working completely. It will show nothing sometimes, or other times it will show you your home page but clicking links will not take you anywhere. If closing all your windows doesn't work (it rarely does). You have to restart. This happens pretty often to make it a pain in the ass. It has also happened on all 3 of my phones on 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, and 2.2. Great. 

Every single skin is slow as shit. My DX was an awful experience before I got LauncherPro. It was slow and laggy and very frustrating. Flipping between screens felt like the phone was struggling to display what was next. This lag continues over to parts where the launcher doesn't fix. (this is the same on all phones I have had as well) When typing, the phone will lag, then catch up with itself. Very annoying. The keyboard on many phones is even bigger than the iPhones yet it is no where near as good. 

The ""open"" crap they spew on /Android is retarded. This is actually what they tell their non-nerd friends. I'm convinced most of them over there have never had an iPhone before. They actually look for things that it does better than iOS so they can convert their friends. The jealously lasts long enough for them to buy an Android phone to be quickly disappointed at how amateur the OS feels. I have converted about 6 of my friends and my brother to Android. They all absolutely LOVED it. Slowly the complaints started rolling in. Once they began using their GF's iPhone 4s or at the store many of them regretted the switch deeply. I would say Android is better than the 3GS experience but it does not touch the iPhone 4. Not even close. I'm pretty sure /Android has no idea how sick Cydia is and what you can do with your phone. Open source hasn't really helped anyone except to try and remove the shitty lag all these phones have. There are customizations but iOS doesn't need any of that. They can all be installed from Cydia for pretty much anything you would want to do. 

The market on Android brings tears to my eyes it's so terrible. This is one thing that /Android will admit is terrible. They say there is spam on the iPhone, which is true, but it does not come close. Search for anything you want and your search fills up with pure garbage. I stopped using the Market because there is so much trash on there it's hard to find anything good. If anyone here hasn't used the market before you will laugh if you see it. Android gets so little mainstream and actually good applications that the top apps are the same ones from over a year ago. I'm not kidding. Amazon's app store is a big improvement in quality but nothing comes close to iOS, nor will it ever. Developers hate Android. 

I would have to say that the only good thing about Android coming out is having competition for Apple to improve their OS and hardware. The iPhone's screen is way too small. It's very hard to appreciate it once you move to a bigger Android screen, especially a SuperAMOLED or the DX's screen. It's just too small. Hopefully the rumors are true and Apple can make a 4"" screen in the same body style. I will switch back in a minute and never leave again. I was going to go to the iPhone 4 when it came to Verizon but I realized I would rather wait for the 5. I wasn't waiting for it either. I was just slowly building up rage for Android's sloppy experience. Even Angry Birds lags on my DX, something that would never, ever happen on iOS. The only problem with this is /Android says things like ""WELL YOU HAVE TO DO THIS AND IT WON'T LAG!"" It usually never works. But either way, I shouldn't have to do anything. I should open up a game and have it run smoothly, every single time. 

When you plug in your phone to your computer to drag files you see that Android has raped your SD card into submission. It is filled with bullshit folders and files. And I'm talking system32 filled with garbage. Why doesn't Android install this crap in ONE single folder? Why isn't there a folder for Video, Music, Pictures, and Documents. Why isn't it this simple? iOS's syncing sucks too but the way Android does it is just terrible. 

All in all, I would say /Android users have too much pride to admit that there are many things wrong with it. They praised it so much when they first got it that their pride gets in the way and can't admit they changed their minds. You will see Android users have a hard time letting people borrow their phones after the original honey moon period.

Video chat quality on ANY Android phone is pretty much unusable, even on wifi. It looks awful. On the iPhone it's near perfect. The camera is better on the iPhone than any other phone as well

Now the reason this is all Android talk is because when I use iOS I feel refreshed and smooth. It's better for 90% of all usage than Android. I feel relieved for it not to lag. It's like a little treat. 

I know this is very sloppy but I just typed this up real quick because I'm at my breaking point with Android. I have given it enough of a chance. Google needs to seriously add hardware acceleration. If this is added I would probably be on the level between Android and  iOS because of the shitty quality of the Market and the horrible back button problem. It amazes me that people are OK with their phone lagging, something they only take out when they want to take care of something quickly, yet having a computer that lags is the most frustrating thing in the world. I just can't stand that subreddit anymore and its users. Google even released 3.0 before it was ready. Talk about attention to details.

Edit: Calling me a fanboy proves my point even more. This is what Android users do. Anytime there is a problem with Android it's ""YOU ARE A RAGING FANBOY"". I am not a fanboy. I am bringing up the issues in a raging matter that Android deserves as it is not yet a quality OS. I have seen many posts in /Android about these and they get buried or the OP deletes them due to raging of users. I see complaints like this constantly in person but they always seem to not exist in Reddit user's minds. Their phones are always perfect and smooth. It's funny how /Android has posts about their battery lasting 3 days or longer. Really? So you're bragging that you don't touch your phone for 3 days? I never see iPhone posts bragging about battery life because they don't touch their phone.",367,201,2011-04-06,AAPL,0.12668096646666527,0.8439987003803253,0.029320335015654564

apple,Here is how to create an Automator app that will download the best pictures from r/Earthporn which you can use as rotating desktop wallpapers.,"Nothing super-special here, but I thought I'd share it. I trust everybody here knows about [r/Earthporn](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn) (if not, you do now!). What's better than enjoying those amazing pictures fullscreen? 

My current setup works so as to periodically (every 4 hours) download pictures from the Earthporn RSS feed, place them in a folder and use that folder as the rotating desktop backgrounds folder in OS X.  

So here's how you do it:

- Create a an Automator application, and follow [these steps](http://cl.ly/1y0u0l0G391B3k1J013f). Just notice that you have to create a **new folder** (the contents of this folder are completely deleted periodically, so I don't think you want to lose any data). Under _Get specified Finder items_ you have to put your newly created folder. The rest is self-explanatory.  
Save the Automator application and run it once.

- Open _System Preferences &gt; Desktop &amp; Screen Saver_, click on the ""+"" at the bottom of the folder list on the left, and choose the newly created folder. At the bottom of the image list, check _Change picture_ and select your time interval. 

- Open Terminal, and add a new crontab, by issuing the following command:
    crontab -e

and enter something along the lines of
    0 */4 * * * /usr/bin/open --background ""/your/full/path/to/your_automator_app.app"" &gt;&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
 
In my instance, my cron is set to run every 4 hours. More on crontab [here](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/crontab.5.html%23//apple_ref/doc/man/5/crontab).


- Enjoy.

PROTIP: If you want to hide the application icon from the dock (I prefer it to run silently), just add the following key and value in the Info.plist file found in the automator app (in order to find it you have to right-click on the automator app, and select _Show package contents_, and open the Content folder):

apple,I just bought my first Mac (mini)... Here's what I love / hate after a week with it.,"So I'm a long time Windows user (16 years) but I've installed and ran tons of versions of Linux and I'm quite comfortable with it.  I've never really had to opportunity to use or troubleshoot Macs in the wild.  I have always wanted one to just to learn the operating system.  The past year I have been trying to build a HTPC and have used Boxee on Windows, a Boxee box, and now I finally got a Mac Mini running Plex.

Coming to this OS I was able to figure somethings out pretty easily.  There are some things that really boggle me and I hope some of you can help me out in the comments.  This isn't a complaint thread but please realize that I am brand new to the OS and haven't ready any books or anything on it.

Things I love!!

==============

1) PLEX, CouchPotato, and Sabnzbd

2) The bluetooth keyboard and Trackpad!  The gestures are amazing.

3) Looks awesome on my Plasma via HDMI.

4) The look.  Non-intrusive and everyone goes ""wow, what is that?""

5) OSX is gorgeous.  The little things you can do in it are awesome.

6) Automagic!  Everything I've plugged into it just works.

7)  Installing Applications.  Copy ""This"" to ""Apps""!  I'm looking at you Windows and especially YOU, Linux!!


Now, things that piss me off (read: not use to yet)

===============================

1) Why can I hide the dock but not the bar at the top?

2) Why can't I make a window go ""full screen"" or at least use the remaining area of the screen without manually stretching it out ONLY on the bottom right of the screen?

3) WhyTF can I not Cut/Paste between drives?

4) How the hell do I select / invert selection in Finder?

5) Finder, Y U NO B Icon like that Apple button on the top left?

These are mostly just little nuances that I need to Google / read up on.  If anyone out there is looking to buy a Mac product I would definitely suggest checking out the Macs.  I can tell that the Mini is kind of under powered but it is doing what I ask it to do and that's fine with me.  I really liked the list you guys posted under the subreddit title.  I would love to see regular updates made to it.  Thanks for reading my little rant.  I'm glad to be part of the community now :)

apple,So who else here is a Safari fan?,"Safari gets a lot of crap here on Reddit, and I was just wondering who here uses it.

I personally use it and I don't really see anything wrong with it. It's a really great browser (it's not really missing any features I really need, and it runs nice).

Sure, it kinda sucks out of the box, but like all other browsers, the extensions make it better. One of my personal favorites is YouTube5 - basically, it replaces YouTube's crappy Flash video player with Safari's native HTML5 video player, which is so much of an improvement I actually won't watch YouTube videos under my Windows partition anymore. (My MacBook Pro can actually watch YouTube videos in HD fullscreen using YouTube5 without turning on the discrete graphics card.)

I'd use Chrome, but the UI just doesn't really do it for me, and plus it has a nasty habit of turning on my MBP's discrete graphics card at the slightest provocation and not letting go. I don't really see what the big deal is, really.

So who else is a fan of That Browser?",101,110,2011-04-09,AAPL,0.073944091796875,0.8966454863548279,0.02941049262881279

iphone,Questions about the iPhone and iOS from a current user of Android (not trolling),"First off, just to restate, not trolling, not trying to make an Android vs iOS topic or anything like that.  Second, sorry for how stupid long this post is.

I am thinking about switching back to iOS when the iPhone 5 comes out.  The thing is the last time I used iOS or an iPhone was with my iPhone 3G in 2009 and obviously a lot has changed and I have solidified how I use a smartphone. So I need to get some information on certain app equivalents and how some things work in iOS

First the main apps I use on my current phone are:

* Gmail
* Chrome to Phone (can send a link from desktop Chrome or Firefox to my phone)
* 2Cloud (same thing in the opposite direction)
* Google Voice
* Google Maps Navigation
* Pocket (cool wallet type program where you can enter stuff like your insurance info, computer logins, have it encrypted and synched via Dropbox so you can access it on any phone)
* BeyondPod (Podcast program that downloads podcasts on schedule for me and can manage them without me needing to connect to a PC)

Are there any equivalents of these on iOS?  For Gmail I'm not worried since Google has Exchange ActiveSync and I know that there are pay GPS apps as good or better than Navigation so I'm not worried about that.

My main hesitance with the iPhone is its reliance on iTunes and having to tether to add anything to my phone. I know a lot of people consider iTunes a positive when it comes to the iPhone but I remember absolutely hating iTunes with my iPhone 3G.  It synched slow and since I couldn't download podcasts over the air I had to sync it every day.  I rarely add music to my phone so if it wasn't for my podcasts and audiobooks I wouldn't to connect to iTunes more than once a week or so for backup.  Has this situation got better?  Is the synching at least faster or can I now download a file larger than 10MB OTA from the iTunes app on the phone (IIRC that was the limit unless you were on Wi-Fi)

My last question is battery life. From what I've read the battery life especially on the iPhone 4 is great and knowing Apple it will be as good or better on the iPhone 5.  I just want to know what type of battery life I could expect. I know everyone's usuage is different depending on what they do so it may be hard to tell. But has anyone done any tests like browse the web constantly until the battery dies or loop a video until the battery dies?  What can I expect from that battery life wise?

Thanks in advance for any advice or help.",66,36,2011-04-09,AAPL,0.04393228888511658,0.9222415089607239,0.03382624685764313

[Marple](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marple/id288689440?mt=8) - A great logic puzzler. If you like a game that makes you think, you will love this game.

You are presented a 5x4 set of tiles, each containing 5 letters, numbers or shapes. You are given a set of clues, and then determine which letter, number or shape is on a particular tile.

[Zombie Highway](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zombie-highway/id376412160?mt=8) - Very fun game. You drive down a highway in your SUV and prevent zombies from tipping your car by shooting them or running them into other cars and trucks.

[Helsing's Fire](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helsings-fire/id380290526?mt=8) - Another good puzzler. Aim your torch to illuminate different types (i.e. colors) of monsters, then select the appropriate potion to wipe them out. If you like puzzlers, you will like this game.


[No, Human](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/no-human/id387624835?mt=8) - This is a physics based puzzle game. You play as ""The Universe"" and hurl flaming rocks at human spaceships, playing with some outer-space forces.

[Pig Rush](http://pigrush.reigndesign.com/) - A kids game in disguise, this one just makes me laugh. They have bloated it up a bit, but it's still a funny and casual run-as-far-as-you-can-game a la Canabalt and others.

[Boost 3D](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boost-3d/id333191476?mt=8) - Race as far as you can along a shape-changing tunnel and dodge obstacles. Very cool graphics and addicting.

[Monospace](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monospace/id302367044?mt=8) - A unique puzzler game in which you switch between 2 and 3 dimensional views to collect a certain amount of squares.

[Sneezies](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sneezies/id298155609?mt=8) - Another kids game in disguise. Set of a chain reaction of sneezes to release the Sneezies, who are trapped inside a bubble.

iphone,I just un-jailbroke my phone and I recommend it,"First some back story. I have an iPhone 4 on AT&amp;T. It's my 5th iPhone and I love everything about it. When I got my first iPhone, it was the 3G and I have *always* jailbroken them as soon as I could.

The other day, I decided to just upgrade to the newest iOS and see how long I could live without jailbreaking. So far, so good. My phone is literally at least twice as fast now. The battery life is nearly double.

Of course there are many little things I miss (Quick Reply in BiteSMS, Safari Download Manager with iFile, not to mention all my pirated apps). It's been a few days and the benefits outweigh jailbreaking for me completely -- but do you want to know what I miss the most?

**Custom text message ringtones**. I'm not joking. I actually didn't use most of my 157 apps I had installed (I have 33 now). Everything else I honestly don't mind. It's just the fact that my phone makes the same sound for every single text message. It ""forces"" me to look at my phone every time it tri-tones.

I'm sure Apple will add this eventually, I just really hope it's soon.

ipad,Please convince this grad student to get an iPad,"I've been struggling with this for a while. I want a tablet that I can incorporate into my academic workflow. I also want one that has fun and games. With Netflix and Mendeley on the iPad I've been struggling to find a reason to not get one. I primarily want the tablet so I can take my readings with me on the go and lay down and read, which is hard to accomplish with a laptop or a netbook. I also want it for fun and games and the iPad just seems to have a lot more of those.

My academic workflow essentially goes like this: Read journal article (PDF file) &gt; Annotate article &gt; summarize article in separate document &gt; assemble articles for a topic in Mendeley.

I had a Nook Color for a while, but UI lag gets to me and I eventually sold it off expecting to either get an iPad or an ASUS Transformer. On that I used RepliGo Reader to read and annotate and my Nook's involvement generally ended there. Looking at articles like http://culturalbyt.es/post/1125482840/workflow it just seems like the iPad is far friendlier to an academic workflow, though.

The ASUS Transformer's keyboard option sold me for a while, but I can just get a similar case for the iPad. I lose out on battery life, but gain in a lot of existing features. I posted this in /r/Android, but it doesn't seem fair to just get their opinion. Are there any academics out there that love their iPad? Is there anything else to convince me to get in Apple's camp?

ipad,Weekend Review: ASUS Eee Slate vs. iPad1,"I've been an iPad1 owner for 6 to 8 months now, however this weekend I was asked to ""road-test"" an ASUS Eee Slate (EP121). In order to gather my thoughts/observations, I thought I'd wrap it all up into a mini-review and let you guys comment/ask questions. So here goes:…. 

**Device Specs &amp; Hardware**

Instead of typing out all the relative specs,.. I'll just link to the [ASUS](http://www.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Slate_EP121/#specifications) site and [Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/IPad#Technical_specifications), and go on to comment on hardware distinctions that caught my eye. The ASUS comes in around 2.5lbs and iPad1 at 1.5lbs. I didn't expect this to make much of a difference but it really does. (If I had an iPad2.. I think it would be even more dramatic). Having a 3G option on the iPad is nice,.. no such (native) option for the Asus. (You'd have to find a 3rd party like a MiFi or HotSpot type puck) 

With regard to ports around the edge (ASUS) really kinda ruins the aspect of portability. (IE = if you plug lots of things in, you might as well have a laptop). The USB doors feel cheap and breakable. The buttons for POWER, On-Screen-Keyboard and Orientation-Lock are all in close proximity, which seems counter-intuitive to me (You have to look to make sure you don't accidentally hit the wrong one,.. but if you have lots of peripherals plugged in, it's hard to raise/look.) 


**Performance, Battery life &amp; Usability**

    ASUS from COLD OFF to Login Screen = 37 seconds
    From login to functional desktop = roughly same 37 to 40 seconds
    From Desktop to full shutdown = about 15seconds

    iPad from OFF to Passcode = 30seconds
    From Passcode to functional desktop = 1 or 2 seconds ?
    From Desktop to full shutdown = 23 seconds

Considering the ASUS also uses an SSD, I expected fairly snappy performance, but there was frequent lag / screen redrawing,etc. System Restore was turned OFF and I tried setting everything to ""Performance"" which helped a little,.. but that caused problems in usability (""Classic Theme"" means GUI elements are smaller/harder to touch/manipulate). Personally I think Windows makes a horrible tablet OS,. .and my experience testing reinforces this. GUI elements are hard to manipulate. Sometimes took me 4 or 5 touches to grab/resize a window,etc. Touch-responses are inconsistent from one part of OS to another (example: you can touch-scroll up/down a webpage, but NOT through the Start Menu?). On-screen keyboard had some quirky behavior (Example: typing in 1 box and touching next input box causes keyboard to disappear). Testing with the stylus was a little better,..but still felt like flying a biplane in the age of rocketships. I am honestly stumped why Microsoft keeps trying to shoehorn a windowing-OS onto a Tablet. They'd be much better off using WP7 or creating a dedicated tablet OS. 

I had some strange unpredictable weirdness with the Intel HD video. Trying to maximize a YouTube video caused a blank/black screen (could hear audio just fine, but no video). Minimizing and then maximizing fixed it,.. but when video ended and dropped back to desktop my wallpaper had strange grey diagonal stripes through it. At another time, the system seemed to lock-up and cast a grey tone over the entire screen. (had to press-hold POWER button to shut OFF and reboot to fix). My aluminum unibody Mac Mini plays Minecraft (low-settings) just fine, so considering the ASUS EP121 was same or better specs, I figured I'd test Minecraft on it. Also set to lowest graphics settings, it was playable, but it wasn't really an enjoyable experience. 

* ASUS = 34Wh battery (3 to 4 hours use doing normal stuff (multi-tasking between email, documents, web-browsing, short videos, music, etc) 

* iPad = 26Wh battery (8 to 10 hours use doing same as above) 



**Apps and other Functionality**

Using the ASUS/Windows combination really reinforced to me how much Apple's ecosystem emphasizes the importance of Apps. On an iPad, there's nothing between you and the Apps. You just touch, and it's there. Also.. the Apps seem tailor-fit for iOS (no surprise really) … but the Apps on a Windows system were never really intended to be tablet-based, which leaves them feeling very ill-fitting. (like wearing the wrong clothes to the wrong event). While there has been some skepticism regarding business-apps on iPad, I browsed the App Store's ""Business"" category and found a variety of well-known business use Apps such as: Webex, VMware View and Citrix Receiver, Cisco AnyConnect VPN and a variety of apps from Mcafee. Even apps like AutocadWS. 

I tested a variety of things like VPN access and Remote Desktop. While both units were capable of doing these things, the iPad seemed much easier/faster to reach my goal. 

I'm not sure what the solution is on the ASUS for lost/theft. On the iPad I've enabled ""Find My iPhone"" for tracking/messages/remote-wipe. (which we can also do through Outlook Web Access). I suppose on the ASUS you could encrypt the drive with BitLocker.. which would protect your data but not help you get your unit back. 

Benefit to the iPad that you can do a factory system restore pretty quickly, and redownload all your Apps from the App Store. If the ASUS tablet is similar to our other Windows desktops, we can pull a clean image down in about an hour and then maybe another hour to customize (rejoin domain, reconnect to Antivirus server, Log User in to create profile and tweak personalization such as Printers,etc) 

I think that's about it.. you guys will remind me of stuff I forgot ;P",13,25,2011-04-17,AAPL,0.049275822937488556,0.9168865978717804,0.03383754380047321

However I was just playing around with it and I Bluetooth paired the iPad to my iPhone (both not jailbroken). Straight away the Personal Hotspot alert came up on my phone and a new icon appeared in the top left of the iPad. Sure enough my iPad was online and that's now how I'm writing this note.

**UPDATE:** Okay, here's what happened. He had a missed call last night after I fell asleep, and I left her a voicemail (Using the hold the home button method.) I left my number and while I was waiting, another guy called me and I told him the story. He said he'd track the guy down and get him in touch with me. 

As the first girl called me back, someone knocked on her door and it was the guy that I spoke to on the phone. He let them know what happened and they let HIM know that I was on the phone as they spoke.

He thanked me a ton of caring enough to go through the trouble of how to work the phone when it's locked and said he has to have it locked because there are work e-mails on the phone and they make him lock it. 

He said he'll swing by my work and grab it from me some time today. I have to say it feels good to help somebody like this when I didn't ""have to do the Macguyver shit"" and could have just taken it to the ATT store. Who knows how long the process would be for ATT to get him a new phone and shit. Especially with a holiday tomorrow. So for a total of an our worth of ""work"" on my part, he'll get his phone much sooner and not have to worry about reloading all of the data, contacts, apps, etc.

ipad,Apps for an 87 year old.,"I recently picked up my iPad 2 from london and I'm loving it.

My grandmother and her ex-bf (family friend) came over yesterday for a pre-Easter  meal - both are quite old. The family friend is the older of the two (87) and gets completely fascinated with technologies we show him - especially google maps! 

I decided to bring down my iPad and showed him google earth. He even had a go on it. He was enthralled - really amazed by it. 

He ended up saying that he'll pay for one if I get it and set it up for him. He doesn't need too much power graphics wise so I figure getting the first iPad would be enough for him.

So what I'm asking is, what apps are out there for the older generation? Anything really simple to use. (this is a must)

Not sure how many people this applies to, but it has always bothered me that opening documents on my Uni's Blackboard site doesn't work on iOS. It shows the document but it cant be manipulated/opened/saved. So I would have to download anything from Blackboard on my computer before I left my house. It always limited the usefulness of my iPad at uni.

I made a tiny bookmarklet that extracts the document from the webpage and opens it in a new tab ready to be sent to another app like GoodReader, Dropbox or any other supported app.

Let me know if you want it. Again, not sure if anyone cares but I thought I'd share.

edit: Just made a tumblr for the instructions [link](http://iostricks.tumblr.com/post/5035540205/blackboard-webct-document-extraction-bookmarklet)

edit 2: let me clarify, I've tried every workaround in the books. No matter what I tried nothing would open the document so I could use it properly. Not iCab, not holding the link, not trying to open in a new page, nothing. It must be my version of Blackboard/WebCT. So I just coded a little thing to extract the document - now it works.",11,38,2011-04-29,AAPL,0.03223997727036476,0.937237560749054,0.030522417277097702

iphone,Can iPhone 4 use Bluetooth headphones for music?,"I got an iPhone 4 and haven't been able to get it to play music over my Bluetooth headphones. They pair up and work fine for calls, but music apps just play the audio through the iPhone speakers. The headphones can control playback (AVRCP). I thought iPhone supported A2DP now. Is it intentionally hamstrung? Am I doing something wrong? Thanks for your help.

UPDATE: I kept re-pairing and forgetting the device and eventually it paired up and started working. Looks like it wasn't pairing as headphones. Thanks for your help!",23,20,2011-04-30,AAPL,0.3462405204772949,0.6158020496368408,0.03795744478702545
