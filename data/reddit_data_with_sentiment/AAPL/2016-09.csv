apple,"So I got to experience Apple's customer service (in Sweden) first hand, after reading all the online stories","I was on vacation and had my iPhone 6S 64GB in my pocket. Forgot about that and jumped in the pool. When I got up I started looking for my iPhone, and couldn't find it. Checked if I forgon it at the pool bar. Nope. Panic starts to set. Thought crosses my mind, and I look into the pool and see a blurry black square at the bottom of the pool. Dive in and retrieve it. It's still on and running. I shut it down, and dry it off as well as I can, and then set it in the warm sunlight to dry off some more. 24 hours later I try to turn it on, but it's dead. Plug it in, but in seconds it gets *really* hot. Unplug. Still dead. Damn. 

Call insurance company. They sey 'call Apple for repairs/replacement'. The insurance company will pay for it except the $150 deductible. So I call Apple and tell them what's going on. 

So I get a link by email from Apple where I can set up my credit card payment (this is done beforehand), and then UPS will come pick up my phone. Then, when they have analyzed it, if they can repair it, they'll let me know what the cost will be, and I can choose how to proceed.

Except they never contact me about my iPhone. 

Apple just sends me a replacement phone and charges me more than $1000. More than a brand new phone costs at my local store (Swedish prices). Daphuq Apple!? This is just a replament phone! Not even a brand new in an unopened box, with new warranty and stuff. 

So I call Apple and explain. My call gets redirected to at least three different AppleCare guys and their bosses(?). Finally 3 days later, this guy calls from Apple and says: 'hey we charged you the wrong amount; way too much. We're so sorry, we don't know what happended. Hey you can keep you new phone and we'll give you back *all* your money, you don't have to pay *anything*. This one is on us. Is that ok for you?""

Well it sure is. Thank guys.

**TL;DR** Apple replaced my 11 month old iPhone 6S 64GB for free after I ruined it by swimming with it in a pool.",35,135,2016-09-02,AAPL,0.06126070022583008,0.906352698802948,0.032386526465415955

apple,"Appreciation: Apple iPad Pro 9.7"" as a computer","With everyone waiting for new Macs and iPhones this year, I just wanted to show my appreciation for using the iPad Pro as a computer. 

I recently upgraded to  the Cellular 128GB iPad Pro 9.7 in Gold from Apple from a 32GB model. The first time, I didn't consider the keyboard or Pencil. But since my job was reimbursing me for this, I figured why not. What i did not expect was to be blown away by the experience. 

**Smart Keyboard**:

The Apple Smart Keyboard is... different. The keys themselves are shallow and cramped at first, but you quickly get used to the feeling. For reference, I can type 120 wpm without errors and with the Keyboard I can type around 70 wpm after some practice. The material feels like textured plastic or somewhat like Kevlar or carbon fiber. It loves to trap crumbs and dust between keys, so cleaning is must, but since it's water resistant, I just dampen a cloth and keep it moving. 

**Apple Pencil**: 

I wouldn't consider the Apple Pencil *necessary* when getting the Pro, but if you can get it, it's great to have. Personally, I like using as a mouse and browsing full desktop sites and writing handwritten notes. As a stylus, it's well built and weighty, but the white plastic is very slippery, and I wish it could physically put it inside the iPad. I like the pressure sensitivity when writing for putting emphasis on info I to remember. But, I don't feel as though Apple implements the Pencil well in their OS. I wish I could do something like Samsung, where I could write and the OS converts it to text instead of using the Pencil to tap-write (?) on the keyboard. 

**Software**: 

I know this won't apply to everyone, but the iPad Pro could seriously be a computer replacement (or at least supplement). For starters, I has excellent battery life. It probably charge it every two days (with heavy use). The Microsoft Suite for iPads is very good. Word and PowerPoint pretty much retain all of there desktop features, with Excel missing some formula power. I will say that apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premier Pro really should be updated to take advantage of the graphics - but this is a common occurrence across a lot of apps. 

For those wanting a file system, I use 2 apps called ""Remote File Manager Free"" and ""Wake On LAN ($0.99) on the App Store, with my AirPort Extreme and rMBP. The rMBP sits at home now in sleep mode connected via Ethernet to the Extreme. When I want to access a file I wake it up remotely using the WOL app, then access the computer as a drive in the file manager app. Occasionally, I'll need to actually see the computer screen, and for that I use the Chrome Remote Desktop app.

[Handwritten Notes](http://imgur.com/a/Xucax)

TL;DR- Depending on your work, the iPad Pro could be a computer with the right combo of software and accessories.

apple,I miss how iOS 9 Now Playing tab's swipe down was 'dynamic' and hate how it is now a 'gesture' in iOS 10 :(,"Apple has changed a lot of its UX from a gesture to dynamic. And what I mean by that is let's say you do a 5 finger pinch, nothing would happen until after you do the gesture. But if it was dynamic, you could see the process taking place while you do the 5 finger pinch. You could easily go back and forth, similar to that of launchpad pad on the trackpad for Macs.

During OS X Lion, getting into launchpad was just a gesture but in Mountain Lion, it was changed to dynamic. And it just feels so natural.

And that's what's my only problem with Apple Music. The now playing tab isn't dynamic anymore. And it irks me. Sometimes I just wanna peak a glimpse of what's behind it.

apple,"Apple didn't make the iPhone 7 thinner, and they improved battery life. This is exactly what everyone has been asking for and no one is talking about it!","Before every iPhone release, all everyone talks about is how all they want in an iPhone is better battery life, and we finally got it! Granted, it's only 1-3 extra hours (depending on how you use it), but to me that's significant, especially when you consider the impressive performance improvements.

BTW, they also improved the front facing camera, improved the back facing camera (a lot), added a faster LTE radio, added stereo speakers,added water resistance, added dust resistance, added sleek new colors, improved the antenna design, doubled the storage, improved the display, and more, again all while improving battery life and graphic and CPU performance (a lot).  Not a bad upgrade in my opinion.  I do completely understand why losing the headphone jack is frustrating for a lot of people, but for me and a lot of other people who have already been using Bluetooth headphones, this is a non issue.

EDIT: Since a lot of people are throwing this out there, I'll just add that I am in no way saying getting rid of the headphone jack was a good idea, in fact for most people this completely sucks.  All I'm saying is that for those people who don't mind the sacrifices you have to make w/ Bluetooth (shittier sound quality/something else to charge...), the iPhone 7 is a great update.

Any song that is NOT downloaded and also NOT licensed gets completely removed. (I had a playlist for ""On deck"" songs that I like but didn't want to add to my library yet, and that list was completely wiped out)

apple,Apple should include a video explaining all the features of the new iOS when it's being installed.,"I'm always wondering why Apple doesn't do this.

People around me simply weren't aware of the most basic new functions of the OS and therefore didn't really use them or slowly discovered how they work and what they do.

Apple should include a short (skipable) video after a new iOS has been installed that goes through all the new features, maybe even a few tutorial messages that are natively in the OS while you use it. The tips app just doesn't do a good job at this at all.

apple,iPhone 7 - first thoughts from iPhone 6 owner,"I just got my iPhone 7 in the mail, and here are my first few thoughts after an hour of usage.


I have been using the iPhone 6 for the past 2 years, as I usually go with a 2-year cycle. I kinda felt bad about the headphone jack thing at first, but we will see in the future how it works out. I will put one adapter in the car (or will upgrade to a Bluetooth dongle, not sure yet) and will get and an additional one for the wallet. Not the best solution just yet, I gotta admit that, but it feels like something I can live with. 


From an iPhone 6 switcher’s perspective I am getting:


- faster processor and all that stuff
- the motion co-processor (raise to wake, hey Siri)
- faster Touch ID
- two vastly better cameras (especially the front shooter seems to be a HUGE upgrade)
- stereo speakers (more on that later)
- 3D Touch (also a big plus)
- a slightly better screen (better colors, contrast… no OLED though)
- the Taptic engine (haptic feedback and vibration feel soo much better)
- a new home button (which is likely the biggest change in terms of feel)

This is just from the top of my mind and changes that strike immediately.
First of all, the phone flys, blabla, we talked about that quite a lot already, so I am going to skip that.


**Home button, Touch ID, Taptic Engine**. The things that really improve the experience by quite a lot is the new Touch ID paired with the new home button (and the Taptic engine). A well-rounded package that complements each other quite nicely. I unlock my phone a billion times a day. That got quite a lot faster. Big change for me. Also, the non-moving home button feels a lot more robust… The feedback you get from the taptic engine feels really good, I like pressing it. We will see how that works over time, especially after the honeymoon period is over.

**3D touch**. Has gotten a reasonably nice idea with it’s better implementation in iOS 10. Starting Music, doing simple tasks (as going straight to calling someone right from the home screen) are not all that impressing but improves usability and is, in my opinion, quite a QOL improvement. Again, we will see if I keep using it, but feels like a solid upgrade for now.


**The Stereo speakers**. Well, you may have read that the earpiece is a little less loud than the bottom blaster. That is true, but given that I have my phone held in portrait 90% of the time, the second speaker also adds a lot more room? to the sound?. Not really sure how to describe it, but as the earpiece is front facing, sounds and things like Siri work a lot better now. Also the phone “vibrating” as sort of a subwoofer is a nice idea.


**Cameras**. The back shooter has an insane dynamic range as compared to the 6 cameras. Really dig it. Will have to see how it keeps up in real life scenarios. I am super excited for the possibility to shoot RAW. I take a lot of pictures and I am familiar with DSLR and editing RAW and all that kind of stuff, so this is a welcome upgrade for me as well.
The front camera is what impressed me a lot as well. It is SO much more detailed and has a much better performance in low light and also a much better dynamic range. Not the biggest selfie guy, but I take some from time to time. Don’t judge.


Many of the changes I talked about have been implemented in the 6s already, I know that. I just want to give a perspective from an iPhone 6 owner. The upgrade makes quite a lot of difference, even if the exterior of the phone hasn’t changed all that much. I do like that fact. I like to stay under the radar in public.

apple,My opinions on the iPhone 7 as a Nexus 6P/Android convert,"So, I've never used an iPhone before, I've always been an Android guy. I had both an iPad 2 and iPad 4, but never a phone or laptop. Recently for college I got a Macbook, and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the hardware, and the beautiful design of it. Still not sure on OSX, but that's another discussion.

Anyhow, I was getting bored of Android. Now, I love it. I love Android and my old 6P, but I wanted something different, and maybe a smaller device too. Since I already had a Macbook, the iPhone 7 had me extremely interested. Of course, many comparisons will be drawn between the iPhone and Nexus. I pre-ordered one a couple days before launch. 128gb Gold, same color as my Macbook. Without further ado, here are my thoughts.

**Build**

Damn, Apple. This is where no Android manufacturer I've used can compete. It's absolutely beautiful looking, feels incredibly sleek and sturdy in hand, and just has a general high quality and well thought out feel to it. A+, through and through.

**Buttons**

This seems like a pointless category, but it's noteworthy enough for me to mention it. Holy *hell* are they firm and tactile! In an absolutely good way. The buttons on my 6P were a lot weaker and easier to press. Some may prefer that, but it led to the power button being bumped quite often and my phone turning on in my pocket etc.

In the same category, the home button. I'm not sure if I prefer it over the on-screen buttons with Android, but the taptic engine is absolutely wonderful. If you told me that it was actually clicking, I would totally believe it, just as with my MB.

Also, THANK YOU Apple, for the mute switch. I never realized how much I would actually use it, but it's a lot.

**Screen**

This is interesting, as it's a different technology to the 6P. As some may know, the 6P is AMOLED, and it has an extremely beautiful panel in my opinion. While the iPhone can't match the nice saturation and the black pixels actually being off, it's definitely a beautiful display. I had a lot of concern over the tiny resolution (Especially on a modern phone!) but I don't even notice it, honestly.

**Speakers**

6P wins here. No doubt. It absolutely demolishes the iPhone. Now, that isn't to say the iPhone has bad speakers, but they just can't match dual high quality front facing speakers. The speakers in the iPhone are good enough though, plenty for watching Youtube and Netflix. Much better than a single downward or backward firing speaker.  I'm so glad Apple decided to add it, as I think this was the point that pushed me over to ""Alright, I'll give Apple a go"".

**Camera**

Again, another interesting category. The Nexus 6P has a pretty good camera, in my opinion. Not quite top notch, but I'd put it up there with the better smartphone cameras for sure. I have to say, the iPhone has beaten it so far in my limited testing. I'm not a huge picture taker, but the pictures I have taken [(All featuring my dog, naturally!)](https://imgur.com/a/auJtJ) have turned out nicely. It also seems to perform a little better in low light, but I've not been able to test it much. As for the front facing camera, it seems lacking in lower light, but I rarely take selfies so don't take my word for that.

**Ports**

Point of contention here. I think it is for most of us. I have two complaints about this, at the moment. First of all, the headphone jack. Yeah, yeah, we've all heard the complaints, but I'd simply like to comment on something. I see some people using the ""Well, Apple changed the old 30 pin port and we all got used to that!""

This is different. The 30 pin port was exclusive to Apple, and as such when Apple moved, there wouldn't be any lingerers with it. The 3.5mm jack, however, is a staple of the audio industry. Nearly every other audio device uses 3.5mm, which is the problem. It's always been a universal port.

Second point, the lightning port. I wish this was USB Type C. First, standardization. Moving it to the same port that everyone else will be using would be wonderful.

Second.. The Macbook uses it. As it stands, I can't have headphones/earbuds that will work with both my phone and my laptop without an adapter for one of them. Now THAT is stupid. Sorry Apple, you lost me there. At least keep things consistent within your product lines. Both Lightning and Type C are great, but I'd really prefer just sticking to one.

**Software**

My experience here is fairly limited since I've only had it since yesterday, and I haven't used iOS in a good 4 years or so (and never on an iPhone), but I'll give my thoughts on it. This will likely be more rambling than the sections about hardware above. I'd probably just skip this part if you've already used iOS.

So, as said, I was an Android guy ever since I got my first smartphone (an LG Esteem). 

The software feels.. polished for the most part. It's incredibly fluid and quick. Even smoother than Nougat on my 6P, which is expected due to how Android has to work. It still surprised me though. I like the design too. I'm not sure whether I prefer Material design or iOS, but I can safely say they're both beautiful looking in their own right.

I'm not really sure where to start digging in, so I guess I'll just go into things that I don't like as much and ramble about those.

First, the keyboard. I feel it's a step back from Google's. The prediction/autocorrection isn't near where Google's is, and the layout feels slightly less efficient. Granted, I'll be much quicker with it when I get used to the layout, but I felt it worth mentioning.

Second, the settings menu. It needs to be categorized better. As it stands, it's like an endless list of stuff. It just doesn't seem as well thought out as the rest of the OS.

Third, multitasking. The multitasking menu is fine for the most part, my complaint is about the home screen there though. Why is the home screen on the multitasking menu? If I wanted to go to the home screen, I thought that's what the home button is for..? It takes up space needlessly, as far as I can really tell. Otherwise, multitasking has been great, this just struck me as weird.

Fourth, the control center. I think Android implements this better in the notification shade, rather than an entirely different menu in iOS. I can see the argument for having it in a separate menu, but I think Android just has it a bit more streamlined there.

I guess that really covers my complaints. Overall, I like iOS so far. It's new and scary and confusing, but I'm sure I'll grow more accustomed to it over time and like it even more.

As for things to praise, I haven't used it enough to say confidently that something is miles better, except...

Battery. Holy battery, Batman! And not the aggressive kind!

Even with Doze on Android now, the iPhone seems to keep better battery yet when not in use. Same story goes for being in use, as it's had higher battery percentage at various points in the day than my 6P has had. Granted, my normal workflow is all screwy now because I'm on a new OS and all, so it's hardly scientific, but I think it's much better still.

So, to sum up my thoughts very quickly: The Hardware on the iPhone 7 is fantastic. Build and everything is beautiful. Speakers aren't as good as a 6P, but they're still pretty damn good. I miss my earbuds though. Software is nice, but I also have a few hangups there, however I'm sure I'll get over those as time goes on.

If you also have a Nexus 6P and you're thinking about jumping ship, I'd say the iPhone 7 is an excellent point to jump over, though I'd recommend waiting to see what the Pixel phones are like, of course.

* Both the adapter and Lightning EarPods has what appears to be a combination ADC/DAC/amp on the lightning side of the connector
* The connectors has a layer of plastic, a metal shield, another layer of plastic, and at least in the EarPods, also glue/adhesive over the DAC chip.  One can only speculate, but this amount of material around the board is for both mechanical protection, and for protection against humidity.
* The chip is not marked with a manufacturer, but bears the marking ""338S00140"" - judging by the teardown of the phones themselves, this is likely a custom-made-for Apple chip by a third party.  Possibly Cirrus Logic or Dialog Semiconductor - both manufacturers have products that fit the bill in terms of specifications.  
* Dialog has products whose Dynamic range figures closely match what the 100 dBA dynamic range measured for the adapter, but this is pure speculation
* The chip in the EarPods and adapter, while bearing the same identifier are variants of each other.

apple,Extremely low light shots on my iPhone 7,"EDIT: for my pedantic Reddit friends out there, I realized I had made a slight mistake in the title shortly after I posted this. Two or three photos were taken in extreme low light, the rest are just low light night shots. Do manage your expectations. And yes, it's GB for gigabyte, not gb. Lol. 

I posted this on the sticky megathread but I guess it'd probably be buried anyway so I decided to post it here.

Anyway, I got my iPhone 7 Black 128gb yesterday and I couldn't have been more excited putting the new camera through its paces! 

Coincidentally, the annual Singapore Grand Prix ended 2 days ago. It is the first and original night race in the F1 history, boasting a street circuit criss-crossing the fantastic city skyline.

Since the race takes part in the heart of city center, teardown process afterwards has to happen very quickly. Here are some photos of the teardown process taken on Tuesday night on my newly acquired iPhone 7!

apple,TIL: Deactivating an Apple Device Cancels Apple Pay Pre-Authorized Transactions Made With That Device.,"I got a call from Apple today regarding my online Apple Watch pre-order that I placed on Sept 9 and paid for using Apple Pay on my iPhone 6. They told me the transaction wasn't approved which I thought was odd since I remember seeing the pre-authorized transaction in the AMEX app, and I had to give them the card number so that they could approve it the old fashioned way.

Anyhow, after calling AMEX they explained that the charge was refused because the device I had used to approve the transaction was deactivated. I had sold my iPhone 6 last week and got a 7 to replace it, and as a result the pre-authorized transactions made on the 6 were revoked.

This obviously makes sense when you think about it, but it's one of those things you probably don't really think about in general. You put your finger on the home button, wait for confirmation, and then wait for UPS to show up, that's typically about it.

So, just an FYI for anyone who might not give this a lot of thought (like me). If you're frantically trying to pre-order the next hot Apple gadget at 3:00 am and use Apple Pay to pay for it, make sure you're not approving the transaction on a device that you plan to decommission before you receive the new one. Keep in mind, this is only for pre-authorized transactions, so it's really only something you'd run into if you're pre-ordering something that won't actually be charged to your account until some point down the road.

TL;DR Don't use an Apple device you plan to decommission tomorrow to pre-authorize Apple Pay for stuff that won't ship for weeks.

**Edit: Apparently this is an ongoing issue with Apple Pay pre-orders that were placed using AMEX cards, according to [iPhone in Canada](http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/iphone-7-apple-pay-not-charged/), so it might just be that there was a complication between Apple and AMEX and that this had nothing to do with me erasing the device I used to place the order. Hard to say really. Apple didn't seem to have an explanation for me when they called, aside from saying the charge was declined, and it was AMEX who told me it was due to the device no longer being active.

apple,I got Windows 10 Running on a SD Card on my Macbook.,"So. Like many OS X users, we love OS X, but there's that 1 app that we have to use for either work/entertainment/etc that makes us go back to Windows. For me, I need Windows for my Visual Studio App Testing Dev Environment. Some like me, who don't like having to share the OS X with the Windows on our limited SSD drives. Found a solution that was out there, but isn't really talked about because of it's complexity. Its still complex, but I simplified the steps as best as I can. I know most average users wont try this, but I just wanted to put this out there for those who would like to try.

My Windows:http://imgur.com/a/h5Mq1

I am currently running it on an 128GB Samsung EVO+ 25MB/s Write and 80MB/s Read. 2013 Macbook Air (8GB RAM) 

I love OS X(macOS)/Linux because installing it on an USB hard drive is exactly how you would install it on your system drive. On Windows, you get an error. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Warning:** What ever storage medium you use, it will require the whole drive. So backup what ever is on that drive to another system. It will wipe your USB Drive/SD Card completely (That means all partitions of the USB Drive/SD Card).

--------------------------------------------------
**IF YOU FEEL OR THINK THAT ANY OF THE STEPS PROVIDED IS COMPLICATED. DO NOT EVEN TRY TO ATTEMPT IT. DO NOT INSTALL ON AN SD CARD OR FLASH DRIVE AS A PERMANENT SOLUTION. PLEASE USE USB 3.0 EXTERNAL HDD/SSD's INSTEAD.**
-----------------------------------------------
___________________________
**Limitations:**

1.Full Windows 10 is installed, but it runs as if its Windows To Go. You can install and run apps and most likely do what you can on Windows 10. (So far, the only limitation I found is the major update issue in the 2nd limitation)

Windows To Go Info:https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831833(v=ws.11).aspx

2.You cannot update your system if there are major updates like Windows 10 to WIndows 10.1. (This is a very weird issue by Windows)

3.**For SD Card Installations (Highly Not Recommended). It's expensive, limited performance, and limited writes. You might kill your SD card really fast running an OS on it. Make Sure your card can at least do 25MB/s Writes and 48-80MB/s Reads. I recommend SD Cards with 90+MB/s Reads and 90+MB/s Writes. Limitations for SD cards are that you can only do one thing at a time or your system will lock up when you are using it.**

apple,Random observation: Apple changed up a whole bunch of different things with the iPhone packaging this year.,"A few changes I've noticed:

* The iPhone is no longer the first thing you see when you open the box. It's now sitting below the *""Designed by Apple in California""* paperwork.

* The box is easier to open. It has less of that slow, deliberate slide. It seems the resistance was toned down a bit, perhaps to prevent eager fans from doing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjaxxC2bys0).

* The iPhone is now resting on the inner rim of the packaging. There's no separate piece that's cradling it.

* The EarPods come in a paper contraption rather than the plastic carrying case. And of course, this contraption includes the headphone adapter.

* The paperwork comes in a vertical sleeve rather than a folder with a horizontal tab to close it.

* The power adapter is situated vertically rather than horizontally.

* The Lightning cable is coiled circularly in paper, rather than compressed into that square plastic sleeve. Also, the cable sits underneath the EarPods rather than alongside the EarPods and power adapter.

* The Apple stickers now come on a translucent sheet and the material feels different.

* The external plastic that wraps around the box is new. Instead of the soft plastic wrap that we see on basically every product in existence, the iPhone 7 box uses a stiffer plastic material with a similar pull mechanism as my original Stainless Steel Apple Watch.

* The screen protector wrap has tabs on the sides for easier removal.

Any others that I missed? I find it interesting how Apple changed so many things, given that the packaging has been essentially the same for as long as I can remember.",263,746,2016-09-23,AAPL,0.027390645816922188,0.9329295754432678,0.03967972472310066

apple,"Low light comparison between the 6S Plus, 7 Plus, and Nexus 6P","[Linky link](http://imgur.com/a/UTlJS)

Since I have all three phones right now, I thought I'd do a comparison between them all for those who are interested. The 7 Plus is a pretty noticeable step up from the 6S Plus, which is to be expected when going from f/2.2 to f/1.8, which allows more light into the camera. However, as you can clearly see compared to the 6P with an f/2.0 aperture, it's still not nearly as important as a larger sensor. The 6P has a very large sensor when compared to most phones. Apple's noise reduction does do what it should (reduce noise!), but it also has the added side effect of reducing details. I personally feel Apple is way too aggressive with their noise reduction, because even in excellent lighting you lose almost all details in a photo when cropping/zooming. Another thing I found is that the 7 Plus retains the 6S Plus's tendency to over whiten scenes. The warmer, yellowish tone of the 6P photos is definitely more accurate to real life. 

The camera on the 7/Plus is a much needed improvement over the 6S Plus in terms of low light performance, but I still feel like Apple dropped the ball a little bit here. Especially when they went to the trouble of making even larger, more prominent camera humps. I think Apple banks on software being able to salvage a bad photo, which explains their heavy noise reduction, but at a certain point you do need more improvements on the hardware front.",293,406,2016-09-23,AAPL,0.027369413524866104,0.8225443363189697,0.15008625388145447

So, here we go! 

**Headphone Jack (or lack thereof)**

The day after my phone came in the mail I had to go teach (classical music private lessons). In my second lesson of the day, a student asked me if I knew of a good recording of a piece he was working on. I opened up Apple Music, found the piece, walked over to the stereo system, and as I picked up the aux cable in my hand, I realized that on my FIRST DAY with the new phone ""in the wild,"" I had already succumbed to the limitations of a phone with no headphone jack. 

I even posted a comment on a thread last week saying that I didn't think it would affect me that much, since I hardly ever plugged anything into my phone other than my EarPods anyway. 

I guess it's one of those things where you don't notice you need it, until you need it.

So I'll need to figure out a way to securely carry my adapter around with me at all times, just in case. Haven't found the right solution for that yet. 

The last time I had to carry around a ""dongle"" to listen to headphones on my cell phone was back in 2008 when I had [one of these bad boys](http://www.cnet.com/au/news/samsung-x820-worlds-thinnest-phone/) in college. At the time it was INCREDIBLE to me that I could load mp3s on my phone and listen to them while on the train (even with a dongle), so I didn't mind. But at this point, being able to plug any standard 3.5mm headphones into ANY phone has become such a given, that I truly think this no headphone jack debacle will take some getting used to. 

Anyway...instead of listening to my student's piece on the stereo, I played it via the new built-in stereo speakers, which leads me to...

**Built-in stereo speakers**

These are excellent. The phone really sounds 2x as loud, or louder, than my previous phone (an iPhone 6...more on that later). My student and I were able to listen to his piece on the built-in speakers and hear a really great range of sound. It was totally manageable for him to get an idea of the piece by listening to something coming out of my cell phone's built-in speakers. 

I thought it would be weird with one speaker facing you, and one pointing to the side, but surprisingly, it's not a big deal at all. The sound is totally even. Apple must have done a great job accounting for this when designing the phone.

Yesterday morning after my run, I listened to some Miles Davis while I was in the shower. I put the phone on the vanity with the speakers on, and was able to hear Birth of the Cool plenty loud enough over the running water. These speakers are the real deal.

Speaking of my run...

**Lightning EarPods**

I took my phone running and listened to podcasts on my Lightning EarPods. The new EarPods have a longer cable as compared to the old 3.5mm EarPods, and the cable also seems to be less ""sticky"" than the old cable. Not sure else how to describe it, but the cord gets tangled a lot less for me, and if it does come out a little tangled, it's much easier to undo any knots because the cord doesn't bind to itself like the old one did. 

The connection between the phone and the Lightning EarPods is fantastic. On my old iPhone 6, the EarPods would frequently short out and come loose, stopping the playback as I ran. But with the new connector I've heard Apple has reinforced the connection, and it really shows. The phone in my pocket experienced no issues with dropping the playback. In addition, the connection is very solid. I held the phone by the headphone cord and shook it up and down vigorously (over the carpet), and the phone did not come unattached. 

I don't recommend doing this, but I tried it just to see what kind of force it would take to disconnect the phone from the headphone cord. Turns out, it's a lot of force, so you probably don't need to worry about it becoming disconnected. 

Some people have reported problems with the Lightning EarPods ""crashing."" I'm still on 10.0.0, and I haven't had it crash on me the whole week. But I'll probably update soon. 

**Battery Life**

For me, the battery life hasn't been quite lasting all day. I think I've been using my phone a lot more since it's new though. Once the novelty wears off and I use it less throughout the day, I expect the battery life to catch up a bit. Usually I like browsing Reddit on my iPad, but I've been doing it a lot on my phone this week because of the ""new"" factor. I expect once I return to my old habits, the battery will improve. 

Additionally, with my old phone I would ALWAYS plug it in when I got in the car. With the new phone, I haven't been because I want to see how long it lasts on a single charge. I'm sure once I start topping it off in the car again, that will help as well. 

Basically, I haven't noticed the improved battery life really (and this is coming from a 2 year old iPhone 6), but I hope it'll pick up once I return to a more ""normal"" amount of usage of the phone during a day. 

**New home button**

Not much to say here. Like most people, I got used to it within a day. It felt weird at first, and now it feels awesome. The Taptic Engine is really excellent, and while it doesn't quite feel exactly like pressing the old button, it feels really good and doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the phone at all. In fact, I'd say for me personally, it feels even better than the physical button because it makes the phone feel more ""solid."" The button felt flimsy to me, but the new button makes the whole phone feel like one solid piece of workmanship. I really don't know what else to say other than you should try it out and see for yourself. 

**Camera**

I didn't have that much to take pictures of this week, but took a few random pictures in low-light, etc., just to see how the camera looked. You've probably seen plenty of low-light photos already, so you know how much that has improved. I do a lot of hiking/camping/outdoor things, so I usually have a ton of great scenery I'm trying to capture. I can't wait to take this phone out on the trail and see what kind of shots I can get, but so far this week it's just been work and home, which doesn't afford really incredible photo opportunities. 

But luckily, the perfect picture taking opportunity happened tonight. My girlfriend brought home a pregnant foster dog last week from the animal shelter, and the dog went into labor tonight. So I had my iPhone 7 out documenting the delivery of her 5 puppies. I took all sorts of photos. There were some ""lower light"" photos due to shadows of people hanging around the dogs. But I was most impressed with the quality of the videos that I took, as well as the ability of the phone to focus quickly on the wiggling puppies, even when I held the lens only a couple inches away from the puppies. 

Even more impressive is when you consider that in some of the shots, you can even see my own hand because she asked me to do something, like hold the mom's head back, but I was still taking photos with one hand. So the camera was wiggling all over the place, the subjects were wiggling all over the place, and the light was fluctuating greatly due to the fact that my girlfriend and I kept moving in front of the light as we reached all around trying to help the mom dog deliver her litter.

[HERE](http://imgur.com/a/loHIB) is a short album of some of the better shots I got of the puppies tonight. None of these photos have been edited in any way. This is exactly how they appear from the camera. Keep in mind that in these photos, all the newborn puppies were wiggling every which way. These photos are AMAZINGLY crisp and clear considering the subject that I was shooting. 

While I'm discussing the camera, it's a good time to mention the...

**Storage/Photos/Display**

My iPhone 6 was 64gb. This one is 128, so double the capacity for the same price. I keep a LOT of apps on my phone, and I take a LOT of pictures. I was constantly running out of space on my iPhone 6. I'd have to download all my pictures to my computer and delete them from my phone at least once a month to keep space free for more photography. So far, I've taken 500+ photos and 30+ videos on my iPhone 7 and I've still got 75gb free. I'm very happy with the new storage tiers, and I think it'll be a huge help for people like me who take a lot of photos.

The new Photos app is excellent. I especially love being able to search for things via text input, and having the machine recognize objects/people in the photos. So far I've tried searching for these search terms:

Mountain, Dog, Tuxedo, House, Music, Outdoor, Food, Car, and a few other things, and it brings up photos with those elements in them with 100% accuracy every time. Honestly, it's amazing to me that this kind of image recognition is happening on my phone. 

The new display isn't incredibly noticeable to me. The ""wide color gamut"" that they touted in the keynote isn't really noticeable even when viewing the same photo side by side with my iPhone 6. Not much to say about this one. I'm sure some people really notice and love the new display, but I haven't noticed a huge difference. 

**Jet Black**

One of the things I agonized over when placing my pre-order was Jet Black or (matte) Black. In the end I went with Jet Black because I loved the shiny black surface and it reminded me of a grand piano. Plus, I'm one for extremes, and I wanted to have the most ""extreme"" color of the blacks. 

I read about the problems with fingerprints, and I read about the problems with micro-abrasions on the Jet Black body. 

I choose to not use a case with my phone. I know some people will think I'm nuts, but I prefer to use the phone as-is, and to appreciate Apple's stellar design. Plus, I really loved the way my iPhone 5 looked after two years of ""love."" It obviously was a well-used phone, but it functioned perfectly. I enjoyed the fact that my iPhone 5 looked like it had been well used and enjoyed for its two-year lifespan. 

So with that in mind, I thought it wouldn't be such a big deal if my Jet Black iPhone 7 started showing micro-abrasions (or even more) over the course of weeks, or months. 

First the fingerprints: not an issue for me personally. I don't show off my phone to others, so nobody's really examining it all the time. In addition, I keep it in a front pocket all by itself, so I think sliding in and out of my pocket several times per day cleans the fingerprints off it pretty well. 

[HERE](http://imgur.com/a/XgEhH) is a photo of the phone (taken with my old iPhone 6) after just pulling it out of my pocket. I did not clean the phone in any way. This is exactly as it appears after pulling it out. Fingerprints are hardly noticeable. 

Second, the ""micro-abrasions"": after a week, you can already see a few. I tried really hard to catch them in the light the exact right way so they're visible. 

[HERE](http://imgur.com/a/0XeXt) are a couple shots I was able to get where you can see some micro-abrasions. Honestly, you can't even see them unless you hold the phone at a really specific angle and are looking for them. When I hold it at normal viewing distance and turn the phone over, I can't even see them. I had to hold it very close to my eye and let the light catch it just right in order to make them visible. We'll see how it fares after 2 years (I keep all my iPhones for 2 years before upgrading), but for now, I really don't see any micro-abrasions, and after a couple years, I doubt I'll care.

Finally, I wanted to touch a little on what I've appreciated the most since...

**Upgrading from iPhone 6**

The two biggest things (other than what I've mentioned so far) that I've noticed coming from an iPhone 6 to a 7 are Force Touch, and the performance upgrades. 

Force Touch is excellent, and really feels natural to me. I upgraded my 6 to iOS 10 a few days before getting my iPhone 7, and I have to say, iOS 10 on an iPhone 6 (or any iPhone with no Force Touch capability) seemed annoying. In order to work around the lack of Force Touch, iOS 10 had to implement SO MANY extra clicks and presses in order to accomplish the same tasks. In the few days I used iOS 10 on my old phone, I was getting really fed up with how much LONGER everything took to accomplish. 

Thankfully this was all solved with the addition of Force Touch. iOS 10 was truly built for a device featuring Force Touch, so if your phone doesn't have it, that addition alone seems to be a HUGE improvement in my opinion. 

Coming from an iPhone 6, the performance upgrades are HUGE. Overall, iOS 10 ran very well on my iPhone 6, but certain apps (snapchat, Facebook, some games, etc.) were incredibly slow on my iPhone 6. On my iPhone 7, everything is lightning fast. The difference is truly night and day coming from a 6. 

I'm not sure how it would feel upgrading from a 6S to a 7, but if you're still on a 6 with much less performance AND no Force Touch, the iPhone 7 feels like a gigantic upgrade. 

The only annoyances with upgrading were Apple Pay and my Apple Watch. 

With Apple Pay, I had to start from scratch and re-input all my card info. I understand they do this for security reasons, which I appreciate. So I grin and bear it. No big deal, since it protects my accounts. But know that you'll need to re-input all your credit cards into Apple Pay on a new device. 

And in order to pair your Apple Watch with a new phone, you'll need to completely wipe the watch, pair it with the new phone, and then restore the watch from a backup. The whole watch re-pairing process took me about 45 minutes (on a series 0 watch). I wish there were a way to un-pair and re-pair an Apple Watch with a new phone without wiping the entire thing, but it was a minor annoyance, and I won't need to do it again for 2 years. 

Overall, I'm really pleased with the iPhone 7. If you are currently on an iPhone 6, I'd recommend the upgrade for sure. If you're on a 6S and it's still working fine for you, I'd probably hold off for now. 

These are my impressions after living with my iPhone 7 for a week. Feel free to ask any follow up questions below and I'll do my best to get to any that people have.",129,372,2016-09-24,AAPL,0.03683697246015072,0.9004760980606079,0.06268692202866077
apple,My Experience with iOS and the iPhone 7 as a Lifelong Android User,"Inspired by recent threads, I decided to make a post detailing my initial experience using an iPhone and iOS as someone who had previously exclusively owned Android smartphones. For background, I am a college sophomore.

My smartphone list (First to current) is as follows: HTC Droid Incredible (VZW) --&gt; HTC Rezound (VZW) --&gt; Samsung Galaxy Nexus (VZW) --&gt; Samsung Galaxy SIII (VZW) --&gt; LG Nexus 5 (T-Mobile) --&gt; Moto Nexus 6 (T-Mobile) --&gt; Huawei Nexus 6P (T-Mobile) --&gt; Apple iPhone 7+ (T-Mobile)

As someone who had exclusively used Android since the beginning of high school, I considered myself well encased within Google's ecosystem. Although I use a Mac, I keep all of my information within Google (Drive, calendar, contacts, email, photos, etc). 

After having a couple issues with the 6P, as well as a lot of issues with the way Android/Google is progressing (Primarily the transition away from open source and the lack of transparency with respect to issues), I decided to give the iPhone a try. I stayed up and reserved a 7+ at my nearby store, and enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program. After almost 2 full days with the phone, here are my initial thoughts:

**Build/Design:**
The build is amazing. Way better than any Android phone I've ever used. No competition. The buttons are clicky, the phone is sturdy, and there don't seem to be any oversights in terms of build quality. The back of the phone is smooth, and there isn't a hump like the 6P had. The phone feels like it was very well thought out in terms of design. One thing especially that I like is the mute switch. I never realized how useful it would be, as I tend to keep my phone muted a decent amount of the time (More on this in the software section). The camera bump is a thing, but it doesn't really bother me. The home button (Or home pad, I guess) is built well, and I really like the slight chamfer around the screen. **A+**

**Screen:**
This one actually surprised me a bit. Coming from a 6P, I was prepared to be let down by the 1080P, IPS display equivalent to my Nexus 5. However, the iPhone's display is really really good. It's not OLED, and it's not QHD, but it's a lot better than I expected it to be. And, It is pretty visible in sunlight, which is a huge plus. Colors are more accurate, and I really like that it get's so bright. 3D touch is awesome, but I'll talk about that more in the software section. Comparing it to the 6P, I'd give it an **A-**

**Camera:**
I haven't used this enough to really get a sense of how good the camera is, so I'm not going to spend much time on it. My basic summary is that the iPhone has a much better camera in terms of the physical sense, but Google does a better job processing the photo afterwards. Overall, I'd give the iPhone a slight edge due to the hardware zoom presented by the dual cameras, but I hope Apple focuses on their processing software for things like low light performance.

**Speakers:**
They're pretty good. They seem to get a decent amount louder than my 6P, but definitely don't sound as good. The 6P had a lot more substance to its sound, whereas the iPhone sounds just the slightest bit tinny. Overall, that isn't such a big issue for me because I don't really listen to music using the speakers, as I prefer headphones. When showing videos to friends, the extra volume can be helpful. I don't mind the trade off, but I'd give the 6P an edge here. **B+**

**Ports:**
Not a whole lot here. Lightning is fine, although I'd prefer USB-C just because I already have a bunch of cords for it. Also the fast charging would be nice. In terms of the headphone jack, my biggest complaint is that I can't listen to music/charge the phone at the same time. I really don't mind the dongle, as I only use the 3.5mm jack in my car, which doesn't have bluetooth audio, and with one pair of headphones. I'll probably buy a second adapter and just leave one in my car. Plus, I generally get things stuck in my headphone jack anyways (Sand, lint, etc) so this saves me that hassle. **B**

**Taptic Engine:**
I really like this. A lot. I love how Apple integrated it into little things in the system, like pulling up control center. The vibrations are really good. They feel a bit more pronounced than the 6P. In terms of the home button, I can tell that it's not a real button, but it doesn't bother me that much. I really wish Apple would integrate it into their keyboard, because I grew to love that about Android. Hopefully that happens soon in the future. **A**

**Battery:**
This is probably less of a hardware aspect and more of a software aspect, but holy hell is the battery good. On my 6P, I did have some battery issues with Nougat, but with Marshmallow, I would generally get about 2 hours of screen on time and about 12 hours of total time on before I had to recharge. On the iPhone, I currently have just under 11 hours total time on, about 3 hours of total use, and I'm still sitting at 66% left. This is amazing. And, I'm at about 60% brightness with full push from 3 email accounts, tweetbot streaming, and several social media apps. This herculean battery more than makes up for the lack of fast charging. **A+++++**

**Software:**
This was my first iOS experience since iOS 8 on an iPad, and first on a mobile device since iOS 4 on my old iTouch, so it's been a while.

First and foremost, the apps. It is clear that the A10 Fusion, as well as the fact that Java is not present in the coding process for developers, makes a massive difference in terms of the apps. They are incredibly quick and responsive. It's amazing. I also think that developers tend to spend more time on iOS, because of both the lack of fragmentation and the user base. Most apps in general just feel much more polished on iOS, some of which are basically unusable on Android (I'm looking at you, Snapchat...)

iOS as a whole feels good. It's polished for sure, and you can tell Apple put a lot of work into it. Unlike Android, most design elements remain consistent, especially in Apple's own apps. Google could learn a thing or two in terms of the design process. I still prefer Material Design, but even Google refuses to design some apps according to their own guidelines. It's just not as widespread as it should be on Android. 

Control Center is nice, but I feel like it would be better served in the notification shade. I do really like the separate page just for music controls. In terms of functionality, it's pretty much all there, although I'd like the opportunity to be able to enter the WiFi/Bluetooth menus by 3D touching their icons or something. 

Notifications are not as good on iOS, in my opinion. In terms of receiving them, I like the popups that iOS offers (Which are now standard in Android as well), but I really miss the notification grouping that Android offered, as well as the ability to swipe them away. 

3D touch is awesome. I'm actually surprised how many uses there are for it, as it's still a pretty new feature in iOS. I hope more developers take advantage of it and add it to their apps.

The settings menu is a mess. It needs to be categorized better. I genuinely have no idea where to go to find certain things, and that's an issue. I'm sure I can find them eventually, so that's not the biggest problem, but I also consider myself very technically proficient. I can't even count the amount of times I've had to help my mom find a setting because it was hidden somewhere random. It's just annoying.

Multitasking is fine, but the fact that the home screen is there is kind of weird. I don't see why it's there if we already have a dedicated button for it. Not a big issue, though.

Continuity/Handoff are awesome. Being able to send texts from my laptop, as well as open apps and keep doing whatever I'm doing is really cool. Earlier, I was browsing a reddit thread in Safari on my MacBook Pro, and iOS recognized that it was reddit and offered to open it in the Reddit app. Really really convenient. 

Updates are cool. No more will I have to wait for an OTA to roll out to my device, which is awesome. Also, Apple proactively updates and addresses major issues when they happen, unlike Google with the Nougat battery bug. For example, iOS 10.0.2 fixes a bug where the headphone playback controls don't work, which I had noticed this morning. Quick, easy fix pushed to phones immediately.

Volume is really my only major complaint about the OS. I HATE the fact that there's only one volume setting for the whole system. On Android, there's a ringer volume for ringing/notifications/system sounds, a media volume, and an alarm volume. Although it's a bit of a hassle to change them all, it makes sure that you can, say, watch a video at low volume and still be confident that your alarm would blast you awake in the morning. I'm sure I'll get used to the one volume switch eventually, but for now, it's really annoying. I hope Apple adds something like this in the future.


I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot of things, and I've only had the phone for a day, so I'm sure I'll come up with more things to add. Moving to a new operating system is scary, but also pretty fun. And, my friends won't tell me to stop being green now :). I still love Android, but for now, I think iOS/iPhone is the best OS/device for me. Overall, the phone experience is awesome, and I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone.",151,278,2016-09-24,AAPL,0.02591205108910799,0.8977427879969279,0.07634518543879192

apple,"My grandma is looking to buy a smartphone, but she has some vision impairment as well as parkinson's. She asked me (an Android user) to help her decide on one that'd work for her.

She is suffering from some vision impairment, and can't read small text at all; in addition to that she also has (light) Parkinson's.  
That said, she's been an avid PC and tablet user for years, and she's using a 3rd gen iPad as her main device, so the OS in itself is not a problem. She was hoping to stay with iOS for the apps she already has, but is open to switching. On Android, I know how to make the launcher icons bigger, as well as adjust the DPI and so on, but I don't know if this is possible on iPhones. She was also worried about 3D touch, since she has to use a stylus and wasn't sure if that'd work with one.

Would you recommend an iPhone for her? Additionally, do you think she'd prefer a smaller one (easier to hold? I know she only uses the iPad with a stand, because she can't hold it very well), or a Plus (for the larger screen)?

apple,"With all this hype about the new phones, I thought I'd share my story","First off, I was a huge Apple hater when I saw more and more people getting iPhones where I live ( they're still super expensive, +24% VAT) , and I couldn't understand why on earth would want something like that (2010).

&amp;nbsp;


On top of that, no one I know uses a Mac, literally I have never seen one in coffee shops, libraries, bars etc. because apparently they're really unpopular here, and quite pricy. Maybe a DJ or two, but none of the people I knew. Everyone used Windows.

&amp;nbsp;


Skip a few years and got my first smartphone. A windows phone that was quite dear to me as I loved the interface and that it had quite the good specs for its time ( wow, Carl Zeiss on a camera?! And it has a flash? I'm in.) This was in 2012 when I never ever thought I'd like/own anything by Apple.

&amp;nbsp;


Pretty much up until now, I wasn't drawn to the idea, I stuck to windows phones and didn't care that much about anything else.

&amp;nbsp;


The 6s was out and I thought it looks good, but still didn't feel one way or the other towards Apple ( my hate period morphed into carelessness).

&amp;nbsp;


But then the SE was announced, and the  for the first time ever I felt excitement for an Apple product. It was weird. I thought ""wow, they really have the balls to release a phone with a slightly old design. How cool!""
Since June I am a happy owner of an iPhone SE. Honestly, it doesn't compare to anything. I love the size and and I love how good this thing can look and feel. Plus, the iOS 10 runs perfectly on it.

apple,Where to report Apple Store experience?,"Does anyone know where one can provide feedback on experiences in an Apple Store? 

Today I had a terrible and very embarrassing experience while purchasing a new case for my iPad at the Santa Monica Promenade Store. I scanned the barcode of the box with EasyPay, used TouchID to process my payment, and proceeded to leave the store as I normally do. Upon reaching the door, I was grabbed by three people: two of which were security and one was undercover Apple loss prevention (I assume, he flashed a loss prevention badge). I would have been fine if they had calmly approached me and asked for proof of purchase, but instead they aggressively pulled me me back into the store with both arms and publicly accused me of shoplifting. 

Understanding that Apple has to prevent theft (which I am in complete support of, having worked retail to get me through college), there has to be a better protocol these employees can follow. They caused a scene with me at the center of it, and when I pulled up my receipt on my phone to show that I had indeed purchased the case, I only received a ""Finish your purchase in the store next time"" before walking away. I had completed my purchase, and would have appreciated an apology for the misunderstanding!

I hope this is an isolated incident and that Apple doesn't condone this kind of approach. It was embarrassing being treated like a criminal in front of other customers and Apple employees. I won't be shopping at that store anymore, and will probably stop using EasyPay altogether.

apple,"If Apple is fighting for every .1mm of space in the iPhone, how the heck are they going to reduce the top/bottom bezels anytime soon? I just can't see it happening next year.","If they needed to remove a small 3.5mm port on *one side, one corner* of the device to add the larger haptic sensor with extra battery life, how the hell will they manage to reduce or remove the nose and chin of our beloved iPhone's?  If the iPhone Plus models didn't have such a large footprint I think they'd be astonishingly good.  Now we have dual cameras, faster processors with 2x the cores, much larger taptic motors, more speakers, and essentially ZERO FREE SPACE leftover.  I don't see them making iPhone 8/9/10 thicker, and I especially don't see them making the devices physically smaller with the same features without dropping tons of battery life.  

Is the rumored edge-to-edge screen potentially filling the same front chassis? Maybe a new aspect ratio to give us digital home buttons? I'm just really curious about all this stuff.",166,162,2016-09-30,AAPL,0.01788773201406002,0.9067664742469788,0.07534579932689667
apple,Here is an example of when shooting RAW photos on your iPhone 7 provides major benefits.,"[*****LINK TO ALBUM*****](http://imgur.com/a/SJhdp)

First thing first: **in MOST situations, it is best to just take normal JPEG photos with your phone.** Apple applies a lot of ""secret sauce"" to every picture taken that will 99 times out of 100 give you a better picture that an edited raw photo (e.g. facial recognition, multi-photo stitching, great noise reduction, etc.)



BUT, if you are shooting nature or landscape photos with very little camera movement, you can get *much* better photos by using a RAW capture app. The amount of data available for edit is unbelievable! You can change the white balance, and it will look just as good as if the adjustment had been made when the photo was taken! There is a ton of information in the highlights and shadows that can be brought back out.",85,158,2016-09-30,AAPL,0.016857393085956573,0.9047282934188843,0.07841438800096512
