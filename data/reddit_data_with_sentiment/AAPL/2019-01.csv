ipad,A New Approach to iPad OS,"*TL;DR:* A reimagined iPad OS featuring a new multitasking paradigm, robust file support, external device management, and vastly improved keyboard control.

*January 2019*

By u/thomanthony

It's 6:30 in the evening and I've only just arrived home.

The train was crowded tonight, so I couldn't find a place to sit. Instead I squeezed alongside several other weary commuters and tried to focus on a podcast, not the slowly encroaching smell from somewhere in the back of the car.

Still, the first thing I want to do when I finally recline on my sofa isn't to switch on the next episode of my newest HBO thrill (seriously, if you haven't yet seen *Barry*, you're missing out). No, I want to get back to work on this article.

Why, you ask? Why would he want to keep working after nine hours of video editing and copywriting? Because this is about my new iPad Pro, and I honestly can't put the device down.

In the days and weeks since these 13-inches of glass and aluminum appeared on my doorstep, I’ve drawn more, read more, and watched more video on-the-go than in the entirety of the last year. I’ve once again started exploring the iOS app ecosystem and, honestly, been impressed (LumaFusion, wow!).

This is quite possibly the most exciting peice of technology I’ve acquired in the last decade and, yes, I’m including the iPhone X in that calculation. The last time I bought an iPad was in 2012 when the first Retina screen equipped model hit the market. And I loved it. But it quickly was relegated to the job of a full-color Kindle replacement and kitchen recipe manager. It simply couldn’t run the apps I needed and lack of a cellular connection made it far less useful as a mobile computing platform.

But sitting here in 2018, the iPad has come a very long way.

It's blazing fast. It's slim and light. The screen is simply incredible. And the app ecosystem is vastly improved. Others have written ad nauseum about the device, so I'll spare you anymore gushing.

Instead, I want to focus on the ways in which Apple could take this incredible hardware and pair it with updated software that takes full advantage of the device's strengths.

## Bigger Screens, More Possibilities

When it launched in 2007, the design of the iPhone home screen was beautiful in it’s simplicity: a grid of apps, each taking full control of (at the time) a large touchscreen and transforming the device into exactly what was needed by the user. Tap, boom, it’s a camera. Tap, a messenging device. Tap, a widescreen iPod with video.

While applications running on a universal OS was nothing new, multi-touch interactions on a pocketable device were. The smartphone itself faded away to become an intuitive means of performing actions.

But as the number of apps installed on a given device increased, along with the hardware capabilities of the devices, so too did the need to use mulitple apps simultaneously. Multitasking made its way over from desktop and notebook platforms. But still, the home screen remained untouched.

Even with the introduction of iPad in 2010, the grid stayed the same. We have the widget page, but that has always felt tacked on.  iOS is begging for something new and more powerful. Rumours have it that Apple is working on a new design, but it never hurts to explore other options. So with that, here’s a new take on iPad OS, built for the needs of today.

## The Home Screen

After unlocking one’s iPad, the Home Screen is the first thing a user sees. The grid of apps, while it mostly worked in the past, it now seems dated. Apart from a few notification badges, it gives the user little sense of where they are and what tasks need to be accomplished.

On the Mac, when a user unlocks their device, they are immediately taken to whatever state the machine was left in. Maybe it's a browser and notes app. Maybe it’s an open Photoshop composition. The iPad does something similar, but because of its more constrained multitasking paradigm, simply showing the last open app (or apps) is less indicitive of what a user is working on. A new approach should build on the multitasking system, while also giving the user a better overall view of the device and what actions thay can take next.

I’m dubbing this new system: “Aerial.”

## Aerial: A New Overview of Your Work

Aerial introduces a new default page on the home screen and gives the user an at-a-glance view of the all active projects, notifications, and to-dos on their device. It is broken into three sections: Last Active, the Side Bar, and of course our old friend the Dock.

## 

[Aerial Home Screen](https://i.redd.it/ph0b95x323821.png)

## Last Active

The left portion of the home screen is the largest and is dedicated to the applications most recently in use by the user. By default, the four most recently opened applications and Workspaces (more on those later) are visible, and the user can swipe vertically to scroll and view more.

These applications and Workspaces are displayed as previews with their icon(s) at the bottom. Next to the icon is a badge indicating any notifications associated with the app.

&amp;#x200B;

[App and Workspace Notifications](https://i.redd.it/m5t8yozbz2821.jpg)

## Side Bar

The rightmost third of the home screen  houses a Side Bar for all the user's notifications and widgets. It closely resembles the Side Bar on MacOS. This section can be fully customized, much like the Widget screen.

At the top of the Side Bar, there are two options: Today and Notifications. A numerical indicator displays how many unread notifications are waiting for the user. Today displays a user's Widgets.

&amp;#x200B;

[Notifications View](https://i.redd.it/78zegw2m03821.jpg)

[Today View](https://i.redd.it/1bc3ch2m03821.jpg)

Along the bottom of this list is a Spotlight field, allowing quick search actions - apps, contacts, or the web.

## The Dock: Quick Access to Everything that Matters

Largely unchanged from the Dock as we know it in iOS 12, there are three major additions to the new and improved Dock: Launcher, Recent Files, and Connected Devices.

## Launcher

Tapping the Launcher displays a list of the installed apps on the device. The user can specify whether they’d like them in alphabetical order or by most recently used. There is also a search function here. The Launcher is especially useful when a user wants to launch an app without leaving their currently active app.

&amp;#x200B;

[Launcher](https://i.redd.it/20g7a4se03821.jpg)

Aerial Homecreen also be able to add Shortcuts to the Launcher, much in the sand way they can currently add them to the home screen or Shortcuts widget.

## Recent Files

Recent Files opens a stack of the most recently opened documents and files across all apps. Both the Launcher and Recent Files functions can be removed from the Dock in System Preferences, if desired by the user.

&amp;#x200B;

[Recent Files](https://i.redd.it/28s2wcob03821.jpg)

While the Files app icon can currently do some of this, it is limited by the fact that many apps do not make their documents accessible from within the Files app. The Recent Files stack is really part of a greater framework making all a user's documents more accessible from more places. This will be discussed in more detail later.

## Connected Devices

The last addition to the Dock is a stack for any Connected Devices. This icon appears immediately when a compatible device is connected to the iPad. Tapping the icon launches the appropriate app to interact with the device. Multiple devices will always collapse into a single stack on the Dock.

&amp;#x200B;

[Connected Devices](https://i.redd.it/ychegb9803821.jpg)

In addition to opening the appropriate app, this dock stack also displays the current state of the device: backing up, recording, or any number of other functions.

## The Lock Screen

Tap your iPad screen or hit the Sleep/Wake button and the iPad's beautiful screen comes to life. But apart from a few notifications, the lock screen provides little else.

For some this simple, calming space might be perfect. Pick a wallpaper and enjoy. But for power users this huge expanse of screen, the first thing you see when grabbing your device, seems like a bit of a waste. But what should Apple do with this opportunity? The answer is already in your pocket.

On the iPhone, the lock screen has only two dedicated software buttons. One launches the camera, the other the flash. But on iPad, we have the opportunity to give the user a variety of quick actions that can be easily accessed with no delay. This will take two forms: Quick Action Buttons and Pencil Actions.

## Quick Action Buttons

By adding these action buttons directly to the lock screen, users will be able to quickly jump into any number of different system or third party apps, even if they don't have a Pencil. Like the Control Center, these buttons should be fully customizable. Default buttons could be New Note, Compose Mail, New Reminder, etc. Appps should also be able to donate Quick Action Buttons, in the same way they donate Shortcuts.

&amp;#x200B;

[Quick Action Buttons](https://i.redd.it/w6s00o6503821.jpg)

## Pencil Actions

Currently, tapping the iPad's lock screen with the Pencil launches a new Note. While this is a nice start, the function is not customizable. Users should be able to set a system preference for a Pencil tap.

Additionally, if desired, the user should be able to tap-and-slide the pencil to select different apps, Workspaces, or even specific files which have been pinned to the lock screen. Simple place the top of the pencil on the screen and then slide to the left or right to pick from all the available apps.

&amp;#x200B;

[Tap-and-Slide Pencil Actions Interface](https://i.redd.it/i4u05zu103821.jpg)

## Multitasking

We are doing more on-the-go than ever. For many users, a phone or tablet is all they need. But accomplishing complex tasks involving multiple apps can often be challenging on these devices. Split View, introduced in iOS 9, was a huge step forward for iPad users, but it doesn’t quite go far enough and interactions with apps in this mode are often cumbersome. For that reason, Apple ought to refine the UI for multitasking and enable apps to do more in those multitasking setups.

## Mission Control

The first improvement I am recommending is a new method to view currently open applications and switch between them. It unifies the current multitasking view with Spotlight and Control Center, and borrows it's name from a familiar MacOS feature: Mission Control.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mission Control](https://i.redd.it/xk6063vvz2821.jpg)

Cmd+Space or swipe-and-hold from the bottom of the screen and iPad will present the new Mission Control view. Much like the Aerial view on the home screen, apps and workspaces fill the left two-thirds of the screen. To the right of those, is control center. The Dock is along the bottom. A Spotlight field at the top of the screen will immediatly become active and allow the user to type a few keystrokes to open an app, search the web, or perform a host of other functions.

If a Bluetooth keyboard is connected, Cmd+Tab will also open this view, but will immediately highlight the last open the app or workspace and allow the user to tab through open apps.

## Workspaces

Again, Split View has been a real boon to iPad productivity. However, the app groupings permitted with it are far from perfect. The largest issue with multitasking in Split View is limiting an app to only one pairing. This is solved by our next innovation: Workspaces.

Workspaces are programmable, responsive app-groupings that can be summoned with a gesture or keyboard shortcut.

## Multiple App Instances

Individual apps can be added to mulitple workspaces, in different multitasking layouts, and even enable pinning a specific section or document inside of an app to the workspace, for instance a specific note, illustration, or video editing project.

Each Workspace remembers where you are in a given app, so there's no managing windows, just add the app to the Workspace and navigate to the note section you want pinned there. It stays at that section of the app until the user changes it.

When selected from the Dock, Launcher, or home screen grid, a single tap will launch the last active instance of the app, while a long press or Opt+Return will present a dialog to pick from all available instances.

## Customization

Workspaces can be easily duplicated and then modified to a user’s liking, by tapping a button in Mission Control. They can be renamed following the same procedure as would be used for a home screen folder. Lastly, workspaces can be added to the Dock, just like any individual app. When placed on the Dock, the user will be prompted to choose an icon for the Workspace.

## Layout

Each Workspace can accomodate up to 4 apps: two in Split View, two as Slide Over panes. Split View apps be laid out in the same current 50/50 or 67/33 arrangements. The only change to these is that 50/50 is now honored when the iPad is in a portrait orientation.

Users can also choose to have Slide Over apps be universal to the system, rather than locked to a specific Workspace.

## Navigation

Using the Dock to switch apps in Multitasking works, but leaves a lot to be desired. Adding the Launcher to the Dock also helps, but users should have an even quicker method.

When in a workspace, each app panel dispays small indicator bar at the of the screen. Tapping and dragging down on this indicator will minimize the app to a preview window and then drop it into a selection panel. The design of this panel is directly borrowed from the [MacStories iOS 11 Wish List](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-ipad-wishes-and-concept-video/) by Frederico Viticci from a few years ago, and would work exactly the same. Dragging the preview further down, reduces it to an icon overlaid with an “X” closing app icon. When released in this state, the app closes and the other Split View app fills the screen.

## Files

At the center of any workflow are the actual files being worked on. Until this point, iOS has largely treated files as secondary to apps. But with the introduction of the Files app, Apple finally broke files on iOS free from their app specific cages. For this future vision of working on iPad, we're going to take managing files to the next level.

As mentioned earlier, users will now see Recent Files on their Dock. Further, from the Files app or share sheet in any app, any file can be pinned directly to the Dock (and anywhere else on the home screen). For example, a specific file in Files, drawing in Procreate, or a project in Things. One tap takes you directly to the linked file in the last application with which it was viewed. A Force Touch or long press will allow users to select any compatible app with which to open the file.

## External Storage

The introduction of USB-C has finally brought an iOS device into the world of universal standard connectors. While it currently serves the same function as Lighting did previously, it opens up the possiblity of more integrations with external devices and storage.

The ability to add external storage to an iPad is low hanging fruit for Apple. In this concept, the Files app would break the current “Locations” heading into three new top-level headings: “On Your iPad,” “On the Cloud,” “Connected Storage.”

On Your iPad would contain device-level storage, including listings for any sand-boxed apps. As mentioned earlier, Apple should require developers to make the documents created in their apps viewable through the Recent Files framework, even if they are not able to be directly accessed in Files.

On the Cloud would contain any cloud-connected services such as iCloud, Dropbox, and Google Drive. These would function exactly as they do currently.

The third tier, “Connected Storage” will display any connected devices, via USB or over the network. Additionally, when an external device is attached to the iPad, it will immediately appear in the Dock. One tap on the Dock icon will launch Files and display the contents of the device. If there are multiple external storage devices attached, these Dock icons will collapse into a Stack.

Via Drag-and-Drop and the Share Sheet, files can be easily moved or copied from external storage to internal or cloud-connected storage.

## Disconnected Media

External storage devices should be fully-hotswappable and do not require “ejecting.”

Apps which no longer have access to previously used files on disconnected external storage will display a greyed-out icon for the file and, if the user attempts to open the missing file, will display a message such as “\[File Name\] is no longer available. Please connect to external storage device \[Previously Available Device Name\] to access this \[document type\]”.

## Time Machine

iOS 13 should introduce full support for Time Machine, including snapshots and full backups to external storage and iCloud.

## External Devices, Keyboards, and Text Entry

While iPad and iPhone have supported Bluetooth keyboards for nearly their entire existence, and the onscreen keyboard that premiered with the iPhone was a best in class experience, typing on iPad still leaves something to be desired. There are simply too many tradeoffs.

Use the on-screen keyboard and you get great predictive text and simple cursor movement, but typing on glass is often painfully slow. Attach a keyboard and you get a better typing experience and the power of keyboard shortcuts, but are constantly reaching up to touch a vertically oriented screen because there is no cursor support. Neither solves all the problems.

Apple needs to improve both of these typing experiences if they want the iPad to be a truly desktop class writing platform.

## Onscreen keyboard

## Swipe typing

I've been experimenting GBoard on iPad and have found that swipe typing with the Apple Pencil to be a very interesting way of composing text. I'm not as fast as I would be with a real keyboard, but generally find that I'm able to keep up with my ideas as they flow out. The biggest problem with this style of typing is that the iPad keyboard is simply to large for swiping to feel fluid and avoid accidently lifting the Pencil tip off the glass mid-word.

Apple should introduce a swipe keyboard for iPad, where the keys are closer together and the rest of the space is used for other text controls. I find this style of typing is best suited for situations where the iPad is in my lap, and I'm casually editing text or outlining a larger writing project.

&amp;#x200B;

[Swipe Keyboard](https://i.redd.it/5npiol7lz2821.jpg)

Above the swipe area, the user will see a realtime readout of the entered text. This will greatly help with accuracy, since often the actual document is much further up the screen.

By collapsing the swipe area to a small section of the keyboard, and allowing the user to choose left- or right-handed modes, swipe typing could easily become the fastest input method without a keyboard attached.

The remaining portion of the keyboard can be used as a multifunction area: Emoji picker, sketch pad, and track pad.

## Handwriting to Text

Again, the Apple Pencil has been a remarkable addition to my computing life, but it astounds me that there is still no true handwriting to text features on the iPad. Even the Apple Watch has it! Instead, Apple has relinquished this functionality to third parties, but none are able to really solve the problem.

A handwriting solution must feel intuitive and native. It should be as easy as writing on paper. It should also happen in realtime, so any errors can be seen by the user and quickly corrected.

&amp;#x200B;

[Handwriting keyboard](https://i.redd.it/548g8karz2821.jpg)

Much like the swipe input keyboard, the handwriting mode displays the entered text in realtime and only enters it into the document after the user pauses for a second. Depending on the user's preferred writing hand, controls such as Shift and Return will appear to the right or left of the text entry area. Edits to text can be made by crossing out a word (delete), triple underlining a letter (capitalize), or any other standard copyediting notations. These notations can be viewed quickly in a cheat sheet with a tap of a button.

&amp;#x200B;

[Copyediting cheat sheet](https://i.redd.it/izskgsxgz2821.jpg)

## Hardware Keyboards

Attach an external keyboard to iPad and many users suddenly have a very compelling laptop replacement. However, for the reasons discussed earlier, lack of a pointing device makes navigating the iPad's user interface somewhat challenging when it is upright on a desk or propped up in your lap.

But with a few small tweaks to the way keyboards interact with iOS, many of these issues could be almost entirely eliminated.

## Touch surfaces

The first and most dramatic change would be the introduction of a horizontal plane of touch interaction. While I'm not arguing for a full on mouse-and-pointer for the iPad, I do think that being able to quickly move a selection point in a document or navigating the home screen would be improved dramatically by a track pad.

In practice, the design and function of this touch surface would be modeled after another Apple product: the Siri Remote for Apple TV.

## Interface Navigation

Indirect manipulation of iOS interface elements presents a challenge without adding in the complication of a mouse pointer, but again this is where the Apple TV comes to the rescue. When using this track pad, UI elements will lift slightly off the plane and receive a slight glow effect.

The same effect can be applied when navigating interfaces with the keyboard.

Every interface element should be navigable with the keyboard. The shortcuts below are designed to closely resemble keyboard controls on the Mac, but are specifically tailored to iOS.

**Universal**

* Cmd+Opt+D: Show Dock
* Cmd+Opt+O: Open Launcher in the Dock
* Cmd+Opt+R: Open Recent Files in the Dock
* Cmd+Space: Open Mission Control, Spotlight input selected
* Cmd+Tab: Open Mission Control, Last Active Workspaces selected
   * Tab to cycle through available Workspaces
* Cmd+Opt+N: Open Notification Center
* Cmd+Opt+C: Open Control Center
* Arrow Keys: Move selection highlight/cursor
* Tab: Move to next field or navigate to next section of app
* Shift+Tab: Move to previous field or navigate to previous section of app

**Home Screen**

* Ctrl+Left: Navigate left to next home screen page
* Ctrl+Right: Navigate right to next home screen page

**In-App**

* Cmd+H: Go to home screen
* Cmd+Q: Close app and open app picker in its place
   * When in Split View, the user will be presented with an option to choose which app is closed. If Slide Over is active, that app will be closed.
   * If the user hits Cmd+Q a second time, the Workspace will close entirely.
* Cmd+E: Open Share Sheet
* Cmd+O: Open File Dialog
* Cmd+Left: Activate Left Slide Over app
* Cmd+Right: Activate Right Slide Over app
* Ctrl+Left: Swipe from left edge gesture
* Ctrl+Right: Swipe from right edge gesture

Obviously, this is just a short list of the keyboard shortcuts that iOS should implement. Each app will have a number of it’s own specific commands, and of course we will leave in the powerful hold Command function to reveal them in cheat sheet to the user. Third party applications will also be able to implement their own shortcuts in addition to these system actions.

But shortcuts should do more than just navigate the UI.

## Shortcuts

Under **Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard**, there will be a new keyboard shortcuts menu. Here, the user can define any keyboard shortcut or remap system shortcuts as they like. Third party apps can also donate keyboard shortcuts to this menu, as well as any Shortcut action, using the same framework that powers the Shortcuts app.

## Conclusion

Clearly, there are many other features Apple could and should implement. The afore mentioned iOS 11 wish list from MacStories is a great place to start. But the goal of this article is just to explore my thoughts after using the device for about a month.

I love the iPad and try to use it whenever possible to do my work. In fact, this entire article was written and illustrated on the iPad Pro.

I wrote it using Notes and 1Writer, partially with an Apple Wireless Keyboard and partially with GBoard's swipe typing via Apple Pencil. The illustrations were done in Concepts.

In my mind there is no doubt that the iPad is a truly powerful computer and will continue to be a larger part of my work in the coming months and years. After 8 years on the market, the iPad seems to have come into it's own.

But there is still a lot it can grow into. And I, for one, can't wait to see what comes next.",75,1036,2019-01-02,AAPL,0.044523101610442005,0.9203236599763235,0.03515321699281534

apple,"An Open Letter to iPhone Owners from Steve Jobs (Sept 6, 2007)","Posting this for discussion, since Apple’s current situation may be reminiscent of one not so long ago.. 


To all iPhone customers:

I have received hundreds of emails from iPhone customers who are upset about Apple dropping the price of iPhone by $200 two months after it went on sale. After reading every one of these emails, I have some observations and conclusions.

First, I am sure that we are making the correct decision to lower the price of the 8GB iPhone from $599 to $399, and that now is the right time to do it. iPhone is a breakthrough product, and we have the chance to ‘go for it’ this holiday season. iPhone is so far ahead of the competition, and now it will be affordable by even more customers. It benefits both Apple and every iPhone user to get as many new customers as possible in the iPhone ‘tent’. We strongly believe the $399 price will help us do just that this holiday season.

Second, being in technology for 30+ years I can attest to the fact that the technology road is bumpy. There is always change and improvement, and there is always someone who bought a product before a particular cutoff date and misses the new price or the new operating system or the new whatever. This is life in the technology lane. If you always wait for the next price cut or to buy the new improved model, you’ll never buy any technology product because there is always something better and less expensive on the horizon. The good news is that if you buy products from companies that support them well, like Apple tries to do, you will receive years of useful and satisfying service from them even as newer models are introduced.

Third, even though we are making the right decision to lower the price of iPhone, and even though the technology road is bumpy, we need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price. Our early customers trusted us, and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these.

Therefore, we have decided to offer every iPhone customer who purchased an iPhone from either Apple or AT&amp;T, and who is not receiving a rebate or any other consideration, a $100 store credit towards the purchase of any product at an Apple Retail Store or the Apple Online Store. Details are still being worked out and will be posted on Apple’s website next week. Stay tuned.

We want to do the right thing for our valued iPhone customers. We apologize for disappointing some of you, and we are doing our best to live up to your high expectations of Apple.

Steve Jobs

apple,"Over the past year, Apple has increased prices of its devices by 10-60% but still has the exact same profit margin (38-39% range). So where is this money going? Can Apple survive healthily if they lower the prices back to the usual?","Let's have a discussion whether Apple's jump in prices is justified. Considering the static profit margins, it seems Apple isn't really guilty of anything but maintaining the status quo in terms of margins. However, I am interested in understanding where is this extra money going? 

Are devices using far more sophisticated (and thus costlier) components?  In the case of the iPhone it is apparently the OLED screens, cameras and face sensors, that are pretty costly. With the MacBook Air, there was hardly any dramatic change which Apple isn't already buying in large volumes. The new iPad Pros pack a lot of power and technology, but the higher models are insanely priced for what they offer.

So where is the extra money going? The campus cost a lot. More datacenter investments? Legal expenses? Paying Irish taxes? Buying AR/VR startups? For unannounced projects? Money lost in failed projects?",370,609,2019-01-03,AAPL,0.06905297935009003,0.8520891666412354,0.07885787636041641

apple,"That time back in the 90s, when Apple had me send them porn.","Here’s a blast from the past story.

Back in the 90s I had a PowerMac G4 400 MHz tower.  And video streaming wasn’t a thing.  We use to have to download our “adult content” from FTP sites or other services such as Hotline and watch local.  (Anyone remember Hotline?)

Well, I downloaded one specific file, and I COULD NOT get QuickTime to play the file, no matter what I did.  The file was encoded in a codec called Intel Indeo, and Indeo support for QuickTime back them was new.  The file played just fine in Windows Media Player on my Windows PC.

So, I went to Apple’s site and use the contact form to send them an email that I am having Intel Indeo codec issues.

To my surprise, someone from Apple’s QuickTime team emailed me back about an hour later and asked me some questions.  After a few email exchanges, the guy asks me to please provide the video file to them, so they can see it.  And he gives me the name of an FTP server and a username and password.

Well, I have no shame, so I emailed the guy back and tell him the video is about 10 minutes long, so it’s a pretty big file (by late 90s Internet standards) and it was porn, which I am sure is against all sorts of Apple HR polices.

An hour later I get an email telling me it’s fine to upload the video, and it included a different FTP server and a different username and password.

I uploaded the file.  Two weeks later I got a beta build of QuickTime to try out.  It fixed the issue.

My wife and I got a good laugh out of it at the time.

apple,Do you know what happens to your Macbook when you send it in for repair?,"I work at an Apple repair depot, a company called CSAT Solutions. 

There is no schedule at this company. You show up for work at 7am and you could be there twelve hours. It’s impossible to make plans because you don’t know when you’ll leave. Overtime is not mandatory but you wouldn’t know it by the way they push you to have all the work done every day. Something they’ll say when hiring is “7am to finish” Recently, they have begun to hire more people because their retention rate is horrible. The problem is that most of the people they hire are incredibly incompetent. You could have never worked on a computer before and as long as you can read and write English you’re in. The result is you have a bunch of people that don’t know even the basics of troubleshooting computers repairing $2000+ machines. These people also can’t handle the workload so it puts incredible pressure on veteran techs that not only have to worry about their work but other’s work as well. To add insult to injury, these new technicians are being given a $750 bonus for staying with the company for 3 months. All the while technicians that have been at the company for a decade haven’t seen another penny. 

The air quality is terrible. There’s a thick layer of dust that’s probably been there since Nixon, covering the walls and pipes and AC ducts. It’s a warehouse environment that is climate controlled but it’s hot most of the time and even then it’s just circulating dirty air. Still, management will get on you for having a dirty/dusty workstation but wont do anything about the air quality. 

In the end you’ll get a refurbished motherboard that will most likely fail again because the company that repairs them does a shitty job. Sometimes the “new” board we’re gonna use looks worse than the one you sent your unit in with. I have received boards with corrosion and we are told to use them and cannot change it unless it fails for something.

Every aspect of this company is a joke. Their shopfloor system is always crashing. And they still expect us to finish the work. We get the units in the morning and they’re supposed to ship out at night. 

If anyone has any questions about anything I will answer. I know this seemed like more of a rant and frustration with my job but I'm finally getting fed up. Hopefully something good comes out of this.

apple,Apple charged me £25 for a battery replacement and didn't even bother to actually swap it.,"So I took my iPhone 6S into the Leeds, UK Apple Store to have my battery replaced while the £25 offer was still running (ended 31 Dec 2018).

They took my phone, I waited about 3 hours (it was busy near the Christmas holidays) and returned and paid for the service.

The chap came out and gave me my phone back. It was fully charged (not how I'd left it) so I left assuming the service had been successful. I got a confirmation email stating the battery had been installed and it even listed its serial number (Replacement Serial No: F5D818592FTG5NYBS). Proof:

https://imgur.com/a/TBB31Zq

After the following day I realised my battery performance hadn't improved at all so I began to investigate.

I used 3uTools to investigate the battery. A screenshot of what I found is at the link below:

https://imgur.com/a/m2OXr4d

It clearly states the batter has experienced more than 600+ charge cycles and the serial number does not match the replacement part serial number that I was emailed. iOS 12 also reports that ""Battery Health"" (in Settings) is 82% (which lines up with the over 500 cycles).

So basically Apple have charged me £25 and a 3 hour wait for absolutely nothing.

Apple online support have just advised me to ""go back into store"". Something that isn't that ideal when you live over 2 hours away.

Not really sure what the point of this post was. Just a bit annoyed that I've literally been scammed and if i wasn't tech savvy enough to investigate, I'd have never have known.

It makes me wonder if this was a genuine mistake or they often do this when it's ""busy"" in store.

apple,"The new iPad Pro is overpriced, limited by iOS, and structurally weak....but is an absolutely phenomenal device","Picked up the 11” iPad Pro a few weeks ago on a decent sale and having traded in my 9.7” iPad Pro so I got it for around $500. After I ordered it, the bending reports started flowing in and I was an anxiety-ridden wreck, but the Apple Gods looked down favorably upon me and it appears my model does not have a (detectable by me, anyway) bend.  I’m annoyed that I have to use such caution whenever I move the damn thing or close the device to the keyboard, but I guess I should be doing that with an expensive device anyway.

I’m not really a “power user,” I just wanted a nice, fast, portable and beautiful device with a great battery life.  This thing is just unbelievably fast, has a truly gorgeous screen, an optimal low-bezel design and the battery lasts forever. I can use this regularly for two days before needing to plug it in. I don’t have the pencil, but the keyboard is honestly pretty great and I can type on it just as fast as any other laptop. Yes, text editing is annoying, but not impossible. I’ve been making it a point to learn all the keyboard shortcuts and it really does help with the efficiency of this device.

Is Apple turning into a greedy, money-hungry group of slime balls who wish to milk the blood from every last one of their customers? Of course. Is the way they have handled the bent $1000 device issue nothing short of abhorrent? Obviously. But everything else aside, is this one of the best products they’ve delivered in the history of the company, assuming it isn’t bent? Absolutely. I’ve seen tons of negativity surrounding this device, and rightfully so, but if you’re on the fence, I’m a +1 for this product, it’s an absolute joy to use.",176,298,2019-01-06,AAPL,0.04088945314288139,0.9242109656333923,0.03489958494901657

I’m really not, this could be on a per case basis but I formatted it this way to spread the message of what COULD happen.

As the title suggests, you might be SoL if you have a bent iPad Pro. I was made aware that the staff had a conference call and bent iPads will be dealt as accidental damage.

Though I didn’t speak with the manager in this issue as I had no time, but might be lenient on a per case basis.

I’m trying to contact Apple support now to see if they can replace it under Apples Limited Warranty and going along [this](https://i.imgur.com/rhSIsj6.jpg).

Will create a new post with the outcome, but very disappointed to be told that the damage was accidental. I have Applecare+ but I don’t want to use a strike for a manufacturing defect.

EDIT: Since people can’t read comments, here’s some backstory.
The iPad was purchased as a gift for me from my uncle in early November. It was bought before Apples extended return period. 
Come present day, I opened the iPad and proceeded to use it (like a normal human being) and did not check for faults. Now, let’s be realistic, who in the general population would check for bends on a product from a company like Apple (or any company for that matter).

apple,The expensive design flaw with current gen MacBook Pros: fragile display flex cable,"Hey /r/apple. Just trying to get some awareness and discussion going about what seems to be an inevitable issue with the current generation of MacBook Pros (2016+) to which Apple still doesn't have a repair program for users out of warranty.

This video explains the issue pretty well and briefly (just watch the first 50secs): https://youtu.be/602Q00G_8rw

Basically, the problem is that Apple has used a fragile cable which connects the display with the bottom part of the laptop, and this cable, after several cycles of opening and closing the laptop lid, develops fracture(s) that end up preventing the display's backlight from working so you wouldn't be able to see anything on the screen.

And how is this to be repaired? Although the video I linked above showed the shop doing a repair on the faulty cable, it seems the best way is to replace the entire display because the cable is manufactured as part of the display assembly, and cannot be individually replaced. This video by Loius Rossmann (https://youtu.be/NzjoELvrkYo - 3min28secs), who generally seems to make board level repairs to fix issues for relatively cheap(er than official Apple prices) also sums up that a display replacement is needed. And this seems to be how Apple and Apple Authorised Service Providers are repairing devices with this issue as well (my own MBP is currently getting a display replacement for this issue by an AASP so I can vouch for this, as well as posts on the forum threads I'll add below). 

The problem with this repair method? New displays are ridiculously expensive. And for customers out of warranty? So far, they've had to foot the bill themselves. And to add: the new displays will still have the same flaw!

This cable design appears to be used in every single 13"" and 15"" MacBook Pro from the current generation, so essentially every user of the current gen MBPs could inevitably face this issue.

This is why I hope Apple will get around to establishing a repair program to freely provide repairs to customers with MBPs with this issue who are out of warranty, and to develop a better design so that future models of MBPs will not face this same problem. I hope this post will help with this, as well as to inform potential new MBP buyers to this possible problem they might face in the future so that they can make a more informed buying decision. I don't know if the 12"" MacBook or the new MacBook Air are affected by this, but I haven't seem discussion about them facing this problem (anyone able to share more knowledge about this?)

Here is a customer-made website summarising this problem: https://flexgate.me/ (yes I cringed on the '-gate' name too 😪)

apple,I’m finally in a position where I can afford the switch to Mac...but all of the current models seem severely flawed.,"My current PC (a ThinkPad T430) has been a loyal friend but is reaching its golden years. I’ve wanted to switch to Mac for a long time now and would like to finally make the jump.

The trouble is, everything in my price range ($1000 to $1600) seems to fall short in some critical way. The MacBook is underpowered, the MacBook Pro has an awful keyboard, and the Air is just overpriced for the components. Even on the desktop side the current iMacs use outdated processors and the Mac Mini is terrible value (and requires a monitor).

My question is whether anyone has a thought on old models or refurbished Macs that might be a good deal right now. I’m mostly looking for a machine to learn Unix on and take online courses, with some video watching (no gaming). I don’t need much storage but would like an SSD to mach my current computer with at least 256 GB. It would be nice if it lasted for at least four years. Desktop or laptop is fine too! 

Thanks for all your help!! Sorry if some of my assumptions about current Macs are unreasonable, I’m just going off what I’ve read and heard on ATP. Please correct me if you see something wrong.

**Update: **

You all are amazing! This is such useful advice. Need to get back to work but will get online again soon. And I’ll be keeping my ThinkPad just in case, we’ve been through a lot :).

**Update update: **

Alrighty, I couldn’t focus on work so I took the plunge.

I ended up getting the refurbished [2018 13” MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FR9U2LL/A/Refurbished-133-inch-MacBook-Pro-23GHz-quad-core-Intel-Core-i5-with-Retina-display-Silver?fnode=dda45df7e553a5984a04aa4572fd3b1baade5ed4849491102229e835586579fc5fef508436c0d2947b2f61cfe583eb5c409219c2f41684e8b84e8ca67688e56b90e1d06c3d195d409a9e077180e49b8a) suggested by WinterCharm (thank you!).

This whole discussion was very helpful. I agree with many people that this may not be the ideal time to switch. But I think the overall opinions suggest that, while I should be careful with the keyboard, the stuck key issue may be less of a concern. 

I should have been more clear about my other reasons for switching to Mac. I really like the idea of syncing with my iPhone. There is also software like OmniFocus that just isn’t available for PC. Lenovo and Dell are putting up a pretty decent ultrabook fight regardless. For sure I could dual boot one of them and have done that with my ThinkPad, but at this time in my life I really appreciate simplicity.

apple,I think that iCloud Shared Albums are one of iOS’s most underrated features.,"I love iCloud Shared Albums for a few reason. The first one is: the photos and or videos you upload don’t count against your iCloud storage. Theoretically it could be fully used as an photo backup service for up to 5,000 photos. It can be used to store photos that you want to keep for later, but don’t want using up device storage. I currently have a album full of memes and funny videos which would easily eat up a few GB on my phone. Another reason I love these albums are that they are baked into the photos app, and are incredibly easy to access and invite other people too. Other people can add to your collection making it that much more diverse and vast. I have a wallpaper and meme album that me and other friends are constantly updating and it’s very cool.  Everyone who I’ve asked to be part of these shared albums had no idea about this feature before I told them about it, and it kind of sucks that so many people seem to be unaware of this amazing feature that’s completely free! One thing I almost forgot about is that you can also make any album public so that even people who don’t have a device running iOS or MacOS can access it!",248,1442,2019-01-20,AAPL,0.022626392543315887,0.9401428699493408,0.037230730056762695

apple,I absolutely love the butterfly keyboard on the new MacBook Air.,"I bought the new MacBook Air a few days ago to try it out after returning the 11-inch iPad Pro. I avoided getting it in the first place because I was worried about the two most common complaints I had seen here in this sub and in review videos I had watched: The shitty butterfly keyboard and the crappy backlight in the display.

I'm still within my return period, and I'm genuinely trying to find reasons to convince myself that the keyboard isn't good. I'm in grad school, so I use my computers to type a lot, and this is seriously one of the smoothest and most comfortable keyboards I've ever used.

The backlight is demonstrably less powerful than other MacBooks, but I haven't been in a situation yet where it caused any problems.

I've also been following the threads recently about manufacturing errors leading to faulty keyboards. That's something I am mindful of while I consider whether or not I want to keep this product.

Anyway, I'm going to using the thing as much as possible before the return window ends to decide whether or not I like it, but I'm not sure I agree with all the people who talk about this like it's the worst keyboard ever.",442,1154,2019-01-21,AAPL,0.2904733717441559,0.6803838610649109,0.02914278581738472

mac,Is It Time to Call The Butterfly Switch Keyboard an Engineering Failure?,"Class Action lawsuit or demand Apple grant extended warranties to cover the keyboard. 

About a year ago my neighbor asked my opinion on purchasing a new MacBook. I told her I couldn’t recommend them on the basis of a problematic keyboard mechanism and now issues with dust being trapped behind the screen and showing through. 

Fast forward to yesterday afternoon and we’re at another neighbor’s football party.  She sheepishly walks over to me and says,  “I should have taken your advice, Shadow. My keyboard spacebar doesn’t work from time to time and occasionally I get double characters. I’m taking it to the Apple store Tuesday but my Apple warranty expires later this year.” 


This is the revised keyboard with the membrane and still, maddening failures.  3 years in and Apple still cannot get this right? It’s not even splash-proof / water resistant! All the people who killed their unibody Macs with a thimble of water on the keyboard (myself included), you think Apple would have improved the design for 2016.

apple,I Fought Apple and Won.,"I purchased an iPhone XS in September of last year. The first week of December I accidentally dropped it in my sisters swimming pool at the shallow end - a depth of approximately 1.10m. Immediately, I jumped in an pulled the phone out, switched it off and let it dry for a few hours (as indicated in the steps of what to do when your phone gets wet on the Apple website). A few hours later I turned the phone back on and all was good. Fantastic! 

A few weeks later, the Sunday before Christmas, my phone started bugging out restarting itself every 3-5 minutes. I restore it to an old backup from June 2018 to no avail, I restored it as a new iPhone which seemed to work. 

Jump forward 4 days and it starts happening again. I go through the process once more. It seems to be working fine for now. I was at my parents place for a week over Christmas so I wasn’t able to get to an Apple store until around the 29th. 

I went in and explained what happened to the genius tech, told her that it seems to be working fine now though. She agreed it may have just been a software issue, but made a case note so if it happened again then they would know it’s got a history. 

Jump forward another 2 weeks and it starts happening again, this time worse. The restarting is less frequent, maybe once every 8 minutes, but the screen is flickering from bright green to dark green. I take it back to Apple and they say they need to open it up and see if there is any internal damage. 

Two hours later I come back and they say the Liquid Contact Indicators have been activated, which means there is internal liquid damage and they won’t cover liquid damage under warranty. 

I spoke with the store manager on duty for about 45 minutes because I disagreed with this policy given Phil Schiller, head of worldwide marketing for Apple, literally said [you can drop it in the pool and it will be fine (jump to 40:40)](https://youtu.be/wFTmQ27S7OQ). It was not fine. This was the only time my phone had been in or near water. 

I continued the conversation with the store duty manager and she said the best she can do is take 25% off the replacement handset price of AUD$800 (or close to it). I was not about to pay an additional $600 for my phone after paying $1600 for it not too long ago. 

She gave me a few other options but the outcome of those would most likely be no replacement due to liquid damage. 

I was completely honest with her and said “I understand this isn’t  you making the policy, but I feel misled and like there is a bit of false advertising going on here. You can’t just make a statement and then choose not to cover it under warranty” she apologised again and I said that’s fine, I understand it’s not her. I told her I would be filing a complaint with NSW Fair Trading (consumer protection department in my state) because of the misleading statements made by Apple. She said that’s good and she hopes I get the outcome I want. 

I file the complaint. It goes to a complaints and compliance officer named Sharron (thanks, Sharron!). I spoke with Sharon today and she told me Apple Australia passed her through 6 different people before the complaint ended up on the desk of the Vice President of Executive Relations at Apple Australia. This woman conceded in agreeing to replace my phone at no additional charge. 

Sharron said that in situations like this large companies will replace the item in the hopes that the consumer won’t make a scene. But I’m making a scene, because I beat Apple and their shitty selective warranty clauses. 

I’m glad Australia has strong consumer protections laws that we have because there is no way in hell I would be paying an addition $600 for my phone. No phone is worth AUD$2200. 

And for any other Australians here who feel like they’ve been slighted by Apple and their selective warranty clauses then I suggest you gather your evidence and lodge an official complaint. 

**edit** 
I have no ill will towards Apple. I love their products. I have a Watch, an iMac, a MacBook Pro, Apple TV, and a very old unused iPad. 

I just didn’t agree with their bullshit policy. Don’t make a claim if you aren’t going to cover it when things go wrong. Yes, I understand that the seal can degrade over time, but 6 weeks? Come on. 

**double edit**
All of you commenting and private messaging me saying

&gt;&gt; it’s water-resistant not water-proof. 

Cool. Thanks. I fucking get it. Did I once say I thought my phone was water-proof? No. I understand IP ratings are for resistance levels not proofing levels. 

The whole crux of my argument is that the WORLDWIDE HEAD OF MARKETING FOR APPLE said “dropped your phone in the pool? No problem just pull it out and it’s ok” 

They claim water-**resistance** for up to 2m for 30 minutes.

Move along. 

**triple edit**
This blew up far bigger than I had ever anticipated it would. 

Everyone messaging me telling me I’m a crying baby, a moron, a dickhead who doesn’t know when to back down, and whatever else, please keep it coming. You fuel my internal fire for justice and vindication. 

The simple fact is that Apple have claimed in their advertising and through public statements by their senior executive staff that the phone can withstand the conditions my phone experienced. 

Now, was my phone defective since leaving this factory? Who knows. If so, I can accept that this is a very rare occurrence, and happily take my replacement. 

Did I some how break the *internal* water seal in the 6 weeks I owned the phone which then caused this problem? Who knows, maybe. If that *is* what has happened here then Apple need to look at how they’re sealing the phones so something as simple as everyday use of the phone doesn’t cause the seal to be breached as easily. 

**quadruple edit**
Thanks for the gold everyone. I don’t need it. Donate to a charity. 

Everyone saying I’m an idiot for continuing to buy Apple products, I’ll have you know I have had zero warranty issues with Apple previously. If I have ever needed something replaced or repaired they have always covered me for no additional cost (even without Apple Care).

apple,"Tim Cook today announced a #ShotOniPhone challenge - here are my thoughts, as a professional photographer.","Link to the new #ShotoniPhone challenge: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/share-your-best-photos-shot-on-iphone/  

Dear Apple/Tim Cook , if you want to use photos for an entire year in an ad campaign to sell more iPhones, you should be offering prize $ to the 10 winners, not photo credit in exchange for exclusive commercial ownership.

As a professional photographer having dealt with plenty of copyright infringement cases, I believe the terms Apple says you agree to by submitting your photos to this ""challenge"" are devious &amp; have a lot of room for improvement. There are ways for this to be mutually beneficial.

This ""challenge"" Apple calls it, is clearly aimed at amassing a collection of photos taken with their products and using those photos for a 'Shot on iPhone' campaign...to sell more products. (and make more $, lots more $)

Reading the fine print, Apple says: ""You retain your rights to your photograph; however, by submitting your photo, you grant Apple a royalty-free, world-wide, irrevocable, non-exclusive license for one year to use, modify, publish, display, distribute, create derivative works from and reproduce the photo on Apple Newsroom, apple . com, Twitter, Instagram, in Apple retail stores, Weibo, WeChat, on billboards and any Apple internal exhibitions. Any photograph reproduced will include a photographer credit.""

That's a big 'however' there.

Regarding the above section of these terms, I believe prize money should be offered for the amount of advertising these ten winning photographs will appear in.

Heck, a photo alone will likely entice someone to buy an iPhone. (for example: ""I wanna take photos like THAT!!"")

On that note, Apple sold 217 million iPhones (~6 per second) in 2018 with profit margins well north of 60%.
In some cases, profit margins are as much as 200%. (iPhone Xs)

But lets assume a modest 60% profit and a $999 phone: that's $130 billion (yes B) in profit.

Now, don't get me wrong. I use a MacBook Pro, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch daily. I am engrained in the ecosystem.

I just think Apple should rethink their strategy for this ""challenge"" because ""photographer credit"" never paid any of my bills.

Apple goes on to say: ""If your photo is selected to be featured on a billboard, you further agree to grant Apple exclusive commercial use of the photo for the life of the license.""

Without notice, for a year, Apple can revoke your right to earn a dime on your submitted photo(s).

Apple might as well not say: ""You retain your rights to your photograph.""

Apple will distribute the photo worldwide and make it the face of the campaign after a year.

Even if this isn't aimed at pros, I believe offering the winners each $10,000 would be chump change to what their images will do to help iPhone sales.

It would take Apple about 150 customers to see these ten images buy an iPhone as a result of it to break even on that $100,000.

Some of my favorite photos are taken on an iPhone and I'd love to submit them. But until the terms are adjusted I just can't give up rights to photos planned to be used so widely &amp; have so much money made from their use.

Would love to hear what you think about this, Tim.",406,1992,2019-01-23,AAPL,0.054117411375045776,0.9159038066864014,0.029978768900036812

Usually I use my phone to get through the ticket barriers for my morning commute, but since I’ve got my watch I’ve been using that too, depending on whether I have my phone in my hand at the time etc.
I just checked my bank balance and found huge charges of £16.40 a day for what should be a £7 total commute. Turns out then when I touch on with my phone but touch off with my watch,or vice versa, it counts it as two separate journeys, and counts both journeys as incomplete, thus charging the maximum fare for each. It’s cost me about 70 quid to get to and from work in the past week. I’ve disputed the charges and the guy on the phone said it’s something that happens quite often, so just a shout out to anyone who lives in London, make sure you’re using the same device or card to touch in and out!",64,624,2019-01-24,AAPL,0.041849374771118164,0.9269282817840576,0.031222324818372726

## Why Comet?

Comet focuses on delivering a streamlined Reddit experience with just the right amount of information on every screen. I think the intuitive interface and beautiful designs (Courtesy of /u/CiaranRobrien) really make Comet a fun way to browse reddit. 

But honestly with so many great Reddit clients on the AppStore I really think you need to try Comet to see if it's a good fit for you.

## How Much Will It Cost?

*Nothing*. The app is free with no ads! I don’t plan to change this, I may add a tip jar or a couple paid themes/icons in the future, but no existing or future features will be paywalled. 

## Do you plan to continue working on Comet?

Yes! Same schedule as I did in beta, new update for beta testers every two weeks (Since beta launch there have been 12 major updates). I haven’t decided how often the App Store will get updated but it will probably vary based on the each update’s content. 

&amp;nbsp;

Hope you enjoy Comet, happy redditing!

apple,Why doesn’t Apple make the iPhone with 128 GB storage anymore?,"In the new iPhones, there is no 128 GB variant (excluding XR). [iPhone XS and XS Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/specs/), iPhone X and [iPhone 8](https://www.apple.com/iphone-8/specs/) don’t have 128 GB storage variant. The storage options start at 64 GB which is obviously not enough for a lot of people, and the next available storage option is 256 GB, which is very expensive, and a lot of people can not afford it. People end up buying 64 GB variant of the iPhones and run out of storage very soon. The “storage almost full” pop-up warning has been a meme in the past. Even Google has [used](https://youtu.be/zpLVsR8cSFo?t=48) that meme in marketing its Pixel 2 phone with unlimited cloud storage for photos.

128 GB variant would be so perfect for a lot of people. I don’t know why Apple stopped making them. When the [iPhone XR](https://www.apple.com/iphone-xr/specs/) has a 128 GB variant, why can’t the other models have the same perfect 128 GB option? It is same as the new [iPad pros](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/). They don’t have the 128 GB variant either. Maybe Apple wants to promote their iCloud service by selling the less storage iPhone variant and make people buy its cloud storage! It’s a burden to buy the iCloud storage after buying an already expensive phone. In the case of 256 GB version they make money from the price of the phone, so it is a win-win situation for them. At the end of the day, users can benefit from the 128 GB variant.

So, Apple, can we please have the 128 GB variant back again? Hope you make a 128 GB iPhone this year (fingers crossed).",691,2068,2019-01-26,AAPL,0.05787375196814537,0.9110300540924072,0.031096190214157104

apple,I paid $5000 for a top of the line Macbook Pro and it's utterly useless because it cannot keep it self cooled down,"I'm really disappointed in Apple for this and sadly I will never buy another Macbook Pro after seeing what they've done with the latest version's cooling issues. This is insane. What's the point of having a monster CPU if it's clocked down to 1GHz a majority of the time?

I can't help but feel a bit ripped off. I've been an apple fan forever and loved my old Macbook, and the 2 others before- that's why I figured I'd get another one when I needed something with better performance.

* 15"" 2018 Macbook Pro
* High Sierra 10.13.6
* 2.9 GHz i9
* 32gb RAM
* Radeon 560X

I do a lot of dev work which involves running many processes at once and compiling a lot of code. I'd say I really stress this laptop, but the issue is after just a few minutes of my normal applications running, I notice this horrible lag everywhere.

Finally I installed the Intel Power Gadget tool and found the CPU is stuck throttled to 1 GHz most of the time: https://imgur.com/a/pX7wLd5

After sticking it in the freezer for a few minutes, everything runs smooth again when the frequency isn't being throttled:
https://imgur.com/a/m7XU9Gc

So my dilema is I've already sunk $5k into this work laptop and I'm stuck with it as I'm months outside of the return window. Is there any hope to fix this? Or is my only option to just sell it and buy something else that can keep itself cool?

My advice to anyone looking at a new Macbook Pro as a monster work laptop- don't do it. No sense in paying for specs you'll never be able to actually use.


**UPDATE:**

I updated to 10.14.3, issue has persisted: https://imgur.com/a/I4eP05j
Definitely bummed out as I thought there was hope.

**EDIT 1:** The temperature seems to spike when I have my 2 monitors plugged in and is much better without them. I'm leaning more towards the GPU causing it to tip over the edge on temperatures now. An eGPU as /u/cronin1024 pointed out could help alleviate it but still frustrating that I have to pay more money just to fix a serious design flaw.

When these alarms inevitably wake you (but not them) from your much needed rest, you can take your iPhone (positioned handily within reach) and FaceTime their iCloud account for a brief couple of rings.

apple,Do some of you miss TouchID?,"I have an iPhone X. Very nice looking phone. My previous phone was a 6 Plus. The X is an amazing phone, the screen blows me away. But after over a year of use I still miss TouchID.

TouchID was so easy and worked 99% of the time for me. So easy to unlock with one hand. Unlock without looking. Unlock at weird angles. 

For me FaceID is way more work and much more inconvenent and slower. It requires my attention. And does not work in many situations when the phone isn't upright.

For example my car has car play. And some times it requires me to unlock the phone. But the phone does not have a direct view of my face where it is docked. So I have to enter the passcode. What a pain. 

Am I the only one?",1536,5909,2019-01-31,AAPL,0.04647953435778618,0.9218408465385437,0.031679607927799225
