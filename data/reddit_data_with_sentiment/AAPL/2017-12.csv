apple,I've been on Android for 9 years and finally got an iPhone. My thoughts after 2 weeks...,"I’ve been exclusively using Android for 9 years, since the HTC HD2 release in 2009. I recently bought the iPhone X because I found the hardware offerings on Android incredibly compromised this year and I need to upgrade my old phone. I would have gotten the Note 8 but I swore-off Samsung 4 years ago and I won’t be going back any time soon.

After 2 weeks of using the iPhone X, here’s my pros and cons of the new iPhone and of iOS in general. Sorry, it's a long one.

## Hardware
#### Pros
- The thing just feels incredible to hold. I’ve never held a phone quite like it, it’s a very solid and beautifully designed phone. It’s a real shame to put it in a case, but the Apple leather Case happens to be the best case I've ever owned, the metal buttons are a nice touch.
- The notch is not a big deal at all, and I’ve actually grown quite fond of it. Apps that support it look awesome.
- I appreciate the way Apple cares about the small details, especially on fundamental things like the way buttons feel or even the vibration motor - so many phones get it wrong and you end up missing calls and messages because they use a petty little motor that you can’t feel in your pocket. The iPhone’s vibration/haptic motor is absolutely perfect, I never miss calls or notifications. 
- The silence switch is super useful, more phones should have it.
- For some reason 3D touch makes the phone feel really premium to me. I think it’s because there’s this extra layer of control you get that doesn’t exist on anything else, and it has a lot of utility.
- The Camera is amazing. Great dynamic range, accurate colours, plenty of details, and finally the iPhone can handle low light situations, something I’ve noticed previous iPhone’s are terrible at compared to the competition. Here’s a [couple of photos](https://imgur.com/a/fTzIx) from last weekend - I think I took them in square mode? I’m still figuring the camera app out, but I like the features it bundles a lot.
- The microphone quality is excellent in videos, when I compare it to my previous phones it blew them out of the water. Though I haven’t tried it in loud situations yet.
- AirPods… holy cow they are incredible. To me, they are a legitimate reason to buy the iPhone, they are that good. I think Apple is at least another 1-2 years ahead of the competition with AirPods. 
- Battery life started off bad, but is pretty good now. Not amazing, but good. I end up on 40% most nights at 12pm after unplugging the phone at 7.30am. My Nexus 6P used to be dead by 3pm, so that’s been nice.
- Touch latency feels amazing, something iPhones have always been good with. I just wish it was a 120hz/Pro motion display :(

#### Cons
* Lack of USB-C is stupid in my opinion. It was really useful being able to carry one charger on trips to charge my Macbook and my Phone.
* Although I don’t mind the Notch overall, it makes the landscape experience crappy. Videos are either heavily letter boxed, or if you zoom to fill the screen it cuts out the top and bottom of the frame AND the notch sits over the edge.
* The charger in the box is extremely slow which can be annoying. But if it puts less strain on the battery compared to using a fast charger, I’m okay with it.
- The camera is a bit slow with HDR on. A lot of my photos have turned out blurry because I like to keep HDR on.

#### Other
- Some people will say no LED notification light is a con, but I always found it distracting and unnecessary.  I disable as many notifications as I possible, I’m kind of militant about it. [This article](https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-your-push-notifications/) sums up my thoughts.

## Software
#### Pros
* I really like iOS so far. I enjoy the design, it feels very user friendly, modern and fluid, it gets out of the way for the most part. I’ve seen a lot of negativity here about iOS 11, but I haven’t had any issues. At a high level I really appreciate how well designed and coherent iOS is compared to Android due to Apple’s stringent human interface guidelines. As a designer, I cannot stand UX and UI inconsistency, and Android is in a pretty ugly state right now with its app experiences varying between Google apps, the amount of duplicate apps they have (e.g. messaging), and they can’t even get the little details right, like icons - Androids icons are a joke.
* iPhone 3rd party apps are just better. On Android I always felt like a second class citizen because many developers tend to favour iOS before Android, we’d have to wait for iOS exclusive apps to come out on Android, or wait longer for updates to come through, often Google will even update iOS apps before Android gets them.
- Face ID was one of the factors that persuaded me _away_ from this phone initially, but I really enjoy it now. I do find it a little inconvenient when the phone is on my desk and I kind of have to learn over it to unlock it, but otherwise it just works really well and feels effortless.
- Something I didn’t expect, Apple lets you uninstall a lot of the pre-installed iOS apps. On Android there are very fews apps you can uninstall, some allow you to disable them. Oh, and no bloatware or duplicate apps! I owned two Samsung phones and they both had 5-15 Samsung apps that do the exact same thing as the apps already bundled in Android. Don’t get me started on carrier bloatware.
- Apple Pay works as advertised. It feels kind of weird paying for things with my face. I will note that Apple Pay and Android Pay seem to be right on parity, they look and feel very similar.
- Control center is really good, maybe even more useful than Androids quick settings with the use of force touch on the various panels.
- As an Android user I naturally enjoy the lack of a physical home button. Even better is the gesture navigation, I love it and it feels totally natural now - I keep trying to use the gestures on my Nexus and being disappointed that they don’t work.
- Minor, but this is the first phone I’ve used where auto-brightness is pretty damn good, I rarely need to manually adjust it, which is saying something because I’m a massive brightness control freak.
- Airdrop rocks. It’s simply the best file sharing experience period. Android has PushBullet, and it’s unreliable, and it need to upload your files to a server, then download it on the recipient device, it’s stupid.
- Night shift is wonderful. I had this feature on my Nexus for about 4 months, and then Google went and disabled it one day so I had to rely on garbage 3rd party options that don’t work properly. Nice.

#### Cons
- Safari has this “Share” icon right in the middle of the bottom nav bar. **Why** have Apple bundled actions like ‘find in page’ and ‘request desktop site’ in this share menu? It took me way too long to figure out how to find a word on a page.
- Notifications don’t come anywhere near Android’s notification system, but they aren’t _that_ bad. Good thing I disable most notifications anyway.
- You can’t make new folders locally in the files app? I wanted somewhere to store a few PDF files locally, but there’s no way to make a folder locally, only in iCloud. Seems like a fairly useless app to me.
- Some more ways to customise the home screen would be nice. e.g. Allowing you to move widgets out of their prison cell on the left and free to mingle with the app icons if a user wants.
- I cannot find a good Calendar app on iOS. Readdle’s Calendar app is the closest thing I can find to pure awesome that is Business Calendar on Android. I tried Fantastical, but didn’t like it. I just want a really powerful month view, and it doesn’t seem to exist on iPhone.
- Quite a few of the in built iOS apps just have awful UX. I haven’t used them all, but the podcasts app in particular is downright baffling, I develop and design software for a living and I can barely figure out how to use that fucking app. I got the Apple Music 3 month trial and ended up trashing the app after an hour of being frustrated by bad the experience was. Google Play Music isn’t much better, but damn I rely on Youtube Red too much now.

#### Other
- I had high expectations for iMessage as there is _a lot_ of praise out there I had been hearing for years, but it’s really not that great in my opinion. There’s an infinite amount of other messaging competitors that ostensibly do the same thing. Also the confetti/lasers/etc messages are ridiculously pointless.
- Not a fan of True Tone. I want my whites to be white all the time, I don’t care about the environment I’m in, I just want colours to be consistent. But it can be turned off, so it’s not an issue for me.

    

    



**TL;DR**: Loving the iPhone X and iOS. The pros of switching from Android to iPhone have severely outweighed the cons for me. Very happy.

iphone,PSA: iPhone Reboot/Respring Issues Megathread,"**UPDATE: iOS 11.2 update is now available - it fixes the issue.**

**What's the issue?**

Lots of people on **iOS 11.1.2** *and maybe other versions* have been facing issues in the past 24 hours or so, suffering from reboots/bootloops after seconds or minutes of using their phone. *This issue may affect iPads as well (not confirmed).*

Technically this is actually a ""respring"" if you see a spinning circle rather than the Apple logo.

This means that Springboard (the home screen with all the icons) is reloading itself, but your entire phone remains switched on throughout. You will be prompted to enter your passcode again once Springboard has reloaded.

**Some possible solutions until Apple publishes a fix:**
*Force restart your phone after trying any of these as they may not work straight away. Remember different iPhones have different force restart methods.*

*iPhone 6/s and below: home + power*
*iPhone 7: volume down + power*
*iPhone 8/X: press then let go volume up, press and let go volume down, hold power.*

**- Senior Apple Support Reps are suggesting manually setting the date to 1 day before the problem started (thanks u/xyzeian). However, this is NOT recommended. You should be aware that an incorrect date/time can affect many other aspects of your phone. Read on for a better fix.**
*Apple Support is currently being flooded with calls about this; please don't ring unless you have a separate issue. Their engineering team is working on a fix.*

**UPDATE: If you have an app that has local notifications with repeating settings (this means apps that don't rely on a server in order to notify you, e.g. Headspace, Calm, or any other apps that use notifications that work on airplane mode) it will crash iOS Springboard, commencing Dec. 2 @ 12:15am. Disabling notifications for these apps may fix your issue.**

**UPDATE 2: Don’t turn back the date. Many server calls will fail which means websites won’t load correctly or at all, apps may not update or launch (twitter, whatsapp) and calendar events, reminders, and messages won’t work.**

**Best viable workaround is to turn off third-party notifications. If you’re not sure which apps employ local, repeating notifications, turn them all off.**

**The soon-to-be released iOS 11.2 has already fixed this issue.**
*You can update to the beta, but it's recommended that you wait until Apple publishes a public iOS update, which will inevitably happen soon.*

**If you cannot disable your notifications, then temporarily roll back your date and time to 1 week ago, this will enable you to disable your notifications and then you can return to the current date and time without glitches.**

- Changing your timezone to Honolulu, or changing your date and time to 1 week ago may temporarily fix the issue. It seems like the issue may be based on or linked to your system clock.

- Some people have reported that deleting the Headspace app (if you have it installed) will solve this issue. However, there are plenty of people that never had the app and are still facing the issue so this may not work. *I have contacted Headspace support; I will update this post when I hear back.*

- Disable Background App Refresh (Settings &gt; General)

- Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset &gt; Reset All Settings (use as last resort, or just wait for a fix and play outside)

**Other recommendations:**

- Make a full backup of your device via iTunes. If your phone is doing a RESPRING, not a reboot, then you will be able to back up even whilst it resprings. Your phone is replaceable; your photos *aren't*.

- If your phone is getting too hot, switch it off completely to avoid any damage, and keep an eye on this thread for a possible fix


**What DOESN'T work (according to user reports):**

- Hard reset by holding Power + Home button: doesn't fix the problem

- Reinstall apps: doesn't fix the problem

- Restart the phone: doesn't fix the problem",257,804,2017-12-02,AAPL,0.0802093967795372,0.8906509280204773,0.029139729216694832

apple,Trying to make sense of faceID vs one plus 5T face recognition reviews.,"This how reviewers compared faceID on the X and facial recognition on the one plus 5T.

Apple: ""we use infrared which can work in dark"" -&gt; Reviewers : “Lets test it in dark, in sun and maybe even under different types of light”

One plus : ""we use RGB camera"" -&gt; Reviewers : “It works for me most of the time”. I guess testing in the dark is not needed now.

Apple: “we use 30000 points plus 3D image” -&gt; Reviewers : “lets uses masks, twins and everything else we can think of”

One plus says “100 points of data and a 2D image” -&gt; Reviewers : “it doesnt work with a pic, so it must be secure.”

Apple : ""2D images are deleted immediately and 3D data is hashed and is in secure enclave"" -&gt; Reviewers : ”we are still worried and not sure about privacy issues“‘

One plus says, well nothing -&gt; Reviewers are like, privacy? what is that? I have heard that word somewhere.

Apple : ""we ditched toucID"" -&gt; Reviewers : ”well now the damn thing doesnt work on a desk""

One plus : ""fingerprint sensor on the back"" -&gt; Reviewers “well it has fingerprint sensor, so it convenient in every case faceID doesn’t work” . I guess people dont keep their one plus devices on the desk.

I really cannot make sense of how reviewers come up with such reviews (im not sure whether I can call these reviews at this point). Granted the X is super expensive (I personally find it hard to recommend to normal users at that price). And I personally believe one plus is a more value buy. But if you are comparing two things then have the courtesy to do a fair review. Dont call yourselves unbiased and straightforward while pulling shit like this.

What is the argument to justify these reviewers? Is it that one plus is cheaper? So then someone who spends only a 500$ for the phone doesn’t deserve to be informed about what they are getting? Is the justification that one plus has a fingerprint sensor as backup? Well I hate to tell you this but your overall security is determined by the weakest link in the chain. 

With all that said the only logical conclusion that I can see as the reason for such a behaviour from reviewers is that videos about Apple, clickbaity titles like “faceID fails”, conspiracy theories like “maybe a layer of oil will break faceID” (Unbox therapy) gets you more views and more clicks.",216,663,2017-12-02,AAPL,0.07520897686481476,0.8973971009254456,0.027393905445933342

apple,Thoughts from a former Android user,"I've been an android user for the past 6 years, and the iPhone X is my first iPhone. 

&amp;nbsp;

    Hardware: 
Coming from old LG, HTC, and Samsung phones I can say that the iPhone X has the best build quality by far. I especially was pulled towards the iPhone X because it has a pretty big screen, but in a smaller form factor.

* The phone feels really good to hold and really premium. 

* The wireless charging I think is important since it'll be pushed quite a bit more in the near future. 

* No headphone jack isn't great, but I don't really use it much as it is, I think people get hung up on that point too much.
I don't think that lightning cable instead of USB C is that big of a deal either, but USB C would have been nice. 

* The device's buttons all feel great, and I actually really like the mute switch, I feel like more phones should have it. 

* The speakers on this phone are absolutely insane in comparison to most phones. The utilization of the earpiece as a speaker is really smart.

* The cameras on the front and back of this phone are really amazing. I'm very impressed with low light performance, and love the moving pictures IOS takes.

* Call Quality is really good, and my voice sounds clear.

* I know the notch is love or hate for some people, but really I think its a good thing. I'd rather have the extra screen at the top than not at all. It feels like I have a full sized screen covering my phone, then I have important information displayed at all times at the top. My only gripe is that I want battery percentage up there in the battery icon.

&amp;nbsp;

    Software: 
As far as software went I was a little concerned I would be missing some Android features, but that's not really the case usually.

* My two favorite software features are the Voicemail and iMessage. 
Reading Voicemails has to be one of the coolest things ever, and now I don't want to go back. 

* Also iMessage is really amazing too. Texting from my computer is such an amazing convenience since I'm at my desk alot that I'm curious why other companies haven't found a good alternative to iMessage. (I also think texting money is really cool but its a new feature not utilized much yet)

* Phone navigation for me was probably my biggest concern. 
I thought it would be annoying not having the standard 3 on screen Android buttons. But I was completely wrong. The swipe home and multi-tasking I wasn't too worried about, but going back I thought was going to be really annoying. I'm really glad I was concerned over nothing, because once I figured out about swiping to go back I wondered why I ever pressed a button in the first place. For sure I can say that phone navigation on this thing is top notch, no pun intended.

* I think the Control Center and the Notification screen are alright, but could use work.

* The Control Center is nice, but I think that it should be more easily accessible with one hand. There is an option for accessibility, but I think the gesture could use some work, it's really hard to trigger. I'd also like to point out I don't like the Control Center and Notification page having different animations. 

* The Notification page... Ok if there's anything I like less about this phone than my old Android phones it has to be this. Please just give me an option to group my notifications, I don't need to see 20 discord messages or 30 twitter messages on my lock screen all individually. I wish it would group them by app so I could see that I have a text message without scrolling down 500 kilometers. 

&amp;nbsp;

    Apple's Apps and Services: 
I really don't have a whole lot to say about this so I'll be brief on this topic.

* Apple Wallet is great when it works. There isn't support everywhere, but I like the convenience.

* Apple Maps are better now, but honestly I still prefer Google Maps.

* I don't use the mail app, since all my email accounts are Gmail, so I just use that app.

* Ok, I didn't think I would use it, but the News App and it's corresponding widget I actually use alot. Good work Apple, I actually keep up with news now. lol

* Apple music I won't use since I prefer Spotify. 

* Siri is garbage, but I don't really like Google Assistant either. lol

All other Apple apps aren't worth mention for me because I just flat out don't use them. I still use stuff like Alarm clock, but every phone is pretty much equal on these things.

&amp;nbsp;

    Third Party Apps: 
Another brief section, but I really couldn't skip over it.


Third Party Apps on iPhone are pretty much exactly the same.
My one gripe though is when an App isn't optimized for iPhone X I die a little bit on the inside. I thought it wouldn't bother me, but when I'm holding my phone and about 25% of the screen isn't utilized it really hurts.

&amp;nbsp;

    Other Thoughts: 
Just little things I wanted to mention


* Long-Term Software support is amazing. I never had anything like that on Android. 

* Apple Support is really good. I had some issues with logging into iMessage and the customer support was very very good in comparison to almost any other customer support I've ever used.

* I don't really use 3D Touch, but I think its cool.

* People talk about OLED being on Android phones for years, and that's true, I've had OLED for many years now, but I actually think that this is the best screen I've ever used. It looks amazing, the colors are fantastic, and I love true tone.

* I got an Apple Leather case and can say its pretty great. The metal buttons are cool.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: iPhone X is amazing. I love the hardware, the software is also pretty good, but could use a little work. And Third Party Apps need to seriously step up their game.

If I had to rate this phone I'd give it a 9/10, I'd say the hardware is all there, but the software is still lagging behind a little bit. But this is by far the best phone I've ever used. 

I know this was a really long post and I don't know if it'll help anyone, but I think it might help Android users that are on the edge. 

I've also edited this a couple times for formatting to make it a little more structured. Thanks for reading.",201,1102,2017-12-06,AAPL,0.026458092033863068,0.9268108606338501,0.046731049194931984

apple,Touch ID vs. Face ID - Your opinion after 1 month of using the iPhone X,"After one month of using the iPhone X I thought it would be a good time to hear what early adopters think of the new authentication process compared to the old one. Which one do you prefer generally speaking?

Here's my opinion:

Although Face ID works great in most situations, even better than I had expected, it has its shortcomings. For me Touch ID is, generally speaking, the superior authentication method.
Here's why:

* Touch ID is faster, yeah it just is. If you think about the complexity of face id it's not really a surprise.
* Touch ID works in 99% of situations compared to maybe 98% for Face ID. The most frustrating is probably when looking at your phone in bed. Either your face is partly hidden or the phone is too close to your face. It seems to get better with time though and works pretty well for me currently. Another one is when the phone is on a desk, although it works pretty well at different angles, touch ID is just more convenient.

That being said Face ID has advantages over Touch ID:

* Looking at the lockscreen to show the notification preview is awesome
* In-App Face ID authentication (for passwords, logins, etc.) is superior to touch ID, no need to do anything.
* Wet fingers! 

Edit: Thanks everyone for the great feedback ! Looks like a majority favors Face ID",297,294,2017-12-06,AAPL,0.020556263625621796,0.8711012005805969,0.10834252089262009

iphone,PSA: iPhone slow? Try replacing your battery!,"Since this post has blown up like crazy since I made it, I’m going to revise it to make it more clear and provide a better explanation. This might make some comments outdated. The original post has been archived to pastebin [here.]( https://pastebin.com/JergYngQ)

First, I’ll start with Apple’s official statement on the matter:

&gt;	Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.

&gt;	Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.

Now let me clear a few things up.

Who does this affect?
iPhone 6, 6S, SE, and 7 users at the moment, but it will likely continue for all future iPhones until further notice. Something to note about the iPhone 7: with the A10 chip, it has low power and high power cores. The low power cores are used 90% of the time, and should stay at full speed, so you won’t notice any slowdown except in intensive programs such as benchmarks, demanding games, video editing, etc.

Am I affected?
Depending on the age of your phone and the amount of battery wear, maybe. You can check this for sure by using an app called CPUdasher X that is no longer free, now being $0.99. You can check this by scrolling down to CPU Frequency. The 6 is supposed to be 1400, the 6S 1848, and the 7 2350. As far as I know, there is NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE to this. You can, however, do a geek bench or Antutu test to tell you what your CPU score is compared to what it should be, but it won’t tell you your clock speed. 

How do I fix this?
You must replace your battery. You can do this in 3 ways:

1.	Do it yourself. You can buy a battery for $10-$20 and follow the guide on iFixit.com to repair your device. This WILL void you warranty, and Apple will not work on your device ever again, meaning all future repairs will have to be done by you. You have been warned.
2.	Take it to a 3rd party location, such as Experimac of Batteries + Bulbs. Anywhere is fine, but make sure they have a warranty, and check Apple’s pricing before you decide on the store. This will also void your warranty with Apple, and they will never repair it again. You have been warned.
3.	Take it to Apple. **Apple is charging only $29 for all of 2018** ~~They charge $79 for all devices,~~ and you can take it into an Apple store with another 1 year warranty after you leave.

I’m replacing my battery myself. How do I know what battery to buy?
Don’t EVER buy an unbranded battery. If it’s generic, it’s likely to be very low quality, and might not even fix the problem. If it has a name brand, it’s probably fine. I will keep a list of brands that work here and will update it whenever someone else lists that brand.

As for WHY this happens, it's because the battery degrades over time. The cells die, and the resistance increases, thereby not allowing for peak voltage for the processor. Without slowing down your phone, the phone would just shut off at random times, once your battery would fail to support your phone at peak processor usage. By introduces this slowdown, you can potentially keep using your phone for years as long as you're fine with a slow phone. Replacing the battery will fix this, and your phone will be back up to full speed.

If you are affected, I ask that you report your device model, Geekbench scores, battery voltage, and CPU clock speed if you can. It will help paint a clearer picture for the future.",1126,4582,2017-12-09,AAPL,0.09116630256175995,0.866209089756012,0.04262465611100197

apple,iPhone X turns everyone and everything orange,"Gallery link: https://imgur.com/a/9dUQV

Yesterday I tried to create a post about why I dislike the iPhone X camera, but it ended up an incoherent, overly dramatic wall of text, which simply wasn't enough to get my point across. Today I have collected various shots of people from reviews all over the internet to prove my point - this camera will give your face a fake tan the cast of Jersey Shore would be jealous of. While in some cases the look may make sense, it is simply very far from color accuracy when compared to actual professional photography tools and often creates a really unflattering look compared to real life (refer to shots #3 with the blonde girl). I have very pale skin myself and what this phone does to my skin simply makes me look unfamiliar to other people and to myself. My sister was really excited to check out my new iPhone X and when she got to taking photos all she could say was - oh... The raw image quality and detail the phone outputs sure is top tier, but I suspect for many people the end result could be worse than something you'd get out of an entry level smartphone thanks to the completely out of wack color calibration.

Enough rambling, check out the gallery which speaks for itself.",168,352,2017-12-10,AAPL,0.032274093478918076,0.919913649559021,0.04781229794025421
apple,Every day my iPhone becomes unusable for a couple of minutes because of spam calls. There is no need for an incoming call to block access to the rest of the phone in 2017.,"This really grinds my gear. I will be doing some really important work and an incoming call (which I cannot or should not pick up) interrupts my workflow and I can't do anything about it. 

Generally, 99.99% of calls from unknown numbers are spam calls which I should not pick up. If I pick up, I will get a barrage of calls for the next few hours, days and will probably last for a month. I cannot even decline a call since that also causes an uptick in number of spam calls for the next few minutes and hours. They'll just keep on continuously calling. My phone is practically useless during this time.

I have been able to deal with this somewhat by creating a ""spam"" contact and blocking it but sometimes even that is not enough. It becomes a race against time. I will be racing to add the number to the ""spam"" contact but they will keep on calling. Again and Again and Again.

I just want to throw out my 6S out of the window these days.

TLR; Apple refuses to understand that not all calls are important and it's not always a binary decision between accepting and declining. Sometimes you have to let the calls ring through to avoid the consequences.

**EDIT** - Many people are misinterpreting my desire to continue using my phone during an incoming call with ""apple should help me block spam."" I am not asking for that because I know it's difficult and every region has it's own nuances. Not one size fits all. What flies in the US for blocking spam calls may or may not work Europe or Asia. All I demand is -  **please do not let anyone else decide if I can use my phone or not for other stuff just by making a simple call to my number**

**EDIT 2** - People are still conflating the spam issue with the problems of the phone app. I was just using spam to illustrate the point that how one of the most modern and expensive devices on the market used by millions around the world for purposes much more than its predecessors stops and drops everything it's doing if it gets a call.

When the race started, I was using the official marathon app that was pretty inaccurate while using Apple maps to navigate us. Unfortunately, the GPS routes that were calculated didn’t take the blocked roads into account so turn by turn was not the most effective. 

Turns out, Google Maps had the marathon accounted for. They laid down the entire path that both the half and full marathon runners take. And the GPS drew routes that didn’t cross over that trail! I was hugely impressed with that.

So I spent the day using Google Maps. Too bad Apple Maps couldn’t deliver on that front. Looking forward to Apple Maps improving more and more in the future",244,491,2017-12-11,AAPL,0.04382961243391037,0.9034292697906494,0.05274112895131111

apple,Customer made for life,"I recently got the iPhone X, making the jump from Android because what the hell, why not? So far I’ve been enjoying the X immensely, but I developed a hairline crack on the screen. I didn’t know where it came from.

So, I went to the Apple Store near me and inquired. They set up an appointment with the Genius Bar, and ten minutes later (despite a long wait schedule) I was in front of a guy. He explains that it is a scratch and thus user fault, but he went in to confirm. He came back saying that it was definitely a scratch but he’ll throw it under the warranty just for my sake. He was super cool about it.

So, I come 2 hours later to pick up the repaired phone, only to find out that they had run out of the repair parts at the local facility. I was like, “man, now they’re going to have to ship it out for a repair”. Nope. They replace the phone with a brand new one, right out the box. 

So now I’m walking out with a fresh X that costed me exactly nada. The process was fast and the reps were amazing.

apple,Sold my Fuji mirrorless camera and booked a trip to Shanghai and Seoul. Shot only with my iPhone X and couldn't be happier with the results.,"Hi guys,

Ive been shooting with a DSLR for about 3 years and a Mirrorless (Fuji xt1 + xt2) for about 2. Even with the mirrorless, I found the thing to much of a hassle to bring around with me everywhere. Both cameras were also super overkill for the travel photography I was interesting in shooting. All I ever really did was post on instagram and on Squarespace now and then. I do not plan on making a dime from my photographs nor do I want to. 

When the iPhone X came out I was absolutely in love with the device and started to wonder if the iPhone was capable of being my main shooter. I asked around on a few subreddits and 9/10 times people were in favor of the Fuji xt-2. Clearly, the mirrorless is better than the iPhone X. However, I don't think it was that much better in my case to warrant keeping a $2,000 dollar camera and hauling it around with me.

I sold the camera and used that money to book a flight to Shanghai and then Seoul. 

Here are the pictures I took - www.phaotos.com 

At first, I was super nervous about how I booked a trip with the sole intentions of taking pictures and I didn't even have a good camera to capture these moments with. I was quickly proved wrong and was loving the images I was getting with the iPhone X. 

All of these images are edited in VSCO cam. I own all of the packs and am a VSCO X member. However, I 80% of the time use A6. Also, starting to use the iPhone's exposure setting significantly improved my shots. 

I dont think selling a mirrorless camera for an iPhone is a good idea for everyone. But I'm glad I did it. I would def keep a DSLR or Mirrorless if you take photography a bit more seriously than I do. 

Enjoy :-)",112,557,2017-12-17,AAPL,0.02329375222325325,0.91523677110672,0.061469532549381256

The app was not made by StudioMDHR, is glitchy and doesn't play right. It seems that someone may have taken the assets from the full game and patched together a semi functional port for iOS. They even took the time to put up a fake site (http://studiomdhrgames.com).


Avoid buying this game, and if you did ask for a refund. And shame on Apple for dropping the ball like this...

apple,Found iPhone X!,"Hi All!

I am not familiar with Apple products nor what is or is not possible.

After parking at the mall I got out of my car, looked down and saw a small Louis Vuitton item. I bent down, picked it up, realized it was a cell phone, opened it up and then realized that it was an iPhone X.

I brought it to the Apple store waited about 20 minutes for someone to help me, was passed off to three different people, each one did something to the phone, but as it was locked, were unable to do anything.

Finally the third person told me that he is entirely too busy to deal with this and honestly there is not much that can be done and if I want to keep it, it is essentially a very fancy paper weight.

Otherwise, he would take it and it would probably just sit in the back and be forgotten about.

I took it back and would love to return it to it's rightfully owner. I was hoping that the owner would call it, to date a little less than 24h that has not happened.

I borrowed a colleague's extra USB charging cable to keep it charged just in case the owner or a friend calls on it.

Do you all have any other suggestions as to what I can do?

Oh and I did stop by Mall Lost and Found and nobody was there and I couldn't wait any longer, I called them when I got home and they said they have over 200 iPhones just from this year and leaving it with them would be almost useless, they suggested the Apple Store.

**UPDATE #: 1**
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


My apologies for not being able to reply, we have a six car Motor Vehicle Accident and was operating non-stop since the patients came in. 
&amp;nbsp;

I called the local Verizon Store and spoke with the Manager and she said to bring the phone in tonight or tomorrow and she would help me out and attempt to reunite the phone with its right owner.


**UPDATE #: 2**

Sorry, was a crazy day, was unable to update with the final outcome.

I went to the Verizon store last night and the Manager removed the SIM and inserted it in another handset, dialed the store, obtained the number and looked up the account in the computer.

She explained to me that she would be unable to provide me any info but could give the account holder my info and I could arrange with the account holder to hand over the phone.

Luckily, there was a second phone on the account and she called the number, but left a voicemail explaining that someone found the iPhone X registered to the account and to call the store to discuss further.

This afternoon she called me that the main account holder did call her back and she gave him my contact info.

I spoke to the iPhone X's husband, apparently the iPhone X was a gift to his wife and she was embarrassed that she lost the phone after only three days of ownership.

The husband was on a work trip and she only admitted to loosing the phone yesterday as she was so embarrassed. He arranged with me to hand over the phone tomorrow after he returns from his work trip.",223,542,2017-12-21,AAPL,0.06058745086193085,0.9058624505996704,0.033550091087818146

apple,I went to the Apple store after seeing my Geekbench results. Paid $79 and it worked.,"Just another user here confirming. Geekbench currently shows 2254 single core for iPhone 6s on their official benchmark. I did some tests last night and my phone showed 14xx or 18xx. 

Went to Apple store this morning. The rep confirmed that my battery has 83% of its original capacity. I asked for a replacement anyway.

It’s all done now. Ran a test just now and my single core performance is now 25xx. It’s scary that my original battery had more than 80% of its original capacity, but I was being throttled disproportionally. 

And contrary to everyone saying you won’t notice during day to day. You absolutely can notice it, especially during usage of heavy apps.

-----------------------------------------

edit: /u/WastedCyberspace asked a good question and I figured I should include it in the top post. 

If you had an Apple Store rep run battery diagnostic before, you'll know that the result comes back with a red, yellow, and green rectangle formation thingie. Because my battery still had 83% of its original capacity, it was technically ""healthy"", ie in the green box on their diagnostic result.

Basically Apple's own diagnostic considers the battery ""healthy"". And my peak frequency was still throttled by more than 30%.",583,1840,2017-12-22,AAPL,0.027053046971559525,0.9024453163146973,0.0705016478896141

It seems pretty clear to me that they *did* disclose it. Others have pointed out that they also made press statements and had briefings about the update. As well as telling you in the Battery section of the Settings app that your battery needs to be serviced.

It's absolutely untrue that they didn't tell anyone. You could make reasonable arguments that they should have sent push notifications or something more aggressive to come in for a battery replacement, but I think we all know that would have been this x10 in controversy.

I can't help but think how fake concernish all this outrage feels from an ostensibly technically savvy audience. Did you know that when iOS says your battery is at 100% it is actually lying to you? Did you know when you open an app on iOS it shows you a screenshot of the last state to give you the impression that its opening quickly while it loads in the background? Where's the outrage?

apple,Battery Scientist weighing in on this issue of throttling,"I've seen a lot of posts and comments on how outrageous it is to be throttling a battery while it still has 80 % of its capacity. I can speak from a scientific background, and I'd like to try and clarify some things, and hopefully lower your pitchforks slightly.

Batteries don't really work in the range of what we would consider to be healthy. With posts like [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7lkdur/i_went_to_the_apple_store_after_seeing_my/) it's clear that there are some misconceptions about how they age. I mean, a 20% capacity loss doesn't seem so bad right? But, while 83% may still seem high to you, typically 70-80% of the original capacity is considered to be the end of life^[1](http://shop.tarjomeplus.com/Uploads/site-1/DownloadDoc/1061.pdf),[2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468617302979) (EOL) of a Li-ion battery. 

They function by shuttling lithium ions between graphite and another material. Over time these materials become stressed and damaged. During this, there are dozens of internal side reactions that occur which also damage and age the cell. The main causes of cell death are:

* Repeated cycling damages and cracks the graphite anode, lowering the amount of ions able to be intercalated into it
* Lithium metal plates on the anode and can pose thermal risk, also lowers total Li-ions available for cycling
* Passivation layers increase cell resistance past a practically useable point, and the cell cannot draw peak current

The last one, especially, is why sudden shutdowns at 50% occur. Batteries are dynamic chemical systems, and they can only perform at maximum for a limited number of cycles. To be clear, 80% of original capacity is NOT the reason for the end of life, but the indicator of these other processes. For iPhones at this point, they have chosen to throttle instead of allowing for sudden shutdowns. From a scientific perspective (and without dumping a ton of graphs and images on you) this is perfectly reasonable. 

I understand from a consumer perspective that you just want your things to work for as long as possible, and you don't want to know why they fail. Apple is good at hiding a lot of nitty gritty from us, but batteries are only as good as the chemistry inside them. There is no magic fix to increase cycle numbers or life, just research. Which is why scientists are so hard at work on developing new technologies. 

TL;DR:
Capacity loss is an indicator of other processes. 80% capacity is approximately the established end of life of a Li-ion battery. Performance is degraded, and unable to keep up with peak demand. Throttling as a reasonable trade-off at this point compared to sudden shutdowns. 

Edit: Just for clarification, I do agree that Apple hasn’t done their due diligence in communicating this decision with the end-user. Not everyone follows /r/Apple, or their press releases.",465,2022,2017-12-23,AAPL,0.1264471411705017,0.8536790609359741,0.01987384259700775

More Information : During 2 months I increase the game retention and trying differente version of the game. I deal with voodoo and transfer the game on the voodoo account. Few days after that, I realized that ketchapp post on facebook a video of a copycat, the video had 2.4 millions views and I can't do anything... 

Yuri Sanachev is the developer behind the copy.

I found that terrible that big company can copy idea without any consequences.

Apple's rule : 4.1 Copycats Come up with your own ideas. We know you have them, so make yours come to life.

In addition to risking an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App Store harder to navigate and just isn’t fair to your fellow developers.

My iPhone 5S and my new iPhone X had the same issue: If I wanted to just press play in my car controls or any other bluetooth device (or even Control Center) I had to go first to the Spotify app on my phone and then press play. It only worked without that if I was using the app a few minutes back. But after an hour, it's like the Play button ""rewired"" itself to Apple Music and because I didn't have any music there, it just didn't play anything.

apple,"According to the Wireless Power Consortium website, the iPhone X is not Qi Certified. Here are my thoughts on why that's interesting, and how it may affect users.","If you go through my post history you'll see I've tried to raise this a few times, usually getting 20 or so upvotes and a couple of comments from people along the lines of: 

*”Uh, Qi charging doesn’t work? The 7 chargers I bought off the Apple website for $79 each say otherwise!”*

*”Guess I should throw out my chargers then!”*

*”Apple probably didn't have it submitted for approval to maintain its secrecy before launch.”* 

*”I hope all those iPhone X users who've been charging on the Mophie and Belkin Qi pads are going to return all the energy that they illegitimately received.”* ^(seriously)

**I’m not saying Qi charging doesn’t work on the X**. I have one, it works, I love it. I just find it odd that it hasn’t passed certification, for the following reasons: 

* The 8 is certified. If neither were it’d be no big deal, it’d suggest Apple decided against certification and is happy with it’s own internal checks  - fine. But that’s not the case - the 8 and the X are different. The 8 being tested and passing suggests to me that the X would also be tested, has it failed? Why? 
* The 8 and the X were announced at the same time. 
* Apple points people to the WPC website to find safe chargers to use with it’s products yet some of their own products aren’t on there. They obviously think certification holds some value, why neglect it on the X?
* Qi Certification seems to offer some pretty legitimate device testing for strong magnetic fields. Non-certified devices reportedly have caused fires and skin burns. If the X has failed, is it a risk? On a less fear-mongering note, perhaps it isn’t a fire risk, but could it be damaging my battery? 
* The WPC website explicitly states “No match? Not licensed!” which to me suggests confidence in their turnaround times and that the X isn’t just in pre-approved limbo somewhere. 
* There may actually be a trademark license breach if Apple is using ‘Qi’ logos, etc. on the X without having passed certification.

apple,"As a current Android user, at least with Apple you CAN get an OEM battery replacement.","With all the hubbub about the iPhone battery situation, it got me thinking about the status of my batteries in my Google Pixel and my wife's Nexus 6P.  My Pixel battery seems to be lasting less and less over time and my wife's 6P really needs a new battery as the capacity is seriously reduced and shuts the phone down randomly.  Both are out of warranty.  Here's the thing: as far as I can tell, it's literally impossible to buy an actual first party OEM battery for either of these phones outside of a warranty replacement situation.  There is a 90+ page forum thread on xda developers forum with people trying to find OEM batteries for the Nexus 6p and it's literally impossible; people just go around in circles asking about arcane knowledge about which ebay vendor may or may not have a reasonably OK battery (ALL ebay batteries are listed as ""OEM"" but 0% of them actually are...).  As much as people may be pissed off at Apple for not telling people that they were throttling performance (understandably so), I have to say that as an Android user, the ability to pay Apple to replace the battery with an official OEM battery and do waterproof sealing is something I would LOVE to have in Android world.  I know there are plenty of 3rd party services to replace batteries in general, but none of them are first party and as far as I can tell none of them are guaranteed to use OEM batteries.

apple,"How to scam $200,000 per month and get 67,882 all 5 Star reviews on the app store","I often go researching apps on the app store to see what's trending, inspiration for app ideas, look at nice UI designs etc. 
This morning I came across this app which is currently ranked #26 in their category and had over 	67,882 all 5 star reviews. Yes, you read that right, all 5 star reviews despite only being available since September 15, 2017.

As soon as I read the name and rating, my bullshit meter went ding dong and I got extremely curious on how they have acheived such high ranking? Let's dig a bit.

----------------

The name is ""One Night Stand - Adult Hook up Tonight"" - if Ashley Maddison's ""Have an affair"" was too bold for you, this isn't that bad. Who doesn't want to have instant sex at a moment's notice with a complete stranger right? But any how, I digress. Let's move on to the app icon. Sure beauty is subjective but I would expect such a top rated dating app to have a bit better looking icon.

Let's look at the promotional text: ""Looking for someone who wanna find a dating with top hot singles and love adventures. Find the real dates online. Help you hook up with the one you interested in.""

I am an immigrant and English isn't my first language. But I am pretty sure there's a ton of grammatical errors in this. App claims ""real dates"". ROFL. ""Top hot singles"" &amp; ""love adventures"". LMFAO.

----------------

Let's read the description. I am going to trim this down a bit because I can only handle bullshit to a limit. 

*""If you are a good talker, maybe you can hookup with someone on a beautiful night. Drag your photos &amp; fill in your profile, with a click of mouse, you can check the one you like and chat with him/her directly. Start a chat freely since it’s your time to show and you may meet the one you like and hookup now.""*

**Click of a mouse eh. I didn't know Apple replaced the headphone jack with a fucking mouse.**

*""Get ready to a new dating with someone you like, enjoy chatting with him/her or dive into the world of passion and desire. All you need is our app One Night Stand. Search One Night Stand in iTunes now and be ready for a new life here. meet your fate one
Still shame to share your expression with others? Wanna make yourself more attractive? Eager to meet someone you like and wanna hookup with him/her directly. One Night Stand is your best choice. With all benefits above, you can enjoy more while you wanna hookup with someone.
Find the real one online, meet the one you like nearby &amp; One Night Stand will help you hook up with the one you interested in.
Now, download it, and then meet the one you love!""*

**MAN, I AM SOOOO GETTING LAID TONIGHTTTT!!! Just gotta buy this 1 Week at 19.99 USD in app purchase and I will make all kinds of ""love adventures"" with the ""top hot singles"". Or maybe I will go for the 3 months at 69.99 USD. 69 nomsayin ;)**

*""As our app enables the display of users' locations on a map, to help you find users nearby you, and before display your information, we would request for your permission, you have right to reject it and don’t use the feature, if you turn on the location sharing, then keep an eye on unfriendly person and fake information.""*

**I am no rocket scientist but I am sure this app is the definition of ""fake information"".**

----------------

Let's move on to the reviews. I don't like the iOS 11 app store review system, so I use Appannie to look at all the reviews.

The app has received a total of 68,066 reviews since inception. 
I sorted them to show ""5 star only"". I am a developer myself and my mind was absolutely blown with 	67,882 all 5 star reviews. Man, even Apollo for Reddit has only received a total of 3800 reviews with only 3100 5 star reviews. So this dating app must be exceptionally good. /s

Let's look at the name of the last few reviewers:
Maria84, 7Linda, 84Peter, Howard35, 61Nicola, Boyle33, Geoffrey93, Jones24, 66Celeste, Maggie42, Doyle19, 46Letitia,  18Michelle.

Anyone notice a pattern in these names? It's like someone left a phone directory inside a for loop.

No, I didn't make a typo pasting the same review twice. That's the same exact text, down to the typos reviewed by hundreds of different people within a few minutes. There's hundreds of reviews which start with the exact same first few lowercase characters, then a random word in upper case. There's another pattern of pasting some other popular app's name in the review - probably for ASO (App store optimization) purposes to get better ranking in the store. Some reviewers claim to get 9 month long relationships from a 3 month old **""one night stand""** app.

Now, sure, there are real reviews too which are all 1 star reviews warning everyone else about the scam but 3000 1 star real reviews easily get overpowered by 67000 5 star fake ones.

Let's look at the screenshots. App uses pictures of attractive women as you would expect from most dating apps. However let's dig a bit deeper. I downloaded the screenshots and did a reverse google search with them. These pictures are straight up stolen from someone's instagram profile and other chive articles with titles ""Sometimes you gotta let them breathe"" with pictures of women with big tits.

----------------

Next let's estimate the downloads and revenue for this app. For this, we go use SensorTower. For November, it estimates 70,000 downloads and $200,000 revenue. Now I know that sensor tower estimations aren't that accurate but for an app which is #26 in the store, I won't be surprised if this number were actually close enough. Considering this app has been available since September 15th and Christmas is when apps get the most revenue, I won't be surprised if they had scammed half a million by taking advantage of gullible people.

**EDIT:**

I downloaded the app to test it and no surprises, was bombarded with a ton of fake messages from obviously fake ""milfs"". But unfortunately, I couldn't read most of the messages as I couldn't afford to buy a $69 in app purchase. App was also filled with obvious typos, misspellings like ""Reciving info"" etc. Didn't bother wasting too much time on the app.

If anyone is interested, here are 2 copies of this app. I am not sure if they are different apps or the same because my browser shows them with the same icon but slightly different names. **Be careful if you download this, it will bombard you with popups asking you to subscribe to the in app purchase. Keep your finger OFF of the home button unless you want to accidentally buy the $69 IAP and hook up with some hot singles!**

~~I am also working on a way to download all reviews in bulk so I can recognize more similar patterns in the fake reviews.~~ **EDIT:** Check out a google docs data dump of all the reviews here:

Can we all please discuss how such scam gets around the app review team when us developers often have to go through such a strict app review on our legitimate apps? Can we also please discuss the completely broken rating system and how such app has been available on the store for over 3 months despite being reported countless times and despite getting thousands of fake 5 star reviews?

There were a few other posts couple months ago about apps claiming to be antivirus software but were just scam. This proves disparity in the app review system for legitimate apps vs such scam apps. 

**Proposed solutions:**

1.	Have some trigger which auto flags any app which is climbing up the rankings or getting too many reviews too fast and then have some human manually verify it?
2.	Flag reviews which have the same text.
3.	If an app has a subscription model OR very expensive pricing, pay extra attention while reviewing the app.
4.	Pay attention when reviewing apps and shit like “click of a mouse”, “Drag photos”, “Play store” should be easy to identify scams. When I submit my apps, they go through extreme scrutiny and often get rejected for silly stuff (example: Restore button not available for IAP - even though it actually is, App was rated 9+ and should be higher even though I rated the app 17+). So I wonder how these ones get through. 
5.	Why is reporting an app so hard on iOS? I can’t find a report button anywhere on the app page. Ended up using the support website to report it. 
6.     iOS 11 App store has no way to sort/filter reviews. So if you look at this app, it ONLY shows you the 5 star ratings ONLY. Completely hides the 1 star reviews which deceives the consumer. The app store should have a filter for sorting by time/rating, filtering by number of stars, should let you see other reviews from the same user etc.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wPKwLd8BIX3AFVFkSFQcPqqYMKBUd19StG_UT24s_tc/edit?usp=sharing

**EDIT:** Few people are asking me why I went through such extent to expose this? I did network security in school, so this is up my alley. Plus, I am a developer and make my living off of the app store, so this kind of stuff personally impacts me. Maybe I am jealous that a shady app is taking a spot in the top rankings which could be taken by real apps and also reducing the trust of regular people in the app store and making them skeptical about legitimate apps and in app purchases too. So when they would come across one of my legitimate apps with legitimate 5 star reviews, they would be skeptical. This stuff erodes the trust in a marketplace and should be exposed. Is it bad then that I am frustrated and outraged? You tell me.
