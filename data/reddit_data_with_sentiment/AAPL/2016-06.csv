apple,"My upcoming Reddit app Apollo needs some final beta testers. It has a beautiful iOS 9 design, awesome media viewer, push notifications, fast gestures, powerful comment and post composers, speedy navigation, and so so much more. Would love to have you! [Details inside]","Hey all,

A little over a year ago I [posted about a Reddit app I'm building called Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/), and it got an absolutely amazing response. I've been working on it tirelessly since then, and it's came a long way since that initial post.

It's coming down to the home stretch where I'm hoping to get in 2-3 more beta releases before I release it to the App Store. I'd really love to get some extra feedback from all of you before I release it, to hear what you think and catch any bugs that may be present.

**You can sign up here:** ~~http://goo.gl/forms/FSFsFRqS66bjIUgX2~~

***Sorry guys, that filled up a lot quicker than I thought it would. :/ The enthusiasm makes me really happy though, I'll work even harder to get it to the rest of you and the App Store really quickly! You can either subscribe to the subreddit, /r/apolloapp for updates, or sign up at [apolloapp.io](http://apolloapp.io) to be notified when it's released! Thank you so much again, can't wait to get it into all of your hands.***

A lot has happened in the last year, Alien Blue no longer being on the App Store being probably the biggest. I know a lot of people are migrating and looking for a new Reddit app to call home, and I'd really love for you to check out Apollo.

I'm a former Apple employee and long time Redditor and I've been working on Apollo for about two years now, being unhappy with the direction Alien Blue was going. I've built in a ton of features into Apollo since then, from a gorgeous media viewer, slick gestures and navigation, a full Markdown editor for comments and posts, Night Mode, 3D Touch, Touch ID unlock, Safari View Controller, and also includes some awesome features from Alien Blue, like swipe to collapse a comment and thumbnails for links in thread comments. More recently I've even built in almost-instant push notifications for Apollo users, so you can know within seconds if one of your comments or posts received a reply, even if the device is locked or Apollo is closed.

But most of all, I'm really happy that Apollo adheres to iOS' design guidelines really closely. I want it to feel immediately familiar and right at home on your iPhone (and iPad in the future).

### Here's an album showing some of the features: http://imgur.com/a/oASdM

There's about 500 spots available, and I'll be adding users on Monday alongside a new beta release. There's still a significant amount of bug-squashing I need to do before it gets to the App Store, but it's more or less feature-complete at this point and your help in finding the bugs will be an instrumental help in creating an amazingly smooth and stable experience for everyone when it comes to the App Store soon. :)

Feel free to ask me any questions!

They needed the computer (no box), Student ID, Real ID, and receipt. Just wanting to let you guys know if you have recently bought a Macbook and want to pick up free beats. 

The beats are pretty. I know its super cool to hate beats (and apple) but they sound really good when wired and while wireless they're decent.

apple,My first swift iOS app: Binged. Let's you track shows and view episodes and casts.,"Hi Apple :D.

I just released my first pure Swift iOS app called **Binged**.

link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/binged/id1120570590?ls=1&amp;mt=8


It allows you to track TV shows, view episode summaries, view similar shows, casts and bios.

&amp;nbsp;

This is my first ever iOS app, first time working on Xcode and Swift. I have Java &amp; Web experience, no Obj-C background either.
 
I started around 4 months ago from scratch, reading blogs, watching videos, Youtube, StackOverFlow, Lynda.com. I still have a lot to learn. Working on this app was probably the most fun I've had in programming for quite awhile. Lots of learning, lots of re-writes, and some more learning. I had to get familiar with Swift syntax, CocoaTouch, pulling my hair out with auto-layouts and constraints and then StackViews. I probably re-did each view at least a dozen times. Worked with CoreData for local saves and then CloudKit for syncing and changes. For this first project, I wanted to stay with mostly Apples Swift frameworks, so the only 3rd party APIs I used were SwiftyJSON and AlamoFire.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

apple,Battery life difference between rMB 2016 M5 and M7?,"Hey guys

So like many others I was waiting for the new rMBPs on June 13th. But not only are they now rumored to be released in late 2016 by several ITKs, a guy I know who works in an Apple store told me, that they expect them around October. 

The thing is, I can't wait that long. And since (at least for the next 1-2 years) I would be fine with a little less power than what I expected from a new MBP, I think I will pull the trigger on a rMB 2016.

Now I will definitely chose the 512GB model as I really need the space. But I am not sure yet about the processor.

Usually I buy the maxed out version since I want the most power available. But the difference between M5 and M7 seems marginal.

However, I am wondering now if there is also a significant difference in battery life between the two? Will the M7 use noticeably more power?

Which processor would you guys recommend to me? I will use it for office work, photo editing of large photo collections, photo shop/pixelmator, occasianlly other CC Apps, Parallels with Windows 10, and then the usual private use of an internet machine.

I lost my credit card and called to report a lost card and get a new one. It was an automated process, and I didn't talk to a person.

iphone,Verizon rep sold me 'new' phone that actually had been serviced by Apple over a year ago inherently making it an out of warranty phone. What are my options?,"I'll keep this short. So basically last summer, I went to an 'authorized' Verizon retailer located at 102 Fulton Street in NY.

The rep tells me that that I have an upgrade and that iPhone 5S's are on sale (probably due to the 6 coming out soon).

So I bite, get a 64GB model, see him do some weird diagnostic stuff while I was choosing a case. He managed to keep my line with the unlimited plan.

When I got home, I noticed the receipt, but no box. First mistake.

Then the phone started having battery issues (draining quickly, charging port kept becoming increasingly selective on chargers, even ones that used to work with it before.)

Fast forward to last week (I was on a Nexus 6P from the fall to the winter until I was mugged and had my phone stolen by two guys back in March.)

So, reluctantly I switch back to my iPhone 5S 64GB model. Updated to newest OS, everything good so far except the battery.

Literally, 8 hours it would be dead. Then it became picky with chargers to a point where it just stopped accepting all except one crummy, but real one.

So a couple weeks ago, I plug the phone in, and the screen starts getting like its getting an internal zombie virus, and then the screen craps out. Ok, no phone again.

So I take the phone to the Apple Store yesterday and they tell me that the phone had been originally purchased on 28-Nov-13! And since then had been serviced and therefore out of warranty.

I bought the phone 6/6/15. So I tried to go to the retailer but of course they closed early and so their 'system' is offline.

What should I do? I don't particularly want to go back there because its not easy to get to, and aside from reporting them to Verizon, FTC, BBB.

What are my options with them when I all them later?

**TL;DR Verizon rep sold me 'new' phone that actually had been serviced by Apple inherently making it an out of warranty phone.**

**UPDATE**: So I called the manager at the store and told him that some guy named Greg bought the phone and Apple proved it to me that it was purchased 11/28/13, and sold to me 'new' on 6/6/15. 

**THIS IS THE BEST PART**

HE SAYS TO BRING THE PHONE, THAT APPLE CANNOT TURN ON TO RUN A DIAGNOSTIC, AND SAID  WITH FULL CONFIDENCE. HIS WARRANTY WOULD BE BETTER BECAUSE APPARENTLY APPLE CANT FIX IPHONES WITH NOT STOLEN PARTS.

This audacity makes me want to shut his whole shady business down because they've gotten many bad Yelp reviews, and shadily don't advertise their physical location as being in 102 Fulton, but rather in Tribeca.

Thoughts?

apple,Apple should fix the Clipboard on iOS to make accessing it require Permission. This is a massive opening for malicious apps.,"Recently I noticed that apps like Facebook and others have been [showing text from my iOS clipboard](http://i.imgur.com/qVxDOQo.jpg) without me having pasted it. This contained a private link at the time, and it was definitely something I never intended for Facebook to have due to its sensitive nature. 

This is a massive privacy risk, as it means that Apps can access what could potentially be sensitive information in your clipboard without your authorisation, after which the App can then transmit this data back to their servers. **This whole process is silent** and the user would not know.

This means that if you use 1Password for example to copy a password and then go into a malicious app, your clipboard could be scraped and the password transmitted back to their servers without you even noticing. So ironically, using 1Password to generate strong passwords could be less secure with this loophole. 

I think this is terrible when users may routinely out of ignorance copy and paste passwords, emails and sensitive information to their clipboard, and never realise that apps are accessing this information, and this is especially so with complicated passwords and apps like 1Password which rely on copying passwords out of the App.

**There needs to be another seperate permission for the Clipboard to be accessed per app, or for this clipboard hook to be closed.**

apple,What's the best CarPlay head unit these days?,"Hi All,

I bought a new (used) car yesterday. Good news: the head unit already has CarPlay! Of course now that I have a unit with CarPlay, I'm analyzing everything, and I think I would like to swap it out. It's the Pioneer AVIC-7000NEX. It's not bad. Actually, let me rephrase that. Coming from a traditional stereo, this 7"" touch screen with Apple UI is amazing!

That being said, the screen is resistive, not capacitive, which I find annoying. Also, it doesn't look like it supports Android Auto, which I ""need"" for my work phone.

I spent some time on the Pioneer website. They have so many models now. It looks like only the highest end has a capacitive touchscreen.

What's the best right now?

Edit: and oh... one thing I noticed... the Pioneer I have has 4x50W for speaker output. According to the JBL specs, it only has 4x20W. Is that going to be an issue? I'm not a car audio guy. No idea what kind of speakers are in my car, etc.",74,229,2016-06-12,AAPL,0.023572158068418503,0.9381218552589417,0.03830597549676895

apple,You can now get cash at Bank of America ATMs with Apple Pay,"Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay can be used to make withdrawals and transfers at Bank of America ATMs without the need for a physical card. This only works at some Bank of America ATMs, but it's scheduled to roll out to all Bank of America ATMs this year. This does not work for deposits, which is weird since you would think withdrawals pose a greater risk for the bank than deposits. It could be due to how the deposit system is set up at Bank of America.

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/5NR12)

I also tested withdrawals at this ATM with my Chase Visa, Citibank MasterCard, Charles Schwab Visa, and UNFCU Visa debit cards in Apple Pay. All of them made it past the PIN entry and amount selection screens, but got stuck when the ATM was about to spit out the cash. The ATM gave an error that the transaction was not supported and that the card should be inserted in the card slot to continue with the transaction, so third party cards seem to not work at this point. Finally, I wanted to make sure that normal withdrawals were working, so I did a test withdrawal at this ATM with my physical Charles Schwab debit card and the withdrawal processed just fine.

Edit: If you go looking for Apple Pay capable ATMs, keep in mind that they don't all look like the one in my pictures. /u/tmiw posted a [picture](http://imgur.com/LEDP5A7) of what the NFC reader might look like on other Bank of America ATMs, though the reader wasn't enabled for /u/tmiw to try it.

apple,watchOS 3 should have a 2-panel Control Center like iOS 10. That would be perfect for audio controls.,"I just submitted this feedback to Apple:

One of the most important functions of the Apple Watch is audio controls. Your wrist is the perfect place to control music and podcasts, as it's simpler than having to reach into your pocket for your iPhone.

In watchOS 1 and 2, this was accomplished via Glances. It was helpful, but the problem was that once you hit 5+ Glances, it became too confusing to find the audio control Glance each time.

watchOS 3 does away with Glances in favour of the Dock. This is a big improvement for jumping to apps, but it's problematic in terms of quickly accessing audio controls. The question is, how do you retain the Dock and Control Center, while simultaneously allowing for easy-access audio controls?

It turns out that the iOS 10 designers solved this! The Control Center is perfect. Add in a second panel dedicated to audio controls, and the problem is solved. It's only two panels, so it doesn't have the confusion of 5+ Glances, and it's simple to access - especially if you allow watchOS to remember which of the two panels you were last on, just as iOS 10 does. That way, when you swipe up, you're either on the Control Center or the audio controls each time, depending on where you were last time.",67,251,2016-06-21,AAPL,0.076533742249012,0.8931652307510376,0.030300971120595932

However, they noticed the coating on my screen was rubbing off which they noted was a common problem for this model. They sent it off to replace the screen for free under warranty. Yesterday, I went to pick it up and saw the beautiful new screen.

apple,Is it worth being locked into the Apple ecosystem?,"I'm at a bit of a crossroads right now when it comes to tech. I've used Microsoft hardware and services in the past, Google's more recently, and just bought a Chromebook (that won't really be ideal for Android apps since it's not a touchscreen). Lately I've been thinking hard about a mixed ecosystem using my iMac as a daily driver, selling the Chromebook to buy an iPad as my companion/travel device, and an Android phone (Moto G 3rd Gen to be precise). I'd be using primarily Microsoft services with the exception of Kobo for eBooks, Google Play Music because I like the included YouTube Red subscription, and Vudu/Ultraviolet for my admittedly small movie collection.

Then I started considering: Why not just go all in with Apple? Truth be told, I hate the idea of being locked to any one ecosystem (that's why I stopped using Amazon's services), but my wife already has an iPad and will soon be picking up an iPhone SE, and if there are significant advantages to doing so then I could see us becoming an ""Apple family,"" so to speak.

When you get to the app, they are clearly claiming that this is a mod for Minecraft: PE. See: imgur.com/BGuNQQE


Oh, but hang on! This app is advertised as something for Minecraft PE and says it's a mod for the app, but you didn't read all of the details! It's really a guide for installing a mod for the Minecraft *desktop* version. And this entire app said its for the Pocket Edition version! See: imgur.com/OWAW9JK


If some people don't read the entire description, since that slither of info is at the very bottom, they'll easily get ripped off. The developer even purchased fake reviews to get this app up the charts. Regular consumers warning people about the app HAVE to give it a 5 star rating for their review to appear at the top.

Six years ago, we launched [Homescreen.me](http://homescreen.me) â€” a simple site where you could upload your iPhone or iPad homescreens and share it with your friends and followers on Facebook and Twitter. It was a beloved side-project of mine based off a simple idea â€” I saw many users sharing their homescreens on Twitter and instead of uploading them on random image uploading websites, Homescreen.me was designed to be a dedicated way to do that. We got some great feedback and most of our users loved the site. 

I always wanted to do more about it and in early 2015, we started with a complete revamp and building a native iOS app for it. After months of hard work, Apple rejected it for a [really absurd reason](https://blog.homescreen.me/build-get-rejected-by-apple-ship-anyway-4fe5b1b8eb4).

Not wanting to be let down, we built most of the features from the app into the website and re-launched it yesterday. With the new site, you can:

* Upload and share your iPhone homescreen (iPad coming soon)
* Upload and share your Apple Watch screenshot (Watch face or icon hive)
* Discover new app and wallpapers
* 'Heart' the homescreens that you really like
* Easily share on Facebook and Twitter

Some of the features that we're working on:

* Ability to embed on your own site or blog
* Ability to follow other users and get notified when they upload a new screen
* Ability to view all your past uploads and see how your homescreen has evolved over time.

We got some great feedback last time and this time too, we're open to any kind of feedback you have. Love it/Hate it? Have suggestions? Found a bug? Let us know, we're all ears.

iphone,Apple store recommends that I don't restore my replacement phone and just start as new ...,"Hi guys,

I went to an Apple Store with an Iphone 5 that had battery issues, and paid $80 to get a new placement phone.

However, within a week the new phone started showing the same symptoms (screen unresponsive, turning on and off on its own etc) so I took it back, and they recommended that I reset the whole phone and don't restore my phone data from itunes but start it fresh.

I'm here to ask if anyone heard of that fixing the issue. I'm not doubting their advice, but the symptoms only appear once in awhile, so if I follow their advice I'd have to program all my numbers, etc manually, without even knowing if it'll fix the 
problem at all.

If that's the only way to get my phone working, does anybody know if there's an alternative to 1) restoring my phone data via itunes or 2) doing it manually?

apple,Thinking about switching from PC to Apple....,"Long story short, PC innovation sucks (I recently bought an 2014 XPS and it isn't compatible at all with Windows 10, which makes the laptop almost entirely useless without a lot of inconveniences) and I'm considering switching to Apple. 

Please be honest and tell me if I'm making the right decision, based on my usage- because I don't want to spend an upward of 1k if it's not going to be useful for me. I work in IT, but I've only ever used PCs. 

I am a research student, so I use my laptop for both research, research apps, and internet surfing. I want it to be fast and easy to handle, and I think I'd be best suited with a 13 inch... However, I've never used an 11 inch, so if anyone has and has some insight on it, I'd love to hear!

Secondly, which laptop would even be suited for me? I know I don't need higher than an i5 and I don't need much storage and RAM, but I have no idea if a MacBook, an Air, or a Pro would be best. Everytime I talk to CS they seem to point me in the most expensive direction (and I've done a few experiments asking for advice for various reasons just to see what they'd say). Windows does this too, so I'm not too surprised. I figured I'd come ask the users, because you guys would know much better than me.

Finally, what is the best discount I could get/ where is the best place to buy a Mac for the best price?

Thank you so much, sincerely appreciate it!",211,72,2016-06-27,AAPL,0.021933358162641525,0.9179725050926208,0.06009414792060852

apple,How to use your Apple Watch as a sleep tracker.,"This is the best method I've found for using the Apple Watch as a sleep tracker. Also, I don't work for Sleep++ (the app used) but it's just the one I've found works the best.

1. Download and configure the Sleep++ app to your liking on your phone / sync it with the Apple Watch and allow Sleep++ to be used as a complication if you want (I think this is on by default).

2. When you're ready to go to sleep, put your watch into airplane mode (swipe up and then left a few times to get to the control panel) to save your battery during the night while Sleep++ is running.

3. Open Sleep++ on your watch and click ""start."" When you wake up, click ""stop."" Sleep++ will analyze your sleeping habits over time and make graphs for you that you can also have synced automatically over to HealthKit. It's a pretty neat process.



The watch actually does a remarkable job, just as good as a Fitbit I've found (if not better), of analyzing periods of sleep and wakefulness during the night. If your watch is in Airplane mode, Sleep++ only drains about 20-25% of the battery, which isn't bad for being used all night.

When you wake up the next day, if you keep the watch in airplane mode, you only need to charge it for about a half hour to get it to 80%, even if it's pretty low. It gets full in under an hour. You might also be able to use an iPad charger to charge it even faster (but your millage may vary and it might be too powerful, I'm not sure).",88,84,2016-06-28,AAPL,0.021120687946677208,0.9203099012374878,0.058569472283124924

iphone,"finally no case, my iPhone is beautiful to me again","For years since my first iPhone that I bought 7 years ago  (iPhone 3GS), I have been using cases to protect the phone. And for that same amount of time I have been hating the idea of hiding the gorgeousness of my beautiful phone while at the same time wondering what would I do if something bad would happen to my precious iPhone. What if the screen scratched? what if I dropped it? What if I hit the phone against a sharp object? what if , what if , what if. ........

A few days ago, after discussing my iPhone fears with  a few friends, I finally said enough is enough. I'm done with cases. These iPhones are too beautiful to hide!  Also I'm thinking, with the amount of money I spent on protective cases over the years, I could probably buy multiple phones, or at least it would pay for replacing the screen a few times over.

....so now, I am ""living on the edge"" as they say. Using my silver iPhone SE without a case,  and loving it's beauty, it's colors, it's shinyness, etc.

Can anybody else relate to what I am writing? Would love to hear other people's experience.",118,80,2016-06-28,AAPL,0.03314065933227539,0.9245592951774597,0.0423000194132328
