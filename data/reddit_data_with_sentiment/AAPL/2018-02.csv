apple,"iPhone X Uses Pulse Width Modulation, Which Is a Serious Issue for a Sensitive Few","Since purchasing iPhone X I’ve suffered from eye strain, headaches, and throbbing pain behind my eyes. It’s disappointing that I can’t use my new iPhone without some degree of pain, but what’s most concerning is that these symptoms persist for hours after usage.

This is most likely due to Apple’s utilization of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which flickers the display at varying frequencies depending on the brightness level. Apple has avoided using this technology on previous iPhones, but evidently had to incorporate it to utilize Samsung’s OLED panel. This represents a major compromise for the sensitive few. 

While many do not experience issues from it, users may be sensitive to PWM without even realizing it’s present. It’s the minority of users, but it’s a significant minority especially considering that this can extend into being a medical issue. 

Basically, the iPhone X flickers *a lot* in a manner that’s supposed to be indiscernible to the human eye but for some users this aggressive, varying flicker can cause a whole host of health issues. Noticeable or not, this is not ideal for the eyes especially with hours of daily usage. 

To demonstrate what this means in practice, I’ve filmed two quick videos using the iPhone’s slo-mo camera mode. One demonstrating the flicker on iPhone X at varying brightness levels, the other the iPhone 8 Plus which doesn’t utilize PWM. 

iPhone X PWM flicker demonstration:

https://youtu.be/Oo3eoRbojPY

iPhone 8 Plus with *no* flicker:

https://youtu.be/v9V8gWddV4U

I love my iPhone X otherwise, and just want to be able to use it without pain. I propose to Apple to add an option in Accessibility that modifies or totally disables PWM, if possible. Even if it doesn’t affect *you* personally, this is a real issue for many users and I’m desperately trying to make Apple aware of the severity for those sensitive to the PWM they’ve implemented.


**As an avid iPhone fan who’s been suffering from the PWM for months, I’m desperate for Apple to release a real resolution. At the least, I hope getting my voice out there on this issue makes Apple reconsider incorporating PWM again in next-generation iPhones.**

*If you’re experiencing eye strain, please contact Apple via the feedback link below and make them aware that it’s an issue for more than just a few users.*

apple,"Dear /r/Apple's AutoModerator: no one uses /r/AppleWhatShouldIBuy or /r/AppleHelp. Those subreddits are dead, and posts there often go days without replies. You need another solution instead of just removing posts in /r/Apple.","I am getting annoyed seeing AutoModerator remove posts in /r/Apple all because the mods want to decrease the number of questions in this subreddit.

It's my opinion that people asking questions are part of what make this subreddit thrive. I have answered many questions, small and large, and people have done the same for me. Helping people is part of what makes the Apple community such a great place to be a part of, and we shouldnt be shutting questions down only to suggest they instead go someplace else where no one will help them.

If if users on this subreddit really don't like helping others, then /r/Apple needs to get on board with the Reddit redesign, [which is going to use flair like ""tags"" that can easily be enabled/disabled to see posts that match that content](https://redditblog.com/2017/11/08/an-update-on-reddits-redesign/).

No one uses /r/AppleWhatShouldIBuy or /r/AppleHelp and other subs that this AutoModerator recommends, so change the criteria. Because all i'm going to do otherwise is re-word the question to get around AutoModerator's aggressive behavior. And I recommend others do the same.

apple,I downgraded from a 2017 MacBook Pro to a 2015 MacBook Pro and my productivity soared.,"A bit of backstory:

For the longest time, I used my old 2012 MacBook Pro, even though the battery died very quickly, it was bulky compared to the newer MacBooks, and had started to slow down quite significantly.

Even so, I was able to be really productive using it, specifically when it came to writing... I could type for hours on my old 2012 MacBook Pro and not get tired. I loved using it, loved typing on it, loved working on it, would bring it with me everywhere. 

Finally, I decided to upgrade and switched to a top-of-the-line 2017 MacBook Pro 13"" with TouchBar. It was sexy, it was thin, the keyboard wasn't as comfortable to type on, but hey, it made a nice 'clack' sound when you pressed the keys.

Over the next few months, though, I realized my productivity had been significantly falling. I had stopped writing for pleasure, and would only type when I absolutely had to. I used my MacBook more like an iPad — browsing, clicking, scrolling. I 'liked' my new MacBook, but I didn't love it like my old 2012 MacBook.

I suspected the keyboard was holding me back, but I didn't realize how bad it really was. After all, I was using the second-generation butterfly keyboard. Wasn't it supposed to be better than the first one?

Then I read a post by [/u/7506blasting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7fke97/why_apple_wont_do_what_marco_wants_to_fix_the/dqcuaxy/):

&gt; The [butterfly] keyboard is objectively bad. We've had decades of research into ergonomics, we know what works. The mac pro keyboard puts all the shock of a key impact, and more strain on your fingers than any other keyboard I've used. It's only marginally better than typing on a tablet. No travel means no cushioning. It's like punching a wall instead of a bag.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course we get used to it (we can get used to anything, even typing on phones - doesn't mean it isn't hugely inferior) but all the strain is now on your finger. You have to press lightly - but try doing that when you're in the flow, tired at the end of the day, when you've already put out thousands of words and just want to be done. I'm genuinely concerned a year or two of using this keyboard would bring me very close to RSI, arthritis, or any other joint issues in my hands. 

And that was it. I finally saw how bad the keyboard was (for me).

I couldn't go back to my 2012 MacBook Pro (it really was slow at this point), so I went on eBay and found a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro 2015... the last MacBook with a comfortable, usable, meant-for-writing keyboard.

Holy shit.

The difference stunned me. The 'old' keyboard was so much better than the 'butterfly keyboard' that I had to put up with for months. I didn't have to hammer away at the keys. My fingers danced across the keyboard and the familiar 'mushy' keys responded quickly and easily. It was an absolute joy.

All the love I felt for the Mac came back. This was a real laptop. This was a real machine that I could use for work, that was designed to be typed on.

And on top of that, the little things. Having dedicated volume buttons on the top row. Dedicated pause/play button. And USB-A ports. Wow. Being able to use *any* old cable or external drive, without thinking of finding an adapter? It was pure luxury.

I am never giving up this laptop. I'm even thinking of buying another one and just keeping it in my closet for the eventual day that this one might die.

I don't see Apple going back to the old, comfortable, fantastic keyboards, like the one on the 2015 model. They're too obsessed with thinness and too proud to reverse a decision like that. (And some people do seem to like the butterfly keyboard, which makes the whole situation even more muddled).

Which basically means that... the 2015 MacBook Pro is the last MacBook I'll ever truly love. If we're gonna keep using the butterfly keyboard in the 2018, 2019, 2020 MacBooks, there's no way that I can go back to that hell. (And it is hell, for me, when your work depends on you typing and you're given a sub-par keyboard.)

I don't know at what point Apple shifted from aesthetics/usability balance to just the aesthetics, but I find it extremely sad. I love the Mac, I love macOS, I want to keep using the platform. For now, I still can. But I don't know what I'm gonna do five or ten years from now.

If you're using one of the 2016 or 2017 MacBooks and you find your productivity falling or you're not writing as much as you used to, I urge you to look into switching back to an older Mac or at least a different external keyboard. The difference for me was night and day.",1229,5618,2018-02-08,AAPL,0.09851980954408646,0.8690636456012726,0.03241652436554432

apple,"As a long-time Apple fanboy, even I have to finally admit MacBooks are overpriced","When I bought my MacBook Air in mid 2012, I truly believed I was getting an amazing value. Amazing industrial design, the likes of which very few (if any) PC laptop manufactures were putting out. In fact many of the ultra-books we see today take after the MacBook Air. Top notch specs, such as SATA III, USB 3.0, an SSD hard drive, etc... So light, razor thin, amazing battery life. I am still using it today and the only thing I've done to it is switch out the battery. It still works amazing and is still fast.

Sure, it was a little more expensive than other laptops with similar specs, but it was truly amazing and I knew it would have great resale value and amazing customer/physical brick and mortar store support.

Fast forward to today, and my mom just bought a Lenovo Yoga 720 13"" with the following specs for $1099:

* 8th Generation Intel Core™ i7-8550U Processor (1.80GHz 8MB)
* 13.3"" FHD IPS AntiGlare Multitouch (1920x1080) with integrated camera
* 16.0GB DDR4 2133 MHz (Onboard)
* 512GB PCIe SSD
* Intel UHD Graphics 620

Now compare that to the latest 13"" MacBook Pro with the following similar specs that comes out to a whopping $1899:

* 2.3GHz dual-core 7th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz
* 13.3"" LED-backlit IPS display; 2560-by-1600 native resolution
* 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory
* 512GB SSD storage
* Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640

The MacBook processor is 1 generation behind and less powerful, and the RAM is LPDDR3 vs the DDR4 ram on the Lenovo. Granted, the screen has a higher resolution and most probably looks nicer, but I would say 1080p is still pretty nice on a 13"" screen.

The MacBook also only has 2 Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.0 Type C ports while the Lenovo has those AND another regular (Type A) USB 3.0 port.

I could understand/justify in my mind if the MacBook was maybe $200 or even $300 more expensive, citing maybe better build quality and better customer support, but long gone are the days where the MacBook design blows anything else out of the water. The Lenovo in my example is also very well designed and light (much like the MacBook Air). There is no reasonable justification in my mind for the $800 price difference.

I used to recommend MacBooks to my friends who came to me looking for recommendations, but I can no longer in good faith go tell them to spend close to $2000 on a laptop they could get the equivalent or better of for less than almost half the cost.

Thoughts?

Edit:

Wow this post kind of blew up, thanks to everyone's civil responses, and for everyone else with their childish comments, well, you probably actually are a child so that's okay too.

I did some more research on LPDDR3 vs DDR4 and it seems that their ACTIVE power usage is similar, meaning battery life wont be affected much differently between the two while using the machine. However, LPDDR3 has much better STANDBY power usage, meaning a it will considerably help when a laptop is on standby mode in terms of retaining battery life.

Also, many people are saying that the MBP CPU is just as powerful...here are some benchmarks:

https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?id=3036
https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?id=3064

I'd love to reply to everyone individually, and maybe I will to some, but there are a lot more comments than I expected. 

So in summary, I'll say that I definitely understand that MacBook Pros and Apple products in general are built well. I should know, I have many of them. But what I am ALSO saying, is that PC laptops have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY better in build quality as well, case in point the Lenovo Yoga, yet the price difference between these devices has increased significantly.

I did not want to bring in the MacOS vs Windows debate into this as I was only looking at hardware/design/quality, but yes I agree, MacOS is better. I also use Windows 10 however, and I wouldn't say it's terrible.

Also, looked at some comparisons of the graphics between the two. It's safe to say that while the MBP card is better, no one that is going to NEED a graphics card for graphics intensive activities (such as gaming or rendering) is going to get either machine.

The MBP has an amazing trackpad, 100% true.

So yes, the MBP has a better trackpad, a better screen, and has slightly better build quality. But at the same time, the Lenovo has a better CPU, more ports (a lot of people still really want at least one USB Type A port), a touch screen, is a 2 in 1 (can be used as a tablet), and very good build quality from what I can tell.

Bottom line, would I PERSONALLY still buy a MacBook? Probably, and yes it would be better to compare once the MBP update comes in. But for the average consumer, I can no longer easily recommend getting a MacBook. The price difference has gotten too high and yet the quality difference has gotten smaller.",351,378,2018-02-08,AAPL,0.021681695245206356,0.6680451929569244,0.31027311459183693

apple,Got my HomePod this morning! Brief first impressions,"https://imgur.com/YN0Th4e

* I was prepared for it to be physically larger than I thought it was, based on the reviews, but even still it surprised me with its size and heft 

* The outer fabric is soft, but firm. I am worried my cats may use it as a scratching post

* The touch control area at the top is glossy and smooth, like the surface of the Apple TV 4th Gen remote (the non-touch area)

* Setup is entirely seamless, just like pairing AirPods, with a few more steps. It makes a few chimes along the way, and Siri talks you through some basic functionality. The audio quality present in the chimes and in Siri's voice is notably clear and crisp

* Siri finishes setup by asking you to tell it to play some music, creating a Radio-style playlist, that chose a song I liked a lot

* Audio is very good, with impressive clarity and loudness. I'm no audiophile, but I do enjoy music a great deal, and the quality of HomePod is immediately evident from the moment you start using it. 

* Setup grabs Apple Music AppleID details, etc from the phone, so no time was spent entering those in

* Hey Siri activates extremely well, at normal speaking volume, and I have been able to get it to play stuff on Apple Music and Podcasts very easily

* The touch controls on the top work exactly as you would imagine they would

* On the phone, HomePod's media and volume controls can be accessed easily in Control Center in the Media Playback area

* Tried Overcast via AirPlay, and found it was dropping audio every few seconds, making it unusable. Was able to AirPlay from the Music app without issue, so I imagine Overcast may need an update (plus I am running iOS 11.3 beta, so it could also be entirely because of that)

All in all, I'm fairly happy with it. It is replacing an old AirPlay speaker (connected via AirPort Express) that I use every day, so from an audio perspective alone it is a vast improvement. A bit disappointed that I'm having issues with Overcast, but at least I can still ask the HomePod to play podcasts via Apple Podcasts for now. I've been impressed with how Siri understands my requests for podcasts when I do ask her, but I'm looking forward to when the bugs with Overcast/AirPlay are sorted out and I can continue to use Overcast. 

The smart features are certainly not anything to write home about overall, but for now I am content, because it is clear the hardware is very good. It'll be disappointing if in a year's time we haven't seen significant additions to Siri's functionality, but we'll see what happens. I am very happy with it as a speaker, which is really what I wanted it for.",238,509,2018-02-09,AAPL,0.035487789660692215,0.9305022358894348,0.03401002287864685

apple,Apple is hiding technology so you can enjoy your music,"I've bought many expensive speakers and headphones over time but Apple is changing how I enjoy my music. AirPods and HomePod are easily my favorite purchases, they always put a smile on my face when I'm using them. Apple is approaching audio in a way that allows you to enjoy your audio without it demanding anything of you (barring the lock-in to the Apple ecosystem).

With AirPods, they removed the cord effectively while still allowing you to switch devices easily. They sound good enough for how small they are and I've never had to worry about battery life with them. AirPods allow me to go about my life and forget they are even there.

The HomePod is doing the same for me but in my home. I have the Sonos Play:5 and I love that thing but it only sounds great if you're sitting in the sweet spot or have the volume at optimal levels. I have to adjust myself to fully enjoy the Play:5 and you have to use their god awful player. Not so with the HomePod, it works for me just like the AirPods. I can move around my kitchen and living room and get that room filling sound, I don't even need line of sight to it.

In my opinion the HomePod's technical achievement is the Auto EQ and it's ability to sound good at ANY volume level. Being able to listen to music at 10/20% is nothing short of amazing. I'm able to wake up with my morning coffee and play some tunes without blasting it. Maybe you're in an apartment and you don't want to wake the neighbors at midnight, don't worry about it with the HomePod, you'll get all that juicy sound at 10% volume. I can also listen to music longer with less fatigue and I rarely feel the need to kick the volume up at certain parts of the song. You also don't need to rearrange your house or think about where to best place it. The best spot for your HomePod is where it looks great in your house.

Apple is hiding the technology so you can enjoy your music without it getting in the way.

iphone,iPhone Water Resistance (story),"Hi All,

Just thought I would share a story that occurred yesterday. My wife and I were walking next to a lake and due to an unfortunate event her iPhone 7 fell into the lake. This is Canada in February and it was above zero but still pretty cold. We tried to get it initially but couldn’t get deep enough because the phone was about 5 feet underwater and I wasn’t willing to track back to our car in completely soaked clothing at 0° temperatures. 

We abandoned it to try to find a way to retrieve it and purchased one of those clamp gripper pickup things from the store. I switched into shorts and went back to the spot where we dropped it. I waded into the lake and was able to retrieve the phone but was dubious about whether or not it would still work after nearly 3 hours underwater at a depth of 5 feet. Apples official line is that it water resistance is good to 30 minutes at 3 feet depth. 

Surprisingly, I pulled the phone out and it was still working! All the functions are working the speaker seems fine, it charges properly and the screen is great. The phone is in perfect condition after spending three hours at the bottom of a nearly freezing Canadian lake.

Kudos to Apple on making an amazing device!",76,476,2018-02-11,AAPL,0.02366943471133709,0.9203716516494751,0.05595890432596207

I have a small home but I’d say I can get 20-25 feet away, with walls half blocking my line of sight with the HomePod, and it can still take my requests with high volume music playing. It’s utterly amazing because Hey Siri not working while my iPhone plays music was the biggest sore point for myself. 

However, it makes watching any videos or podcasts that say Hey Siri unbearable. I tried to record a Snapchat of a request. I played it back on my iPhone 5 feet away at the lowest possible volume, and it kept looping the same answer back at me. 

I also watched some reviews, listened to some podcasts, and watched the Apple made tutorial videos on my desktop (where my HomePod also sits). Nope. Learned quickly I’ll either need to avoid these things completely or turn off hey Siri which basically turns HomePod into a dumb speaker.

This seemingly small feature is so helpful.

I’m hoping that Apple’s next step is to clean up artist pages (better album organization plus consolidation of the Apple Music artist page with your library page for that artist). That plus this iOS 11.3 change will make the general flow and usability of the Music app so much better.

Other multi device Qi chargers require you to place the devices on a specific space because  every device needs to be aligned to its own charging coil 
but Apple seems to have invented a technology that allows any of three devices to be place however the user wants to place them.

That opens the door to a counter top which is Qi enabled on its entire surface so people can put their devices on it without having to worry that they haven't aligned them properly.

apple,"I think Apple Music (and Spotify) really need to separate Studio Albums from Singles, EPs, Lives &amp; other albums on artists' pages","Hello! As a subscriber of both Apple Music and Spotify I think the two services are very similar on their features AND their problems. My main gripe with both is the management of Artists' discography on their pages.

When I go into an artists page, specially when discovering new ones, I really want to see all of their Studio Albums, chronologically ordered in one tab. That way I can properly get to know their work and feel/hear the evolution and changes from their sound through the years, as their career goes by.

For me, it doesn't make sense to have the actual albums mixed with Singles, older EPs (from when they were starting as band/group/career), Live versions, Collabs, Acoustic versions etc. That way end up seeing multiple versions of the same song, and if you never listened to it, you might take ages to find out which is the original one.

Is it too much to ask for a more organised approach for artists pages, like one ""Studio Discography"" tab and one ""Other Versions/Songs"" tab for those services?

apple,"In June of 2016, I began a weight-loss journey through the use of my Apple Watch. By February 2017, I'd lost 100 pounds. A year later, I'm still healthy thanks to my Apple Watch.","I didn't fill all my rings every day for a year, which is incredibly impressive, but I felt inspired to share my story regardless.

In June of 2016, my son had turned two years old, and I weighed 276 pounds. I have strong memories of my own dad, always a bigger guy, who I would compete with when it came to eating. In other words, I was a kid, trying out-eat a grown man, and as an adult I wanted to be a better example for my son. It should come as no surprise that, decades later, my dad is suffering through things like Type 2 diabetes, he survived a heart attack, and in general he has a lot of trouble getting around. Looking at him, I knew that that was not how I wanted to live the later years of my own life.

I started out by consulting with a doctor, and developing an intensive diet change and exercising. I walked daily for 30-40 minutes, and with the modified intake, I saw my weight loss change dramatically at a pretty quick rate. 

By late October, only three months into my diet, I'd dropped about 50 pounds. I also found that my walk wasn't challenging anymore. Through using my Apple Watch, I always checked my heart rate while walking, doing my best to keep it above 125. However, there were points on my walk where, no matter how fast I went, I was unable to keep my rate that high - so, I just started running one day. It happened about two weeks before I turned 37. For literally the first time in my life, I ran one mile without stopping. Within two weeks, I was running 5K daily.

Within 10 months of my diet's start, I had dropped 100 pounds and hit my target weight. That was February of last year. Since then, like a lot of dieters, I've seen some weight come back, but I'm still in a healthy weight range and I still run every day. I owe my success to my Apple Watch - using it to track my fitness and close my circles, I've continued running, even in weather as cold as -26C. I've run through mounds of snow, on sheets of ice, in insane heat, on ridiculously humid days, you name it. 

I am now a year into being a healthy weight, and I am a good example to my son, who is now 3.5 years old. On a nearly nightly basis, he announces that he's going for a run, before he starts running circles around the main floor of our house. In a year or two, I will start taking him running for real. 

So, on top reaching a weight I'd not been at since I was 11 or 12, I've now run well over a thousand kilometres (probably approaching 2K soon). I've dramatically improved my blood pressure, my cholesterol, and my overall health. But most importantly, I've become a good example for my son. Hopefully, I will live a long healthy life, because I want to see as much of his as is possible. 

I owe a lot of my success to tracking calories on my iPhone, and tracking calories burned on my Apple Watch. Apple has done a great job with this product. It has literally changed my life.

apple,"I'm loving the HomePod with Homekit, but damn, Siri needs to get a lot smarter.","I've got a Google Home, which I love, but it sounds pretty muffled when it gets louder than 20%. I opted to grab a HomePod, despite personally objecting to how ""walled garden"" it is. I'll be honest, though, I've never owned a speaker that has sounded this nice before, and on that front, I'm very happy.

But man, you don't truly realize how disappointing Siri is until it's your primary way to communicate with a device. I've gotten very used to having conversational dialog with Google Home, not even just looking up facts and stuff, but allowing the device to figure out my context.

Siri fails at that probably 20-30% of the time. ""Hey Siri, set some mood lighting"", ""Hey Siri, skip the next two tracks."" ""Hey Siri, turn on my Apple TV"", ""Hey Siri, turn off the lights in 5 minutes.""

Requests like this simply don't work. And this is after having my HomePod for a grand total of one evening.

While I get that first and foremost the HomePod is a high quality speaker (and it really is, damn), but if you're going to include Siri, at least make it somewhat comparable to what Amazon and Google are offering.

I'm really hoping for a significant Siri update with iOS 12 (and parallel releases), because Siri is so much more useful when you have a screen to go along with it.

AppleWatch,Apple Watch may have saved my life,"I started getting  alerts on my watch back in December that my heart rate was over 120bpm    
After my wife convinced me this may be an issue I brought it up to my doctor in January. 

He agreed it may be an issue and had me see a cardiologist for a stress test. The stress test showed a “shadow” and due to the data in my watch he felt I should undergo a heart cath. 

I was reluctant to do this as he said he would normally treat this with medication and check again in a year but my daughter and wife both wanted me to proceed. 

I had the heart cath Friday the 23rd and they found a 70% occlusion in my Left Anterior Descending artery. Better known as the widow maker.
