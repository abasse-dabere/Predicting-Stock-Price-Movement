apple,A couple of quick tips for iTunes 11,"1: 

If you want to see the album covers in the ""Songs"" view (which was removed and then added again on 11.0.3), do this:

Go to **Music &gt; Songs**.

You'll see all your music with no artwork. 

Press **Command+J**: 

[ **✓** ] Show Artwork

[ **✓** ] Always show

------------------

2: 

If you want the search to behave the way it used to, click the magnifying glass in the search field and uncheck ""**Search Entire Library**"".

------------------

EDIT

3: 

I like to have lyrics ready, so I use [Get Lyrical](http://shullian.com/get_lyrical.php) (free) to put the lyrics in the entire library (most of it anyway). 

Then I use [DesktopLyrics](http://www.corecode.at/desktoplyrics) to display the lyrics and [artwork in the background like this](http://imgur.com/a/tCEGS). The version of DesktopLyrics that displays both the artwork and the lyrics in the background is paid, but there's an old [free version](http://www.corecode.at/desktoplyrics_lite/index.html) that works just as well, however it only displays the lyrics.

ipad,How do you create an iPad App without coding?,"This is the question that many of my clients that come from a traditional desktop publishing background are asking me. Because of this, I made a comprehensive online course about using Adobe InDesign and Creative Cloud to build your very own digital publication all wrapped up in a native iOS App that runs on the iPad. But before I go on blabbering about the course awesomeness, let me just say that I'm offering it up to the reddit community for FREE! The course is at [Essential-DPS](https://www.udemy.com/essential-adobedps/) and use the coupon code: **REDDIT4DPS** (which will apply a 100% discount and make it *free*).

Needless to say, it took a lot of time and effort to complete this course with over 45 lectures and 5 hours of content. It's built upon Udemy's powerful eLearning platform, and you can watch it online using your computer or iPad. Because of the length and quality of the content this course is regularly priced at $99.00 dollars, but I have created a special code for the reddit community to get it for free.

Please have a look and if you think this is something that might interest you, go ahead and give it whirl. If you like what you see, a nice positive review on there would be tremendously appreciated!

Thanks and I hope you guys find this useful. any thoughts or feedback is welcome!",19,111,2013-06-08,AAPL,0.014906020835042,0.9062557816505432,0.07883814722299576

Are the iOS 7 leaks true, what does the next OSX bring and will we be lucky enough to see some hardware. We'll have to find out tomorrow, bright and early.

iphone,iPhone/iOS first impressions (from an Android user),"Hey /r/iphone! 

I just wanted to give my 2 cents (okay, maybe more than 2 cents) from my first foray into the iphone ecosystem after having used android devices for the past 3 or so years. For reference, I moved from a Nexus 4 to an iphone 4s (The 4s was on a deal here in NZ and I took the chance) 

Firstly, I noticed just how smooth and fluid the OS/apps is/are in general. It seems like a polished OS, and although the Nexus 4 was great running stock android and I hardly got any lags or hiccups, using iOS and the majority of the apps I have downloaded so far (Alien Blue being one of the first, and wow it kicks ass), they seem to run more ... 'well' than their android counterparts. One of my favourites is iMessage. The seamlessness of it all is amazing, and no tinkering or major setting up required :)

Secondly, the battery life is much, much better doing basically the same tasks. My nexus 4 lasted around 2.5 - 3 hours screen on time during a typical day, and suffered from an Android OS battery drain when connected to WiFi. The iPhone 4s just keeps going and going, and the recharge time is much faster as well. 

On the flip side, I have missed a few things from the Android UI. Firstly, toggles for connectivity in the notification bar. It has become a habit for me to switch data off when im home, or when I connect to WiFi generally. It just appears to be a chore to go into Settings &gt; General &gt; Cellular &gt; Off when I could have done the same thing on my Nexus in 2 Steps, and the same applies for WiFi, bluetooth etc. I hope this issue is addressed in a few days with iOS 7, because I dont really want to jailbreak a device, that is, for all other purposes, excellent. 

As an aside, I thought when downgrading from a 4.7"" screen to a 3.5"" screen, I would take a long time adjusting to the lack of screen real estate. However, I think that the upsides of owning a small with a small but very good screen is that one handed use becomes possible! I have never used a phone one handed, and to be able to quickly reply to a text without having to use two hands is a blessing. Also, the small form factor really helps with the portability, and in my opinion, I havent felt that a smaller screen lacks when browsing apps/the web. 

All in all, i'm liking what the iPhone and iOS has to offer. Although I appreciate both OS'es, the change is refreshing and I think I may stick to this side of the river for a while yet! Thanks for reading :)",74,76,2013-06-09,AAPL,0.028549697250127792,0.9143268465995789,0.057123467326164246

As cynical, unappreciative; and absolutely, intolerably insatiable you people typically are, it's truly a miracle that the most complained about issue I read about is that you don't like the Safari icon.

You should not have the software on your phone in the first place and second, you are not suppose to be disclosing info to the public. It is absolutely dumb to ask for fixes to problems while any software is in beta. The risks associated with updating to iOS 7 should have been weighed BEFORE updating and now that you do have it, don't expect help when it has been clearly stated that this was not meant to be a public release.

iphone,"Just sold my Lumia 920 and came back to iPhone. Those who left and came back, why did you?","I got the 920 in January after having an iPhone 4 for over two years with no problems. I went through three 920's and decided I couldn't deal any longer, cancelled my contract and got a 5 under my boyfriends account. Here are the mains reasons I had to come back:

•Lack of apps, interested developers, and support. 
•Microsoft boasts how awesome their live tiles are, but they themselves don't even bother to create many for their own native apps. 
•Purchased music from XBox music is nearly impossible to transfer between different devices. (Not to mention I had to navigate through pointless animations and apps to play said music.)
•There isn't anyway to purchase videos of any kind on the device. 
•Pandora and apps like it would eat up my data plan even when I had stopped them (this is a known bug and there is an app to kill all the music processes but a person shouldn't have to do that.)
•Microsoft's ""in-and-out"" philosophy is crap. If you missed a notification you would have to search your never ending start screen hoping the tile is actually working and showing the notification. 
•Many apps lack basic functionality. For instance, 98% of the apps that play videos do not allow you a slider to chose a specific time in the video. You have to fast forward, wait for it to buffer, and then fast forward again, hoping you don't pass up what you were looking for, thus having to rewind back. It's just a pain in the butt. Oh, and one very annoying feature, screen brightness has three options. None of which are very different from the other. 
•And lastly (for this list anyway, and aside from the many bugs and lack of support to fix these bugs), the battery.  A day of good use would lead to the phone dying by 6PM. They push this ""battery saver"" feature but there shouldn't even be a need for one, and if there is one it should work. And don't think you can just plug it in for 30 or so minutes and power through the rest of the day, when the Lumia needs charged its going to take at least a few hours to get to 50% battery. 

This might come off as rant-ish but I'm just so glad to be rid of WP and back to the land of iOS.",200,269,2013-06-30,AAPL,0.048130735754966736,0.9133735299110413,0.03849569335579872
