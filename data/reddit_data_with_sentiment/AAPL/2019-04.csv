Called ER, when they arrived, they found me in serious trouble. Body went into shock, got rushed to the hospital in a stretcher, and got taken into trauma.

I felt totally fine before everything happened, and then notifications, and then BAM, everything goes nuts.

100% thank you apple for making an amazing accessory and tool that helps people stay not dead.

Update 1: doctor just swung by, said that when I was picked up by the paramedics, I was suffering tachycardia, they gave me an IV and put me on oxygen, and applied EAD pads to my torso. Fortunately they never needed to be used, but I passed out in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Woke up in a hospital bed, and at this point the docs are just awaiting some results and such. Apparently I should be clear to leave, but have an appointment scheduled with a cardiologist tomorrow.

Update 2: me and my IV thingy after being moved to a waiting room - https://imgur.com/a/YuVgVCQ

Update 3: Doc swung by with my ECG and noted that while all the chambers of the heart were beating like they should, they were doing so at an abnormally fast rate. Got schedule me to see a Cardiologist tomorrow.

Update 4: Doctor says it was SVT, and scheduled me for an ECHO (I think?) and took some more blood after I’d recovered and been at rest for a few hours to check for any issues with my thyroid. Been discharged from the hospital but am to return tomorrow afternoon.

Final Update: was fitted with one of those 24-hour heart monitors after an echocardiogram, doctors concluded that the issue was due to nerves(?) not doing their job and delivering weak signals, received the option for a pacemaker or mandatory (supervised) cardio exercise to strengthen the heart.",590,6819,2019-04-06,AAPL,0.04319046065211296,0.9214158654212952,0.03539368882775307

AppleWatch,"For those wondering, YES the AW Series 4 detects falls from a bicycle / motorbike","Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the series 4 after destroying my series 2 in a silly motorbike crash.  
I was wondering if the Series 4 could detect falling from a bicycle or motorbike, but of course didn't really want to try it out.

Well, now I know it does.

I was riding at a normal pace, leaned into a turn and lost the grip in the front. It wasn't a huge crash, I basically fell from the bike and slid on the road something like 15-20 meters, and stood up immediately thanks to the adrenaline. Went to pick up my noble steed, and sat on the side of the road to calm down a bit. 

I heard a voice saying ""Hello ? Can you hear me ?"", and was confused. I then realised my watch had called the emergency services, after detecting the fall.  I completely forgot I had it on my wrist, and didn't dismiss the alert.

After talking about it with a friend who also owns a S4, he told me he fell off his bicycle in an accident involving a car, and the watch also detected the fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, it wasn't too bad, but were it worse, it might have saved my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you Apple.

Here's some backstory regarding this Sudoku app.

I originally started working on this app last year summer time. While working on it, my code got quite messy and I ended up abandoning it. Then I returned back to it in October last year and started from scratch again. I worked on it for 2 months and I got frustrated again. 

This was mostly because I don't have much experience with coding games and code was getting quite messy. Plus I wasn't satisfied with the UI of my app and thought it looked pretty ugly. I was also being too ambitious with the app as I was trying to make it support dual-player where 2 people could play on the same sudoku board. This was quite difficult as firstly it required a server backend, which despite me having backend experience, was quite hard to implement as it needed 2 phones to be always in sync with each other. Also from some additional research, I found that there actually wasn't much interest in dual player sudoku. So my code base was getting super bloated with having to support dual player - something which wasn't even much desired by many people. 

Another thing wrong with these 2 prior attempts was that I had wasted a lot of time trying to get Python working on iOS. The Sudoku puzzle generation logic was written in Python (not mine, I was using an open sourced one) and when a new game started, I would run the Python script on iOS, generate a new puzzle and so on. [I have described how to do this in one of my reddit comments before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/93mqhe/how_to_run_functions_from_python_libraries_in_an/e3fdgpf/?st=jsdp5o2y&amp;sh=b29889cc) This itself took me about 2 weeks to figure out and was a complete pain in the ass. Plus it also falls in a gray area of Apple's review system as they are usually not too fond if you running such scripts in your app. So it risked getting rejected in app review. The puzzles generated by the python script were also not ""hard"" enough. 

So I ended up scrapping the whole thing.

So I started it again on around January 20th, again from scratch. Fortunately, having built the app to 75% completetion twice already and abandoning it, I had plenty of code logic which I could reuse after some clean up. This also gave me an opportunity to redesign the UI to make it less ugly. Instead of running the python script on iOS to generate the puzzles, I pre-generated 50,000 puzzles (10,000 for each difficulty) on my Mac and included them in my app.

I go by 80/20 law as 80% of the work was pretty much done in 1 week in this third attempt. Then I spent the next week mostly on settings, theme customization etc. I was finally able to finish this app and submitted it. When it comes to such projects, perseverance is the key to completition. I was stuck many times, the UI wasn't up to my self-imposed standards etc. The 3 re-attempts helped me fix those issues and finally get the thing out of the door. Even though I said ""wasted nights"" in my title, I don't really consider them a waste as I learnt lots of new things in those wasted hours. I think I am content with what I have built and am ready to share it with you guys! Hope you like it!

------------

In case you are curious what differentiates my app from other hundreds of sudoku apps out there:

1.	My opinion is ofcourse biased but I do think I have a nicer looking UI and UX in my app.

2.	Haptic feedback - when you enter a correct or incorrect answer, you feel different vibrations in the app using the haptic engine. I thought this was really required to give a feeling of ""small step to success"" towards completetion of the puzzle.

3.	Themes and customizations to make the app as close to how you like it as possible. The dark AMOLED themes is my personal favorite as it looks super crisp.

4.	Unfair and Extreme level of puzzles are actually super hard (at last that's my and couple of my testers' experience). 

5.	After a game is finished, you get your overall stats like total time spent, best time, average time, overall score, hints used, mistakes made etc. I personally haven't found any other app present all these stats at the end of a game in a ""pretty"" way.

6.	[My app also comes with a graph of how your scores progress over time.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zxrqqu24lgp437i/ScreenRecording_02-13-2019%2016-56-10.MP4?dl=0) As you play more difficult levels, you get more score. Each higher level gives twice the number of points as the previous level. 

7.	Sudoku Extreme can automatically pre-fill the notes and auto-remove them when they are used in a row, column or block. I personally encorage disabling this setting and filling it manually as it makes your brain more active! Also if you fill them manually, you get extra points when you finish the game!

8.	The quick fill feature lets you tap-and-hold a number and then simply tap cells and it will fill it with that number.

9.	Numbers show how many instances of that number are left to be filled in the puzzle. When a number has been used 9 times correctly, it hides itself. You can disable this setting if you like.

10. [Pleasing animations when you fill an entire row, column or block as well as when you finish games!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b15isgklx6gn1dl/ScreenRecording_02-13-2019%2016-53-37.MP4?dl=0) I thought this was essential to make the app as engaging as possible.

11. Lots of great feedback from the /r/sudoku, /r/iOSProgramming and /r/AppHookups subreddits.

12. Swipe up/down to enter notes numbers (setting needs to be switched on)

13. No ads!

Anyway, this is obviously my biased opinion about my app. I am curious to hear what feedback you guys have! Let me know if there is any feedback or any questions about the development process!

I plan on sending an update which includes global leaderboards in the app in the upcoming days.

apple,"iPhone users, do you use the “Look Up” feature?","Hey guys. I’m trilingual but only began mastering English a few years ago. Now I’m just working on increasing my vocabulary, but I struggle to memorize new words when I encounter them while reading books or even reddit. I often look up a definition of a word on my iPhone, but shortly after I forget the meaning. 

I came up with the idea of an app acting as a Library to all the words that are looked up using the iPhone feature. I didn’t find anything similar in App Store, so I’m developing one myself. 

Look Up button has been pretty useful for me personally but I don’t know whether many people use it. Please feel free to check it out and give honest feedback or simply subscribe for updates if you like it.

apple,iPhone XR vs. XS vs. XS Max,"I've now used all three (long story) for at least two weeks each and here are my thoughts for those deciding between them. My focus is size, display, and battery life.

**iPhone XR**

* Fantastic battery life (~2 days with my usage patterns)
* Display, standing alone, is great. If you stick it next to the high PPI OLED of the XS phones you'll definitely notice a difference in color saturation, sharpness, and contrast.
* Lack of 3D Touch is a negative for me, but not a dealbreaker (for me)
* Size and thickness makes it feel rather large (👀) and one-handed use is difficult


**iPhone XS**

* Battery life is good as I can almost always make it through the day
* Display is great
* Size is great -- big screen but device is still pocketable and mostly comfortable to use one-handed


**iPhone XS Max**

* Great battery life (~1.5 days for me)
* Display is great
* Large, but narrower width (compared to the 7/8 Plus) makes it not as cumbersome to hold. Can't use it one-handed and that's my biggest gripe.
* Great for video consumption


I'm ultimately going to stick with the XS as I think it's the best all-around device for my needs. If you don't want to spend the extra $250, the XR is still a great overall package. If you spend a lot of time consuming media on your phone I recommend the XS Max.",101,267,2019-04-14,AAPL,0.021915828809142113,0.9267523288726807,0.05133190006017685

AppleWatch,The Apple Watch is simply an amazing device.,"I just went on a run for about 20 minutes, running with only my Watch and my Airpods I just got today.

On my run:

• My Watch was keeping me connected via cellular, and keeping me safe while running at night, with the Emergency SOS feature on standby.

• My Watch was tracking my GPS location and mapping my run.

• My Watch was non-stop monitoring my Heart Rate.

• It was streaming music to my Airpods with no interruptions at all.

• It was gathering and compiling tons of workout data such as active/total calories, my average cadence and pace, and my elevation gain.

All of this on a device that fits on my wrist.

It’s honestly insane... and it’s even more insane that devices such as this are normal in today’s world. What’s it going to be like in even the next 5 or 10 years?

apple,Apple should create its own “login with Facebook/google” tool for websites and NOT share the data.,"I’ve been reading [Zucked](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525561358/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_-x6UCbTFR0YFX) about how terrible Facebook is with data privacy and security. One of the ways they (and google) harvest data is by giving people the ability to login to websites using their f/g account. Those websites do this to harvest more data for their nefarious purposes. ([don’t do this, btw](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/technology/personaltech/facebook-log-in-hack.html))

This seems like an opportunity for Apple to create a relatively simple tool that could serve the same function but not collect the data. It would be a great shot across the bow  to these companies, and providing a service without the downsides. I think It would make people more trusting of Apple.

AppleWatch,Apple Watch should inform you if not connected with iPhones,"It would be a nice feature if Apple Watch gave you a notification when it's disconnected with the iPhone. For example, you're at a restaurant and put your iPhone on the table. You leave the restaurant and forget your iPhone on the table (nearly happened to me today). So as soon as the watch recognizes it's not connected with the iPhone anymore it alarms you that the iPhone is not nearby (sound and vibration).

And if you do want to leave your iPhone at home e.g. for doing a workout with the LTE version, you could just disable the alarm.

Do you think something like that would be possible to implement? And do you think this is a necessary feature or don't you agree with me?",88,638,2019-04-21,AAPL,0.037681564688682556,0.9123517274856567,0.0499667227268219

apple,"Last year I bought my 82 year old, Serbian grandmother an iPad.","As the title says, last year I bought my 82 year old grandmother an iPad. She never owned a smart device before, she never touched a computer and I don't think she knew what ""the internet"" was.

It was my fathers idea to get her that iPad. Thanks to me, my dad became a huge fan of Apple devices and since both he and I spend the majority of our time overseas he thought it would be a good idea to get my grandmother an iPad so they could face time and he could show her where he is etc.

TBH I thought it was an incredibly stupid idea. My grandmother is an Eastern European, ex communist country simple, old woman. Imagine old grandmothers from funny ""a normal day in Russia"" clips and gifs, that's what she looks like. First 15 years of her life she spent in a village that had no electricity. Over the last 30 years we've spent more time talking about her inability to handle a tv remote than anything else. 

So I made a deal with my dad that yes, I'll buy it and take it to her but I won't be involved in teaching her how to use it, that's on him.

To cut the story short, at first there were issues, she was pressing the screen in extremely awkward ways and it took her a week or two to simply learn how to touch the screen, how to drag the finger etc but she did learn.

My dad explained how everything works slowly, talking with her on the phone, patiently teaching her what to do step by step. A few months later she was texting me through iMessage, she was typing and sending messages, then she started using emojis. First time I got an emoji from her I had to call and make sure it was actually her who did it. 

There were a few comical setbacks. Once she turned on ""airplane"" mode by accident and my dad couldn't explain to her how to turn it off so I had to travel 3 hours (we don't live in the same city) just to turn it off.

Then she learned how to use the camera, she took and sent us pictures of her garden and the weather and the telephone bill and all kinds of other shit. She learned how to google different recipes, how to read local news, how to use google maps, youtube. It was all very clumsy but she made it work.

Last week the iPad stopped charging, it's at the repair shop right now. She just called me and told me how much money she has and asked if that's enough for a new iPad because it's been days and she doesn't want to be without it anymore.

And even though I did try to describe what my grandmother is like I think that out of respect and love towards her I still understated just how unlikely it is that a person like her managed to learn how to use a modern tech device. 

It made me appreciate just how great of a product the iPad is. How great the design, the way the device works, is.",206,4764,2019-04-28,AAPL,0.029842277988791466,0.9272206425666809,0.04293700307607651
