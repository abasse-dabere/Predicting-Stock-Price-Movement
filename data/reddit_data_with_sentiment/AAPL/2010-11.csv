apple,"Avoiding the DST bug (for people who've already switched, and for the US switching next week)","So as Europe discovered today (and Oz discovered a few weeks ago), there is a DST bug with recurring alarms in iOS4: the alarm goes off 1h too late in some cases.

It is important to understand when this bug occurs, because it doesn't occur all the time.

## 1. It doesn't occur for non-recurring alarms

If you like having a routine, you can just use non-recurring alarms until the bug is fixed, as long as you remember to re-set them there should be no trouble

## 2. It does *not* occur if your alarm recurs every single day

If you select a recurring alarm for all days of the week, you should not have any issue

## 3. Unless the alarm was created before the switch?

I can not confirm this, but there are reports that alarms created before the DST switch, even if they occur each day of the week, will be buggy. You might want to create a non-recurring alarm to wake up after the DST switch just in case

## 4. Recurring alarms which aren't set on every day of the week are broken

This means weekday alarms to go to work or weekend alarms (for whatever reason) *will not work correctly* and will be off 1h.

## 5. Apple where is the fucking fix?

Nobody knows, according to Apple Australia the fix is done and will be rolled out, but it is likely it'll only be rolled out in November with iOS 4.2, which means it will be rolled out *after* everybody has switched and is pissed off [0]

Please pass this along to your iPhone-toting friends and colleagues if you're in the Americas and in a DST-observing country.

[0] this is definitely an argument for small, over-the-air updates to the OS rather than big ""let's replace everything at once"" roll-outs of OS updates.",3,11,2010-11-01,AAPL,0.10062350332736969,0.8717008829116821,0.02767559513449669

iphone,"Switching from iPhone 3g to Captivate, then back to iPhone 4","Like many 3G owners I was irked at the performance of my phone after the ""upgrade"" to iOS4. This topped with all the news of the whole antenna issue I decided to make the switch to Android.

I had the Captivate for 29.5 days and returned it. The phone itself was very solid and the screen was beautiful, though not in direct sunlight.

My first week with the phone was joyous. Rooting it, and tweaking the interface, installing widgets and doing all the things I couldn't do on the iPhone.

I soon started seeing issues with the phone. The time widgets weren't updating, I wasn't getting email, and I couldn't find a good app to sync my podcasts and music with. Songbird, Double Twist and TuneSync all proved to suck, especially on OSX.

Long story short, I spent too much time tweaking, troubleshooting and admining my phone that I felt like I was using Windows 95 again. 

I don't hate android nor the Galaxy S phones. I just think that Android is not the mature product that iOS is. The Android Market is crap, though, App Brain has it's shit together, but still the apps pretty much suck.

That all being said, I will probably get one of the Android tablets next year.

mac,Note to self: Don't accidentally drag and drop over 4000 files to the Desktop - How to recover a crashed Finder,"Not wanting to run the risk of losing my precious iPhoto libabry, when I recently did a reinstall of OS Snow Leopard, I took the precaution of opening up the iPhoto library via right-click &gt; Show Package Contents and manually copied the RAW and JPEG image files directly onto a remote drive.

But rather than being patient when it came to dragging and dropping the whole mess back onto iPhoto, after reinstalling the OS, I left hold of the mouse button too early and accidentally started copying all 4000+ files onto the Desktop.

After having no choice but to force the computer to restart, things then got worse after reboot when Finder tried to display the 1000+ image icons that had already been copied to the Desktop which had successfully copied themselves over while Finder was hanging, previous to my forcing a restart.  This left the boot-up procedure unable to complete and I had no way of launching Finder to rescue it from itself.

So I did something I've never done before but was surprised to find how easy it was, so I'm passing it along to you.

If Finder gets stuck on something that won't allow you to boot normally—or boot for long enough to fix something that prevents normal operation—boot from the OS X installer CDROM and choose Terminal from the Utilities menu.

Even though you can't see any of your hard drives on the desktop (because the installer CDROM doesn't launch Finder) you can still mount and unmount your connected hard drives from inside Disk Utilities and Terminal.

In Terminal type:

    cd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD
    
to navigate to the folder or folders you think are causing the issue.  In my case it was the Desktop folder in my user directory.  Once there I used the UNIX command mv to move all image files to another folder, like so, after first creating the target folder with the command mkdir:

    mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/JPEGMoved
    mv *.jpg /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/JPEGMoved
    mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/RawMoved
    mv *.crw /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/RawMoved

You can then reboot as normal and everything inadvertently moved to the Desktop will have been moved into a folder inside your main Macintosh HD, in this case named RawMoved and JPEGMoved, or whatever you chose to name it with the mkdir command

ipad,"Getting my wife an iPad for Xmas, need advice...","I was wondering what /r/ipad thinks about the likeliness of a new iPad being announced or even released before the end of the year. I know there's been some rumours that it would coincide with the 4.2 iOS release, adding facetime and no doubt some other awesomeness. The real question is, how long do I wait to find out?

Trying to balance two risks... one, that they do announce a new one and it either doesn't get released in time (which given the expected holiday sales would seem strange) or I am unable to get one, or two, that I wait too long, nothing is announced, and stock disappears of the regular one in the lead up to the aforementioned holiday shopping.

Any thoughts?

iphone,Indispensable apps?,"What apps have become indispensable in your life?  

I've become an appaholic with 5 or 6 app finder apps I use regularly, two of which (""Free App A Day"" and ""Open Feint"") offer free apps every day.  

One that I use most often (besides ""Alien Blue"", of course) is, surprisingly, ""Martha's Everyday Food"".  I'd never been a Martha Stewart fan, but downloaded her app when I was looking for something to make grocery shopping easier.  This app supplies a new recipe every day, has a recipe database (nice in that you can add any recipe found on the web), allows you to search her website for recipes, and has an integrated and customizable shopping list.  The shopping list is easily shared because it is integrated with the ""Zip List"" website.  You can add to the (already huge) shopping list database via manual entry or by barcode scan.

The daily recipes are mostly to my family's taste, and include a nice selection of authentic international dishes.  They're relatively healthy, usually tasty, and consist of 1-pot meals (meaning entree &amp; side dishes included) that you can make in less than an hour.  Now, I simply decide which recipes I'm going to use for the week and my shopping list is automatically created.  No more frustration because I find out at the last minute that I'm lacking one important ingredient to finish cooking a meal!

Negatives?  1.  It's hard to keep the list open while I'm shopping...but that's more an iPhone problem.  2. Data entry for the items database could/should be better designed.

apple,Why can't we test apps before buying them.,"I honestly wish that there was a way that you could test the app before buying it. I'm not talking about all the .99 cent apps of really anything under 9.99 but I think apps that cost more than 9.99 should be testable or at the least refundable within a certain amount of time. I need to get a psychiatry encyclopaedia and I'm looking at the oxford app and it's $59.99 now I'm willing to pay for it if the app is of good quality but there are NO reviews at all. 

I really feel Apple should either make a way to be able to download an app without paying for it for like 5 minutes and then it erases itself or something. I realize that wouldn't really be worth Apple's time but another alternative would be for Apple (I don't even know if this is possible) to make a way for a user to use/test the app through a simulator or emulator (whatever it's called) on itunes for a preset amount of time. Again that may take up to many resources to hardly make it worth doing. But I REALLY hope at some point Apple addresses this issue because at the moment there are at least three apps over $60.00 I am looking at but am much to scared to purchase. 

Edit: I don't really know why but it seems every reply I make within this thread is receiving downvotes I don't exactly know why as no one has argued with me over anything and if you are downvoting my comments because you either don't like iPhones or you think the idea is stupid please don't.

Now, whenever my external hard drive isn't plugged in, I have to sort through the songs and try to remember which ones are actually on the computer. Usually, this results in an annoying little ""?"" popping up next to the song title and you getting a prompt to locate the file.

I have no idea how this impacts long term sales or in-app purchases but at least this is a strong indicator that there's still strength in the IP.

While you can never attribute success to just a single factor, at least Reddit played some part in helping this happen. :)

The game is still free for another 24 hours at the writing of this, so you can still pick it up if you didn't already do it, and let us know how we can make it even more fun. It's a niche game so it will never be for everyone, but at least now you can try it out risk-free.

ipad,iOS 4.2.1 Review/Recommendation,"So I was sick and tired of waiting for the official release of 4.2.1 iOS for the iPad. I could care less about it for my iPhone because the 4.1 version already has all the features I wanted. Anyway, the features I really wanted for the iPad was the consolidated inbox as well as the multitasking ability. 

After upgrading, I HIGHLY recommend that everyone updates their iPad to iOS 4.2.1 as well. It was extremely simple, no UUID is needed. Here are the bare-bone instructions. Again, like I said, you DO NOT need a password or whatever to install iOS 4.2.1 because it's in it's GM phase. ANYONE can download and install this. 

1. download iOS 4.2.1 (google it)
2. Plug your iPad into your computer.
3. Hold down ""Left-shift"" and press ""Restore"" on iTunes.
4. Click the iOS 4.2.1 file that you downloaded.
5. Hug yourself for a job well done.  

In addition, because this is the GM release (yeah I'm aware 4.2 was the original GM release) this is exactly what you're going to download when it officially gets released whenever Apple's slow ass decides to do this. In addition, because iTunes was updated in prep for the release of the original iOS 4.2, it even recognizes 4.2.1 as the most up to date version and installing apps via iTunes posed no trouble. I've included a pic below. 

[URL=""https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/iPad%204.2.1.png?w=9e525229""]https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/iPad%204.2.1.png?w=9e525229[/URL]

My thoughts on iOS 4.2.1 is nothing but positive. I did a FRESH reinstall, meaning I deleted everything from my iPad and installed everything again. Honestly, this was a huge hassle for me because of all the tweeking I did to my iPad but nonetheless, it still wasn't too bad. 

Maybe it was because I did a complete fresh install of iOS 4.2.1, maybe it's because I'm the shit, but iOS 4.2.1 was just as responsive and fast as the previous version (iOS 3.2.2 I believe). With multiple applications open and couple tabs on my browser, I couldn't notice any difference between iOS 3.2.2 and the new iOS 4.2.1. I know there have been some complaints from people regarding slow response times, lag, etc. but I have yet to witness any of these things. Therefore, I would highly recommend a fresh reinstall. As a side note, it doesn't matter if you have a PC or a Mac, every once in a while, your computer, iPad, iPhone needs a fresh reinstall to clean up all the shit it accumulated. 

In conclusion, I'd highly recommend installing iOS 4.2.1. It makes the iPad so much better.

apple,"My iPhone 4's camera lens is terribly scratched.  Is this a stupid design, or am I being dumb? (link in text)","Let me start by saying that I'm neither an Apple fanatic, nor do I hate Apple.  I just thought the iPhone had a really nice user interface, so I got the 3GS and have been extremely happy with it.  I only mention this because while browsing various Apple-related forums about my problem, anyone who complained about Apple was quickly identified as a completely irrational Apple-hating moron and ignored.  I promise, I like Apple products, I really do, but this problem has me scratching my head.

**The Problem:**  My wife's iPhone 4's back camera lens is scratched all to heck and back, to the point that the pictures it takes look blurry.  Neither of us could really figure out how it got that way, because she's only had it a couple of weeks.  This is her first really nice cell phone, and she ***really*** hates the idea of having to pay any extra amount of money due to carelessness, so she has been extremely careful with it.  And I mean really careful; we're talking Fabergé egg filled with babies and nukes careful, here.  She only carries it around in her purse, in a pocket all by itself, which is lined with soft fabric.  We've been looking at cases for it, but we haven't picked one yet.

Anyway, when I got to looking at it, I realized that the glass or whatever it is that covers the camera hole is actually raised slightly above anything else on the back of the phone.  This means that any time the phone is set down on its back on a desk or something, the lens cover is making direct contact with that surface.  Here are some pictures showing what I mean:

[Images showing the lens cover is scratched and raised](http://i.imgur.com/YfoPt.jpg)

[Picture taken with my iPhone 3GS](http://i.imgur.com/bN8ZY.jpg)

[Similar picture taken with my wife's iPhone 4](http://i.imgur.com/kuFaI.jpg)

That seems kinda dumb to me.  I mean, wouldn't it have been better to make the lens cover thingy just a teensy bit recessed rather than raised?

**Update:** I took it to the Apple store and they swapped out the back plate.  Here's a picture of the new one:

[New camera lens cover](http://i.imgur.com/fQGsL.jpg)

The lens cover still looks a bit raised above everything else, but it's not as pronounced as the old one.  Also, the lens is scratch free, so I'm happy.  This thing will be living in a case from now on, so this problem shouldn't happen again.

Thanks for all the info/help!

apple,"Just got it working now, how to record on a Mac.","I just figured this a few minutes ago, how to record streaming Audio.

1. Download [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), it's a simple (not to mention free and open source) audio editor that's quite handy for the general purpose, nonspecific job.
2. Download [SoundFlower](http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/), it's a (free) system extension that allows audio to pass from one app to another.
3. Install both, of course.
4. System Preferences &gt; Sound &gt; Output &gt; Soundflower, either 2ch or 16ch.
5. Audacity &gt; Preferences &gt; Audio I/O tab &gt; Recording &gt; Device, either 2ch or 16ch, it must match the channel (2ch or 16ch) in Soundflower from step 4.
6. Profit. Well not really.

Audio quality obviously is not amazing, but it works in a pinch. The volume matters here, if you record on a low level volume, you will get a low level recording.

Your mileage may vary, use at your own discretion and risk.

**EDIT**

greatblackowl has offered a tip:

&gt;To maximize the volume without overloading, go to ""effect -&gt; normalize."" Obviously, the best option would be to start with a high-volume input, though.

**EDIT2**

Or you can just go buy Audio Hijack Pro.

I just used Audacity cause I'm more familiar with it and I use it often.

apple,Some features that need to be added to iTunes,"After much wailing and gnashing of teeth I have finally given up on Amarok and other OSS music players and switched to iTunes. iTunes is a much more robust and stable music player than Amarok, and I don't have to worry about it becoming neglected or abandoned by it's developers.  Still there are some features that I am amazed are not in iTunes and that I'm hoping will find their way into it soon... I'll be wishing upon a star that somebody on the iTunes dev team reads this.

1. Secondary Sort - So many uses for this option. For me, it would make the process of deleting duplicate songs much faster and easier.

2. A true queue function. iTunes DJ is ok, but still not as good as the queues we could make in Amarok or even Winamp 10 years ago.

3. Stop after Current Song. This is a feature I use all the time. I guess I have a bit of OCD when it comes to stopping play in the middle of a song. The queue and stop after current song functions are a great combo, allowing more convenient creation of impromptu playlists.

I took that to mean that you can *use* your free account on any device running 4.2, but you have to *create* the account on a new iWhatever. It turns out that this is correct. My wife and I both have the iPhone 3G, and after updating to 4.2, I was able to use the free MobileMe account I had created on my iPad to set up Find My iPhone on both of them.

apple,Can I use Time Machine to restore my personal documents but not OS settings?,"I want to restore my macbook back to a clean SL install, but want to use Time Machine for parts of this to help speed things along.

Say I reinstalled SL now, would I be able to use TM to restore my documents, music, downloads etc whilst it leaves all the programs, program settings, OS settings alone? I just don't want to have a clean install and then it restore the old settings that I am trying to be rid of.

Thanks.",17,21,2010-11-29,AAPL,0.023914029821753502,0.9256599545478821,0.050426021218299866
