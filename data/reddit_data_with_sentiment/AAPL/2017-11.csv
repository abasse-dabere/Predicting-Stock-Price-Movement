apple,"Possibilities with FaceID - ""For my eyes only""-Mode","With [this current thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7a9lfe/suggestion_faceid_shouldnt_show_notification/) in mind I thought about some other ways FaceID could be usefull in the long run.

I guess there is no doubt that FaceID will become the standard authentication method from iPhone to Mac in the next years.

How cool would it be, if there was a ""For my eyes only"" mode.

Right now we have a hidden photos folder in Photos, locked notes and maybe complex folder structures to hide some apps we dont want anyone to see.

With FaceID it could be possible to assign a ""For my eyes only""-Tag. As soon as FaceID notices someone else looking at the screen but me...say my buddy is scrolling through my photo library...iOS would immediatly hide all tagged items. Not even a placeholder, but completely gone.

This could extend to contacts, chats, browser history, reminders, calenders etc.

If they are not your eyes that are looking at the phone, there will be no information.

You could let someone use your phone without the fear of them ""accidentally"" stumbeling on some nasty duck pics in the camera roll.",134,843.0,2017-11-02,AAPL,0.02815094031393528,0.9431025981903076,0.028746454045176506

&gt;Wireless charging uses magnetic induction to charge your iPhone. Don't place anything between your iPhone and the charger. Magnetic mounts, magnetic cases, or other objects between your iPhone and the charger might reduce performance or damage magnetic strips or RFID chips like those found in some credit cards, security badges, passports, and key fobs. If your case holds any of these sensitive items, remove them before charging or make sure that they aren’t between the back of your iPhone and the charger.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlc3hAe6i8

In this video iPhone 6s Plus (2GB of RAM) wins against Galaxy S7 (4GB of RAM) by keeping every app open when Galaxy S7 struggled. 

Fast forward today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL99tRQR9W0

Galaxy Note 8 won against both iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X because 3GB of RAM struggles to keep a bunch of apps open which was never a problem due to iOS optimization, but they changed something in iOS 11 which hurts the RAM management.


**EDIT** ****

A lot of people think that I'm using wrong videos for comparisons, and to be honest I was just lazy to look for the videos where he uses the same exact same apps, because I was at work, anyways I understand that the testing method and apps matter, so here are a few examples where the same testing methods and apps were used, where the iPhone kept all of them ready to go in the background.

Do note I'm not worshipping iPhone and getting triggered over the fact that it lost, it lost previously to One Plus 5 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQtCeAJBp1A) due to slower animations on iOS, BUT the RAM management was flawless.

* Android has a status bar and optional multicolored LED indicator.
* [Notifications in the shade](https://i.imgur.com/jgCBymo.png) can rearrange and resize based on content or user preferences. 
* Multiple notifications from the same app can be [summarized](https://i.imgur.com/pkCzrPU.png) or [grouped](https://i.imgur.com/fzKlpT8.png) and expanded.
* (edit) Multiple notifications within the same message thread will just update that one notification, with the recent messages view able upon expansion (will add an example soon).
* [Inline notification replies](https://i.imgur.com/OAFMQPV.mp4) keep the notification the same size.
* App developers have to [set notification channels](https://i.imgur.com/ksNXPBh.png) that define the importance and type of notification; these channels can be activated or deactivated individually by the user and each level of importance alerts the user i different ways. 
* [Ambient display notifications](https://i.imgur.com/XH7ZlzY.png) keep the screen dim and fill the screen for a brief period when they arrive.
* (edit) Notifications stay on your lock screen and status bar until they are opened or dismissed. Lock the device and all the notifications that were there will still be there.
* Media from multiple simultaneous apps can [be controlled through notifications](https://i.imgur.com/UH5xwYq.png)
* [Colored notifications](https://i.imgur.com/p7ifFcP.jpg) help distinguish content.
* (edit) Notifications can also have actionable buttons besides ""reply."" [Here is an example of a timer notification](https://i.imgur.com/G9zoiB5.png) where the user can pause or add time.

# Background

I was reading [this thread](https://redd.it/7byc9s) earlier to and got the feeling iOS users were unsatisfied with their notifications. Some users brought up Android's notifications as an example of a good system but many either haven't experienced notifications on Android or had misconceptions about how they are handled.

Some comments:

&gt; Just tell them to copy Android and then alter it slightly with some webOS flair.

&gt;&gt; Can you be more specific? Other than grouping by app, what’s so great about Android notifications?

-

&gt; It's not complicated. Just have it be more like Android and less like whatever it is now. It's pretty safe to say that Google has had it figured out for a while now.

-

&gt; I think its hard to explain, you really just have to own an Android phone for a while and use it to appreciate really how great the notification system is.

-

That's where this post comes in. I'm not here to convert anybody. I used an iPhone for most my life and completely acknowledge the advantages. Both Android and iOS can improve by studying one another and taking the best from both.

---

# Android's System

Most of this is lifted and consolidated from[ Google's Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/notifications.html) so you can read it in full there. I'll try and keep my points to the system not the style.

## How notifications may be noticed

* Showing a status bar icon
* Appearing on the lock screen
* Playing a sound or vibrating
* Peeking onto the current screen
* Blinking the device's LED

The two obvious differences are the LED and status bar. 

The LED is an optional hardware component (actually off by default on some phones like the Pixel) that simply blinks colors depending on your most recent notification; this is actually a huge* deal [to many Android users](https://redd.it/7begkd). 

The status bar is crucial to the Android notification system. On the left side of the status bar are icons for all the pending notifications. These icons stay here until the notification is manually opened or dismissed.

## The notification drawer

https://i.imgur.com/jgCBymo.png

Usually notifications are listed in the drawer in reverse chronological order with the most recent notifications at the top. However, and this is important, this order can be affected by the following things:

* The app's stated notification priority or importance
* Whether the notification recently alerted the user with a sound or vibration
* Any people attached to the notification and whether they are starred contacts
* Whether the notification represents an important ongoing activity, such as a phone call in progress or music playing

In the above image we can see one example of how Android handles notifications differently than iOS. At the very bottom is an unimportant notification regarding the current weather; despite the recentness of this information, it will always appear condensed and at the bottom because it's been set as relatively unimportant.

## Multiple notifications

Here is the most often talked about advantage of Android notifications. There are two different ways Android apps can handle multiple notifications from the same app:

### Summarizing

https://i.imgur.com/pkCzrPU.png

One notification that summarizes them all. A messaging app might have a summary notification that says ""3 new messages.” Upon expansion, it could show a *snippet* for each message.

### Grouping

https://i.imgur.com/fzKlpT8.png

Here is the piece de resistance. Basically all the similar notifications are grouped under one parent. The parent gives the top level information like what app it is and when the most recent of the children arrived.

## Actionable buttons

https://i.imgur.com/G9zoiB5.png

Above is an example of an ongoing notification, where the information is live and the user can either pause or increase said timer. These actions are hidden until expanded, as seen with [this calendar notification](https://i.imgur.com/OtDQH3i.png).

## Inline reply

https://i.imgur.com/OAFMQPV.mp4

Both iOS and Android offer in-notification replying. However, Android keeps the notification the same size instead of popping up to fill the screen.

A feature I really like is the persistence of a notification once I've replied inline. For the Android Messages app, for example, I expand the notification and see a history of the last 5 messages sent (provided you haven't opened the app and have only been using inline reply)

## Full content preview

https://i.imgur.com/S7vxMuT.png

Some notifications can be expanded to allow the user to reveal the full content of the notification.

## Ongoing processes 

https://i.imgur.com/w63bQPG.png

These types of notifications give the user an update on background processes. A lot of focus in the latest Android updates has gone into providing information through notifications about battery draining problems that have historically plagued Android (I'm not a fan, but they can be informative).

## Notification channels

https://i.imgur.com/ksNXPBh.png

In the latest Android updates, Google has introduced notification categories that allow the user to specify which types of notification they'd like to receive. Supported apps let you turn off certain notification or otherwise change how they arrive separately from other types of notifications from that same app. 

When upgrading their apps to Android 8, developers are required to define channels for each type of notification they want to send. They are also required to set an individual importance for each notification:

* High = Makes a sound and appears on screen
* Default = Makes a sound
* Low = No sound
* Minimum = No sound or visual interruption (LED, peak, ambient display)

## On the lock screen

### Ambient display

https://i.imgur.com/XH7ZlzY.png

On the latest version of Android, the ambient display makes use of the prevelance of AMOLED screens to show notifications without waking up the full display. The majority of the pixels stay off and the notification is presented alone and with larger text.

Users can also double tap the display to get a overview of notifications represented by the status bar icons.

I love being able to swipe away notifications on this ambient display without the whole screen waking up.

### Active display

Notifications can appear like they would in the notification shade: https://i.imgur.com/ryORNyI.png

Or, they can appear in a condensed form if the user doesn't want the content visible: https://i.imgur.com/DYLQLy7.png (fixed)

## Snoozing

https://i.imgur.com/D31tKor.jpg

This is new. Any and all notifications can be snoozed by the OS for 15, 30, 60, for 120 minutes. When that time is up they appear just like they did the first time, using the channel preferences.

## Media controls

https://i.imgur.com/efs9qc3.png

This one is less important with iOS's control center, but I love it so much its worth mentioning. Media on Android is controlled through notifications. Whether it's what's playing on your Chromecast, Google Home speaker, or bluetooth earbuds (all at the same time even) each can be controlled using the notification.

## Colored notifications

https://i.imgur.com/p7ifFcP.jpg

New to Android 8.0 are colored notifications. Calls, timers, navigation, and media can all take different colors to help distinguish controls, information, and messages. You can see how the media notifications colors are derived from the album art, which I find really cool. [Here is an album](https://imgur.com/a/FZPNS) of some examples of how this looks with different album art.

Another cool thing this image shows is the full-sized messages. When a message is longer than one sentence, the notification will adjust it's size in the notification shade to let you read the whole thing without manually expanding it.",476,2919.0,2017-11-10,AAPL,0.059876780956983566,0.9088139832019806,0.031309209764003754

iphone,The iPhone X has changed my life.,"I know, I know. That’s a pretty bold statement but hear me out.

I live in Buffalo. An all-American city built on a once booming industry and prosperity. We are well known for many things; Snow, tailgating, beef on weck, and our beautiful Niagara Falls. However, most importantly, we are known for our chicken wings.

Chicken wings, folks. I’m not talking about that baked and breaded bullshit you get down south with a dry rub and a side of ranch. I’m talking deep fried, thrown in a bowl of Franks hot sauce and butter and tossed around so much you’d think Jim Kelly himself were the one making them. Pair that with giant serving of bleu cheese and some carrots and you’ve got yourself the best damn chicken wings ever. The way your deity of choice intended them to be. You can only find them here. Only in Buffalo.

You’re probably wondering where I’m going with this, so let me tell you. I eat a lot of chicken wings. I love them. They love me. How the hell was I supposed to use Touch ID when I’ve got wing sauce all over my god damn fingers. I can’t.

apple,How are we suppose to use iPad Pro as a computer replacement if iCloud Drive on Files App can't even load any of my photo/video thumbnails for preview?,"This is most annoying thing ever, I feel like being able to load thumbnails is such a basic feature that all file explorers should have.

Only photos that are kilobytes in size will load automatically, for anything else I need to tap on the photo to load; super annoying if I'm trying to find a specific photo or video.

This goes across as an issue on all of apple's platforms as well; thumbnails won't load on MacOS, Web Browser, and Files app unless you manually download them.

I've already sent Apple feedback, but I feel like my input isn't enough; I'm surprised no one else is complaining about this.

apple,One thing I love about the iPhone X is the lack of the landscape homescreen,"The Plus models have always bugged me when going home from a landscape app; the homescreen changes to landscape (or it's already there) because you're still holding the phone in the landscape orientation. Then you'd rotate the phone back to portrait, and sometimes the homescreen didn't turn back to portrait for a second or two, which is annoying.

I've never wanted to use the homescreen in landscape mode, and so the fact that the iPhone X doesn't have it is nice.

Edit: some people have pointed out that you can disable the landscape homescreen by turning on Display Zoom (General &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Display Zoom).

apple,Non-Optimized Apps List of Shame,"Here’s a list of major apps that still aren’t updated to run with the iPhone X’s screen. These apps are high profile enough that it’s downright embarrassing.

The current list of shame as of November 17th 2017.  Shame!  

The biggest offenders are Google and Amazon, which should really get their act together since they're in competition with similar apps.  Most of the others are understandable since they have limited resources.  But they still belong on the list.

iphone,“IT’S NOT AN iPHONE “TEN”!,"Was shopping in WalMart today and I stopped by the electronics counter to ask about the Black Friday gift card deal. I kindly asked the lady behind the counter if she expects there to be any iPhone “tens” in stock for Black Friday and she says “no, we’ve received no shipments and have never received any in the store, so I don’t imagine we will have any for Black Friday”. 

Then plain as day I see the iPhone X box in all its glory, locked in the cage behind her but laying separate from the other iPhones. I point behind her and say “well you’ve got an iPhone “ten” right there!”  She slides the cage door over and says “this is not an iPhone ten” then angrily shoves the box to be hidden out of site. I reply, “it certainly is” and she slams the cage door shut and says, “no it’s an iPhone X!”

apple,In response to all of these “Beat FaceID!” Videos,"I’ve seen a couple videos now of people claiming to beat FaceID so I thought I would post a quote from the Apple white pages and a link to the white pages themselves.

Apple FaceID white pages: https://images.apple.com/business/docs/FaceID_Security_Guide.pdf

-

“To improve unlock performance and keep pace with the natural changes of  your face and look, **Face ID augments its stored mathematical representation over time.** Upon successful unlock, Face ID may use the newly calculated mathematical representation—if its quality is sufficient—for a finite number  of additional unlocks before that data is discarded. 

Conversely, **if Face ID fails to recognize you, but the match quality is higher than a certain threshold and you immediately follow the failure by entering your passcode, Face ID takes another capture and augments its enrolled Face ID data with the newly calculated mathematical representation.** This new Face ID data is discarded after a finite number of unlocks and if you stop matching against it. 

These augmentation processes allow Face ID to keep up with dramatic changes in your facial hair or makeup use, while minimizing false acceptance.”

-

In the three videos I have seen, they have never shown one of them enrolling in FaceID, and then someone else getting in immediately after. In fact, in one of them I think they explicitly said it took multiple PIN unlocks before it worked.

The [mom and son](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dUMH6DVYskc) video, the [older brothers](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7anj9f/iphonex_face_id_fail/) video, and the [younger brothers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XNIMlzchDv0) **are not faked**. They just trained FaceID to accept their face.

Now how to prevent this from happening? **Do not give away your PIN.** And if you DO give someone access to your phone, don’t be upset when it turns out they have access to your phone.",61,448.0,2017-11-19,AAPL,0.06697278469800949,0.9099946022033691,0.02303256466984749

apple,A Very Important iOS Hidden Feature: Customizing Auto Brightness,"Perhaps many of you know about this hidden feature of iOS, but I had no idea about this even actively following Apple-related websites and forums on daily bases. It’s not even documented in Apple’s official support page, nor any results come up when I Google searched.

I never used Auto Brightness feature in iOS as it became too dim during night time or too bright in daylight. Yesterday I was thinking why Apple doesn’t include an option to customize the latter feature by setting the lowest and highest levels of brightness and then thought what will happen if I manually adjust the slider and... lo and behold. It actually works!

Just turn on the Auto Brightness, then take the phone in a pitch dark room. Open the Control Center and you’ll see how the brightness slides all the way down. Now you can adjust and set it to your desired lowest level. Take the phone under the Sun or a bright light bulb and the level will go all the way up where you can set it to your desired maximum brightness.

That’s it! From now on the Auto Brightness will dim and brighten the display between your set levels instead of too dark or too bright.

apple,How is no one talking about the Phone app behavior in iOS 11?,"I know I'm not the only person who is taking a lot of phone calls during the day but I'm not seeing anyone talk about this, so here it goes:

**You can no longer lock the phone during a call in iOS 11**

If you take a call then press the sleep button and then wake the phone by tapping (iPhone X), home button, or sleep/wake button it will immediately bring up the phone controls. This means you can't take a call, put on headphones, and confidently store the phone in your pocket without worrying that you will accidentally hang up, mute the phone, or do something else to the call.

What's even **worse** is that every time the phone receives a notification during the call, it will automatically wake the screen and bring up the phone controls, making it even more likely that one will accidentally change the call.

This behavior is the same on a factory reset iPhone on iOS 11 so I know this isn't a bug I'm experiencing. 

I understand that it's more convenient to get to the controls now since you don't need to unlock the phone but I just don't see how Apple can ignore the use cases of the phone while on headphones.

apple,iOS 11 made me go from loving my phone to hating it,"I bought an iPhone 7 Plus 256 gig around this time last year and I loved it immediately. This was my first iPhone being an android fanboy for a long time. 

However since iOS 11 it has been nothing but frustrating. When it first came out my battery life was absolutely ass, granted they have fixed that and it’s not so bad anymore. 

My Bluetooth earbuds are still constantly beeping if I get a message in messenger, iMessage, and sometimes just randomly while it’s annoying I can deal with it it’s not really that bad. 

However recently my phone has just been hard crashing. If I’m using it sometimes the screen will just go black and have a spinning circle loading and eventually I’m back at my home screen with every app closed. It has even started doing this when it’s in my pocket. My music will suddenly stop and I’ll take out my phone and hit the home button and nothing will happen same with the power button. I actually have to hold my power and volume down button and the phone will finally reset after about 10 seconds. 

This is incredibly frustrating because I initially loved the phone and how fast it was, and the amazing battery life. Now it’s just nothing but frustration.

apple,Safari screen seen when double tap on iPhone 7 always shows last porn site I visited.,"Well sorta as said above.  Why is it that if I watch porn on my phone through safari, then for a week or what have you, when I double tap home button to quick change apps, the “frozen” (cached?) safari app always shows that old (since deleted) porn screen?!?  I mean it could be a week later, history deleted five times, 100 other non-porn sites visited in meantime, and the one that shows up when I double tap is that one of the two naked lesbians.  This means I always have to close safari just in case the wife happens to get in my phone, etc.  This issue is honestly happening and not just once but almost every time: the cached safari page is a porn page.  Help?!?

apple,"Apple should implement double tap to wake, unlock and go straight to homescreen","On the iPhone X. Right now, you can tap to wake  and then swipe up to go to home screen. Apple should allow a double tap to wake and go straight to home screen, without the need to swipe up.

So, 

* Single Tap to wake and unlock
* Double Tap to wake, unlock and go to home screen

This way, you can **single tap** to wake your device to check notifications/time and respond to notifications directly from lock screen, or **double tap** to wake your device and go directly to the home screen, anytime you want.

I know people want a toggle in Settings to change the behaviour when you wake the device, but it could get frustrating when you want to check the lock screen and the device goes straight to the home screen and now you have to swipe down to check notifications or open the apps individually. The above approach will allow you to select the behaviour on demand (single tap or double tap), and would be less frustrating.",109,803.0,2017-11-24,AAPL,0.03088976815342903,0.939570963382721,0.0295393206179142

apple,Solution to Net Neutrality: Tech giants should set up VPN services.,"The net neutrality battle can still be won, and it's surprisingly easy how:

Apple, Microsoft and Google set up a VPN service and integrate it with the OS so all traffic goes over that VPN.  It is default-on, and the end user has to put work in to turn it off. 

They then set up peering arrangements with a few tier 1 providers that include a ""no selective throttling"" clause.

Why every tech giant? Simple.  That way, the ISP can't say ""OK, Apple, if that's your attitude we'll throttle all your users, giving them all a shitty experience and they'll think you suck"".",275,1104.0,2017-11-25,AAPL,0.031047126278281212,0.890771746635437,0.07818112522363663

apple,Heads up: Apple Watch data is significantly more expensive than carriers will tell you,Just a heads up:  Got my first AT&amp;T bill with my Apple Watch LTE added on.  Taxes on the $10 data plan add-on come to $7.69 meaning the cellular plan for the watch is actually $17.69/month or $212.28 for a year of service.  That's insane and totally not worth it.  Just wanted to make people aware of the fact that AT&amp;T conveniently neglects to mention how expensive the plan will actually be.,254,478.0,2017-11-29,AAPL,0.017940642312169075,0.9107183218002319,0.07134108245372772
AppleWatch,Today's Apple Watch accomplishment means so much,"At the age of 40 my kidneys failed after a lifetime battling diabetes. I was on dialysis for eight long years, nearly dying several times. I was in extremely poor health when I miraculously received a kidney and a pancreas transplant four years ago.  The first year after my transplant I struggled to walk an entire block without sitting down to rest. Now at the four year mark I just closed my rings four days in a row (with the award showing up in all its glory on my watch), going on a strenuous hour long walk around the hilly terrain where I live.  This unexpected award is tangible proof my endurance and stamina continue to improve and that life is getting better.  It might seem a small thing, but getting this achievement today meant the entire world to me.",28,476.0,2017-11-29,AAPL,0.026689166203141212,0.8778970241546631,0.09541378915309906

apple,I thought Apple Music was fine until I had to show my mom how to use it.,"I've never been a huge fan of the iOS 10+ Apple Music interface, but it's worked well enough for me that I've gotten used to it and don't have many problems with it. When my mom signed up for Apple Music yesterday and asked me to show her how to create playlists and add songs to her library, I thought it would be easy enough. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Here's a sample of things she said to me throughout the process:

""What's 3D Touch?""

""Oh, you mean I have to actually push on the screen? How hard do I have to push?""

""Sometimes when I 3D Touch a song it starts playing.""

""I didn't mean to add it to my library.""

""So when I delete something from my library, it deletes it from a playlist too?""

""Why do they make it so hard?""

Obviously, most of us here will not have had this experience, and if we did, we would've learned the correct behaviors in seconds through curiosity and trial and error. But for someone close to 70 and not up on all the latest Apple technology but still wants to enjoy their products, the learning curve seems a little too steep.

From my own perspective, the app seems well designed in some ways (library organization), but poorly designed in others (hidden menus/options). There's just a lot of room for improvement. I hope in iOS 12, Apple Music is improved so that it's easy and fun to use for everyone—from experts to casual users and everyone in between.",185,606.0,2017-11-30,AAPL,0.05604173615574837,0.9088160991668701,0.03514217212796211
