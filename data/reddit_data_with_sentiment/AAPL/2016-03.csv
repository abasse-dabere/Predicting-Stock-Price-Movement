Apple have made changes to supervised devices to include a message on the lockscreen, and also changed the message shows in Settings &gt; General &gt; About.

**Edit:** Testing on another iPhone to see if the message appears when connected to MDM or supervised. Will report back shortly.

**Edit 2:** Hi 9to5Mac! 

**Edit 3:** I've seen a few people asking for the wallpaper source. I got it from this great dump: http://imgur.com/gallery/YGHnC

&gt; Everyone running 2.90 on OS X should immediately upgrade to 2.91 or delete their copy of 2.90, as they may have downloaded a malware-infected file.

Using “Activity Monitor” preinstalled in OS X, check whether any process named “kernel_service” is running. If so, double check the process, choose the “Open Files and Ports” and check whether there is a file name like “/Users//Library/kernel_service”. If so, the process is KeRanger’s main process. We suggest terminating it with “Quit -&gt; Force Quit”.

iphone,Melted cheese. Cursed be thy name.,"After eating breakfast this morning, I pick up my iPhone to read some news, as is my morning custom.  But the fingerprint sensor will not accept my print.  So I type in my purposefully long and cumbersome password.  I finish my morning rituals, then drive to work.  Before I walk into the office I remember an email a coworker had sent to me.  The iPhone still will not accept my fingerprint.  I put the iPhone down and focus on something else.  a while later I pick up the phone to call my wife with the same result.  I enter my password for the 5th time today.  This is getting tiresome.  I find a cloth and spray some Windex on the cloth, then gently rub the fingerprint sensor.  It's not that dirty to begin with.  Same result.  I google ""How to replace fingerprint sensor on iPhone 6 plus""  I am mentally prepared to dismantle the device to try to fix this problem.

Then I see it.

A small orangish/yellow stain on the edge of my finger.  I lift the offending digit to within sniffing distance of my olfactory senses.  Cheddar.  Sharp Cheddar.  I remember how hot it was when I ate my egg and cheese sandwich a few hours ago.  A civilized man would get up, go to the nearest sink and wash his hands.  But I am in no mood for gentility.  I lick the embedded fingerprint cheese from my finger. I then dry off my finger by wiping it on my pants like a filthy gigantic man-toddler and test the iPhone.
success.

Are there any functional advantages to having a Mac? Do they work longer (years) than typical laptops? Does the battery life stay long after a year or more of daily (all day) use? Or do they just have great displays and appealing design?

What I need in a computer:
1. Something functional and reasonably fast
2. Working USB and headphone ports
3. A keyboard that can take a beating (use for work)
4. A reasonably sized machine--where I can read the screen with ease, and transport it with something smaller than a backpack
5. Something that won't die within a year b/c of daily use

I'm not fussed about having a pretty machine. I just need it to work reliably and consistently. Is it worth it to get a Mac?

After warming it up inside of my house I could start it again and it was at 18% battery life. 20 seconds later it died again cause of ""low battery level"". I plugged the lightning cable in and was able to use it normally a couple of minutes later.


I've had my 6S since a couple of weeks after the release last year and I've experienced this multiple times even when it's not even below freezing point.

apple,TIL The same programmer has been making Klondike solitaire for Mac for 32 years.,"There were several articles noting the 25th anniversary of Windows 3.0 Solitaire last year, and even as a lifelong Mac guy I got a little nostalgic. Windows Solitaire has a Mac connection, in that the card graphics — and other icons in Windows 3.0 — were designed by ex-Apple artist Susan Kare.

But today I was reminded that point-and-click solitaire, like much else on Windows, was on the Mac years earlier. Klondike was released for the original Macintosh 128K in 1984. The original developer, [Michael Casteel](http://www.casteel.org), has kept Klondike up-to-date for every Apple OS ever since — 32 years and counting!

You can find several articles online that are supposed to be about the history of computer solitaire that don't mention this, or even name some other title as the first GUI solitaire game. At the risk of looking like I'm posting an ad (I'm not) I think Casteel deserves more recognition. There are and would be many other Solitaire games  without this one, but how many have 32 years of version history?

It's just as well Apple never bought it and bundled it. Given their historic ambivalence about games it probably would have been buried during a re-org at some point.",26,606,2016-03-20,AAPL,0.042500805109739304,0.9199292659759521,0.03756990656256676

History appears to be repeating itself. Apple is refreshing an iPhone model, that while slightly outdated, has a devoted fan base. 
People clung to the iPod classic, because it offered the most music storage per dollar, and because they felt they just wanted something that could store and play music easily. The iPhone 5/s/SE design offers the full iPhone experience in a device that fits easily in the palm and pocket.

apple,Can we take a moment to appreciate just how good Apple's emoji designs are?,"Apple's emojis are really fantastic, they are well designed and have become iconic in the WhatsApp/iMessage era - when people think of emojis, the Apple designs are seen as default (what emoji are you YT videos, emoji cakes, Katy Perry Roar lyric video all using Apple emojis).

Most other emoji designs are really quite poor by comparison.

For example, consider one of the most used emojis, the grinning face: 😀

[Apple Emoji grinning face](http://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/19/0c/190cf73e8ae41c318e51fa7fe774f047.png)
Simple design, nicely detailed, kind of 'cute' (due to lack of a better word...)

[Google Emoji grinning face](http://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/a3/22/a32265bb1e91b1f642f53fc4f4edb5cc.png) Flat design went way too far, what is going on with the teeth? Looks a bit creepy

[Microsoft Emoji grinning face](http://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/2d/27/2d27b5e8382fee57e97ea8d791b77ca3.png)
What were they thinking!? This is just scary

[Samsung Emoji grinning face](http://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/47/d4/47d4b96b68bcea708240443bdb0d0240.png) Looks tacky, too much detail/skeumorphism for small text

I realise this is hardly groundbreaking innovation, but it just goes to show the level of work put in the small details - Apple realised how important texting was and designed beautiful emojis that work very well and are nice to look at.

Google obviously put in effort too, but latched on too much to the flat design fad and their emojis are simply less pleasant and end up looking a bit creepy in some cases. Microsoft also has this issue, but even worse, with everything being completely flat and looking a bit creepy.

Samsung are on the other end of the spectrum, their designs look really low effort to be honest and have far too much detail - it just doesn't seem well thought out.

This is obviously subjective and this is my own opinion of it, but given how [people seem to love the Apple emojis](https://www.google.co.uk/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=PnX2VvzUH6fS8Ae0xrSwAQ&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=emoji&amp;tbm=vid) (despite Samsung and Google having strong market share), it seems that I'm not the only one - what do you think?",314,564,2016-03-26,AAPL,0.03518765792250633,0.8965224623680115,0.06828993558883667

AppleWatch,Left my phone at home but ended up having a cool experience,"Last weekend my SO and I head up north for a quick getaway. On Saturday night we decide to hit a few tap houses with friends and then dinner. When we arrive at the first place I realize I left my phone at our accommodations. I'm a little bummed but no biggie. Then my wrist buzzes! It's a text from the friends we're meeting up with.

It turns out that we went to this same tap house last summer (before I had an Apple Watch) and I connected to their wifi. I learned that night:

apple,Really early comment on 9.7 iPad Pro protruding camera,"I just now received my 9.7"" iPad Pro. When I pre-ordered it I read that several people were complaining about the slightly protruding camera which may make iPad wobble on a flat surface, thereby ruining the drawing experience. I became worried but then realized that if the camera bump is not really high, it won't make much difference given the size of the device. And anyway I would put a case on the ipad, which will flatten out the bump.

So about an hour ago with some apprehension I put my brand new ipad on the wooden desk and to my relief found literally no wobble. I used Notability with Pencil for around 15 minutes and experienced no issues whatsoever because of the bump. And it's been an amazing experience writing with the Pencil. Currently I use a Wacom tablet but this is so much better.

So in case you are holding off iPad Pro purchase only because of the concern about the camera bump, I say don't worry.
