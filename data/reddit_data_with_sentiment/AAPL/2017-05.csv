apple,PSA: Don't put your 2016 Macbook Pro on magnetic surfaces,"I've just discovered this problem by accident when I put my macbook on top of my iPad pro with smart cover. It seems that only 2016 macbook pros are affected.

If you position macbook's fans right above any strong magnetic surface, the fans will get unbalanced, resulting in loud and annoying noise.

I tried it with 3 different macbooks and could reproduce the issue every single time.

See video of the issue below. The video is not mine, I just randomly found it on youtube when trying to find other people with the same problem.

&gt; terms of competition falling out and so forth, it's ‚Äì the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering
&gt; point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so it's not ‚Äì I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that ‚Äì it's already a big business

apple,The Chinese iPhones let you choose which apps can connect to the internet,"So I got hold of an iPhone 6s from China, model A1700. It came preloaded with iOS 10.2.1. I have updated it to 10.3.1.

One interesting thing I found within iOS is the ability to restrict internet connectivity for specific apps. This is something you can't find on iPhones outside China. You can choose to allow WiFi, WiFi and Mobile Data or nothing. One thing to point out though, it's not called WiFi, it's called WLAN, but it's still WiFi. There's also an option for WAPI, which I guess is some Chinese protocol.

When launching an app that uses internet for the first time, you will be asked if you want to allow internet for that specific app.

[Here are some pics](http://imgur.com/a/Hx85G) showing this. If you have any questions regarding what can be found on Chinese iPhones feel free to ask.

apple,"Thank you for 8 years, Apple","Growing up with computers, I always opted for a PC. Cheaper, customizable like Legos, and fun to build. I'd built several machines before my birthday in 2009, when my sister decided to splurge on me and buy a Macbook Pro.   

Sleek and slim, I found that it worked great, I made videos with it, edited them, published to Youtube, I wrote and recorded (terrible, terrible) songs with it, and published THOSE to Youtube. (terrible, terrible idea)   

Years have gone by, stickers have been added, Gopro videos edited, games installed, played, uninstalled, hard drive wiped, RAM upgraded, lid dented,  

I bought a 250gb SSD and yet another RAM upgrade, to 8gb. My late 2008 sexy unibody still runs like a champ, and I play mild games, browse reddit, edit videos and listen to a ton of music on it. Today, after purchasing the $200 upgrade, I realized my upkeep costs are pitiful, at aproxx $300 dollars over the last 8 years. That's all I've spent on this thing.   

So thank you, Apple, for creating a product that can truly last. I've gotten more than my sisters money's worth from this machine, and I'll keep abusing it until I can splurge on myself and buy a new one.",177,798,2017-05-07,AAPL,0.041647184640169144,0.9145026803016663,0.04385015368461609

apple,My wishlist for macOS 10.13,"I wish Apple would introduce features that push the Mac platform forward in addition to porting iOS features to the Mac. (Cross posted to [Medium](https://medium.com/@iosight/my-wishlist-for-macos-10-13-63ea74c1dad7), [MacRumors](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-13-wishlist.2001073/#post-24557522) and [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/answer/166242647) [Column](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/26768549))

Experience

- Media and Playback controls. As /u/PrsnSingh and /u/FoferJ mentioned, a less distracting volume/brightness control HUD such as [cleanHUD](https://github.com/w0lfschild/cleanHUD).

- Window Management. Split Screen from El Capitan is not good enough. Windows 10-style window snapping can be very helpful. (Some of the best selling apps from the Mac App Store does exactly this!)

- Pro theme. Provide a more comprehensive pro theme than Graphite or Dark Menu Bar + Dock. Provide a more muted color scheme across the system that is not as in-your-face as ""Increase Contrast"". Should apply to Aqua widgets for views and for windows, title bars, glyph icons and app icons.


Frameworks

- Make UXKit public. While macOS has great support for pro apps and content creation apps, important native mainstream consumer apps (such as Messenger, Reddit, Medium, Instagram, etc.) will never arrive without an easy way to port an iOS counterpart to macOS. I don't mean the current patchwork UXKit for Photos or Pricing, but the ability (including tooling in Xcode) to easily port iOS apps to the Mac without significant engineering effort. Most companies don't have the budget/team for creating desktop apps. If their mobile effort happens to translate to a native desktop app by ticking a checkbox and making some minor UI adjustment, a lot of nice things can happen. The UX would actually be quite good if Apple makes it easy to map TabBar as segmented controls in the title bar (the back button is fine on top-left corner), and performs some magic on mapping UIGestureRecongnizers to NSGestureRecognizer even if those two internally work wildly apart. For a more visual example using the News app as an example, see: https://i.imgur.com/1FcvwQo.jpg

- Allow emulating iOS apps on the App Store with no recompilation or resubmissions required (Unlikely). The ability to emulate iOS apps on the Mac with a dynamic binary translator similar to Rosetta. Again, scrolling and zooming gestures are mapped to Trackpad gestures. Tab bar is mapped to the unified title bar.

- Update GPU acceleration frameworks (Extremely Unlikely). Update OpenGL to 4.5. Add support for Vulkan. Keep improving Metal.

- Update outdated UNIX tools (Extremely Unlikely). Update bash, git and other GPL-licenced UNIX command line tools to the latest version, ~~let go the GPL3 grudge~~ sort out legal issues with the GPL3 license.

- Improve thermal management. Some poor balance is made between fan speed and device thermal, especially for MacBook Pro 2016 devices. If necessary, be more aggressive about when the fan kicks in. As /u/Sixty4Slices mentioned, this may come in an SMC update rather than a full OS update.

- WebKit. Fix performance issues of rendering and scrolling for WKWebKit instances so that scrolling and page loading in embedded WKWebView is as smooth as it is in Safari.

Existing Apps

- Siri. Allow third party developers to support Siri with SiriKit and IntentKit. Add support for HomeKit devices. Add support for actual timers, not reminders. No, ""I don't want to set a reminder instead"". If that means porting the Clock app to macOS (I bet it will look beautiful full screen in the World Clock view), I'm all in for it.

- Notification Center. Redesigned Notification Center (or just bring the one from El Capitan back). Allow apps and websites to receive push notifications and display them in Notification Center even when the app is not currently open using APNs.

- Spotlight. Improved Spotlight responsiveness and a more streamlined interface. The one from Mavericks can be used as an inspiration. It is way faster at searching local files and shows a lot more results at once without scrolling. Also, lazily load results from the internet, such as weather, stocks or sport scores and never let the loading of thee contents impact the performance of local searches.

- Mac App Store (Extremely Unlikely). Drop unrealistic sandboxing restrictions, especially ones related to networking permissions or granting file system access. Reduce the 30% cut to &lt;10%, so the big players such as Adobe Creative Cloud and Microsoft Office can join the Mac App Store, finally marking the death of crappy counterfeits or ""Guides"". Seriously, even if they don't improve their sandboxing policy, crappy counterfeits with copyright-infringing icons or names should still be purged from the store. They are very confusing to many, many less savvy customers.

- Safari. The ability to add Safari web apps to Launchpad, then run them as if they are actual apps. Each app has its own icon on the Dock and in the app switcher. Drop/loosen the window size limit for PIP videos. Drop the requirement of $99 Developer Membership to publish Safari Extensions. Improve the Content Blocker API to be more flexible.

- Finder. Improved scrolling responsiveness (Scrolling in Finder has always been a hit-and-miss, where it is buttery smooth in 10.6, 10.9 and 10.11, but regressed severely in 10.7 and 10.10. Whatever the cause is, please locate it and fix it). Improved performance when accessing SMB and network storage. Improved file management and handling, perhaps by redesigning the sidebar on the left to include additional disclosure triangles for Devices and Favorites, so that moving files to another favourited subfolder becomes easier.

- iCloud Drive. A more sensible amount of free storage, with iWork documents being excluded from storage size calculations unless the user is embedding large media files (similar to Google Drive) and photos being backed up for free in reduced quality (similar to Google Photos).

- Photos. Fix hogging issues associated with the photoanalysisd daemon. When one device has analyzed a photo, sync the analyzation results to other devices via iCloud instead of having each device perform its own analysis. Also sync facial clustering information while you're at it. If necessary, offload the task of analyzing photos to remote iCloud servers instead of handling them locally. Additionally, improve the facial clustering algorithm.

- Preview. While powerful and handling both PDFs, images and other file formats, Preview can benefit from a facelift. Perhaps even add support for opening and editing .SVG files ~~and ""Back/Forward for files in the same folder""~~ This already exists through File -&gt; Open and picking a folder in the file picker. Thanks, /u/nupogodi.

- QuickTime and AVFoundation. Add support for HEVC / H.265 as well as the .mkv media container.

- Xcode. Improve Swift tooling. Compile time is way too slow for larger projects and auto complete sometimes silently fails. Add refactoring for Swift.

- iOS Simulator. Fix UI performance issues. UIKit in iOS Simulator has became ridiculous choppy after 2013 even on top end hardware.



New Apps:

- Apple News. This one should be a straightforward port from iOS if we get UXKit. See https://i.imgur.com/1FcvwQo.jpg

- iTunes. Break it apart into separate apps. The branding is confusing, the features is convoluted and the global search bar is often buggy, automatically jumping from searching in one store such as iTunes U to another such as Podcasts.

- Podcasts. This one should be a straightforward port from iOS if we get UXKit. Would be nice if we get features similar to Overcast‚Äôs Smart Speed and Voice Boost.

- Voice Memos. This one should be a straightforward port from iOS if we get UXKit. Seriously, I see people on my college campus opening QuickTime Player (and sometimes even GarageBand!) in lectures to record audio notes. The need to record and organize audio notes would be much better addressed with a dedicated app.

- TV. This one should be a straightforward port from iOS if we get UXKit.

- Animate. Create cinematic 3D animation with the ease-of-use of iLife or Apple Pro Apps. Rendering engine written on top of Metal. (There has been no new Apple pro apps/creative apps launching on the Mac for a very long time. Even Clips is iOS only. 3D animation feels like an area that can really benefit from Apple-calibre UI and UX design and superior performance enabled by its SW+HW integration and lack of legacy baggage)",144,315,2017-05-07,AAPL,0.03631900312999884,0.8830911914507548,0.08058980976541837

apple,Changed from Android to IOS. Facing some Issues. Please help.,"I recently bought an iphone7. Till now, I had been using only android. The following are some issues being faced by me.

1) The whatsapp media is not begin shown in the photos app of ios. I have enabled the option of saving the media to camera roll in whatsapp, still no luck

2) Does ios only allow 10 images to be sent via whatsapp at a time. WTF?

3) Google photos is not able to back up some images. It says ""Too big or unknown type.

Does anyone know how to resolve these issues?

&amp;nbsp;

Edit:

1) Reinstalling the whatsapp fixed the first problem I think.

2) If I use the picker from whatsapp, then I am able to send more than 10 images. However if I select photos using the photos app of ios, then the option to send via whatsapp disappears on selecting more than 10 photos

iphone,My Android Experience Made Me Appreciate iOS/iPhone Even More,"Late last year my iPhone 6+ was showing signs of wear and tear. My wife and I had recently purchased a house and I wasn't prepared to spend a lot of cash on a new phone. When Verizon offered me a Google Pixel for $10 a month, I jumped on it. With trade in, I got the Pixel for next to nothing. Having said all that, on Monday I happily switched back over to an iPhone. 

Don't get me wrong, the Pixel is a pretty slick phone. Stock Android is pretty slick, the promise of Apple like software updates for at least two years and the price were enough to convince me to try it out. It was essentially the iPhone of Android phones. If that makes any sense.

There are a few really important factors in my decision. I thought I'd share them.

1. Support - I had one issue with my Pixel and Verizon essentially told me to take it up with Google unless I wanted to go through insurance. Google support sent me a list of things to try that amounted to ""restart your phone"" and ""uninstall and reinstall your apps"" until it doesn't happen anymore. Folks, I know it gets said all the time on here, but you really can't understate the benefit of having an Apple store to get physical support at.

2. Ecosystem - All the credit in the world to Apple here. They've made an ecosystem that is difficult to walk away from. Something as simple as responding to a text message on my MacBook wasn't possible without a lot of work around and apps. The ecosystem was something I never truly appreciated until I was out of it. Throw in things like continuity and Apple Pay through websites, it's an ecosystem that I wanted to be back.

3. iMessage - No, this isn't a blue bubble thing. In 6+ months of owning the Pixel, I never did manage to get text messages squared away. There were two or three group texts that, no matter how many times we restarted them, I never got all of the messages. It's a non-factor now that I'm not the only one without an iPhone.

4. Workflow - I realized that the iPhone fits my workflow so much better than the Pixel did. From work to personal, the iPhone just meets my needs better. I can't help but feel like the iPhone is much better designed to handle Exchange and enterprise wide usage.

5. Customization - I thought I wanted it. I thought I was bored from looking at the same grid of icons for so many years. I was wrong. I didn't customize at all. I don't have time play around with Android and really maximize all the potential it has.

6. It just works - People joke that Apple doesn't really ""just work"" anymore. There just enough instances with the Pixel where something didn't work as I expected it to, or took too many attempts to make it work for me. For instance, I could never get Google Maps on the Pixel to play as Blue Tooth call over my radio like it does on iOS. I travel all the time for work and my options were streaming radio/Spotify or not having turn by turn directions spoken. Google Maps gets it right on iOS.

So...this has already become long winded. I just thought I'd share my thoughts. Congrats to Google for putting together a really cool phone in the Pixel. I'm happy to be back in iOS land, and hope the I'll be welcomed home to r/iPhone.",70,189,2017-05-10,AAPL,0.050786279141902924,0.9146736860275269,0.034539952874183655

apple,iPhone SE impressions from someone who has only ever used Android,"Previously I used a Droid X &gt; Droid Incredible 2 &gt; Moto X &gt; Nexus 5X &gt; Pixel (returned) &gt; Nexus 5X. I haven't used an iOS device since helping my parents with their iPad 2s years ago. They no longer use them.

First, I want to get out of the way that I will be keeping the iPhone SE and using it going forward. This is almost entirely driven by hardware and OS update concerns. The iPhone SE is the only great small smartphone today. Android does not have a single answer to it. It is the right size for me, it is well built with a good camera, screen, processor, and provides a snappy experience. It has absolutely phenomenal battery life, it seems like I would get 10 hours of screen on time if I drained it to zero in a day. The apps all seem optimized for the screen size and work well. When you combine that with the fact that I bought it from Cricket for $200, which is practically giving it away in my opinion, there was basically no way I would not buy and use this phone.

However, I have to say that when it comes to iOS 10, I am not as thrilled. Like I said, the apps are well optimized and work well. But that's different than the OS. Notifications are worse, much worse. I do not understand why they disappear and are hidden, instead of putting little icons in the status bar. It makes them far less useful. So far I cannot depend on them. I have set my To Do and messaging apps to not disappear, and that has helped somewhat as the chance of me missing them is much lower. But still, I cannot use notifications on iOS like I use them on Android, where I set things I need to do to show up at certain times and then they stay there until I do them. On iOS, you risk missing important things if you quickly unlock and use your phone for an urgent task, and don't sit and look at each notification. This just doesn't happen on Android. You are forced to deal with each one before it disappears, there is no ""still there but forced to automatically hide"" nonsense. I'm not sure people that only use iPhones can understand what they are missing based on my description, but it makes a big difference.

Setting alert tones is another pain point. On Android I can set different sounds for every app, and different sounds for different contacts in different apps. It looks like for Hangouts on iOS I am stuck with the Hangouts sound for everyone, and in Facebook Messenger I am stuck with the Facebook sound for everyone. This may seem small, but it's just way less convenient. In a similar vein, why is the alarm volume and the alert volume the same? I want my alerts to be one volume and my alarm in the morning to be a much more pleasant quieter volume. This is easy on Android.

Next is how music and navigation are handled. On Android, when you are playing music you can easily thumbs up songs from the notification shade. On iOS, you are stuck with the limited controls in Control Center, which means I have to open the app more. Why? For navigation, how is there no persistent UI method of returning to navigation? On Android, there is a notification that you can easily click at any time, on iOS you have to multitask or go track down the app on the homescreen. I have been in the bizarre situation where I am navigating and listening to music, and Apple thinks presenting full screen music controls on the lockscreen is more useful than seeing the next turn in Google Maps. Blows my mind.

I thought sharing between apps would be more of a problem, but so far it's tolerable. I have to share, then go find what I've shared in the app I shared to, which is weird, but at least it does work.

Anyway, those are my main complaints. If they copied Android's notification system I think this phone would be a lot better. But I do plan on keeping it, and maybe I'll adapt more as time goes on. But mostly I think Apple should just copy how notifications work on Android.

--------------------------------

UPDATE:
Unfortunately I ultimately decided to return the phone. I feel very frustrated to do this because everything about the hardware is so perfect for me, but I do feel like I gave it a fair shot. I had been assuming and acting like I was going to keep the phone up until last night, and I finally reached the straw that broke the camels back, where my gut is now very much against keeping the iPhone SE.

In the end it's the notifications that put me over. I stopped using Todoist for task management and switched to Apple Reminders. As I noted in a reply somewhere below, I did this because Apple Reminder notifications stuck to the lock screen and could be depended on to stay there until acted upon. Except, that turned out not to be true. Last night I was texting someone and a reminder came in. I turned off the screen, then turned it on again expecting to still see the reminder. It was not there. The reminder was in notification center though. If I can't depend on any app on the iPhone to put and keep something important on the lock screen, then it's just game over.

After thinking about it more, I've decided that this has to do with how I am wired. While other people have Gmail accounts with thousands of emails in their inbox, every day I go through and archive or turn my emails into tasks to reach ""Inbox Zero"" (though I hate the branding, people understand what that means). When I leave my Gmail inbox there is nothing in it. Similarly, at work I have configured Microsoft Outlook to work the same way. I created an ""Archive"" button that marks the email as read and moves it to an ""Archive"" folder. I use my inbox as my to do list, clearing everything I am finished with and at the end of the day there are no emails left. Anything that crosses days is moved to an Important folder, which usually has a handful of things I can't deal with right now but will need to be reminded of some morning soon. If I need to find anything, I just use search.

Android works the same way by default, except instead of just for email, I use it to organize my entire life. Notifications come in from different apps, and I clear them until I reach Inbox Zero. If I can't act on them or don't want to snooze or reschedule them, they need to stay on the lock screen. I was trying very hard not to make this a requirement but it just is. 

The notification system on iOS is illogical. Your ""inbox"" doesn't exist anywhere, there is a subset of notifications on the lock screen, a subset in Notification Center, and a subset that are red badges on each home screen. None of these places needs to agree on what your current notifications are. I tried to make it work, but ultimately I need one good ""inbox"" like on Android instead of multiple sucky ones. It doesn't help that Apple Reminders is not well designed, at least for me. Todoist runs circles around it. I also encountered general bugginess with it that gave me an impression it couldn't be depended on.

Anyway, I just thought I'd add this update for anyone that comes across this and was curious. I want a phone this size with its amazing battery life. But it just doesn't meet my needs.",114,119,2017-05-12,AAPL,0.044288281351327896,0.9196518659591675,0.03605984337627888
apple,Apple really impressed me this week.,"Last week I took my mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro in for the ""service battery"" message. Going in, I knew this would cost about $200 and I would be out of a machine for a week or so. I wasn't too concerned and really just wanted the work done. Over the past 5 years, this machine has had the display replaced as well as the logic board. Neither have bothered me much since I was under Apple Care. 

During the Genius appointment, they let me know that the battery &amp; top case was a ""constrained supply part"" and wouldn't be available until September. They offered to replace the battery for free if I waited. I mentioned how I use my machine for freelance work and how short the battery times have gotten. 

Surprisingly, the Genius said: ""hold on, we might have one more option"". He left for 5 minutes and came back offering to replace my current MacBook Pro with a refurbished model but, at the cost of the repair. He said that it would be the same specs as mine but refurbished. Everything was kind of cryptic. He wouldn't tell me which year the machine would be. I just assumed a later 2015 model or possibly early 2016 model. 

A week later, I'm opening a 15"" Touch Bar MacBook Pro! I'm really impressed at how far they went to keep me working. I even have the standard 1-year warranty with the option to purchase Apple Care again. Crazy to think I could not buy anther machine for at least a few years.

apple,"Be careful, some developers are rather clever.","I will be the first to say that I don't mind purchasing apps and supporting developers, but when they try to get you to buy in an rather clever and tricky way becomes my issue. 

I received an email alert from AppShopper of an update for the app [Grab For Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grab-for-instagram/id546639267?mt=8) so I went on to see what the update was about and decided to install the app and check it out. 

Upon opening the app, there's a brief splash screen and the **very next** thing is for you to scan Touch ID to purchase the IAP to remove ads. The problem with this is that it can be inadvertently processed and the purchase would have already been made. *I almost triggered it thinking I had Touch ID enabled to open the app but that couldn't have been the case because I had just installed the app.* At least allow me to log into the app, check the app out and then decide if I want to remove ads. But to make it so that you can accidentally make the purchase before even exploring the app is the wrong way of doing in my opinion. 

Edit... now that I am able to see the reviews, where earlier today I wasn't able to, this has been going on since March based off one of the reviews.

apple,Search party of Apple Devices - Classic Apple,"The other day I had an experience with my AirPods which reminded me why I love apple's products above all others. I had a long day of classes and exams. The day started at 8am and culminated with an exam from 5-8pm. 


At the end of the exam I went to put in my AirPods to listen to some music on my walk home. When I pulled the case from my pocket it was empty. I quickly realized I hadn't used the AirPods since before my 8am class. I also had gone to about 7 buildings on campus throughout the day. So I had no idea where I had lost them.


I pulled out the find my iPhone app and clicked my AirPods. It showed that the last time they were connected to my phone was in a random building around 11am. (I assume they were loose in my pockets until then and just eventually went to sleep). So they had been disconnected for 9 hours and I had no idea where they had gone. 


I clicked play sound for the AirPods. Obviously since they weren't connected they couldn't play a sound immediately. I got a notification saying something along the lines of ""your AirPods are not connected, you will receive a notification when a sound is played."" 


So basically I was like ""well fuck, they are gone, its been 9 hours what are the odds that I find them"" So I put the phone away and continue walking. 


About 3 minutes later on a random street on my walk my Apple Watch taps me and says ""your AirPods have been found."" I was confused, I thought, what are they in my bag or something? So I pull out my phone and open the app again. It shows my AirPods safe and sound at home, connected to my Mac mini that I frankly never use. 


So how did my Mac mini that I've never connected to my AirPods find them? When I clicked play a sound and it couldn't, find my iPhone notified all of my devices (iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook, Mac mini) that I was looking for them. They all began trying to connect to the AirPods. The Mac mini found them and then let me know where they were.


They were in my coat pocket at home, where I had stopped off for lunch around noon.

apple,The Plus sized iPhones need much more landscape support in iOS than what's currently in place.,"90% of the time, my 6S Plus is at my desk plugged into the charger sideways, leaning against something. 

In order to read a notification or do something on the lock screen, I have to pick the phone up and turn it upright. It really doesn't make a lot of sense that the lock screen doesn't support landscape orientation. The Plus is large enough to warrant this considering how often it spends its life horizontally.

What bugs me even more (and this is not really as much Apple's fault as much as developers' fault) is a lot of apps also don't support landscape whatsoever, and some definitely used to 5+ years ago but removed it (Facebook comes to mind). The iPad versions of these apps almost always support landscape, so what's so hard about coding it for Plus sized iPhones?

I am a huge Apple fan. I have been for a very long time. I have had many Macs, iPods, iPhones, iPads etc over the years. But I did not run out and get the Apple Watch at launch. 

I won a Series 0 AWS back in the fall of 2015 through work for a Sales Achievement contest. They sent me a 42mm black Watch with a black band. I exchanged it for a SS model and wore that for a few days before I exchanged it for a Gold AWS with midnight blue sport band.

I work for a very large, well known technology company as a senior sales engineer. I sat on my ass for many years and let the pounds pile on. Every year for New Years I would try to make a resolution to lose some weight. It never worked. I wore the Apple Watch a bit from the end of October through December of 2015. I decided to get serious and lose some weight, change my lifestyle and exercise. Maybe the motivation of the rings on the Watch could help me?

On January 4th of 2016 I weighed 355 pounds. On the Watch my move goal was 350. I started exercising by walking around my block. At first 2 times around which made about 1 mile. Then 4 times, then 6 times around.

I knew I was crazy when I went for a walk and it was 5 below zero. I started to lose weight and kept filling the rings.

One day in February 2016 it was raining so I decided I should join a gym just to keep walking. I joined a Planet Fitness and for the next 3 months all I did EVERY day was walk on the treadmill and do the Elliptical for 90 minutes a day to 2 hours a day.

By the time May rolled around I had lost 65 pounds. At this time I decided I need to go to a real gym, get a personal trainer and lift weights along with the cardio. I kept filling the rings. My move goal was anywhere from 750 to 1000.

Fast forward to today and 2 more Apple Watches, a AWN+ and a SB with the link bracelet and I have lost almost 150 pounds. For reference I am male, 6 feet 2 inches tall and I now weigh 210 pounds.

I go to the gym and exercise every day and I keep filling the rings. Yesterday I hit my 500 day move goal. My activity setting is down to 750. I plan to continue to fill the rings through the end of May. Then I will lower my move goal to 500 and finally take a day off. Since January 4th of 2016 I only missed meeting the Activity goal once and I missed it by 27 calories. I was really pissed.

If you got this far... thank you for reading. I hope that this motivates at least one person to eat healthy, change their lifestyle, exercise and lose some weight.

TL;DR - I lost almost 150 pounds over the past 16 months. I have Apple and the Apple Watch to thank for motivating me.

I was fine with just getting the battery fixed and honestly pretty surprised it was only $199. 4 days later I get this email and now it looks like I won't need a laptop upgrade for another 4 years haha.

These sorts of actions are what made me fall in love with Apple. They're the biggest company in the world, and yet they're still so consumer focused and make consistently quality products.

* Seems to be more durable (finally).
* Faster charging.
* Non-proprietary, which leads to more 3rd parties cables and the use of external batteries.
* Cable and adapter are separate, which leads to lower replacement expenses.

Cons:

* Magsafe was nicer and safer (but people for who tripping over the cable isn't a problem, argue that being able to charge on both side is worth the trade-off).
* No L-Shape. 
* Few cases where the plug is tight or loose.
* Macbook 12'' may be more susceptible to cable tripping accidents due to low weigh (consider that table surface matters in all cases).

apple,Macbook users: does your iMessage sometimes take forever to sync?,"I'll leave my macbook alone for a few days, come back and try to use it only to have my macbook just update my imessages very slowly like one message at a time. I'll also get notifications for every single updated message INCLUDING messages I sent.

Why can't it just be synced all the time? I have power nap enabled and even then, I think it should all be synced instantaneous like checking email. Is there something I'm doing wrong or is Apple just kinda lacking in this area?

Edit: From what I have concluded based on our Reddit knowledge, Apple does not allow iMessage to be synced over power nap. It's on their end. To solve this problem, u/GreggyP00 says he schedules his Mac Mini to wake at a certain time at night and then to sleep. 

To do this, go into system preferences, ""Energy Saver"", go to the bottom right corner to the ""schedule"" button and you can schedule when your MacBook wakes and sleeps while on battery power or on a charger. 

I am going to see if this will sync overnight and get back to yall if you want. I am concerned if my MacBook wakes up to the lock screen and timesout after 10 seconds. I will see in the morning.

iphone,How do you like your AirPods?,"I wandered into the closest thing resembling an Apple Store in my city while my girlfriend went to another store to shop for clothes. I asked if they had them and for how much, and he told me he had only one pair which was rare. So I jumped on them on a whim. 

I've been somewhat interested in them since they were announced, since I use my EarPods all day for work and the wires can be a bit of a pain. That being said, they came to just under $250CAD after taxes and while I can afford it, that seems pretty damn steep. I'm on the fence about whether I should take them back or just open them and enjoy them. 

So for those of you who have them, how are you liking them? Any regrets? What kind of range do they have? Would you be able to leave your phone in your car and still be able to listen a few feet away?",129,150,2017-05-21,AAPL,0.02726840414106846,0.9006805419921875,0.07205105572938919

apple,"I went to a drawing session for the new ""Today at Apple""","Quick rundown: I signed up in the morning on a whim and popped down to a nearby Apple store to maybe get a little bit better at drawing on my iPad.

The class was just two people: myself and another gentleman. There was one Apple employee who was quite a good artist who ran the class. The name ""class"" probably isn't really appropriate, it was more of just a ""instructional hangout session"". We talked and we went through some of the features of the app Procreate. We brought our own iPads, by chance we all had the app purchased and installed already, I'm not sure what the deal would have been if that weren't the case.

The Apple store employee did a rundown of basic digital drawing stuff like layers, selection tools, color palettes, etc. I learned a few features of Procreate I didn't know about, so overall I left the class more knowledgable.

That said it was a little _too_ unstructured for my tastes, I wish there was more of set example things to draw to explicitly practice each feature we went through.

iphone,I found IPhone 7 in India and looking for an owner,"Hi everyone
Few days ago I accidentally met an indian guy in Kolkata trying to unblock IPhone 7. He typed a ""western"" email and tried to guess a password. A guy asked me to help because I was walking next to him, so I saw an email and thought I could return it to an owner, so I've bought this IPhone. The email was incorrect and it seems like it was a trick to sell it to me, but anyway I didn't pay that much and still want to return it. Does anybody have any idea how I can find an owner? iTunes asks that email n*****@gmail. IMEI 35 377808 583483 0

apple,"The new Apple ""App Development with Swift"" book is great...","Just wanted to pass this along to anyone who's wanted to get into Swift development... you may or may not have seen that Apple released a new full length book on the iBooks Store (for free) titled ""App Development with Swift"". 

They previously had an ""Intro"" version on there for the past several months I believe but this new one is supposed to be a full-length course for high school / community college curriculums. I'm doing it on my own (not as part of a class).

I started it when it came out last week and it's really great. It covers everything in an easy to understand fashion (I happen to have some basic C/C++ knowledge which has made it a tad easier), and it makes use of Xcode Playgrounds with guided assignments to get you familiar with the syntax.

It goes lesson by lesson through each part of the language as well as SDK features to get you using what you just learned to make actual apps, which start out extremely basic and progress further.

It explains everything you need to know to complete the Playgrounds and mini SDK apps, and then it does a project at the end of each chapter which is a larger app that brings everything in that chapter together.

I just completed the Apple Pie app in the 2nd unit and it's really helping...I'm really enjoying it and want to keep going.

Has anyone else tried this or started it at all?
