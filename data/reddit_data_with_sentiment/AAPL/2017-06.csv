apple,Tim Cook's letter to employees regarding Trump's withdrawal from Paris accords,"""Team,

I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough. 

Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that’s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well. 

We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we’re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet’s future. 

Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us. 

Your work is as important today as it has ever been. Thank you for your commitment to making a difference every single day.

apple,"What if Apple are planning to do something revolutionary with the OLED display in iPhone 8, something no other manufacturer has done before (taking full advantage of the individually powered pixels)?","I just have this feeling that they might try and overhaul the iPhone experience now that they're willing to adopt OLED. Apple has a history of adopting certain technologies late in the game but when they do, they always make the most of them. If they're adopting OLED now, it's because they feel that they can make the most of the technology.

Apple and in particular, Jony Ive, have always had the vision of a 'phone' being a slab of glass where you're not sure where the hardware ends and the software begins. We've seen this demonstrated over the years with the various iterations of iPhone and with the latest iPhone 8 leaks, it looks like Apple are getting ever closer to this vision. 

Another value of theirs is that technology shouldn't be there unless it is serving a purpose. 

Now, take OLED, most manufacturers make little use of the ability to individually power pixels. Some have always on displays which offer some useful glanceable information whilst preserving battery life but that's really as far as we've come. What if Apple decides to do something very bold with the OLED iPhone by literally having all pixels turned off unless they're displaying information or content. What if they're designing iPhone 8 so that it is just a slab of glass with as many pixels as possible turned off at any given time, therefore truly taking advantage of OLED. 

I could really see Apple doing something like this. Not just a 'dark mode' but designing the entire OS from the ground up to take advantage of OLED:

Large portions of the screen could be disabled entirely when not in use, for example when somebody tries to call you, this could be displayed in the form of a notification in the centre of the screen with the bottom and top of the phone completely turned off as it's not needed. 

The stock keyboard could just display the individual keys floating with the background black/disabled. It would just look like the 'screen' of the phone is only in the top half or so and the keyboard is almost a physical keyboard sitting on top of the glass. 

Stock apps could take advantage of the ability to disable pixels to only display the content that is required.

The messages app, for example, could just show the conversation bubbles as thought they're floating across the screen on an otherwise completely black sheet of glass. 

In short, only content would need to be displayed and nothing more. The line between software and hardware would be further blurred. 

The concept of having a 'screen' would almost fall away entirely and content would just be displayed on the 'phone'. The fact that the display size would be 5.5 inches (or whatever it will be) and the aspect ratio would be 18.5:9 (or whatever) - this would be less relevant. Sometimes, the screen may only need to be 4 inches or the aspect ratio might need to be 16:9 (for a video) etc. Again, the idea of having a 'screen' would change and content would just appear how it needs to appear on the 'phone' without conforming to any given shape or size. 

This is a bit wild and wacky I know but if anyone is willing to take such a bold step in this direction it would be Apple IMO.",187,112,2017-06-03,AAPL,0.043801117688417435,0.9218426942825317,0.03435616195201874

apple,TIL how to AirDrop the original (240 fps) slow-mo video on iOS-to-iOS you need to edit and remove all the slow parts,"I was trying to get the original recording in full fps from my brother's iPhone over AirDrop and it was only sending over the edited version, without the original 240fps recording. After much search I finally found how to do it:

In the Photos app edit the vide to remove the slow down area ([move the knobs together](http://i.imgur.com/n0F8KgH.jpg)), save it, and AirDrop it. You'll notice that you won't see a intermediate ""Processing..."" step and the receiver iPhone will be able to adjust the slow area as if it had recorded the video on device.

It took me a while of searching on Google to piece this together, this is why I think this post doesn't break rule 7.

apple,Just found an old stock of iPhone 4S.,"My god, when i opened this from the box, it smells 2010 like i opened my iPhone 4 for the first time. This design is really timeless. It ages well after 7 years. It's really beautiful and compact and it feels like holding a gold bar. It feels so right. 

Battery is depleted so i didn't know which OS is this. Hoping it's iOS 7. 

Bought this for $100 lol.

edit: it's iOS 7.1.2

what features i really missed:

2. small letter displayed on keyboard when typing small letters.
3. ad blocker (if iOS 7 has this, safari probably wouldn't this slow).
4. swipe down to close an image in camera roll/gallery.",138,321,2017-06-04,AAPL,0.02645544894039631,0.9095215201377869,0.0640229806303978
apple,"If Foxconn leak is legit- ""Apple Iris"" smartglasses were a Google Glass competitor","The Foxconn leak today specified Apple's in-development smartglasses as using a Kopin NED (near eye display) of 428x240 resolution delivered via an optical prism. Take a look on Kopin's website and you'll find that exact product. 

[Product page (product at bottom)](http://www.kopin.com/capabilities/optics/default.aspx)

[Image of 428x240 Kopin NED with attached prism optics](http://i.imgur.com/CETZ6Pm.png)

So this seems to be the display component that Apple has been using for these supposed smartglasses. The real takeaway here is that this component generates a **14.5° field of view**. This is a very small FoV that would essentially amount to a rectangular transparent display viewable near the upper corner(s) of your eye. This also happens to be nearly the same FoV and optical approach that Google took with Google Glass. The ""Apple Iris"" glasses described using these components aren't the full vision encompassing transparent displays that I think many of us imagined for AR glasses, but instead a small information screen that resides out of your normal view which is really not much different than what Google Glass was. 

What do you think? Is/was Apple developing a rehash of the Google Glass concept? Was there anything wrong with Glass in the first place, other than being far ahead of social norms? Should Apple wait until we have display tech that can match the Hololens experience, but in a much smaller form factor?",60,282,2017-06-04,AAPL,0.03621210902929306,0.930171549320221,0.03361635282635689

apple,"Here's why new Apple products are usually ""too expensive"" at launch, followed by a price drop after a year or so.","I am by no means an expert at this, but I saw a lot of conversation regarding the price of the HomePod and iMac Pro and wanted to shed a little light on it. Feel free to jump in and correct me where I mess up.

I'm specifically referring to NEW product launches (i.e. HomePod), or *significant* feature updates to existing products (i.e. Retina display), not updated iterations (i.e. thinner, lighter) of existing products, as will make sense later. Usually, a new product is introduced at a fairly high price, and the price is normalized in subsequent years, either by the price coming down, or more and more big features being added while keeping the price the same.

A common complaint about Apple products is that you pay the ""Apple Tax"" to get something shiny with a fruit decal on it. As most /r/Apple-ers would agree, you're getting a lot for that money. In fact, many of us would argue that the Apple Tax doesn't really exist when you add up the cost of the individual high-end components of a device. I wouldn't disagree.

In the product development and marketing world, there are two main pricing strategies: 1) Cost plus and 2) value based. [Cost plus pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-plus_pricing) is when you add up the individual components of device and then add a mark-up for overhead like R&amp;D, marketing, administrative expenses, and of course, profit. [Value based pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-based_pricing) is based on a consumer's perceived value of the product, and has little to do with the actual costs. This is why people will pay $4 for water at an amusement park, something they can get for free elsewhere - because it's providing them value by being convenient, cold, etc. It has nothing to do with the actual cost of the water.

Both of these strategies are trumped by [willingness to pay.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingness_to_pay) Essentially, an individual has a dollar threshold that they are willing to pay for a given thing. They won't buy it for more than $x, but they will buy it for anything less than $x. It's kind of common sense - you can't charge more for a product that people are willing to pay for it.

Let's use the HomePod as our example. The problem is - some people might be willing to pay a lot more for it than others. Joe, who is heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem and loves playing music in their home, might be willing to drop $500 for it. He has a high willingness to pay. Bob thinks it's cool, but doesn't really see the need for it might pay $200. He has a low willingness to pay. How can you sell it to both of these people?

Well, you could price it at $200, and you'd get both Joe and Bob to buy it, giving you $400 of revenue. But why do that? You could price it at $500, get just Joe to buy it, and have $500 in revenue. What if you could get both people to buy it? What if you could get Joe to pay $500 *and* get Bob to pay $200? Revenue of $700 would certainly be better. This is called [price discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination), and it's the ultimate goal for basically anyone selling stuff to a diverse group of people. 

Airlines are kings at this. How do you get each person to pay as much as they are willing to pay for it? In buying a plane ticket, airlines can tell whether you're traveling for business or pleasure based on a variety of factors - mainly, how far in advance you book. Business travelers book mid-week trips last minute, and they don't care how much it costs because the company is paying. Leisure travelers plan for weekend trips months in advance, and price is a huge factor in if and when they go. So airlines price their tickets to be cheaper to further in advance you purchase, enabling them to sell to business and leisure travelers close to their willingness to pay price points.

It's much harder to do price discrimination with consumer products. You can't charge different people different prices in a store. For Apple - how can they differentiate their Joe's from their Bob's? 

Combine this problem with the [Bass model.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model) This shows that with any innovation, like a new Apple product category, there is a group of ""innovators"" (Joe, aka Apple fanatics) who are going to buy it early. The ""imitators"" (Bob, aka the masses) are going to wait until the product is proven and has become more popular. Bob was *never* going to buy it Day 1. Joe was *always* going to buy it Day 1. 

So Apple prices its new product launches to Joe's willingness to pay because he is going to buy it regardless, and Bob is not going to regardless. In the future, as the product becomes more popular, either the price will come down, or Bob's willingness to pay will increase (or both) so that Bob is now a customer. 

This pricing structure allows Apple to make the most money while still getting the product into as many hands as possible.",59,285,2017-06-08,AAPL,0.03586457297205925,0.9290905594825745,0.0350448377430439

iphone,Apple is misleading customers on their website about the iPhone Upgrade Program with advertising the is outright false. They are now refusing to help me with a decent solution.,"https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program

&gt;Works with your carrier.

&gt;You’re buying directly from Apple. Which means no more financing your iPhone through your carrier or committing to a multiyear service contract. Your new iPhone will work with your carrier, so you won’t have to make any changes to your rate plan. And if you ever decide to switch carriers after you activate your iPhone with AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon, you can easily do that, too.

This was one of the main reasons why I signed up for the program. Despite my username, I do switch carriers quite often.

But, no, no you cannot do this easily whatsoever.

The fine print for this paragraph states:

&gt;AT&amp;T and T-Mobile customers may need to visit an Apple Store to switch carriers. See a Specialist for details.

I am trying to switch from T-mobile to Verizon. Two days ago I spent HOURS on the phone with AppleCare as they were trying to troubleshoot my phone to get the Verizon sim card to work. And yes, I know that the Verizon and Sprint versions of the 7/7+ have different hardware as the AT&amp;T/T-mobile versions.

Finally a ""senior support advisor"" told me to go into an Apple Store and get a replacement. Nothing would need to be changed on the contract, this would just be a simple warranty replacement.

I get to the store and after dealing with numerous people at the genius bar and the manager, they come to the conclusion that the only way I can get a phone up and running on Verizon is if I cancel my current iPhone Upgrade Program contract and sign a new one. This is not a viable solution whatsoever for many reasons, here are the top 4:

1. They said I would apparently get a refund for the $369 I have already paid in monthly charges for this phone, but they wouldn't give an estimate of when I would actually get the funds back.

2. I would then have to pay the over $100 for taxes and the first month payment upfront.

3. I would have to do another credit check.

4. I would no longer be eligible to receive the next iPhone upon release in September since I am on a new contract that would start today, meaning I couldn't get the next phone until I have made 12 months worth of payments.

I then call back into Applecare and spend another 3+ hours on the phone being transferred around to every single department with everyone saying there is no other way of doing this, even though it no where says anywhere on the website or in the actual contract's terms, that switching carriers means cancelling your current iPhone Upgrade contract and signing a new one, completely nullifying the whole point of the program to me which is to get a new iPhone every year on release date.

Why can't I just swap my current phone out for a Verizon version? Why can't we just mend the current contract to reflect this and sign off on the changes?

I now am in contact with a ""Senior Customer Relations Agent"" who failed to return my call after she transferred me to a sales agent to go over options (someone who was seriously the least qualified person that could be thrown into the situation, he couldn't even understand what I was trying to do).

What can I do here? I am now with Verizon, my phone is currently just a paperweight. Their website says I can switch carriers EASILY but that is not the case.

Doing another credit check. Paying $100 upfront. Losing the ability to get the new iPhones every year on release. Having $369 just go into limbo with no estimates on when I would get it back.
No, that's not ""EASILY"".

What are my options here? I have wasted 3 days on the phone and going into the store (which is nearly an hour away with traffic). Don't they have to hold up their end of our contract? Why can they just do whatever they want here? The are blatantly advertising this as a great feature of the program.

EDIT: And of course, now I notice the typo in the title...

EDIT 2: To all the naysayers who are ridiculously saying I am in the wrong, I just spoke with someone who is the highest escalation point at Apple's customer relations and she told me after researching, she sees the disconnect and where I am getting all this information and sees that there is a major problem because Apple has that same disconnect internally. She is going to escalate the problem further until it is resolved and make sure that the website clearly states what can and can't be done, because right now it shows I should be able to do what I am trying to do but their internal documents don't allow for it. She said there is no way for the customer to know this. So its a very big issue that needs to get resolved right now.",161,312,2017-06-09,AAPL,0.055976223200559616,0.9078084230422974,0.03621537983417511

apple,I’ve found the perfect settings for AirPod controls,"Previously, I’ve had my AirPods set to Play/Pause with a double tap, for the sheer convenience of being able to put them in, tap, and hear music straight away without having to touch my phone. It’s easy enough to press the volume buttons on my phone through my pocket, but what I’ve always wanted is a way to skip to the next song.

So naturally I was really happy to find out that not only had that been added in iOS 11, but you could set separate controls for each AirPod. So I set the left AirPod to Play/Pause, and the right to Next Song.

But then I set the left to Previous Song out of curiosity and was blown away to find that when no music is playing (and thus you don’t need Next/Previous controls) double tapping either AirPod will start playing music! This means I can now have all the controls I need right from my AirPods, with left set to Previous, and right to Next. If I need to pause I just take out an AirPod. If I need Siri, I just raise my wrist and speak (bonus: it won’t stop my music). This is literally perfect.

Also, the volume limit in Settings never used to apply to AirPods for some reason, but now it finally does!

The only complaints I now have with the product are the tap controls relying on vibration – it’s annoying when the song changes when I fix my hair; Siri’s voice being really shitty quality through them for no obvious reason and the delay which means I can’t use them for music recording (a limitation of technology; not Apple’s fault). But these are so minor that the AirPods are near on perfect. Such an amazing product.",108,418,2017-06-10,AAPL,0.045456063002347946,0.9271878600120544,0.02735603228211403

apple,"Let's take a moment to appreciate Apple, and WWDC","I was fortunate enough to [win a scholarship to WWDC 2017.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/66qwo4/wwdc_scholarship_replies_have_been_sent_to/). I want to share my experience, hopefully inspire some, and shed some light inside how dub dub works.

Sunday started with what's known as the ""scholarship orientation."" We got our badges, pins and Levis jacket, and headed to the San Jose hammer theatre. We had talks from Apple Engineers about topics like the Apple Pencil. Tim Cook then came and took a photo with us all. Towards the end of it, we all went out into a room where there were apple engineers floating around, and we could question them. As we left, we were given free Apple TV 4's.

Monday was the keynote. Scholars didn't have to queue, as we had front row seats reserved. The keynote was awesome, so was the stuff after it. 

The rest of the week followed with sessions and labs. Labs are interactive sessions with engineers, where you could get problems fixed, and ask questions. Sessions are more keynote style, where people present on the newest technologies.

The rest of the week was like this, until Thursday, which in the evening was the ""bash"". This was essentially a party. We had great food, games, and then at around 7PM, Craig himself appeared. He announces that the Fall Out Boys are playing, and that they'll play loud enough to drown out the sound of the planes from the nearby airport. Oh boy, that was true. It was amazing how Apple united everyone. All the scholars, employees and attendees were so happy. Everyone was having fun, which was amazing. 

The effort, and level of detail was amazing. From how badging into the convention centre worked, from the lunchtime talks they picked, and the Michelle Obama talk. Even how there was little pins of the stickers in the dub dub app, that you could physically collect. That was a really great touch.

I was so surprised at how Apple turned a developer conference into a really social, and fun event. I was genuinely saddened when I had to leave earlier, but the friendships, experiences and skills learnt are invaluable. Thank you to everyone for making it what it was, and **thank you apple.** You've given us all an invaluable experience that I will never forget. It's amazing how much detail you paid to everything.

apple,Siri saved my life,"TLDR, got really sick, couldn't make it to my phone. Used Siri to call 911 on my iPad, which was right by my side. Paramedics came and hauled me off to the hospital. Thank God for Siri!

—————

Sunday night, I got really sick at 2am because of accidentally taking too much of my prescription drugs. I was lying in bed with my iPad next to me (playing Star Trek tng!) but my phone was across the room.
I woke up and had lost control of my legs, to the point where I couldn't walk. This feeling spread up my body, to the point where I lost the majority of control over my arms. Then my speech started to slur, and I was afraid my throat would close up.

I wanted to call 911, but there was no way I could make it over to my phone to so so. But my iPad was in reach, and while there was no way I had the dexterity to manipulate what was on the screen, I was able to mash down the button and say 'SIRI CALL 911'.

It took a few tries. One time, the phone rang, but it dropped when they answered. Calling back, it maybe took one or two tries to get Siri to understand. But on the third try the call went through and I was able to talk with the 911 people through the iPad.

It was only a couple minutes for the fire truck to get there. Really fast, they had me in the ambulance, and then to the emergency room. At the ER, they put some IV fluids in me to flush out the other stuff, and they kept an eye on me so things wouldn't go bad. The next morning, I was feeling much better and had checked out by 11am.

It was really a scary and crazy night. There was no way I could have reached my iPhone. I'm convinced that Siri saved my life. It enabled me to call 911, when I had no other way to do so.

So my lesson from this, next time I'm shaking my fist at Siri for mistranslations my commands, I will cut it a bit of slack because it helped me so much when I needed it.

Thank you Apple and the Siri team!
 
 
—————

Edit: a lot of people are calling out the fact that it took a couple tries, and Siri should have worked the first time. I think this wasn't all Siri's fault. First time, call went through and the phone rang, but the call got disconnected when they picked up, I don't know why. Second time I tried, but 911 was calling me back and my cell phone was ringing. For whatever reason this wasn't transferred to my iPad, probably because I was trying to talk to Siri at the time. After that, on my first or second try the call went through and I spoke to then through my iPad. 

So, took multiple tries partly because of Siri, partly because of Handoff, partly because the call dropped after it started ringing, partly because of crossed wires with an incoming call, and partly because of me slurring and fumbling.

apple,The new iPad is absurd,"I bought the first iPad on release day in 2010, mostly because i thought it seemed cool, but I didn't really *need* it. Against my expectations it very quickly became my most used and beloved device, much to my surprise. As a result I ended up using it every day for hours at a time, largely because the form factor of having a touchscreen-enabled computer in the form-factor of a book turned out to be incredibly convenient and pleasurable. 

A few years later and my work paid for a top-of-the-line iPad, which turned out to be a 64GB iPad 3. Don't laugh though; this thing turned out to be an amazing machine that has fulfilled its purpose for five years with aplomb. Though I know it has the reputation of being the 'pretty crappy' iPad, this thing still did what I needed it to for all these years and the battery life is still good, lasting all day of constant use.  

So enters the new iPad Pro 10.5"", which I have been waiting for for a number of years. This thing is ridiculous. It's almost embarrassing. It's essentially the perfect distillation of what Steve Jobs and Apple have been visualising for however many years; a computer you hold in your hand and interact with without barriers. 

As I'm used to the speed, power and performance of the older device, every single thing about this machine is blowing my mind. The time it takes to open apps; the scrolling; the sound; the thinness and weight; Touch ID!; the form factor; the sheer quality of the screen.... 

Due to the 120Hz refresh rate and the larger display, it really does feel like I'm holding my apps and the internet in my hand and genuinely touching it with my fingers. It's difficult to describe, but it is a qualitatively different experience than using technology through a WIMPS paradigm on a traditional laptop/desktop. It's more intimate, immediate and rewarding and this iteration of the hardware only perfects the goals that Steve and Apple were trying to achieve with the iPad concept.  

To me, this is the perfect iPad, the perfect tablet and the perfect distillation of what technology can do in this space in this form factor. With iOS 11 we really have the next generation of mobile computing in our hands and Apple should be proud of what they've achieved.  

I know this post is long and seemingly sycophantic, but technology really can inspire when it gets it right, and the iPad Pro really, *really* gets it right. I actually feel like we've entered a new era of mobile and home computing with this device and I think that should be celebrated.",629,1955,2017-06-15,AAPL,0.03634988144040108,0.9252154231071472,0.03843473270535469

iphone,"[DEV] If you enjoy strategy games, we're making a location-based strategy game for iPhone called Terra Mango! You can build a tower for your species on any plot of land that has a building on it in the real-world.","Hey guys!    

We are a small startup company of 7 employees based in Orlando, Florida. We are big fans of base building games, MMOs, and RTS games and were inspired by Pokémon Go. What we wanted to create is a strategy game based in the real-world where you have to go out and look for resources, build towers, defend your resources, and take over territory for your species. It blends together real-world exploration, MMOs, and RTS games into a mobile game. You can build a tower for your species on any plot of land that has a building on it in the real-world. You can turn your house, neighborhood, or city into your base, you accrue resources, build armies, and take down enemy bases.    

There are 3 species that are fighting for territory and resources, Human, IO, and Aurayu: [https://terramango.com/images/characters.jpg](https://terramango.com/images/characters.jpg)    

There is more to the game than what I've explained, but this gives you the basic idea of the gameplay.    

We'd like to invite r/iPhone to join our closed beta, so if you're interested, sign up at [https://terramango.com](https://terramango.com) Sign up as well if you just want to get updates and sneak peeks.

apple,"Monochrome for Reddit, a new reddit app for iPhone","Hi everyone, a few weeks ago, my app [Monochrome for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monochrome-for-reddit/id1128991367?ls=1&amp;mt=8) launched on the App Store. It took about two years to build (LOTS of rewrites), and I had a blast making it. I'd like to share with you some of the cool features I’ve built. If one of the features I describe doesn’t quite make sense, or if you’re just more of a visual person, check out [this 3m video that shows Monochrome in action](https://vimeo.com/222034286).

Disclaimer: Some of the features I’m going to mention will be exclusive to Monochrome Pro, a $2.00 In-App Purchase. Monochrome Pro is the app’s only form of monetization. There are no advertisements.

* Stellar scrolling performance. Over the course of development, I’ve spent hours inside of the Time Profiler fine tuning performance. I think you will absolutely notice a difference in smoothness when using Monochrome. Every time I open another reddit app the number one thing I miss from Monochrome is the silky smooth scrolling.

* Dark mode and auto dark mode. Auto dark mode works by grabbing your location and calculating sunrise/sunset times. (Pro)

* Ever gotten lost as to who is replying to who? 3D Touch a comment to see its parent comment. (Pro)

* Monochrome has an intelligent system for analyzing URLs and determining what it should do next. The system only displays an SFSafariViewController as its last resort. If it has reason to believe the link is to a GIF, it will attempt to convert to MP4 and show that to you directly. Likewise if it believes it’s a link to an image, it will present the image directly to you with a native fullscreen image viewer. This extends to YouTube links, gfycat links, Imgur album links, and more. This system is employed everywhere throughout the app, meaning you get the benefits described here both when tapping a link in a comment and when viewing a post. Instead of going to a webpage to view content, this system skips the webpage and displays the content directly. Never see a banner again!

* Since GIFs almost always play as MP4’s, you will always see the version of the GIF with the highest resolution and FPS. If someone posts a 720p 60FPS GIF, you will a 720p 60FPS MP4. Unfortunately the official reddit app plays actual .GIF, so a lot of the time GIFs played by their app will look like slideshows and will play at much lower resolutions (see r/RocketLeague). Not to mention, playing .GIF is a lot more resource intensive because of the larger file sizes and significantly less optimized playback.

* When scrolling through posts, a GIF will only play once it is fully onscreen, similar to Facebook and Instagram. This is great because GIFs won’t start before you’re actually watching them.

* GIFs display a progress indicator in the upper left corner, letting you know how far you are through the GIF and how long the GIF is. This is very similar to the progress indicator displayed in apps like Snapchat and Instagram when viewing stories.

* GIFs maintain their progress between screens. This means that if you’re on the front page watching a lengthy GIF, you can tap to see the comments and maintain your place in the GIF. The video I mentioned at the beginning of the post shows this off nicely.

* Swipe left on a GIF to restart it.

* Select you’re favorite subreddits to be Quick Action subreddits. These subreddits will be accessible from Monochrome’s app icon via a 3D Touch. (Pro)

* Get notifications when you receive a post reply, comment reply, mention, or message. 3D Touch these notifications to quick reply, similar to how you’d reply to a text message.

* Intuitive messaging interface that looks almost identical to the stock Messages.app interface.

* Ability to delete conversations from your inbox.

* Swipe on a comment to collapse the comment tree. This feature is straight from Alien Blue. Easily one of my personal favorite features, something you get used to and then can’t live without. (Pro)

* Add multiple accounts and switch between them with a tap. (Multiple accounts is a Pro feature, single account is free)

* Watch the video I mentioned at the beginning of the post to get a better idea of how the following 3D Touch features work.

* 3D Touch a link to an Imgur album to see a natively rendered preview. Tap a link to an Imgur album to see the album natively presented.

* 3D Touch a YouTube link to watch the video in a natively rendered preview. If a timestamp is present in the YouTube link, the timestamp will be honored. The timestamp feature also supports multiple formats: t=12, t=12s, t=1m, t=1m12s. Also, the timestamp can be present as a parameter of the URL or as part of the URL’s fragment. Tapping a YouTube link will simply jump straight to fullscreen playback. Zero web content.

* 3D Touch a link to a GIF/image for a natively rendered preview. Tapping a link to a GIF functions just like tapping a YouTube link, immediate fullscreen playback. Tapping a link to an image presents a native fullscreen image viewer where you can pan the image and pinch to zoom.

* 3D Touch links to other things on reddit, such as subreddits, users, or posts, to see a natively rendered preview. Tapping links to other things on reddit simply navigates to them.

* 3D Touch links to articles to see a preview presented by an SFSafariViewController. Likewise, tap to simply see the SFSafariViewController fullscreen.

* Monochrome uses the standard iOS navigation paradigms and interface components. Since they’re developed by Apple, they’re polished and smooth.

* If you have an iPhone 7/7+, you will receive haptic feedback while interacting with various parts of Monochrome.

I’m going to continue to support Monochrome with updates every 1-2 weeks. Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about my app. I hope you give it a shot!",432,1659,2017-06-17,AAPL,0.0436269287019968,0.9278198480606079,0.02855319157242775

The Android version had a separate pro version on Google Play Store. This one however has lifetime access on single purchase.
1$ = nearly 64 rupees. That's cheap!


Anyways, decide to start free trial, and check out if all features I had on android were still there.

[Purchase History](http://imgur.com/BWEy8Uf)
Clicked on the 'Start Free Trial' button and BAM!
Not even a popup warning me about it making a purchase, no dialog showing it made a purchase.
122.5$ from my account- gone. That's not even close to the 99cent price!


I really trusted apple  store.I read how the devs complained that it has strict admission policies compared to Google Play Store, so I trusted the App Store, and got wrecked.
I registered a complaint with [Report a problem](https://reportaproblem.apple.com) and  am waiting for apple support to call me back. Any tips to get my money back?

Also I feel this isn't a proper subreddit for this. Any pointers if I'm wrong?

__Update__: Got contacted by Apple Support.
They were super helpful, I'm being refunded within 10 business days.

Coming from android, the overcall customer care and support sure feels great!

apple,The Apple Watch feature I once thought was a throwaway novelty is now crucial to me.,"Not sure how many people frequently use the digital touch heartbeat on their Apple Watch, but I wasn't one of them until a month ago. I bought my Apple Watch when it first came out, and my wife and I exchanged heartbeat messages maybe two or three times and then never used it again. Last month, my sister passed away from a rare form of cancer. While she was on her deathbed, my wife suggested taking her pulse with my Watch, just to see how she was doing internally. I gently rested the watch on her wrist, took the pulse, and, in the process, remembered the heartbeat feature. I sent her heartbeat to myself, so I could easily keep track of where it was. She passed away a few hours later. Today, whenever I need to feel as though she's with me, I just bring up that heartbeat and let it pulse. I wanted to share this with fellow Apple enthusiasts, as a use case I never thought about when I bought my watch, and one I hope you'll remember going forward if you're ever in a similar situation.

TL;DR my sister passed away and I use the digital touch heartbeat to keep her with me.

Edit: I had some people asking what kind of cancer (and others pointing out the potential to raise awareness), so I'll share it here. She had Small Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary Hypercalcemic. My family was told it affects 1% of women in the world, but I don't have the link to back that up.

Does this sound right?  Is that standard practice to replace the whole phone in this case?  Do they give her a refurbished phone and expect her old one in exchange?

apple,Apple Store experience (from an ex Android user),"Hi Guys. 

Just wanted to share my experience in an Apple Store with my iPhone 7 Plus. 

Quick backstory: Android user for many years (not fanboy level, but definitely enamoured with the OS) but switched to iPhone 7 Plus in November coming from a Google Pixel (did a straight swap actually on our version of Swappa). 

I switched because of the portrait mode on the camera and ironically about a week ago it just stopped working - the front and back camera including the flash (even flashlight wouldn't work). 

Booked an appointment online went to the Genius Bar today - had a super warm greeting and within five minutes of a diagnostic had a brand new iPhone 7 Plus in my hand. 

The guy even said ""we just want to make sure our customers are satisfied"". Holy shit - I was so gobsmacked by the service that I sympathy bought some goodies in there. 

I also saw firsthand the power of iCloud back ups. 

I know there's a lot of bashing of Apple, sometimes from Apple customers and often from others, but the sum of all the parts of hardware, software and service is second to none. 

In fact, going to another OEM doesn't make any sense as I don't know how I could have that peace of mind. 

Sorry for the long post - but well done Apple.

apple,PSA: Genius Bar Replacements are not refurbished,"I have noticed many posts stating that when you get your phone swapped at the Genius Bar, you receive a refurbished unit as a replacement. 

This is entirely false in itself and this misinformation can resonate especially when spread by users. 

Apple has an internal classification for devices and two separate processes for building devices. 

Refurbished devices, by definition are used devices that have been cleaned up and were priorly used. 

A company who puts out phones of Refurbished quality is Assurion. Those phones are usually mismatched IMEI, have a different purchase date then your original purchase and come with bugs down the line. 

Apple also has refurbished devices. But Apple’s refurbished devices have previously activated IMEI that are traced back to the original owner, have been used with slight part replacement/re coloring of body. These aren’t what you get when you get your device swapped at Apple. 

Genius Bar refurbished devices are brand new. The IMEI is unregistered and the externals and all internals except the logic board are brand new. If the board was used it is given a new imei and outer housing to match the IMEI. The screen is also brand new and all internals are new. In Apple’s internal program iLOG, or MobileGenius replacement devices match customers original purchase date and do not have a refurbished tag next to them, as refurbished units do. They also come with a new manufacturing date. 

So while in the Genius Bar replacement units logic boards may sometimes be reused, it is still not refurbishment due to the fact no customers hands have held the device and activation with network or the customer data base is unregistered. Most of the times Genius Bar units are new, as they are manufactured along side production. Can’t have a reused logic board on launch day if someone has to swap their product?


Edit: TL;DR they are remanufactured and rebranded as new, not refurbished",93,230,2017-06-19,AAPL,0.04893285036087036,0.9153509140014648,0.035716261714696884

apple,It's frustrating how far behind iCloud Drive is compared to Google Drive.,"Even seemingly basic tasks can't be accomplished with iCloud Drive.  Here are a few quick examples off the top of my head:

1. I can't share files by sending a link.  If I need to share a 100mb file, Google Drive lets me email someone a quick link to download it.  iCloud Drive offers to let me email it, which won't work due to its size.  MailDrop is available, but not for all email accounts.  
2. My fiancé and I want to make a shared folder called ""Wedding Planning.""  Inside it, we could each see, create, and edit various documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.  This can be done in like 3 clicks on Google Drive but is impossible on iCloud Drive.
3. If I am browsing a folder on Google and Drive and decide I want to make a new spreadsheet in that folder, I can just hit New Sheet and immediately begin working.  There are no buttons inside iCloud Drive to create new files.  
4. On the mobile app, there's no way to mark things for offline viewing.
5. When saving things into iCloud Drive from another mobile app, it shows this weird expanded list of subfolders.  Who thought this was a good idea?  It makes finding what I'm looking for incredibly confusing.

These really are not ground-breaking features I'm asking for, Google Drive has had these as long as I remember.  I greatly prefer iCloud Drive over Google Drive since w/ Google you don't actually own the files, they're just stored on Google's servers.

apple,Here's why I gave up on Apple Music,"I went back to a normal iTunes library, here's why:

- Randomly greyed out songs every single day
- Sometimes even offline saved music wasn't playable when not connected to the Internet
- Some explicit songs suddenly changed to censored ones
- They replaced random songs with other versions
- You still have to heart songs so Apple Music knows your taste instead of just looking at your most played songs or library
- The search on iOS sometimes only shows up a blank page even if you search for ordinary stuff like ""Britney Spears""
- Lack of special interest music like J-pop, K-pop, city pop, video game soundtracks, anime soundtracks...
- Apple Music often doesn't care what you're listening to but in what country you live. You live in Germany and listen to Swedish pop music all the time? Here's a list of 5 German hip hop musicians, 5 German folk singers and 5 German techno DJs!
- No international chart playlists just the ones which are available in your country
- So many artist pages are completely empty
- Songs which are available in the US aren't available in Europe - and vice versa
- Different artists who share the same name sometimes even share the same artist page
- Siri understands only the most common artists and songs
- Many artists don't have a profile photo
- Randomly added songs to my library I haven't even listened to before
- Randomly deleted songs, not just greyed out, but completely deleted
- Apple Music suddenly deleted all my playlists in the three months I am subscribed to Apple Music now. Twice.

apple,Just switched from Galaxy Tab to 2017 iPad,"I wasn't really planning to get an iPad until I heard about the 2017 iPad. It's basically the SE version of the iPad and for what you're getting I feel it's worth the money.

For the last few years I have been using a 7 inch Galaxy Tab 4 and nowadays I can't bear it because of how slow and outdated it is. So today I have picked up the 2017 iPad.

First of all, the screen is pretty huge since I am so used to 7 inch displays. I know there was the iPad mini but since it wasn't updated for so long I opted for the 2017 iPad instead so I don't need to upgrade again for the next few years. Second, iOS 11. After hearing about all the cool things about iOS 11 and how it makes it more like a mini Mac, iPads seem to have a much brighter future compared to Android tablets. That combined with the seamless iOS experience, you don't have to maintain it so much compared to an Android tablet.

I also got the Smart Cover for it, and I'm amazed at how easy it makes it for me to type on. It's nearly a laptop experience, although you don't get the physical feedback from the keys, it's great. I'm typing this post on my iPad right now.

After booting it up for the first time I'm surprised to see it came with 10.3.2 out of the box! I didn't even need to update it.

I have now fully migrated to iOS as my mobile platform of choice, starting with the iPhone SE I got a few months ago. I'm very happy with my iPad purchase and I look forward to seeing more great products from Apple.

That being said, I'm new to iPad, so any iPad tips and tricks in the comments are very appreciated.",74,233,2017-06-25,AAPL,0.01619897410273552,0.8102981448173523,0.17350289225578308

apple,So Apple charged me 14 lots of Apple Music 12 month subscriptions today,"[Screenshot of part of my iTunes receipts](https://imgur.com/a/oYyZw)

Received a call from my CC company notifying me of possible fraud transactions but were from Apple iTunes. I checked online to find 4 transactions of $119 which appeared to be a glitch so I spoke to Apple online support and managed to get it refunded. 

Fast forward a few hours and I log on to see more of the same $119 transactions, again spoke to Apple online support and they organised to have this lot refunded. Just as I was finishing up the online conversation with support they mentioned I should call the Apple security team if more of these transactions pop up, well guess what, another $119 got charged to my CC. Called the security team and explained what had happened and asked what I could do to stop whatever this is from happening again because I’m not keen on asking for refunds everyday. He assured me it wouldn’t happen but he put his supervisor on the phone. 

Supervisor was super nice and provided me her direct email and to notify her if anymore of the same happens. Well as it turns out as soon as I hung up the phone I got another one! So I emailed her to let her know, again she got this lot refunded and suggested as a temporary measure to unlink my CC from iTunes altogether. Now I guess we’ll wait and see but I’m avoiding adding another card just to have this happen again ...

apple,"PSA: Apple is not obligated to provide you with any maintenance, technical or other support for the Pre-Release Software (iOS 11)","Source: [Apple Beta Software Program Agreement, bullet point #9](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/legal)


&gt;9.  No Support and Maintenance; Future Products. 


**What does this mean to me, as a user running iOS 11 Beta (or any beta software)?**

* Apple has the right to refuse technical support related to the beta software, including but not limited to assisting you with downgrading your device back to iOS 10. As per the Terms and Conditions you, the user, agreed to when installing iOS 11 Public Beta, Apple makes no guarantee that pre-release software will even work, and you even risk losing your data.
* If support is offered, no troubleshooting will be done and the only option positioned will be to downgrade back to a publicly released version of iOS (at this time, 10.3.2) — this means WIPING your device.
* Your backups from iOS 11 *WILL NOT WORK* on iOS 10.
* Hardware repairs will be declined on devices running iOS 11 (screen, camera, etc.) as it will fail calibration tests, due to the calibration equipment not yet updated to support iOS 11, and they won't be until iOS 11 has been publicly released this fall. The only exceptions MAY BE because we need to swap a device (i.e. the device does not power on due to liquid damage), but *no* *guarantees*. You will be advised to downgrade back to iOS 10 first before we can support hardware repairs.


**This sounds ridiculous!**

Not really, considering you have to jump through hoops to even install pre-release software to begin with. When iOS 11 can be installed through an OTA (Over The Air) update normally WITHOUT any additional profiles installed, then you know you have a publicly released version — this won't happen until Fall 2017.


**So, what am I supposed to do then if I absolutely need support?**

Do what you can to downgrade your iOS device back to the latest publicly released version of iOS 10 available (at this time, 10.3.2). Apple has written a guide on how you can do that here: [Restore Shipping Software - iOS](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/restore#ios)

Chances are, downgrading will solve most/all of your software issues by itself. If you continue to have issues, AND you are now on iOS 10 again, we would more than love to help you out and determine what's going on with your device. If you're having hardware issues, such as a cracked display, downgrading to iOS 10 will allow us to run calibration tests on your new display once replaced.


Knowing all the information above will help either save you a trip to the Genius Bar, or be better prepared and informed on what to expect should you need to go in for repairs.

Can't think of a single reason why they removed it. This feature, while a lot of people didn't know about it (similar to 3D-Touch Keyboard trackpad), was extremely useful to people who did know about it. I find it far more elegant and smoother than double-clicking the home button; it just felt better. Send feedback folks. Maybe they will change their mind before iOS 11 ships.
