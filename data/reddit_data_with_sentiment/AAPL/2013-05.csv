iphone,I think AT&amp;T is hosing me on my data usage. Does anyone else feel the same way?,"I'm pretty sure AT&amp;T is hosing me. I've had AT&amp;T + iPhones for the past 3 years. Never broken the 2GB limit. Now, I've broken the 2GB limit every month for the past 6 months and I haven't changed my habits at all. What made me suspect that AT&amp;T was bs-ing their numbers was that on two separate occasions, I've received conflicting numbers.

One day, around 8am, I received a text from AT&amp;T saying I had used 65% of my 2GB. Ok, fine, whatever. 3pm later that same day, I received another text from AT&amp;T saying that I had exceeded my 2GB limit and was now incurring charges. Mind you, during this 7 hours, I was busy at work and only texted and got on facebook a few times.

This month, I got a text at 2pm saying I was incurring charges but never received a warning text as I usually would. So, I logged into att at around 3pm and checked my usage. The website read: ""This usage data is current as of 3:34am today"". This would be able 10.5 hours prior and it said I had only used 1400mb. Again, this would mean I used 600+mb in 10.5 hours between sleeping &amp; working.

Chatted an AT&amp;T rep and he said ""You have an iPhone 5 and it's faster - therefore you use more data"" which makes absolutely no sense.

So, my iPhone is jailbroken so I downloaded a jailbreak app called 'Usage monitor' that tracks every bit of data going in/out of my iphone using cellular data. At the end of the month, I'll compare what I have to what they have. 


Has anyone else noticed this?

iphone,50 Free Promo Codes for Caption Distraction (an app that turns a photo into a comic),"UPDATE: I'm sorry but we've run out of promo codes. Apple only gives out 50 and just a moment ago I gave the last one out. The best I can do right now is if you want the app but don't want to pay for it, I have a couple of extra spots for beta testers. Please keep in mind though that the next beta version of the app won't come out for a couple of weeks. 
Otherwise, the app is still obviously available in the app store for the low price of $1.99. I feel it's well worth it because even though this niche is crowded, this app still does a bunch of unique things that the other comic / caption apps don't do. Please consider purchasing Caption Distraction from the app store, and as always if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions about anything, feel free to send me a message here or at admin@captiondistraction.com. Thanks!

Hi all, 

I wanted to tell you about my first app which I recently submitted to the app store. The name of the app is Caption Distraction and it allows you to turn a photo into a comic using word balloons, sound effects, and filters. It also allows you to insert popular memes / rage guys into your photos. Here is a link to the apps display page in the app store which has four examples of the app:

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caption-distraction/id641361892?mt=8&amp;uo=4

Just to be clear, it doesn't do paneled comics (yet). However, one thing it does do that I haven't seen else where is it allows you to add color to the individual components of the rage guys (i.e. skin, hair, teeth, etc - there is an example in the above link).

If this sounds like the type of app that might be useful to you, send me a private message and I'll give you a promo code to download a free copy of the app. Please note that I only have 50 of these promo codes to give out and they will be given out on a first come first served basis.

Otherwise if you have any questions about the app, please feel free to e-mail me at admin@captiondistraction.com, send me a private message, or leave a comment below. 

For those that do download the app, I'd love to hear your feed back! Also, if you have any recommendations for rage guys / memes to add, please let me know and I'll do my best to add them as soon as possible. 

Thanks!

Plus I get a 15% service discount through my employer, so I am not really saving anything by switching.

iphone,"New iPhone user (coming from Android), need help. Can't understand basic things about iOS.","Hi to all. I bought an iPhone 5 (I used to have a Samsung Galaxy 3) and I love the smoothness of the interface and the quality ""feel"" of the device. 

The problem is that the difference between iOS and Android is way bigger than I expected, and I can't seem to do stuff on the iPhone that is basic on Android.

For example, sharing stuff: on android to share (for example) a photo I'd select it in the gallery, selected ""share"" and I would get a list of all the apps installed on the system that I could use to share the photo with. Both built-n apps and 3rd party would show up in this list. On iOS it seems that only a few options are available. For example, to share a photo with whatsapp I'd select whatsapp from the list and the photo would be instantly be sent to the contact I would choose. Same goes for dropbox, gmail, etc. I haven't found  way to do this on my iPhone.

Another thing, the wifi seems to disconnect when the phone is locked. Does this mean that any network activity will stop unless I keep the phone awake? What happens if I'm downloading apps and stuff? Will I receive new mail notifications etc. when the phone is locked?

Third thing: I'm in the Netherlands but I don't speak a word of Dutch. I set the system language to English and the region to the Netherlands, but this way I get stuff like the date in Dutch. Is there a way to have the date in English without changing other settings (currency, date format, etc)?

Last thing (I promise), related to the previous one: if I select the app store of an English-speaking country it will not accept my Dutch credit card. The only way to buy stuff is to have the app store in Dutch. Is there any way around this?

1. Make sure your printer is connected and powered on
1. Go to System Preferences and select ""Print &amp; Scan""
1. From the Printers list on the left select the printer you want and drag it to the Desktop to create an alias (you can rename it, of course)
1. Drag and drop single or multiple documents onto your new Desktop Printer

apple,"A friendly PSA: If you have an iPhone, remember to set it up with the FindMyiPhone App!","This post isn't to ask for advice on what to do in my situation, or anything of that sort. Just a reminder for those of you who see it that shit happens, people suck, and unless you take precautions there might not be anything you can do.

I was taking a cab home last night from Manhattan to Brooklyn, and my pretty much still brand new 32gb iPhone 4 was stolen. By the taxi driver. Not left on the seat and not turned in, physically taken out of my pocket without me immediately noticing. As I stepped away from the cab, I reached into my pocket as I had felt my phone vibrate while the driver was handing me change, only to find an empty pocket and the taxi hurriedly driving off. It being 3:30am, and myself having a headache which was the reason I took the cab in the first place as opposed to the subway, I hadn't bothered to look at the cab number or driver's name.

I ran up the stairs to my apartment and knocked on my roommates door, asking her to call my phone because I was 99% sure it was just lifted off of me. She reminded me that I could probably track it if it wasn't off, so I tried calling it to no avail, and then logged into mobileme, only to realize that I hadn't actually gone into the settings to configure the FindMyiPhone App, I had only registered my Apple ID with my device.

Clearly, my entire situation could have been avoided had I taken minor precautions, but I didn't. Fortunately the rep I spoke to while reactivating my old phone was kind enough to reset my upgrade date because that would pretty much be the only way for me to get a replacement without having to purchase it myself (Yes, I skipped out on the insurance. Bad decision, right? Yup.)  I had already gotten lucky once by getting the 32gb for free (the store I went to was out of 8gb so they bumped me up to what was in stock), but I was still convinced mentally that **I** wouldn't get my phone stolen off of me. I mean, I'm generally aware of my surroundings, I don't walk around flaunting it like some people tend to, but then I quickly learned that none of that matters. It's simply a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person. 

I could have easily gotten into a different cab, but I didn't. I could have not gone around to the window for the driver despite thinking it was a bit sketchy, but I did anyway. I could have set up the tracking app, but I didn't. I sure as hell will as soon as I get my replacement though",14,57,2013-05-18,AAPL,0.17007988691329956,0.7981371879577637,0.03178287297487259

iphone,"Hi r/iphone! I grew tired of the stock Emoji, so I made a free app that animates your own face inside of iMessage. Check it out!","I made a free app that animates your face automatically inside iMessages. It's called ""Animotions for iMessage"" and you can check it out here:
[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animotions-for-imessage/id645677752?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animotions-for-imessage/id645677752?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2)

This is my first app in the App Store that I've written completely on my own during my free time. I have no concrete plans for it (other than that it will remain completely free and ad-free). I only want people to have fun with it!

**Anyways, I'd love some feedback from reddit on how I can make it better.** What do you like about it? What parts do you hate? I'm super open to implementing your ideas and suggestions. Thanks!

**EDIT: Thanks for the kind words, everyone! You are seriously awesome. Based on the feedback thus far, here's some things I need to do in the next release:**

* Edit button to re-record Animotions without having to delete/re-create
* Don't cover part of the Animotion with the title at the bottom
* Make it easier to delete un-recorded Animotions
* Ability to simply copy an Animotion to the clipboard
* Bugfix: Animotion titles at the bottom are covered by the keyboard when editing
* Transferring Animotions to other devices (for people with iPhone, iPad, etc.)
* Adding text to Animotions!
* Save Animotions to camera roll
* Import video and convert to Animotion

EDIT (5/22/13 @ 3:06AM PST): Holy crap, you guys/gals got Animotions to rank #233 of 300 on the top free Photo &amp; Video apps! I love you all! I'm going to sleep now, but I'll check back again tomorrow to answer any more questions / suggestions you might have. Thanks again!

EDIT (5/22/13 @ 11:22AM PST): Wow, r/iphone, you made it climb 100 spots overnight! This is seriously incredible. I'll be checking the thread throughout the day to answer any more questions :)

apple,I finally made the switch.,"r/apple, I finally bought my first Mac.

My Hp laptop self-destructed (literally fell apart) and instead of buying a new Windows 8 laptop, I shelled out some extra cash to get a 13"" Macbook Pro. I've been using Windows since the age of 4 (23 now).

I've had it for 3 days now, and I can tell what I've been missing out on. This computer is awesome.
The things I love:

The Display:
I didnt opt for a retina display, but still this screen is gorgeous.

The Trackpad:
It's literally like I'm using an iPhone. All the gestures are insane

The Interface:
I've had experience in the past with using Mac Pros in my school's broadcasting lab for editing purposes. I liked the interface then and now that i've dug a little deeper I enjoy it even more.

GarageBand:
I'm an amatuer guitarist, and having this to record simple music productions is awesome. One of the first things I plan to purchase is guitar input and condenser mic.



That being said, I'm very new to apple culture (I own an iPhone but don't really use it for more than music or phone purposes). What suggestions do you all have for me to check out? I'm talking things like:

Hardware,
Software,
Apps,
Games,
Things bundled with my Mac I haven't checked yet,
etc.

Almost any suggestions, advice, etc is much appreciated!",117,154,2013-05-25,AAPL,0.026328230276703835,0.9284458756446838,0.04522590711712837

apple,I feel like Apple services get way too much hate.,"I really don't understand the hate. I guess compared to Google, there are a lot of areas for improvement, but my experience with Apple services has generally been very positive. In fact, they're the main reasons it would be hard for me to leave the Apple ecosystem.

And while Google may be better at many services (like voice search, maps), there are a lot of areas that Apple has excelled at since iOS 5 that Google is just beginning to make ground on (messaging, gaming).

Is there anyone out there as happy with Apple services as I am? Here's a list of services and what I like about them.


**iMessage:** this one is a given. In the year and half that I've relied on iMessage, I've experienced one outage, and it wasn't that bad. The fact that it's built into the default messaging apps means tons of my friends use it, even if they're not tech savvy. It's fast, available on all my Apple devices, and makes me really enjoy messaging. While Google Hangouts has generated a lot of buzz recently, iMessage really makes it difficult to walk away from an iPhone and iOS.


**Photo Stream:** I feel like this service is very underrated, although I definitely think Apple could do a better job at marketing it. But that doesn't mean it's not great. I never plug my phone into my computer, and yet I know that all of my pictures, which to me are the most valuable and irreplaceable content on my phone, are safe and present on all my devices. While Dropbox offers a similar service, you have to remember to import it to iPhoto and clear out the files to save space within Dropbox. Photo Stream is really fantastically seamless.


**iCloud Backups and Find my iPhone:** I plug my devices in every night, so I know that if anything happens to the device, I have a backup from the night before. When I upgrade to a new phone, it restores everything, from my apps to my settings. And Find my iPhone makes it that much easier to find my phone around my apartment, and it seems like it will be helpful in the event of a robbery. 


**iTunes Match:** So worth the $25 a year. I always hated syncing my music to my device via iTunes. Now I add a song or album to iTunes, and it's on my phone and iPad. No matter where I am, I can access that music. Plus, it allows me to easily download and delete songs, so I can save my precious space for apps and things without having to compromise my music library.


**Documents in the Cloud:** this works well, but dammit I really hate how locked into apps it is. The potential is huge, and when I'm composing a document in Pages on my Mac and my iPad, it's damn near magical. But that file can't be shared or opened in another app without creating copies that don't sync and really make a mess in the file system. If Apple's goal here is to simply the file system, their method isn't working. I have hope that they'll address this.


**iCloud Syncing:** Again, seamless. My notes, reminders, calendar, Safari tabs, and contacts are always up to date on all my devices. I have never experienced an issue with the syncing of any of these services, and it's about as automatic as it gets. 


**Maps:** ...it's gotten better, and it will continue to. But yeah, can't really say a lot to defend this other than they had to do it if they ever wanted turn-by-turn directions as a feature.


Has anyone had any problems with the services I've listed? I feel like I read articles all the time about how Apple lags behind in services and their current offerings are terrible, but I really feel that they have many excellent services, and others that will definitely get better. I've been tempted by some Android phones recently (HTC One is very sexy) but then I think about losing these services that I'm so plugged into. Photo Stream is huge for me, iMessage, etc. And I sure as hell trust Apple a lot more with my data than Google.

About the game (from our website):

SUGU is mind puzzling multiplayer game based on symbols. You compete against friends or random players with the aim of making as many points as possible with the tiles at your disposal. The tactical aim of the game is to place the tiles on the board in a formation that will maximize the number of points. The player who first uses all of his or her tiles ends the game. The player with most points wins the game.

apple,Trying to gauge interest in an overclocking guide? I'm considering writing one for this subreddit.,"Hello /r/Apple

I'm trying to see if anyone here is interested in Overclocking their macs. Specifically the GPU's. 

If enough people are interested, I'll post a guide on how I managed a stable 30% overclock on my macbook pro, while *lowering* the operating temperatures

In the meantime, here's some proof :) 
http://i.imgur.com/QUgFzAb.jpg

If anyone's interested, please let me know.



If you're curious about performance: 

* playing Crysis 3, at default low settings and 1680x1050 I went from I went from 30 FPS at the Stock 600/800 to 42 FPS at 775/975, all while keeping the system cooler than it's been running. So, let me know what your thoughts are :) 
* Skyrim went from a choppy 25-30 FPS to a smooth 33-40 FPS, maxed out at 1680x1050

I decided to post in /r/Apple because this post is for giving back to the community here. Mods, please notify me if this should be in /r/AppleHelp

Edit: I would like to clarify that this will be about overclocking under *windows* via boot camp, just to eke out some more gaming performance :)",32,71,2013-05-27,AAPL,0.0412919856607914,0.9282146692276001,0.030493367463350296

apple,Quick advice for anyone planning to put an SSD in their MacBook Pro,"There are many options to put an SSD in your MacBook or MacBook Pro but my goal was to have a seamless transition in the shortest amount of time possible. I had no issues with my system so I used Carbon Copy Cloner to make a clone of my HDD onto my SSD. I put the SSD in my MBP and booted up. 

Immediately, the MBP got hot. Uncomfortably hot. Too hot to touch. So I powered down my machine and researched it. Eventually, I discovered that swapping a drive can sometimes confuse the System Management Controller. 

There is a guide to [reset the settings here.](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US)

In short:

* Plug your laptop into the wall. 
* Press and hold SHIFT+CRTL+OPTION+POWER and release all buttons at the same time. 
* Count to 10
* Power ON your laptop. 

This fixed my heat issue instantly. 

Thought I would pass along the advice as many people are going to SSD's now and the temps after I swapped would have eventually fried my board.

apple,"Hello r/apple, Android user here. I'm impressed.","First off all, please dont spread the hate, this is just a compliment.
Second: Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.

Yesterday i finally got to try 2 Apple product in my uncle house. He works at the local phone store and he bought home this 2 cuties:

Iphone 4 and the Second Generation Ipad. Not the newest models i know, but they still impressed me:
Heres the list

**Smoothness** When i saw the size of RAM i was shock. 512 MB. 
My new Xperia J mobil has the same specific like this 2 but still: 
The iPhone and iPad runs so well while like Android phone feels slow. 
And thats a 2012 4Q mobile. A half year old phone!
While the iPad 2 is 2 years old and the iPhone 4 is **3** years old.  devices but  they both supress my phone. Touching time is joy, no lag. Just wow. 


**Messaging system:**: iMessage. Best messaging system i ever used on a phone. 

**Display:** Again, both devices being quite old, still amazes me. While the iPad has a HD display (1,024 × 768) its easily tops my 480p mobile, and the iPhone what again its a 3 years old mobil, its IPS display and 640p ressouliton almost got my tears. The only thing i dont like here is the screen size. But again, other than that its still better

**Battery life**: I managed to use both system for 2-3 hour and only 20-25% went down while using Wifi, gaming, videos ETC. Nice

**Browser:** Safari (Like the Device) Runs smoothly but it still preffer Chrome on android. But if we see the year 2010-2011 when there was no chrome on mobile devices, Safari beats the stock browser on android



There are two things i didn't reallyl ike.

**The lack off costumization**: The iOS UI is perfect and user friendly. But i kinda disliked i could'n really change the anything. While its not a mayor issue, still for here i preffer the Android UI

**The prices**: Yeah yeah im sorry, but like a said before, usually the apple products are not so cheap.... and i said before, i'm not english, im hungarian and the prices here (Thanks for our grovement) adds usually 20-40% to any technology product. For Explane: The Ps vita cost 364 dollar instead of the 250

And would i change my phone too and the current generation off iPhone: Well maybe

Both (all phones9 has itt pro's and con's but i while i'm impressed, i dont know how the curnet generation of phone feels... Iphone 5 or a Samsung Galaxy S4.. I dont know jack. Yeah sure I could read some reviews about peoples option. But i preffer the ""Try both and choose"" method instead to ""Listen to this guy""  

I hope i got my shit togheter and didn't said anything stupid (Wiki helped me alot).

&gt;re-use a native AppleTV app (in this case Apple Trailers)

&gt;re-route the Trailers app requests to your local Plex Media Server

&gt;re-work the reply to fit into AppleTV's XML communication scheme

&gt;let iOS do the rest

&gt;enjoy Plex on your unmodified AppleTV


Quite a nifty little trick that works wonders.  Haven't seen it mentioned on here anywhere so I thought I'd just post as I'm sure many people (like myself) use their AppleTV almost exclusively for Plex.

But have you viewed true 4K video yet?
Alot of people think they're viewing 4K just because they're told it is. when in reality the compression done on alot of those videos is downright amateur, or they don't realize that Flash player is only displaying 1080P
i have recently downloaded ClickToPlugin for Safari and found a few Videos on youtube with an incredible lack of compression, very high quality, and wanted to share with fellow retina owners.
Hoping that maybe you would share some demos and trailers you may have found with particularly stunning quality. (esp movie trailers, most seem to be German)
