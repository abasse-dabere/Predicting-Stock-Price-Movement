ecommerce,Ecommerce provider,"Hey All,

I run a computer consulting business. I'm looking at expanding my business to E-commerce. I currently do sales right now, however it is on more of a quote-out enterprise level. 

I've already purchased some domain names.

However, what i'm looking for is a provider for Ecommerce. Ideally, what i'm going to be doing is - Receiving an XML file of products and prices from my distributor, uploading those to the web-site and adjusting prices accordingly. Adding pictures/descriptions. Having the products be able to link with an Amazon Market Place, and even a Ebay store. 

I've looked at Shopify, Volusion, 1and1. It's difficult to read through the information and determine which is the best one.

Any suggestions from personal experiences/Trials and Tribulations?",9,6,2015-06-01,ECOM,0.029370484873652458,0.9354689121246338,0.035160552710294724
ecommerce,Aspiring young entrepreneur needing help regarding ecommerce and web development (mainly Shopify),"Greetings, I am a brazilian 16 years old with a taste for entrepreneurship. I have a product, a niche and some people interested, so I decided to start an ecommerce business. The thing is, I have been struggling to create a website the way I want to. I tried Wordpress and Shopify (which I prefer).

It is a single product, so ideally I would have just a nice minimalistic page explaining it, so people would quickly understand my idea and then buy it. Something like a 3 (or less) steps purchase. I also want to add a field besides the regular ones.

What is the best way to do this? Is it possible just using the Shopify interface, is there a good theme for this? Or should I learn CSS/HTML/Liquid? I didn't like any of the themes I tried, they were ugly or just too complicated for my target audience, but it might be just me not knowing how to set them up. 

Thank you for your help!",7,5,2015-06-01,ECOM,0.017620040103793144,0.9142752289772034,0.06810466200113297

This website is very bare minimum MVP that I plan on just launching and developing over time with extra functionalities. What are some functionalities that you believe I should prioritize?

So we have a dilemma - we have a fishing wordpress blog that is getting some (not many but enough to keep us interested) hits and we are opening a store with some custom made products on shopify. 

The blog was originally started as a diary of our fishing adventures but now we are looking at using it as a diary + indepth guide on how to use our products that we are selling at our store.

So questions:

* Do you think it is wise to have our personal adventures in the store blog (sometimes using the products we sell)?
* How do we go about setting this up? I have read that to get the best SEO the blog should be a subfolder (domain.com/blog)but the only way I can figure out having wordpress + shopify is to have it as a subdomain (blog.domain.com).
* Is the shopify blogging platform as bad as it's make it out to be?
* Branding: Currently our blog has a very different name to the store. Should we change it to something like ""StoreName Blog""?

* The guy basically brushed me off the phone as quickly as he could instead of understanding that I've got other shipments I'd potentially move to UPS as well if I could get the rates

ecommerce,IRCE 2015,"Hello all,

Today is the final day of Internet Retailer Conference + Exhibition in Chicago. Was anyone from this subreddit there in attendance? Or still there in attendance? I myself was there for my 4th or 5th time at the conference. I actually found the conference this year, in my opinion to be a little lackluster in sessions.

Interesting enough one of the co-founders of reddit, Alexis Ohanian, was one of the keynote speakers on Wednesday. I thought his keynote was great. Really all about how you don’t always need to know exactly what you are doing. That it is okay to admit that you might not know what your product or company is going to be in 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year and that is okay.
I found most of the keynotes to be very well done, give a lot of insight into how we should be thinking about the industry.

As always, even if the sessions there don’t seem to be tailored to what you want or need to learn more about it is always a great destination to meet with vendors and advertisers who you may never otherwise see face to face. It is always a great place to find new advertisers and vendors as well with their ridiculous large exhibition hall.

I was looking to opening up a discussion to see what peoples thoughts are with IRCE2015 this year. If they had any “a-ha” moments or any eye opening moments – or – just to start a discussion on what area of focus you might have been looking at and how it went for you. Any and all discussion surrounding IRCE 2015 and what you learned, thought, experienced are welcome.",2,1,2015-06-05,ECOM,0.022293241694569588,0.9225736856460571,0.055133089423179626

ecommerce,Conversion Optimization &amp; Testing: Do you do it? How do you do it? All about it.,"Hello all, thought I would pick a topic near and dear to my heart that I think everyone should be working on - conversion optimization &amp; testing.

If you don't know what conversion optimization and testing are, you should. Especially if you have a lot of customers/visitors on your site and are able to get a lot of data fast. Conversion optimization &amp; testing is the act of using tools to show a/b variants or multiple variants on a page and finding out which works best. By doing so you can optimize your page to find out what speaks to your customers and what gets them to convert.

For instance you can change up your text ""checkout now"", ""cheakout"", ""begin checkout"" etc.

You can change up your button colors - try different ones.

You can test all sorts of things, hypothesizing what may be helpful or possibly hurting your page. Possibly something you want to launch, test it to make sure it doesn't do harm.

So I have a lot of questions to ask on the subject, my questions are:

- how are you deciding what to test?
- are you using analytics information to figure out where you should test first? find lowest haging fruit?
- what have been your biggest successes in testing?
- how often are you testing?
- what tools are you using for testing?

Currently, I am looking into visual website optimizer as a tool to use internally but we are looking into a ton of others as well, as well as consultants who only work in optimization. Just wondering what route others are taking, what successes have you seen, etc. Would help for me personally to get ideas in this space. If there seems to be a lot of people joining this conversation I will list some of the different vendors &amp; companies I found around optimization. But please feel free to post anything - vendors, blog posts, etc. Lets get a conversation going.",3,3,2015-06-08,ECOM,0.03319372609257698,0.9298528432846069,0.036953382194042206

ecommerce,Need a suggestion for revamp of store (self hosted or not).,"I'm currently using jigoshop and HATE it with a passion.  Everytime wordpress updates several plugins break and my css tweaks often have to be redone.  I'm looking at moving away from jigoshop, and someone had recommended going to woocommerce as it's very similar but supposedly better supported.  Jigoshop has pretty much 0 support unless you're paying extra for it.  Is woocommerce the same way?  Also, how often do plugins break when there is a wordpress update?  My appeal in switching to woocommerce is that I can keep my current theme since woocommerce and jigoshop can interchange most themes.  

The other option I'm considering is going with something hosted like Volusion.  A monthly fee that includes card processing is nice, and since it's not wordpress driven I'm assuming updates are more seamless.  Of course that is an assumption.  I run this business myself at the moment, so I don't have time to keep patching things and fixing things here and there.  I do need something that easily calculates shipping and integrates with paypal.  My store has less than 500 items, so I can go with Volusions mid grade package that is $35 a month (which is about the same as my current self hosting costs).

ecommerce,New ecommerce store. Shopify or Big commerce?,"Hi

I'm in the process of starting a new company and need to get  my website done. I could say that part of my big differentiation, will be trough inbound marketing, with lots of high quality posts.

Checking the price differences from bigcommerce to shopify, bigcommerce seemed a much better deal, for example lower credit card fees, which is good, specially as I'm bootstrapping.

I decided to go with bigcommerce, opened a trial version for bigcommerce, started playing with it, and bought a theme. Today as I'm playing more with it I see the blog SUCKS, the whole article shows up, now with a 2000+ words article this is a HUGE  problem, specially as my blog posts will be in this range, and I can't have people scrolling down the whole thing to find the article they like . 

I checked again shopify, they have a theme that is exactly what I'm looking for, and what looks like a much better  blog setup. Again bigcommerce seems a much better deal money wise, but reading the other post in this sub apparently bigcommerce crashes a lot.

What do you guys think is better, Shopify or bigcommerce? Doesn't the higher percentage fees in shopify bother you?
Do you agree it's very important to have a good looking and easy blog? Anyway to get the money I paid for my bigcommerce theme back?

TL;DR: opened bigcommerce, but the blog SUCKS, should I pay higher fees and just move to shopify to have a beautiful site?

ecommerce,How to track multiple websites funneling into one ecommerce site.,"I am working with a distributor who wants to have black and white territory restrictions for online sales. If I have territory Tennessee, for instance, and I drive an online sale from someone in California, he does not want to credit me with the sale for commission/compensation's sake simply because it is not my ""territory.""

I am trying to show him that it is not always possible to restrict a website from being found even hundreds of miles away. If I can show him that it is easy to determine which transaction came from which website, I may be able to convince him to be more lenient on his territories online (as opposed to retail).

What would be the easiest way to have the data organized from the distributor's perspective so that this will be a no brainer? I was just considering setting up Google Analytics and having him look at the Conversions &gt; Overview &gt; Referrals for which sales came from which website.

ecommerce,Using Google Tag Manager to implement Google Analytics with Enhanced Ecommerce on Shopify store,"Hi, I'm in the process of migrating my ecommerce store from another platform to Shopify (regular shopify, not [Shopify plus](http://www.shopify.com/plus)), and that entails migrating my Google Tag Manager (GTM), implementation to the new store. Shopify does not officially support GTM, so this entails some work and trial/error ... 

**Would anyone who has already done this be willing to share with me the script that runs on the Thank You page for the purpose of passing the Enhanced Ecommerce variables to the datalayer, thereby making the ecommerce data accessible to GTM?**

(This would be the script stored in the *Shopify Admin / Settings / Checkout / Order processing / Additional content &amp; scripts* field -- Not including your *GTM Container Snippet*, which I've found also needs to be stored in this field since the *theme.liquid* is not loaded on the Thank You page.)

Doubtless, many others have already implemented GTM with Enhanced Ecommerce on their Shopify stores, and this script should be essentially the same for any shopify store, so it would be really helpful if someone is willing to share it rather than me having to create it from scratch. 

As far as I can tell, the workarounds needed to implement GTM on Shopify are actually not as cumbersome as one might think. As far as I can tell, the necessary steps are as follows (with the steps I've already completed ~~struckthrough~~):

* ~~insert your *GTM Container Snippet* after the first body tag in the *theme.liquid* file~~;

* ~~insert your *GTM Container Snippet* in the *Additional content &amp; scripts* field that applies to the Thank You page~~;

* insert a script that translates the *Shopify Ecommerce Variables* into *Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce Variable* format and pushes them into the *datalayer* of the Thank You page; and

* where necessary, reconfigure your tag firing rules and the like in GTM to get your existing tags working properly on the new site.

As far as I can tell so far, that's about all that this should entail -- but we shall see what obstacles I encounter as I attempt to complete the implementation ... If anyone with more experience wants to comment on the accuracy of this plan, please don't hold back ... 
(I'll be happy to provide an update here once I'm done if if there's interest)

ecommerce,Shopify vs. Wordpress + WooCommerce,"Hi all,

I have been lurking for a while but have finally started to build my business. I'm currently pricing up products and talking to suppliers. I am also pricing up ecommerce sites to sell my goods on.

Its functionality will be straight forward and simple and its design needs to be professional. I want to offer all methods of payment - VISA, Debit, Credit, etc, and the site needs to be secure.

While pricing, the main sites I have been looking at are Shopify and Wordpress with the added WooCommerce plugin.

From what I have been able to make out Shopify works out at €59 a month, while Wordpress is €20 a month (€240 per year). On top of that WooCommerce is free and will provide me with what I need. Shopify also has a 1% transaction fee on the offer I am looking at while, as far as I can see, there are no transaction fees that accompany Wordpress.

Am I missing something here? Wordpress seems to be the obvious choice but I have seen Shopify praised quite a bit here. Is there big draw backs to using Wordpress and WooCommerce together that I am not seeing? Or are there any hidden costs, or costs I haven't taken into account?

Hi, I really want to know the specifics if possible. So if anyone is from Shopify or affiliated to them, it'll be really great if you can help.

In their page they stated three ways to earn through their Affiliate Program : Referral, Themes and Apps. Now I understand the last two but the Referral was a bit confusing.

Correct me if I'm wrong :

- You earn through referral by sending shopify customers/clients to build their business on their platform. Is this through links? If not then what way?

- Also, is this different from the partner program or just the same? Does this partner program applies to freelancers and agencies or through businesses as well. 

- And what does the 20% monthly revenue share means?

Many of our customers ask for it, but we just do not want to hold inventory since everything we sell is a deal, and comes and goes quickly. So taking in costs like that would raise our prices drastically.

We have though been doing drop ship of major online retailers, and we know we are fully capable of handling it on a smaller scale for our current loyal customers. But is it really worth it?

woocommerce,How to check if a product is in the cart?,"Hey guys,

I've been trying to figure this out for several days and I'm absolutely fascinated that nobody has apparently ever needed this functionality before. It seems like such a simple thing: I need to test if a post object is contained within the cart array.

Here is the code I have so far. This function is supposed to check if the cart contains both formats (Print and PDF) of a particular item (actually two entirely separate products). Then if both products are in the cart, the PDF should be discounted.

    add_action( 'woocommerce_before_calculate_totals', 'maslanka_charge_pdf_discount' );

    function maslanka_charge_pdf_discount( $cart_object ) {
        foreach ( $cart_object-&gt;cart_contents as $key =&gt; $value ) {
            $item_format = get_post_meta( $value['product_id'], 'wpcf-format', true );

            if ( $item_format == 2 ) {
                $pdf_price = get_post_meta( $value['product_id'], '_pdf_discount', true );
                $print_item = maslanka_get_print_from_pdf( $value['product_id'] );

                if ( in_array( $print_item, $cart_object-&gt;cart_contents ) ) {
                    $value['data']-&gt;price = $pdf_price;
                }
            }
        }
    }

The ""maslanka_get_print_from_pdf"" function just takes the PDF product's ID, then returns the relevant post object. It's returning the correct product.

Everything works except for the last part, where I attempt to check if the Print item is in the cart too. I'm really not sure how to put together this if statement in a way that will get it to do what I need. If someone here knows a little more about how the cart object works, maybe this won't be so difficult.

EDIT: Figured this out finally, although it may not be super elegant it's working for me.

If anyone else needs to do this, you can just create an array with each cart item's ID, then check to see if a given product's ID is contained in that array. Here's my working code:

    add_action( 'woocommerce_before_calculate_totals', 'maslanka_charge_pdf_discount' );

    function maslanka_charge_pdf_discount( $cart_object ) {
        $ids = array();

        foreach ( $cart_object-&gt;cart_contents as $key =&gt; $value ) {
            $item_format = get_post_meta( $value['product_id'], 'wpcf-format', true );
            $ids[] = $value['product_id']; 

            if ( $item_format == 2 ) {

                $pdf_price = get_post_meta( $value['product_id'], '_pdf_discount', true );

                $print_item = maslanka_get_print_from_pdf( $value['product_id'] );          

                if ( in_array( $print_item-&gt;ID, $ids ) ) {
                    $value['data']-&gt;price = $pdf_price;
                }
            }

ecommerce,Biometrics to Boost up M-Commerce Market,"Along with the widespread of e-commerce, m-commerce or trading on mobile is gaining prominence in the years ahead. Here are some mind-blowing figures about M-Commerce. Based on the Goldman Sachs report, worldwide consumers making purchases via mobile increases to $626 billion in 2018  from $204 billion in 2014. According to this report and the projected world population of United Nations, about 14.4% of the 7.56 billion people on earth will proceed at least one purchase on mobile by 2018. In another statistics of leading global e-retailers in 2014 ranked by mobile commerce sales, Amazon.com generated $16.8 billion in mobile commerce revenues, representing a 110 percent year-on-year growth, following by Apple with $14 billion and Jingdong Mall with $5.8 billion. However, this massive increase in the use of m-commerce has led to an increasing  threat of security. Users access mobile devices with certain limitation to avoid information theft or hacker, especially when it comes to mobile banking, which highly requires both security and convenience during the transaction.

According to the 2014 LexisNexis True Cost of Fraud Study, m-commerce fraud loss as a percent of revenue grew significantly in 2014, reached 1.36% from 0.8% in 2013 (see below chart). On a similar line, merchants are also experiencing increasing fraud costs this year at $334 every $100 of fraud from mobile payments.

Although complex password and PIN are offering a relatively sufficient level of security, they add inconveniences and cannot put the security to the highest. Moreover, according to the Internet Retailing magazine, 50% of online retailers said it is difficult to keep up with fraud methods and trends. In such cases, the identification of a person, based on physiological or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprint, iris, vein, hand geometry or voice, appears as an emerging solution that could provide both the highest convenience and highest security.

How biometrics would change the way of fraud prevention:
(1) Reduce fraud loss: biometric technology provides fast &amp; accurate identification process, hence, detecting fraudulent on their first attempt.
(2) Increase the revenue of online transactions: with the security and convenience that biometric authentication system provides, customers will enjoy fraud-free online transactions which resulted to a rapid upturn in the number of transactions and the revenue annually.
(3) Follow easily: with a simple mobile device integrated biometric scanner &amp; software, both customers and retailers can easily register &amp; start to purchase. The process will be a lot simpler for the 2nd buying time.
(4) Reduce fraud cost: with its advantages of convenience, security and fraud prevention effectiveness, biometric recognition is a long-term cost effective strategy with the potential to save billions of dollars per year of fraud costs.

In the next decade, biometrics M-Commerce is expected to reach mainstream adoption. As reported by Accenture survey, 71% of in-store shoppers are interested in paying by mobile phone but only 9% of retailers have mobile wallet capabilities. In another note, the coffee titan, Starbucks, reports that 15% of its in-store transactions in the U.S. are mobile payments even though users have to access and log in to its payment app. Apparently, the demand is there and is on a significant rise. According to the latest report from Acuity Market Intelligence published in 2015,  biometric mobile payments hit $33 billion in January 2015 and revenues generated by biometric mobile payments is forcasted to reach $33.3 billion by 2020. Biometric m-commerce with its security and convenience will not only enhance the customer experience but also push up e-commerce market.",0,1,2015-06-23,ECOM,0.05279751121997833,0.8990761637687683,0.04812636971473694

Initially, I was researching heavily on drop shipping, I read the guide by Andrew Youderian and as informative as it was, it was also intimidating as I'm new to the idea and I feel that a lot could go wrong.

I think my biggest issue so far is finding the right supplier, I've done numerous google search for various products just to experiment and its quite difficult to tell who is or isn't a true wholesale supplier.

Now on to my ecommerce business idea...Well, initially, I wanted to sell men's brand underwear targeting a specific audience (LGBT community).  But when I search for a supplier, the underwear weren't very appealing looking and not the brand names I had in mind.  Check out dailyjocks.com, that's the most similar thing I was going for but like I said, my issue lies in finding a product supplier :(

Another idea I have in mind is finding wholesale supppliers of ""flowering tea"", they're tea seed that blooms into a flower when you pour hot water, in case you didn't know.  

What do you guys think?  Am I just not looking hard enough for a supplier?  Any help and advice is appreciated.  Thanks.",5,2,2015-06-28,ECOM,0.03102855011820793,0.9223417639732361,0.04662963002920151

I launched my small ecommerce on Friday night, since then have had only 11 orders. Traffic is smaller than I'd like ..but I'm currently pressing hard on SEO, Marketing, branding, etc etc. 

I gained over 700 followers on Instagram prior to launch. I know it's really small. But I'm trying not to get discouraged on my first business at 21. 
So I would love to know what experiences in terms of how slow or fast business was in the beginning for you.

ecommerce,"Orders gotten a bit stagnant, any tips or pointers?","Hi guys, bit of background: we're a family business that specializes in import and export. Over the last 20 years we've also developed our own brand for spices and dry fruit which is wholesaling well in India.

I'm retailing the brand directly via ecommerce here in Hong Kong - so nobody in this market has heard of it before. Started last year, and gained some traction but the order rate has now flatlined a bit. We used to increase 20-50% month on month, but June and July have been nearly the same, and this last week has actually gone down compared to this time last month.

So I'm curious to see if there's anything wrong with the site fundamentally, or technically (we've added lot of new features in the last 1 month too!)

ecommerce,Site dictators insist on billing customers in pieces for their internet orders (Authorize X amount and capture Y if shipped in part until captured in full). Is this normal?,"As an online purchaser I am use to seeing my order for X amount pending for X amount on my bank statement until captured in full.

The powers that be for the website that I manage insist on setting up partial payments so that if for some reason the order doesn't ship completely the end-user pays for the part of the order that shipped and continues to pay in part until the order is fulfilled.

My thoughts are that the customer's bank has already promised to pay us the total amount authorized. We have 30 days to capture that payment. So, if we ship in part don't bother with capturing the part that shipped - we're going to get that anyway in the end and any confusing charges are just going to excite the customer.
