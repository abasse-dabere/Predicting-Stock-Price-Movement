ecommerce,Online Shopping vs Traditional Shopping,"Computers,Technology  &amp; Internet has changed literally every aspect of human life , no matter what the critics have to say this indeed is a welcome change since the primary objective is  to make every effort of man more simpler. As with every industry consumer retailing  too has evolved with time , here we are going to highlight certain merits of Online Shopping as against Traditional retailing ,  we are sure both these models are here to stay &amp; coexist. 

The primary benefit of internet is access to information , for shopping it means extensive data about product, brand,specification,comparison etc all at your finger tip to help you make a sensible purchase. The consumer also gets to know about a wide range of  products online, some of which you probably have never come across or even knew existed  , whereas  in a traditional retail scenario you were probably influenced by the representative to pick an item out of the 10-15 varieties  displayed to you. Impulsive &amp; Spontaneous buying is pretty common in conventional shopping , thanks to our  busy schedule ,at times shopping becomes more painful than a pleasurable event.

In Online shopping as there is no physical exertion &amp; activity, users can patiently browse through the product range without any pressure on his mind like getting back home early, weather, traffic etc. And rest assured a relaxed mind is always capable of making right choices.

Consumer Reviews gives an honest opinion about a product &amp; imagine you get  first hand reviews , the pros &amp; cons of a product from people located at diverse geographic location. This helps customers to be well informed &amp; knowledgeable about a certain product of his interest.  

In traditional retail a seasonal sale offer in Calcutta might not help a consumer in Bangalore, on the other hand Online  Customers  have access to all possible offers &amp; deals floated by different vendors irrespective of their place of operation.

In India , Online shopping comparatively is a newer concept. There will be more innovative methods going forward and with infinite  possibility of exploring newer methods , you can expect sea change in Online retailing , which ofcourse will be targeted towards creating more happy &amp; satisfied customers. Nevertheless the fierce Tug of war between Online &amp; traditional retailing would be interesting and maybe with innovative methods both can co-exist &amp; complement each other.

Happy Shopping.....

Like everyone, I am very excited and optimistic with my venture into the ecommerce space. I expect to make a billion dollars in the first month and retire to some private island somewhere by year's end. What could go wrong? Right? Guys?

In any case, I will not have a very large initial advertising budget. Basically whatever is left over after my initial inventory purchases. I want to employ a lot of finger-work in this, using a lot of social marketing, a lot of word of mouth, guerrilla warfare style tactics.

A lot of the bigger competition in my particular area don't seem to do a whole lot in the way of these types of marketing.

dropship,Blind Drop Ship + Paypal Adaptive Payments,"-------------
Background:
-------------

I have created a company that connects customers with producers. Customers would request an object to be made and the producer would receive the request, produce the item, and then ship to the consumer's address.

-------------
Problem:
-------------

We will be using Adaptive Chained Payments to hide the producer's financial information, but we also need to hide the producer's shipping address. To do this, we are trying to determine the feasibility of having a ""Blind Drop Ship"" where we (The Company) print out Shipping Labels (with The Company's return address) and email them to the producer. The producer would then apply the shipping label to the package and send to the consumer. Is this possible given Paypal's API?

As the title says, I'm trying to get hired in the e-commerce environment. Instead of directly sending my resume, I want to make an important person's head (at a startup) turn by sharing something valuable about their own business, which they don't know yet.
    
Ex, I targeted one such startup e-comm biz and made a slide deck (sent it over as well after breaking the ice on Twitter, will convert into a a phone call mostly) focusing on the UX and tactics for improving conversion. Some of the areas that I focused on were:    
-Improving site search (to consider mis-spellings, plurals)    
-Benefits of simplifying checkout process (backed by studies)    
-Opportunities for conversion via email marketing    
    
What do you think about this approach? What else do you think I could /should do to stand out from the crowd?

It is not enough for web based store locator pages to provide basic information like physical addresses of different businesses. The pages need to house more comprehensive information such as working hours, holidays, services, name of the business owner, contact numbers and other related information which can be of use to searchers. Usually, searchers look for this kind of information and a locations page to cater to this requirement.

ecommerce,Need help creating E-Commerce site,"Ok I need some serious help, I'm very inexperienced at web design and everything I've learnt so far (HTML and CSS) has been through my own research. 

I have been hired as an apprentice to create a ecommerce site, I went for a computing job as I had been training to become an IT Technician and somehow ended up with an interview as a Web design Apprentice. I feel I am quite creative so they asked me to design a poster, I did so and they were impressed and hired me. While I was at the interview, I did tell him that I had done hardly any web design and he was fine with that, as I could grow into the role and always be learning. (Please don't say ""It's impossible give up"", ""try another career you need experience"", I feel I can do it.)

Here is what he wants me to do:

Have a multi-channel selling software so it automates our stock to the webstore, Amazon and Ebay. Something like Linnworks would work right.

I have our domain name we would be using and all other relevant ones

I have the accounting software we are going to use.

I was thinking about using Magento to use as our platform or should I create it completely from scratch without using any platform?

What languages do I need to learn? 

What software would be best to use? (Photoshop, Dreamweaver etc.)

Anything else I should keep in mind?

ecommerce,"With multiple sites spread across multiple platforms, we're having a real problem with feed management. How are you handling it?","I've got about 50k products spread over about 15 sites on 3 different platforms (Order Dynamics, X-Cart, Magento). I need feeds for PPCs, CSEs, third party search, remarketing, etc... many of which require different, or at least variations, in the data within the feed. At the end of the day we're talking 100+ different feeds. And it's a mess. 

There are plenty of services that will claim to do feed management for specific services, but they're really talking about taking a raw master feed and just parsing it for the data that a specific service needs. Unfortunately, our problem is more like bad product or image URLs, bad or outdated pricing data, descriptions full of HTML, etc...

I feel like somehow I need to get this all managed in one master location, but this seems challenging working with three different platforms. 

I'm curious if others are having this problem and if there is a service or methodology you've found helpful in addressing it.",0.0,1,2013-04-17,ECOM,0.04836660251021385,0.9075508713722229,0.044082559645175934

dropship,I'm at a loss about finding a supplier.,"I'm just starting out and have determined a few options of categories of items to sell. However, I'm totally unsure about how to proceed. 

I live in an industrial city near LA and have lots of wholesalers, distributors, etc. right in my city. 

Is it a better choice to contact them, although their brands might not be well-known I feel comfortable because I can actually go and see them and know they are a legit wholesaler and not a middle man. 

Or is it better to search on a national level so I'm working with brands people might know?

ecommerce,Is it possible to sell a Magento template purchased from templatemonster to someone else? I bought one and never used it.,"A while back I was working with a couple of friends to try and put an e-commerce website together.  At that time we relied on a developer who had no prior experience with Magento but I was under the impression it was the right choice for what we needed and he assured me he'd be able to get it to do what we needed the site to do.  Well, his life kind of flaked out and in the mean time another guy on our team has been using WordPress a lot and is urging us to drop Magento and write off money spent on the template (as well as a Dimensional Shipping plugin; all this stuff I bought with money out of my pocket).

He's working on a prototype with this new WP e-commerce plugin to do a proof of concept and if he's successful then I'm willing to forget about Magento, but I would like to see if it's possible to sell what I've purchased to someone else who might get some use out of it.

I was thinking of adding small aluminum bottle openers or can coolers (all branded). I was also thinking stickers but these all seem to lack flare and personality. Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated!",11.0,8,2013-04-30,ECOM,0.015711070969700813,0.8249564170837402,0.1593324840068817
