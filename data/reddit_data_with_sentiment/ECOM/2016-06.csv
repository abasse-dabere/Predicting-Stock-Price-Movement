ecommerce,From a 9-5 to eCommerce Entrepreneurship: Where Do I Start?,"As a recent college grad I can no longer sit behind a desk and waste away my entrepreneurial passion. Its time I do something about it and would greatly appreciate advice from those who have already done it.


With all the information you can find online I feel there is still a high level of skepticism with most of the ""guru"" workshops and strategies. I would love to hear from real people, with real advice on how to get started. Its a loaded question but what are the most proven processes and systems I should create to get into the game. Should I follow a passion with regards to a niche? Also, what are the most profitable and sustainable channels to focus on for the future?

ecommerce,We just launched our Dry-Aged Steak business EU-wide. Come check out the site and help us become the best out there!,"Hi Reddit! 
We're SteakClub.eu, an online Dry-Aged Beef home delivery service, active in the European Union. We're based out of Poland. 
What motivated us to start our company was the lack of availability of good products on the home market, coupled with high prices. 
We launched last year locally (Warsaw, Poland), with a simple landing page, and we expanded to Krakow, Poland around november, and EU-wide 2 days ago. Our current 6 month plan is to organically grow our store, as well as expanding our product offering (we've currently sourced Bog Oak serving platters). Our one year goal is to have at least 200 return clients from 5 - 6 different EU countries. Our 5 year plan is become the equivalent of the American based Omaha Steaks in Europe. 

We are very keen on receiving any and all kinds of feedback about our webstore. We want to be the best, and won't settle for anything less. Check it out at www.steakclub.eu and rip us a new one :)

ecommerce,Alibaba and patents,"I have always wanted to do a massive spree of sourcing on alibaba, but since the Chinese don't seem to care about patents I can't do that. So if I want to source a product I search USPTO, but relying 100% on me not missing anything is a gamble. Hire a Professional lawyer? Feasible? The reason this isn't feasible for someone like me Is that, I'm just a guy living in my moms basement with little to no cash. I feel literally stupid to thousands of dollars on something like this, when I barely have money. 

My biggest fear by far is actually paying for a search, they find nothing, I start selling it and realizing nobody even wants to buy it... So I have to source some samples to see if it will sell before the search, but then I am risking infringement. Both ways, I'm screwed. I hate the system. Didn't know I was playing minesweeper

 Anybody else got any ideas? What happens if the lawyer misses the patent on the search? I get screwed for his mistake? I'm sure dozens of people are in my situation or just a mom and pop shop at home. These patents are such a huge barrier. Discuss? Shed Light? Advice?

ecommerce,Best way to accept large payment? Potential for scam?,"I run some ecommerce stores and just had an inquiry on a potentially big order. A guy inquired about over $10k in product and offered to pay freight as well. I tried processing his credit card but it didn't work. I want to offer other payment methods without leaving me vulnerable to a scam. I have talked with him multiple times on the phone so it doesn't feel like a scam but I can't be 100% certain. He wants me to use his own freight forwarder to get the large order from USA to Netherlands.

Would a bank wire be 100% safe for me? Any concerns you all would have with an inquiry like this?

ecommerce,Anybody have experience registering for an Extended Validation SSL Cert? Need some help,"Setting up a new e-commerce store (Woocommerce), and decided to go with the higher end EV SSL from Comodo which shows the company name in a green box by the URL.

The problem is, I just recently purchased the domain, which is the name I want in the green box.  I have a corporation already setup under a different name that I don't want to show, but currently it looks like that's the only way I'd pass the certification process to show the business is legit.

I'd love to register the new name as a DBA, but in Kansas it's not required and I can't find any way to register a DBA here that looks official.  I really don't want to setup a new corporation just for this purpose but I could if I have to.

My question is, can anybody think of a way to get the new name registered that would pass the certification process?  I'm planning to register it with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, but I'm not sure that will appease Comodo, especially since it will be brand new.

To anyone else with the same question, the 2.4x theme that we used had no compatibility issues with 2.5.5, and everything has transitioned without any issues into 2.6.1 over the past few days as well. Thank you /u/ahartzog for your input!

_______
Hello all,

We are looking to implement WooCommerce 2.5.5 into our WordPress Installation (WP 4.5.2) to replace OsCommerce, as OsCommerce simply does not suit our needs without extensive PHP Knowledge.

The reason I'm here is that we are obviously going to need to retheme to suit the installation of WooCommerce (Beside the fact that we're due for a facelift regardless), however the themes that we find appropriate all seem to declare compatibility with 2.4.x, none so far for 2.5.x. 

I've taken a look at the changelogs from 2.4.x to 2.5, and although it does not appear as if themes would be fully compatible between versions, am I wrong in this understanding? If not compatible, how extensive would the modifications to the theme be between versions? I have an okay understanding of HTML and CSS, but no Javascript knowledge and can only modify PHP files based on instruction at this time.

Any input would be greatly appreciated, as we are currently stuck with a sub-par WordPress Theme w/ embedded OsCommerce installation that was unfortunately paid for in advance, and we are beyond ready to move forward and expand into an eCommerce installation that would fully suit our needs.

I am a marketing and SEO professional who has a lot of success with online marketing for my company (I work inhouse). I've been doing this for over three years. I'm looking to increase my earnings entering an e-commerce store. I've read everything there is to know about it, have experience with all of this from work, and have all the theoretical stuff down, but I'm having trouble committing to a particular product or niche.

At work our vision is very clear and the company supplies the budget. I make profitable campaigns and have had a lot of success, despite me feeling confident on the know-how and management side of things and know how to rank organically... but I can't seem to get over the fear of investing my own money, picking a product, and running with it.

ecommerce,Is it impossible to start as a student?,"Hi guys, 

I am thinking of getting into ecommerce, possible dropshipping or standard inventory (buying). I see many people with the same skillset and money not being scared to start anything. When they start I see it goes well, but then I am thinking: why am I too scared to just start off?

 I want to know if ecommerce/webshops are still a viable field for income generation? I mean, I am not looking to replace  full time jobs. I just want to break-even (minimum) and then get some experience... Maybe a little bit profit to spend it on necessary things I need like maintanence of my car and paying for college costs etc..

I honestly don't have any ideas where to start. I just have â‚¬200-300 to spend and to start.. and have a couple of ideas but I don't know where to begin and if people will come.. If someone could help specifically with my idea (how to handle it, I like to receive any PM's)

Besides that I even don't know the best distributors for buying inventory/dropshipping to/within a country in West-Europe.

I liked AliBaba, but I read there is many scam and fake-products... So.. I don't want to be scammed. So I need a little bit of help.",14,8,2016-06-11,ECOM,0.03842926770448685,0.9254112839698792,0.03615947067737579

BUT, their businesses are totally different than mine.

I have technical skills to make a website, so I don't have to worry about buying themes or paying someone to make the site.

Only I'm awfully afraid to fail. That no one buys something or that 'fake bots that order so I just have money that goes away for nothing. In addition, you still have people order something and then return ... So here I am still too scared that .. because that will be costly.

-Start selling caps with own design through https://www.theprintful.com/

-Or selling T-shirts through https://www.theprintful.com/ ?

A couple of years ago, I started experimenting with creating an AI for creating art. Called it R. Piet because the style of choice was based on Piet Mondrian's. Eventually it was able to produce some pretty interesting pieces, and I've been toying with the idea of opening a store to sell some of those prints, as well as eventually take commissioned work by creating custom prints for customers.

So a couple weeks ago I asked R. Piet to create a couple of pieces and created the online shop. So if you guys could take a look at [www.rpiet.com](http://www.rpiet.com) and give me some feedback, it would be greatly appreciated! 

Also I had a carousel at the top with photos of how the prints looked like on different settings (rooms, offices etc), but I removed it since I had read carousels aren't very effective.

* A post which was more successful than mine, is this one which went to #1 on pics with thousands of upvotes: [""UPDATE: 8 Months Ago, Reddit Convinced me to quit my job and pursue my passion.

**Tips:**

* Post an imgur pic to your work
* They will delete posts that have a link within imgur
* They may [ghost](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ghost-banning-phenomenon/) your comment if it has a link to your shop or items, or a comment by you that says the word ""Google."" So when you answer a question in comments as to if you have an online shop, ask people to ""search"" for the name of your shop, or just direct message them. (Ghosting is making a comment invisible to everybody except for you, so log out to check if you were ghosted)

ecommerce,I'm in a logistics certification program. I need help with my project.,"Here is the situation:
This is a group currently working on a capstone project which involves designing an e-commerce solution for a fictional retailer of apparel and home electronics. The company has 800 retail locations, serviced by 20 distribution centers.

We already have the ERP, Inventory Management, storage and transportation side of the project down. I am currently investigating the retail website of of that E Commerce Solutions. In our project, we plan to on pitching an outsourcing option in which the company would hire an outside company to design their retail website. The store sells about 80,000 SKUs. Besides serving as a retail app, we would hope the app would also have light social media functionality.

I've reached out to a few design firms, which seem to quote me around 130k for the design and development of such a website. But that seems awful low to me still and for some reason, I just don't trust it. One more reliable quote I heard was that it'd be 50k for the website, and then about 800k for the product listings. so 850k. Is that sound?

And then we also have the hosting aspect of it. Right now, we're thinking about using Amazon Web Services to host the website and provide analytics services. If we were expecting monthly usage of 10 million customers, how much would that typically run?

On the mobile app side of things, I'm seeing about 2 million being thrown around a lot.

I know this is asking a lot, but these answer aren't easy to come by and I keep second guessing myself.

ecommerce,Multi Vendor eCommerce Platform,"Hey all. 

I'm wondering is there is any sort of eCommerce platform that allows people to signup and sell their items on your store.  I'm working on a project and am hitting a wall in this area.  

To better describe what I'm looking for, use the following example.  I run abc.com website which focuses on a very specific niche.  You, as someone who has developed a product within that niche, want to sell that product but currently there is no where to do so in mass.  So you find my company, that allows you to sign up and list your product.  in return, you get the profits and my company takes a portion of it.  

Is there any software available that does this?  Basically, I'm looking for an amazon.com style platform - however, it focuses on one specific product only and its not an auction - set prices determined by the developer.  The software must allow users to to create their own account, list their product, and determine their price, but it must also hold back a certain percentage of the profits for me in exchange for their listing.

shopify,"I think contacting customers about abandoned carts is worth it, here's what I've learned...","## Hello fellow small business owners!

Kara here, I'd like to share my experience with abandoned carts. My husband and I handcraft Secret Safe Books for a living. We opened on Etsy in 2009 and have been selling on them on our [Shopify shop](http://www.secretsafebooks.com/) since 2013. I admit, we've been somewhat lax in doing followup emails to shoppers who abandon carts, and I'm curious to know what those of you who get abandoned carts do?

**Here's what we did about our abandoned carts from 1/15 - 6/6:**

* 14 shoppers abandoned their carts
* 11 of 14 shoppers entered their email
* 7 shoppers we emailed friendly reminder they left a product in the cart plus incentive coupon code of 10% off 
* $410.66 was amount of product in the 7 abandoned carts we followed up on
* $105.03 recovered (2 returned and purchased what was in their cart using 10% off)
* Our customer service labor cost: Maybe 15 - 20 sec per email?

You can see what our Shopify abandoned checkout screen looks like [**here**](http://i.imgur.com/ivmyxwi.jpg).

Possible future experiments we might try:

* Send a dollar amount coupon code instead of %
* Send only reminder, not coupon code
* Send reminder earlier (we sent the reminders around 3 days after cart abandoned)
* Send reminder later

What do you do about abandoned carts?",6,3,2016-06-18,ECOM,0.0703616812825203,0.8920060992240906,0.03763224184513092

ecommerce,Confused on where to start (online marketing),"Hey everyone hows it going?

Need some advice regarding seo and marketing. I at 20 years old have owned and operated a small watersports store for 3 years with help of investors. In store business has been fantastic. However My website hasn't been doing great. My investors now want to start pushing heavy in to online, and start now so we can see some good returns over holiday period. being i am in a area with a short summer but a prime location for growing. Great! more then happy and will be re-designing my current website to clean it up. 

Issue is I'm having such a hard time trying to figure out google and all this stuff. Like idk where to start. Most of my online sales we solely from people finding my products on google shopping, even those were limited. As dumb as this gonna sound, if I can get 1-2 sales a day to start I will be happier (Start small and work up)

Seo has been limited as I'm kinda lost with it. And maybe you guys can answer a few questions or help me out? Im also balling on a budget so cheaper options for now will be life savers, As I cannot afford to hire someone to help out. because most want money upfront. I know about back links as I do have a very nice following on all social media accounts(more on this later).   

BUT

1. How many keywords and phrases is enough?
2. Should I have different key words for every product? 
3. My site doesn't show up with the ""www"" does that hurt how google crawls my site?
4. Facebook ad thoughts? 
5. Paid Ads on google?
6. Google webmaster tool tells me I have no links to my site, but with the backlinks I have a ton sites I interact with that should show up. 

Would it be beneficial to just hire someone and see if I can work out a % of sale deal?

Just looking for advice here, I know its broad but any tips would be appreciated!",6,5,2016-06-19,ECOM,0.036593757569789886,0.9296225309371948,0.033783722668886185

              I am from the island of Saint Lucia in the West Indies and I started this business to retail caribbean products online.

URL : www.shopdcaribbean.com

The idea behind the business is to promote products from the Caribbean Region and start pushing my region forward. This region has amazing products that just need the exposure.

I am looking for some advice for my website, products basically I am looking for honest opinions from my reddit family and also possible partners I can work with for distribution in other countries ( if possible) for these products on the website. I am hoping there are some entrepreneurs on here that would want to work with me.

Sales have been steady but as in everything the business can still strive for better.

We are also going to launch our Shop Saint Lucia Store at the end of this month where we will be adding some more products from Virgin coconut oil to Caribbean Rum Cake.

The Honest intention is to have products from all over the caribbean available in one central location on the web by the end of this year.

dropship,Can anyone give me some advice to get started? Warning: wall of text inside.,"Hey everyone, I have a few questions. Long story short, I'm currently out of work due to anxiety problems, and have some time to go before I even get in to see a doctor, and so I have a lot of time on my hands, and I'm stuck around the house not doing anything. I've been working on 3d models, learning programming, etc, but none of it's making money. Same with all of these apps I have like slidejoy and ipoll.  My girlfriend is keeping us afloat, and she's paying relatively cheap rent since we're living with her parents. But we're not saving anything, and I've got medical bills and a couple of grand in student loans left to pay off. I had heard of dropshipping before, and stumbled across someone talking about it on here yesterday which prompted me to learn more, and I'm very intrigued, but it's all so new to me that I want to make sure I have some things right, and to get some advice if anyone can offer it. 

As I understand it, I should get an LLC if I want to seriously do this, but it will suffice to get an EID as a sole proprietor(?) to start? After that, I don't even know where to start. I'd like to test the waters and start as small as possible, I'm not trying to hit the ground with a full-time operation. I guess I'm just wondering what the smallest investment I can make is and how, just to earn some money to save and invest back into it.

So here's our situation:

We have found a couple of sellers on Bangood with EU warehouses. We want to dropship from these sellers because the shipping times are good and we won't have to pay customs tax. We NEED to ship from the EU because otherwise there's just no way people would order from our store.

How does the VAT tax work within the EU? I've ordered products (as a private person, not a business) from the EU plenty of times and never been hit with a VAT tax or anything like that. Yet I keep reading about it... 

Can someone clarify how it all works out within the EU? I will buy and sell in the EU.",0,2,2016-06-20,ECOM,0.05125163495540619,0.9109546542167664,0.03779373690485954
ecommerce,Question - Calculating shipping cost?,"About to launch my Ecommerce store for my dealership, but the only thing I'm lacking is a solid formula for determining the shipping cost to the customer.

The distribution company where I'll be placing my drop ship orders from does not include weight with the product descriptions I've been given.  The weight isn't calculated until the product has actually been shipped.  My dealership is responsible for paying for shipping, but since I have no idea how much the product will weigh, I don't know what to charge the customer up front for shipping. 

Going back and charging the customer once he's already paid and after the product ships (so I'll know what to charge again) seems like it could get too sticky, plus it's MUCH more work on my end. 

It seems the most logical way to charge the customer up front for shipping is to calculate the shipping by price. For example: orders ranging from $0-15 will be charged $5 shipping. $15-30 will be charged $10 shipping. $30-60 charged $12.50 for shipping and so forth (just a rough estimate, don't know what the price tiers will be yet). 

Are the any other ways to do this? I would put an estimated weight on each products with an individualized shipping cost, but we're selling thousands of products, so that's out of the question.

ecommerce,What eCommerce platform has a brigher future? PrestaShop or WooCommerce?,"So I am working my first PrestaShop store (have been building eCommerce websites for 10 years, though).

Im almost done with the store, but Im a little taken back by how much issue I have had importing products via CSV.  Once they are all in the store, I now have to assign each product to their category that I manually created.  I have over 500+ products, and I am finding there is no way to do this in bulk.  I basically have to open each product manually and assign it to a category individually?  

Anyways point being whenever I have an issue or roadblock with PrestaShop, it has been difficult getting answers.  The PrestaShop forum is dead, and responses are vague and take days and weeks to reply.  I come from ProductCart where I can open a support ticket and get a response within hours, but ProductCart is closing down so I am forced to venture into other areas.

I keep hearing about WooCommerce, and being a WordPress developer and designer it seems like it may be a good fit for me.  But now I am so far deep into this PrestaShop project I am hesitant to start over with WooCommerce.  

However I am thinking I may be able to get 'caught up' with the new site in WooCommerce if it is as easy to use as it claims to be.

But my biggest concern is learning a platform that will take me well into the future.  I now know ProductCart, for example, inside and out - but it is closing shop.  I want to invest my time and learning into a platform that has a promising future.  

Should I finish out the PrestaShop job, or start investing in WooCommerce?  It appears WC is on the up and up, but Im not sure.

My other concern with WooCommerce is that it appears to be geared to a selling-out-your-garage type store, as oppose to a store that can be used by a company that makes its living selling online products.  Is this true, or no?

Edit: Only self-hosted (no Shopify, BC, etc).  No Magento either...Magento took 5 years off of my life trying to learn it and launch a website with it.

ecommerce,What are the real alternatives to Mailchimp,"So,

we have 11k subscribers using an outdated local vendor for sending our e-mails. It's time to upgrade and while I have experience with Mailchimp, I'm curious what the alternatives out there. In terms of features:

Database: Over the next months, we need to start enriching our database with order information, enriched profiles etc. 

Segmentation: Data with segmentation is boring. We need to be able segment our database in various lists depending on the objective.

Automation: We need the ability set up automated programs, e.g. resending a campaign if it wasn't opened, rating and review mails, 

Analytics: I love data. I want data. And I need to be able export data.

Forms: Next to my shity mail vendor, our website vendor sucks as well. The e-mail provider needs to have abilities to have various sign up pages, edit profiles pages etc. 

I look at a few, but I got the feeling in the end they don't differ much.

* It looks like there is so much more learning tutorials for WP

I do not know code, yet I do know how to use Joomla!  Everything I have read suggest WP is even easier so I don't think the learning curve would be a problem.

I've been toying around with the thought of opening a small shop on Amazon - just as a means to tip my toes into the water and maybe make a few bucks on the side.

I've worked for an ecommerce business dealing on Amz before, so I know the value of customer- and after-sales-services. However, that business was a completely different scale.

ecommerce,Merchant center and foreign currency.,"Hi all,

Currently I have a shopify store and some of my traffic comes through Google shopping. 

Now I'm selling to the U.S. And my prices are in $US. I want to start selling to the Canadian market and I believe the rule is that I will have to quote my prices on the site in Canadian dollars. 

Quoting in Canadian shouldn't be a problem. There are several apps on shopify that will convert from USD to CAD. 

The problem is that it converts at the current exchange rate from the base USD rate to the Canadian so prices will change daily. Therefore the price will constantly change and will not match what the advertised price is on google shopping. 

Is there some way that I can handle this? I mean there must be lots of people who want to sell to multiple countries through Google shopping so must be a strategy to deal with it?

shopify,Shopify with Magento features comparison,"Hi all.

this is a cross-post (similar one posted in Magento reddit), but I have good excuse for that in this situation.

Our clients and prospects often ask about the differences between Magento and Shopify. There are lots of high-level comparisons around, but I couldn't find anything very detailed, down to specific features.

So I decided to build my own and made a quite extensive feature comparison list of Magento vs Shopify.

It is available as Google Spreadsheet at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OQYtfTHKy7T0UzT-y9xmOTVRLV17Zd2gvQumb2MqckI/edit#gid=1241163601)

What I thought next is that this comparison may benefit from input of other people, because with all my best efforts, I may miss something or did something wrong. Nobody is perfect.

Hence I made this spreadsheet open for edits, and encourage everybody to contribute.

Otherwise you are just welcome to use it when make decision what platform to use or advise your clients on that.

P.S.  I admit that the comparison is a bit Magento-centric, Magento features list was taken as a starting point and I know this platform better.",8,4,2016-06-28,ECOM,0.026734568178653717,0.9287824630737305,0.04448302462697029
ecommerce,O2C conversion / integration with a Shopify store?,I need some help! My friend owns a company and just hired a 3rd party payment processor. They arent on shopifys processor list so right now we are using paypal for CC transactions and we have the option to use the new cc processors Virtual Terminal on their site. The folks at the processing company haven't been too helpful and although they initially said it cold be integrated with Shopify they are now saying they dont have the time or means to integrate. The last thing they said was that I had to use the API to make a small module if I didnt want to use O2C. I dont know how to do that and i dont know where to  start. Any info would be helpful! I might have to hire someone from reddit or upwork to do it which isnt a problem. Thanks guys!!,5,4,2016-06-28,ECOM,0.022553643211722374,0.8919894695281982,0.08545684814453125

ecommerce,Someone in Mexico keeps ordering stuff and I'm starting to get suspicious... (x-post /r/Shopify),"Hey guys, just wanted your opinion on this.

I run a small online video game Shopify store and don't get a whole lot of orders. A few weeks ago someone from Mexico ordered a game. (Note, he paid $20 shipping for one game...) Cool, ok. Then a few days later he ordered another thing. And then another. He's just made his 5th order and none of the items have even arrived to him yet.

I'm using Brain Tree to process the transaction. I'm thinking that when he gets them he's going to do a charge back or something and I'll lose everything. Am I protected? Should I contact Brain Tree?

Thanks!

*Edit* Thank you guys so much for all your advice. It's such a weird situation - the card CVV is correct and the billing address matches the shipping address. He claims he's just a big nerd who wants all these games. Maybe he's loaded and likes paying a lot for shipping? Either way, I told him that I'm not going to ship him any more items until the other packages get to him. That way, at least, there will be a month or so between each transaction.

ecommerce,Help! Need advice. I feel stuck.,"Ok,

A bit of a personal back story here. For the past 10 years I have been telecommuting for a American company, I am a US citizen, while moving around the world every 2-3 years for my ex-wife's job. Currently I am in Kiev, Ukraine. While here I lost my job due to lay-offs and got divorced. I have 2 small kids with her. 

Now, due to her having primary custody, if I want to see my kids I have to follow her around the world when she moves every 2-3 years for her job. The issue is I now need a online job, or any job, that I can move around the world with so I can be with my kids. I have been researching drop shipping and affiliate marketing along with a few other ideas but I can't seem to past the research step and onto implementations. I just seem stuck. I have been a corporate guy for 15 years in the field of Requisition, PO Management &amp; Reconciliation Analyst mostly in the IT Finance sector. 

So I am desperate to find something I can build and grow that will allow to be with my kids. If anyone has advice or direct me to a well established business or process, there seems to be so many sites promoting themselves they are the one, I would be very grateful.
