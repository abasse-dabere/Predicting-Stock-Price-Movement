shopify,AHH! Pulling my hair out with the shopping cart.,"I am almost ready to launch my new site and I have been testing out ""checking out"" with items.

We sell fabrics, so it is really important for our customers to see how many yards of each color we have in stock. This just seems like it should be an automatic thing, no?

woocommerce,Create categories from attributes?,"Hello. Pretty new to Woo and I've just built a site that imports all my product from a different marketplace that charges me 8% on sales (but has a ton of traffic). I obviously need to improve my SEO and usability and I'd like to create some categories to help with that. I have over 4000 items that have ""style"" attributes and I'd like to create some kind of code/plugin/shortcode that allows me to add current and all future products to a category based on their attributes.

It's a music site so... 
if style = ""house"", ""techno"", ""deep house"", ""electro""... add to category ""dance music""
if style  = ""reggae"", ""african"", or ""calypso"" add to category ""international""
if style = ""ambient"", ""experimental"", ""abstract"" add to category ""home listening""

Such that if the style of a record = House, Techno, Ambient it will be added to both the ""dance music"" and ""home listening"" categories.

I can't do anything that involves editing individual pages because there are 4000 of them and I add approx 25-50 new products per day.

Thanks for any assistance!

edit&gt; I made this [products attribute=""styles"" terms=""house, deep house, tech house, acid house, garage house, tribal house, beatdown"" columns=""5"" limit=""100"" orderby=""date"" order=""DSC""] that puts all the ""House"" based attributes on one page.

I have recently been thinking about a small business where I was thinking of providing some services such connecting users in need of some service to the providers and charge either side a commission fee. 
So the most straightforward way to do that was to use the stripe. But a few things has made me concerned:
1. say someone perhaps from outside US pays, receives the service and then disputes the charge? Or something similar to like that. Now, Can a customer disputes the charge in the first place?
 and if yes what will happen then? How can I prove that he received the service? 

2. What if someone hacks my website, can he does any banking stuff if he can access my host? 

3. What is the worst case scenario that can happen? What are the critical things that I need to know, before I take any actions?

shopify,Make Sure You Actual Know Your Store Functions As You Think or Want It To...,"I look, on average, at dozens of Shopify stores on any given workday.  It is astonishing how many stores are not built right or just built poorly in terms of presentation to the customer and for ease of use for the customer.  

Here are some typical issues:
The store has a bunch of annoying pop-up apps asking the customer to do something such as signing up for something, enter a contest, or answer a question.  These activities are important to you the store owner but if implemented in an annoying way will produce the exact opposite results you are looking for.

Typo's and poor grammar.  A quick way to lose credibility with the customer.

Wrong information is given:  Emails are displayed incorrectly, links are broken such as social media links.  The frustrates customers to no end.

Incomplete contact information is given.  If you are a real store and business is there a reason you don't give a phone number, address, business hours, etc. on the contact us page?  Also, realize if you give an email link where clicking on it initiates outlook to start on the customer's computer, delays and something not working on that particular customer's computer will cause that customer frustration.  It's not your fault (you don't own their computer) but the customer will blame you.

Is your product sold cheaper somewhere else than your own webstore? Ensure this isn't the case or at least know about it.  A great way to lose customer's loyalty is to sell them something they could have bought cheaper somewhere else.  They will remember that.

I could go on.  Take a few minutes and go through every aspect of your store and just confirm your presentation is what you think it is.  You went to all the time and effort to build the store.  It's critical that work is checked for quality.",8,10.0,2017-11-03,ECOM,0.19098466634750366,0.787224292755127,0.021791022270917892

ecommerce,I Just Reviewed over 200 Shopify Stores. Here are Notes...,"I am posting this to help people with common set up issues that, if not fixed, will keep your store at the mom and pop level. For a living, I help grow Shopify stores. The following observations I offer for free because the stuff you should be paying people like me for is for marketing services to build traffic and sales and not fixing obvious but common mistakes :) So here are my informal survey results:

**Contact Information**

How come there is no contact page? 

How come there is no business address or phone number? 

Is this a real business? How come you won’t give directions on how to get to your business?

How come on the “contact us” page has no contact form? This form is automated by Shopify and so easy to set up. Select page.contact when setting up the page. Or, on the contact us page, there’s a contact form but there’s no text that states “we want to hear your thoughts” spiel, no email address, no phone number, nothing…. it’s just a contact form. That’s so not professional or even polite.

Why is your email contact address a Gmail or Yahoo account? Seems fishy that your email is not the same as the domain itself.

It would seem that a lot of store owners don’t run their online enterprise the same as they would run a brick-and-mortar store. If you ran a brick-and-mortar store would you hide mailing address to that store? If you have a brick-and-mortar store would you hide the phone number to the store? Or directions to the store location?


**Social Media**

Social media links are broken or don’t work. Why would I buy from an e-commerce site that doesn’t work? It like going to a restaurant where the chief can’t cook or the auto mechanic can’t fix cars.

Why on the Facebook page don't you have an email contact address?

**Presentation**

The text font is either too lite or too small or of some weird shape. All of which makes it all hard to read. Why are so many stores having a grey colored text on a white background? You are purposefully making the customer strain to read about you and your goods.

Why is there pop up after pop up on the landing page? It’s annoying. One pop up is fine but multiple pop-ups on the landing page truly distract the customer from actually making a purchase. How do you know these pop-ups are doing something positive?

Why are so many menus are confusing? Menus should be as simple and of few words as possible. Make collections of your products so it's easy to find such as price ranges, colors, sizes, etc. Collections work great on Landing pages. Use them. Don’t show 500 products… Customers don’t have the patience.

The store presentation should not be an art project. If you want to know what I mean just look at Amazon‘s page. Or Nordstrom’s. Or REI’s. It needs to be simple, easy and quick-to-checkout-to-use, with quality images and error-free text. Apparently proofreading is not a high priority for a lot of store owners.

How is it possible in this day and age that you could have a website that is not responsive to different size screens or devices? Again, this is an automated function on Shopify. Why is the store stuck in the 1990’s?

**Finally,**

All of the above issues lead to a break in trust from a potential customer. That’s why the customer will leave your site and go to a more trustworthy site, probably Amazon or the like, and ultimately not make a purchase from you. Are you aware that 84% of all US online consumers check Amazon before making a purchase?

Anyway, maybe I'm venting. Hopefully, this will help. Remember all of the above will not increase traffic ... but it will help reduce chasing customers away.

**Addendum - Free Shipping**

Online retailing reality is that free shipping has become the norm.  Consumers see shipping charges as a slap in the face.  Not having free shipping (at the very at some dollar value) is a disadvantage.  Now every business has different finances but there has to be a way to (1) absorb the shipping costs to get the sale, or (2) adjust the item price to account for the shipping costs.  It's my experience that most store owners failing to address this issue simply do not understand the economics of their business.  There are always exceptions to the rule but for the majority of consumer products free shipping of some form is a must.",36,48.0,2017-11-04,ECOM,0.037803489714860916,0.9326257705688477,0.029570775106549263

ecommerce,"15 months in, 3 site redesigns, LOTS of partner building... am I ready to push instead of build?","Hey all -

First and foremost - thank you for even clicking. We all have karma points... please let me cash some of mine out and ask for 15 minutes of your time.

I founded [AxeandHammer.co](https://axeandhammer.co/) more than a year ago. It began organically... I'm a photographer and people were asking for prints, so I figured other photographers have their own customers that would love high-quality prints of their work, as well.

I (and a partner I brought on) developed a site (Squarespace), scrapped it. Developed another (Shopify), scrapped half of it. Developed our current (Shopify + template). Then, we switched to trying our hardest to recruit good photographers to join our list. It's been a ride, let me tell you.

All the while, we haven't really ""pushed"" our product. We haven't run any ads, or PPC, or any major PR. We've just been heads down on develop, design, recruit. 

Now, I'm finally comfortable with our brand and our product. But I have a lousy feeling in my stomach that we're going to keep digging and find out later something is inherently wrong with our foundation.

**My big concerns:**

* Do we do a decent job of indicating that this is a desirable, authentic product? Especially in comparison to the cheap sites out there that sell prints (Society6, Fine Art America, etc.)

* Are our prices reasonable, but within a range that makes the customer understand that this is a high-quality product? Our margins are NOT big... trust me... and most of them go back to the photographers. This isn't an Alibaba business. 

* Is the whole thing cohesive? Do you, as a first-time browser, feel comfortable looking at the shop and the brand, or does it scream ""kid in basement creates Shopify account, hard stop""?

ecommerce,Seeking advice to sell security supplies online,"I work for a small business selling security supplies (e.g., burglar alarms, fire alarms) at a city storefront with little to no web presence. The owners have 100+ products that they would like to sell online but aren't sure of the best platform to do so on. They aren't looking to open an ecommerce store necessarily, as they are looking to liquidate these products rather than restocking them and maintaining an online presence. We are considering eBay, but through my personal experience selling items through the site, eBay tends to side with the buyer over the seller, which has been a headache in the past. Ideally, we would like to use a platform that is free, provides an easy payment gateway (credit cards, maybe PayPal, etc.), has a good search presence, and is supportive to sellers for returns, payment issues, etc.

shopify,Brand credibility vs cheap sales tricks,"Hi guys
I have no doubt that artificially creating urgency and scarcity, free + shipping offers etc. can increase conversions in the short term, however my goal is to build a solid, credible, trustworthy brand image as I think in the long run it makes you more money as you might get loyal customers, have a better reputation and also should be able to offer your products at a higher price. Therefore my question is: How do you find the right balance between these tricks and keeping a high brand credibility/giving a sense of luxury? I think there is nothing wrong in putting some items on sale and running social media campaigns saying ""only this weekend 20% off on all shirts"" for example, upsell/cross sell bundles are ok too I suppose. I am unsure about countdown timers, in stock counting buttons and these ""John just bought x item"" pop ups. All other sorts of pop ups jumping out of nowhere, free + shipping offers etc. do not help in establishing an exclusive brand image imho.

shopify,What’s the truth with Geek Hoodies?,"So I was looking at the Shopify exchange site and just browsing at high price stores available for sale. Despite how “ why I’m selling” was spun, most shared a similar pattern, Store peaked then declined and owner is trying to cash out. But what really struck me was Geek Hoodies, I remember seeing their assassins creed hoody adverts all over the place. The store went from making $1m a month revenue to now making a loss of $300 all in the space of a year and the decline was like driving off a cliff. 

So I researched and the first thing I noticed was dozens of daily negative reviews on Trusted Pilot, went onto YouTube and saw that many influencers had made videos denouncing the hoodies, emphasising the crap like all things “made in a Chinese factory” part, (imaging the horror today when they find out where there  £999 iphone x was made).

So I was just wondering are Geek Hoodies genuinely a very bad company that sold a poor quality product and offered shit customer service that deserved to go bust or did they fall victim to some kind of take down? Cos why would youtubers start posting vids about a £10 hoody ?

Update: Having watched a few more youtube videos, from smaller less strategic channels,  I’m certain that while the product was definitely crap, the motive for influencers taking up the cause was because Geek Hoodies were making over million in revenue a month.",1,2.0,2017-11-04,ECOM,0.5468857288360596,0.43237870931625366,0.02073552832007408

shopify,Changing Currency To USD,"Hello,

I just opened up a drop shipping Shopify store and recently made my first couple of sales. I just realized that my site is in CAD yet the products I am outsourcing are in USD. I unknowingly set the prices of my products accordingly to the USD prices. When converted to CAD there is barely any if any profit at all. 
I am wondering, is there a way I can update the prices of all my products so that they display the original price but in USD. This may be confusing so here's an example: I set the price of a bottle of cologne at $45 CAD but I want the price to actually be $45 USD as the actual product costs me $33 USD.
I know I can deactivate Shopify payments, however, at the moment I do not want to set up payments through a third party. I know I could manually change the price via bulk edit, however, exchange rates are so dynamic and constantly changing that that won't be an effective approach.
I've been looking online a lot on how to solve this but can't seem to find an answer.

ecommerce,Ecommerce Software Advice for a Nonprofit,"Hoping that your collective knowledge can point us in the right direction. I'm working with a nonprofit that gives free children's items (clothes, toys, etc) to needy children through a network of social workers. 

Currently we are using Americommerce/SparkPay as an online ""store"" so the social workers can place orders and specify things like size, color preferences etc. Everything is free, payments and shipping are shut off. Volunteers then us this data to manually fill the orders. We don't keep inventory. All items are hand-selected from the piles of donated items we have.  We need to replace this system with something else and we can't figure out what would work. 

The ideal system would have the social workers list the children served by each order along with their age, gender,etc. before selecting items from the ""store."" Then the kids' names would appear as a variant on each item in the store. So the social workers can then tell us which child the item is for as they are selecting it. It also allows us to sort the packing slip by child which makes filling the order easier. 

Know of any ecommerce software that would do this? 
Maybe order processing software? 
Is there another system that would do this? 

Thanks so much for any advice you can offer!

So far have had a little bit of success with views but no sales (outside of face to face) and I'm guessing it is a site issue - (leaving after average is about 23 seconds) and I was wondering if it would be a good idea to take down the email capture and if anyone has any suggestions at all that may be able to be done to improve the site?

Would be satisfied with just enough sales to cover the (low) costs and a learning experience. If anyone has any advice or constructive critique would be much appreciated!

dropship,The ABCs of Dropshipping,"The purpose of this post:

Most of this subreddit is the same thing, over and over again. People asking for help and feedback with their stores. That's fine, I get it - it's hard to find a way to get some honest opinions without spending money, and sometimes you need a second pair of eyes to see the flaws in things.

With that in mind, most of these feedback posts have the same questions and problems, over and over again. To save myself (and you) some time in answering the question that's been asked a hundred times before, I'm going to use this as a ""frequent points"" post that I can refer back to. I welcome discussion on these points, but in general, these are my rules and laws when it comes to marketing anything.

**My frame of reference.** I'm not a guru, a youtube personality or an ""advertising extraordinaire."" I don't have a 12-step program, and I don't have a method to take your money, even if you wanted to pay me. If I ever recommend something, I won't ever provide a link, referral or otherwise - I'm not associated with any companies. I've worked as a digital marketer for a year, and as a content writer for a year before that. Of that year, six months of it was spent working for a large dropshipping firm, the biggest website for which was nationalparksdepot.us.

Long story short, I know my stuff by watching other people make mistakes. I lost my job at that ecommerce firm because the entire office was laid off, because my boss needed to do the things I'm about to list and didn't. I'm a little surprised that the website is still running, and haven't given it the satisfaction of anything more than a cursory visit since I was laid off.

In short, my boss faced the problems you all are going to face, so here are the solutions.

**Folly #1: No Niche, No Store + Finding Your Niche.**

If your store is your baby, the niche is the zygote. The zygote being a fertilized egg. If you don't know who you're selling to, you have absolutely no hope of ever selling anything. And the best way to know who you're selling to is to find your niche.

And let me be clear: selling baby supplies is not a niche. Selling bowling gear, selling camping equipment, selling watches... these are all *things.* They're *what* you're selling. You need to find the *who.*

So you're selling camping equipment. Are you selling camping equipment to college students, looking for a weekend at Tahoe? Are you selling them to hardcore survivalists, hiking across the Canadian frontier? Are you selling them to middle-aged families, looking to spend a weekend in a campground?

Then break it down further. Are those middle aged families tent camping, backpacking, or using a trailer? Do they own an RV? Are they going 10 miles, or 100? Are they a little bit city-minded, and the type to want running water, or are they more OK with the idea of a camp toilet and bathing in a river?

Is the purchase decision made by a man, or a woman? How many kids do they have, of what gender? Is this their first trip, or their 30th?

Unless you know *everything* about your target market, nobody is going to pay *any* attention to you, your brand, your advertising, or your store. Essentially, think of a crowded room. You and sixteen other people are shouting ""hey everyone!"" and being totally ignored. Instead you shout ""hey, Greg!"" And three people turn towards you. But it doesn't work if there's no Gregs in the room. That room is Facebook. Your shouting is your ad.

And as for finding a niche, that's the easy part. Look to your hobbies, to your work place, to your family and friends' habits and hobbies, and find the markets that enable them. Find a desire or need (more on that in a minute) that you can service. And put a spin on it.

**Folly #2: No Desire, No Need, No Sale.**

Sales 101: The only way you'll ever sell a product is by finding a need, or manipulating a desire. Seriously, go talk to a *good* salesman in a furniture store, jewelry outlet, car dealership, or go look at online advertising - *all* marketing is built around this principle. The conversation is always ""What can I do for you?"" 

Dropshipping is no different. You've got your niche, so figure out what itch you want to scratch, what need you're servicing. Failing that, you don't have a business - you don't even have an idea.

**Folly #3: One product, one page.**

So you have your niche, and hopefully, you've got a good idea of what you want to do for them. That's the first step. Congratulations! You're now leagues ahead of 99% of people who post on this sub. 

Your niche also means literally nothing if you continue following the steps that you're encouraged to.

This is the most obvious thing I see virtually *everyone* do wrong when it comes to dropshipping. You've got your niche (or not), so now it's time to find 15 products that *might* be of interest to that niche, write some mediocre copy, create an average-looking store, and run some ads, right? It's that easy! **NOT.**

Shopify is built to sell a hundred or more products, which is literally the opposite of what you need to do as a dropshipper. Trying to compete with Wal-Mart, Cabelas', or Amazon *doesn't work.* You just wont do it - not only do they have the brand, they have the prices and the selection.

As a dropshipper, the *only* way you will ever find success is by going the opposite direction - taking a single product and spinning a funnel around it (more on that in a moment).

Imagine you own a restaurant, which is widely regarded as the most difficult entry-level business to open. You know who you want to serve - hungry college kids that are looking for a quick bite between classes - but don't know what they want to eat. First, bad. You should know what college kids want to eat - burritos, pizza, hamburgers, coffee - fast foods that can be taken on the go.

But either way, you just kind of serve everything. Your menu consists of pizza, steak, all manner of mexican food, off-brand coffee, and 30 other items that nobody will ever eat.

As a result, you don't specialize. Your food is mediocre at best, nobody really knows your store for any one particular menu item, and you don't do very well. 

*OR,* you have *excellent* burritos, and everyone comes to *only buy burritos*. So why have the rest of the menu, then? Pour your heart and soul into making the best damn burritos possible, and spend your marketing budget *advertising burritos.* You're either left with a mediocre restaurant that nobody wants to eat at, in which case, you need to find something to be great at, or you're left with a huge menu that you're wasting money on, when people only just want one thing.

Either way, *specialization is success.* You don't need 15 different products - you need one product that sells. If you don't know what that product is, the only thing to do is try until you find success. That success will be 100x more powerful than any mediocre trickle of sales you get from 20 products - and if you do have a store that has 20 products that sell, you're probably mostly selling *two or three products.* So just ditch the rest.

And when it comes time to market, build your site around that product. Build your page around that one product. Your reviews, your ads, your branding - all around that one thing. All you need is a landing page and an order form - that's it.

**Folly #4: Funnels Are Your Friend.**

Here's another common mistake I see. You've got your niche, your need, your product, and you've started your store, and now you're selling $35 *whatevers* and nobody's buying. Why? Because unless you're selling a $35 roll of toilet paper in a crowded, out-of-TP bathroom, nobody is going to whip out their wallet and give you their hard-earned cash. This isn't wal-mart, where you're guaranteed the lowest prices. It's not cabela's, where you're guaranteed quality products. It's not Amazon, where you have the entire stock of the internet at your fingertips and a decent review score to boot. You're just some guy.

There are exactly two ways to earn business as a dropshipper - trust, and incentives. A funnel achieves both of these things.

So here's what a funnel is:

A funnel is a marketing technique - a chain of offers which increase in value over time, targeting repeat customers in a wide necked, narrow stem approach to sales. In short, it's named after a literal funnel. You attract the MOST customers with the top of the funnel - the wide bit - with a very cheap offer that is appealing to anyone. If you're selling camping gear, you offer a free flashlight. If you're selling baby supplies, you offer free diapers. If you're selling automotive equipment, you offer a free steering wheel cover.

Then you move up the funnel. That free flashlight came with a card in it - it has your brand, and a 25% off coupon for a tent, or a free $5 credit on any item worth 20$ or more. The diapers came with an offer for a *whole pack* at a discount. The steering wheel cover came with an offer from a nationwide tire chain - get your wheels checked for free. Anything to keep the customer coming back.

Then with that larger purchase, you opt for even larger. That 20$ tent turns into a 40$ backpack. The pack of diapers turns into a monthly subscription. The wheel check turns into a tuneup or a set of rims. Each time, you're incentivizing the purchase. You're making the customer feel valued. You're getting brand interaction. You're *building trust.*

A repeat customer is always more valuable than a new one. They're warm traffic - not only do you not have to pay for advertising, but they're more likely to buy, as well. Any way you can utilize them, that's money in your pocket. And if you don't, you're probably just not going to make very many sales. The days of being able to sell 50$ items with Facebook ads are virtually gone - and especially so for dropshippers. This is your second option.

**Folly #5: Branding Buys Business.**

No brand? No association, no interest, no business. You need a brand to succeed, and that's *more than a name and aesthetic.*

What can you tell me about Subway? Well, they had their 5$ footlong. They had Jared. They have their daily offers. They *used to be* a good brand.

What about Papa Johns? Well, you probably immediately think of the owner of the franchise, whose face is burned into your brain. The dude's made himself the indispensible face of his marketing. He's very honest and friendly and family-oriented, like a Mitt Romney that owns a pizza chain. He has public opinions on the NFL controversey, Trump, and the quality of food he expects from any of his stores. Good branding. More importantly, what would Papa Johns be without him?

What about McDonalds? Ronald McDonald. The HamBurgler. The big golden arches. The dollar menu. Bud-ah-bup-bup-baaah. How do you describe McDonalds without any of those things?

Or Harry Potter? The scar, the snitch, the Hogwarts towers, the wands.

Star Wars? Lightsabers, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, Stormtroopers, Clones, Droids, the Millennium Falcon.

This is what ""branding"" means. Something unique. Something distinct. Something *worth mentioning.* And yep, it's work to get a good brand going. But a good brand is the difference between revenue and profit.

**Folly #6: Attention, Not Distraction.**

So you've got a brand. You've got a funnel, a solid product, a desire that needs catered to, and a perfect niche. And you're *still* not getting sales.

First, congrats. This is a pretty advanced issue, and one that I've literally never seen posted on here, but I know exists.

Typically, this issue is as simple as fixing a headline.

Did you know that the Enquirer is one of the most read papers in the US? Maybe not by copies sold, but on headlines alone, it's easily the most read. Everyone who visits a supermarket reads the Enquirer headline. And it doesn't use misleading information or clickbait titles. It doesn't force you to read it, it doesn't make you wait to watch your video, and it sure doesn't use **FUCKING POPUP ADVERTISEMENTS.**

It just puts something so interesting and so outrageous on the cover that you *can't help* but engage with it. And that's what you need to do with your marketing. You don't need to be outrageous, but you do need to resonate. Copywriting is the art of taking a need or desire, and putting it on display in such a way that it's powerful enough to not just attract attention, but to *stop* people from what they're doing in order to have it read. That's not shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater. It's not an overbearing sales technique. It's not mugging your customer with ads. It's yelling ""food!"" to a famished crowd.

**Folly #7: Advertising is expensive. Get over it.**

Still not making money? You're probably not spending enough. Anyone who works in advertising will tell you there's a minimum barrier to entry to Facebook. You're going to need to spend 1-200$ on ads, *minimum* before you'll begin to see what your typical results will look like. That's just how the platform works - algorythms need time to optimize. Your market needs time to see your advertisements. Your website needs time to show itself off. 20$ a day, over 5 days, and you've got a solid ad budget.

1-200$ will buy you a couple hundred clicks, and a few dozen sales. Don't worry about making a profit straight off - there's optimization to do. But anything less than that, and you're trying to tell a wallpaper in a dark room. Wetting a desert with a glass of water. You can't tell what's going on with your site by spending 20$, it just isn't enough. Sorry!

**Folly #8: 200% profits are a myth.**

OK, this one's a peeve. You are a dropshipper. You exist on margins. The gurus out there that tell you to pick a product from Aliexpress, mark it up to 4x the price, and resell it to make millions **are lying to you.** Here are the problems that you will face when you blow up your prices to ridiculous amounts, in the interest of making more than they're worth.

* Lack of conversions, because you're charging above the market price.
* Customer support nightmares, because people are expecting something better than what you're giving them.
* Quality concerns, because you're charging name-brand prices for knockoff equipment.
* Competition undercuts, because it can be done cheaper and you aren't doing it.
* And more!

There is no such thing as a free lunch, and dropshipping is a logistics avenue, not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're selling things at wildly inflated prices, even if you find success, it *will* come back to haunt you. All it takes is a few too many product defects, a few too many shipping delays, a sudden drop in conversions, a competitor taking notice, and suddenly, you're losing money. Lots of it.

Don't be greedy. Don't treat your customers like fools. They'll treat you like a predator, and nobody wants that.

So that's all. Ask questions and I'll answer if I can. Or want to.",3,5.0,2017-11-09,ECOM,0.09788760729134083,0.8736378997564316,0.028474494349211454

ecommerce,Pricing Strategies to Succeed with Amazon,"Whilst Amazon is not all about the lowest priced item you certainly need a pricing strategy.  It’s one of the most common questions we get asked, ‘how can we compete with these prices’ there’s a few things to remember:

Sometimes a merchant particularly will sell an item for less than the trade price.  Strange and as alien as that sounds to me you must remember the days of loss leaders, and whilst Amazon can afford short term losses for long term gains by pricing everybody else out the niche, it’s not something we can all afford to do.

Some merchants will not understand the full costs involved in selling on a platform like Amazon and sell items too cheaply.

If using a repricer, if you are not careful and set up a breakeven price you can find you’re losing money on every sale, without even noticing.

Finally you will have merchants that just want to clear stock and turn it into liquid money.

I currently have my site built with Wordpress + Woocommerce and it is honestly so time consuming and slightly complicated to setup that I never really did it. Its been depressing me and I was tired of sending people to halfway made site so I now have it forwarded to my Etsy page.

I REALLY want to get off Etsy though, and get my site off the ground. Do you feel the monthly cost of Shopify is justified? I'm really not a fan of subscription based services and that is a big part of what turned me off them in the first place.

I've also seen that a lot of add ons are paid too, for those who use these are there any that are truly worth the price?

Stripe - dropshipping prohibited
checkout.com - can't unless &gt;10k per month
authorize.net, 2checkout, PAYMILL - need to give a ""physical"" proof of our business, which I don't have since I'm only dropshipping

ecommerce,E-commerce solution,"I'm currently a undergraduate student enrolled in a university that combines the degree with a co-op program. Through this, I've been able to pick up decent full stack knowledge. 

So now that I'm done with a little background on myself, I've currently been tasked by a family friend in order to create a website in which he can sell a very small amount of products (2-3). He'd like the website to come out fairly quickly so right out of the bat I have removed creating it from scratch from my possibilities as dealing with authentication, security, certificates seems too far fetched for a task like this. As a result, I've been looking into possible E-commerce solutions and have practically narrowed my options down to Shopify or WooCommerce (if you feel something else would be suitable for this please feel free to recommend it). 

However, as I am being paid to do this, I feel as though letting them know they would have to pay for the Shopify account monthly fee as well as a transaction fee seems kind of crazy. On the other hand there's WooCommerce however I see a lot that there are issues with security when dealing with outdated plugins and I would rather not have to be constantly updating them. 

Would you guys suggest Shopify over WooCommerce for this project or perhaps a different e-commerce solution?

woocommerce,Shipping problems,"Quick question. I got a small online retail site and for some of our shipping cost for certain products it is not calculating correctly. We are supposedly pulling our rates live with FedEx. But the problem is:

For Product A it figures out the shipping cost for one item, let’s say $9 (which is correct). But if the customer orders more than one of Product A then it just multiplies the $9 times the quantity. So if they order 10 items of Product A it will calculate to $90. Which is incorrect. It will all go into one box and we be closer to $15. The problem I think is the system is assuming that we are going to ship each product in an individual box, which is not what we would do. 

However, for other products on our site this is not happening. It is calculating the $15. For this I am assuming it is calculating the new box size for the increase quantity then figuring out that shipping cost as if it were all in one box. 

So is there something in our woocommerce settings that is causing this for certain products but not for others? Any help would be great appreciated. Thanks",4,4.0,2017-11-15,ECOM,0.0671830028295517,0.8965041041374207,0.03631284832954407

ecommerce,Need a new platform,"I currently am using Shopify and Magento for my business.

I'm looking for a platform that can 2 specific things on top of the normal shop stuff that everything does.

1. I create manual orders (shopify - draft orders) for large customers that email me a PO, that they can then pay when the order ships
2. I need to be able to track multiple partial shipments on an order, and would love to be able to do this on an unpaid order (like shopify draft order, can't fulfill until its an actual order)
edit: 3. I need to be able to assign tiered wholesale pricing, so wholesale customers can log in and purchase at their price, need this to be a discount based on $ and not %

My biggest issue is on large unpaid orders, I haven't found a platform that I can do fulfillments on it while its in unpaid status, which means we have to print the draft and keep notes on paper, and that is starting to cause issues.

edit: i've seen some stuff about the shopify api that lets you mess with financial status, but I don't seem to see that anywhere on the shop back end in orders. I could possibly just mark these drafts as paid, if I can somehow manage the financial status to track unpaid stuff, and process payments outside of the system when ready.

ecommerce,How to use Google analytics effectively?,"Google Analytics is by far the best analytical platform out there, but, to me at least, it was very hard getting started and to figure out how to use the platform correctly.

I was new in the game and just got hired by a company, but when I got introduced to Google Analytics I had a hard time imagining that I would ever figure this out on my own. If it wasn't for the help of my coworker, then I would have spent hours and hours to find my way to understanding the platform. 

I got a lot of help by reading articles and especially an article by Moz helped me getting some kind of insight. It is called the [absolute beginner's guide](https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics) and is great inspiration for people new to the platform. 

Nowadays, when I have become a lot more experienced in the use of Google Analytics I am striving to get the most out of the platform and try to follow new trends that can help me an e-commerce ""first mover"". Because every business uses Google Analytics. 
In fact, I read somewhere that 59 percent of the top 10k sites on the Internet are using Google Analytics. This is an indication of how you should be creative and in the game to be outmatching your competitors. 

My request to you dear Redditors is, therefore: Do you have any tips or tricks for Google Analytics? Or do you have an article you use as inspiration that you mind sharing?

ecommerce,WooCommerce vs Prestashop from a pure PHP dev angle and performance angle,"I have been testing both WooCommerce and Prestashop over the last couple of days and I have coded a custom modules for both systems.

It took me literally five minutes to get my module up and running with WooCommerce while I spend an hour and a half trying to get the same functionality added to Prestashop.

The main problem with Prestashop was a horrible lack of documentation for the 1.7 version and only by locating code examples on StackOverflow did I manage to get it done.

However, Prestashop seems more ""professional"" than WooCommerce. The code is cleaner, but also much more slow and heavy due mainly to the extended usage of classes from the Symfony framework. But the overall system ""feels"" more professional.

WooCommerce is very easy to ""hack"" with custom code, but I am not sure it's the right solution.

What are your **bad** experiences with each system? Yes, I am mainly interested in the bad stuff to avoid.

How well does each system perform on heavy load with a huge database?

Any sharing of experience would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards.

**Update**

I decided to do some testing using Apache Tools and Prestashop is incredible slow even with cache (file or mem) enabled with huge amounts of failed requests.

It is actually so bad that I would never consider using it.

WooCommerce has no failed requests and with active cache performs amazing.",3,2.0,2017-11-18,ECOM,0.10298901796340942,0.8600062727928162,0.03700467571616173

ecommerce,Picking your brain on eComm,"Hi everyone, new to reddit but have been poking around for a few weeks. Have a scenario that i'm facing and am hoping to get some insight from other redditors. I'm starting an ecommerce store (its my 5th) All the other ones ive done in the past have been purely dropshipping. I feel like this isnt the direction I want to head in so i've saved some capital and finally doing it the ""right"" way. I sourced a manufacturer in china that I met at the canton fair this fall for a certain line of mens accessories and placed my first small order. I've now received this small sample batch of products but in the time I was waiting for it to arrive from china, i've decided on a whole new look I want for my line. They will essentially look the same but with an added unique touch that i'm hoping with the right marketing, i'll be able to stand out compared to the other sites out there. My question is, since the site isn't launched yet and getting these ""custom"" products made may take months, is it a good idea to start with what I already got? It's close enough to my vision but isn't what I want to run with. I figured, doing this would help me salvage some of my initial investment (not much $600ish) but i'm worried this could damage my brand image. Is this a correct way of thinking, or since it's still in the infancy, I can get away with pivoting to the ""new"" line of products a few months down the road once I go through the entire process? Essentially, should I take the loss and wait for the new products or should I start with what I have and transition once I get them? 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I've done fairly well with dropshipping but this is my first shot at white-labelling products and working with the manufacturers directly.

(2) Can I use my personal bank account instead business account? (3) I know I can use my Social Security Number and report income. What I am confusing is.... Do I need to set my tax account first? Or After my business open? If I have no income, I don't have to report? (4) Is it legal to use pictures from Ali express for my shopify store?

ecommerce,Is there a digital download e-commerce solution for audio files?,"As the title reads, I'm looking to sell digital downloads. Specifically, audio files. The issue is, everything I've searched for charges a monthly sub fee. This is ideal for people or businesses that have an established identity or following on the internet. I'd much rather prefer a service that takes a percentage from each sale instead. 

 &amp;nbsp;

It's going to take time to grow my channel initially, so going negative from the jump does not make sense for my business. Any 'free' service I've managed to find is limited to how many files you can upload before you have to pick a subscription plan. Being capped at 5-10 files blows because I have about 30 ready to go.


 &amp;nbsp;


What I'm ultimately looking for: 

- Cart-system capable of sending immediate digital file delivery to customer after purchase.

- Audio Player / Cart Widget that I can copy and paste onto website.

- Advanced options like having certain sale items, discount codes, etc.

- Revenue / Payment split option between two individuals.

Just discovered this subreddit, and I think it's amazing!

I finally got my first few dropshipping sales (still haven't broken even, but still a milestone), and with Black Friday/Cyber Monday coming up, I want to try to kill it this weekend. 

I'm primarily using Facebook Ads to drive the sales, and I was wondering if anyone wanted to share what's been working for them with ad copy, targeting, and conversion events. 

Here's what I've been doing so far to test new ideas. 

Example product: cat toys
Ad set Budget: $5 for each one. If they're profitable I spend more. 
Targeting: Interests: people who have liked cat food pages
Ad copy: something like this: 
[
Pre Black Friday Sale! 
Do you love cats? Then you'll love this!
Click here: [shortened URL]
Don't Forget to Tag a Fellow Cat Lover!
]
Links directly to product page. I've been using the ""add to cart"" function because I've heard it works better in the beginning until Facebook's algorithm works. Not sure really, though. 

Anyway I hope people will share what they've learned from facebook, especially the targeting.

I own an automotive shop in NJ that specializes in German cars (Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche.) Currently we have a Wordpress site and use Woocommerce, but I want to switch to a platform that caters more for automotive search and will scale well as our online business grows.

ecommerce,Chargebacks for international forwarding,"I’ve received an online order via Shopify Payments, which shows no concerns about the processing. The card billing address, CVV, and IP from the order placement all line up and make sense. However, the shipping address goes to a different place - to a consulate to a South American country.

I contacted the purchaser by phone and messenger who said they are starting a business in the country (they’re credibly from there) and moving there soon, and their consulate will be forwarding the freight from me to them. This isn’t a normal service I can locate on the consulate website, but I could imagine they may be willing to help in the case of someone starting a business down there. The customer has address history etc as they’ve apparently lived in the US for some years now. I believe she used a BoA debit card (though the details provided to me via Shopify Payments is minimal other than it passed the cursory fraud detection alerts. She’s offered to send via “Zelle” but at this point I’m not sure there’s really a point since her card billed successfully through my merchant account. She doesn’t use PayPal and I don’t think I’d get seller protection anyway since she can’t exactly “confirm” a shipping address at her country’s consulate.

Other than the billing and shipping address discrepancy, there’s not really any obvious red flags here, I’m just incredibly wary of international sales and freight forwarding and I’m a small business and it would be a tremendous blow to get screwed on this order. Are there some steps I should take beyond signature-on-delivery to protect myself? Is it likely the delivery to the consulate can go poof due to sovereignity claims and the person having moved out of the country in the meantime cause me to have no recourse? I don’t know how how thoroughly I can insulate myself from losing a chargeback case if this turns out to be some kind of scam.",6,4.0,2017-11-25,ECOM,0.03791020065546036,0.9316424131393433,0.030447369441390038

It seems that all of our visitors will look at the products, and then leave shortly after. Not a single visitor has attempted to buy anything either.

I believe that part of the problem is the fact that we don't have any images/videos of the products being used. We asked the supplier for some images, but she said they did not have any, because they are apparently still looking for a photographer. 

We did create a holiday advertisement for facebook ads with a budget of 5$ for 3 days (it's all we could afford) Admittedly, the discount we offered (10% off) wasn't a great deal, but we would have not made any money if it was higher than 10 percent.

I haven't worked on the SEO for the website, because most articles I have read said that SEO was an outdated method that does not work anymore.

I can't keep giving shopify 30$ a month to run a website that is failing to make a profit. We have thought about shutting down the store at the end of december, due to the fact that we are basically throwing away money.

What should we do?

ecommerce,Complete Rundown of My 7 Month Old E-Commerce Store - Need Help/Advice Please!,"Hi there,

My name is Michael and I started an e-commerce business (TeaParky.com) in April 2017 that sells loose leaf tea and Matcha with a portion of sales being donated to fight against Parkinson’s Disease. I just wanted to document my journey so far in hopes that others are able to learn from it or provide advise!

Why I Started The Company?

When I was the age of 10-11, my father was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, and has had the disease for a bit over 15 years. It’s been largely a struggle having grown up with a parent and watching my dad slowly lose his ability to move and talk, but at the same time it’s helped me develop empathy and a perspective on life that I would otherwise not have. As a result, I’ve been looking for ways to turn this unfortunate break into the biggest blessing of my life. Having a strong interest in business, I decided that starting a business to raise funds/awareness for the disease with the way I was going to do it.

While I was looking into different ways I could start a business with very little capital and not much risk, I came across an article called 72 hour dropshipping business, in which a Shopify team was given the challenge of creating a dropshipping e-commerce store in 72 hours and turning a profit. If you have yet to read the article and are interested in dropshipping, I highly recommend Googling it as it provides specific step by step instructions on how they did it. The product they chose was Matcha, a product I was highly unfamiliar with and had never tried before. After reading the article, I was convinced that an e-commerce dropshipping was how I was going to do this. I also decided I needed to try Matcha, and although I didn’t like it too much myself, I figured the blue print was there and the health benefits were fantastic and that I could market it as an alternative to coffee. As a result, I decided to launch my business to sell Matcha! (More on this later on, as you’ll notice if you go to my site TeaParky.com, Matcha isn’t front and center anymore)

The name Tea Parky was very easy to create. I wanted the flexibility to expand into other products in the tea space other than Matcha, and I wanted Parkinson’s to have some type of influence on the name. “Parky” allowed for that as it isn’t blatently obvious that there’s a connection to Parkinson’s Disease and can be associated with parks and trees and nature, which is a great image when thinking about tea. I originally wanted to name it Parky Tea, but the domain name ParkyTea.com was unavailable, so I had to reverse the name.

 

The Process of Finding a Supplier, Creating a Logo, Website, Etc

After deciding I was going to start an e-commerce dropshipping business that sells Matcha, the next step was trying to find a dropship supplier who would do private labelling as well so that I could put my logo on the product. I decided the easiest way to do this was to go through Google and type in “Matcha dropshipper”. After scrolling through about 10 pages of Google and emailing every potential lead, I came across a company called 3-Teas (3-Teas.com). It is run by a lady named Lesley, and I had seen her name and company pop up across many of the links I had opened up, with her commenting in various Shopify forum discussions of people looking for a tea dropshipper/supplier. I absolutely appreciated her hustle and decided to reach out to her for samples and pricing. After sorting all of it out, I decided to go with her as my supplier. I haven’t had an issue since and she is very courteous, accommodating to all of my little needs and quirks. She has no idea I am writing this nor am I receiving anything for this, but I highly recommend her as your tea/matcha dropshipper if you are looking for one.

While I was emailing and waiting for responses/samples to arrive in the mail, I took the time to think of how I wanted to design my logo and where I was going to start my e-commerce store. The e-commerce store was essentially a no-brainer, as the 72 hour dropship business article used Shopify and it seemed like a very common and user friendly platform.

With regards to my logo, I initially tried to create one in Microsoft word, and had used it when I first launched and in my first couple of sales. However, I was starting to notice that the quality and definition of my logo wasn’t up to par when it was printed out onto packaging, and realized that I needed to have a more professional looking logo. I decided that spending a bit of money on a logo was definitely necessary as it would be the first image potential customers see, and I couldn’t cheap out on it. I ended up spending 40 dollars on Fiverr.com to get a logo I was very happy with. If you’re looking for logos, there are many people on Fiverr who are willing to design tens of logos until you are 100% happy with it.

With regards to the packaging, that was not something I had to worry about as Lesley took care of the whole thing. The only thing I needed to do was provide her a label of a certain size. That part was easy as I went to Microsoft word and designed my own label.

 

My First 10 Sales

After finding a dropshipper and creating my website, I was now ready to sell! I had absolutely no idea how I was going to get the word out and read numerous posts and blogs on how to market (more on this in the segment below). In fact, shopify has a regular e-newsletter they send out and one of them was titled something like 50 ways to get your first sale. A number of them included reaching out to friends and family, so that is exactly what I did. My first sale ended up being from my cousin, and slowly afterwards many more sales trickled in from friends and family. My first 10 sales were all from friends and family. It’s pretty humbling to think about the support I’ve received since starting the business from those closest to me. We often take these people for granted, and this has definitely helped me learn to appreciate them more.

 

Advertising Growing Pains And Current Marketing Strategy

After the initial boost from sales to friends and family, I needed to figure out a way to gain traffic and sales from random people. There were many, many suggestions I had read about, from Meet-Ups to FB advertising/Instagram influencers to increasing SEO to social media accounts, etc. Below are some of the things I have tried since opening up my store in April 2017:

Facebook/Instagram Advertising – I tried to sprinkle just a little bit of money into Facebook/Instagram advertising, targeting an older audience who had interests related to matcha, tea, and Parkinson’s Disease. While I found it was a little effective in creating clicks and traffic to my site, I didn’t find much success in producing sales. In total to date, I have tried 7 campaigns for a total of $50 and 1 sale. A lack of sales could totally be the result of me not spending enough money and going 100% in, but at the same time, I thought it would be too much of a risk given my low budget and lack of capital.

Instagram Influencers – I’m a huge follower of Gary Vaynerchuk (if you don’t know who he is, please do yourself a favour and look him up. It will change your life), and he talks a lot about Instagram influencers being the most undervalued commodity in advertising and marketing right now. I decided to give it a try and reached out to a couple foodie accounts with roughly 5-10K followers. Both did an Instagram story and a post about the baking/cooking they did with the Matcha. Usually, Instagram influencers cost a bit of money to post, but given the cause of my company, all I had to do was provide them with a sample. This led to 2 sales and was much more effective than the $50 I spend on FB/Instagram advertising (how I track these sales was to offer them a unique promo code they can send out to their followers). However, it also takes a lot more time building connections and reaching out in Instagram DMs. I guess it would make sense that more effort = more effectiveness.

Bloggers – I took the exact same approach as Instagram Influencers with bloggers. Reached out to a ton of food blogs, told my story, offered a sample and asked them to post about it. I was able to get 3 blogs to post about it, but ultimately it led to 0 sales. 2 of the 3 blogs didn’t even ask for a sample, so the cost of this was next to 0.

Running my own social media accounts – I currently run an Instagram account (@TeaParky) and a Facebook account (@TeaParky). I use most of my resources on the Instagram account and the Facebook account is simply a repost of all my Instagram posts, which is a major no-no but at the same time, I currently just don’t have the time to make unique posts for Facebook. I’ve found that these accounts have given me a lot more exposure and I use it to interact with other accounts out there. While I can’t exactly calculate the amount of sales I have generated as a result of my social media interactions, I can safely say this has helped significantly. My Instagram account is at 1,500 followers and it has been a blast to constantly come up with creative new material. I do this thing called #DoesMatchaGoWithEverything where I put a spoon of matcha into different things from alcohol to chips to sriracha and consume it! Those videos generally create the most engagement and are a blast to do.

Reaching out to Parkinson’s organizations – This has turned out being one of my most effective marketing techniques. A portion of all sales are donated to 3 separate groups: Michael J Fox Foundation, Parkinson Society British Columbia (PSBC), and Rock Steady Boxing (RSB). After presenting these organizations with a first cheque for all the sales that have come in since launching, PSBC and RSB were gracious enough to feature me in their e-newsletters and social media. In fact, I currently have a story profile on the PSBC website. 

This has helped me connect with so many people currently affected by Parkinson’s Disease, some of who have made a purchase. This is honestly the best part of starting my business so far. It’s so cool to hear from others who are currently going through the same thing to know that we’re not alone, and truly inspires me to push hard on this project and make this a success. If someone diagnosed with an incurable disease can wake up everyday determined to fight like hell, what excuse do I have to be lazy?

 

At the end of the day, I’ve found that if you’re able to provide people value without expecting much in return and do that as many times as possible at the lowest possible cost, that is how you create the beginnings of a successful business. Since starting my company in April, I have no broken even given the significant costs of incorporation the Shopify plan, marketing and handing out free samples, but I believe in providing as much value as possible and hopefully someday that will correlate to success. And if it doesn’t, I’d like to think the loss in funds was worth the ability to provide so many people with value, especially the hundreds of interactions I have with people who have Parkinson’s or have been affected by Parkinson’s on Instagram. After all, I am currently writing this blog hoping I can help out others in my position learn from my mistakes without asking for anything in return.

 

Biggest Mistake and Pivot

Having launched my company on a product I had never tried before and didn’t know too much about was a mistake that I fought with for 6 months. I constantly told myself that it wasn’t the product but rather the cause and my story that would help me become successful and generate sales. While this was the case, I found that it led to a lot of one time purchases, and very rarely did I get repeat customers. This was because customers were purchasing to support the cause, not because they enjoyed the product. Also, matcha is a very novel product that many people have never tried before, and the price point is way too high for people to take a risk on something they’ve never tried. In addition, matcha is an acquired taste and many people find it extremely bitter. Needless to say, in hindsight it wasn’t very smart to start my business selling matcha and that I should have made the pivot to loose leaf teas much sooner than I did. However, just like in life, we often tend to cling to a mistake because we’re too stubborn or scared to admit it, and are afraid of the change that needs to happen once we admit the mistake. This leads us to turn small mistakes into large ones as we spend more time digging ourselves deeper into the hole. I read an article that said that successful people are the ones who aren’t afraid to admit a mistake early, and use it to pivot to something better. Mistakes and pivots are necessary to the path to success.

I shouldn’t have started my company selling a product I wasn’t familiar with and didn’t consume myself. As a result, I made the pivot to loose leaf teas. 5 flavours to be specific (oolong, peppermint, green, earl grey, orange pekoe). These flavours were decided upon through a contest in which we asked for suggestions in exchange for the teas to be named after them. If you go on the website (TeaParky.com), you will notice that every loose leaf tea is named after someone. This has also become a bit of a marketing effort as it not only helped me select flavours that my potential customers would be interested in, but also create a personal attachment for 5 individuals and my products.

This decision to admit my mistake and pivot has been one of the most important decisions of my business so far, and I am very happy about it. It’s hard enough creating a successful business as it is, let alone constantly wondering if the product you selected was the right one. I still currently sell Matcha on my website, but it is not as heavily promoted as before. I have since then started to evaluate all aspects of my life with the same approach and tried to admit mistakes and pivot before I dug myself into the ground even further.

 

How I Found My Loose Leaf Tea Supplier And All My Supplies

First thing I did was reach out to Lesley at 3-Teas.com (my current dropshipper for matcha) to ask her if she dropshipped loose leaf teas. Luckily for me, she had an array of teas that she could also dropship. However, given the low price of loose leaf teas that bigger companies such as David’s Tea had, the dropshipping method didn’t make sense from a financial perspective. Also, I was starting to find that things such as delivery of samples became very costly due to the fact that I was being charged the same fee everytime by my supplier. If I was able to control everything myself, I would be able to decrease my costs and increase my ability to market more and hand out free samples. After all, nothing sells the brand quite like a taste of the product.

As a result, I decided that I was going to try to package and ship out the loose leaf tea myself. To do this, I would need a bulk supplier, my own packaging, labels, etc. I was able to purchase bags, labels, and a heat press off of Amazon for a very good price, and realized that if I was able to condense my packaging enough, I would not be charged the parcel rate for shipping. This would significantly decrease my costs and allow me to compete with the bigger tea companies who have e-commerce stores. I was able to find multiple bulk tea suppliers who would allow for their tea to be repackaged and rebranded and ultimately decided upon one that I was most happy with. Currently, I am weighing the loose leaf tea and packaging the bags at home. It obviously takes a lot more time and effort than dropshipping, but the cost savings and flexibility are more than worth it. I have kept my current dropshipper for matcha because she has been absolutely incredibly supportive throughout the process and I would love to keep that relationship going.

Currently, David’s tea charges around $8 for 50g of tea. However, their shipping costs are very high depending on where it is being shipped to. As a result, the total cost of the tea after shipping is included is actually the same as my tea, which is presented at a higher cost because my shipping costs are lower. I haven’t quite figured out a way around this as I feel as though the David’s Tea method is trying to trick the customer by putting the majority of the amount on at checkout (I’ve tried to put teas like Earl Grey in my cart for $5 dollars only to find my shipping was another $9 at checkout). Whereas, I would like to be honest with the customer upfront, although this may turn them off when they see the initial price.

 

Future Aspirations

I understand that Rome wasn’t built in a day and I have long term aspirations for this business. Patience is a word that I try to preach in everything I do. I would like to try to expand into local tea/coffee shops and see what kind of traction I can get this upcoming year. This process has been very fun for me to pursue and I love the challenge of trying to start my own company, with only $1,000 of capital no less! If you are on the fence about starting a business, I can tell you even if you lose the small investment that you put in, the people you meet and the things you learn will make the process more than worth it and open up other doors for you that you didn’t know existed. Just recently, I was brought up to make a cheque presentation and speech in the middle of a wrestling ring in a shopping mall! Never in my wildest dreams…

I currently run an eBay shop that sells Pokemon cards. I'm interested in expanding to Shopify and Etsy to avoid fees, expand my customer base, as well as refer eBay buyers back to my Shopify website. My goal in researching this was to do the following:

-Import all my eBay listings to Shopify

-Going forward, use Shopify as my base

-Utilize an app or software to sync listings on Shopify, eBay, and Etsy and push orders to Shopify for easy shipping


So far the choices seem to be the following:

-Codisto LINQ

-inkFrog

-esaPRODUCTMANAGER

-eBay app on Shopify (the reviews look awful)

-SynCommerce

ecommerce,I recently abandoned the concept of using AliExpress to drop-ship cheap trinkets and rebuilt my store (MackSupply.com). Whaddya think?,"Over the summer I fell for the hype of building an AliExpress-based drop-shipping business. Most of the items we advertised were *FREE + shipping*. The model failed because ad costs **far** exceeded costs per acquisition. It also failed because most people abandoned their carts upon discovering delivery - though free - might take three weeks. Nothing against AliExpress/Alibaba if you're buying in bulk; but for a dropshipping business, I find it difficult to justify the costs and wait times.

To improve the store, I scraped AliExpress entirely and found a handful of reputable US-based suppliers and applied to become a distributor for them. My company still drop-ships a lot of items, but delivery times are as quick as next-day, and margins are far and away better.

I am ecstatic about the hometown orders but this seems a bit too coincidental to be legit in my mind. 

Am I being overly cautious or should I wait to ship until they payout to my bank acct?",6,4.0,2017-11-29,ECOM,0.04972396045923233,0.9140402674674988,0.03623584285378456
ecommerce,Best ecommerce service for selling small scale,"Hi, I was wondering if I could get some advice on the best ecommerce service for a small scale selling operation.

I sell about 5-10 products a week, but have a large inventory. I currently use PayPal buttons, but it's kind of cumbersome creating a new web page and button for each product, and I'd like to expand to selling a variety of products with different shipping prices, and also have the opportunity to offers coupons or discounts, something which is either impossible or a lot more difficult using only PayPal buttons.

I've considered Shopify, but I'm not sure if that's the best option or not. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks for the time!",13,3.0,2017-11-29,ECOM,0.02068718709051609,0.9225809574127197,0.056731849908828735

ecommerce,Can Someone Review My B2B Trade Intelligence Station? Anything Particular You Want to Read that I Missed?,"Hello all, I just startup a trade intelligence station via wordpress last week. I’d like to share my experience and problem here… Maybe more like complain.

The original purpose to establish this station is to gather useful industry information, reviews, reports of trading as well as B2B e-commerce solutions for audience. However, I found it’s not easy to search valuable articles and insights especially when it comes to coal, steel, chemical, mineral…those industries. I mean, it needs years of practical industry or trading experience to judge whether this author is saying buxxshxt or not. Thus, I really worried about the quality of the articles on my site. Feel free to visit my site and leave your feedback:[check my site ](https://insights.jumoreglobal.com/)

Please tell me anything important if you think I missed.

Maybe you will ask why you choose a disadvantaged topic for my site? Actually, cross-border e-commerce trade is a hot topic around world, many online marketplaces have started online cross-border trading of consumer goods, food…etc, but few of them are focusing on coal, steel, chemical, mineral… So I deem there are huge business opportunities of my site if more and more people will move the traditional sales channel of commodities to online.

Talking back to the content of my site, any good source or author could help me improve the professionalism of the site?

I really appreciated your suggestions.",0,2.0,2017-11-29,ECOM,0.024396134540438652,0.9234282970428467,0.052175626158714294
ecommerce,Advice for Amazon PPC Ads - I can't spend enough money,"Hey guys, wanted to see if anyone has any advice on this. I'm kind of new to Amazon PPC Ads, but I'm selling a product on Amazon FBA, and I've set an AUTO Ad Campaign with a $10 daily limit. Yet Amazon is only spending about a dollar a day on it, but otherwise my metrics are good: 1.45% CTR, 11% ACoS. So far It's spent $12 in about 10 days, with 4000 impressions and 60 clicks. My profit margins are really good on this product because I make it myself, so I can afford spending a lot on Ads, I just can't figure out how.
