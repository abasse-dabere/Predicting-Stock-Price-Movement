I have been checking out Flynax which fulfils most of those requirements from a classifieds perspective, but doesn't seem to offer any shopping cart functionality.

ecommerce,Ecommerce Woes.. Help im at my wits.,"**Back Story**

Back in September of 2013, I was hired by a small business that's in a niche market to proceed with the online portion of the business, they had a website already and they paid the past web designer 3,000$ to create a website for them and 400$ a month concurrently to maintain that site. I was shown the site and it was a utter disgusting shit of a site, they were basically scammed for their money, and I was brought on board to take over this online portion of the business. I was hired to change our platform, as it was PHP Zencart ( severely outdated) I moved it to Shopify as I seemed it was fit for our massive product inventory and variants. While I was working on the new shopify platform we did get a couple sales during the 2 months until we had the website ready on shopify. (Few as in around 10 sales in 2 months)

We finally opened up On the 25th of November. Our opening day we had like 2 or so sales.. It was also the first time I tried out AdWords it didn't work out really well (stopped after 2 weeks.)
also to note,  We still aren't ranked #1 for our business niche till this day. Even for our business name!

The business is in the beauty department of things, we have a special niche that is fairly new, my main competitors have been in the game for over 5+ years and 10+ years respectively. We've been in the game for 5 Months now, sold around... 5,000$ maybe? in 5 Months. This is a fraction compared to how much they make in the store front, possibly 5,000 is how much they make in a day, give or take.

http://i.imgur.com/1oXK2Zv.png This is our whole progress since opening on Shopify.

I've been really stressed out recently and hired a SEO expert to 1 month ago exactly and the sales just this week have actually picked up, meaning we had around 1 sale a day at least for almost a week now. I can't really tell how this happened or why? (http://imgur.com/jfAGk7x )

Our traffic has actually jumped too from this as you can see, I want to hope that its the SEO work that we've been putting into the site.

We also haven't started Adwords with google yet. I plan on more social media engagement. I refuse to touch FB ads again too.

I want to know if my progress is good? I think its very bad right now, and I fear for my job every day.

ecommerce,Help Picking an E Commerce Platform,"Hi Reddit,

I have an industrial products company, and I'd like to set up an ecommerce site. I have some web developers who can help me out, but the store I'd like to build is a bit unique. I'd like my customers (about 300 a month) to be able to login and purchase products based on the terms we've negotiated with them. They can often buy at unique prices and pay over periods of time. My developers are skilled in typical web platforms (Magento, Shopify, WP plugins), but they're a bit stumped about how to create this unique functionality.

Are there platforms out there geared for these types of situations? If not, any high-level suggestions on how to build this site? I'd like to be able to use a CMS of some sort, to make updating the site simplier.

ecommerce,"Removing ""Add to Cart"" buttons from product list pages - good idea/bad idea?","First, I'm going to use two abbreviations throughout this. I'm not sure if they're common, or if they're just what *my* company uses. They are:

PDP - Product Display Page. Shows all the info about a single product, including images, reviews, etc.

PLP - Product List Page. Shows a list of multiple products. Often a category or search-results list.

---

Anyway, I've been trying to come up with ways to declutter my ecomm site, and I've been wondering if it's a good idea to remove the Add to Cart buttons from my PLPs. (Obviously not from PDPs.)

It seems like people aren't going to use them unless they're already quite familiar with the product, and have no need to go to the PDP. If you're selling common items (boxes of Cheerios, Snickers bars), it's probably a good idea to keep the A2C button; but if you're running a gift/unusual item site like me, people won't be familiar with most of your stuff, if any of it.

I just did a quick check of a few sites. Target, Walmart, ThinkGeek, and Amazon don't have A2C buttons on their PLPs, but Home Depot does.

I can't really think of any reasons to keep the A2C buttons, but that's why I'm making this post. Am I forgetting something? Are there any good reasons to keep them?

ecommerce,Measuring your B2B ecommerce effectiveness,"With B2B orders ever increasing and industry analysts only predicting a great future for B2B ecommerce, who would want to miss the boat? With B2B ecommerce practices closely following on the heels of B2C ecommerce, a good amount of investments are being made to spruce up the B2B websites and storefront. How can you justify the investments on your ecommerce storefront and how well can you protect the investments made? You can do that by constantly collecting data, analyzing them and acting upon the shortcomings if any.
 
Why measure?
While B2B ecommerce is similar to B2C in ways of the basic customer expectations like: easy search and navigation, accurate product information, and secure payment methods there are many other metrics that can be collected for B2B ecommerce which can serve as decision points.
 
The three main reasons to measure your B2B ecommerce performance are:
 
• To benchmark against competition: With ever changing business trends you need to keep pace with your competitors. Having a well defined metrics will help you benchmark yourself against competitors.
 
• Continuous site improvement: The preferences of users keep evolving and hence you need to keep your site updated to attract them. Measures like the traffic source to your site etc. can help you identify areas of improvement. Also, marketing your web store will take considerable effort for fruition and you need these metrics to help you market your ecommerce site effectively.
 
• Better decision making: Of course the ultimate goal for any business is to generate revenues and armed with metrics you will be able to take better decisions and hence drive initiatives more confidently towards revenue building.
 
What can you measure?
Now we know the importance of measurement, but, what to measure? Apart from the regular business metrics like sales revenues, volumes and the common B2C metrics like shopping cart abandonment rate the following can be measured for a B2B storefront.
 
• Customer Engagement – number of users viewing a product than customers on staying on a generic landing page.
 
• Unique visitors – this will be different as most of the B2B users are repeat visitors and tracking the unique visitors can help you in marketing engagements for new customers.
 
• Average days between purchases – tracking the frequency of purchase for each user of your site will help you in effectively managing your inventory and gauging the busy periods of the year and high value purchase frequencies.
 
• Top products – This metric will help you streamline your sourcing products to enable higher volume of sales.
 
• Non-returning customers – B2B users will have a pattern of visits and clear product ordering profile. A non returning user is most likely a lost customer. Tracking this data will enable you to channel your marketing efforts to attract the customer back to your store.
 
• Traffic Source – This is hugely vital to an ecommerce site from a marketing perspective as you can divert your resources from non-lead generating sources to the ones generating promising leads and returns.
 
These are just a few metrics listed to leave you with a thought that not all B2C and B2B metrics can be comparable. We would like to hear more from you on what you think as the metrics suitable for B2B ecommerce.

http://imgur.com/cITLWzx

Okay so in the image above you can see the standard product form, and with an app I was able to add the custom fields required, then add variables since if you wanted to add your name it would cost additional fees.

Everything on this works perfectly EXCEPT the face that you can select the option ""Add A Name"" ""Add a Number"" or ""Add a Name &amp; Number"" then simply forget to add the name or number and checkout without it giving you an error.

Is there an easy way to tell it to require the person to input if the selection is highlighted?

I should note that I only really work with HTML &amp; CSS and I'm assuming this requires a PHP conditional statement.",2,1,2014-03-06,ECOM,0.03725484013557434,0.9355648756027222,0.027180233970284462

ecommerce,How would you split payments between two people?,"I have what seems like a really simple situation that I can't seem to find any solution for.

My business partner and I live in two different countries. I'm in the USA and he's in Mayalsia. We pool our efforts together on the website, and our products compliment extremely well without being conflicting.

We cannot figure out how to get a single cart system on our website because I cannot for the life of me find a solution to splitting payments based on the item sold to our respective accounts.

I wouldn't mind splitting after the fact based on a weekly sales report, excel can handle calculating the split, but then one of us gets double charged on fees.

Our current model is to use ""buy it now"" buttons on the site which pipes our products to our accounts, but we're starting to add little accessories and with this model our international customers will be paying HUGE amounts of money on shipping, since we charge it currently by the button (by the item).

We're a small store and we only have about 20 items. We don't need any huge enterprise level solution. We are currently using WordPress, and we have experience with WooCommerce, but we're open to anything at this point.

I just need some ways to increase conversions. We get about 5,000 uv's from organic search and convert maybe 4 sales a month. It's terrible! 

Please suggest some changes that can improve this store. I have personal stores that do quite well with conversions and design. I just want this store to generate some constant sales, right now most of our revenue comes from ebay sales.

woocommerce,Experienced users: Downloadable items not displaying or e-mailing links [help],"I used to have both WooCommerce and ""Bulk Photo to Product Importer Extension"" working on my properly configured, requirements-meeting shared hosting server, even though it had a custom theme and a few other plug-ins on it.

I had a variation for bulk uploaded photos called Downloadable per the instructions [here](http://www.theportlandcompany.com/2013/08/photo-to-product-importer-extension-for-woocommerce-documentation/) (just before the halfway point of the entirety of the page). 

When I went to add to that variation providing options for physical products, it didn't work anymore. 

So I took 'em out. Still didn't work anymore, despite being my original setup. 

So I went elsewhere and created a fresh install. Doesn't work!

When I examined an old order that *did* work, the product has ""Downloadable"" checked and the file path has the path to the image file in there as it was created/uploaded/prefixed by the bulk photo extension. On the non-working ones, the only indication for being marked Downloadable or having the correct image paths is product IDs that occur separately from my actual product and aren't displayed in the list, or on the front end of the site.

No support is presently available from the developer and my issue is time-sensitive. I'd appreciate any help. I found a few generic leads on solutions regarding to just WooCommerce itself, like database prefixes, or checking off of correct settings, etc. All are being followed correctly.

Any thoughts?

dropship,Started my first dropshipping site. Feedback would be appreciated.,"So I just started up my first dropshipping website luckydogbeds.com You might ask how I came to decide upon dogbeds and the reasoning was thus:
1. Primary keyterm volume was high
2. Secondary keywords were in the thousands
3. Plenty of long-tail variations in the hundreds
4. Competition: Competition is pretty tough. The first page of the google search query for ""dog beds"" yields big stores with hundreds to thousands of back links. The one good thing is is that all those stores sell more than just dog beds. I thought I might have a chance to rank I only concentrate on dog beds specifically. Realistically, I'm looking at a possible position on the second page of google for the search term ""dog beds.""

I don't really mind if I end up failing on this particular niche. Someone else on this subforum once said that successful entrepreneurs are generalists. That they just keep on going (and failing) until they find something that works.

ecommerce,Six months into a scented wax business. Here to share experiences and get feedback.,"[Our online shop is here.](http://www.randomwax.com)

My girlfriend has always been into scented wax (candles, melts/tarts, etc.). Over the past couple of years I'd hear her complaining about online vendors that couldn't keep inventory in stock and were only open for super-short windows (e.g. One hour once a month.)

""Wait a minute,"" I said to her one day. ""You're telling me demand for these things is so high they have to close their shops most of the time to restock?""

That sounded like a business opportunity to me. I'm a professional mobile app developer, but I encouraged my gf to start up a wax business (she has a full-time job in quality control). I'd handle the business, technology, and marketing and she would come up with product ideas and pour the wax. We'd go in 50/50.

After some research I settled on Shopify. We kicked around a name, and settled on Random Wax of Kindness. I'm not a big fan of punny business names, but considering our target audience and the fact that my gf loved it, I rolled with it. We went with the Simple theme. Not to knock most of our competitors, but their sites are often difficult to navigate, with some questionable design choices (an unholy number of wax sites use the dreaded Comics Sans). We wanted ours to be clean, simple, and highlight our products.

We had several key goals with the website:

1) Offer a large selection. We identified our target audience as mostly females 25-55. We wanted customers to be able to browse a large selection with large, appealing photos of the actual product, along with scent descriptions for each. We currently have over 150 unique items.

2) Keep the inventory well-stocked and up-to-date. We didn't want to be a store that went down due to high demand.

3) Fast turnaround times (TATs). A lot of online retailers in this space have absurd TATs (over a month), and more than a few are just plain unreliable.

4) A quality product. The ""throw"" of a scented wax product refers to the strength of the scent when melted. We wanted products that were aesthetically pleasing and with strong throws. 

5) Affordable. We wanted to be competitive with other vendors on price. We went with flat-rate tiered shipping prices ($2.50 for less than a pound in the US, $5.00 for 1-5 lbs.). We usually take a small hit on shipping. Free shipping doesn't make sense given the size of most orders and our margins, but we can try to offer reasonable rates.

Here are the strategies we've tried to grow out customer base:

1) We're active in social media (We post daily to FB, Twitter, and Google+). We're active on Pinterest and also maintain a blog on our main site).

2) We did a Mardi Gras themed giveaway this year.

3) We offered promo codes for discounts based on holiday items (15% off green tarts for St. Patrick's Day). 

4) We've offered promo codes for first-time buyers.

5) We sent free samples to a number of YouTube reviewers of scented wax.

6) We have participated in sampler boxes (compilations of similar products where we donate product).

Using Shopify, we've integrated Yotpo for reviews and we follow up on abandoned carts via email.

Traffic and sales have grown a bit in the last six month, mostly in the last three months, but we're still not getting near the traffic/sales we want. I realize our product photos are not quite as good as they could be. I'm looking at investing in a better setup to standardize them. But if we're comparing with most competitors, they're still quite good.

I've sought out a lot of advice from forums, blogs, and other websites online and feel like we've done a pretty good job of following it. I didn't expect a slam-dunk right out of the gate (though that would have been nice), but the growth so far just hasn't been on par with the effort. 

And additional advice/critique would be well appreciated. Thanks!",9,3,2014-03-24,ECOM,0.0315149649977684,0.9301575422286987,0.03832748159766197

woocommerce,best place to hire woocommerce website work,"I have built all my own Wordpress websites until now, including a couple using woocommerce.  But i know that i am not as skilled as many people, i do this as an adjunct to my business not AS my business. 

I'm looking for someone to built a site WP based around [Woocommerce Amazon Affiliates plugin from Codecanyon.](http://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-amazon-affiliates-wordpress-plugin/3057503) 

There are a a lot of freelancer websites out there like O-Desk and Freelance.com and so forth, but everyone lists so many skills, it's hard to pick someone who can do exactly what i need.  

How should i word my Job so that i don't get someone who wants to build it in a proprietary fashion that i won't be able to maintain myself after they are done?  I would hate to be locked into having to keep someone employed to make simple changes.

I know, sounds like a stupid N00B question, but i am getting overwhelmed, I have hired people online before who like taking the upfront money, but then bailed on completely the job.  i usually get ripped off at least once before i find someone who i can consistently hire safely.

I've been using Lemonstand V1 for a couple of years now, it's been really decent, though they're zoning it out to make way for V2. They're moving to a cloud hosted monthly cost, without a lot of core features from V1, which means my agency needs to find an alternative.

Obviously the one that stands out is Magento, but I've logged in and clicked around and looks so bad, it appears you have to clear the cache constantly, the backend looks really old, the templates I can't imagine are very friendly to work with either.

I have recently found ""builtwith.com"" which seems to show usage stats for different ecommerce systems, though I cannot seem to find anything very good on that list which looks reliable.

The most promising thing I could find was called ""Sylius"" (http://sylius.org/) which looks fantastic, BUT, it's newish, and there are no docs, it's not being supported by a company, it's only being held up by the community.

ecommerce,Cart system with robust chained payments for a collaborative business,"Greetings /r/ecommerce,

I have a business that is quickly transitioning into a collaborative business. We seek out people in our niche who are making an incredible product and we work with them to use our skills to take both of our products to a whole new level.

We'd like a shopping cart system with robust chained payments. Some of our collaborations may reach 4-5 people. So we'd like to have it setup such that when a customer checks out with multiple items, each of those items with multiple creators, the ecommerce system will effectively chain the correct money to each creator behind the scenes totally invisible to the customer.

There will NEVER be a set percentage for the store. This seems to be the most common chained payments implementation in all of the ecommerce solutions I've seen.

Example:

Cart contains three items, headphone, headphone stand, amplifier 

- Headphone: Costs $280: $140 to John, $80 to Alex, $60 to Ben
- Stand: Costs $80: $80 to John
- Amplifier: Costs $200: $100 to Alex, $100 to Cole


Result:

Customer sees a cart with items, and pays $560. Nothing out of the ordinary

- John gets $220
- Alex gets $180
- Cole gets $100
- Ben gets $60

Note, it doesn't have to fold it all in so nicely. For all I care, John and Alex could both get two paypal transactions.
Note2, we currently use and are familiar with WooCommerce. But this functionality is more important than us using WooCommerce.",2,1,2014-03-27,ECOM,0.028618011623620987,0.9376158714294434,0.033766161650419235

We have a pretty nice business doing a few million dollars a year. We have been growing at a healthy rate. most of our growth comes from adding new product lines. this is very time consuming and tedious. We want to bring someone in full time to add product lines. We have already identified and have the wholesale information for about 200+ vendors that we want to add. my partner, myself and two other employees do this when we are not doing something else running the business. but if we had someone doing it full-time we could add many more products.

ecommerce,"During the past 2 months, we have received quite a lot of traffic as well as done loads of changes, what next?","So let me introduce me and my wife. We both love jewelry as well as small gifts, watches - you name it!  

2 months ago we decided to officially open our webstore and to show some of our products. By recent times, 
we have spent less than 100 euros in google ads and the same amount in facebook post updates. We have also
given away loads of free products in diffrent galas, giveaways etc. with out business cards attached to the prizes,
but haven't received not more than 200 euros worth of sales per month.

We already run multiple backoffice software on the website, such as abandoned carts, deals, discount emails, you name it.
Also, we give away money to charity EVERY month just because we love to support all causes, so currently we are talking
about a loss of 30-100 euros per month on that issue.

What do you suggest we do next? 

A: pack our bags and rethink it all
B: raise the amounts spent on marketing
C: do more redesigning to our website
D: do more online marketing
E: do more offline marketing
F: lower the prices (shipping will always need to stay free, therefore the prices)
G: it's all about the products

The options are limitless, but by now, we are stuck in a corner. Some posts I did on reddit attracted almost 2000 
people visiting the page per day, but didn't lead to any abandoned carts nor sales (abandoned carts get 10% off the prices
next day).

ecommerce,Building an inventory management solution for companies with complex supply chains - thoughts?,"Hey guys,

I am a software entrepreneur working on an inventory management solution for companies with complex supply chains. From my understanding, there is a lack of robust, elegant and affordable tools.

I am building out a reporting system soon and would love to get your thoughts on what metrics are important (things that you would love to be calculated for you and given to you at the click of a button).

I have created a short survey - I appreciate your feedback and look forward to hearing your thoughts and rants :)

dropship,Averaging 1-2 Sales Per Day - Trying to Double - Any Ideas?,"I am currently doing 1-2 sales per day on my drop-shipping websites, it brings in about $50 in profit per day. My goals is to double my current sales. I figure I can do this in two ways, increase traffic at current conversion rate, or increase sales by increasing conversion rate. 

I am in the process of re-writing all my product descriptions to include more info, photos, and anything my customers might want to know about my products. 

What else can I do to bring in more sales/traffic? Right now my source of traffic is CL ads posted across 20-30 major cities, I haven't had much luck getting traffic from anywhere else yet. 

My website is only about a month old, so it's not ranking for anything and I haven't had a chance to do any SEO yet or add any content. 

My overall goal for the year is 5-10 sales per day. My average commission is $25 so that would generate about $125-$250 per day.",19,7,2014-03-31,ECOM,0.03181171417236328,0.9140856862068176,0.05410264804959297

ecommerce,ELI European - US Sales taxes,"I work out of Europe and one of our customers will want to use our e-commerce platform for their US subsidiary. And so, there is the issue of me to understand how US sales taxes work.

So to keep my question simple:

For a subsidiary based on US soil and selling their products aimed at US customers (let's say they can be either individuals or corporations) through a website, what measures do I need to take to correctly display the sales tax for every customer? Does it depend on the company's location? On the customer's location?
