ecommerce,Made the leap from Ebay to my own store. Advice please,"Hi All,

I have been selling vintage clothes on ebay for a few years now and I have just decided to open my own store. I used shopify as it seemed to have a nice feel to it and I like it so far.

This was about a month ago and I have only had a few sales. I have been promoting through facebook, instagram and other forms of social media. 

I would love some advise on how to take my store to the next level.

I have been using and learning about google analytics and web master tools, however the amount of information on these is somewhat overwhelming. What should I be focusing my attention on? The first thing that I noticed is that the average session is only 1.19. The conversion rate from visitor to purchase is also pretty bad.

Thanks in advance. Any input would be much appreciated.",14,5,2015-08-01,ECOM,0.028759311884641647,0.892795741558075,0.0784449577331543
woocommerce,PSA regarding SimplifyCommerce,"For **8 Months**, my small business online has been suffering due to the thousands of dollars being held in limbo by the lack of customer support through SimplifyCommerce. (Wordpress Woocommerce payment processor) 
I have contacted them on numerous occasions but to no avail. By far, the most incompetent and careless support team I have ever dealt with. Rarely will I receive an email response but if I do and follow up, that is where the communication stops. Additionally, they have no phone number and I am unable to reach them in any other manner. I was initially enticed into using their service due to the 0% fee for up to $10,000 but in hindsight, this has been the worst business decision I have made for my company and is greatly affecting operations.

Right now it's just the samples and they are being shipped through Ems which I know from pass experience that it doesn't charge fee to help declare duties.

ecommerce,My top 10 essential components for a successful e-commerce website (taken from Quora),"1) These days you can't take short cuts with the design of your site.  So a good, clean, custom design would be first.
2) Easy navigation is second 
3) Quality product photography (make sure the products can be zoomed into)
4) Mobile-Friendly on iPhone, Android &amp; iPad (though you can probably fit a desktop look to ipad when turned to landscape)
5) Using the cart &amp; horse metaphor, the horse is generating an audience interested in what you have to offer and the cart is your site
6) Make sure your ecommerce site is solving problems otherwise it will be redundant
7) A website name that's relevant to what you're selling.  If you are selling shoelaces it ought to be in the name of the website rather than some made up word or having nothing to do with what you're selling like a made-up word like kwazoo.com or coolstufffromdoug.com
8) Commitment - sales won't come rolling in so tough it up and find ways to bring in sales. There will be dark days when your sales for the day will be zero.  Too bad. Keep going
9) A shopping cart that's flexible for your needs and gives you the ability to expand if need be and user-friendly enough to maintain it on your own with limited coding experience.
10) Customer service skills. You're going to have to interact with customers whether by email, phone, live chat (if you get it) or text.  Every interaction with your customers is an opportunity to show your great your website is. Every one.  Even when they ask dumb questions. Even when they hate you.
11) Bonus: Role Model.  It doesn't have to be in e-commerce. It can be someone you know who inspires you, someone who doesn't quit, someone who handles themselves well when faced with adversity, someone who does their job consistently day in/day out, who are dedicated, professional, intelligent, unwavering.  I get this from a few guys who have been doing what they do well for over 40 years consistently and take what they do as seriously as not take them themselves seriously (they have great senses of humor). They record music and then they tour and then they repeat the process. 40 years. They're called Rush.

shopify,"[Feedback] App for creating sense of scarcity, like on bookingcom","Hello all,

I am a software developer and I need input about an app for Shopify that I’m working on.

What do you think about an app for Shopify that would do similar as Booking.com’s feature for creating scarcity?

For example: 
http://i.imgur.com/NRlBnve.png
http://i.imgur.com/sHNiree.png

The idea here is to boost sales by letting customer know that there are other potential buyers currently viewing that product. Of course other info can be shown like quantity remaining, last purchase etc.
It works for renting but my concern is how would this work for shops that sell digital or physical products. I know it doesn’t directly solve any problem but would shop owners pay small amount for this app, like $10/month, if it does indeed increase sales.

What do you guys think?

Also, if you can, let me know if you can easily understand what the product is/its benefits. Is there enough information on the site to make an informed decision to purchase?

ecommerce,"Opinions on a service, would you use this?","Hello /r/ecommerce 

My team and I wanted to get some feedback from a community we know won't give us false data. If it is a shitty service you will tell us, alternatively if it is a good service we would love to know/get some feedback. 

What we are developing are action based hooks/messages for ecommerce stores and blogs. We want to focus on beautiful theme based messages. If the store looks great and the actionable message looks awful why bother right?. The messages are triggered and delivered to the audience with things you would want to tell them (when they click an item offer to up-selling an additional item with that same one, offering free shipping at a certain dollar amount added to cart, or buying x to be entered into a give away). 

To be clear these are not traditional popups, and we want to keep the user as engaged in the store as possible so they are only triggered by specific actions that are set. All these messages are custom set to the stores themes and images so it looks amazing. 

An example of what we are working with right now, is an commerce store is running a sale at a specific dollar amount (slightly over $10). When they add that dollar amount to their cart they are prompted to enter a secret give away which has some cool stuff. 

What we want to know is,

- What are good products you use for your store internally?
- Does this sound useful/valuable?
- Is there another way you address certain actions in your store?
- Do you track actions in your store? (i.e. someone looks at 5 items one of them for twice as long then clicks away)

Thank you in advance for your answers!",0,3,2015-08-06,ECOM,0.02541488967835903,0.929446816444397,0.04513831064105034
ecommerce,I'm rebuilding my ecommerce website using Wordpress. Will you recommend an ecommerce checkout plugin?,"I love the Brooklyn theme from ThemeForest but that theme doesn't have shopping page abilities. Adding a woocommerce shopping page would throw off the flow of the Brooklyn theme. 
My other option was paying for the Brooklyn theme and then buying a woocommerce theme, but I feel like I should keep that as my last option and try to see if I can find a nice woocommerce theme. 

What are the over all thoughts on woo-commerce? Recommend anything better? I am selling 5 products at the moment.

What woo-commerce theme do you use? Any suggestions for a clean modern woo-commerce theme for a soon to be kickstarted product?

I have taken a plunge into the e-commerce world with my first store: https://www.cityscapecoffee.com

I am hoping to get some feedback from some people with experience and hopefully you will be brutally honest. I am currently drop shipping all of the coffee on the website as I want to keep my initial costs down while I learn the ropes.

Everything on the website is completely done except for the reviews that will be on the home page, I hope to have that completed this weekend. Otherwise, the store is essentially live.

The couple questions I have are:

1) What do you like about the site?
2) What don't you like about the site?
3) What are your thoughts on the opt-in at the top? I want to make sure I try to build a list and I'm trying to make sure the opt-in is seen.
4) How is the navigation? Is it easy enough to find the actual coffee?

Thanks for any critiques you can provide!

UPDATE: I have removed the opt-in and added a pop up which already looks better.

I am working on adding a much more informational menu. I'd like to have the coffees available with an image for each one and a quick description on the flavors of each.

I'm aiming at guys wanting to jump ship from the popular cartridge shaving over to DE shaving. Guys already on the ship would have lots of sites they already get their stuff from. 

* Got social media up and running with reasonable followers/likes on each - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Not spamming any. Mix of stuff to my own and others. 
* Free postage over £25
* Am writing blogs, tips, how tos, the cost benefits etc
* Have tried Facebook advertising (post advertising beard oils as well as just pushing a blog on the cost benefits)
* Payment options: card, bitcoin, Paypal.
* Have offered various vouchers for friends, one of Instagram for end of month, 10% off. 
* SEO not in a bad state. Page titles, page headings, on page copy all edited nicely. Maybe going for too competitive terms. 

Possible issues:
* Too niche? 
* UK postage only. I figured no one would bother paying international because they can buy cheaper elsewhere
* Too much competition? Bigger sites offering bigger range?
* Prices can't be lower. Supply will cut the cord if I drop below RRP. I bundled products and dropped by 10%  get round this

But, no sales. Been running it 6 weeks. A getting 5-30 visits a day. Traffic mostly split between Direct (not me I filter that, so I put that down to friends or visits from apps e.g. Instagram/Facebook), Social (30%), search traffic rubbish so far.

dropship,Quick question,"Good day Entrepreneurs!

I'm hoping that some drop shippers out there could assist me. 

I'm looking to find a drop shipper that carries some products for the website that I'm in the process of creating.  However, pretty much every site either will not let you browse inventory, or if you can browse the inventory you cannot see the pricing.  I need your help for the following reasons:
1. I do not have a tax-ID yet - almost every site requires this in order to create an account 
2. I don't have the capital to buy in to a wholesale drop shipper unless I 100% know that they have the products in looking to ship out at a reasonable cost.

Honestly, all I'm looking for is some intelligence on whether products are carried and what the cost of the product would be.  I'd be willing to compensate you for your time with some custom loose leaf tea for you to enjoy!

shopify,emporiumtop.com - an impressive selection of premium products—available at a competitive prices,"Emporium Top (http://emporiumtop.com) is an online store committed to providing our clients with the premium products they are searching for—but at a highly competitive price. By operating online, we are able to keep our overheads low—passing substantial savings on to you. Below are just a few reasons to make Emporium Top your go-to online retailer.

A Wide Variety Of Products

We consider ourselves fortunate, because we have multiple warehouses and suppliers that we work with from around the nation. This allows us access to a wide variety of products, to meet a wide variety of your personal and professional needs. Whether you are searching for a trending item, or a general item—there is something for everyone.

New Products Added Weekly

Another benefit to having multiple warehouses around the nation, is that we always have a steady flow of new products to add to our online store. It also means that we are less likely to run out of the products you most desire.

Express Your Personality And Style

While you can head to your local retailers for a selection of what you are shopping for, your local retailers are limited by space—and unable to keep more than a few colors, makes, or models of what you need in stock. By turning to Emporium Top, you are able to access a selection of products that better reflects your personality or style—or that simply isn’t available in a local retailer.

Shop By Brand Or Shop By Product

Our online store has hundreds of products available at once. To make shopping a breeze, we allow you to search for the products you desire by brand—or by product name. This way you can explore the brands you already know and love, as well as premium brands you are unfamiliar with.

Shopping Made Fast And Easy

Another benefit to shopping at Emporium Top, is that we make shopping fast and easy! Not only can you browse and place your secure order from anywhere with an internet connection, but your order is always shipped the next business day. This means no heading out in crowds, or trying to fit shopping into your busy schedule!

We have everything from health and beauty, clothing and accessories, electronics, home décor, and much more! We even have many items available in bulk!",0,1,2015-08-12,ECOM,0.02222505584359169,0.9277465343475342,0.050028398633003235

woocommerce,Separate Products from Categories,"Hello all,

I tried searching the sub, and the net but couldn't find a solution to this.  

When in looking through the shop on my page, if the customer selects a category that I have defined to show as ""Both"" (Subcategories and products), I want there to be a clear divide between the subcategories and products.  I followed the example from [this](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/separate-categoryes-and-products-with-a-line-of-title) page and managed hardcode a solution by changing the file:  woocommerce/includes/wc-template-functions.php in the function: woocommerce_product_subcategories(  adding the lines beginning  echo '&lt;h2&gt; lines below:  

    if ( $product_categories ) {
			echo $before;

    echo '&lt;h2&gt;Sub Categories:&lt;/h2&gt;';
			foreach ( $product_categories as $category ) {

				wc_get_template( 'content-product_cat.php', array(
					'category' =&gt; $category
				) );
			}

			// If we are hiding products disable the loop and pagination
			if ( is_product_category() ) {

    echo '&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;';
    echo ""&lt;hr /&gt;"";
    echo '&lt;h2&gt;Products:&lt;/h2&gt;';


				$display_type = get_woocommerce_term_meta( $term-&gt;term_id, 'display_type', true );

				switch ( $display_type ) {  

So the page now looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aeXtDCu.png), so it's a partial solution, however I have two issues with this:  

1)  If I update WooCommerce this will be overridden, so can someone point me in the right direction to incorporate my changes above this into my theme-child function.php file.  
2)  Because I have hardcoded a line break, it adds another line break after the 5th item shown, regardless of whether it's a sub category or product as shown in the image.  Any ideas how to fix that?  

Thank you in advance for any help.   

Edit:  To achieve 2) Add this line before echo '&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;';

ecommerce,Is it just my store or do others get dozens of requests for free stuff every week too?,"I run a few online sporting goods stores (which converge into a single retail store). Two are my own private label brands. I get emails, IG messages, FB messages, Tweets, WALK-IN CUSTOMERS (yes, this phenomenon is not limited to the digital world) non-stop asking for free stuff. This isn't just limited to 13-year-olds either (although it heavily skews that way), I've had guys in their 30's make these requests too.

**Typical requests:** (I've excluded the general charity events too that hound me as I know that's every business)

* ""I'm a really good player and play for team ___ will you sponsor me?""
* ""I'm really well-connected. Want to give me some free stuff and I'll talk it up?""
* ""I have 300 followers will you sponsor me?""
* ""No one knows who your brand is. Why don't you give me some free stuff and I'll review it.""

**Some of the funnier requests (paraphrased for brevity):**

* ""It's my birthday. Can you send me a free ____ ?""
* ""I run a robotics blog and some of my robotics friends also play this sport. If I do a review for you can you give me a 20% discount."" ""[Politely] No."" ""How about 10%? Convince me to buy.""
* ""I'm buying 2 of product ____. Can I get a bulk discount?"" --&gt; This is a frequent one but on a few occasions I've been asked for bulk discounts on $40-60 orders when the free shipping threshold is $95

It's become more of an ongoing joke, but I've mentioned it to people I know personally and we all thought, ""I'd be embarrassed to walk into a store and try to coerce someone into giving me something for free."" 

**TL;DR I'm trying to understand if this behaviour is a function of being in sporting goods, being online, some intersection of the two, or simply  function of being a retailer in general. Prior to starting this 1 year ago I had no on-the-ground retail experience.**

[What is Reseller Hosting? [ infographic ]](http://www.inmotionhosting.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/InMotionHosting_What_is_Reseller_Hosting_infographic-1.jpg)


TL;DR: Was a dropshipper. Became a reseller. Hired as a Reseller manager. Created infographic to share with the community that *made* me. ;)

ecommerce,Why hasn't my ecommerce business made a sale?,"I started a t-shirt company to learn the ways of online business a month ago and haven't made a single sale. I've set up twitter, facebook, instagram, and tumblr for my company and have been posting regularly to no avail. I have $10 a day budget for facebook ads (all I can afford at the moment) which is giving me about 10 visitors every few days. I've also spent a lot of time contacting authors and artists that are involved in my niche to get feedback and hopefully an eventual shoutout of some sort. 

There's no shipping or tax fees for USA customers which I thought would guarantee at least a few sales. My profit margin would be very small if I did make a sale, less than $3-4 a shirt.

My niche is psychedelic patterns, sacred geometry, animals... really just any ""trippy"" design that you would see transformational music festival goers wear. I don't have many designs, just four that come in all sizes and t-shirt/tank-top variations, but I've received nothing but positive feedback from both friends and strangers.

Having put the remainder of my bank account into this business idea (not much, I only had $150 to start), I am beginning to feel the discouragement. What should I do to increase traffic to my site and make a sale? When is the right time to fold and accept my losses?

Feedback appreciated!

woocommerce,Custom Fields vs Attributes,"Hi,

We are looking at setting up an eCommerce site using the Woocommerce platform. We need to be able to indicate if a particular product is re-orderable and if it is currently on back order. I was thinking of having two custom fields, the first one *is re-orderable* with values of [YES / NO], and *is on back order* with values of [YES / NO] | [DATE ORDERED] | [EXPECTED DELIVERY] | [ORDER NUMBER]


I cannot see a distinction between attributes and custom fields and as none of this information needs to be customer facing I am leaning more towards custom fields for this. Has anyone got a similar process in place?

dropship,Drop Ship Savior - Free Guide to how to Drop Ship Like a Boss,"It is I, your dropshipping savior, Drop Ship Jesus. Do not believe in false prophets. Put your faith in me and I shall lead you into the light!!! 

In the beginning, I started listening to Johnny through his podcast. When I finally got the chance to meet Johnny &amp; Larissa, it just rubbed me the wrong way. I brought up Drop Shipping lightly and then he kept redirecting me to Drop Ship Lifestyle and almost felt like the course was a secret and we couldn’t talk about it unless I was a student. And, I was about to buy it because I wanted to be a part of the team, but I just didn’t want to pay $1000 for it. So, I decided to take a short cut which was against his teachings for the devil inside of me was strong. 

I listened to his podcast almost religiously to see if I could learn something from it. Eventually, I felt like I listened to him enough to put the drop shipping puzzle together. There was one episode where he talked about how he unfriended a girl on Facebook because she was asking him questions on about dropshipping because she was like me and didn’t want to buy the product for $1000. A year later he got a message from her saying she made her first sale and he said that it was great that she made her first sale, but she wasted all her time when she could’ve just bought the product and made the money sooner. I can’t remember the rest, but it seemed like he justified that unfriending her was the right thing to do. I was like WOOOOW I didn’t know friendship cost money.  But DSJ’s love is free for all. 


So here I am. The only advice I took off his podcast and his blog was to listen to more podcasts instead of music. I've actually listened to enough podcast episodes like eCommerce Fuel, MyWifeQuitHerJob, Build My Online Store, Tropical MBA, Empire Flippers, and Travel Like a Boss Podcast to get a clear picture of how to run a dropshipping store. And after listening to eCommerce Fuel/Andrew Youderian’s interviews, I learned there is no ""defense"" when it comes to dropshipping. Anyone can come in and sell the same products as you. You’ll also find out that you don’t need to pay $1000 to learn how to be successful when the best way to get started is to copy a store that is already running because they are using all the techniques/tricks that are taught in www.dropshiplifestyle.com right? 

Step 1 – Pick a Niche

I could not think of a niche to sell things on. A halo appeared above my head and I realized I could just copy someone’s store.
I actually did the same thing as described by typicaldropshipper and googled the template used on Johnny’s www.Tiffanylampcollection.com :


[OurWebSite] is an online retailer providing competitive prices on [our niche products]. We aim to provide a memorable experience when you shop on our online store, offering quality products with a top rated customer service.

We are based in [location], with offices nationwide. We distribute worldwide via FedEx, UPS &amp; First Class Priority Mail.

We have been operating for over [time frame] and have managed to build up a reputable establishment online. We have a great team offering our customers the best [our niche products] available.


You can do that for all the other pages as well. 

Some of the results that come up: 
https://premium-fish-finder.myshopify.com/

And off typical dropshipper’s post: 
www.ergouplift.com - $298
www.buybabybuggies.com - $694
www.modernairplus.com $342
www.buymassagetables.com - $3,953
www.adirondackchairsmarket.com - $5,524
www.coffeetablesusa.com - $201
www.pressurewashdirect.co.uk - $268
www.drone-ventures.com - $793
www.razorsharpshave.com - $952


Here’s my experience with this. I did this before and got a list of people who were selling stuff. Finally, I did go forward with a Niche. And guess what happened to the guy who had the store I was gonna copy? He shut down. So after two weeks of adding products to my page and contacting suppliers, I just realized I wasted my time because if he failed, I probably wasn’t going to make any money either. Then I went to double check some of the other sites I saved, and they shut down. I had a list of 50 websites. Only 2 of them were still around. That’s like 4% success rate. I felt like I would’ve gotten ripped off if I paid $1000 for such a high failure rate. So my first store failed before it even began.  

More ways to find niches:

Go to sites where you can sell/buy sites and look for e-Commerce stores. They usually disclose what their profits are or you can gauge how well the store is doing by looking at how much they are selling it for. I would not be surprised if all the DSL member’s stores go for sale soon, then you can find even more profitable niches pretty easily. 

Go on Fiverr and find people who will do short videos for $5 that says, “Welcome to XYZ Store. Blah blah blah.” If you’ve found a few guys/girls who do this, you can easily find other eCommerce Stores that have used them as well. You can back trace them to more stores. 

Go on Fiverr and find logos that the artists have done and backtrace them to more stores.

Reverse Google Image Search their about us Page to see if they are just pulling pictures off tumblr or flickr because then you know for sure they are just dropshippers. 
Etc. 

Reverse IP Search. Shopify hosts a ton of sites and you can find them. If they are on Shopify or BigCommerce, they are probably dropshippers. 

Step 2 – Getting a list of suppliers

To get suppliers, GOOGLE  your product then look for sites who could potentially be dropshippers. Then go to each of the websites to see if they are also dropshippers. They are most likely dropshippers if they don’t have a warehouse location or say they have a ton of warehouses. You can even call them and ask where their warehouses are located because you don’t trust that their site is legit. But since we used the first method of finding dropship stores, you can just copy their manufacturers. 

Let’s use Johnny’s example of Tiffany Lamps, Ceiling fixtures, Wall Scones, or Windows and you get this: 

Chloe, CA Lighting, Meyda, Tiffany-Style , so on and so forth.

Another one: Buybabybuggies.com – Stroll-Air, Baba, Englacha, etc.

You get the idea. Google the manufacturers and then call them after you built up a website. 

You’re also thinking, hey if they change their templates for About Us or Shipping &amp; Returns, that means we won’t be able to find their stores anymore right? Wrong. As long as you know that the manufacturer dropships, you can find other sites/competitors by googling for the product itself and eventually their site will show up. To get more ideas, Websites like Hayneedle and Wayfair are exclusively dropshippers, so you know anything they sell, you can sell as well (for the most part). There are other medium sites that are dropshippers as well. 

Step 3 – Build your Website &amp; Miscellaneous stuff

Get Reseller Certificate from your local state. Set up Federal EIN. Set up UPS business account. Set up Business License (optional) or be sole proprietor.

Join Shopify. I don’t have an affiliate link, but maybe one day I will edit this and add one. And hopefully you guys will click it and give that affiliate monies!!!

Copy their site. Copy their Suppliers. Copy their products. Copy their title tags. Copy everything. Add your 50+ products and 3-5 product images per product. Set to the LOWEST PRICE and match your competitors. If they are breaking MAP, you break MAP by matching them. 

Set up payment in shopify, set up all the stuff in there. 

Add:  Logo (can get from Fiverr or make your own, Phone Number (Google Voice or Skype for cheap or pay for more expensive ones), Email Address, About Us, Price Guarantee, Shipping &amp; Returns, Contact Us, FAQ, Privacy Policy, whatever else is on Johnny’s site. 

You can now contact suppliers or :


You can do this later:
Add more stuff: Trustguard, Authorized Dealer stickers, Security Badges, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter. Buy Facebook, Twitter, Instagram followers on Fiverr. Visa &amp; Credit Card Logos, Free Shipping Logos. Always offer free shipping. Add Expiring coupon so people are more likely to buy. Put it in big flashing letters so they can see it. Add optional video with you speaking or with someone from Fiverr (As shown in Step 1) to show you are legit. Like this : https://imgur.com/0Ts3Vqk,pJCDZq1,WcMk6nI,KQFtuO3
https://imgur.com/0Ts3Vqk,pJCDZq1,WcMk6nI,KQFtuO3#1
https://imgur.com/0Ts3Vqk,pJCDZq1,WcMk6nI,KQFtuO3#2
https://imgur.com/0Ts3Vqk,pJCDZq1,WcMk6nI,KQFtuO3#3



Add Review plugin. Take Reviews off sites like Amazon or wherever because those are legitimate reviews from real buyers and add them to your products. Because you are selling the same product, it is OK to do this. Also change the descriptions for products so it isn’t just the stock description from your manufacturer. You can use a word spinner or something to change it.  If you have 1000 products, just add to the best sellers.  (Also can google search the reviews to see if they have been reposted on other eCommerce Stores). You can also wordspin your reviews. 

Add coupon pop up

After your site is up, then you can contact suppliers.

Step 4 – Get Suppliers

Call all the suppliers in your list of Step 2. I’ve called a few and this is how it typically goes. “Hey, I’m from XYZ Store.com and  I’m wondering if you guys are accepting new accounts?”  Then tell them you are a dropshipping business and ask if they dropship (of course they do).  They will tell you their terms of doing business with them. Then, make sure they accept credit card. If you have a rewards card, you can get free air miles like Johnny! Tell them you’re gonna pay for all orders up front and won’t need a line of credit. Some will ask you how much money you are making, but just lie so you can get approved. They will ask what your traffic sources are, etc. And if you flunk some of these questions you won’t get approved. Some manufacturers will ask you if you are carrying other manufacturers that are similar to them and if so how you will differentiate their product line with the other ones. So, you actually need to know the features/styles of your brands. Come up with something creative. Good thing I was listening to so many podcasts I was able to regurgitate what I just listened to about advertising/marketing. 

Some manufacturers will require references. Then you are SOL because you’re brand new. Actually, they are starting to do this now because some markets are getting saturated and they are getting a TON of new inquiries from DSL members, then you have to be creative or call them back after you’ve started making sales.  
Some manufacturers will only take wire payment. Some manufacturers will require a shipping account as I said to open a UPS account on Step 3. If not, ask them if you could ship on their account. 

Fill out their application forms and return. 

I’m probably missing stuff, but do your homework and it helps to know about the products that the company you are calling carries. So if they specialize in Blue Widgets and not Red Widgets, then you should know that. Or if all their widgets are round versus their competitors which are square. Etc.

I would say about 70-80% of suppliers will see their competitors on your website and believe you are legit and approve you. Also remember to hide products of your supplier you are trying to contact before you contact them so it doesn’t look like amateur hour. 

Step 5 – More  Stuff

Make a Blog. Add Value. SEO Stuff. Get Emails

Sign up for Mail Chimp. Sign up to your competitor’s email list and copy their email template that they send you because they have most likely figured out the best way to make a sale if they have been in business for a while. Change it up and make it your own. This will save yourself a ton of time. They will most likely be using the stuff they learned from DSL and by copying it; you in essence learned the same thing for free. They most likely won’t send shitty emails to fool you and jeopardize their email base. 
Copy the time of the week they send it, the day, etc. etc. 

Same for Facebook and Pinterest.

Update your About Us and all the other pages to make it different from stock so people can’t find you. And your about page should be some cool story about how this product benefited you and why you are selling it. 

To entice buyers to buy from you, add free gifts related to your niche  like an ebook or something super cheap. 

Copy whatever else your competitor is doing. 

Step 6 – 
Get Google Product Listing Plugin
Import into Google PLA. Match up the SKUs and all the stuff. SET UP TRACKING.  And make sure they are showing up on google. Then, pay Google for clicks and ascend to drop ship heaven!!!

Google made PLA retarded easy. Don’t pay anyone money to learn how to do it because I am 80-90% sure it’s already on Google.com. When you find something that sells, then up your bids and keep upping it until your profits decrease per item. 

Step 7 – If you actually get customers, use shopify to invoice the order and send to supplier. 

All in all, I would not have paid $1000 to learn something that you can copy once you find a drop shipping site to copy. That’s why I can’t believe that Johnny continues to pimp his product and do product reviews against other Dropship Courses that are a fraction of DSL’s price and still recommend DSL. Not to mention you can find how to dropship from Google. This site answered everything else I was looking for when I first started and it’s free: http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/tutorials/e-commerce/  

Dropshipping stores have zero defenses to other competitors. Anybody can come up and sell the same product with the exception of suppliers requesting references. The only time you can defend a store and increase the chances of people buying from you is if it requires an expertise. An example I can use is maybe Andrew Youderian’s site Rightchannelradios because customers might need help installing it or someone who knows how to use them or whatever. Personally, I wouldn’t copy rightchannelradios just because I don’t know anything about radios, but if I really wanted to, I could do it if I can get approved as a dealer. 

Long term, you need a niche where you can add value. Like archery, diving, or anything hobby related. 

So many people failed and a ton of sites are closed up now, but Johnny got rich. He even made $43,000++ in selling DSL according to his screenshots on Earnest Affiliate. Now he’s selling Earnest Affiliate for $200 while using Reddit to promote his blog. I’m going to guess that part of his course is to post onto Reddit for “free” traffic, but now Reddit is telling him to GTFO. If this isn’t telling to potential buyers, then I don’t know what is. And if this is a lesson in how easy it is to deconstruct a course, I am 90% confident I can deconstruct Earnest Affiliate by using JohnnyFd.com and Myfightcamp.com as examples. Btw, his #1 student only gets 2 page views per month and has zero backlinks.  http://www.semrush.com/info/PaupertoPrincess.com

ecommerce,Ecommerce selling Knife Sharpeners. Is this a good business compared to Consumer Electronics?,"I want to break into the Ecommerce business and went from thinking of selling Consumer electronics, to gardening, to now Knife Sharpeners. Consumer Electronics is a big business with a lot of volume but it is also very competitive and there is a lot of moving parts associated with the build of electronic devices.  I want to find a Niche product that has a fairly good variation of products, appealing to a large crowd, less moving parts, and a chance to grow. With electronics there are so many things to sell. Cellphone cables, power banks, headphones, wireless keyvboards, bluetooth speakers, etc etc. But again so much competition. Will I stand out? But with Knife Sharpeners, a much smaller niche I appeal to home consumers, outdoors people, and also businesses like restaurants. It's a much smaller niche but it's also less moving parts and maybe a better chance to stand out. I can expand to knives, and maybe other areas associated with sharpeners.  Knife Sheaths, stone sharpeners, rod sharpeners, etc etc.

What's not working? I'll copy our previous submission below so you have some context with what we're doing. Our instagram handle is ""kntydesign"" and this is where almost all of our traffic comes from.  
Thanks!



So first I'll do these survey questions to get as much info down as possible. Our products are rope bracelets.
1) We started with a nautical theme but our first couple orders came from all-around outdoor-sie people so we're kinda leaning towards that.
2) Our motivation to start a business was just that, my buddy and I wanted to start a business for the sake of it. A lot of people post on here that you need tons of passion for what you do but we haven't really felt that yet. We picked something semi-randomly and went with it. What we're passionate about is solving problems and trying to understand how the world works I guess. It's incredibly interesting just trying to get something like a small business to work.
3) We've been working on it for just under 4 months now.
4) We don't really think of things in terms of what we'll be doing in X months down the road. Mostly we plan by figuring what what's next, and whats after that. Some things I have planned as a function of the volume we're doing. We've literally just started selling things and we're hoping it keeps picking up.
5) Obviously the most positive experience so far has been the shock of someone actually finding our little website on the giant ocean of the internet and spending money on it.
Finally to my questions for our audience:
How is our site? Is there any glaring mistakes or things you would change? We think it's pretty good but it's helpful to have strangers give an opinion. Mom just keeps saying it's ""great""...
How do you guys determine your prices for products? Especially when you have retail vs wholesale. I keep finding ""Retail = Wholesale X 2"" but rules of thumb like that never site well with me. What do you do?

ecommerce,I want to have my e-commerce site MY way.,"Hey,
I am trying to set up an online store on my website. Unfortunately I have tried multiple e commerce platforms only to be disappointed. I want my store to match my site template, which I have already spent days on developing. If I had the option I would skip e commerce and just code the platform myself, however, I am $#!+ with PHP and MySQL, seeing as how I have never done any. I'm not really in the mood to learn another language if possible, but the lack of design freedom on e commerce sites is disappointing, I would at least like to be able to change the UI via HTML / CSS.  Not to mention I find certain features such as a poll, superficial. 

FINALLY: I HATE the idea of being responsible for running a server containing the usernames / passwords and billing info of my customers.

ecommerce,Struggling to find my niche,"Hi guys so I live in New Zealand and I've just launched an e-commerce store through a platform called Trademe. It's basically like the NZ version of ebay but due to the difference between here and the USA, there is somewhat less competition and the price of stuff is more expensive. Anyway...I imported a bunch of authentic NBA snapbacks, now these are somewhat dying out but I had two sales in the first week which was kinda encouraging but none since(opened last tuesday) but I have a lot of watchers on my items. I have all these great ideas like start an instagram/facebook page etc etc and that would really help me sell through multiple channels and build up a reputation. Here's the catch I'm also thinking about selling gym clothing(sweat pants, stringers etc) and also just general clothing(can get some sick quirky stuff on aliexpress that would defs sell here) but I feel like that waters things down and I'm gonna become another run of the mill ecommerce dude on trademe that doesn't differentiate from the crowd. What do you guys think? It's frustrating as hell because I think I need to be in multiple categories to make enough sales but I also want to specialise.

ecommerce,The best online payment solution for my Shopify site?,"Hey guys! 

For around a year, I have been running my small business, domestically, through my facebook site and for a while it has been way to much trouble keeping track of orders, customer information, retention rate etc. 

So, for that reason, I have decided to open up an ecommerce store through Shopify, as the general consensus seems to be that it is the way to go for non-techies / web developers.

I just created my account and one of the first things I noticed is the large selection of Credit Card Gateway solutions. So, the question I ask you is twofold:

- Do you have any recommendations for a payment method I should use next to PayPal 
- Does it matter if a Credit Card Gateway is not available in my country? (I operate in Iceland)

See Link:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/346622185617571/permalink/346624908950632/

FWIW:  we have been in a merchant rate agreement with PayPal for a few years at 1.9% plus $.30 cents (regardless of monthly revenue).  I started noticing our fees were higher and realized PayPal had jacked us up to 2.5% plus $.30.   

Today I called and spoke to Merchant Sales at PayPal to try and renegotiate our rate and was told by the rep that in October, Paypal is abandoning the merchant rates completely, and that ALL merchants, regardless of revenue, would be paying a flat rate of 2.9% plus $.30 cents .. period.   She said there were no exceptions. I find this hard to believe.  

She indicated that is for PayPal/PayPal Express type payments only, and that merchant credit card processing rates (ie. PayFlow Pro) were still based on agreement.

I discussed this at length with the lady and she said they were preparing to send out letters and notices to all merchants.  I expressed my frustration and she said they were all preparing for the backlash, but that Paypal seemed determined to make this happen.

ecommerce,Platform to integrate a rails application,"I'm looking for recommendation for an e-commerce platform I can integrate my existing rails 4 code into.

I started building an e-commerce site with ruby on rails for selling baseball cards. I have no backgeround in e-commerce so I'm sort of figuring that part out as I go along. I don't even program professionally. 

Because the site sells baseball cards there are certain features that I wanted and have implemented. I have a custom schema so that I can order on team/product type/manufacturer/year/grade/player college and more. I have multiple fancy types of searches, autocomplete, and a fancy inference system that for adding cards that looks at tables of what cards exist. I'm using rails 4, active record and postgres. I need fancy search, and I need fast data entry since the site will be mostly be selling individual cards, some of which have will have very low prices.

I have a prototype quality shopping cart, checkout and order processing back end using ActiveMerchant for payment and ActiveShipping for shipping. I've spent the last 4 or 5 days dealing with purchasing shipping and printning labels and stuff and it's been a sobering experience. I'm starting to think that programming the e-commerce part myself is a mistake. I would prefer to put all my effort into the baseball card specific parts like search and fast data entry. The whole customer front end basically works though, although it gets a little sloppy at checkout and shipping  still has a few bugs to work out.

I have a admin backend for order processing and shipping as well, but it extremely basic at the moment.  

I'm looking for a recommendation for a platform that I could potentially integrate into that could accomplish the e-comerce parts of the site. I would really like it to have a pre-built UI for the admin backend that can be used for processing orders, shipping, tracking and analytical. I would like to be able to make ""plug-ins"" or something so I could make pages, but I would settle for just an API. 

If there's something with checkout, shipping forms and a shopping cart for the customer front end that I could just CSS and integrate with little effort that would be really nice, although I do realize I will probably have to do my own front end entirely and probably use an API. I have this pretty much working too, except for shipping which is a super pain so it wouldn't be a huge deal breaker. I'll take what I can get though. 

I can lose rails in my code, but I need to keep ruby, active record and my db with it's schema or I lose almost everything.

I would appreciate any recommendations for anything that would help me out.

ecommerce,Avoiding SEO drop with site migration? HELP!?,"We are about to migrate our website from a Drupal platform to a Shopify platform. Basically our webdevs have screwed us over delivering well below specification and way over budget.

Most of the issues I can fix, however there's one I'm having a lot of trouble finding an affordable solution to.
Our current site on Drupal is protected by a SSL certificate and when we launch our Shopify site only the checkout will be SSL secured. Google will identify us as a new website. This means we'll lose our SEO ranking in the top 4 on Google and be relegated to the 4th or 5th page of google.

We've looked at redirecting the old pages to the new but we'll still take a massive SEO hit as the redirect will have the same issues with the SSL cert. Shopify does offer SSL certification for the entire site, however it costs $995NZD (~1350USD) a month, and a business our size can't do that.

Any and all suggestions are welcome, we would even consider a rebuild if we can do it ourselves.",6,2,2015-08-28,ECOM,0.040511518716812134,0.9091300964355469,0.0503583662211895

woocommerce,How to create mass number of product variations?,"Hello,

I'm starting an online apparel business. Right now, I'm setting up my first t-shirt design. Here is the problem:

* The design comes in 28 different colors.
* Because of my supplier, not all colors come in all sizes. For example, many colors only come up to 2XL, another group up to 3XL, and then another group up to 5XL... and then three colors also come in tall sizes.
* Anything Tall or 3XL+ costs more

Right now I'm tediously working my way through adding each variant. For example, I manually add a variation for each size a color comes in which involves adding N amount of variation entries, going through and individually selecting the color again and again and again, and then going back through and selecting each size it comes in, THEN going back through and selecting the right color mockup... again and again and again while inputting one of two prices.

I'm at 130+ variations done this way and it's taken hours upon hours to do this. Is there any plugin or method that can expedite this?

It'd be nice if I could say the shirt comes in X colors, and then those colors come in Y sizes. All shirts with Z sizes are this price. All Shirts with all other sizes are this. Add THIS picture to all variations with P color.

Honestly, my head already feels like its about to explode doing it one by one by one...

I would like to start a wholesale/dropship business that offers dropshipping and wholesaling services to my customers. This service would be the same as all other standard dropshipping services where one of my customers sells a product of mine and my company would ship the product direct to my customers customer.


Ideally I would buy wholesale unbranded goods from both Chinese manufacturers and local wholesalers/distributors with brand name goods.

At the moment I think that I would sell consumer electronics &amp; accessories, clothing and apparel and sporting equipment &amp; supplies.


These are a few question to the dropshippers of reddit:
- What features make a reliable dropshipper?
- What products would you like to be able to dropship? (in addition to your current ones)
- What features would you like in a dropshippers website?
- Where does your current dropshipper fall short?

woocommerce,"About to launch my first Woocommerce store, I'd really appreciate some last minute tips and suggestions","Hi everyone! 

I've been developing websites for quite some time now but this is my first time working with Wordpress. I've also never had to take security this seriously so I want to make sure I'm doing everything right. I've been searching this subreddit and Google in general for the essential steps and plugins, but a lot of those suggestions/articles are out of date. So I thought I'd make a post.

I'm not processing any payments on the site. Just taking orders and payment will be collected in cash after local delivery. 

I have full **SSL enabled** from visitors to cloudflare, and then a self signed certificate on my server to encrypt data between cloudflare and my server. 

I'm on **shared hosting**, but I've been with them for a long time and it's really fast. I've been developing on the live server (cPanel webdisk really makes things easy) since mostly what I'm doing are some tweaks here and there. Everything has been quite fast so far. 

I have **wpMandrill** sending out all transnational emails via Mandrill. I have **Yoast SEO** for all things SEO. I have **Google Analytics** on instead of Jetpack, and instead of a plugin I just check the stats on Google's page. I'd really like to keep the number of plugins minimal.

I have **Legull** for TOS and Privacy Policy. I've also made adjustments to those to fit my needs.

**Now I need a good security plugin** as I don't want to rely on Cloudflare. I've made most of the basic security precautions such as picking a different admin name, applying an htpasswd to my admin directory and such. 

I'm not having any comments or reviews on my products, **do I still need an anti spam measure?** May be to prevent bots from signing up for accounts?

**What about caching?** Again I don't want to rely on Cloudflare just in case it doesn't cache dynamic pages correctly. What plugin would you recommend for that?

I also need a **newsletter plugin** to send out periodic newsletters to the account holders only if they have opted in. Ideally I'd like to use Mailchimp, but I need some way to export all the eligible email addresses from Wordpress, or do this from within it.

Any other essential plugins that I'm missing?

ecommerce,How do you even get visitors?,"I'm a designer and finally know enough about web development that I theoretically could make a functioning ecommerce store using Stripe for credit card payments and general ability to make the whole thing look professional. It seems like any niche I can think of, though, would be invalidated by Ebay, Etsy, and Amazon. In other words, I mean people can just buy the same sort of thing from a site they already use and trust.

It seems like you have to be offering something really high end or something really special to get people to buy from you instead of some other more popular site. There are two examples I can think of and both would involve a fairly large overhead...using ""guitars"" as an example product, either (A) offering a high-end boutique guitar for thousands of dollars each (which requires some groundwork to get the word out for sure), or (B) offering high-quality Chinese imports for cheaper than any other big box store will offer a decent guitar. Option B is already a fairly saturated market, though.

My thinking basically moves along A and B for any product I can think of. I'm sure it's self-defeating over-thinking on my part, but if I had some idea of how anyone gets the world out about their e-commerce store, I'd be more apt to try something.
