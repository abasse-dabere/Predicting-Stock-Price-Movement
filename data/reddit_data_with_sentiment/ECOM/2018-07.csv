ecommerce,Help with managing business 24/7 - Virtual Assistant? - Work load too much!,"Hi there!

So I was wondering if anyone could possibly point me in the right direction. 

I run a successful niche business but have also just graduated as a Pharmacist. I have a very intense training year where I will be working full time plus studying. During my studies I also found balancing my time rather difficult too. 

The thing that I am most worried about is compromising customer service as I simply will not be able to access my accounts from 9 - 5 and will need to focus on extra study. I am looking into virtual assistants but it seems like most of the reviews are fake and I don't want to pay for say a block of 5 hours and there be only a handful of messages for them to respond to as I wish to utilise my resources carefully and spend on design etc. In terms of set tasks I currently use Fiverr and it has been okay but only for specific long jobs and I need someone that will check in every couple hours or so to monitor emails, instagram messages and comments. 

I have looked into apps (my website is on shopify) such as zendesk in order to issue tickets as problems quite literally get lost in my email (it's a total nightmare right now, any tips of email organisation would be great). I have also toyed with using a chatbot AI as people do really ask mundane questions a lot of the time. However, I would like to remain as personal as possible.

ecommerce,How to prevent subscription cheating?,"Hey all, here's a pretty specific problem. I'm setting up a subscription service that offers a new download every week while subscribed + the past 3 weeks downloads. I always want the previous 3 weeks downloads available to a subscriber so there's an immediate incentive to pay for a subscription. However, it dawned on me that a user could subscribe at the start of a month (edit: initial billing applies), unsubscribe right before their next billing period, then resubscribe 3 weeks later to get the same amount of downloads while being unsubscribed for 3 weeks. Could there be a creative way around this?

Edit: Consider this solved for now, going to not give it much attention and focus energy elsewhere. Will check in a few months to see if it's even a problem. Great advice from everyone!",9,5,2018-07-01,ECOM,0.025371549651026726,0.9300276041030884,0.04460090771317482

dropship,How to find Top selling Hot and Winning Products to Dropship,"I believe it's no news that many are making it big in dropshipping while some are frustrated and thinking to close their store in the next minute because they are not making their intended profits. However, things would be different if we can follow a simple formula!

Which is, get a product that people want so bad, take the product to them through promotion and keep your profits. You can keep repeating this formula until you get tired. Trust me, with this, you can now make your YouTube post also bragging on how you make your first $20,000 in two weeks or less... lol!

These are just for quick cash though, if you want to become an authority in your niche then you going to need a lot more than that. You need to start thinking of how to invest in SEO, tools and other means to root your store in your chosen niche.

Here is over... [10 plugin and ad-dons to supercharge WordPress/Woo-commerce store](https://torchbankz.com/best-dropshipping-plugin-alidropship).

If your store is rooted already, adding top selling products from other store might just be a plus bonus for you.

**How to find top selling and Winning Products**

This method is absolute free and the platform were searching it from is Shopify. All you need is a keyword niche for the type of product you want to sell.

What you need to do now is head over to Google search engine… and type in the following – ***site:myshopify.com “keyword”*** (keyword for your product niche)

The google search result is going to bring out lots of Shopify site, what you need to do is open each single one of them on a new tabs in other to visit every single one of them.

Once you start visiting the store you will see their top selling products but majority if not all of them will hide this because of competition. But not to worry there is a hack to find it.

What you need to is go to the main products display page that show multiple products display. After that simply add the following to the URL of the page… **?sort\_by=best-selling**

That should bring out their best selling products. The next thing is to save the images of the products and search them with Google images to locate their supplier on AliExpress.

However, there's a tool that can do all the hard work for you, they offer free membership plan also, It’s called EcomHunt. You can read the full [EcomHunt Review Here](https://torchbankz.com/complete-ecomhunt-review)

**Here's the profit part!**

Once you've located that product on AliExpress check the price and compare it to what they are selling it on Shopify store you searched the products from.

let's say the product is been sold for $29 on Shopify and you were able to find the product for $10 or less i'll suggest you go for it.

But if the price is high you could look around and find a supplier selling slight lower. You'll definitely see one.

woocommerce,Product management problem,"Hello everybody,

I have around 35k products, 7 suppliers and a problem regarding the management of those products for each supplier. I have no idea how I can set the products out of stock without affecting the products from other suppliers (supplier not product brand/manufacturer) When a supplier is providing his list of products he includes only the products that are in stock.

I have used WP ALL IMPORT to import all the products and I know there's an option to remove the products that are not existing in the import list. That would be ok if I had only one supplier, but by checking that would delete the products from other suppliers.

My idea was to find a solution in managing the products for each supplier so when I receive a list from Supplier\_A I can check that option to remove the products but without affecting the products from Supplier\_B, Supplier\_C, Supplier\_D.

I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one with this problem. If it's not clear what I want to mean let me know. I'll try my best to explain.

dropship,Started My Dropshipping site last Saturday - Here are the results...,"Hey everyone!

First time poster under this subreddit. The strategy I'm running is from Store Formula 3 by Jon Mac. I'm usually the type of person who procrasinates but i said ""f\*ck, let's do it"" and I didn't hold back. I followed his formula pretty much to a T.

**Here's what I did.**

1. I set up an e-commerce drop shipping store on CommerceHQ (i had previous experience with shopify - not a dropshipping store)
2. I found particular items that I was going to be selling based on the program's suggestions
3. Once I found about 25 items I wanted to test, i launched 25 campaigns, 3 ad sets for each campaign (75  ad sets) then another 3 ads for each ad set.. so in total first day I was running 225 ads in one day.
4. Then i optimized the facebook ads based on certain metrics and determined if there were any add to carts/purchases, if no, i turned off
5. But if it's good i kept scaling the good facebook ads - I've scaled a few times and now i'm at the point of retargeting based on add to cart, initiate to cart and purchase

**My results over 5 days:**

\- 13 orders

\- $491 USD in Sales

\- Best day is Saturday (my start day) - 8 sales for $365 in sales

\- Slowest time is now (I'm not sure if July 4th has anything to do with the poor results?)

\- I have a lot of rules in my facebook ads, so a lot of ads were shut off because they spent money and didn't have enough click thrus.

**Pros:**

\- I learnt alot about another online platform to build an e-commerce site. They have an easy to build platform but I think they only have one person in support but he is very good.

\- I learnt how dropshipping works as I was always curious - I've been learning and figuring out Amazon FBA for the last two years and about to launch my product in a couple of weeks.

\- I learn how to do this scaled version of facebook ads and I dug deep and worked my balls off for hours at a time (haven't done that in a while)

**Cons:**

\- I really don't know when I'm going to shut this whole thing down, i want to fulfill my order to customers before shutting down if i do

\- I jumped out of the gate and I felt like not all the pieces of the dropshipping puzzle were given to me. There's definitely missing elements

\- My products were not mine, they are just whoever's product. I had no Brand. I seen some companies actually have a good store name and brand with great following. I feel like this is what's missing and what I kinda am liking Amazon FBA more TBH

\- I lost a lot of money in the process.. the software and the website, etc are a lot.

1. Website: $99/month
2. Software $179/month
3. Facebook ads over 5 days $1088

\-- Total is $1366

I will subtract this total from my profit margin, as I sure am f\*ck not gonna keep it

1. Cost of product, roughly 30&amp;#37; so 70&amp;#37; of $491 = $343

Total of all of this is about $1023.

**Summary:**

I don't think my journey is over here, I found it pretty interesting. I learnt a shit ton. I really want to know different types of dropshipping as this was only method i know so far. While i did lose money, i learnt plenty of invaluable lessons and experience that watching a video will never do justice.  I've heard from a handful of people in RL (real life) that they know people who are winning from dropshipping. So i guess i'll just need to figure it out.

Also, i'm lucky enough that i already have a good paying job, so this money to spend on facebook ads and software for this type of program is ok. I want everyone to be aware when they do this, they will need to spend money and be ok with the possibility of losing money. Dropshipping, like any other business in RL, usually operates in a deficit at the beginning

( I work with small businesses all day long, I know.. they tell me)

IF anyone has suggestions or wants link up to talk about it more, would love some help or to trade talks about something I know like Amazon FBA. I started youtube video introducing my Amazon FBA journey but i'll probably make a video about this too as i think people will probably appreciate this (well i hope).

**TL:DR - Made Dropshipping store, learnt lot of lessons, need to go back to drawing board**

Thanks for reading!

\*\*\*\***EDIT: Thank you for all the responses so far! They've been great feedback.. some notes**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

1. **This budgetary spend I used was on purpose, it was apart of the program i followed. It was meant to mine for Data to find it. There are definitely more cost effective ways to probably do this but i wanted to learn how to do scaling of facebook ads too so i wanted to learn.**
2. **If you have suggestions of youtube videos or programs that you've followed that have worked well for you, i would love to hear about those.**
3. **I am Canadian, in case you're wondering about all the Thank yous! lol**

**Thanks Everyone!**

Update#2:
- Since running this massive campaign, I stopped altogether to see what would happen.  I generated $151 in sales with no ad spend at all. Seems there might be residual or something out there or good seo for my site! Will prob attempt to run ads after my amazon launch which is actually good decent right now!
- FYI, even though I spent a fair amount on Facebook ads, it put me in a situation where I said to myself.. I am doing this and I will figure it out. I can honestly say, I am incredibly comfortable with running Facebook ads, getting good results for my Amazon product and it was worth it. I generated 300 email leads at an average of .50 over 4 days!",41,41,2018-07-05,ECOM,0.03925785515457392,0.870399683713913,0.0903424434363842
ecommerce,What works in e-commerce - based on a meta-analysis of 6700 online experiments!,"This analysis goes through 6700 large e-commerce experiments, mainly from the retail and travel sectors, grouping together common pain points &amp; treatment types performed on websites.

The researchers Will Browne and Mike Swarbrick Jones concluded that '*there  are  two  ways  that  website  changes  can  influence  revenue,  either  by  changing  the proportion of visitors who converted i.e.  conversion rate (CR), or by changing monetary amount each converter spends; \`revenue per converter' (RPC).*'

According to the research, test categories that perform best in terms of average uplift are:

\* scarcity (stock pointers) +2.9&amp;#37; uplift\* urgency (countdown timers) +2.3&amp;#37; uplift\* social proof (informing users of others’ behaviour) +1.5&amp;#37; uplift

dropship,Oberlo or Alidropship?,"I have reviewed both Oberlo and Alidropship and my personal preference is Alidropship. Mainly because it is a WordPress plugin and I am very familiar with WordPress. However, both do similar jobs and as long as you are not picky about which platform they work on,either one would be good for aspiring dropshippers.
Although the one advantage that Oberlo has over Alidropship is that you can try it for free. Both have fantastic resources to help you get started and a ton of success stories you can learn from.

ecommerce,Visitors Not Converting [What's the problem?],"Hey everyone at r/ecommerce, I need your help so badly. 

I work for a e-commerce store built with Shopify and we sell LED lights in Canada.

I run AdWords shopping campaigns, search campaigns and I receive a good number of visitors everyday. It costs me a huge chunk of money overall. Anyway, I am getting people on board. This is first step.

The challenge that I am facing is that people are not getting converted at all. If I don't improve, it can cost me my job too. 

I am not trying to get more traffic from other sources because the new visitors will bounce too. I don't want to spend a lot of money on my marketing until I do the important changes first.

I know there are a lot of things to change and optimize. Where should I start first in order to increase the conversion rate?

Is there any suggestion or advice to target Canadian audience better through digital marketing?

ecommerce,Help converting visitors at ‘Our Locations’ page?,"Hi All, I am currently working on making some changes to our company’s existing site, and am looking for feedback. Our category is fairly unique, as we are a juice/smoothie bar with many store locations that also has our own brand of premium quality vitamins/supplements/proteins. We do sell the products available online in all of our stores as well, but obviously juices/smoothies is our main thing in-store. I did some digging through our Google Analytics and found that (for example) if 1000 people hit our homepage, then about 40-60% immediately go to ‘Our Locations’ page next to find a store, from that point around 70% exit our site. My question is how can we get visitors to stay on the site and convert after visiting Our Locations? Or even get more converting directly on our landing page?

In my opinion, the current site is not set up too well for conversions in general, so I would also be appreciative of any general feedback as well. 

Things I have considered creating are creating a ‘tiled’ homepage with one main banner to buy a specific product, with smaller tiles underneath linking to other products or categories. I’ve also considered adding a ‘spin-a-sale’ type wheel to the page to provide more value to visitors.

Does this mean that faster US wholesalers tend to only accept businesses that are already somewhat established?

ecommerce,Anyone in the Fashion Niche? A few important questions,"Hi  


What are some of the best practices when selling fashion items (particularly women accessories)? e.g. is it better to have long product descriptions selling the benefits and emotions of the product or short ones? Have product images showing the product in use or on white background? Have a lot of images per product or only a few?

  
What I noticed is that most high end brands seem to go for a minimal look with white background images, only a few specs in the product description and max. 1 sentence saying something about the product.  
On the other hand customers know these brands already, so maybe there's no need for them to build trust, emotions etc. On the other hand I keep reading all the time that in ecommerce it's essential to sell the product's benefits, emotions etc.

Not sure if fashion is an exception to that or not. 

This is something that causes me quite some confusion.

Basically, I'm using Shopify with Oberlo to dropship shtuff. I first heard about it 7/3, read up on it, then started 7/4 once I picked the niche and found some items I'd be willing to sell. 

I've tried my hand at affiliate marketing and made about $1k in a year. I think it was fair for the amount of time I put in, but I'm hoping dropshipping will make me money more efficiently. I'm also sick of churning out content. x.X

This time around, I'll be marketing using social media (focusing on Instagram) instead of relying on SEO. Will also try Facebook ads for the first time. I've chosen a niche, but am hesitant to share. I've put in a little over $50 so far on the domain and samples and am willing to spend about $250 more before the first sale.

Please forgive me for how long this is and how many questions there are. &gt;\_&lt;

  
**My Questions:**

1. How important is the description? I've been reading here that you need a couple paragraphs and I'm finding myself struggling to get even 1-2 sentences for each item. It makes sense to have a blurb about each item, but I question the *actual* effects of these descriptions versus the *theoretical* effects on profit. Are we assuming that they have an effect or seeing it? Have you found a noticeable increase in sales? Noticeable enough to make writing these descriptions a priority, or is it okay to focus my time more on building my social media profile adding more products to the store?
2. How many items should you have from the get go? I have like... 25, which I get is really low, but is it too low to launch with?
3. How much did you spend on the logo? I was going to use fiverr, but was expecting to be spending about $10-25. Unrealistic in hindsight, but it looks like this will really eat into my total budget of $300. I found one designer I really like for $45 but... is there another trusty source where I could look for a logo designer, or does $50-100 for the vector file and all sound pretty standard?
4. Is my budget realistic? I chose it based on what I spent on affiliate marketing and the info in the linked post above. The plan is that if I hit the budget and don't make a sale, I call it a loss and move on to better niche. If the budget is too low or too high, I'd rather know now than later so I don't waste money or give up too soon. Time-wise, I can treat this like a part time job. 
5. Are the default Shopify TOS and Privacy Policy statements good enough for dropshipping?
6. Is there anything I'm overlooking? Any common pitfalls to avoid? Here are a few other things I'm keeping in mind or have already worked on so far:
   1. Taking my own photos of items.
   2. Abandoned cart app.
   3. Popup subscriber forms.
   4. Setup Google Analytics.
   5. Social media accounts. (Have Twitter, IG, and Vero.)",4,3,2018-07-08,ECOM,0.06855593621730804,0.9016150236129761,0.02982906624674797

shopify,$12k/mo selling beard care products.,"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Paul Lee of HUSKYBEARD, a brand that sells beard care products.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Beard care.
* Revenue/mo: $12,000.00
* Started: November 2016
* Location: Atlanta, Georgia
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 1

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hi I’m Paul, a 22-year-old Korean American entrepreneur and founder of [HUSKYBEARD](https://huskybeard.com/), a 6-figure beard grooming brand. This was my first ever business and I’ve since sold it. I am now operating another Shopify store with a partner, on set to produce $1M by next year. I also consult and mentor eCommerce store owners on ecomswift.com.

With HUSKYBEARD, the focus from the start was to build a strong brand with beautifully crafted, unique, premium quality beard care products for passionate beardsmen. Our customers and community are men who are passionate about their beards and identify their beards as a lifestyle choice, rather than a grooming choice.

I’ve scaled using Facebook Ads primarily, with some SEO, Amazon, Reddit, and Email Marketing on the side. I’m proud to have accomplished a 30% customer retention rate with this passionate community.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

So here’s how HUSKYBEARD achieved success despite many beginning failures!

Summer of 2016, I wanted to grow a beard with my friend Daniel. Being both Asian, we had a pathetic, pubic-like patch on our chins, after a full month. With ambition, I wanted to explore how much facial hair I could grow as an Asian male (side note, most Eastern Asian males are bare-faced, so I wanted to stand out). Very soon I stumbled upon Minoxidil 5% (or Rogaine) and its application towards facial hair growth. I actually documented my 1 year experience with this ingredient on Youtube, and have had over 2 million people view my patchy beard growth. It’s weird I know. (Youtube link at bottom if you are curious lol)

While I was on this Minoxidil Beard Growth Journey (as they call it), I learned that hundreds of thousands of men had the same desire as me: to grow facial hair. Being a natural born entrepreneur, I decided to execute the idea of a beard growth cosmetic and solve this problem.

I was immediately stigmatised and bashed on YouTube and other popular online forums, and was accused of being a scammer trying to sell “snake-oil”. My reputation plummeted but I decided to go for it anyway. I wanted it to be so effective and prove all of the haters wrong.

So I spent about about $1,000 on this project, read 100s of 30 page clinical studies on hair growth ingredients and the science of hair growth, and consulted with cosmetic experts, regulators, and chemists. Over 1,000 hours was spent on this project. I had a dream and I know how to achieve it.

But one day, a cosmetic legal regulator advised me to surrender this pursuit. This “cosmetic” I dreamt of creating was, under FDA’s regulations, a “drug”. And drugs require over 8 years of experimentation, and over $2,500,000 for it to be approved and ready for the market. I entertained the idea of “skipping this process”, but he told me of a guy who ignored his advice and ultimately had $800,000 worth of his materials destroyed by the FDA, just like that. Without warning, without mercy. That crushed any hope I had left.

I had spent 10 hours, every day, for months, got ridiculed and vilified, spent almost all of my savings, and got “nothing” in return (so I thought at the time). It was hard on me.

But rather than dwell on this “failure”, I took it as an opportunity and shifted from the idea of beard growth, to beard care. This pivot was the most important event that defined my success to come.

&lt;div class=""subscribe""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

After creating the Shopify store, huskybeard.com, in Nov 2016, I spent a few months analyzing successful businesses, reading hours a day, and watching countless Youtube videos on success, all with intense focus and purpose.

To test the viability of the business, I started off with the low-risk business model of dropshipping from Aliexpress. And to my luck and surprise, I was able to find a “winning” product almost immediately.

[Revenue growth by the month.](//images.ctfassets.net/t0pm5m7uku03/4UXdAF5TYQ4kwQwgasm6aC/5b0c404324e54e5d99ce0ed0e6f7ffd7/image_0__2_.png)

Monthly revenue grew from $200 in March, to $2K in June. Problems of course arose with this dropshipping method: very slow shipping times, angry customers, poor retention rate, damaged products upon delivery, etc.

I understood that dropshipping was not the means for creating a long-lasting brand that customers love. So I quit this method, had all my products branded, formulated cosmetic beard oils myself at home, purchased inventory in the bulk, and shipped all orders myself.

The beginning process for this was first ordering only the best-selling products in bulk from Aliexpress/Alibaba, getting them branded by talking with the supplier, and dropshipping the other products. I made sure to ONLY pay through Alipay/Alibaba trade assurance order for security reasons, and gave my supplier strict conditions for the relationship: refund for each damaged good during shipment transit, quality standards and inspection, negotiating wholesale price, etc.

I was also only selling products like Combs and Brushes, so I knew I needed to start providing actual beard cosmetics (aka “Beard Oils). So I purchased $70 worth of my competitor’s products to analyze their products, the feel/scent of them, and their packaging. I understood what it means to have great packaging, and learned exactly how to create a bottle of Beard Oil, right from home. It took about 10 tries, to get the formulation down. Afterwards, I created 3 different scents and hired a graphic designer to create the product labels.

I still to this day don’t understand how I managed to do all of this: marketing, customer service, business operations, order fulfilment, and juggling between a part time job. Working all night until 7AM was very common during these times. It got so difficult managing all of these things, so I finally quit my job (after having worked there for 4 years), and brought in my cousin to help out.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

I knew this was the niche I wanted to get in, so I spent a good deal of time thinking about what kind of brand I wanted to create and who my ideal customer was. Many other competitors in this space were hypermasculine (think “If you’re not bearded, you’re not a man” attitude) and the design aspects didn’t seem very modern.

I decided on HUSKYBEARD because it was catchy, and I thought “everyone loves dogs, men and women alike”, so a husky mascot would be broadly appealing. (I actually think this is why many wives and girlfriends of bearded men purchased from my brand).

I didn’t do any sort of launch campaign at the start, I just rolled the store out and slowly made the site look better and better, while learning everything I could. Thinking now, I made the mistake of consuming information non-stop and not actually taking action. It wasn’t until March that I actually started to acquire traffic and spending money on advertising.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

For traffic and sales, I focused primarily on Facebook advertising. I told myself I would master Facebook Ads first before I touched the other platforms. All the profits I made were immediately invested back into testing and scaling more Facebook ads.

The $5/day ad sets soon became $15/day, $25/day, and even $150/day. But I wasn’t making the figures I wanted to with Facebook ads. I slowly utilized other sales channels like Amazon, Etsy, eBay, etc. and also took on some SEO strategies as well as Email Marketing. With just a month or so of effort, I was able to rank #2 for a keyword that had 10,000+ searches a month and acquired over 8,000 leads through running a free contest giveaway.

As far as my top marketing channels, these were the ones that produced the most revenue:

**1. Facebook Advertising:**

Since I was advertising beard products, it made sense to advertise Facebook audience demographics of men who liked pages related to “Beards”, “Facial Hair”, “Mustache”, etc. These were a bit too broad though, somewhere in the 5 million+. So I “flex targeted” (act of narrowing layers of audiences in one ad set). So people who liked “Beards” AND people who liked (competitor brand). Facebook ads is one of the trickiest to master, and took me over 6 months to get down. This is one of the most requested services from my clients: Facebook Ads Consulting and Managing.

**2. SEO:**

Right from the start of my store, I implemented good SEO practices like writing down alt tags and descriptions and compressing images. I got introduced to techniques (both black hat and white hat) such as utilizing back links and getting “juice” from other sites, like my competitors. I spent some money on optimizing my store (making page load time quicker), and on acquiring backlinks (from packages and guest blog posts, like “Top 10 Beard Oils”. After several months, I was able to achieve 2nd ranking for the term “Beard Comb” which had ~10,000+ searches/monthly. Not bad.

**3. Email Marketing:**

I absolutely loved Russull Brunson’s invaluable advice in DOTCOM SECRETS and his well known welcome series templates and branding techniques. After writing up 5 emails, I set them up from 1st email the lead gets to the last email (in the 5 day series) and gave them a huge discount off of a $100 product. This email series is automated, and still automated to this day and allows the customer to know us better before they purchase something from us. I’ve also setup many different automation series for when customers abandon cart, enter a giveaway contest, purchase a specific product, have not purchased a product, etc. In summary, email marketing is not dead!

In regards to sales and marketing, I would emphasize the power (and profit margins) of branding, and really understanding who your customers are and really catering to them. After understanding who they are, the next step would be to test continuously, and to not fall in love with your product/marketing campaign/etc. Do not get your ego attached. If you’re profitable, keep it going and test for better results. If what you’re doing is not profitable, be quick to revise and make the necessary adjustments.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

Every month of 2017 produced more revenue than the month preceding. Q4 of 2017 was when I had achieved the most sales.

Though the revenue was getting higher and higher, I did not understand the concept of higher revenue not always equaling higher profit. I was just so focused on squeezing in as many sales as I could.

So in the beginning of 2018, I stopped being so aggressive with my front-end advertising, in order to focus more on giving value to my existing audiences (through email marketing and retargeting). I was able to increase my customer retention rate from about 13% to 30% in a very short time. And I only spent about $50-$80/day on advertising, which generated much higher margins. I also implemented an ambassador program where bearded men can receive free products in exchange for video reviews, product selfies, etc. (which can be used as ad creatives and social media posts).

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

This journey has taught me so much about entrepreneurship, business, and achieving goals in general. Any success in any sense comes with a very heavy price, which most will not be willing to pay. I was foolish in thinking that I could live glamorously, after just a few months of making a few grand. Had I splurged in instant gratification, the business would’ve probably failed.

Anything great worth achieving requires you to sacrifice your comfort, your time with friends and family, and many of your hobbies/interests. Juggling between many different things and distractions, while attempting a big goal, is almost never going to work out. Because success is so much harder to attain than people believe. I had so much fun in college, going to parties, chasing girls, socializing, etc. And I dropped all of it (including college), in order to focus with 100% intensity on the growth of my business.

Going against society. Imagine a beardless guy telling you he wants to start a beard grooming business. Crazy right?

Culturally, my Asian parents wanted me to become a doctor/lawyer, yet I dropped out of college...to make beard products. Nobody believed in me. Not my family, nor my friends. I wanted someone to believe me, or someone to be proud of the small little successes I had. I didn’t have any of that. Facing endless discouragement from my loved ones, and going after a dream alone, was definitely the hardest part of my journey.

I’m only 22 years old yet I know my time alive is not long. Last year, my cousin, 22 at the time also, woke up, got in his motorcycle, and was killed in a crash. Just like that. No warning, no expectation; his life was taken away by a careless elderly driver. I know my day is coming, but I don’t know when. This is why I have such an urgency to do all of the things I want to do while I’m conscious and alive. And young. As young as possible.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

The tools/apps/services I’ve used and recommend for eCommerce stores are: upsell/cross-sell apps (like Personalyzer and Zipify OCU), automated and segmented email setup, IFTTT for social media content distribution, a pop-up app for collecting leads and giving discounts (Privy or Zipify Coupon Countdown), and an accounting app that will track your profits (like SimplyCost).

I highly recommend Shopify for those starting out with selling physical products, dropshipping, etc.. I recommend Clickfunnels for those selling digital products, professional services, high-ticket consulting, etc.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

It’s absolutely necessary to rewire and recondition your mind. We are socialized and conditioned to live “normal”, ordinary lives and not achieve great magnitudes of success.

Here are 5 books that have had tremendous impact on business, pursuit of success, and self-growth (no particular order):

- The Fountainhead
- The 4 Hour Work Week - Tim Ferris
- DOTCOM SECRETS - Russell Brunson
- E-Myth Revisited - Michael Gerber
- The ONE Thing - Keller Papasan 

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Here are some lessons and advice that I hope will help anyone reading my story:

- When starting, ONLY listen to those who are where you want to be, or those who are masters at the craft you are learning. Everyone gives their opinion (even me right now), so you need to only give weight to qualified people/sources. It’s very likely your parents/friends are giving you the WRONG advice. Instead, go to books, mentors, consultants, etc. 
- Everything has an ROI to it. And no I don’t mean monetarily. The things you do either produce positive benefit, or negative consequence, in the short or long run. Drinking beers with your friends could have a positive ROI if it means you’re in desperate need for a break and need to loosen up. Contrastly, this could have a negative ROI if it means you’ll be hungover the next day and incapable of any productivity. Choose your behaviors wisely.
- The mainstream narrative is almost always wrong. Not wrong in the sense that it’s not true (although many times just outright not true), I mean that what the general masses think and do, is exactly what you’ll get. And if you want to achieve massive heights, you absolutely cannot do what everyone is doing. You have to be willing to go against your social conditioning and belief systems, and go for what you want and do it all the way.
- The man working smarter achieves more than the man working harder. Working hard and hustling doesn’t always get you results. You only have so much energy, time, and willpower in a day, so you have to strategically prioritize the most important and effective actions, as quickly as possible. Essentially, the 80/20 principle. 
- Starting a business is the best way to learn about business. It boggles my mind that anyone would pay $40,000 for a degree in business/marketing/related studies, and after 4-8 years, expect to be ready to start their business ventures. Save that $40K, learn the education online (which is mostly free), pay money to people who are actually millionaires (and not to business professors who have MBAs yet have never sold anything ever), and be empowered to do it on your own. You’ll learn much more this way. 
- Know your numbers. Use Quickbooks. Know your net costs. Aim for 400% ROI minimal, after all expenses. How much are you making today/this month/this quarter? You need to know this or else you are running in the dark. 
- Do not do it alone. I cannot stress this enough, for your own success and your own sanity, you need to have support. Whether that’s a friend cheering you on when you hit those sales numbers, or if it’s a mentor telling you why you can’t scale your Facebook Ads. Going at it alone, like I did, is extremely expensive, and takes forever.
- Do ONE Thing and do it with all your might. The more cups you have to fill, the less amount you’ll have in each cup. Your focus and time are your biggest assets. Knowing this, I dropped school; quit my job; quit social media; moved into my parents (away from friends and the city life); limited time playing video games, hanging with friends, and dating; and focused SOLELY on my business.

dropship,Email Marketing Techniques,"I'm making this thread in an attempt to diagnose what I'm doing wrong with my email marketing and in turn hopefully help others who have no idea what they're doing. First, I'll just mention my situation.


Having dabbled in drop shipping a few years ago I decided to give it a more thorough shot back in May. Since then I've built up a profitable store with an ROI of nearly 50% with Facebook and Instagram ads targeting the 18-24 age range. 


I have read about drop shipping techniques for years and worked in online marketing I've always seen people reference how important building a targeted email list is. Not just for drop shipping but all ecommerce. Countless times people have said ""the money is in the list"". Therefore, for the first time I have been building a list to go with my store since I started. Once I accumulated over 3000 of them I began designing and building some campaigns. 


I read as much as I could and found that the most popular campaigns include some type of welcome series, abandoned cart series, as well as other flash sale type campaigns sprinkled in. 


After a month of giving it a go, my results have been terrible. I'm not sure if it is a result of the younger demographic, but nothing I do seems to work. As of now, I have one welcome email with a small discount included that I send right after sign up. I have a cart recovery series that has three total emails with the final one being a 40% discount code. I have also done a few emails introducing new products and some other flash sales. Here are the stats of each:


* Welcome email: 19.6% open rate, 2.4% click rate, and 2 orders
* Abandoned cart series: 13.3% open rate, 1.8% click rate (nearly 5% on the last email), 0 orders 
* Sales/Introductions: 10-13% open rate, 1-2% click rate, 12 orders 


My most successful campaign by far has been new item introductions, which I didn't even include a discount for. I personally believe this is a special occurrence because I received 10 orders from a single item that is now my best selling item. It was just a winning product. 


With all this in mind, what could I possibly be missing? I have had people review my campaign templates and ensured they look great on desktop and mobile. Almost all have concluded there are no issues with my layout. They are all very clear and to the point. At this point I am lost as to what I can test or try to improve my dreadful results. 


Any thoughts, questions or concerns would be greatly appreciated. Hopefully this creates some good discussion that myself and others can learn from!",8,9,2018-07-10,ECOM,0.03168927878141403,0.9274019002914429,0.040908850729465485

I am in the beginning stages of starting a niche eCommerce business specializing in luxury handmade pet products.

ecommerce,Anyone provide advice on high ticket sales?,"Hi folks I will be selling high ticket automotive products. My website is more or less finished and I'm now adding products. Link is www.locoalloys.com password is ""awfria""

I want some information on how to sell high ticket items do advertising strategies change? I've worked in sales before but providing services and small sales such as print work.

For a general idea the median price of my items is £500/600 for the lower end and £1200/£1300 for higher end.

shopify,High traffic but low conversion 0.3%. Thought we optimised enough but mistaken?,"Hi all 👋

We launched a few weeks ago and have a lot of success in getting eyeballs to the site. We get about 500 unique per day and growing well. Our focus is on Fortnite (super popular atm) merchandise ranging from clothes to pillows. 

Majority of our traffic is from Instagram / Facebook and getting pages with a quite large following to post links with embedded discount codes. We give influencers 10&amp;#37; of sales which gets their attention but the issue is from the lack of sales we struggle to keep them on our side.

We run Facebook/Instagram retargeting with email campaigns based on abandonment and/or subscribing. The conversions are still low.

We would love to know if we are missing something in terms of an optimisation or questions we are not answering through the page. Oh to note, the products are being dropshipped.

shopify,Bundling products within shopify,"HI All, 

I'm thinking of switching to the Shopify platform, and I had a question regarding product bundles. Currently, customers are able to purchase bundled items on my website that are items composed of other items within the assortment. For example, customers can buy a bundle item that's a monitor, keyboard and CPU as one set. Within the product catalog the bundle is it's own individual SKU. However, customers can also buy just the monitor as a separate item. In each scenario the monitor has it's own SKU as well as the bundle. However, when a customer purchases this item instead of reducing the inventory by one bundle, we actually reduce the inventory by each of the SKUs in the bundle. So if a customer purchases a bundle, the stock of the monitor, CPU and keyboard are each reduced by one. Essentially, the bundle is acting as a ghost item online and in the backend we're actually just working with the individual SKU's that compose that item.  

I've seen multiple bundeling apps on Shopify, but none that address this need. Does anybody know of an app that would support this functionality? Or is there native functionality within the shopify platform that would support this?",2,3,2018-07-10,ECOM,0.022199014201760292,0.9378277063369751,0.039973318576812744

ecommerce,Building Pre-Launch Lists for Guaranteed Traffic,"Most ecommerce businesses fail because they can’t get enough traffic to their stores. They focus on having the coolest products and the most amazing store design, forgetting (or at least neglecting) the most important part – the buyers! That’s a guaranteed way to build a tomb filled with sad, lonely products that will never find a home.

It can be overwhelming to figure out how to turn a product idea into a successful ecommerce store with tons of traffic and sales and conversions and all that fun stuff. But really, you just have to start at the end and work your way back.

**Determine Your Goals**

Throughout this process keep in mind that your goals should be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely. So if your goal is to make $1 million in profit, but you have no plan for getting there, your goal won’t be achievable.

You’ll need to answer three key questions in order to reverse engineer a successful store:

**1. How much profit do you want to make?**

The answer to this question will vary from person to person, but it’s important that you have a specific amount in mind. For illustration purposes, let’s say you realistically want to make $40,000 per year in profit.

**2. How much do you need to make in sales to reach that profit, considering all expenses?**

To answer this you’ll need to know your profit margin – the revenue remaining after all expenses (don’t forget about taxes). You should have a good estimate of expenses and potential profits before opening a store. So if, for example, your profit margin is estimated to be 20% and you want to take home $40,000 per year, you would need to make sales of $200,000.

**3. How many people need to visit your store to make those sales numbers?**
 
 There are two pieces of data you need to know to figure this out. The first is Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). Do some research to figure out the average LTV within your niche. If it’s $50, you’ll need 4,000 customers at $50 each to reach your $200,000 sales goal.

But wait! 100% of your site’s visitors won’t be buyers! So the second piece of data you need is your conversion rate. The average conversion rate for ecommerce stores is around 2%, although that can certainly vary within different industries. Using that average, if you need 4,000 people to convert to buyers, you actually need 200,000 visitors to your store.

So that’s your goal. Get 200,000 visitors in the door.

**Build Your Audience**

The average American knows about 600 people. So even if you get every single person you know to visit your store, you won’t be anywhere near your goal. You’ve got to leverage existing communities and tools to get there.

**This is the key to getting that traffic:** start building an audience months before you launch your store. Put up a “coming soon” landing page that asks for email addresses to start out. Then spend those months growing your list of potential visitors.

There are tons of ways to build an audience, but it’s important to focus on getting the most payoff for the least amount of work. Do some research on potential marketing channels – influencers, bloggers, social media groups, forums, related products or services that might be willing to promote you, etc. Look at what your competitors are doing to market their businesses.

Here’s a few ideas:

* **Get media/influencer coverage** - See my post history for a post on how to get media coverage with zero dollars and zero connections.

* **Reach out to makers of the tools and apps you plan to use in your store** - Tell them about what you’re building and how you’re using their products. Then ask if they’d be willing to mention your store on their website or social media.

* **Create a giveaway** - You can give out a bunch of samples to targeted groups like active bloggers or social media groups within your niche. Or setup one big giveaway using a tool like Gleam to get tons of social media shares.

* **Build pre-lauch buzz** - Once you’ve got a few people on your list, start sharing your process with them. Offer sneak peeks, share new developments, ask for advice. Keep people excited about your business and make them feel like they’re part of it.

You may also want to run ads, collect pre-orders and setup a referral or affiliate program. Figure out which methods will give you the most bang for your buck and focus on those.

Once you get the ball rolling, you’ll end up with two pre-launch lists – early adopters who want to try out your products and influencers who want to share your products with their audiences. Be sure to keep both groups updated throughout the pre-launch process.

**Launch**

It’s totally fine if you don’t get the full 200,000 people from your goal on your pre-launch list. That’s the goal for the entire year, no need to get them all in the door on day one. But if you’re getting little to no sign-ups, you most likely need to rethink your products and/or your approach. Best to figure that out early on instead of after you’ve built your whole store.

The most important thing is to launch to a group of interested people. If you’ve built your list right, you should see a snowball effect as those people visit your store and share their experiences. Create a reward for sharing, like a discount for referring friends, to keep that snowball growing during your launch phase.

Even after your initial launch, you’ve got to keep nurturing those two lists – the early adopters (now buyers/subscribers) and influencers. Send periodic offers and updates to your subscribers and keep building relationships with those influencers.

**Conclusion**

Building a pre-launch list allowed Mint.com to grow from 20,000 early adopters to over 1 million users within six months. Tim Ferris’s pre-launch campaign for The Four Hour Body got him over 200 positive Amazon reviews before release and a debut at #1 on the NYT best seller list. You may not be Tim Ferris, but you can use the same techniques as him to reverse engineer your way to success.",6,24,2018-07-11,ECOM,0.022273968905210495,0.9231057167053223,0.05462034232914448

ecommerce,"Dealing with shitty credit card processors, from someone who used to be in payments","An important preface: I used to work in the payments industry for a company *edit: had to delete name of company in accordance with sidebar, my bad!* so I'm not just some random person who doesn't know what they're talking about. It's been 5 years so hopefully if there was an NDA I signed, it no longer applies (if this post gets redacted, you know why!)

They, and all legacy payments companies, advertise stupidly low rates. These are all ""qualified"" rates -- effectively teaser rates that are used when your customers use debit cards or non-rewards credit cards to pay. You'll never see their mid or non-qualified rates advertised on their site, however, because this is their bread and butter. We made money by teasing that low QR and then hitting people with the NQ on a substantial number of transactions. 

You as a consumer should get straight to the point when you contact any of these companies: tell 'em you're not gonna fall for the QR, ask for all their fees in writing -- basically have them email you a copy of the contract, with fine print, before you continue discussion with the sales rep. Ask for cost plus pricing if you can, and hammer them down to something like cost + 0.05%. Getting competing statements from other merchant service companies is really useful for making them compete to lower the rate to the absolute minimum. 

There's nothing wrong with making a living, but merchant service companies tend to do it by screwing over their clients instead of just being straightforward about the fees they charge. A little decency goes a long way towards making this world a better place, and anyways its better for customer retention over time. 

Caveat emptor, my friends. If anyone has any questions about payments, ask away -- I'm happy to help.",5,4,2018-07-11,ECOM,0.06442593783140182,0.9087775945663452,0.026796502992510796

ecommerce,Have an organization question/advice needed,"Hey everyone

I have a question about organization.  I have a website that sells decals and shirts.   I started out selling custom decals, then added custom shirts and I learned that people dont know what they want unless they have choices.  So now I am branching out and putting designs up on my website so they can pick what they like.  


So I'm trying to figure out how to make my categories look decent.   Should I have a decal category and a shirts category, with 30 or so subcategories in each?  My current (desktop) navigation is horizontal at the top, so I could have them drop down there, or make a 2nd vertical navigation that is just categories.   I just dont know how I should make this look good.


I could even just have categories and each category could show shirts and decals, but I feel like that would look messy.  I have looked places that offer similar things as me for inspiration, but nothing looked good to me.


Any suggestions??

dropship,June/July earnings Report - learn from my mistakes,"Hey Dropship Fam,

Wanted to share my progress as I have learnt a lot from lurking here and other dropship forums. I want to contribute my learnings to this community. Now the real reason you opened this thread:

* **Revenue:** $1,102
* **Ad spend:** $1,787
* **Product Cost:** $758
* **Loss:** $1,443
* **ROAS:** \-76&amp;#37;

**Insight from my FB ads (take with grain of salt as my volumes are low):**

* ROAS &gt; 3 products have ATC to Purchase 2:1
* Products sold &gt; 5 have cpc &lt; $1.20 or below whereas Products Solds &lt; 5 have cpc +$1.50

**Be careful about Shopify apps**

I have the basic shopify setup with wheelio, hurrify and oberlo. There was a time when I kept adding in apps just to help hit sales. Either it was the product popup, consistent add to cart, messenger, etc... There are so many out there and easy to add. If you forget about the trial period they charge you right away. Make sure to stay on top of trial periods as well as realize that not every app will help you hit sales.

**Lesson:**  keep it simple and focus on what is working. Don't keep adding in apps just because some other shops have it.

**Do not buy a course or ecom spy...Just don't. I know you may want to but just don't.**

Yes, I did it. I did not listen to the advice of the people here instead I thought it would speed up the learning by getting into a course. I watched tons of ""gurus"" on YouTube and really liked Franklin Hatchett's material. Although his course is on torrents or free download links, I bought his course to support him. He has great content but his post-course support is poor. All Q&amp;A has to be funnelled to his private FB page  which rarely get answered by him unless you call him out. He said he would release weekly videos to his private group but nothing so far. However, he is  not pushy on private group. Never bugs you to buy more of his stuff which I do respect.

Just understand that Gurus have great funnel marketing system and eventually after buying a course, you will want to buy this app or their particular theme.

Also, I signed up for Pexda and have  realized that 90&amp;#37; of their products basically come from well known stores on FB. You can find the products on your own. For example, go the ""I want one"" FB page and click on ""Info and ads"". That is basically what pexda has. I assumed there would more analysis on ""hot"" products. It seems that they have a list of top FB stores and review their posts/ads.

**Lesson:** All of the content can be learned on YouTube.  Here are some examples:

* FB ad playlist (Flying start online): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ORGK44Q6Aw&amp;list=PLKmKkEoJtB-CWRd4UN0z9ojf4s\_qdqCR2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ORGK44Q6Aw&amp;list=PLKmKkEoJtB-CWRd4UN0z9ojf4s_qdqCR2)
* FB ad setup (This one is in Franklin's course): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3\_QK6XbNtHA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_QK6XbNtHA)

**ROAS is all that matters. Nothing else!**

If the product sells, then keep promoting it. Easier said that done. This is because its a combination of finding the right product for the perfect audience. At first, I was selling musical boxes by looking at shopify store that is now on sale ([https://www.craftsninja.net/](https://www.craftsninja.net/)). The musical boxes sold and it was very exciting that I let it blind me. I sold 30 musical boxes. However, if you look at the ROAS, I was at .8. But I got to attached and did not know when to kill the ad unit.

**Next month's plan:**

I am so excited for the next couple of months. Not looking to make a quick buck as I want to build a long term business. Also, its going to be XMAS season soon.

* Get more detailed about action plan
* Start with $10/day WC Purchase ad sets
   * Create ad sets for age/gender that have highest CTR and cheapest CPC or ATC
   * Run for 2 days then kill if no sale
* Keep Testing products. Do not get attached to the products!

Hope this helps the someone out there! It's hard but stay at it!

I just want someone to be transparent with me as to what sustainable method they choose to make a full time income. 

I’ve looked into most of the popular ways out there, notably dropshipping/shopify stores and SMMA/digital marketing agency (I was really keen on this for a long time) but every time I was motivated to get started and kick its butt there was always a flood of negative reddit posts/blogs/videos about it and how it wasn’t sustainable for the long term or it’s all a lie.

Im not sure if the market for all this is saturated but that’s sometimes a good thing. It means there’s competition, and not everyone is killing it. I know people usually want the get rich quick path, but I’m really in it for long term sustainability. 

I just want something that’s relatively quick (doesn’t have to be easy) to start, earning me at least 1k/month because that’s all I need to live on. And then I aim to SCALE it from there and go off into other ventures.

dropship,So i've just started out....,"I've created a shopify, currently loading products and dealing with the whole site organisation etc. 

I'm trying things out at the beginning, a recurring response to new dropshippers that i've seen on this sub is that you need to learn by doing, so thats what i'm doing. It's not a particularly small niche i just wanted to see how things work and learn from my mistakes, i'd also like to avoid making any mistakes by hearing about those made by yourselves when you first started.

So if you were to advise a newbie, which mistakes did you make when first starting out that were EASILY avoidable, but caused enough problems that you can still remember them?",4,3,2018-07-16,ECOM,0.1054496243596077,0.8580836057662964,0.036466777324676514
ecommerce,How can I turn my small business into my full time job? Explained.,"This is not a simple, one sentence answer so bear with me while I give you the long-story, that’s what you’re here for right? My goal is to hopefully help layout your own plan for longevity. To figure out how to start you really need to start at the end, then slowly reverse engineer your goal. Your goals are different than mine and I believe it was Shakespeare who mentioned “To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles…” I don’t want to define your goals for you, I simply want to explain how I went about finding mine. I believe that much of my success is based on basic common sense.

What’s your goal? I hope you’ll comment below. Mine was to work in the Art &amp; Design field, and to narrow that down even further my dream was to work as an animator for Pixar. Years later I built the Toy Story 3 website, close enough I suppose but as I write this I’ll keep trying for that goal. Once I achieve that goal I’m sure that goal will evolve, like they always do, into a further refinement or revision. We should all strive to keep growing firmly rooted in the foundation we build ourselves through our careers. Once I had defined my goal I began to put in the work to get there, I’m still on the way and will keep learning, refining and revising. Goals, and the journey to get there is ever evolving, when you get that big break, or make a big sale, or even your first sale things start changing. Going back more than 15 years now I was at the top Art &amp; Design school, struggling. I was in Sheridan College learning Illustration I was marked down every time I used the computer, now they teach computers in the first semester. How about that…

My experience with sustainable growth began very early, my first job was for FOX Sports when I was 16. That job was kind of a funny story, I was working at my Father’s electrical business, Carson Electric, and I got a call on my cell. On the other end was FOX Sports, bizarrely enough they found my work (at that point of my life it was really just geeky tinkering) included on a CD for software. The company didn’t ask for, or tell me about the included “Gallery Sample,” but was I was super excited. That was basically the time when I knew I wanted to get into art and design and I committed fully. When FOX called they had no idea of my age, I didn’t even know how to bill them, the questions to ask, how to even communicate in a professional environment. I soon learned through experience those gems of wisdom I needed to excel, and although I’ve made plenty of mistakes, and continue to do so, but I try to learn as much as possible each time I make a mistake. This refinement is what you need to build yourself a long-term career, just as I have done.

Sheridan was hard, extremely hard, I would wake up at 6am most days, drive the hour and a half each way in traffic, learn, come home and work until 2 or 3am and repeat again and again. For 3 years. It was really an endless onslaught of work, but by third year I was more than ready to get out into the market. My work quality was quite good, for a student, and many of the easy ways into my chosen industry I exploited where many of my fellow students ignored. For example, on one side of the studio there was a board that was pretty much collecting dust. This board had contact information and a short brief of Art &amp; Design tasks from local businesses, faculty, and alumni. I abused this board, taking virtually every task on top of my school workload. If I did a job that wasn’t up to the client’s level of expectations I gave them a full refund, if I did a great job I’d often get more work, bonuses, and referrals. While many others worked at bars and restaurants to make a couple hundred bucks a week I simply did the work that I was being trained for, and trained well.

My teachers at Sheridan College were mostly awesome, some I didn’t like but truly respected for pushing me right over the breaking point and forcing me to do better. I was never a gifted, or talented student, my work quality during school was fairly average in the beginning but I always worked hard. Another source of income I found during school was when the school finally allowed us to use computers and students needed full color printing so I checked the in school print shop’s pricing and cut them in half, everyone printed with me, each morning I’d hand deliver high quality prints to each of the students I sold to. By third year I was a great student and I was already a professional Graphic Designer and had knowledge in the Printing industry. While most were trying to figure out Photoshop commands I was talking to printers, learning about bleeds, trims, Pantones, stock, weights, reams, varnishes and the plethora of other terms. My glossary was expanding exponentially.

If you have to work hard, work hard in the same trajectory as your goal.

From there the journey took me to a couple of small design shops, then into agencies and it’s been over 20 years of this, and there’s one thing I can say for sure is that I’ve learned a lot… and hope I can pass it on.

I’ve had the great fortune (and sometimes what feels like luck) to have loved each job, at each small design shop and agency throughout the years, there’s really nothing that I can say negatively about my career, it’s been fun, I really like doing this. The only un-fun, none-fun, funniless? I’m not sure how to say it. That part is that I often get too busy to satisfy every client request. I really want to help in every way and not screw up, but I’m human and you are too (unless you’re an SEO bot, then just do yo thang). It’s difficult to give everyone exactly what they’re after, but if your goal is to try to do that with every product or service you provide then you’re well on your way to a long and sustainable career.

Working with others in the agency environment taught me a ton about how to get along with other people professionally. Whether you are introverted or extroverted you can excel, especially in this generation. Success is not really a function of whether you can get along with people in an office environment anymore, in my parent’s generation you had to, every shade of every collar of every job had you working with others. Introverts have an advantage as we can sit quietly alone and be insanely productive, extroverts have an equal advantage of being able to present their ideas openly and with confidence even if they are not yet fully aware of the goal.

If you want to succeed long-term your goal needs to be to try to get as close as possible to the exact thing your client wants.

To put a little more explanation (and slightly contradictory) to this is that I rarely take on jobs with very tight deadlines, such as “I need it tomorrow.” The problem with accepting tight timelines and promising them is that they’re very hard to hit and your client is often expecting the same level of work as when you take your time and produce your best work. In the Art &amp; Design field it’s extremely hard to rush through a project, you have to have a laser focus and have all of your ducks in a row before you begin. If you can get your clients on the same page as you and deliver exactly what you need it can work out fine, if not you’re going to be one step behind when you should be thinking four steps ahead.

There is a second side to this story, and that’s preparedness, if you can get everything you possibly need lined up before and give your clients a deliverables guide you can do it. Think of it like an Amazon warehouse, Prime members furiously buying products and expecting same day or next shipping of exactly what they ordered. It is an incredible feat of engineering when you think of it but if you can refine each step of your process you can deliver without an issue.

Always be prepared, be clear and give your client a list of exactly what you’re offering and you’re one step closer to that exact thing.

Any job requires the vast majority of your day so if any part of you isn’t fully committed and inspired by the very thing you are trying to do, then stop and refocus. Think sustainably about who you are and what you want to add to the world, it will honestly allow you to spend time with the thing you truly like to do. Complete transparency, it’s 9:45pm and I’m watching a movie while doing this. I love art and design, and helping.

“If you work 8 hours a day, everyday, on your career you will be successful.” – My Grandfather

I received a great piece of advice when I was starting out. My Grandfather said “If you work 8 hours a day, everyday, on your career you will be successful.” This took a while to sink in but when I took it at face value and did what he told me to do I did very well, it’s a piece of advice I hold on to tightly to this day. If you look at current C.E.O.’s work logs they work on average 9 hours per day Monday to Friday, at least 3-4 hours per day on the Weekends and up to 3 hours per day when they’re on Vacation. Take that to heart, just keep working in the direction of your goal. I’m not being paid to write this but it’s immensely helping me understand my own process and the steps I take every day.

A few months ago a potential client contacted me and requested help with retargeting ads and social marketing. I of course obliged as that’s one aspect of what I do for a living so we discussed their product for a while. The client didn’t like the business, didn’t like their product and were burning through thousands of dollars a month on Facebook Ads to sell the very thing they didn’t like, but were doing it just for the money. It was a completely unsustainable campaign based on one product with only one potential niche market that was over-saturated and dwindling. It would be a matter of months before the entire thing flipped over and that person would be back in the wild trying to find the next thing to trick people into buying.

Not wasting time is the current area I’m focusing on, being efficient with everything I do in order to keep the momentum going. As one great designer, and inspiration to me, Paula Scher said “you need to be in a state of play to do great design.” I break up my day, and this changes for everyone, but I start with e-mails and prioritize my clients first, then requests for quotes.

Don’t sell crap that you wouldn’t buy.

That Dropship item from Aliexpress that you would never buy yourself but are trying to get someone else to is a terrible idea. It wastes your time, and your client’s time.

The never-ending revision cycle of business and our lives. The finish line will move, just keep chasing it.

When I launched my personal consumer goods brand, Dawg Grillz I did it because of my dog. He’s a Labrador and I really didn’t like the toys that were out there. The rules surrounding making pet products is virtually wide open, there is no agency out there to prevent someone from poisoning a dog with a product so we are forced to trust the manufacturers implicitly. I wasn’t super comfortable with this reality to be honest, it only costs an extra $0.35/product to source clean materials and have it tested. Some unscrupulous manufacturers don’t really care about the end user so they simply see that $0.35 as an unnecessary expense, and proceed forward.

It’s a great period that we’re going through where designers and manufacturers are starting to really build things they would want for themselves and it’s become a revolution. From brands like Google, and Apple down to the Mom &amp; Pop shops that really know everything about their products and build them with the intention that people will enjoy using them.

Build things that people enjoy using and provide services that people will truly enjoy experiencing.

Revisions are key to a great brand, many potential customers ask “how long does it take to build a website?” The answer for most is fairly ominous, “it’s never done,” just like your business you should never be finished working on it, improving on it, listening to your customer’s feedback and take advice with humility. Customers don’t like people who are hard to work with, they want you to be an easy part of their day and they want your product to improve some aspect of their lives.

When you enjoy what you do, build a great product, provide a great service, listen and apply customer feedback you’re going to do great.

Once you’ve “completed” your first round it’s time to start thinking of version 2.0, or even 1.0001. No matter the case you should always be moving forward, even “failing forward” as Elon Musk says. To give this some context, Dawg Grillz Ballz product 1.0 was a cool toy, I was proud of it and I sourced all natural rubber. I sold out of the product and took every piece of criticism, complaint and comment. Dawg Grillz 1.0 were too heavy, not durable enough, didn’t float, didn’t squeak, didn’t smell that great either, all according to my customers. I noticed these issues as well and was already designing version 2.0, yes, 2.0. Version 1.0 needed more than a 1.1 and I had to admit that. I didn’t give in to my ego if a friend, family member or customer said something negative, I just learned. My goal was to give my customers what they wanted and although they liked the product I didn’t think my first attempt was good enough.

If you leave your ego out of it, or ignore it as best you can, you can move on from small setbacks and focus on constantly improving. If you have to fail, fail with forward momentum so your next version thrives.

Continuing on to Dawg Grillz version 2.0 I checked all of the boxes for my customers, the Ballz floated, they were more durable, they squeaked and one of the best features was that they smelled like Peanut Butter. I killed my ego and let my customer’s feedback drive the innovation.

To wrap things up as this is getting long, here are a few tips:

1. “Only work in the direction of your goal.”
2. “Always try to deliver as close as possible to what your client’s want.”
3. “If you work 8 hours a day, everyday, on your career you will be successful.”
4. “Don’t sell crap, or provide poor service that you wouldn’t use yourself.”
5. “Revisions are never ending, your finish line will move, keep chasing it.”
6. “Build things that people enjoy using and provide services that people will truly enjoy experiencing.”
7. “Listen and apply your customer’s feedback without involving your ego.”

ecommerce,I think a bot is trolling my Shopify store. Please help!,"Over the last two weeks I've noticed some odd traffic on my store and a huge spike in sessions adding things to cart. I looked through the various Shopify reports and noticed that out of nowhere a particular product of ours, one that's never been advertised or bought and is really just a filler product, was being added to a cart \~50 times every day. Our average before all this started happening was \~20 carts in total per day. It was already skewing our Shopify reports, and fearing that it would mess with our pixel data even worse I decided to pay closer attention to what was going on.

I began watching the Shopify live view and Google analytics more closely and noticed that throughout the day we would get multiple ""visitors"" from the same IP at the same time. For example, we might see 4 sessions from this single IP at the same time and instantly we'd get 4 active carts... an hour later we might see 2 sessions from the IP and we'd get 2 active carts. The best idea I could come up with at the time was to just remove the product they were adding to their cart, so I did that but then they just switched over to a different product. I was having days with 70+ active carts and knowing that \~50 of them were fake I decided to install a Shopify app that would let me redirect traffic from a certain IP. I'm still in the trial period of this app and it's working in the sense that this bot (or w/e it is) hits our site and is immediately redirected to a different site, which means it can no longer create active carts but it doesn't prevent it from registering as a session in Shopify so our numbers are still a bit skewed. Here's an example of today's traffic so far... the green is good traffic, the yellow are the redirects: [https://i.imgur.com/j7S94jo.png](https://i.imgur.com/j7S94jo.png)

I've seen solutions that say, for instance: ""Enter your email to add this item to the cart"", but then I would assume, and research seems to back this up, that requiring an email to add an item to a cart could be a barrier to the sale and cause the customer to abandon anyway.

ecommerce,What You Wish You Would Have Focused On Before Launching,"Hey Everybody,

So I am currently in the process of launching my first e-commerce website. I have been doing alot of work, over the past month and a bit, getting everything sorted out. From finding suppliers, to financial analysis to determine financial projections, to designing and writing copy for the website, to product liability insurance and everything in between it has been alot of work. I absolutely love the process of building something from scratch and making improvements along the way. I love testing new things to see what works and what does not. I am extremely excited for what is in store.

I am projecting for my website to go love at the beginning of September. There are a couple of things that I need to get ironed out before I launch. 

When starting a business I understand there is no convenient time to start. It's alot of work to get started and alot of work to run and operate. I know this by sitting down and interviewing over 35 different business owners and entrepreneurs on my podcast..... however that's a story for another time.

ecommerce,What’s the deal with Reseller Ratings?,"So... We used to have a 9.something/10 on Reseller Ratings before we switched to YotPo... around a year later we noticed our rating on Reseller Ratings has been bumped down to a 4.8/10... since then it’s slowly increased but is still only a 5.4/10.

The odd thing is that we have a similar number of positive and negative reviews before.... I calculated the number of reviews myself and on a 5 point scale (which is what the customers rate on.... a 5 point scale) we should have 4.7/5. But Reseller Ratings bases their overall store ratings on a 10 point scale... but don’t explain what the difference is between the 10-point scale overall store rating and 5-point scale rating that consumers fill out. When I looked into what goes into their [algorithm](https://www.resellerratings.com/trust-and-ethics#scores), all they explain is that more recent ratings have a heavier weight to more recent reviews, which makes sense... but still doesn’t explain the difference in between the two scales. We’re not mad about the negative reviews.. everyone has their own experiences and sometimes you just don’t like the company, and that’s understandable! But there’s a huge discrepancy between the amount of good ratings we have and our actual score... 

So we ask Reseller Ratings basically, wtf is going on? And the only answer we recieved was, “well if you pay for one of our plans, we can fix that issue.” 

Maybe I’m just a stick in the mud... but is this not borderline extortion? I don’t know anything about legalities regarding reviews and what not... but that doesn’t seem fair... if it’s not illegal... it’s definitely unethical. 

So thinking that there’s no way this is legal, I found this website [Reseller Ratings Class Action ](http://www.resellerratingsclassaction.com/). Who claims they are filing a class action lawsuit on Reseller Ratings. But there’s no really verifiable information on this case. 

Basically what I’m getting at is how the hell does Reseller Ratings their lack of transparency and basically blackmailing companies into buying one of their plans? Is there anything that can be done? I’m kind of in a “we don’t negotiate with extortionists” mindset, so preferably I’d like to not pay them. Unethical and unfair practices really rile me up, so I’m not happy about this at all. I don’t want to change anybody’s negative ratings, honestly I’m fine that I can’t even generate a response. I just want an honest, transparent explanation of their rating scale and what is bringing down my rating? 

tl;dr does anyone else feel like they’re being extorted by Reseller Ratings? What can be done to address their seemingly unethical practices?",0,7,2018-07-20,ECOM,0.060249220579862595,0.9099496006965637,0.02980113960802555
dropship,3 steps to running a successful drop shipping store,"1. Product - there are many ways to find products. You can choose products in passionate niches or just choose product you can find that are hot on Facebook. Search terms such as “I need this” or “I want this” in Facebook to find products that are starting/already hot.

2. Website - the most important part of a website is the product page. Your ad will run directly to a product page. Having proper apps such as product reviews, sales pop and other urgency apps will increase your chances of converting a customer.

3. Traffic - right now Facebook is king when it comes to advertising. Running effective Facebook ads can convert viewers into customers. Make sure you are testing multiple targets with a single target with low budgets.

dropship,Some beginner's questions about dropshipping on Ebay.,"Hello everyone.
Let me start by saying that I want to sort of “test” dropshipping. I am not aiming at thousands of dollars. Just some beer money for life to be easier since I am a university student.
I plan on listing a few things on Ebay, not a dedicated store with a niche and such.
So, after spending some days reading stuff and watching guides, I have a couple of questions.

* Copyright issues. I won’t be selling licensed products from big companies (e.g. Disney). Should I be worried about random no-name companies taking my profits or even worse, suing me?

* Taxes. I need to read the local laws but I am just wandering, should I even bother or do I need to set up anything?

* How should I manage shipping? If someone from US buys one of my items, and I ship that item from China (e.g. AliExpress) should I just write down on the description of my item, the days of shipping that is written on the AliExpress description of said item? Maybe “add” a couple of days just to be sure?

* I am starting off with a very small amount of dollars. I read that Ebay doesn’t actually pay new sellers until the customer gives positive feedback, or 21 days are past. Is there any way to make this process faster? I don’t want to wait 1 month just to get a few dollars so I can sell again.

ecommerce,"Advice needed...moral dilemma, sold a company and have an opportunity.","Last year, I sold a Shopify store that made $500k in about 2-2.5 years. 

Long story short, the buyer paid 75% up front, and was to pay out the 25% over 6 months. He never paid me and as of Feb ‘18 the final payment was due. He blamed me for not generating revenue but in reality he knew NOTHING about running a business. I told him EXACTLY how I chased sales and was very proactive. He instead sat back and relied on organic traffic. He had 5 or 6 orders and didn’t fulfill a single order...he didn’t get paid from Stripe and his PayPal emailed was entered incorrectly and never reached him. As I still have access to the admin panel, it seems he all but abandoned the site in May. He hasn’t logged in since then.

The site has 2 domains. On Aug 10th, one is up for grabs (no auto renew) and Jan 15th, the main domain is up for grabs.

My question is two-fold... 

1) if I buy those domains, will I face any legal issues?
2) is it immoral?

If I swipe the domains, I will use it towards a new business I have developed that is essentially direct competition to the business sold. The is NOT a non-compete order on our sale agreement.

dropship,How I went from $0 to $25k a month dropshipping,"Hey everyone! Instead of coming by and dropping some random tips, I thought it might be useful to show you a month to month playbook of my dropshipping journey. I started back in January, didn't know what I was doing and lost money. Now I'm making almost $25k a month in revenue with 40% profits. In this post I've attached a screenshot of my earnings every single month since the beginning and will give a brief outline of what I did each month to grow. Hope this helps!

BTW, this is with a niche store (sorry not giving out the link!)

[January - $643:](https://i.imgur.com/080F0mo.jpg) I had no idea what I was doing. I heard about dropshipping on Reddit and decided to try it. Initially I did a free + shipping offer on a baseball cap and I got some decent sales but lost money because of ad spend. Was using Facebook ads only at the time.

[February -$3,000:](https://i.imgur.com/lfMGeo4.jpg) After running the free + shipping offer, people started buying other things on my store. It became clear to me what items people wanted, so I ran single image ads to them and this greatly boosted sales. I also began doing work on SEO this month. That included writing small blog articles, rewriting product descriptions, etc.

[March - $6,900:](https://i.imgur.com/mKfHxoW.jpg) My SEO from the prior work started to pick up so I began getting free traffic from Google searches which increased sales. I also started and Instagram page to build an audience related to my niche that I occasionally promote products to.

[April - $13,200:](https://i.imgur.com/Ux0tgVr.jpg) I was able to double my revenue during this month. My previous job was working as a programmer, so I wrote a complex web crawler that search the web to find me winning products. Saved me tons of time and allowed me to test a lot more products. I found some new winners this way which increased sales. I also began running re-targeting facebook campaigns at this point and learning more about effective advertising.

[May - $18,400:](https://i.imgur.com/BWPqV7U.jpg) I added an upsell app to my store which increased my average order value from $20 to $45. I also discovered a new ""sub-niche"" for my store when browsing results from my web scraper bot. This allowed me to target a whole new audience and product more sales.

[June - $15,800:](https://i.imgur.com/ahH5hRo.jpg) Sales decreased a little bit this month. This was largely because I had recently moved and didn't have a ton of free time to work on the business. Things like being slow to answer customers, not optimizing ads, etc. can all add up to a revenue loss! Totally my fault.

[July - $25,000:](https://i.imgur.com/bbne1Fz.jpg) My best month yet! After a loss of revenue in June, I decided to crack down. I scaled all my Facebook ads up a ton and it didn't end up hurting my conversion cost. I also found another ""sub-niche"" that contained multiple winning products. I think my lesson here was that I was previously too scared to mess with my winning ads, which included scaling. It obviously worked out in my favor when I decided to get out of my comfort zone!

Key Takeaways:  
1. Focus on multiple sources of revenue. I have a lot of sales coming from places like Pinterest, Google searches, my Instagram account, etc. Try not to get caught up in only doing Facebook ads.  
2. If you have a skill, use it. Anything you can do that others can't will get you ahead of everyone else who's doing the same thing. In my case, I'm a programmer and was able to create the product finding bot.  
3. Find winning products. 80% of your revenue will come from 20% of your products! This means you need to find that handful of best sellers that you can rely on to bring you sustainable income. Test, test and test some more. Browse other successful stores to see what they sell.  
4. Don't be lazy. It takes hard work and thinking outside of the box! You saw what happened in June when I slacked off. Keep pushing forward and the results will be endless. I could easily maintain the business spending 15 minutes a day on it, but it took a lot of hours to get there.

I hope this helps! 📷🙂

SEO

Email Marketing

Lead Gen

Funnel creation

Keyword Optimization and more

I have been reading quite a bit of content about dropshipping and I am in the process of starting my first business which might include some dropshipping. Now, one thing that really bugs me (might be a language issue since english isn't my first language) is about the meaning of ""product"".

From my understanding, a product is a specific item, like the iPhone X 64GB Silver.

However, hearing people talk about product in their dropshipping journey made me wonder if they were not actually talking about a product category (like watches, bra, t-shirts...)

So I would like to know, when people talk about how they found a product that sold well or how we should focus on a few key products, are they talking about a specific item or a product category?

dropship,I am looking to get some information.,"Hello, I am currently still in high school and have way more than enough time on my hands and i love spending of free time on my computer.  Since I am already spending at least 12 hours a day I figure I might want to try to make some money and maybe help my parents out a little.

I have a couple questions first. Say I find a something i can sell on Ali Express or Wish. Can I just make a post on eBay instead of making shopify. Money isn't the biggest  issue but i thought if i sell the product, then buy and ship then I won't have to have any up front cost. Or am i completely wrong? I'm also curios if anyone is willing to tell me how to get different product to sell.

dropship,How to set up your Facebook ads the right way,"Hey, everyone!

I see that people have problems with setting up their Facebook campaign and I wanted to share with you a checklist that will help you everything you need to do to set up your Facebook campaigns the right way. I used Google sheets to create an **interactive checklist that contains all the necessary tasks that you can tick/un-tick**. Additionally, there are links to resources (Facebook’s tools, tutorials and more). Completed a task? Thank check it off the list. There's a counter to see how many you have checked and see your progress. 

Here are the task groups:

1. Facebook assets (Page, ad account)
2. Creatives (specs, tool to ens20% &lt; text)
3. Ad copy (links to Facebook’s cheat-sheet, Fatool story packs for ad copy inspiration
4. Facebook pixel events (what you should implement)
5. Dynamic Product Ads ( pixel helper and events you need to implement)
6. Audience creation (the audiences you need to create)
7. Budget 

To use the checklist, you need to **make a copy of it to your Google Drive**! ;)

ecommerce,Opinions on branded product images vs. blank/generic.,"We are a creative marketing agency that supplies custom printed displays to a variety of industries and markets. Our main products are custom printed trade show displays. 

Question: From the client's POV, should the product renderings/images be branded with known imagery (Nike, Amazon, AirBnB), or non-specific with only colorful graphics and images?

Everything we do is custom, so the product images need to get the user to invision their own branding on the products. The goal is to convert the sale of the display online.  All items are custom made and artwork design is done after the initial purchase, or during the quote. 

70% of our revenue comes from custom printed displays. Trade shows, events, and races generate 90% of our sales from being present at the event, so our products speak for themselves in person.

dropship,My experience with CJ dropshipping,"Hey guys, so I've been working with CJ dropshipping to source and automate my store. and I just wanted to share my personal experience working with them for the last 2-3 months.

In the past, I used Oberlo and Aliexpress to source and automate my store. As you all know there are downsides to it such as slow shipping time, difficulty with branding, and most of all, feeling less control over the product you are selling.

I'm going to list my personal reasons why you should consider CJ Dropshipping.

1. Shipping: CJ provides variety of shipping options such as S.F Express, E-packet, HK post, Yanwen, and USPS. I have tested USPS shipping methods to NY and California customers. Honestly it only took 4-10 days (excluding processing time) to reach my customers. That is a huge plus! They also consolidate your package so your customer receives nice one big consolidated package.
2. Branding: So I run a swimwear store via Shopify. As you all know, branding is crucial when it comes to apparel store. I recently ordered about 500 hangtags and PVC zipper bag from alibaba manufacturer and shipped it to CJ dropshipping warehouse which is located in Yiwu and Guangzhou. What's great is that they will put my hangtag on my clothing and repackage it into my custom made package at no additional cost.
3. Customer Support: I think this is the most important reason why I'm sticking with CJ dropshipping. So when you sign up with them, they will pair you up with your personal assistant. You'll be able to chat with them through the CJ website or Skype. They will honestly work with you to solve issues such as disputes, sourcing, branding, fulfilling orders etc.

PS. Agent who is assigned to me is Sunny and she is the very helpful and professional person I've worked with. So fortunate to be able to work with her side by side. Please be respectful to your agents, it is really important to form a good relationship with them in order to thrive.

So that's it! I just wanted to share my story. I'm not sponsored by CJ in anyway.

Check out their website r/[http://cjdropshipping.com](http://cjdropshipping.com) (don't be fooled by the design. It is legit).

Let them do all the sourcing and fullfilling order. You just worry about marketing your products.

Hope this gave some value to you guys and good luck!",16,3,2018-07-29,ECOM,0.05265463888645172,0.9171570539474487,0.030188390985131264

woocommerce,Pricing Model for WooCommerce Developers,"Do you develop WooCommerce sites? We typically build corporate presence sites on Wordpress but several new clients are asking us to build ecommerce sites for them.

We've come up with a pricing model but I'm very curious how you build the pricing for ecommerce sites you develop. Does my model make sense?

We already have a fee structure for those corporate sites, so the store would be an add-on to the company site (In other words, assume we're already building a new WP site for the client. Our questions are related to adding Woo to a site we're building.)

Feel free to answer the questions individually or just post a general comment. Any info would be helpful.

So far, our model is:

1) A Flat fee to build a store with basic features, including one payment gateway, one shipping interface (USPS, Fedex, etc), basic shipping rules, up to 20 items, up to 4 categories, and no product options.

2) Adding more items to the store, in blocks of 10.

3) If they don't have the item data in a format that is ready for us to import, there's a fee for us to prepare the data.

4) Adding features/extensions (additional payment gateways, complex shipping rules, search filters, comparison tools, review tools, etc) for a fee plus the cost of the extension (if any).

I would imagine there are lots of other models to follow: some flat fee, some based on average item price, and others based on features like I've listed here (but organized differently), and so on. Maybe some with higher or lower limits on items, features, etc.

How do YOU bill for WooCommerce (or any ecommerce) sites? Any info would be helpful. I plan to pay it forward in this subreddit and other developer subreddits.

Thank you.

ecommerce,Help with taking product photos of very small products,"I bought a light box off amazon and its amazing but I'm having a hard time taking good sharp product photos.  I have a Canon T3 camera (12.2MP) with the standard kit lens of 18-55mm.  My products are all very small fishing weights and I can't seem to focus the camera well when I have the lens close.  If I move the lens away I get a clear picture but by the time I crop all the blank white background away the image looks fuzzy.

I have 2 thoughts on how to fix this.

1. Buy a new Canon T7i.  This has almost 3 times the resolution of my current camera so maybe when I crop it won't look so bad.
2. I have just started looking at macro lenses, but I really have no idea what to buy.

ecommerce,Sellbrite and other thoughts,"Hello All,

Truth: I'm not much of an ecom maestro. My wife and I FBA lightly and mostly for fun and vacation money. But the little voice in the back of my head keeps telling me to try more. So I wanted to solicit some advice. Here is where I stand, and what I think I want to do.

1) Have Pro FBA account

2) Have business license and all attendant paperwork

3) Have eBay seller account, but not store

4) Have open accounts with 3 wholesalers: Alliance Games, EE Distribution, and Darice Arts &amp; Crafts.

Lately, I have been looking to the eCommerce dashboards like Sellbrite. Sellbrite *seems* to do what I am looking for should I want to expand.

**BUT**

A nagging question lingers: If I link Sellbrite to my Alliance account, have it generate orders, does this mean it is telling Alliance to make that order, pack it, and ship it to my customer for me? Alliance is not a by case distributor, but I would imagine the company would be hesitant to pack 50 individual orders a day for me. How does it handle case quantity, since EE distribution sells by case only. Darice only sells by case as well.

Everything else I have researched tells me the Sellbrites of the world are what I am looking for if I want to move to the next level and play the way I want to, but if I can't resolve or figure this out, it seems to me I have to ship the product to me and then ship it again to my customer. Ultimately, this defeats what I want: for the program to read the inventory of the wholesaler, make my listings current from that inventory, and sell what's available. I don't really want to hold product in home or do the heavy lifting of processing a lot of orders.  What am I missing?",9,5,2018-07-30,ECOM,0.022185450419783592,0.9336268901824951,0.04418766126036644

ecommerce,How do I pick a winning product?,"Selecting the products in your catalog or making your own products require surprisingly similar thought processes to achieve great results. Both consumer packaged goods companies and custom packaged goods companies have flourished, even while the business of retailing the items in brick and mortar stores have become less valuable. I remember loving to go to Toys ‘R Us as a kid, now they’re barely keeping above water.

What happened is a very complex situation, however there were major story lines woven into that situation. As a kid a trip to Toys ‘R Us was awesome, you got to try out new toys and hopefully walk out of the store with a present even though I rarely deserved one as a kid. That experience seemed to have changed, it’s tough when adults like me make broad assumptions about an experience for another, and in this case younger, generation. I think part of that experience I lost as a kid wasn’t yet established.

The Big Box store. These retail behemoths became warehouses for the retail population. Home Depot is basically the only one that “should” look like a warehouse, but recent trips to Toys ‘R Us were simply a Home Depot experience. The products are no longer front and center, useful/testing experiences are not catered to. As an aside, DJI has awesome retail stores, so does Nespresso, they’re both nailing it, more on that later.

Products for retail are easy for anyone with virtually any money to get into. Want to start a business with only $100? You can. Want to purchase $10 million in inventory? You can. Want to build the next \_\_\_\_\_\_\_? You can. The retail, and the manufacturing side has never been more accessible. Even 15 years ago it was a ton of capital to get a brand up and running. I built Dawg Grillz, a brand with a $150,000 valuation in the first year with only $20,000. That’s a 650% increase in one year. My business Creatibly has seen a 351% increase in the past 5 years and as of January-July has increased 100% over 2017.

Shorten your failure cycle until your successes rub against each other.

As a brand builder that’s my job, to build a brand and help it grow. Not every attempt is a success, but the failures are shortening their cycles in between successes. That should be a goal of every business, to not overly worry about failures but to simply to shorten the failure cycle. It’s much the same with anything in life, if you’re trying to lose weight simply reduce or shorten the mistakes you make, maybe the donut should be singular, not plural. If you want to run faster, gradually reduce the time between cycles of not running. It’s an over simplification here but I promise to give up the details. Context is important.

Don’t sell crap to people.

This one should be dead obvious but it’s still not and it blows my mind. Consumers are more than ever able to distinguish between a great product that satisfies or exceeds their expectations or it sucks and Yelp hears about it, and Google Reviews hears about it, and they blog about it. If you try to dupe people they’ll come back, not in the way you want them too, your personal brand will take a hit.

When you receive a product sample or are designing your own, put yourself in the shoes of how the consumer feels. Is it up to your own expectations? If you received this as a gift would you be happy or just “meh…” If you’re marginally on the fence with the “meh…,” it’s time to re-evaluate it. Your product may need Version 1.1 or 3.1 before it’s ready.

Keep refining and putting in the work so that if you received your own product you would be happy.

Death by committee is common, it goes something like this: You’re happy with your brand, your product, your service or any combination and you decide that it would be a great idea if 15 of your family members reviewed what you’ve done. They’ll most likely dislike what you’ve done or give you a laundry list of errors, you’ll never keep up and you’ll most likely become dis-heartened. I’ve been in the consumer packaged goods industry for 15 years, I have seen amazing products hit the trash can because someone lost hope in it, they lost hope when it was ready, when it could have been sold, when it could have made someone happy, could’ve changed the world.

Ego is always tough to leave out of your product, and even a brand you represent whether on a manufacturing, distribution, wholesaling or retailing. It’s important to take the helm of your own brand and be it’s ambassador. Too few people stand up for themselves and their brands that they end up feeling like they’re not worthy of them and lock the doors.

Taking responsibility and being an ambassador for your brand is endlessly important.

When you decide on your brand’s design or the product you represent it’s important to represent that brand to the best of your abilities. Whether it’s simply responding to e-mails promptly, responding to positive and negative feedback promptly, to representing your brand even by the way you act. You will eventually embody your brand and it’s important to put the best, most unique version of yourself out there to represent it. One of my Chinese employees said to me once “If you’re one in a million in China, there are ten thousand just like you.” At first it was kind of offensive at face value, but when I asked him more he said that even if you are incredibly unique there are thousands you can relate to.

You are going to become your brand, you may as well love what it stands for.

If being straight laced, suit and tie wearing, shoes polished kind of business person there is a huge market. If you’ve died your hair purple and wear a mask there is a huge market for you too. With how connected we’ve all become it’s easy to see how unique our market has become. 40 years ago, you could choose between laundry detergent one, or number two. Now I can get laundry detergent that meets my specific niche. I made a valuable, original, unique business from a ball for dogs, you know how many balls there are for dogs? Usually less than two if you’re being a responsible pet owner ;)

“If you don’t know where you’re going, any road’ll take there.” – George Harrison

You may ask “what does this have to do with me picking a product?” Well, it’s simple, you don’t have to follow a trend, try to predict a market, try to guess what kids will be into three summers from now. Think small in community, think you, think about what you would do, or what you would want to buy and there is a market for it. You’re not alone, you don’t need to appeal to the masses in order to be successful.

When I speak of success, I speak of day to day, sustainable success. It’s always better to swing high and miss, than to swing low and hit. You may as well be on-board with your own brand. You’re hopefully going to see your brand grow every day, and evolve constantly, you’re going to be responsible for its successes and its failures.

Think about the logistics of your brand.

I have an old house, come to think of it I’ve always lived in old buildings. With radiator heating and window air conditioners peppered around the windows. Do you know how hard it is to find a window air conditioner that actually looks nice? It’s friggin’ impossible I tell you, the ones I have are by a top brand and work great but they completely suck from a human interaction and visual appeal stand point. They’re noisy, but air conditioners have to be, you know, mechanics and what-not.

Here’s why all window air conditioners look like shit, logistics. They’re heavy so they need a monster of a box to carry them, that box has to absorb test drops as well. Logistics comes into play with how cubic meters are shipped, by the cubic meter. Typically weight doesn’t have a ton (pun intended) to do with it when shipping large quantities, sure if you’re shipping a cubic meter of lead it will generally be different than feathers, but when it comes to products people use it’s generally not that vast a difference. So the air conditioner manufacturer has to design something that is efficient and powerful in a small space so design and interaction move way down the list of items that need to be checked.

This lack of design and human interaction considerations has effected the price, each time I’m in a big box retailer or shopping on-line air conditioners are in a race for the bottom. If all of the products in a category are generally terrible then price is the only concern. This is how your product becomes a race for the bottom on pricing. These manufacturers have decided that $300 for an air conditioner is expensive, and they mark the price down to compete because the products are the same. Then consumers walk out of the same Best Buy store with a $1000 phone. I hope this is coming clear, if you leave out original, unique answers to product questions you only have price to differentiate yourself. If you build something, or partner with someone selling something unique and can connect with your audience you will have a great business on your hands.

Being unique will allow you to avoid the race to the bottom on pricing.

Connecting your product to its market is the priority for any product, and doing so has never been easier. Depending on your budget you may have to order smaller quantities, maybe one at a time, if this is the case then there are numerous manufacturers in various categories, think custom anything. The greatest feature of this new custom economy is that custom products are incredibly popular.

One of the industries that rooted itself in the custom consumer packaged goods market is also one of the largest, the cycling industry. As a consumer you have been able to build a custom bicycle for the past decade. Never has a bicycle been more expensive, the industry has seen a near exponential increase in product cost, it’s easy to by a bicycle for well over $15,000 and it’s common to virtually any brand. There is a market for a $15,000 bicycle, a huge one in fact. I used to race years ago even up to the National Level and it was incredibly fun, I used to race on an $10,000 bike, and even at my level I didn’t need it, it was too much bike, the only reason people bought these was that they were the best of the best for that time.

Having a unique, customized, and high quality product offering will put your product in a category where the customers will be more demanding of quality but also less responsive to pricing considerations.

Here are some tips on picking or creating your product or brand:

1. “Shorten your failure cycle until your successes rub against each other.

2. “Don’t buy, or sell crap to people.”

3. “Keep refining and putting in the work so that if you received your own product you would be happy.”

4. “Taking responsibility and being an ambassador for your brand is endlessly important.”

5. “You are going to become your brand, you may as well love what it stands for.”

6. “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road’ll take there.” – George Harrison”

ecommerce,Bing Ads account closed for no obvious reason,"Hello you wonderful peoples.

I've recently opened an e-commerce business selling to a specific audience. I've heard search engine ads were the way to go for sales, but I'm also interested in branding, so I've been doing some Facebook ads (to little success).

But anyway, the story goes, I sign up for Facebook Ads and Google Ads around the same time. I set them both up, get the first (horrible) set of advertisements out, then eventually reconfigure them. Shortly after that, I set up Bing Ads and directly import my ad information from Google Ads. One gym session and snooze later, I wake up, go to work, get back, and what-the-hell, my Bing Ads account has been locked.

So, I contact their support and get connected to this fantastic support guy. He explained to me that they needed to verify my account with some more phone-given proof. Stuff like the exp. date on my credit card as well as the last four digits, and of course my name for the account (I used an alias to sign up for the account, but obviously had to use my real name for the credit card).

My support guy lets me know he expedited the process of whatever-the-hell-they-do, and I got an e-mail saying my account has been reviewed and subsequently permanently closed. ""For what?"", you may ask. The interior of the message was:

*"" For privacy and security reasons, we cannot provide details around your specific account closure, but the most common reasons that require us to close Bing Ads accounts include:*

*The payment method on file was not authorized by the account owner.*

*The account was accessed without authorization.*

*The account is related to an account that was previously closed.*

*The account was determined to be high-risk to other customers or advertisers, as stated in our Editorial Guidelines.""*

As well as some statement saying they weren't obligated to release the actual reason my account was closed.

So, here I am. Has anyone else had an experience like this? It's really very bizarre. I thought I filled everything out correctly, but they still closed my account for (as far as I'm aware) no damn reason.
