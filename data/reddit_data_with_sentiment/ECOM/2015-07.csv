ecommerce,How I can increase my conversions! Suggestions welcomed.,"Hi /r/ecommerce,

I've got my site up www.evergladesoutdoor.com ; had a sale within the first week and a few ""added to cart"" and others reached ""checkout"" but didn't actually finalize. I reached out to a few view email and just never heard back.

I need help in determining what to do next. I have made a few changes with colors and layouts and placement of products but am struggling on knowing what to do next.

If it helps any, I am receiving between 50-100 visits per day at this time.

ecommerce,Merchant account fees and several ecommerce stores on 1 account.,"I am in the process of launching 2n ecommerce project and need merchant account for it.

We've been using authorize.net(gateway) + chase paymentech(merchant bank) for the first project. Authorize.net experience is solid. 
Wondering about paymentech fees we are paying though. 
Here is our last merchant statement:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61690214/merchant/fees.pdf 
Does it look about right? 
They have some strange internet fee $15/month?

For 2nd project we have 2 options: opening separate merchant account or using same one for both projects.

When opening our first ecommerce store, chase paymentech rep. convinced us to use website name as account name instead of company name. His reasoning was - less confusion, less chargebacks, etc.

So now we are debating on opening separate merchant/auth.net account or using the same but changing account name to compamy name.

Here are samples name to understand better:
1st store - bestbabyclothes.com. 2nd store - chicagotours.com (travel niche;). Company name is Quality Shopping Inc.
*all sample names;)

Won't it result in customer confusion when they made order on one site and see Quality Shopping Inc. when checking their statements vs seeing the domain name they ordered from? 
Using same looks like cheaper option, but my concern that it can result in confusion. 

Ecommerce people please advice.",4.0,4,2015-07-02,ECOM,0.0488228015601635,0.9272750020027161,0.02390224114060402

ecommerce,Generate a Max Income From Personal Men's-Wear Collection With Ecommerce Store [Case Study],"SÕNNET.COM Innovative Used Cloths eCommerce Portal with Extraordinary Functionalities . [Case Study](http://innomindtech.com/case-study/)

Make Max Income For Ur Products With eCommerce Store. Double the revenue.

Customer Profile: 
Industry: Ecommerce
Language: English
Audience: Any online user

Project Overview: 

SÕNNET is a curated space created to help you generate income from your personal menswear collection.

The Problems that we need to find innovative solutions:

SÕNNET owners needed to create a product that allows any online users to create their very own online wardrobes to sell their used clothes to any people around the world with host of features like advanced search filter option, buyers – sellers messaging platform, making an offer to negotiate with the seller,payment gateway integration to purchase the product directly from the individual sellers on the platform.

The Challenge :

User Experience -

The website needed to build a completely different user experience for the
visitors/customers. Developing the entire UI/UX for the site to ensure
maximum customer interaction on the platform.

image
Large Customer Base -

Since the portal is very innovative and very usable to sell used cloths, a
large number of user activity was expected. The challenge for us to create a
resilient website architecture that could handle a large customer base and
the products data.

image
Payment Gateway Integration -

To Manage transactions between buyers and sellers directly on the
paypal, that requires in-depth R&amp;D to integrate with the platform.

image
Offer Management Module -

Integrating the offer management module in the app was a challenge
as it required multple ajax loading.

Search Engine Friendliness -

In order to promote the site on the target online channels, and
increase the visibility of the website, the website need to be search
engine optimized (SEO) capabilities integrated with the CMS.

The Innovative Solution offer:

AJAX -
An AJAX-based product search filter and messaging section was
built for the portal and it met all the technical specifications.

Responsive Web Design -

To enable website content across multiple mobile devices, we
developed the website in responsive HTML. Used HTML5, the design
proved to be future proof to a large extent while maintaining
consistent UX, irrespective of the device being used.

Paypal Payment Gateway Integration -

Custom code was written so that Paypal API services could be used
to manage transaction directly between buyers and sellers on the
platform. Some customized paypal APIs were also introduced to
customize the paypal payment gateway.

The Result :

InnoMind Technologies delivered SÕNNET on time to the client and
during the Beta Delivery; the platform attracts people to list their used
cloths to sell online. The partnership with InnoMind Technologies
ensured that the final product was: High Quality, Delivered in timely
manner, Developed Cost efficiently. In alignment with the client needs

I have 1 product to sell, intentionally for starting out. Im trying to keep costs low til I know if this is a worthy venture to invest more in. My goal was to initially start out selling on etsy, ebay and what ever else such as retail head shops, marijuana related product. I wanted to keep costs low by skipping a personal site, but then I heard that you could basically setup a almost free ecommerce through blogger.com. I like those one page sites, [such as this style](https://worthy.am/), and given Im only offering 1 product atm, I figured that kind of site would be perfect for getting started. 

I downloaded a few blogger [ecommerce templates](http://www.bloggertemplatestore.com/catalogspot-revo-blogger-template-demo) and they are close in style to what I want but I feel like Im searching a cave with a match trying to figure out where to go. Im lost and have no clue how to move forward with anything else. By everything else I mean everything from the shopping cart, the 1 product page detailing the product, about and any other page that could be useful. Is there a site with info that says ""do this and do that"" to get me past where Im at? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

My cheesy site, all the images are just something I threw in there to give me a idea of what to expect.

ecommerce,Looking for a ground-up webchat/ticketing system for startup,"Probably not the most appropriate place to gather such info, but I thought maybe you might have some experience with this as well... (x-post from [/r/sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3c8j37/looking_for_a_groundup_helpdeskticketing_system/) )

Hey guys (and maybe gals),

I've been searching for a ticket management platform and helpdesk organization tool for a new company, but I haven't had much luck. There are so many options out there, all with different features. Some useful, most aren't.

Some of the must-haves:

* web chat integration (on-site or off-site)

* screen-sharing or co-browsing (remote control optional)

* scalable

* brandable

* SSL capable

* file sharing

* customer queue

* agent queue

 

Some of the niceties:

* standalone client for agents

* multi-OS and mobile support

* cloud hosted

So far, the leader of my list is [LiveZilla](https://www.livezilla.net/features-table/en/), but it is an on-premise server, though I could use a VPS or dedicated host in the cloud, but that's an expense that's not really feasible in the short term.

I was hoping there might be some thoughts or experiences floating around out there on some other options, even if that includes multi-vendor pieces.

I have considered separating the ticketing, chat, and remote services between multiple vendors. Things like SpiceWorks helpdesk, PHPLiveChat, and join.me could cover my needs, but it is just a clunky and complicated system.

There were a few other more complete solutions, but the costs per agent were ridiculous for a company in my current position.

Getting really worried. I buy a lot of my traffic from google etc. And my site is relatively new, only been running it for a few months.

ecommerce,Analysis of E-Commerce Customers,"Thanks for reading this post.  People wanted more on e-commerce, here it is!  (At least I hope.)

I’ve been thinking a lot about e-commerce since I founded my company.  As part of that, I wrote this to clarify some of my thoughts regarding the types of consumers and their view of e-commerce and the use of the Internet in general.  This is the first part of a planned two-part post.  In the second one, I intend to use this same framework to examine how the consumer types I’ve identified below affect the strategies that businesses use.  


Introduction

In this post, I identify three groups based on their use of the Internet and e-commerce.  People are Never’s, Maybe’s, and Always’s. A Never rarely uses the Internet for more than the most basic things and is often uncomfortable with online media.  A Maybe uses the Internet for multiple things, often business related, but may lack a sophisticated understanding of the medium. An Always defaults to the Internet likely has a sophisticated understanding of it, and strongly prefers to shop online.  Movement is possible from one group to another. I have lastly further identified a sub-group of Always’s that I call Evangelists. For each group, I will examine some of their traits, their use of Social Media, their online shopping preferences, and how they move to the next group. 

Never’s

The first group is Never’s.  This group, as the name implies, almost never use the Internet.  Typically this group is older and can largely avoid using the Internet by choice.  They may use email, conduct research online, or read the news.  This group is likely not comfortable with new technology and, as a result, may ignore it or dismiss it as a fad.  They do not understand technical aspects of the Internet, such as cookies. 

They are largely absent from social networks.  If they do use social networks it is either in very limited capacity or networks that are not optional, such as a corporate CRM system.  Even then, they will typically fight against using these systems.    They may be comfortable with legacy software that is long established in the market, such as corporate accounting systems or Microsoft Word. They have no exposure to most social networks and will be unaware of them or discount them out of ignorance.

This group does not shop online if possible.  They may do some research online, but will typically make a purchase decision in person.  They value being able to touch and feel something more than convenience. When they do shop online, they do so only grudgingly.  They want to talk to a real person and touch things than they are going to make a purchase.  They stick with brands they trust.  If they do shop online, they are not conscious of the subtle clues that indicate trustworthiness and professionalism.  

In general, Never’s feel they don’t need or want the Internet. Ironically, this attitude and lack of familiarity can make Nevers easy targets for simple add strategies.

Ironically, Never’s can be quickly converted to Maybe’s when the situation is right.  The most obvious is their kids post photos of the grandkids on Facebook, so they instantly find out they can not only use Facebook to see the kids, they can talk to their friends and make comments!  Other cases may be they need something that can only be found online, such as vintage tractor parts.   They may retire somewhere with fewer services and, therefore, find that e-commerce is convenient. Over time, they become more confident.

Maybe’s 

Maybe’s are the vast majority of people today.  They are typically indifferent between online and offline shopping, media consumption, and other services.  Maybe’s are the most diverse group with respect to their understanding of and fluency with technology.  Maybe’s are comfortable with mainstream technology but aren’t pushing the limits.  Maybe’s overall take a conservative, practical approach.  They aren’t looking for new stuff but won’t reject it if they find it, and it works for them.  

They are typically active on at least one social network but are more likely to remain within the confines of Facebook or LinkedIn.   They are perfectly capable of working with a wide variety of different systems.  They may not have a deep understanding of what is going on, but if it works for them it is not a big deal.

Maybe’s can be extremely proactive and sophisticated for business reasons.  They may not care about Twitter or another social network personally, but if it helps the business, they are happy to learn all about it. If the case can be made, a Maybe will go along with it.  They may not push the limits, but they are along for the ride if it works for them. 

With respect to e-commerce, Maybe’s are brand focused or need to be lead.  They are not terribly interested in new things, but if it works for their friends they will try something.  Maybe’s are happy shopping from established retailers who have a web presence they know.  They may not be conscious of why they do or do not trust a website, but when they don’t trust it, they will simply not buy there.   

Maybe’s can become Always’s with increased familiarity, good experiences, or life changes.  As they are willing to substitute things, a positive e-commerce experience will lead to greater confidence over time and a greater willingness to move more of their commerce online.  

Always’s

Always’s are the most technologically progressive group.  They have a firm grip on new technology or the ability to quickly get up to speed on it.  They strongly prefer online retail to traditional retail.  They typically have a good, solid ability to harness the technology they use to maximum effect.  An Always will default to an online solution first and exhaust online options before checking offline solutions.  

An Always will typically be active on multiple social networks and be quick to integrate new ones as well.  They understand what different networks do and why they should care about them.  An Always may be active on at least one network outside of the mainstream.  

With respect to e-commerce, an Always prefers to shop online. They see traditional commerce as dated, inconvenient, and limiting.  They understand that many brands don’t manufacture themselves, and therefore they are skeptical about what they are paying for.  An Always, for instance, does not need to be told why www.everlane.com is a better option than Banana Republic.  When they hear the story, it becomes self-evident.    An Always can quickly evaluate the trustworthiness of a site based on conscious or unconscious clues, such as dated design.  They are plugged into new information and can quickly evaluate, research, and make decisions.   

A sub-category of the Always is the Evangelist.  Like the Always, the Evangelist is tech-savvy.  The Evangelist believes that you should be doing more online, no matter what you are doing today.  They are constantly pushing the boundaries to see what works and what doesn’t.  The typical Evangelist has usually had a personal experience that brought them from an Always to an Evangelist. 

Conclusion

This post shows that we can classify people into three major groups.   As discussed, the Never’s are least sophisticated and least likely to use e-commerce, the Maybe’s are more sophisticated but largely indifferent in their usage while the Always’s strongly prefer e-commerce.  Certainly each group likely has many sub-categories, such as the Evangelist that I identify.  It is clearly possible to move from one group to another though I believe these moves to be one-way and towards the Always group.

ecommerce,My e-commerce customer acquistion is driven entirely through Tumblr,"Hey guys, I thought I'd share my story because I feel like tumblr is actually an amazing, underused platform for getting new customers. A great example is Blackmilk, who started out just posting pictures of cool leggings before starting to make them themselves.

I am an American who is in the process of immigrating to Canada; I also went to school here so I have a lot of unique insights about the differences between the two countries. They say to ""write what you know"" so I started a tumblr called [What's Different in Canada](http://whatsdifferentincanada.tumblr.com). I sent out pitch notes to a few journalist who cover ""quirky Canadian things"" and it got picked up by the National Post and Huffington Post Canada. 

I continued to post high quality original content on a daily basis and eventually amassed 60,000 followers on Tumblr. 

My wife is a graphic designer, so we launched [a line of T-shirts based on one of my most popular posts, House Hippo](http://househippo.ca). For you non-Canadians, *House Hippo* was a public service announcement from the early 2000s that depicted a tiny hippo that lives in your home. The goal was to teach children media literacy, but it ended up convincing kids across Canada that house hippos are real, so our shirts are a parody of that. 

Now whenever I have a popular Tumblr post (500+ notes) I will insert a soft sell for the shirts in the post, and we always get a bunch of orders. Naturally I collect e-mail addresses and use e-mail marketing as well. 

Results: We have now sold House Hippo shirts to every province in Canada, there are people walking around Vancouver with a picture of our cat on their tank top, and we have funded 3 vacations (including our honeymoon) and get to work on something we love on the side.

ecommerce,Anyone else noticing weird things with 3dcart this week?,"First, I apologize if this is the wrong sub for this but I got encouraged by the ""shot in the arm"" post.

I've been using 3dcart for my storefront since Dec. 2010. It leaves a lot to be desired but I know how to use it so well at this point that moving to another host would be too much of a pain.

This last week my batch price editor function stopped working and started going to an error page. I sent in a support ticket which went completely ignored for 36 hours (very weird, as I've had plenty of support issues over the years and they've always been really fast, like a matter of hours). 
Then I called tech support and opted to be put in line for a callback (in position 8). Hours later, still no call back, so called the sales department. Quick and easy to get someone on the phone there! They claimed everything is kosher at 3dcart and were able to put us through to a tech person, who said they would ""expedite our ticket."" 

I received an email from tech support verifying what I'd said in the first ticket and then asking my permission to test the price editor. :| I said sure, no problem. That was Friday. I let it go because of the weekend/holiday.

Monday, still nothing. I reply to the ticket twice with no response. That night I called tech support again, same thing, in line for a call back, no call back. Call sales. Get put right through to a tech person, who says they'll expedite our ticket. Get a reply thanking us for our patience and telling us we'll get a reply within 24 hours. That was Monday. 

So here I am now (Weds) with no reply within 24 hours.

I remembered I have another 3dcart store that I keep (but don't actively use) and the price editor function isn't working there either. So I guess that's comforting. But I'm amazed I can't find any posts anywhere in the last week that other people are having problems with tech support, if not my specific issue.

woocommerce,How to let seller device shipping costs?,"Hey

I'm building a woocommerce shop/ordering service, and it's almost ready...but I stumbled upon a really bad issue. Apparently shipping varies to this firm depending on who buy. If one purchases often items, then they might get free shipping. As a counterpart, if someone orders just one item, of course he has to pay the shipping.

The firm would like to decide this shipping cost separately for each order, is this possible?
Right now, customer picks items, and presses buy. This sends the offer to wordpress front-end to the firm. The customer is then asked to pay for the items to a certain bank account.

Could it be done that I could disable payment, and the seller would contact the buyer via email when the seller knows the shipping costs? Making it from a shop to a more like, ordering service.

shopify,Need to vent: Why is there such a huge jump in price from Basic Plan to Unlimited Plan?! :(,"My company is willing to pay more for more options of course, but not $150 more a month!! That's a 600% increase!

Figuring out shipping rates has been a nightmare. We don't make enough to move up to Unlimited Plan so that we can have carrier calculated shipping, but we keep losing money by applying rates manually, often underestimating, and angering customers when we're obviously overestimating. Plus, our customers want to see the accurate shipping rate when they check out (we sell to other companies, not to individuals, their accountants like accurate numbers). Not to mention the man hours it takes to continue to update shipping rates. That costs money too, and we lose production time. They can be doing something else instead of researching shipping rates and typing away at a desk. 

We have a UPS account, and customers call in to make orders all the time. We punch in the numbers, and BAM, right away on the computer screen you see the 100% accurate shipping rate. We tell the customer the rate, and process payment. Simple as that. Customers that have been doing it this way for years have attempted to go on our website and purchase products online, but they are not happy with the shipping rates. They think we're charging too much, rounding up, suspicious of the totally even number: ""the last two times I ordered this product, it was $53.71 and $54.08 for shipping. But now it's $60 even? You trying to rip us off?"" The company ordering from us in El Paso now pays the same rate as the company ordering from us in Houston, because we set rates by state, even though they're far apart. We have too many customers and not enough time to set rates by every zip code in the country. We have lost money and customer trust. 

We're ready to close our Shopify account and just have a brochure website, and have customers call in to place an order... :(

ecommerce,Flipkart Turning App Only From September,"Flipkart Turning App Only
Flipkart announced recently that it will soon become app only. Flipkart, India’s largest online ecommerce store, said that it will be available only on apps from the month of September. Flipkart turning app only seems that it is following the footsteps of Myntra, a site owned by Flipkart, which turned app only just a couple of months back.
 
However, the announcement has given a huge rise to a controversy whether Flipkart turning app only will be able to run as smoothly as it becomes mobile-only. Flipkart plans to eliminate its desktop website version entirely. The step taken by Flipkart to become app only came as a rude shock to the users who will now lose the comfort of surfing the ecommerce site from desktop.

The transition from website and mobile-first site to just mobile app is a huge step towards future. After Myntra became app only, it was announced that desktops and laptops will, in near future, be replaced by mobiles. Thus mobile devices like smartphones and tablets will be the main digital interface in the future. This was one prime reason for Flipkart turning app only.
Flipkart Turning App Only From September
Smartphones and tablets has made a major impact in the life of users. So much so that almost 30% of the internet using population browse the internet exclusively from their mobile devices. However, it is still early to predict that mobile devices will replace desktops and laptops.
India has an increasing population of internet users. The number of smartphone users too have gone up considerably. However, the number of desktop users still remains the highest for internet browsing and online shopping.
The number of online shoppers in India is quite low as compared to the leading online markets like UK, USA etc. However, it has been rising at a great speed with around 6 million users adding to the online market each month. This statistics has lead to the ecommerce giant’s plan to shift to mobile only version.
However, the Indian market is not yet ready to move from website to app only. The slow internet connectivity and absence of mobile internet facilities throughout is one major drawback for Flipkart turning app only feature.
Its still unsure as to what will come and how far users would perceive and accept the app only feature for their online shopping solutions.",0.0,1,2015-07-09,ECOM,0.1518775224685669,0.8214414715766907,0.026680992916226387

ecommerce,Shopify vs Amazon AWS,"I've done a comparison of an e-shop running on Shopify and an e-shop running on Amazon AWS. Correct me if I'm wrong.  

&amp;nbsp;

Shopify Basic: $29 / month + (2.9% + 30c per transaction)  
Amazon AWS t2.micro with Paypal: 31 * 24 * $0.014 + 1 * $0.10/GB= $10.51 / month + (2.9% + 30c per transaction)  

&amp;nbsp;

That means Shopify is only about $20 more expensive in this configuration than an equivalent Amazon AWS instance, where I'd have to take care of everything. With the Starter plan the difference is only about $3.

Unfortunately, it seems that none of these actually allow me to create a variable product landing page, there seems no plugin (or theme) geared towards taht, and in the end you always have to make a stop at the product page in order to select variables.

shopify,Selling different quantities at different prices a piece.,"I'm setting up an online store for my dad, who's expanding his business to opening online as well. The thing is the products we're looking to sell vary in price depending on the quantity, and if you buy 200 products, it becomes considerably cheaper than 100 products, each product drops a fair bit in price too.

I have it set so that it's a variable, like color and size, but then it only shows the total price, and not the price per item at that particular quantity.

Is there any way to make sure that Shopify displays the price as: 

211,- per product, 21'100,- total, if you buy 100.

then you upgrade it to 200 and the price becomes

183,- per product, 36'600,- total, if you buy 200

...or something alike?

EDIT: Mostly solved, currently the starting variant for quantinty is called ""choose quantity"" and the price of the variant ""choose quantity"" is the price of one at 100 products in bulk. Then the customer can choose the quantity and the price changes after that :)",3.0,1,2015-07-10,ECOM,0.05074074864387512,0.9202576875686646,0.029001548886299133

shopify,How to start Facebook Dynamic Retargeting campaign | Shopify store owners only,"Hi there 

This year, Facebook released a new feature called “Facebook Dynamic Ads” that lets brands and retailers dynamically promote their products on Facebook, targeting the users who have already visited their website, but haven’t made a purchase.

**How it works:** 

* A user visits your product page but doesn’t make a purchase
* He/she goes to Facebook to check out their timeline
* Facebook campaign re-engages the user with a dynamic ad encouraging them to come back to your website
* The user returns to your website and makes a purchase

If you show interest in the new feature, Facebook will refer you to contact your developer to set up pixels or one of their Facebook Marketing Partners as setting up and managing Facebook Dynamic Ads is a challenging task that requires involvement of a developer and a good advertiser.

If you think it’s another Facebook Exchange feature available only to third-party developers… **You’ll be wrong.** 

I've started [Retargetapp](https://apps.shopify.com/retargetapp-facebook-retargeting), a Shopify app that lets store owners without tech skills launch Product Dynamic Advertising (retargeting campaigns) on Facebook.

With a 24/7 attention, we monitor each campaign’s performance and make sure to optimize its settings to let you get more clicks with less expenses.
[Retargetapp](https://apps.shopify.com/retargetapp-facebook-retargeting) is trusted by hundreds of happy customers. Here’s what they say about the results they got from using our app:  [How to spend $50 on Facebook Dynamic Ads and earn $3.8k?](https://retargetapp.quora.com/How-to-spend-50-on-Facebook-Dynamic-Ads-and-earn-3-8k-1)

https://themes.shopify.com/themes/react/styles/oak

And when clicking on the product page the price for product is two decimal spaces and I want it to be only one. 

i.e $9 and not $9.00

How can I do this?

Heres the code in the backend

    &lt;span id=""productPrice"" itemprop=""price""&gt;

ecommerce,Feedback for a newer notebook brand's website,"Hey everyone,

I've lurked on this subreddit for a while, and have always found the posts and comments pretty insightful. I'd love to get some of your eyes on my site and get some feedback on what you all think.

Currently, we're only seeing around 80-100 visitors a day, and would really appreciate some advice on how we can get those numbers up. I've started looking in to getting more engaging social media going, and I'm working on ideas for appropriate blog posts, but there's likely a whole bunch of things I haven't thought of that could help get website traffic up.

Our conversion rate is anywhere from 3-5%, so that's not too bad, but then again, this project was started on Kickstarter, so most of the traffic we get is highly engaged and meet the core demographic of who our buyers would be.

ecommerce,Would this be a service / plugin that you would find valuable and use as an ecommerce retailer?,"We are developing a service that we will most likely go OSS route with, I wanted to get feed back from shop owners that are not my clients to see how useful they would find it.

What we are creating is an engine for stats and email marketing. It sounds pretty complicated, but for the e-commerce site owner it is not really. What it does is provides email marketing to your customers that have created an account at some point on your site. 

From the merchant perspective this is how things will function. You create a few email templates using variables for your products. You assign those templates to products, you don't have to use the same template with a product, you can have a different template for each product. Then you will also set a time that you want emails sent, say 9am. Then you set the conditions for sending the emails. The conditions are basically product level overrides for which template to send to a customer. I am being horrible at explaining how the backend of the system works, it is one of those things for me that is easier to explain the result than the process.


How it looks to the customer. 

A customer visited your site yesterday who has an account. They looked at a few products but did not purchase anything. The next day they get an email that says ""Hey John, we still have those ultra cool sunglasses you looked at in stock"" Maybe it has a coupon, maybe it doesn't. That is up to the retailer. But at the same time it can be configured in a way of completed orders as well. Like every customer that orders the ultra cool sunglasses gets an email the next day suggesting that they might want the awesomely strong sun glass case for their new glasses. Or how this shirt would look great with their glasses.


Really it comes down to what ever you want. You can pick an event, when that event happens, be it a page view or a purchase, you can shoot off an email at a set interval. 


So would a system like this be interesting or usable for you guys and girls?",7.0,3,2015-07-17,ECOM,0.026081450283527374,0.9323217868804932,0.04159683734178543

Google has been most experimental with its search engine and algorithm. So much so that it now plans to introduce the option of shopping from Google search results by searchers.
 
The market share of Google is the highest among all the search engines. Over 70% of the world’s internet using population prefer Google to fufill all their search queries. And this has been the reason advertisers are struggling to make their ads visible on the search engine. A high number of users now are heavily using ecommerce sites to meet their shopping solutions. And Google plans to monetize on this increasing trend of online shopping. Thus to make online shopping effortless, Google plans to introduce direct shopping from Google search results.

Shopping From Google Search Results Available Now
The working of the new feature will be quite easy and online shoppers will be able to use it effortlessly. Once a searcher searches for a particular phrase or keyword, results for shopping are displayed in Google style cards in the result page. Searchers can then make direct payment through Google wallet or any other Android based payment portals. A shopper can complete the entire process of shopping without leaving the search engine result page.

ecommerce,A couple of questions,"hey e/commerce

I need help expanding our store (mostly conversions not the actual site) and wanted to ask for advice. We have a validated product with lots of positive feedback in a very large market - there is lots of room to grow.

I will try and avoid typical questions. I only had a few any input would be great.

1) Our product is very niche as a result SEO and PPC seem to have marginal value as a main traffic generator. However our product is very visual and design orientated so our plan is to mainly focus on blog promotion and Instagram.  Do you think this is a good idea? Can I build a large store of the back of those traffic sources initially?

2) Our store is currently doing $4000 pm and our current goal is to take that to $13000 as soon as we can. Is it realistic to assume getting there is just a generic scaling process?

3) Does anyone here have any first or second hand experience abut scaling niche/unconventional product stores? And have the time for some PM questions?

ecommerce,The contest day 2: A real time mini case study of our first contest (x-post r/entrepreneur),"We decided to launch our first contest for our eCommerce store. We sell dehydrated dog treats, and a few other holistic dog items. 

**Software and tools**
For the contest we're using Gleam, as a number of others have used it. We paid for the premium account to collect emails which we push to Mail Chimp.

**Goals**

* Drive sales 
* Build our email list
* Increase social following

**Tactics**
We have a number of ways to enter, but our biggest objective is making sales and building our email list. For this we placed high value on making a purchase (loyalty bonus for our customers of 25 entries), subscribing to our email list (10 entries) and referring a friend (5 entries). All other social entries are worth 1 each.

**Day 1 Results**
We launched with the birthday of one of our dogs, as such we naturally had a huge engagement rate on Facebook so we boosted the post a tiny amount. 

We also shared with a few Facebook groups, and a couple of relevant subreddits.

**Day 1 Results**

* 1 sale
* 20+ new Facebook likes
* 20+ new Instagram likes
* 30+ email sign ups. 

The promotion is really paying off!

**Day 2 results**
5 entries total. We've been working a trade show today so we haven't had as much time to promote it. 

**Key Leanings**
If you're running a contest promote it! On the first day we did an email, boosted FB post, linked in a few different places and had great results. The second day we've done nothing and the results have shown this. Make sure you have a promotion strategy for your entire time frame.

**What I'd do differently in my next contest**

* Shorter time frame. This one is running for a month, the length of the gleam subscription. Next time I'd do a 2 week contest and if it's well I'd have an encore contest. There isn't enough urgency in a month long contest and I'm worried people will get jaded.
* Have a stronger long tail promotion strategy to make sure it gets posted by at least one influencer every day.

**Next Update will be on Friday if there is enough interest**

**P.S.** If you wan to enter the contest to win some free treats, you can do so [here](http://treatshappen.com/pages/bentleybirthdaycontest).",8.0,0,2015-07-19,ECOM,0.02713806927204132,0.9220471382141113,0.05081479251384735

ecommerce,Taking Advantage of the 3-Stage Shopping Cart Abandonment Timeline,"In today’s eCommerce industry, shopping cart and checkout abandonment are all too common behaviors among online shoppers – with which online retailers continue to reconcile. Fortunately, there are various tactics and strategies to effectively reduce abandonments to a minimum and induce greater returns.

By learning about the behavioral characteristics of each group of “abandoners”, merchants can tailor segmented experiences and execute personalized campaigns launched on the three stages of the abandonment “timeline”, i.e. pre-abandonment, display of abandonment intent and post-abandonment. For example: 

* Simplifying the checkout process and providing upfront prices, clear payment methods and transparency in shipping costs, can dramatically reduce pre-abandonment dropouts.
* Upon display of abandonment intent, retailers may serve personalized offers and targeted promotions.
* Merchants can also leverage retargeting technologies, as well as personalized emails, to encourage abandoners to return to their sites.

shopify,Shopify Question: Subscription Fees and Pricing,"Hi everyone, new to this sub-reddit so go easy.

I'm in the process of launching my online ecommerce store via Shopify selling entirely digital content. It all seems rather simple. However, my business plan involves subscription fees. Is there a method of charging those customers that wish to subscribe on an annual/bi-annual basis?

Also, an important part of my store involves displaying prices for those that subscribe to my store and those that are not subscribed. Is there a method of displaying two prices?

I'm completely new to Shopify so I'm still trying to figure this all out, thanks for your time!

* add $6 customs paperwork fee for Canada and International orders

ecommerce,How To Know The Effect Of A/B Testing On Ecommerce Sites,"Most marketers focus on creating a perfect homepage and keep performing A/B testing to improve its attractiveness. However, many marketers often forget that once visitors navigate to the next pages leaving the home page behind, it is necessary to keep them hooked to those pages as well. Thus websites A/B testing on ecommerce sites should be carried out to improve the site’s presence.
 
Apart from the homepage, landing pages and product pages, regular A/B testing on ecommerce sites should be done to keep it attractive. Still most marketers rather than keeping a check on all corners of the website, just tend to highlight the homepage. This can sometimes prove to be detrimental for your website as it may lead to reduced traffic even with a great homepage.
Also Read: How To Utilize Competitive PPC Campaign For Marketing Your Website
Thus tracking each and every aspect of the website is important if you wish your site to make it to the top list of the search engine results page. Here are few techniques to know the impact of A/B testing on ecommerce sites.
Identifying through funnel reports
A visitor may go around a site looking over a number of elements. The surfing time is rather high on ecommerce sites where audience tend to spend a lot of time. However, every site has a few steps that the audience need to follow if they wish to make a purchase. This may be the simple step of visiting the site, viewing the product, adding to the cart and making the final purchase. These steps however, are viewed by the marketers in a funnel form.
Thus if you as a marketer follow the funnel metrics properly, you will be able to understand at which point exactly the visitors tend to leave. Once you have a clear idea which point of the funnel is the weak link, you can then start A/B testing on ecommerce sites to reduce the drop rates.
Analysing micro funnels
While the steps in the funnel are dynamic, marketers can also focus on the more minute details of the ecommerce site to draw out the metrics. Some ecommerce sites let you make direct purchase after you add a product to the cart. However, most sites tend to undergo some additional processes before completing a purchase process. Visitors often need to register with the sites or provide some additional details before moving to the next step.
Effect Of AB Testing On Ecommerce Sites
While almost all ecommerce websites have registration process, some even let visitors purchase directly without being registered.
You as market can keep a check on the unregistered visitor, and see how many of these customers register themselves with the site. Once you have a detailed data you can then check at which point in the registration process do visitors tend to leave. Modification and A/B testing on ecommerce sites to encourage more visitors to register to the website.
Interact with audience
Interacting with audience can provide you with immense information on visitors metrics and the points where visitors tend to leave. Certain ecommerce sites provide a pop-up chat box where visitors can get assisted in their purchase process. Marketers can ask for reasons why the visitor is not registering with the site, or he may ask why they have not made any purchase.
The feedback from these audience is valuable as this can point out where and what a site lacks. The marketer can then insert improved designs, simplify payment procedure or change a particular step in the funnel to increase the conversion rate.",0.0,1,2015-07-29,ECOM,0.1026708111166954,0.8710156679153442,0.02631358429789543

woocommerce,Multiple products within same category/tag,"Hello. I've built a large Wordpress site that integrates woocommerce and a variety of plugins for our needs, and I've hit an absolute brick wall regarding specific individual product requirements to build out the store. 

Normal use case: A t shirt retailer will have one product with 50 in stock, so they can keep the product listing forever and have it maximized with SEO etc.

My scenario: We sell one off used components that each are photographed and have individual descriptions/SN's/condition notes. At any given time I may have ten of the same product in stock, but because they are all truly separate I figured to give them their own product pages with custom URLs even containing the S/N. However, it seems crazy to me to create one off product pages, optimize the SEO, update site maps, etc and when it sells delete it because it's one of one. Does anyone have a work around? Feel like the coming and going of pages would be killer for SEO? All I could come up with was creating an indivual product page, and in the description creating short url's to a photo gallery of available units...however I then don't have a way for them to select which one they want...plus the pricing may not be the same.

As a seller, you work extremely hard to attract new site visitors (through guest posts, PR, ads, email marketing, SMM - you name it), but the truth is that only &lt; 3% of acquired users will buy from your website.

Facebook Dynamic Product Ads lets you remind the remaining one-time visitors of your brand and bring them back to your store whenever they're more likely to make a purchase.

That's just 1 reason why you should start running them right now.

ecommerce,Customer is claiming their UPS signature was forged - am I covered regardless?,"They paid with a credit card, no eBay or PayPal situation here. It's a Canadian order (I'm in the U.S.) for an abnormally high amount considering our product, which is *totally possible* yet could be suspicious only because this person happens to be saying they didn't receive it.

I showed them signature proof of receipt from UPS; the signature is a small scribble but the type entered by UPS clearly is that person's name.

If they file a chargeback with their bank, am I totally covered? They're actually asking me what to do - if I am covered, my first thought was I could call their bank and tell them the situation *before* having to go through the claims process as a surprise... or telling them to go for it since I have no fear since we have proof.

Am I safe here? What should I do at this exact point, especially because they are asking me what they're supposed to do. I don't want to *tell them* to file a claim because I don't know how I stand.

I am considering starting up an ecommerce store selling stationery. Yes, there is a big market for it with other competitors; but I have found the majority of competitors offer more bulk items, rather than a personal amount.

This store would be based in the UK, and although advise from Americans is greatly appreciated, things might operate differently.
My idea is, buy in bulk, wholesale- potentially from China, and turn it over in my online store, breaking bulk, into more of a sellable amount. My thinking is, focus on the back to school, getting kids ready stationery wise for school, offering offers and incentives to purchase of us; and hopefully grow from there.

Any thoughts on this, and advice greatly appreciated. I have done extensive research in ecommerce especially, and just need to find the right product to sell :)

(Also, that website would have prices for regular customers and wholesale prices for spas.) Since she only has one inventory, is it possible to set this up so that she only has to manage one back end?

Her current website runs WordPress, so I was thinking it might be a good idea to set up a WordPress multisite installation with two WooCommerce plugins. Would that work?",3.0,3,2015-07-31,ECOM,0.023956643417477608,0.9408555626869202,0.035187844187021255
shopify,"Best affiliate network app, marketing automation apps for Shopify?","I'm a WordPress/WooCommerce guy, and unfortunately I don't have a lot of experience with Shopify. I'm helping out a friend with her Shopify store, and she has a big opportunity in place soon but needs to generate some sales before then. I was thinking about putting together an affiliate network and put some basic marketing automation tools in place like cart abandonment, retargeting, etc.

Can anyone recommend any apps or services that work well with Shopify? Thanks!",4.0,2,2015-07-31,ECOM,0.01852002926170826,0.9073753356933594,0.07410462200641632

I'm trying to add products with lots of variations, but the product page in my Wordpress admin panel gets slower as more variations are added, until finally it just hangs.

My webhost suggested upgrading to a VPS package, but the monthly renewal for that is way above what I want to fork out for what is essentially an experiment.  Does anyone know another way around this problem?",2.0,1,2015-07-31,ECOM,0.045992568135261536,0.91884446144104,0.035162944346666336
