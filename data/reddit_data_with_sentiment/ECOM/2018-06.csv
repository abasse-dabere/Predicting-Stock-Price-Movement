woocommerce,How does the built in PayPal Express checkout take payments without linking an account? It offers this as a feature but I can't find any real documentation on it.,"Okay so I've setup WooCommerce and figure PayPal is a good starting point for accepting payments before I can get a contract for a ""real"" merchant account with an acquiring bank. Especially as PP seems more cost efficient to start off with, as a small business where you have no idea if it will work or not and could only be selling a few units a month and go bust in another six.

Now during the WooCommerce setup it offered me an option to accept PayPal payments to my email address without needing an account. I googled around and found no real info about exactly how they do this.

On the PayPal Express page in the settings it says:

&gt;Payments will be authenticated by WooCommerce Services and directed to the following email address.

Which suggests I simply need to have a normal PayPal account (not even a merchant one) and WooCommerce will redirect the payments to me.

When I hover over the little ""i"" it tells me:

&gt;You'll need to link your own account to perform anything other than ""sale"" transactions

So what does this mean then? If I use this default setup I can't get the money out of PayPal?

It's looking like it'd be a better option to just enable the regular PayPal plugin, make a proper merchant account, and set it up normally without using WooCommerce as a middleman.

But still I have to ask... how is this feature meant to work? How would WooCommerce process and redirect PayPal payments to me?

Maybe my Google-fu has let me down but I seriously cannot find any real answers on this anywhere.

shopify,Starting a Men's Grooming Brand and Growing Your Online Presence,"Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com here.

Today I interviewed Jack Scrimshire, who started [The Gentlemen's Lounge](https://thegentlemenslounge.co/), an e-commerce store that sells men's grooming products.

**I love this interview because Jack really goes into details about all of the little things about starting a business.**

He only started a few months ago, so hopefully this interview helps out some others out there that are just getting started.

---

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hi there! My name is Jack Scrimshire, and I’m creating a men’s grooming brand that promotes men’s health, grooming, and the lifestyle of the modern gentleman. 

Our products are all centered around beard care, and we sell to men who take pride in caring for the way they look and use natural products to do so.
 
Right now our monthly earnings are at about $1,000 with huge month-over-month growth. By the end of 2018, we expect to be averaging $10,000/month.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

The idea was a long time in the making. Around my second year into my college business degree, I got really into the idea of becoming a true gentleman and learning all of the skills and traits that makes someone a ""man"". 

About a year later, I realized there was no one way to be a man, and started looking for communities to learn a grow with and be a part of, to surround myself with likeminded people.
 
As my passion for entrepreneurship (and my fear of working for others my whole life) grew, I began looking into options of what kind of businesses to start. Ecommerce is obviously huge right now, and I figured I’d combine that with my passion for manliness and style. 

I had a long beard and had been buying beard products for a few years, but always had a few issues with them: they weren’t always effective at controlling the irritations that come with beard maintenance, it was hard to find organic products, and when they were they tended to get really pricey.

&gt; I’m still working full time as an operations analyst, living a modest lifestyle, prioritizing my earnings and funneling absolutely everything to aggressively paying off student and car loans, and I’ve reinvested every penny of the business income back into the business.

So, I started researching suppliers, ingredients, and recipes, and realized there was absolutely no reason that a bottle of healthy, natural, organic beard oil should cost as much as companies were asking. So, I ordered my first batch of ingredients and got to work!
 
I started out handing them out to friends and coworkers and they all loved them. I went ahead and created an Instagram, which quickly grew to around 8,000 followers and I started running giveaways there to further validate the products with people I didn’t know. When they told me they were the best beard care products they’d ever tried, I knew I was onto something.
 
At the time, I was making very little money having just graduated college. I’m still working full time as an operations analyst, living a modest lifestyle, prioritizing my earnings and funneling absolutely everything to aggressively paying off student and car loans, and I’ve reinvested every penny of the business income back into the business. I don’t plan to take a salary until loans are paid and the business is sustaining itself.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

I’m a pretty do-it-yourself kind of guy (and frankly don’t like spending money when I don’t have to), so when I realized how essential quality beard care products are, I started making them for myself. 

As I tried different recipes and batches, I was able to use them on myself to see how they worked. What’s great about beard products, is if something doesn’t work it’s, objectively obvious. If my beard was flaking after two weeks using particular oils, I knew that recipe wasn’t great.

&gt; All in all from packaging to ingredients my startup costs were around $2,000.

I spent about 4 months developing the best recipes I could come up with using cheap ingredients off Amazon, then when I had something worth using (and people were begging me for more), I found the absolute highest quality ingredients I could find. 

When I made the first batch of real product, the results were unbelievable. When it comes to beard care products, it typically takes about a week to see if they help in preventing itching, flaking, skin irritations, and brittle hairs. But my products had results almost instantly. It made my beard crazy soft in seconds and the irritations that developed from lack of use were all gone within a few hours to a day. I gave some samples out to friends and a few of my Instagram followers and they all shared similar stories.
 
All in all from packaging to ingredients my startup costs were around $2,000.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

In November 2016, I officially got my license and became a legal entity. 

It was at this point that I created social media accounts and started building my online presence. I tried growing organically using hashtags, relevant content, and engaging with my users and saw decent numbers but not much traction. 

I then switched to an app that would follow/unfollow people on Instagram in the background, which got me to around 5,000 followers, but got me really low quality followers. I will say however it gave me the initial credibility I needed to not look like that guy who started a beard care business using some ingredients he found in the kitchen. 

People like to see that you have a few thousand followers, so in that sense I think it helped a lot. My engagement is low as a result so it’s something I’m working through and have been seeing some decent results from testing new strategies and being more personable.
 
I financed the business out of my own personal savings, and have used my low limit business credit card to float transactions right up until I’m about to get charged interest to let money flow in before I spend the actual cash. I never let the interest hit and I always make sure I keep the balance within my set budgets, but this really helps keep cash on hand for what-if cases.
 
My costs for the full pre-launch phase were around $4,000. This includes the $2,000 from product design and testing, to creating the first batch. Getting a logo made, domain, website hosting, supplies and tools to make products, packaging, shipping for test batches to customers, and a few small marketing campaigns.
 
I launched officially on October 1, 2017, and began by hyping it up on social media. 

I did a count down where every day I would feature a follower by posting a picture of their beard with an overlay saying how many days left until the launch. In the background I was scrambling to get labels printed properly (wasted a bunch of money on low resolution labels since I didn’t know how to make them properly), and literally finished my launch batch of products on September 30, with only two days to spare for launch. I took the product photos and was editing them right up until the moment my site went live. Within the first 15 minutes, I had around 400 visitors to my site coming from Instagram, and a few sales. The sales kept trickling in over the next few days and this gave me hope that this was worth pursuing.
 
The biggest lesson I learned was that you can do it all yourself, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should. After launch I spent the next few months tweaking the site, fixing product photos (which were horrible, by the way), writing automated email flows, and doing all those one-and done tasks that take a lot of time but have to be done. 

This doesn’t sound like much, but when you only get a couple hours a night to work on it after work and the family is in bed, it takes a long time to get done. Once they’re done, they really don’t need to be focused on aside from updates over time to maintain them. The thing is, if I’d have hired someone to do these things, it would maybe have cost me around $1,000 but I would have been months ahead of schedule and had a much more professional appearance from the start. So figure out what you’re good at, do those things, and get help with the rest.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

Traffic comes mostly from social media still, and a decent amount from SEO, although now that my site is where I want it to be I am switching gears over to paid marketing.

The site has been profitable every month since launch, but now I want to get new eyes on us and really start to see how this performs with people who don’t know us. I know I will have to be very tactful with my marketing because our market is very saturated. It’s going to take strategic effort to show that we’re the real deal and have something that’s better than what they’ve used before.

&gt; I’d say email flows are huge. It lets you personally reach out to someone to welcome them without having to lift a finger. You just set it and forget it. I’m big into automation and this is easily the most powerful personal interaction you can automate. 

Right now we use automated email flows and they work great. I have a pop-up on my site where you can opt in and every month we give one person on our list a year’s supply of beard oil. It’s got a good conversion rate and gets surprisingly high quality leads. When they opt in they get a 7 day flow of introductory emails that indoctrinate our brand, introduce the company, talk about our values, our products and how great they are, and makes them feel as though they are now a part of our community/family. We really want high LTV so community is huge for us. We have also set up automated flows for first-time purchasers, repeat purchasers, people who haven’t bought anything in a while, and we send weekly campaigns that talk about what’s going on, links to new blog posts, give sneak peeks of new products and an occasional sale.
 
I’d say email flows are huge. It lets you personally reach out to someone to welcome them without having to lift a finger. You just set it and forget it. I’m big into automation and this is easily the most powerful personal interaction you can automate. 

Social media is also huge, and Instagram is a large chunk of our revenue right now. If you’re not using Instagram to showcase your company’s values and the lifestyle around your products, you need to. Don’t just post photos of your products, people want you to entertain, educate, and enlighten them. Do this, and they’ll feel a connection to you and to your products. They’ll want to support you because they know you and they believe what you believe.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

As mentioned above, the next step is serious growth and customer acquisition. I believe that once a customer purchases from us they will continue to come back for more, and we have our email automation set up to keep them actively engaged with us for a long time to come. So the next step is Facebook ads and email collection. Overall, we are right about at break even, so I’m looking to test the best ways to spend what we need to in order to get quality customers to join us, while still trying to scale enough that we push ourselves into the green.
 
Operations-wise, it’s still pretty hectic as I’m a one-man show. This means I do all content creation, social media management, customer outreach, order fulfilling, etc. so automation is huge. I use software that allows me to schedule posts to Instagram, facebook and twitter, and I’ll spend a few hours each month scheduling out the next month of content. Being able to automate processes like this make it way easier to keep everything under control and really chunk your time in manageable buckets to still be able to get things done and keep your focus on one thing at a time.
 
Eventually I’d like to hire customer experience specialists who fulfill orders, manage social media, and respond to customer support inquiries. That will free up a lot of time to work on the bigger picture items and the revenue-driving aspects of the business. I’d also like to start wholesaling to high end barbershops and salons to get other people selling products for us.
 
In the near future we’ll be releasing handmade wooden beard combs and boar’s hair brushes that are being designed and built by a master woodworker, and from there we’ll move onto beard soaps and conditioners.
 
Short term the goals are just to get our names out there and start building a buzz. Long term, we’d like to be the premier provider of hand-crafted men’s grooming supplies in the US, ranging from beard care to skin care to hair care and beyond.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

I think the biggest thing is to avoid wasting money on things you don’t need. 

I’m very financially sound but was still able to talk myself into some purchases that have not yet served the purpose I thought they would. I had to learn a lot about a wide variety of topics, so if you plan to start a business in the future, start learning now. The more you know the better off you’ll be and when you eventually do hire help you be able to talk to them more effectively since you have a basic understanding of what they’re doing. Be honest about your capabilities, and if you’re not good at something, get help. A good freelancer will be able to guide you in the right direction and take your vision and put it into play in a way you never thought possible. Make sure you vet the people you hire and do your due diligence and you’ll be really happy with the results.
 
And of course, there might just be lucky breaks but you have to put yourself out there for them. A few months ago I emailed a large subscription box service about having them use my products in a box, and now we’re discussing a recurring wholesale agreement with them. Things like this do happen if you put yourself out there. So seize opportunities and never view yourself as ""too small"" to do the things the big guys do.
 
I’ve learned a lot of lessons along the way and will continue to learn every day. The education I’ve gotten out of this experience have made it worth every penny and every second spent building it. If you’re worried about the expense of your idea, just try to view it as an expensive course on life and business and go for it. If it goes well, then great! If not, then at least you learned something. Be open to learning, listen to your customers, and take what your peers have to say with a grain of salt. A lot of people will doubt you and some will believe in you. Just expect that there will be people you never expected that will doubt you, and it’s going to suck, but you just have to keep moving forward.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

I use Shopify to host my website. Their customer support is unparalleled and the platform is super easy to use. I recommend you purchase a paid theme for it. 

I use Motion, but Turbo by Themeforest is really good too. The out of the box themes are going to make you look just like everybody else and that’s never a good thing.
 
As for Shopify apps:

- judge.me reviews, because for $15/month my customers can receive automated emails, post reviews/photos, and ask and answer questions. They have really good support and they’re always enhancing the product.
- Easy Contact Form by Zotabox, as it is pretty good looking and easy to use and definitely an improvement over the standard one from Shopify.
- Klaviyo to create better looking order notifications for customers so that they are branded according to my other email flows.
- Semantic3 Analytics. Still not sure how accurate their reporting is, but it shows a pretty good picture of what’s going on in your store.
- Ordermetrics.io. I don’t use the paid version yet but will as soon as I’m able to. It shows a breakdown of your earnings and expenses on each order to give you profit/loss reporting. The pro version even pulls in your marketing expenses from facebook and google.
-  Lucky Orange. This allows me to see what users are doing on my store so I can find holes in my funnel or areas where they may have questions.
 

I use Klaviyo for email marketing, because the way you can set your flows is so advanced. I can send an email to every guy named John who bought a beard balm on a Tuesday, and have it send every time that happens. Obviously this isn’t how you’d use it, but it’s truly very powerful and worth the expense.

I use Hootsuite to schedule and automate social media. It’s around $250 a year, but the amount of time it saves is well worth the expense. They have a free version which I think allows you 35 scheduled posts at a time, but I have around 150-300 schedule at any time.
 
I use G Suite for their business suite. Google drive allows me to work from anywhere and keep everything organized. Calendar lets me book video calls with freelancers and stay on schedule with my limited work hours. This also gives me my domain’s email address as well. This product has helped a lot with appearing professional and staying organized.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

To be honest, I can’t really say that any book in particular inspired my business. I love to read business books and try to apply any learnings I like, but can’t say anything has really been influential in particular. 

The 4-Hour Workweek had me focusing on how to automate processes and keep my time on my hands. I have used YouTube a lot to learn the things I had questions about as far as marketing, coding, and sales.
 
I really think in the beginning you should just get out there and do it. Start learning hands-on what works and what doesn’t for your business, then as you continue to read and learn you can try new things, but you’ll also be able to weed out the things that won’t work based on the experience you already have.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

First thing’s first, just get something started. Even if it’s only a tiny portion of what you want to eventually have, at least you’re doing something. Don’t be afraid to lose money on something you believe in, you can always get it back. Try things and learn what works, and view it all as one big lesson in life, and really figure out why you’re doing this. Entrepreneurship is hard. Like, really hard. I’ve spent the last year and a half working towards some mystical place I call success, not really even knowing what that is or how long it will take to get there.
 
All I know is that I really love what I’m doing and it makes me happy as hell. I also know that I may wake up some days and wonder why I’m even bothering, and doubting that this kind of thing can take off. I know that there’s one thing that is driving all that I do, and that is to be able to provide for my future family. It is me and my fiancée right now, and it kills to me tell her we can’t do something because I can’t get off work, or my bank account isn’t set up right (a.k.a. they forgot to put the money in it). So until the day I have the financial and time freedom that I’m searching for, I’ll keep doing whatever it takes. Find out your ""why"" and go for it.

### Where can we go to learn more?

You can find me in quite a few places.

ecommerce,Starting a Men's Grooming Brand and Growing Your Online Presence,"Hey - Pat here with another interview.

Today, I interviewed Jack Scrimshire, who started The Gentlemen's Lounge, an e-commerce store that sells men's grooming products.

**I love this interview because Jack really goes into details about all of the little things about starting a business.**

He only started a few months ago, so hopefully this interview helps out some others out there that are just getting started.

---

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hi there! My name is Jack Scrimshire, and I’m creating a men’s grooming brand that promotes men’s health, grooming, and the lifestyle of the modern gentleman. 

Our products are all centered around beard care, and we sell to men who take pride in caring for the way they look and use natural products to do so.
 
Right now our monthly earnings are at about $1,000 with huge month-over-month growth. By the end of 2018, we expect to be averaging $10,000/month.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

The idea was a long time in the making. Around my second year into my college business degree, I got really into the idea of becoming a true gentleman and learning all of the skills and traits that makes someone a ""man"". 

About a year later, I realized there was no one way to be a man, and started looking for communities to learn a grow with and be a part of, to surround myself with likeminded people.
 
As my passion for entrepreneurship (and my fear of working for others my whole life) grew, I began looking into options of what kind of businesses to start. Ecommerce is obviously huge right now, and I figured I’d combine that with my passion for manliness and style. 

I had a long beard and had been buying beard products for a few years, but always had a few issues with them: they weren’t always effective at controlling the irritations that come with beard maintenance, it was hard to find organic products, and when they were they tended to get really pricey.

&gt; I’m still working full time as an operations analyst, living a modest lifestyle, prioritizing my earnings and funneling absolutely everything to aggressively paying off student and car loans, and I’ve reinvested every penny of the business income back into the business.

So, I started researching suppliers, ingredients, and recipes, and realized there was absolutely no reason that a bottle of healthy, natural, organic beard oil should cost as much as companies were asking. So, I ordered my first batch of ingredients and got to work!
 
I started out handing them out to friends and coworkers and they all loved them. I went ahead and created an Instagram, which quickly grew to around 8,000 followers and I started running giveaways there to further validate the products with people I didn’t know. When they told me they were the best beard care products they’d ever tried, I knew I was onto something.
 
At the time, I was making very little money having just graduated college. I’m still working full time as an operations analyst, living a modest lifestyle, prioritizing my earnings and funneling absolutely everything to aggressively paying off student and car loans, and I’ve reinvested every penny of the business income back into the business. I don’t plan to take a salary until loans are paid and the business is sustaining itself.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

I’m a pretty do-it-yourself kind of guy (and frankly don’t like spending money when I don’t have to), so when I realized how essential quality beard care products are, I started making them for myself. 

As I tried different recipes and batches, I was able to use them on myself to see how they worked. What’s great about beard products, is if something doesn’t work it’s, objectively obvious. If my beard was flaking after two weeks using particular oils, I knew that recipe wasn’t great.

&gt; All in all from packaging to ingredients my startup costs were around $2,000.

I spent about 4 months developing the best recipes I could come up with using cheap ingredients off Amazon, then when I had something worth using (and people were begging me for more), I found the absolute highest quality ingredients I could find. 

When I made the first batch of real product, the results were unbelievable. When it comes to beard care products, it typically takes about a week to see if they help in preventing itching, flaking, skin irritations, and brittle hairs. But my products had results almost instantly. It made my beard crazy soft in seconds and the irritations that developed from lack of use were all gone within a few hours to a day. I gave some samples out to friends and a few of my Instagram followers and they all shared similar stories.
 
All in all from packaging to ingredients my startup costs were around $2,000.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

In November 2016, I officially got my license and became a legal entity. 

It was at this point that I created social media accounts and started building my online presence. I tried growing organically using hashtags, relevant content, and engaging with my users and saw decent numbers but not much traction. 

I then switched to an app that would follow/unfollow people on Instagram in the background, which got me to around 5,000 followers, but got me really low quality followers. I will say however it gave me the initial credibility I needed to not look like that guy who started a beard care business using some ingredients he found in the kitchen. 

People like to see that you have a few thousand followers, so in that sense I think it helped a lot. My engagement is low as a result so it’s something I’m working through and have been seeing some decent results from testing new strategies and being more personable.
 
I financed the business out of my own personal savings, and have used my low limit business credit card to float transactions right up until I’m about to get charged interest to let money flow in before I spend the actual cash. I never let the interest hit and I always make sure I keep the balance within my set budgets, but this really helps keep cash on hand for what-if cases.
 
My costs for the full pre-launch phase were around $4,000. This includes the $2,000 from product design and testing, to creating the first batch. Getting a logo made, domain, website hosting, supplies and tools to make products, packaging, shipping for test batches to customers, and a few small marketing campaigns.
 
I launched officially on October 1, 2017, and began by hyping it up on social media. 

I did a count down where every day I would feature a follower by posting a picture of their beard with an overlay saying how many days left until the launch. In the background I was scrambling to get labels printed properly (wasted a bunch of money on low resolution labels since I didn’t know how to make them properly), and literally finished my launch batch of products on September 30, with only two days to spare for launch. I took the product photos and was editing them right up until the moment my site went live. Within the first 15 minutes, I had around 400 visitors to my site coming from Instagram, and a few sales. The sales kept trickling in over the next few days and this gave me hope that this was worth pursuing.
 
The biggest lesson I learned was that you can do it all yourself, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should. After launch I spent the next few months tweaking the site, fixing product photos (which were horrible, by the way), writing automated email flows, and doing all those one-and done tasks that take a lot of time but have to be done. 

This doesn’t sound like much, but when you only get a couple hours a night to work on it after work and the family is in bed, it takes a long time to get done. Once they’re done, they really don’t need to be focused on aside from updates over time to maintain them. The thing is, if I’d have hired someone to do these things, it would maybe have cost me around $1,000 but I would have been months ahead of schedule and had a much more professional appearance from the start. So figure out what you’re good at, do those things, and get help with the rest.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

Traffic comes mostly from social media still, and a decent amount from SEO, although now that my site is where I want it to be I am switching gears over to paid marketing.

The site has been profitable every month since launch, but now I want to get new eyes on us and really start to see how this performs with people who don’t know us. I know I will have to be very tactful with my marketing because our market is very saturated. It’s going to take strategic effort to show that we’re the real deal and have something that’s better than what they’ve used before.

&gt; I’d say email flows are huge. It lets you personally reach out to someone to welcome them without having to lift a finger. You just set it and forget it. I’m big into automation and this is easily the most powerful personal interaction you can automate. 

Right now we use automated email flows and they work great. I have a pop-up on my site where you can opt in and every month we give one person on our list a year’s supply of beard oil. It’s got a good conversion rate and gets surprisingly high quality leads. When they opt in they get a 7 day flow of introductory emails that indoctrinate our brand, introduce the company, talk about our values, our products and how great they are, and makes them feel as though they are now a part of our community/family. We really want high LTV so community is huge for us. We have also set up automated flows for first-time purchasers, repeat purchasers, people who haven’t bought anything in a while, and we send weekly campaigns that talk about what’s going on, links to new blog posts, give sneak peeks of new products and an occasional sale.
 
I’d say email flows are huge. It lets you personally reach out to someone to welcome them without having to lift a finger. You just set it and forget it. I’m big into automation and this is easily the most powerful personal interaction you can automate. 

Social media is also huge, and Instagram is a large chunk of our revenue right now. If you’re not using Instagram to showcase your company’s values and the lifestyle around your products, you need to. Don’t just post photos of your products, people want you to entertain, educate, and enlighten them. Do this, and they’ll feel a connection to you and to your products. They’ll want to support you because they know you and they believe what you believe.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

As mentioned above, the next step is serious growth and customer acquisition. I believe that once a customer purchases from us they will continue to come back for more, and we have our email automation set up to keep them actively engaged with us for a long time to come. So the next step is Facebook ads and email collection. Overall, we are right about at break even, so I’m looking to test the best ways to spend what we need to in order to get quality customers to join us, while still trying to scale enough that we push ourselves into the green.
 
Operations-wise, it’s still pretty hectic as I’m a one-man show. This means I do all content creation, social media management, customer outreach, order fulfilling, etc. so automation is huge. I use software that allows me to schedule posts to Instagram, facebook and twitter, and I’ll spend a few hours each month scheduling out the next month of content. Being able to automate processes like this make it way easier to keep everything under control and really chunk your time in manageable buckets to still be able to get things done and keep your focus on one thing at a time.
 
Eventually I’d like to hire customer experience specialists who fulfill orders, manage social media, and respond to customer support inquiries. That will free up a lot of time to work on the bigger picture items and the revenue-driving aspects of the business. I’d also like to start wholesaling to high end barbershops and salons to get other people selling products for us.
 
In the near future we’ll be releasing handmade wooden beard combs and boar’s hair brushes that are being designed and built by a master woodworker, and from there we’ll move onto beard soaps and conditioners.
 
Short term the goals are just to get our names out there and start building a buzz. Long term, we’d like to be the premier provider of hand-crafted men’s grooming supplies in the US, ranging from beard care to skin care to hair care and beyond.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

I think the biggest thing is to avoid wasting money on things you don’t need. 

I’m very financially sound but was still able to talk myself into some purchases that have not yet served the purpose I thought they would. I had to learn a lot about a wide variety of topics, so if you plan to start a business in the future, start learning now. The more you know the better off you’ll be and when you eventually do hire help you be able to talk to them more effectively since you have a basic understanding of what they’re doing. Be honest about your capabilities, and if you’re not good at something, get help. A good freelancer will be able to guide you in the right direction and take your vision and put it into play in a way you never thought possible. Make sure you vet the people you hire and do your due diligence and you’ll be really happy with the results.
 
And of course, there might just be lucky breaks but you have to put yourself out there for them. A few months ago I emailed a large subscription box service about having them use my products in a box, and now we’re discussing a recurring wholesale agreement with them. Things like this do happen if you put yourself out there. So seize opportunities and never view yourself as ""too small"" to do the things the big guys do.
 
I’ve learned a lot of lessons along the way and will continue to learn every day. The education I’ve gotten out of this experience have made it worth every penny and every second spent building it. If you’re worried about the expense of your idea, just try to view it as an expensive course on life and business and go for it. If it goes well, then great! If not, then at least you learned something. Be open to learning, listen to your customers, and take what your peers have to say with a grain of salt. A lot of people will doubt you and some will believe in you. Just expect that there will be people you never expected that will doubt you, and it’s going to suck, but you just have to keep moving forward.

shopify,Getting Sales with Reddit Ads! A new method that no one's talking about,"I want to talk about exactly how you can use reddit ads for drive traffic and sales to your store, and optimize your ads to get the biggest bang for your buck.

This was originally a video:

[https://youtu.be/v768Q6EE22M](https://youtu.be/v768Q6EE22M)

That I transcribed so everyone could read it as well. I would love some support on the Youtube video, but anyways, here is text version of it if you prefer, so I can give everyone some value.

Without further ado, let’s get straight into it.

1. Why does reddit work and why should you use it?
   1. No one is using it, and people aren’t use to seeing dropshipping products. With places like Facebook and Instagram that are so oversaturated people are use to the free \+ shipping things. And, odds are, they’ve seen similar products to yours before your ad shows up.
   2. With reddit, it's different because it’s pretty much a clean slate. I have never heard a dropshipping guru or youtuber talk about reddit ads. It’s seldom talked about and that’s why I think you should use it. 
   3. How do you use reddit ads?
      1. It’s very similar to Facebook ads in that you can select interests to target. And also what I like, is you can target specific subreddits. So, I would recommend you make a list of what subreddits your niche is in, and what people would like. 
2. Your website has to be mobile friendly. Ads work great on mobile, but don't’ let that be a turn off point. Your website needs to be completely optimized for all platforms and must have a great product page. I have talked about this in my other videos so feel free to search around my channel for how to create a high converting shopify store. 

The aim of this was to get people to experiment with different platforms. I feel that too many people are using Instagram influencers and facebook. They work, but some stores and products can do really well on places like Reddit, Youtube, or Snapchat.

shopify,Do you see it as 7-8mil profit business model?,"I'm calling out people who know what they are talking about - I just don't think those who just started out have knowledge necessary to answer this kind of question :P

going back to the topic, do you see it being scalable to those figures - 7-8mil profit/year? do you know any cases of people actually achieving it?

to think of it, those YT gurus who are talking about how much their store is making, most likely are talking about store's revenue and even if they mention profit, they most likely don't include taxes - which means that store making 1m/yr actually turns probably 100-200k profit - which is of course less impressive than $1m clickbait

on top of that there has to be reason why gurus waste time on YT videos rather than growing their business - that is selling knowledge about something makes more money than actually doing that thing

so honestly it seems unrealistic for dropshipping business to turn yearly profit in millions 

i started thinking about it because i've seen thread on BHW discussing DS profits, and one user claimed to be friends with someone making 3m/month (dont remember if net) from this very model

me personally, i look at DS as a good way to learn about ecom + marketing and as a way to actually raise capital necessary to do something else

dropship,How does your dropshipping business compete with branded products?,"Hi all,

New member here. I am looking into starting my own drop shipping business. Because I do not have a large amount of capital, I probably will go down the Shopify + Oberlo path. My question is, since Oberlo imports good from AliExpress, and most of them are generic brands, how do you compete with branded products?

Fitness is something I enjoy pursuing and I am looking to source and sell fitness wear, sportwears and related accessories. But I cannot work my head around how I can sell those, because when people go out and buy those sport wear, they prefer a Nike/Addidas/ASICS/Under Amour logo rather than a generic brand or a Chinese brand.

Has anyone had success in drop shipping things that can compete against branded products?

Thanks all in advance.",7,3,2018-06-04,ECOM,0.022391846403479576,0.924934446811676,0.052673690021038055

ecommerce,What is THE MOST Important Thing on Your Site's Home/Landing Page(s)?,"Some might say ""Logo"", or great photography, or even a Call To Action.  And, while all of those things are important... you'd be wrong.

The answer: VALUE PROPOSITION

What is a ""Value Proposition""? 

**val·ue prop·o·si·tion**
*noun*
(in marketing) an innovation, service, or feature intended to make a company or product attractive to customers.

Basically, it is a clear and concise statement used to summarize why a customer should purchase from you, and not your competitor.

**What makes a great Value Proposition?**

* It should very quickly communicate to your customer what it is about your product/company/service/etc. that makes you the one they need to purchase from.

* It should have a bold Headline that is a single (2, at most) sentence explaining the unique benefit of your product or service.  It can have a sub-header of a couple of sentences/bullet points expounding on the benefits of purchasing your product/service.  Keep the copy down to a minimum here.  You only have a few seconds to capture your potential customer's attention.  Make it count.

**How do you write a strong Value Proposition?**

* First, you have to differentiate the benefits of your product or service, from that of your competitors.  Let's say you're selling shoes.  Every shoe comes in different sizes for the best fit.  Every shoe protects the sole of your foot.  These shouldn't be used in a V.P.  What does your shoe do different, and why is that beneficial to me (as a customer)?

* Second, remember that this is *perceived* value.  So, if you and your competitor(s) sell the EXACT SAME THING... it's your job to make sure your potential customer *perceives* your product to be more valuable to them.  Figure out a benefit that your competitor(s) haven't (or at least aren't advertising).  All you have to do is make your customer BELIEVE that your product is superior, even if it is identical.  Make sure you don't lie here.  Repeat customers are EXTREMELY important to your business.

* Make a list of your product's/service's features.  Then, write how each of those features will benefit your customer.  How does it fix a problem that you KNOW your customer has?  Now have a friend do the same thing with your competitor's product/service.  Compare them.  Are there any differences?  If they are similar, you've got to dig deeper... find something to say that they aren't saying.

* If your site has reviews (it should), look through them.  See if there is a common thread in what your customers are saying about your product/service.  If there is, your VP just wrote itself, and is the most effective VP you can have, as it's inspired by how your existing customers *perceive* you.

* Make sure to only make claims that you can back up.  Avoid using terms like ""Best Widgets In The World"".  There is an immediate disbelief that is triggered in your customer's mind after reading things like that.  Common sense tells them you have no way of backing that claim up.

As a potential customer, a GREAT Value Proposition should be able to, in 7 seconds or less:

* Tell me what your product or service is...

* What it will do for me...

* **And why I should buy it from you, and not elsewhere.**

Value Propositions aren't just the most important thing on your home or landing page.  They are what makes your site pull your visitors further into that conversion funnel.  Every Call To Action should have a value proposition tell your potential customer why they should click that button.",16,39,2018-06-05,ECOM,0.041338130831718445,0.9307633638381958,0.027898557484149933

ecommerce,How do you get publicity/media coverage for your products?,"Hey, r/ecommerce! I just wrote a post on how to think like a journalist and get your products covered by the media with no money or connections. I know the struggle of trying to get traffic to your website and, having been a journalist in a previous life, I know how writers and bloggers think.

The majority of the post is below. I'll share the link to the full post with sample emails in the comments. If you have additional advice or suggestions, please share in the comments.
***

One of the best ways to get more shoppers to your store is with publicity. Media outlets already have the traffic, why not let them send it your way?

But you can’t just call up the Today Show and say, “Hey, I sell stuff. Plz tell the world for me. Thx, bye.”

That’s not going to work. Journalists and influencers hear pitches all day long. You have to make it interesting for them and relevant to their audiences. So where should you start?

**Make a List of Relevant Sites**

Big media outlets get thousands of press releases each day. It’s like showing up at an American Idol casting call. You’re not getting in unless you really stand out. So take your story somewhere smaller, where it’s easier to get in the door.

Do a little research on blogs that target your niche and see if they’ll let you submit your products for review or even do a guest post. But how do you find a whole list of blogs like that? Google, my friend! Search for things like:

* XYZ product reviews
* XYZ bloggers
* XYZ influencers

The results that appear on the first page will be high ranking, which means they likely have lots of followers. That means lots of potential customers.

Start a spreadsheet or Word doc with the name of the site, writer’s name, article name, contact info, etc. It’s also a good idea to Google the writer and see who else they’ve written for. That can give you more leads and help you “get to know” the writer so that you can tailor your pitch to them.

If that seems like a lot of work, hire someone on Fiverr to do it for you. Or you can pay roughly $20 and use a service like Press Farm. Or just get started with this list of product blogs:

* Shut Up and Take My Money
* Gear Patrol
* Thrillist
* Uncrate
* Cool Hunting

You’ll need to have a look around all these sites and make sure your product appeals to their target audience. Make sure you have images that won’t look out of place on their site. Don’t waste your time pitching to sites that aren’t a good fit.

**How to Pitch Your Products**

Now you have a list of all these sites and writers that you know will be a perfect fit for your products. But you can’t just shove your products in their face and say, “Give me attention!” You want to build a relationship with them so that you can continue to squeeze that media juice from them in the future. And, ya know, because they’re actual humans who you might enjoy chatting with since you share a common interest (your niche!).

A few guidelines:

* Make sure your subject line is attention-grabbing
* Don’t use all caps (STOP SHOUTING!)
* Show your personality, stand out
* Offer to send them a product sample
* Customize each email to its recipient
* Make it easy for them to contact you – display your email, phone, etc. prominently
* Follow up, follow up, follow up

**Subject Lines**

In journalism school (is that still a thing?), journalists learn that the headline is by far the most important part of the story. They often spend as much time crafting a good headline as they do writing a good article. A good headline ensures readers will check out the accompanying article. A bad headline means no one cares. Treat your subject line like a headline. You can even use a headline analyzer to make sure it’s engaging.

A few ideas:

* Product X Launching in July, Samples Available for Review
* Follow Up to Your Piece on X
* I’m a Paper Salesman Who Started a Swizzle Stick Company

**The Email**

Remember to think like a journalist. Three things you need to keep in mind:

1. The Five W’s: Who, what, when, where, why. Be sure to answer these in your email.
1. The Inverted Pyramid: Put the most important info at the top with less important/background info at the end.
1. Newsworthiness: The story you tell must contain something interesting. Things like:
* Conflict – does your product go against common thinking or solve a common problem?
* Extremes – the biggest, smallest, newest, worst, etc.
* Timeliness – does it relate to an upcoming holiday or something in the news?
* Surprising – is there something unexpected about your product or story?

**Following Up**

People get busy, they forget things, stuff falls through the cracks. Don’t be afraid to keep following up. Once a week is probably enough. Give it the old three strikes and you’re out rule. After the third follow up without a response, let it go and try someone else.

**Making It a Habit**

If you send out 5 emails and expect your product to blow up, you’re going to have a rough time. You need to be consistent. Make it a goal to reach out to a specific number of people per day or week. The more you reach out, the more responses you’ll get.

But don’t get trigger happy. Remember to focus on writers related to your niche.

**Conclusion**

Find the people who want to hear about your products and get your products in front of them. It’s far more effective than sending out a mass press release to everyone with an email address.",9,10,2018-06-05,ECOM,0.04327926225960255,0.9255833923816681,0.03113733511418104
dropship,Advise on Testing a New Product with IG Influencers,"Ive been dropshipping for just over a month now and have only had one sale off of a product that i have since stopped marketing. (for various reasons) I now have picked a new product/niche that im all ready to start marketing. However im stuck on how to go about finding an influencer that would be worth my money. With my previous exprerience, i searched for cheap influencers (not saying they didnt get decent engagement) however i used multiple influencers all around 20 bucks a post to test this product. After spending over 100 dollars on various wastes of money, im pondering whether i should with this new product sort of go all in with a single influencer or use various cheaper ones right off the bat. I feel as if my new product has the potential to do very well as i have seen it popping up here and there. 

Should i test this product the same way i did my last one? With lots of smaller influencers? Or should i spend more money to get a higher quality shoutout on a page that is bigger? With your experience how much does a ""higher quality, larger page"" shoutout cost? 100 bucks? more? Just looking for some direction so that i dont go about this in the wrong way.

ecommerce,Shopify Lite? Xcart Free? Other Secure Ecommerce solutions?,"I've been doing web design or some sort of web development at least part time for over 10 years. None of my clients have ever needed an online store so I have little experience with them but I am currently working with someone who is looking to sell Ebooks for their non\-profit. I dont imagine them having very many SKU's\(less than 100 Im guessing\) but I dont know for sure how dedicated they are to creating content.

My main concern here is security for their information as well as their customers.  I don't need a hosted solution or a template. I have a good VPS with Plesk installed, plenty of storage, and unlimited bandwidth. I also don't need to buy a template because I can do that myself. I'm trying to keep the costs low because if I'm not coding it or customizing it I usually just pass the direct cost to my client.

While looking into some of the more popular ecommerce solutions I came across both shopify, which I had heard of before, and Xcart. Shopify has a lite version for $9/mo and Xcart has a free version, but neither really list what features the lower versions have. I'm looking for something I can host that is cost efficient but secure, my client also would like PayPal as an option which seems like it would be pretty standard. The ability to sell in person seems like something that would be good as well. I hate asking questions like this because it seems like I dont want to do the leg work, but when I read through their websites and even reviews of them it only talks about the highest level packages and not something for the mostly DIY shop that isn't looking to pay more per month than they may make in sales at first.

If anyone has any experience with either Xcart Free, Shopify, or any other solution I would love some insight. I would hate to try to help this person and advise them in the wrong direction or set them up for failure because they cant make money due to high initial monthly fees for services I can provide free or cheap.",8,3,2018-06-05,ECOM,0.047235485166311264,0.920960545539856,0.0318039245903492

Now that the story she shared is over and that we don't want to bombard her groups with posts, our traffic has died down a lot.

-Anything apparent that needs to be fixed?

-I'm currently running my second ad which is targeting a pretty good audience (IMO) based off google trends and is in an audience size of roughly 80k. It's the second day running and has roughly 275 impressions but only 6 link clicks. Any advice on how to increase engagement with the said ad?

-I'm tempted to get into Google AdWords now that I saw there's a $100 credit when $25 spent. Any advice on this other than to do my homework like everything else?

So you've got custom page builders like PageFly, Shogun, Hypervisual and such, but you've also got the premium themes in there. Now, I assume that once a brand grows enough it's able to get its own website custom made, however, when starting you look whether investing 180 is worth it and will provide the same capability of customization as a page builder!

I've also heard, however, that page builders slow your website down by 4\-5 seconds (which seems like a lot). So what's your experience? What would you do if you were trying to achieve a really nice looking product page like Allbirds' or so?

ecommerce,Help: Choosing a payment portal for my type of business?,"Hi ecommerce reddit!

I don't frequent much so I apologize if I broke any rules are asked a very repetitive question.

I have been using PayPal for the last 8 months or so, with some frustrations but I decided to stick with them because they are well known. 

Recently, the issues I faced with PayPal have become a little bit ridiculous, and I'm thinking about switching payment platforms all-together. I wanted to ask for the best recommendation based on my business type.

I run an online game service, which like League of Legends or Free-to-Play phone games. My product is additional resources in the game to further a player's progress or allow them to get items otherwise not available to the public. It is a digital good.

As the nature of the internet, people have tried to file charge-backs against me and have even gone as far as faking an un-authorized payment. These players were ones that did not read our server information and were surprised that we have some feature changes, or they were banned for using game related hacks to further themselves in the game.

I am looking for a service which:
- Protects the business, especially the Digital Goods business where I can safely operate my business without the fear of someone deciding to chargeback
- Easy access to the account's balances and transferring them to a bank account
- Some decent accounting tools to help track day-to-day operations, month-to-month
- Fair rates (hopefully lower than what PayPal was charging) and the ability to tax by region

shopify,$80k/month selling mini surfboards. ($200k Shark Tank investment from Ashton Kutcher/Mark Cuban),"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Steve Watts of [Slyde Handboards](https://www.slydehandboards.com/), a brand that makes mini surfboards (handboards).

**They also had success on Shark Tank, landing a [$200k investment!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYCj4Dcx1MU)**

Some stats:

* Product: Handboards.
* Revenue/mo: $80,000
* Started: October 2010
* Location: San Clemente, CA
* Founders: 2
* Employees: 2

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

My name is Steve Watts, I am the founder and co-owner of Slyde Handboards with my wife Angela. Slyde is based of out of San Clemente, California. Handboards are little surfboards that strap to your hand that give you more lift, speed and control when bodysurfing.

Handboards have been around for centuries, nobody is quite sure where or when they started, but there is evidence of the ancient polynesians using palm fronds or drift wood placed on their hands to get more speed, distance and lift when bodysurfing. A handboard is the perfect ocean toy, which allows anybody no matter their age or skill level the ability to ride a wave like a pro. Handboards are the most portable and lightweight wave riding equipment, which means you don't have to be the local pack mule when going down to the beach  It is a sport that is super easy to learn and safe for kids to get comfortable in the ocean, without having the worry of a big board. As with any awesome sport it’s fun to master, plus it’s perfect for getting barreled. Our handboards allow you to take your ocean fun to the next level. We also have pro-models that are ridden by the very best bodysurfers in the world at some of the best surf breaks, like Pipeline and Waimea in Hawaii to Australia, Brazil, and beyond.

Since we LLC’d the company in late 2010, Slyde has grown. We’re doubling in revenue every year. We were on Season 7 Episode 24 of Shark Tank, where we were fortunate enough to land a deal with Mark Cuban and Ashton Kutcher, who are still both very much involved in the company. 

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

The Idea of Slyde Handboards started back on the beaches of Cape Town South Africa where I grew up. My Mother would take me and my brother down to the beach a lot to get us out the house. We spent most of the time bodyboarding or bodysurfing. We used to find all sorts of objects that we would use as a planning device to get us a little more speed and lift on the wave from frisbees to flip flops, some worked well others not so much. It wasn't until my teens that I decided to break open an old surfboard and re-use the foam to shape into a mini handheld board that would later become the very first prototypes for Slyde. 

I figured we were the only ones doing this, but It wasn't until I went travel surfing around the world and met other surfers and water men and women and heard their stories of growing up using all sorts of found objects like lunch trays or even making boards themselves. It was then I realized there was a possible opportunity to create a brand around this awesome growing watersport movement, as no other company was doing this.

There is definitely a defined problem that we solve, in that a handboard is easy to learn, hassle free and fun to take to the beach. The idea was really born from simple enjoyment that I was having using one. It felt almost selfish to not share it with the world. It turns out I wasn't wrong, because almost immediately we started to form a community and movement as more and more people started to find out about us either online or through friends.  

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

I have a degree in Product Design so my strength lies in the creative design side of the business, from the start that has been my focus. I also grew up immersed in surf culture and it was always my dream to own a surf related company. Prototyping was obviously a huge part of this company. By the time I decided to launch it, I had been prototyping for 16 years and knew exactly which shape board we were going create. 

We live in a very connected world these days and finding manufacturers in general was not a problem. Finding the right manufacturer was a little more tricky and we have been through 5 or 6 Manufacturers since launch. We found that in many cases the small size of the boards was actually a problem. All the equipment was designed and made for bigger surfboards and our boards are no more than 19 inches. A full length surfboard can reach 12 feet. Also, I had always had the dream to be able to create boards with beautiful graphics, but at the time the cost was very prohibitive. This forced us to look at other manufacturing capabilities. In about year 4 we stumbled on a manufacturer that made snowboards and we figured out a way to mix the manufacturing process of a snowboard with a manufacturing process of a surfboard. It took a bit of tweaking, but the result was a board with the strength and durability of a snowboard and stunning graphics. This is why we offer a lifetime warranty on all our high-end boards.

My advice for finding a good manufacturer is to do your research well and inspect prototypes thoroughly for quality. Beyond that make a point to meet face to face and make sure they understand your vision for the product. Watch out for manufacturers that look like they are in it for the short term. 

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

Starting Slyde in 2010 was a little different than it is now. Shopify was small, Facebook was still very new and Instagram had just started the month before.I knew online was the only way to go, so I taught myself basic code and we started our initial website on Big Cartel and had to patch in a cart. We then moved over to Squarespace, finally  in 2013 we moved to Shopify where we never looked back.

At the time of starting Slyde I was teaching surfing in Venice Beach. I had just received my green card to stay in the country and that also allowed me to legally start a business. While teaching a student, I told him all about this awesome company I was trying to start. About 2 months later we met for dinner. He loved the concept so much that he decided to invest right there and then, without even seeing a handboard. Russell is still involved and we are good friends 8 years later.

In 2011 Russell and I bought a Dodge van and made our way across the country from California to Florida to our first Surf Expo. On the way I had a lot of free time and I wrote a lot of tutorial articles and taught myself SEO and those articles, to this day have, been a huge source of free traffic for the website.

For a lean startup (apart from your time) it’s a great way to get free traffic until you can afford to pay for traffic later on. Also building valuable content for your customers is really important in creating engaged visitors to your site. 

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

Our biggest driver of revenue has been our onsite content. We now have about a thousand blog posts and around 20 long form tutorial type articles. These have helped us grow as we are in many cases the first position in Google and Bing for most of the relevant keywords. 

We have also become very efficient at getting press and have been featured in New York Times, Los angeles Times, Forbes, Huffington Post and Business insider. Shark Tank was also a massive boost for us that has helped put our story on steroids.

Getting a really good story written about your company takes more than an email requesting a feature, it takes (in some cases) months and even years of back and forth. It’s important to know what is important to the writer in terms of if your story fits their narrative. Remember these are people that want to write articles that will further their blog or career, so its important to do your research and cater towards their requirements to get the most articles published

We also started using AdWords pretty soon, initially using a fairly modest budget to cover all the keywords that the organic traffic missed. Another core ingredient, has been collecting emails. We have a very solid subscription base that we segment to filter the best possible content into the right place of the customer's email life cycle.

### What are some of the metrics of the business?

The sport of handboarding has grown exponentially since we launched in 2010. There are now competitions across the globe in Hawaii, Brazil, Peru, United Kingdom, Chile, Japan and Australia. We have now sold boards to over 40 countries and growing every month. We have 500k visitors a year to our website. We just got our first order from Dicks Sporting Goods this month.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

Starting and running a company teaches you so much on a regular basis it's hard to list them all. I think above all it teaches you a lot about yourself and what you are capable of achieving. 

Olympic Gold Medalist Michael Johnson once said that the hardest thing he has ever done was to start his business.

As for mistakes, we have been pretty fortunate that we haven't made any really big mistakes or I guess I wouldn't be writing this. Very early on learned the lesson of gross profit margin. It was kind of a funny ""Aha"" moment that was also the turning point for the company to becoming more profitable. I am sure we have missed some opportunities but none I can recall as very memorable. I prefer to work hard and always be looking for the next opportunity than thinking about the one that could have been. I think in general we have been very good at taking advantage of the opportunities we have been given.

I really like the concept of 80/20. I try to focus on the 20% that are going to get the most return every day. It can get tricky when you have a lot of opportunities but generally it is obvious what is going to reap the most reward for the business in the end.

The best decision I made was to bring on my, then girlfriend, now wife Angela, who was instrumental in helping to take the company to the next level by getting all sorts of awesome press, including Shark Tank. Bringing her on allowed me to spend more time on the design, marketing and branding.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

* We have been using Shopify for around 4 or 5 years now 

* We use Klaviyo for email marketing which I can't recommend enough if you want to take your list to the next level. 

* We use Yotpo for reviews which are great however for the starter they are a little expensive 

* We use a few of the Bold Apps on shopify for cross selling and easy sale set up

* We use Sumome for email gathering

One of the biggest opportunities was given to us by Mark Cuban. He offered help with optimizing our Amazon and since that, we have continued to grow exponentially on that platform.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

For product design and development I would recommend any of Tom Kelley books particularly ""The Ten Faces of Innovation"". I would also recommend In the “In the Bubble” by John Thackara.

For good business advice ""The Immutable Laws of Branding"" by Al Ries and Jack Trout 

Also I really enjoyed ""Story Brand"" by Donald Miller.

My favorite podcast are ""Master of Scale"" with Linkedin founder Reid Hoffman and the NPR show ""How I Built This"" with Guy Raz.

For Practical Facebook Marketing advice look no further than ""Perpetual Traffic"".

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Starting a company is not for everyone. Being an entrepreneur seems to be a buzzword these days. The media glorifies the very few billion dollar exits and CEO’s that it almost seems easy. In reality, it takes an enormous toll on you and is exceptionally hard. Don't take the idea to start a company lightly for the most part it isn't glamorous and it's downright hard work. However, if you are willing work hard for a very long time and put everything into it the rewards are amazing. 

My advice for anyone starting a company is to find your ""why"". What makes you keep on working when any sane person would have quit. That special something that fuels your passion and drives you to never ever give up no matter how hard it is.

Another one is: Keep on learning. As a small business owner you need to be the jack of all trades. If it doesn't work, find a way to make it work by teaching yourself. Google is an incredible tool. We didn't know gross margin till 2 years in so go figure.

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

Anybody who has experience with Facebook Ads, Google AdWords and email marketing on Klaviyo.

ecommerce,PayPal TLS 1.2 Deadline - June 30th,"**What does this mean?**
 
Many hosting providers, as well as eCommerce software providers have already moved to TLS 1.2. Authorize.Net disabled earlier versions of TLS earlier this year, on February 28, 2018.
 
Now, PayPal is upgrading the protocols used to secure all external connections made to their systems. Transport Layer Security version 1.2 (TLS 1.2) will become mandatory for communication with PayPal on June 30, 2018.
 
This includes:
 
* PayPal Standard
* PayPal Pro
* PayPal Braintree
* PayPal Express
* and more!
 
**What do I need to do to avoid interruption?**
 
By not upgrading to TLS 1.2, you are putting your business data as well as your customers’ data at risk of hackers. 
 
After the deadline, the services on your website that require the use of TLS 1.2 will stop working, which means your payment processing, shipping calculator, or other real-time data could be interrupted if TLS 1.2 is not in place.",1,10,2018-06-08,ECOM,0.04171707108616829,0.9298854470252991,0.028397487476468086

woocommerce,Different shipping zones and different couriers,"So I'm having a hard time figuring this out. I use two courier services with different prices but their Zones don't include exactly the same countries.

    Courier B sends for 15 euro to Zone 1 which includes the previous 2 countries + 2 more (ex. Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark)

The way I tried to solve this is to create different shipping zones/courier but Woocommerce only display 1 price on the cart page, it doesn't combine shipping zones if they include the same country.

Am I out of luck and do I have to create a shipping zone for each country separately and then define two Flat Rate options?

That's an awful lot of work.

tl;dr if shipping zones have overlapping regions can all shipping methods be displayed on the cart page?

I don't currently have any money saved up so I want to start by selling stuff from AliExpress on Ebay at a few dollars markup until it builds up to enough money to run a Shopify and ads on Facebook and Instagram. I have a few questions and any help/advice is greatly appreciated.

1) Is my Ebay plan viable enough to help me get to where I need to get? Is there anything I need to do to make it work? Also Ebay asks for a legal business name, email, and phone number when registering for a business account, would it be okay to put down a made up name and my personal contact information, or should I sign up for a personal account or register a legal business to start selling?

2) When dropshipping off AliExpress is it okay to purchase off the regular listing or do I need to contact the supplier directly? Is there anything I need to do so AliExpress lets me make as many orders as I need to and ship to different addresses?

3) Can I handle all transactions using a Paypal account or do I need to open a bank account and get a debit card? Will a regular bank account/ debit card work for this?

4) Do I need to worry about taxes or registering my business anywhere? I'm 17 and I have no prior legal experience concerning businesses. Should I contact a lawyer?

5) Are there any better business models concerning online marketplaces? I've done a ton of research on dropshipping and I understand the amount of work and time that is needed to start earning money but I was wondering if there are any other things I can invest my time and money into that would bring in a greater return.

ecommerce,Why do we allow credit card companies to take advantage of us in regards to fraudulent transactions?,"Credit card companies and payment processors can easily implement a way to verify transactions using sms, email, or phone calls. 

Say you get an order that you are suspicious about, you click a button provided by your payment processor that asks the credit card company to to verify the transaction. The credit card company then sends an SMS, Email, or phone call (whichever method the credit card owner designates as the preferred method) that asks the credit card customer to verify the transaction. 

This would be so simple to implement and remove a lot of the risk of selling online.  There should be a law to require this functionality imo. 

It is not fair at all that we have to be responsible for other peoples shitty handling of their credit card information.",32,13,2018-06-10,ECOM,0.024622207507491112,0.9409389495849609,0.03443886339664459
ecommerce,I want to build an eCommerce site but I have no idea where to start,"So I want to build a site to help liquidate overstock items from partner stores in a flash sale like fashion. I imagine the user flow being that the partner sites ping my site with the details of the overstocked item and at that point it goes up for sale for a set amount of time.  The site would be centered around feeds that would show the latest posted items in a given category consistently updating. Given the quantity will often be minimal a user can reserve the item in their cart for 15 minutes after that the item will go back into the feed.

dropship,Review my store + advice/tips on improvement.,"Hi, I just opened my store and would like some criticism, opinions, or just advice in general. I'm constantly adding products to the store, and plan to expand the store as interaction grows.

About 3 days ago, I started experimenting with instagram ad campaigns and manage about 3,700 impressions, but they only lead to about 40 link clicks and no sales. I am not too worried about the sales because I am constantly updating and changing the aesthetics of the website, but I am struggling with building an overall instagram account, and gaining peoples trust in using my website.

Any advice helps, thanks.

dropship,3 Effective Methods for Finding Winning Niches and Products,"Often I get contacted by people new to dropshipping asking how they can find a winning product or niche. It's arguably one of the most important factors in the success of your business, but people still seem to struggle on the topic. So I want to share some effective strategies that I personally use for picking products on my own stores:

1. Hunt for products using Shopify Exchange. For those who don't know, Shopify hosts a marketplace for people to sell their stores [https://exchange.shopify.com](https://exchange.shopify.com). This is a gold mine if you are trying to figure out which niches to get into, because you can actually sort the stores by highest revenue. This allows you to see what kinds of stores are successful, and more importantly what products they are selling. I browse it almost daily, picking winners from various stores and testing them out for myself.


2. Another method I frequently use is to browse domain registries and get a list of trending/popular Shopify stores. From there you can spy on their best-sellers and get a huge list of products that you can try and that you already know sell well! Even if that product is saturated, you get an idea for what consumers want so that you can go on AliExpress and find similar products. A bot I wrote to automate finding winners using this method is [www.nichescraper.com](www.nichescraper.com).


3. Lastly, you can also search through Facebook posts to see what others are selling. Trying typing ""bit.ly get yours"" into Facebook search and you'll see tons of posts from stores pushing their own products. Try different variants like ""bit.ly shop now"" until you find something that catches your eye. You can also narrow the results to show only posts from 2018 in the sidebar. From there just look at posts with positive engagement and you'll easily be able to get an idea for what customers want!

I hope this could be helpful! I just want to note that i’m affiliated with NicheScraper but am a strong believer that you don't need any paid tools to succeed in this business. Its all about working hard and consistently over time.",11,67,2018-06-13,ECOM,0.030350802466273308,0.9300348162651062,0.03961438685655594

ecommerce,Ecommerce Analytics for Beginners - Something I Don't Think We Talk About Enough Here,"Something that I don't see in this sub very often is info on the phases of ecommerce business. So many people jump straight from the Discovery Phase to the Scaling Phase, skipping right over the Validation and Efficiency phases. So I wrote a blog post about how to use analytics to move through the phases in order and grow your business sustainably. Here it is:

There are a million different data points you can track in your ecommerce store. Clicks, conversions, bounces, visitors and more. How do you know what they all mean and which ones to focus on?

The answer depends on what phase your business is in. Typical startup phases work like this:

**Discovery –&gt; Validation –&gt; Efficiency –&gt; Scaling**

Many new entrepreneurs make the mistake of jumping directly from the Discovery Phase to the Scaling Phase, tossing up a store and then throwing money at marketing. But if you start scaling too early, you’re likely to see major losses. You’re only ready to scale if you’ve gone through the Validation and Efficiency Phases first.

In this post, we’ll focus on how you can use analytics to move through each phase and grow your business sustainably.

**Phase 1 – Discovery**

If you’ve already got your store setup then you should have already completed this phase. It involves determining your value proposition, gauging interest in your products and lots and lots of research.

During this phase, you likely won’t have much in the way of analytics to track. Instead, focus on researching and gathering as much data as possible.

**Phase 2 – Validation**

Alright, you’ve found some potentially great products, you’ve got a store setup and you’re ready to start testing. This phase is all about achieving product/market fit. You want to validate that the products you’ve chosen solve a customer’s problem or desire. If they don’t do that, no one’s going to buy them. Use the following 5 metrics to validate your store and products before moving on to the next phase.

* **Bounce Rate** – This is the percentage of people who visit your website and then “bounce” or leave without taking any action (clicking on other pages, making a purchase, etc.). A high bounce rate can be due to poor design, slow page loading time or simply a bad impression.
* **Pages Per Visit** – How many pages does the average user visit during a single session on your site? A higher number indicates that they’re interested in your products.
* **Time On Site** – How long does the average visitor spend on your site? If you’re selling complicated or expensive products, customers may need a bit more time to research and decide if your products are worth the cost. If you’re selling cheap, easy to understand products, customers won’t need as much time.
* **Returning Visitors** – How many people return to your shop after their first visit? People return to shops they like, so a good ratio of returning visitors means you’re doing something right.
* **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** – This simply means how much money you’ll make from the average customer from all purchases they make from your store. If your average customer visits your store twice and spends $100 each time ($200 total), and your profit margin is 20%, your LTV is $40. That means you make an average of $40 from each customer. The higher your LTV, the more you can spend on ads and marketing to attract more customers.

You’ll need to calculate LTV yourself, but the rest of these metrics can be viewed in Google Analytics, which you can setup for free. If you find that any of your numbers are off, put yourself in your customer’s shoes and try to see what they might want changed. Come up with a few possible solutions and test them until your numbers improve.

If you’re really unsure what could be causing your poor numbers, ask others for feedback on your site. You can post the link on the Shopify forums or on the Review My Shopify subreddit.

Once you get those numbers up, you can move on to the Efficiency Phase.

**Phase 3 – Efficiency**

Now that you’ve validated your products, you want to make sure that your customer acquisition processes are as efficient as possible. That means having an easy to navigate website that loads quickly and provides an excellent shopping experience. People want what you’re selling, so make it easy for them to get it!

During this phase, you’ll want to focus on these 3 metrics:

* **Page Load Time** – No one is going to sit around and wait for your pages to load, so your site must load as quickly as possible. Check your Site Speed in Google Analytics to see if you need to improve your load times.

 The most common cause of slow load times is large images. You want to have detailed product shots, but they must be optimized for the web so they don’t slow your site down.

* **Conversion Rate** – This is the percentage of people that went to your website and either signed up or bought something. To monitor this, you’ll want to enable ecommerce tracking in Google Analytics. You’ll then be able to see your conversion rate in the ecommerce report.

 Just like with the “Time On Site” metric, if you’re selling high-end, expensive products, your conversion rate might be 1% or lower because of the complexity of the purchase. But if you’re selling simple, inexpensive products, you’ll want to have a much higher conversion rate.

 If you find that your conversion rate is too low, use Google Analytics to see which of your pages have high bounce rates and low conversion rates. Make sure all of your pages and checkout processes are easy to understand and navigate.

* **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** – This is simply how much money you spend to acquire each customer. It’s typically the highest expense in an ecommerce business. To calculate your CAC, divide the amount you spend on marketing by the number of sales your marketing generates. So if you spend $1,000 per month on Google ads, and that generates 100 sales, your CAC is $10.

 You can divide your CAC by your LTV to figure out the max you can spend on customer acquisition. If your CAC is $10 and your LTV is $40, you can spend up to $30 more per acquisition and still break even. Keep in mind that if your CAC is higher than your LTV, it means you’re losing money.

Once you’re performing well in the above metrics, you can start scaling.

**Phase 4 – Scaling**

So you’ve gotten your site running efficiently and you’ve optimized your customer acquisition processes. Now you’re ready to blow up your bank account! But you gotta spend money to make money, right?

Scaling means investing more time and money into marketing to increase sales. So at this point, you should start running bigger ad campaigns while keeping an eye on all the above metrics plus the ones below:

* **Revenue** – You want your revenue to go up as your ad spend goes up. Duh.
* **Transactions** – Same as revenue. You want the number of transactions to increase as your marketing expenses increase.
* **Unique Visitors** – Again, you should be getting more visitors with more spend.

If all these numbers are trending up, you can keep increasing your marketing budget and keep scaling your business. It’s a good idea to check all your numbers weekly and try to keep improving week after week.

**Conclusion**

If you know what phase your business is in, you know which metrics you need to be tracking in your analytics as well as what steps you need to take to improve your numbers before moving to the next phase. It can be tempting to dive right into the Scaling Phase, but it’s likely you’ll lose money if you haven’t optimized things first.

Once you’ve moved through each phase and are seeing success in scaling your business, you need to continue tracking the metrics listed here to make sure you stay on track. Keep a spreadsheet to track week over week numbers in order to spot potential problems and continue growing your business.",9,33,2018-06-14,ECOM,0.06520101241767406,0.8887252807617188,0.04607371240854263
shopify,$50k/month selling clothes to travelers,"Hey - Pat here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Johanna Denize of Clever Travel Companion, a brand that makes Clothing for travelers.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Clothing for travelers.
* Revenue/mo: $50,000.00
* Started: August 2011
* Location: Remote
* Founders: 2
* Employees: 2

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

My name is Johanna and I own and run the Clever Travel Companion together with my husband. We are originally from Sweden. Nowadays, we live an entirely location independent/nomadic or whatchamacallit lifestyle together with our eight year old son. It has taken a number of years to get to this point, but the goal when starting our company was always to be able to live off of an online based business so we would never be tied down to any one place or work location. Starting and being successful with our company has enabled us to live the life we want. That said it was not always easy and it has taken a lot of work to get here.

Today the Clever Travel Companion funds our travels and our lifestyle and it enables us to spend a lot of time with our son. We do not work full time on our company any longer and we have two employees who help us out with administration. We do all product development and business development and also a lot of press ourselves.

On the other hand we work all the time, and are never off. Finding a balance between free time and work is hard when you run your own business. There are always new product ideas, new projects and new business opportunities to explore. Wherever we travel, we also work, sourcing products and ideas and meeting manufacturers etc.

We are just about to set sail actually - we have spent 6 months getting our teak laden (which sounds fancy but to sailors just means a lot of work) sailboat ready. As soon as hurricane season is over we are heading south to the Caribbeans and then who knows where! As long as we can get access to the Internet, we are free to go anywhere.

We purposefully set out to design our life and business in order to be free like this. It took us many years and lots and lots of hard work, but we can finally say we are successful and have accomplished our goals. We are still growing our company (and working on many other business ideas) but we do not go to an office, we do not have meetings, we have no set schedule and we completely control our own time and life. That was always the goal, rather than making a fixed amount of money or being ‘rich’. That said the Clever Travel Companion is doing well, $50,000 plus a month and growing.

We started the company in a niche we know well - travel. Having been pickpocketed ourselves on our travels we decided to design products that would prevent other travelers from meeting the same fate or from simply misplacing or dropping their money or passports somewhere off the beaten path. Our products include underwear, t-shirts, leggings, hoodies, dresses and scarves, all with secret, zippered pockets to hide a travelers’ valuables. We have all seen the Amazing Race and how almost every season a team misplaces their passports, and went on to lose the race, right? If they had only had one of our products that would not have happened. After all, no one misplaces the clothing (especially not their underwear) on their body! Our best seller these days is our circle scarf with two secret pockets that hide passports, cell phones, cash and credit cards. No pickpocket can get to the traveler’s valuables when zipped and hidden in any of our travel products with secret zippered pockets.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I have always loved to travel. In fact I met my now husband when we were both studying in Moscow. We are both from Stockholm, Sweden, where we had never met, even though we had friends in common. We were in our early twenties and decided to travel together. We went backpacking across Asia, and started out with taking the Trans Siberian railroad from Moscow to Beijing. It was quite an adventure and definitely not luxurious at all. This was in the early nineties and Russia had just opened up. I ended up getting things stolen from me on the train to my great chagrin as we were both poor students at the time.

Earlier, when I was 16, I had spent an entire summer delivering newspapers, starting at 4 in the morning, every single day. I had saved up to go to London. In London I had my money in my inside pocket, yet somehow a pickpocket got to me. I lost my entire savings in a matter of seconds (there were no credit cards in those days for kids). I was pretty devastated.

After these incidents I tried all the regular travel safety stuff, such as neck pouches and money belts, but they were just not any good. They are cumbersome, sweaty and just  not doing it for me. I have spent many nights in hostels fretting about my stuff - at 17 I went to Greece with some girlfriends and we stayed in these funky hostels on the roof of a house. It was basically just bunk bed after bunk bed and a shower room. People had their stuff stolen regularly - there were no lockers, nowhere to hide anything. So we walked around with all our money and passports on us at all times and we slept with our bags in our beds. It was exhausting trying to make sure everything was safe all the time. For years I had this idea of making better travel safety gear but life got in the way: university, work, etc.

We both worked in venture capital and the startup world prior to the 2000 .com crash. It was fun and we learnt a lot super fast. As young, newly graduated ‘professionals’ we got to do what usually takes years to do: we were CEOs of startups, we had employees, offices abroad and managed a lot of money. Unfortunately it all came crashing down and we never lucked out and cashed out as many others had time to do. We still had to work and were broke again. For many years we worked as consultants to startups and we also tried, to various degrees of success, starting new ventures.

When our son was born we decided we did not want to ever go back to a 9-5 desk job or live conventional lives. We wanted our freedom and most of all we wanted to spend time with our son, not have him taken care of by others every day and only see him at night. We also wanted to see more of the world. We wanted to travel. We decided to overhaul our life and become nomadic for real, rather than try to find somewhere to settle down. We had tried settling down and renovated house after house in hopes that it would be the one. Alas we always felt a need to move, to see more. So we decided to become nomadic. To do this we needed a business that would comply with our lifestyle. We decided it was finally time to start our travel safety company.

We had already designed the first products. We had been to China a few years earlier looking for bag manufacturers and we knew a lot about the sourcing process in China. We started working on all levels at the same time developing the product and building a website and all that comes with a startup.

As for validating the product, we based it off our own experiences and also talking with fellow travelers. We had thought about this product line for years and we knew the market and that it was a good idea.

It is funny, in the nineties it cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, to build  an ecommerce platform for a startup and it took months to complete. With today's ecommerce software it is is just around 30 dollars a month, and you can have a rudimentary looking store up and running in a day. It is amazing how this sector has developed. After some research we decided to go with Shopify. This was 2011 so even Shopify was pretty new at the time. Setting up the store was easy, it is pretty much self explanatory. Getting the first shipment of products however, took much longer. We went through many iterations and quality checks for the first products, until we finally had what we wanted. Our first products were mens and womens underwear with two secret hidden pockets to store money, credit cards and passports.

Why underwear? Our initial thought was that the traveler needed to be able to completely hide the valuables and to also be able to sleep with the stuff hidden and never misplace them. After all, who misplaces underwear?

Our research showed that upwards of 50% of travelers at some time either lose or get their belongings stolen when traveling. It is a huge problem for insurance companies, reimbursing theft and loss. We decided that our first product should be something that truly worked and that would be fun for the press to cover.

We initially did everything ourselves, the site, the designs etc. We are completely self funded, and we ran, and still run, everything very lean. There is not much one cannot do or learn to do with some effort put in.

I clearly remember our first sale. Everything was set up, the site, the logistics, and I had started doing PR by emailing travel writers. Our first article mention was in Australia, in the Sydney Morning Herald. We woke up one morning to several orders from Australia but we couldn’t find the source online. It turned out there had been a small notice in the offline newspaper and that tiny notice worked and immediately translated to sales. After this initial small success, getting more PR was our goal. I emailed everyone I could find. I sat down and researched travel writers names and emails. It took forever and it was just hard work. Many writers do not offer their email addresses online if at all, and it takes quite a lot of research work to find them  I reached out to hundreds of writers. Eventually it started to pick up steam - the travel editor at LA Times covered us for a gift guide just before Christmas and that really helped.

It was very, very slow going and I spent countless hours doing media outreach, mainly just emailing writers and bloggers. Most never replied, most ignored me, and many probably never even opened the email (these days I use MailTrack.io so I know who reads what, whereas in those days it was really cold emailing) but some responded and asked for samples and covered us. Of course some just wanted free stuff and never wrote anything.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

The hardest in getting a new product to market in our experience is finding and settling for a manufacturer. There are so many out there and so many shady or just bad quality manufacturers and sourcing partners.

We initially used an American sourcing company. We wanted to start small, with a small batch and most manufacturers have minimum order quantities that they require. In regards to clothing that means that the buyer needs to purchase a certain amount of fabric in order to make the order viable. Initially, we did not want to / could not do that. So we found a sourcing company from China with US offices (they don’t exist anymore hence we cannot give a recommendation) that could help us with a smaller order. That meant using existing colors and fabrics of course.

We initially ordered 5 color sets and 500 of each for both women's and men's as a trial. The price was way higher than what we pay today, which is normal. The smaller the order the more you pay.

The first order took forever: I am not a designer and we did our first order based on rudimentary drawings off of products I found in stores and basically drew instructions on.

We then drew and sew on them and sent the ‘finished’ prototype to the manufacturer who made the first real prototype. These went back and forth several times until we were happy. We then placed our first order for 5,000 products in all.

As we were just starting out we did not want to get a warehouse for fulfillment just yet. My sister who lives in the UK was our first fulfillment partner. She stored all the products in her garage and fulfilled all orders for us. We thought we would start with Europe and grow from there, but from day one we have sold much better in the US and Australia than anywhere in Europe. We now have a professional fulfillment partner in the US fulfilling all orders.

We quickly realized what worked and what didn’t based on the first batch. We realized that men only want black, gray and white underwear. Colors look great on the site but no one buys them. Women want pink and black and gray. When we knew the idea was working, we knew we needed to expand the product line. People clearly liked our idea and saw a need for our product, they got it and just like us they did not like money belts or fanny packs. So we expanded and designed tank tops and t-shirts with pockets. As these took off, we soon developed new designs. For every order of new stock (we place 2-3 large orders a year now) we have added a new design. Our last addition was a t-shirt dress with two secret pockets. Before that we added circle scarves and leggings, We are currently working on about 5 new designs. These days we are much more professional, both in regards to design and in regards to the tech pack (i.e. size charts, quality, sewing instructions etc.). We have learnt it on the job and now know quite a bit about both fabric and sourcing.

When starting out the most difficult thing was finding the manufacturer and especially one that would supply consistently high quality. We are on our fourth manufacturer now. The first in China started delivering lesser quality by the third order. We then, though recommendations from a friend at a Swedish children's clothing company, found a manufacturer in India. They did an excellent job for 3 years but their staff turnaround is huge as all the competent project managers leave to get married. Last year they failed to meet all delivery times and also messed up some sizing so we have been forced to look elsewhere. When looking for a new manufacturer we sent them some samples and asked to copy them exactly and give us price quotes, we then wear and wash and dry the samples repeatedly to check quality. If they stack up, we proceed with a smaller test order. After all, this is a lot of money per order and we need to know the manufacturer gets it all right; from quality to sizing to colors to packaging to shipping. Just packaging products for shipping, is a whole side career: you have to get SKUs, packaging labels, quantities, sorting just right. Many fulfillment centers, and especially Amazon, get very upset if the packaging, documentation or labelling of incoming shipments is not exactly right, which translates to more costs.

Last year our Christmas order arrived in February, making us miss out on the Christmas sales. That can not happen again. So we now have two manufacturers, one in India and one in Turkey.

Many people, especially in the US, want to manufacture in the US. I get that it is a pride, a solidarity thing and I completely understand that. That said, we are not Americans and we have no greater loyalty to any one country -  we sell all over the world and I believe all counties can do an equally good job and also deserve the jobs equally. The quotes we did receive from American companies were so high they would simply not be feasible for us at our size anyways. The US quotes are more than double what India can offer including shipping and customs.

Our startup costs were low. We have no office. No fixed staff. Initially we did everything ourselves, absolutely everything from site design, to photography, to product design to accounting to legal. The only fixed start up cost was setting up the LLC. The other costs were getting our first prototype and buying lots of samples to test out. Setting up the store was 30 USD. Of course the first order was a huge cost. We paid about 30,000 USD for it. It was a gamble and scary but in the end it worked out!

These days we have two staff. One works on fulfillment and manufacturing and one works with administration/customer service. Both travel full time and the work is completely online. We also hire freelancers through various freelance sites for site design, photo editing, bookkeeping, etc. We use a fulfillment center in the US called Efulfillment Service INC out of Michigan. It is our third fulfillment partner. The others were ok initially, but they both got sold to larger entities and completely lost their customer service and response times and they also kept increasing shipping and packing costs.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

Creating a website is easy and inexpensive these days - it is the easiest and most fun part of launching a store I think. The site we have now is our third design. It is completely focused on our target audience, which after a few years of being in business, we now know are not city people, overly trendy people, but regular folks, who worry a tad when traveling, middle to high income, friendly, open minded. The design reflects this and we have purposefully set out not to be especially trendy in the design, by this I mean adopting the omnipresent minimal hipster design. We aim to appeal to a large set of audience in design of site and products, and also in regards to product design and sizing, for example we have sizes ranging from XXS to XXXL.

We have worked in the startup business before but always in larger companies as part of a venture capital group. The Clever Travel Companion is a mom and pop shop and completely lean, leaner than anything. It was entirely funded by our own money: when we decided to leave Sweden and travel, we sold our house. That money funded the company and we basically used it all to live off of whilst launching: had it not worked we would have been broke. Again. It was a few hard years getting things to where they are today, where we can live comfortably and not be completely financially exposed all the time.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

When we started in 2011 social media was not as big of a thing as it is today when it is completely ubiquitous. Initially we only had the site, but we soon started Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram accounts. We have never really used Twitter. Pinterest never did much for us. Facebook is what works best, but that too is slow compared to selling via the site and Amazon. Facebook ads can work but they take a lot of work tweaking to get it right and maintain good ROI. Google ads are the same, a lot of work and money in order to see results.

Since day one we have worked on getting press coverage. It is a lot more difficult today than it was just a few years ago. Journalists and bloggers are inundated with press releases and request for coverage, making it very hard to be seen and stand out. It takes a lot of work: First finding appropriate writers and blogs and then finding contact information, writing appropriate and personalized emails and then following up. That said, it is totally worth it. Our growth is mainly based off of press coverage. Our customers are not as active on social media as let’s say the younger generation is. We track our sales and see where they come from - it is about 75% directly derived from reviews. Of course everyone wants an ad or coverage that goes viral, or for Oprah to put you on some list, and so would we, but it is difficult and it is not something that you can count on. We just keep plugging away at the press as it consistently delivers, press coverage is what works and every press mention is directly transferable to an increase in sales.

We also work on affiliates - we have close cooperation with some bloggers and they plug our products in exchange for a percentage of sales.  We do not pay for coverage. Many, many bloggers do want money in exchange for coverage, but we want honest, real reviews of our gear. We want the people plugging our gear to know what it is and actually like it. We supply free samples of course.

We have a pretty good SEO set up at this point: Our favorable press coverage and our blog, which we really try to work on. We write about anything travel related and we try to be relatively SEO focused. In sum, we focus on organic growth rather than paid marketing and so far we have been pleased with the results. That said, we are always open to trying new strategies, apps and what not. Getting press is never ending and it is crucial to always be seen in new places, in order to increase sales.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

We have a steady stream of customers and we are slowly but surely growing every day. We are always thinking of new products. The only thing slowing us down is the design and the prototype process which is slow. We have to find manufacturers and then make our designs come to life. It takes many reiterations to getting things right. We will be launching 5 new product in the next year or so. We are also transitioning staff. Our current admin/service rep is moving on to another project with us and we are welcoming a new addition.

We would like to see sales increase and are constantly working on that. Eventually we would like to discuss a sale or merger. We are entrepreneurs and love coming up with and starting new concepts. As the Clever Travel Companion grows it takes more of our time, leaving less time for developing new ideas and projects.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

There is no golden rule for starting a business. Read all the entrepreneurial books you want, but in the end it is all about getting things done, getting up and doing it. Anyone can do it, but I think many people do not realize how much work it entails to get a business off the ground. We just see the Shark Tank and Silicon Valley success stories, and they make it look so easy, and fast. But that is not reality - most businesses are small, family run, time intense projects. It takes work! We are grateful and happy to be where we are today with The Clever Travel Companion. That said, we have worked very hard and many, many hours to get here and to have the lifestyle we now get to enjoy.

The worst aspect in my opinion is dealing with unreasonable customers. Most people are friendly, nice and understanding but every so often we get difficult customers and there is really no way of dealing properly with them. No matter what you do they will give you bad reviews and mess things up. For example one customer was very upset that we shipped her order with UK mail rather than USPS to Australia (even though UK mail was cheaper and faster). She messaged several times a day and was very angry and demanded discounts and all kinds of things. When the package arrived (one day faster than estimates) she was furious that the package was left on the porch. Because of all this she gave us scorchingly bad reviews everywhere she could. Now of course we tried to explain that we cannot control Australian mail services but she blamed us for everything. This is just one example but all companies get customers like this. They take a lot of time. A lot. And they always leave bad reviews no matter what one does.

We have a policy to always reply same day to all messages. Always. We are always polite and helpful and if a customer is unhappy we do everything we can to fix it. If a package gets lost we reship, if a product doesn’t fit we exchange/refund it etc.. But for some people it just isn’t enough, they want to yell and scream and mistreat someone. We still haven’t figured out how to manage it. It is time consuming and unpleasant.

On the other hand, many customers expect to be treated badly by online retailers and are surprised that we actually care and just by listening and trying to help in any way, many customers end up pleased and friendly. We get many return customers simply through providing great customer service. This often takes the edge out of complaints and anger that the customer has saved up. We try to make every single customer happy.

Also, we get the scammers. People claiming things never arrived or that things arrived broken. Yes, things get lost, but not often. All our products are inspected before shipping so the chance that they arrive default is slim. We still get people demanding refunds and claiming things are broken. And despite tracking info saying items were signed for and delivered people demand refunds saying their package never arrived.

We just chalk it up to losses and expect it, but unfortunately this happens more than we would like to think.

Another negative is dealing with large corporations, such as Amazon. It can be very time consuming and frustrating.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

There are so many great tools out there but we try to keep the ones we use to a minimum. Many tools can make you and your business a lot more efficient but too many tools can also create issues by themselves. There are always compatibility issues when different tools do not update on the same schedule, some needs integrating with other tools etc. Shopify is our ""home"" and we try to keep integrations to a minimum. That said, we have great use of the tools that we do use and change them from time to time when something that solves a certain issue better comes along.

We mostly sell through our own site and through Amazon and are now starting to really get into wholesale as well. We have also tried selling through eBay and have ""stores"" on Pinterest and Facebook but that is not really working well for us at this point.

You can’t really talk about selling online and not mention Amazon - Amazon probably has an impact on every single e-tailer out there, either as a sales channel or as a competitor. Amazon is amazing at driving sales but selling through Amazon adds to the administrative burden and, above all, raises the frustration level. We already sell all over the world through our own site but also through Amazon in various countries. We do sell quite well through Amazon, but working with Amazon is a mess: Their system is cumbersome and honestly, completely messed up. Getting changes on the product listings is impossible. We tried Amazon Vendor Central, where Amazon purchases stock directly from you. That did not work well for us and slowed sales markedly. Unfortunately, after we went back to Fulfillment by Amazon and regular Amazon sale, i.e. where we sell and fulfill ourselves, Amazon has completely messed up our listing and we are having to spend a lot of time getting our own listings back in order to clean them up.

Issues like this is something you will always have to deal with, every time a third party gets involved, so much work and time is taken from real stuff, like developing the business. Honestly, we would love not to sell on Amazon, but they have too many customers for that. The Amazon customer service for sellers is non existent and they do not help in any way which is sad; I truly believe that Amazon could increase their own revenues to even more epic levels if they worked more actively with streamlining and simplifying the system for sellers (as well as themselves).

Here are the bulk of the other tools we use:

* Store: Shopify (and few of native apps like product reviews)

* Email: MailChimp (mailchimp.com)

* Popups: Privy (privy.com)

* Affiliates: Refersion (refersion.com)

* Customer Service: ZenDesk (zendesk.com)

* Insuring suspicious orders: Riskified (riskified.com)

* Mail tracking: MailTrack (MailTrack.io)

* Payment gateways: Shopify and Paypal

* Accounting: Quickbooks Online (quickbooksonline.com)

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

We have read all the typical books; Tim Ferriss, Seth Godin, startup and entrepreneur magazines and blogs. They are inspirational of course, they get you pumped up and excited and makes anything seem possible and attainable. But they are not real life, and there really are very few books with concrete advice for small, lean, one or two person, organically growing, self funded companies like ours - which is probably the most common type of company. What is lacking in my opinion is information on how to do it: We have spent so much time researching and solving problems. Problems that I know many others have already solved. I would like to see a book with real, hands on advice, step by step how to’s: how to get press, how to talk to customers, how to get prototypes made, how to successfully buy ads on Facebook and Google -  with real examples, not fantasy ones. Most companies do not blow up and grow to millions in sales in a few years, most companies grow steadily over years. Most books only say ""do lots of PR"", do Google ads and “it will happen”. Yeah, right, I know that, but how exactly? No one says how to reach the journalists in this day and age, no one explains how ads really work and what pays off. So anyone writing a book, use more examples, interview more real entrepreneurs on how it is really done in small, one or two man run operations where the founders do it all, where there is no marketing team or PR team, just you doing all the grunt work yourself.

We would love to read more real life stories with concrete information on how to take the business to the next step. That said we purposefully do not want to grow in regards to staff and size, we want to keep it lean and easily manageable. More staff does not always translate to more sales, but more staff does translate to more time, more problems and more costs. So we want to grow the Clever Travel Companion as much as we possibly can within in the confines of keeping it small.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Initially we worked every day and every evening. It was very hard work. Some people just do not get how hard it is to make a product visible - there is so much stuff out there. Yes, some companies are lucky and hit the jackpot and get excellent coverage from a major source early on, but it is seldom a cinderella story and certainly not something you can count on happening - you just have to do the work, the press reach outs and it takes effort and time. If you have a good product, don’t give up, keep at it!

The main mistake we see others doing is spending too much money: They hire consultants and specialists for everything. That way the company will take forever to be profitable. Keep it lean, learn to do things yourself and, above all, get to know your business with all the processes involved, your products and certainly your customers - without knowing that there is not way to hire help should you want to, you need to know the basics to be able to be in control.

The concept is easy, the plugging away is not. That said, we are working for ourselves and building something for our family. If we had regular jobs we would be spending just as much time, but we would be making money for someone else. So why not go for it and work for yourself?

My name is Cole Horton. 23 year who just graduated with a degree in finance at University of New Orleans. I tried the eCommerce game a few ago a failed due to my lack of understanding in the market. I'm back again and this time trying to sell the most common ecommerce product around... t-shirts! my website is uncasualclothes.com (we have a FB Uncasual. and IG uncasualclothes.) Anyway, I opened the store about two week ago. ZERO sales. I made sure to grow a somewhat big following before opening the store and even spending around $200 on ads to drive traffic to the pre-opening. After opening the store I ran a couple more ads and ZERO luck. I'm not saying i'm going to give up, but I certainly am a little puzzled as what to do.

ecommerce,Best way to set up paid subscription newsletter site?,"Hi All,

So I've got an idea for a paid subscription newsletter and want to put together a site to get people to sign up. While my background is in e-commerce most of my work has been with physical products so I'm a bit unsure of how to do this. Looking for some guidance.

Basics: Weekly email newsletter, monthly paid subscription with a discounted rate for an annual commitment. Automated recurring billing.

What is the right platform? I've worked on Shopify/Magento/Wordpress-WooCommerce in the past, am most comfortable with Shopify and would prefer it but considering I'm only offering 1 'product' and envision my site being only a couple of pages max I'm not sure this is the right move.

Plug-ins and such? What plug-ins would you recommend? I want to offer monthly or annual billing (charges should be automated) with the ability to easily cancel any time.

Email provider? I'm most comfortable with Mailchimp and figured it would do the trick but am open to suggestion. As people subscribe their email address should be automatically added to the subscriber list.

Anything else?

Feel free to ask any questions if I'm not clear on anything or whatever.

Thanks in advance!",9,3,2018-06-14,ECOM,0.029789485037326813,0.9384060502052307,0.0318043977022171

ecommerce,10 Reports to look at in Google Analytics,"The journey of exploring your digital analytics data needs to start with clear understanding what is digital tracking, what are important KPIs to track for your business, and how this data can be accessed in Google Analytics interface.

Don't get caught in reading hundred of blogs telling you that these metric ""A"" and ""B"" are the most important metrics to look at, or most important reports to analyze. Metrics and reports mentioned in the article might apply for that specific use case, but you need to be careful in understanding how and what metrics apply to your business. At the end of the day analyzing none important metrics is not much better than having no metrics at all.

**What is digital tracking**

The process of tracking user behaviour on the site is accomplished by Website Tracking platforms. There is a big number of tools that can do website tracking, like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Mixpanel, Hotjar, Kissmetrics and so on. (Check our preferred platforms list in ""the tack"". I won't go into details about how to implement web tracking on your site, but ensure you have correct codeblock snippet in the section of each of the pages of your site. There is a handy google tool to verify Google Analytics tags on the pages: https://get.google.com/tagassistant/.

Web analytics tracking works by sending data back to Google Analytics server on every interaction visitor performs on the site, like page views, button clicks, form submissions. We would also advice to track your conversion events, so it is possible to calculate conversion rate for different traffic sources, and optimize campaigns for better ROI. We specialize in implementation of precise event tracking for the events that matter in your business.

Once data is delivered and stored on the Google Analytics server, it is processed to create reports and dashboards.

**Report groups**

It is important to remember, not all reports are equal and majority of reports can be categorized into 3 groups: Traffic Overview, Visitor Acquisition, and Events and Goals.

*Traffic Overview*

These are the reports that provide an overall overview of traffic volume to your site, page visits, top events happening. They offer an eagle eye view into health of traffic of your site. You will be able to quickly answer questions like:

* Is my site traffic growing month over month?
* What where the top events happening in the last week?
* What was the ratio of mobile users to desktop users to my site?

*Visitor Acquisition*

Understanding performance of different traffic sources, that drive to your site is the job of ""Visitor Acquisition"" reports. Reports in this group can tell you effectiveness of your paid or email campaigns, status of your SEO performance. These are the questions for this group reports:

* How effective was our last week's email campaign?
* Is SEO work we are doing proving to be effective?

*Events and Goals*

Page interactions is another aspect of website tracking. Depending on the site structure, and business it is important to understand what makes visitors stay on pages and convert. A lot of times it's interactions with buttons, forms, insurance calculators (for insurance pages) and so on. Every interaction that brings visitor one step closer to conversion should be tracked and analyzed. Here are some questions that can be answered with these reports:

* What were the top 10 events happening on our site last month?
* How many purchases were there from blog section of the site?
Which traffic source has highest conversion rate?

**Reports to look at**

*Site Content All Pages*

""All pages"" report is a good starting point for all analysis. Looking at the trending performance of the pages helps you quickly get a bearing on what to explore next. The report will help you get insights into possible problems on pages, seasonality of visitors that you might need to be prepared for, or simply can help you measure traffic growth month over month. Pay attention to difference in metrics performance like Bounce Rate and Avg. Time on Page between pages of the site. Consider investigating how each page influences your visitors, and whether it helps with the final conversion.

*Landing and Exit pages*

Understanding starting and final pages of visitor's journey is essential. When visitor starts their journey on a specific page, you can make an assumption about what they were looking for, or which campaign did they land from. Combine number of landing page views with bounce rate metric, and it will give you a hint on how effective these specific landing pages are at capturing visitors attention. Lower bounce rate - possible higher conversion rate down the flow.

Exit pages on the other hand could indicate problem portions of the site, that drive visitors away. Analyzing top 5 exit pages might help understand negative experience visitors are having with the site.

*Behaviour Flow*

Visitors navigate through pages on your site based on their previous experiences with similar sites, and based on navigation hints provided. Sometimes you will find that the flow visitors go through is not the one designed initially. Understanding why that is happening, and further optimizing pages to direct traffic as required will help improve conversion rates.

*Page Timings*

Keep an eye on page load speeds. It is important to keep page load times low. This will not only improve visitor experience on the pages, but will also help with SEO. Search engines like google will always rank fast loading pages higher. Sometimes a wordpress plugin update or a rouge JS library can cause change in the load times of the pages. This report allows to keep an eye on this important metric.

*Channels*

It is important to drive traffic to the site, to expose more people to your awesome product. But not all channels drive the same qualified traffic, or at the same rate. Sometimes you can be getting lots of paid clicks and eyes to the site, but email campaigns actually drive better converting traffic. Keep an eye on the channels report to understand what is the mix of the traffic you are getting, and cater your content to the audience.

Pay special attention to conversions by channel. This metric will help you identify traffic with high ROI, which will make your campaign spending more efficient.

*Referrals*

Referrals report is like a more detailed version of Channels report. It will show you where visitors are coming from by domain. It can be very valuable if you are starting to build backlinks that drive to your site. Comparing traffic change and paying attention to new domains that appear in this report will help in understanding how effective other sites at driving visitors to your pages.

*Network Referrals*

When site's traffic heavily depends on social referrals, do not skip ""Social - Network Referrals"" report. Report will help you measure impact of different networks, and will help you understand which social networks closely match your intended audience.

*Top Events*

Event in simple words is ""interaction"". Who are the visitors and what they do on the site is critical in building a visitor portrait. Visitors engage with the site through events like email subscriptions, purchases, form interactions and so on. Defining which events drive KPI conversions is important. Tagging interactions with events is not a trivial task and should be done carefully. Make sure events are not double firing, or firing when should not. In our experience, cleaning up and setting correct event tracking is the first thing we do for our clients. Without accurate data, there will be no accurate insights.

Look at the top events happening on your pages, and correlate them with goal conversions. This way you will understand which events push visitors one step closer to completing a conversion.

*Events Flow*

Visitors not only influenced by pages, but also events on said pages. Events flow report provides information about most common path of events happening on your site. Analyze this report and try to understand what events precede KPI conversion. It is possible before converting, visitors were influenced by on page events!

*Goals Overview*

Goals, or KPIs is the Google's way of identifying the most important events on your site. Before you will be able to see any goals happening in this report, additional settings adjustments will need to be done in the admin section of Google Analytics. You can configure a range of interactions to be considered goals. If you need help in configuring and identifying goals we are always here to support your business on analytics front.

Remember digging into reports without understanding what you are trying to achieve is not the best course of action. Take a sit back, analyze and understand what is essential in tracking for your site, and use this guide to answer the questions you are looking answers for.",2,5,2018-06-15,ECOM,0.036577172577381134,0.9297798871994019,0.033642963506281376

ecommerce,$35k/month selling photo prints,"Hey - Pat here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Patrick Ryan of The Canvas Works, a brand that makes custom photo prints.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Custom photo prints.
* Revenue/mo: $35,000
* Started: January 2007
* Location: Ireland
* Founders: 2
* Employees: 5

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hello! I’m Patrick Ryan and I’m the founder and MD of The Canvas Works. We’re a small, independent photo printing website based out of Kinsale in County Cork, Ireland.

Right now, the things that are taking up most of my thinking time is the development and launch of our international websites and our native apps on iOS and Android.

For almost all of the past ten years, we’ve focused exclusively on our domestic market. In that time, we’ve built a very good reputation as a small, independent printer of photos on canvas, framed prints and photo prints. I guess we’re best known for canvas prints but we probably do as much framed prints as canvas these days.

We do everything in-house so we can keep a tight focus on quality control. We also focus very heavily on customer service - so we’re contactable by phone, give great advice on photo suitability and help the customer through the process of creating the very best print from their photos.

Our customer base is very wide - from mums and dads, through to corporates, artists, photographers and public bodies or charities. What they all have in common is that they value a high quality product, a very good online experience alongside professional and friendly advice.

Last year we decided to dip our toes in the water of international markets and so we embarked on a strategy to develop stand-alone sites for the US and UK markets as well as native apps on iOS and Android. The sites have just launched and the new apps roll out later this summer. It’s too early to tell if we’ll be able to pull off the international sites but our experience with the iOS app (we launched version 1 last year) was promising.

For what was always intended to be a lifestyle business, we’ve grown it to a reasonably comfortable monthly income of $35k with peak months hitting $50k but we’ve still got a long way to go and there is great potential for scalability and growth.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

So my background was in Law. I left University with my law degree and was intending to get my professional qualification and practice but I didn’t enjoy the practical side of law as much as the academic side. I changed course and spent ten years in the advertising industry in the UK and Ireland before I founded The Canvas Works.

It was around the beginning of digital photography - pre-iphone! I suppose working in an industry like advertising gave me an insight into how huge digital photography and printing was going to be and I could see the potential for a personalised print product. What I didn’t see was the difficulties that would lie ahead in terms of building out a scalable business, investing in digital assets like apps and websites and the challenges of working in light manufacturing, competing against big international players with scale, buying power and big marketing budgets.

I had a little seed capital from a house sale and just bootstrapped from the very start. It’s pretty much been organic growth all the way through. We had a good start but the financial downturn of 2008 that swept through Europe and the US nearly took us down. Spending and the wider economy collapsed in Ireland around that time. We survived and things began to pick up again around 2012/2013. It’s been steady year on year growth since then.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

Our core products are relatively straight forward. The trick is sourcing good base materials, developing good relationships with suppliers and then tightly managing costs.

For our canvas prints, we’re known for our very wide range of sizes - so we need a supplier who can deal with this. The same supplier has worked with us to prototype and develop our plywood mount panels which are very popular.

Another area that has taken up my time quite a lot is finding a good packaging supplier for boxes. Due to our wide range, we need a number of different box sizes and they have to be capable of withstanding a long shipping journey overseas. We also want them to look nice - it’s taken up way more time that I could have imagined and it’s still not right!

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

Our first online store in 2007 was a pretty basic affair, built on asp.net and using a CMS that was built in-house by our web agency at the time. It was expensive to update, inflexible and began to lack features that I knew I needed in order to stay competitive.

By 2012, I was convinced a hosted ecommerce solution was a better choice for a small business like The Canvas Works and I began researching the options. I quickly settled on Shopify.

From there it was a case of finding the right partner and after speaking to a few agencies, we settled on one of the top UK Shopify partners and have been with them through two development cycles now.

The first Shopify build took about 4 months to develop. We took the decision to integrate with a number of third party APIs to handle key pieces of functionality. Filestack handles our file selection and we used Aviary (now Adobe Photo Editor) for our image editing. That turned out to be a double edged sword - the functionality was great but last year Adobe announced they were ending support for the editor so we had to change course in version two.

The second version of the site was developed through 2017 and into 2018. It formed the basis of our US and UK sites and will be rolled out to Ireland over the summer. This development phase was an opportunity to learn from where we’d maybe gone a bit wrong with the first build. Overall, I’m much happier with it but it’s been a long time in development - the best part of a year.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

The two most effective sales and marketing strategies we use are e-mail marketing and SEO / Blogging. Google PPC also pays its way. I’m less convinced about social media but maybe I’m just not doing it right. We’ll see.

Over the years, we’ve tried all the usual marketing techniques deployed by all small businesses. I’ll list them here with a quick summary of what I think of each:

* PR articles: Hard work to achieve, limited return, no long tail. I don’t seek it out anymore - they usually come to us.

* Facebook: Unproven, expensive. I’m not willing to pay for likes.

* Twitter: See above.

* Pinterest. No interest.

* Instagram: Probably the one we should be focusing on. But will likely end up like facebook - pay to play.

* Mailchimp: Hands down the best value for money, generating a massive ROI. Works every time - we e-mail once to twice a month.

* Blogging: Very effective at driving traffic over a prolonged period of time. We are going to focus on this.

* SEO: Our .ie site gets good organic ratings. Building good SEO for the international sites is the next big challenge.

* AdWords: Expensive but effective.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

Overall, I’m pleased with our progress but as a small business owner, you always see the threats and challenges and rarely have the time or inclination to pat yourself on the back. There’s loads to do and I haven’t been quick enough or effective enough at getting the job done.

This year I’ve been able to hire an Operations Manager so I can hand over more of the day to day operational responsibility. My hope is that will allow me to focus on the web development and app development and concentrate on gaining some traction in our international markets.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

Of course you learn a lot about yourself - your own strengths and weaknesses and what you like and don’t like.


You can be lucky with timing our unlucky - recessions can hit you at just the wrong time and take you out. There are just so many ways a small business can fail - it’s a wonder anyone ever sets one up!!

But overall, here are my three key takeaways from my experience so far:

**1. You need to get good people into your business because you can’t do it alone**

* That’s much harder to do than I could have ever imagined. I’ve spent most of my time working in my business when I should be working on my business. I hope I can change that over the next year.

**2. Scaling a light manufacturing business organically is incredibly difficult**

* Making things is time consuming and hard. You’ll have a degree of churn with people so you’re constantly training people.

* Plus you’re inevitably competing with bigger organisations who are way ahead of you in growth and size so it’s hard to get a toe hold in the market.

**3. Focus! Learn to say no and don’t expand too quickly into new products and markets**

* The temptation is big to chase growth by taking on new products and markets because you think there’s a pot of gold there. I may be guilty of this with the push to international markets. You also need to choose a model and stick with it. We turn away jobs now that might give a short term revenue boost but will ultimately distract us from our long term goals or disrupt our business model if we take the job on.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

We’re big Shopfiy fans and have blogged about this in the past. They don’t get everything right - their initial Mobile Buy SDK wasn’t great. Shopify POS has been patchy to say the least. But they’re investing in the platform and making constant improvements so we’ll stick with them.

As regards apps, we use YOTPO for reviews and find that to be very good. We use Spently for e-mails and Privy for sign ups.

We’re big users of Dropbox for business and Google Drive for storage.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

Not enough time to read business books or listen to podcasts. When I read, it’s mostly fiction so I can get a break from the business!

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Set realistic goals and expectations. If like me, you want to set up a lifestyle business, don’t get carried away with all the BS of startups, who are looking to create a global brand in a few years. There’s nothing wrong with having a small business that ticks along, never gets into debt and pays the mortgage!

If on the other hand you want to create the next big thing, you’ll need a totally different approach to finance and set up right from the very start.

Think about it carefully and try to listen and take good advice. Then try to enjoy it - that’s easier said than done, too!",8,19,2018-06-17,ECOM,0.03562423959374428,0.9197997252146403,0.04457602153221766
shopify,$35k/month selling photo prints,"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Patrick Ryan of The Canvas Works, a brand that makes custom photo prints.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Custom photo prints.
* Revenue/mo: $35,000
* Started: January 2007
* Location: Ireland
* Founders: 2
* Employees: 5

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hello! I’m Patrick Ryan and I’m the founder and MD of [The Canvas Works](https://www.thecanvasworks.ie/). We’re a small, independent photo printing website based out of Kinsale in County Cork, Ireland.

Right now, the things that are taking up most of my thinking time is the development and launch of our international websites and our native apps on iOS and Android.

For almost all of the past ten years, we’ve focused exclusively on our domestic market. In that time, we’ve built a very good reputation as a small, independent printer of photos on canvas, framed prints and photo prints. I guess we’re best known for canvas prints but we probably do as much framed prints as canvas these days.

We do everything in-house so we can keep a tight focus on quality control. We also focus very heavily on customer service - so we’re contactable by phone, give great advice on photo suitability and help the customer through the process of creating the very best print from their photos.

Our customer base is very wide - from mums and dads, through to corporates, artists, photographers and public bodies or charities. What they all have in common is that they value a high quality product, a very good online experience alongside professional and friendly advice.

Last year we decided to dip our toes in the water of international markets and so we embarked on a strategy to develop stand-alone sites for the US and UK markets as well as native apps on iOS and Android. The sites have just launched and the new apps roll out later this summer. It’s too early to tell if we’ll be able to pull off the international sites but our experience with the iOS app (we launched version 1 last year) was promising.

For what was always intended to be a lifestyle business, we’ve grown it to a reasonably comfortable monthly income of $35k with peak months hitting $50k but we’ve still got a long way to go and there is great potential for scalability and growth.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hi - my name is Alanna Banks and I’m the owner of Fridays Off Fabric Shop. Fridays Off is an online fabric store based in Toronto, Canada that supplies fabric enthusiasts, quilters and makers with beautifully curated modern fabrics.

In addition to that, we operate a monthly fabric subscription club where subscribers receive one-of-a-kind bundles of fabric every month.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Before starting Fridays Off I was an Account Director at a public relations agency where I ran PR campaigns for consumer product brands.

After returning from a year long maternity leave I found it difficult to juggle my new life as a mom working in the confines of a 9-5, I also came to the realization that the corporate life just wasn’t for me and became very unhappy. I was tired of faking it and really just wanted to follow my forever dream of doing my own thing and being my own boss. So, I did what anyone would do in that situation and got pregnant again ;)

Knowing I had another year-long maternity leave on the horizon, I started brainstorming e-comm business ideas. Then, in December 2012 it hit me. I was going to start an online fabric store carrying all the fabrics that I loved from my local brick and mortar fabric shop. I already had a blog called Fridays Off where I would ramble on about stuff, so the domain name was already established. I was a mediocre sewer and knew a little bit about fabric, but had the marketing and PR savvy to really sell it.

At the time there was almost no competition in Canada, but because I followed a lot of sewing related blogs and belonged to sewing related groups online I knew there was definitely a demand. People were tired of paying high shipping rates from online fabric shops in the US and wanted to shop Canadian.

I listened to these online conversations, researched the popular US shops and modeled Fridays Off after them with the goal of providing the Canadian customer with cool modern fabrics at competitive shipping rates.

### Describe the process of building the initial store.

I launched Fridays Off Fabric Shop in March 2013 using Shopify, just four months after I came up with the idea. I built the site myself using a free template, took all my own photography and wrote all the web content. I used my blog to announce the new direction of the website and posted the announcement all over my personal Facebook page asking friends and family to broadcast it for me.

I bootstrapped the whole operation, using whatever I had in my bank account to buy my starting inventory of about 20 bolts of fabric. It took three weeks to get my first sale (oh that felt good!) and I ended up with a total of five sales that month.

The first few months I treated Fridays Off more like a side hustle than a business because I wasn’t making any money. I remember my sales being so far a few between that we would ring the bell every time I got a sale. My first few months resulted in only 16 sales and a revenue of just over $700 (sad face). To be fair I had a major full time job in PR and was on my way out on maternity leave with a 2.5 year old in tow. I didn’t really take it too seriously, but I also desperately wanted it to succeed.

Fast forward six months, with a newborn I decided to participate in the largest crafting trade show of the year to get my brand noticed and talk to potential customers, also build my email list. It was there that I met the editor of Style at Home, a major Canadian interior design magazine.

This introduction resulted in Fridays Off being included in a feature story about the booming industry of online fabric shops in Canada. This helped legitimize my brand and put me on the map as a major fabric player in Canada and I saw my sales grow by 600% in 2014.

With that, I knew I had something good and decided to quit my job in the PR world and focus solely on Fridays Off. I needed a better recurring source of income to convince my husband and myself I had made the right decision. I had a lot of inventory that wasn’t moving so I started brainstorming ideas to get rid of it without running a big clearance sale. Subscription boxes were becoming popular so I started researching fabric subscriptions in Canada and nothing came up despite there being several in the US. I replicated what I saw businesses doing in the US and started Le Club Canada’s first fabric subscription club. It took some researching and digging around to find a subscription app that was compatible with Shopify. I started off with Recurhub, but later switched to Recharge. I blasted the link out to my meagre email list as well as my social media accounts and within the first month I had 15 subscribers to send to, from there it kept growing. Now we send to a 100+ subscribers and it represents 15% of my monthly revenue.

Fortunately, we live a fairly modest lifestyle and my husband was 100% supportive in the early days/years. Without that, I don’t think I would have been able to grow this brand in to what it is today.

It was also at this trade show where I started gathering names for my email newsletter list and distributed loads of business cards. From there, I did two more tradeshows and saw another 300% increase in 2015.

### How have you attracted customers and grown the business to where it is today?

I can’t really say that I have a go-to platform for attracting customers, but one that works really well is email marketing. I have worked hard to build a substantial email newsletter list and I send frequent emails to my customers. I read somewhere that email should represent 20% of your sales so I work hard to keep up with that number. Our newsletter list has grown to 11,000+ subscribers and the majority of it has come from email lead capture pop-ups via Mailchimp and Justuno. We started out with MailChimp, but last year switched over to Klaviyo for our email newsletter platform. I send out at least one email per week with content like new arrivals, sales and pre-order information. My goal is to send out more content that’s less about the store and more informative. I’d like to have a better mix of salesy stuff and sewing related content.

I’m still trying to figure out Facebook and Instagram ads, but regardless I’m very active on both platforms and make it personal when posting content. I have a good mix of personal content and fabric to show that I’m a real person behind the brand. I have embodied Fridays Off and that resonates with my customers.

I just started a brand ambassador program on Instagram. I put a call out for people to apply who would be interested in receiving a discount three-month subscription to Le Club in exchange for 2 posts about the subscription in Instagram per month for 3 months. I had about 50 applicants and picked four. The programs is kicking off in June and I’m hopeful it will attract to customers.

Learning as much as I could about search engine optimization has been really helpful.  In the early days I read Shopify Empire, The Definitive SEO Guide for Shopify by Josh Highland and followed everything that book discussed. I had a basic knowledge of SEO from blogs but the book really solidified things for me and gave me a step-by-step guide to get things done.

I googled my keywords every day until I got to the number one spot on the first page and I’ve probably edited my meta description 100 times to get that number one spot. I’m constantly tweaking the site to better optimize it and make sure Fridays Off comes out on top for Google searches.  What seems to work for me is getting the write keywords in my meta description, keeping the content fresh on my site and writing meta descriptions for each product listed in my store. It’s a pain but it’s pays off in the end.

Coming from a PR/client service background my top priority is communication. I treat every customer like a client and I want them to understand that every step of the way. I have an extensive order confirmation email that communicates everything that they might be wondering.

I am super friendly in all of my correspondence with customers and send them a personalized thank you email after their first and second purchase using my email service provider Klaviyo.

The fabric I sell in the shop is premium quality, designer cotton. It’s the kind of fabric you want to keep. It’s so pretty you’re too afraid to cut into it. The fabric drops seasonally by collection in the same way fashion designers launch their lines. This anticipation creates excitement among fabric fiends and provides lots of visual content for Facebook and Instagram as well as email marketing campaigns. I ride the coattails of this excitement on social media and have an eye for curating beautiful bundles of colorful fabric.

My priority from day one has always been the customer.

Instagram and Facebook, email marketing, SEO and killer customer service.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

I’ve learned that not everything is going to work the first time or the second time for that matter. Resilience is key. I’ve had many failures but I just keep getting back up and trying again.

I’ve also learned that competition doesn’t matter. I do like to keep my finger on the pulse and listen to what they’re up to via social media, but it doesn’t influence my strategy or business plans.

### Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?

I recently moved the shop into a new studio space and have hired an employee to help with cutting orders.

This has opened up a lot of extra time for me to work on building the brand and the business. My goal is to increase the subscription base and add new products. I’m using the time to focus on creating more content for my email newsletters like creating automated flows and weekly email newsletters. I’m also starting a brand ambassador program on Instagram (mentioned earlier) to increase exposure of my brand and Le Club. I’m looking at expanding my product offering and carrying more sewing related items such as scissors and sewing machines. I’ve already started carrying irons and ironing boards but haven’t put much effort behind marketing and advertising these products. I’m also going to start selling Fridays Off branded merchandise and plan to run a design competition to get customers to create fun sewing related sayings to be printed on t shirts etc.  

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

* Shopify - Ecommerce platform.

* Klaviyo - Email marketing.

* Recharge - Recurring billing and subscriptions.

* Justuno - Pop-ups and conversion marketing.

* S Loyalty - Rewards and loyalty program.

* Yotpo - Product reviews and site reviews.

I also **love** listening to podcasts. My go-to right now is Unf*ck Your Brain. When I first started out I listened to Shopify Masters Podcast a lot. I also listen to Masters Of Scale.

I also recommend reading Shopify Empire, The Definitive SEO Guide for Shopify by Josh Highland.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Just go for it! You can think about your idea forever but if you put the idea into action and figure it out as you go at least you’ve got something started.

Massive action! Keep taking action until you get the results you want. Failure is not an option.

Consider hiring a coach. I worked with a retail coach in 2017 for about 6 months and it was extremely helpful. She pushed me to take action on ideas I had been thinking about and gave me a lot of great ideas that resulted in increased revenue.

ecommerce,[Best Practice] My new tested Facebook ads that work,"**Background**

I want to share some background so you would understand my practice. I'm a digital marketing freelancer and currently working in a online dancing course project - Vietnamese market (The link of the website is in the comment. No promo - just for you to understand. It's in Vietnamese, you can use Google Translate to translate it into your language)

The goal of marketing is to push people to fill out registration form, then a salesman would approach and turn those contact into customer.

\----

**My test - For the message**

I have tried both message functional values &amp; emotional value:

* *Functional value: Be in good shape, sexy body...*
* *Emotional value: Be confident, modern girl*

But unfortunately, all are bad!!!

I decided to take a step back to think a little bit about what the customer really need &amp; what advantages my online course has over offline course. I read all the comment, inbox on my fanpage &amp; on related topic forum, found out that an offline course is really time consuming, while online course does not. So I try another message:

* *""For The Busy Girl Only | Online Dance Class""*

And YES! It work quite well. Now it's time to test the ad set

\----

**My test - For the ads set**

At first, I try using

* *Facebook click-to-web ads*
* *Optimize for click*
* *Interest target.*

The result is awful, 99&amp;#37; bounce rate with time on site of 5 - 6 second. I had only 1 - 2 register per day (result in 0 - 1 customer per day)

I try another way to optimize:

* *Facebook click-to-web ad*
* *Landing page view optimization (As definition of Facebook, it would show ad to people who are likely to view my landing page).*

It resulted in time on site of 10 - 15 second, 95&amp;#37; bounce rate, looks better, but not enough!

After one month running click-to-web ads, I only got around 50 registers

Should not give up right now. I go on internet to read some Facebook ads article, and find out about **Look-a-like technique ( I put the link to those references in comment).** I have Facebook Pixel record all register event/user. I create an audience with those registered user and create Look-a-like audience from it. Continue with:

* *Facebook click-to-web ad*
* *Landing page view optimization*
* *Look-a-like of the converter*

Result in 3 - 4 register per day. Still not enough, but at least I have hope that I were in the right direction. I go ahead and try another round:

* *Facebook conversion (according to Facebook, it show ad to people who are likely to convert from my website)*
* *Conversion optimize*
* *Look-a-like of the converter*

You know what? I still keep it running until now with 15 - 17 register per day (Cost per register is $1), about 30&amp;#37; - 50&amp;#37; of those register converted into customer

\---

**Facebook explain:**

According to Facebook definition, my ad is, like, showing to people who have similar to the previous converter and also are most likely to convert from my site.

\---

I also want to test more Facebook ad to increase my results. If you have any practice, please share. Thanks so much",10,6,2018-06-20,ECOM,0.027797378599643707,0.9129102230072021,0.059292346239089966

dropship,How to ship to a customer from home,"Hello everyone,

I noticed how many people on YouTube ans various courses on the internet talks about how to for example ship a product directly from AliExpress to your customers country, instead of shipping it to themselves at their address and shipping it to the customers from there.
It really sounds great to do it that way, the only problem I have with it is, that I already have my products at my home - so when someone buys from my store, how can I ship it to them the most effective and best way?

So I'd like to start out by saying that I'm a beginner to facebook ad's and have only worked with them for about a month. I've taken a course and have found it really helpful and have been able to go from not knowing how facebook ads work to being able to really analyze data. I'd like to ask insights from you guys. I run a online jewelry store. I currently have a large collection of jewelry and have decided to use Facebook to increase my sales and really be able to advertise to an audience of targeted individuals to sell to. I want to clarify that i don't sell ""Cheap"" jewelry, its actually really good and can stack up against high end shops, It's just affordable and not marked up. I have currently ran 2 ads this week. One instagram ad which I saw no results in (But that was really for me to understand how to make an ad) and my real ad, a $5 Facebook ad. The facebook ad is here https://imgur.com/kWREU1c. I've decided to cover the name of my site because I don't want to look like I'm promoting on this sub, i simply want help. I understand that a $5 ad will never get conversions, and if it does, it's likeley over a long period of daily $5 ads. I've however been disappointed in the result, only 2 clicks! That's a $2.50 CTR! I tried to really understand my audience but I guess I was wrong. In audience insights, I decided to try to narrow down my audience and try to get a small likeley to purchase audience instead of just a large one. Here's my ad specs.
Objective: Conversions Event: View Content (Website) Age: 18-44 (I found most converting people in this age group) Time: June 19th 6PM -&gt; June 20th 6pm. Location: Los Angeles +25MI (Probably should have been all California) Education Level: Highschool, College Exclusion: People who like my page And Must also match: Interests: L.A. Live or Tiffany &amp; Co. And Must also Match: Relationship Status: Single, In a relationship or Married.

My placements we're on Feeds and Facebook Marketplace. Where did I go wrong? Any help is appreciated. I truly want to improve and would be willing to learn any suggestions. Currently, i'm fine with not making a sale from an ad but rather gaining an high converting audience I can later then target to when I do want sales. Again, i'm a beginner so go easy :)If you can, please suggest things that would make my site better.  thanks in advance!",11,6,2018-06-21,ECOM,0.025045840069651604,0.9228637218475342,0.05209048092365265
shopify,Can I have my own physical inventory AND dropship from the same Shopify store?,"Hi folks,

Apologies in advance if this is in the sidebar, or somewhere on their website, but I can't find a definitive answer.  

The situation is this:  I have a lot of real physical inventory from a past business in my possession.  But I'd also like to dropship new items/products.  I'd like to do this from the same Shopify store.  Is this possible?  And how is the processing handled?  

Example:  Customer orders a belt I have on hand (my own physical inventory) and also orders a dress from my dropship company from my store.  

I have no idea how that would work.  I think I know how it would work separately.  The dropship orders are sent to the dropship company, I'm notified, but really do nothing.  A physical inventory order, I get the invoice, I pack and ship.  But will Shopify handle both from the same store?

dropship,Need help with abandoned carts/checkouts,"I launched my store a little over a month ago (May 18) and I feel like I've learned a lot in this relatively short amount of time but one thing I can't seem to make sense of is my conversion rates. Here's what my stats look as of today: [Online store conversion rate](https://i.imgur.com/2P9oVWc.png)

You can see that \~27&amp;#37; of my carts go to checkout and \~33&amp;#37; of the checkouts actually end up being a purchase, which in the end comes out to be a \~91&amp;#37; cart abandonment rate. The internets tell me the average is around 70&amp;#37;. I'd imagined that the abandonment rate for a dropshipping store would be a bit higher, but I feel like \~91&amp;#37; is unusually high.

I don't feel like our niche (a very specific kind of baby clothing) is the problem. We have an active Instagram account with 815 followers and good engagement on our posts, a Facebook page with 1,781 likes (though it's gaining \~600 new likes weekly now after some ad tweaking) and 1,794 followers. We have a mailing list that gains 25 new subscribers daily on average and we're hovering right around 300 sessions a day on our store. Maybe I'm biased, but there seems to be a good amount of interest in what we have to offer.

We run a three-email series for abandoned cart recovery. The first email is 30 minutes after the abandonment occurs and it's a simpler reminder that you've left items in your cart. The second email is 24 hours after abandonment and it offers a 10&amp;#37; discount. The third email comes after 72 hours and offers a 20&amp;#37; discount. We've recovered a few, but not as many as I'd hoped for.

I've browsed this subreddit, read copious amounts of articles online, and watched what I feel like is every dropshipping video on YouTube and for the life of me I can't figure out what I'm missing. We offer free shipping on all orders, product pricing is clearly displayed on product pages, and discount codes from Wheelio are automatically applied so I don't feel like the abandonments come from a surprise pricing when they go to checkout. We have a dedicated shipping information page linked in the footer of every page on our store as well as a shipping summary directly below the ""Add To Cart"" button on every product page. We don't hide our long shipping times during any part of the funnel so I don't feel like that should come as a surprise during checkout and cause an abandonment either. We have trust badges on the product pages and the checkout page and we support Google Pay, PayPal, and Shopify Payments.

I'm not particularly upset about the number of sessions we see that are adding things to carts. I can improve that as I get smarter with my advertising over time if I need to. What I'm concerned about is only a third of my checkouts actually converting. I feel like if the customer adds items to their cart, clicks to checkout, and begins the checkout process by filling in their information there's clearly a willingness and intent to buy but the majority of them just up and leave for seemingly no reason. We've had 55 orders and all three of the payment providers have successfully been used, so I know they work.

Has anybody experienced something like this? Is it normal? Were you able to fix it? Does anybody have any ideas of things I can look into that I have't already mentioned above?

Sorry for the wall of text but I just wanted to lay everything out there. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",15,2,2018-06-22,ECOM,0.048126839101314545,0.9170420169830322,0.03483109548687935

What I really want is a Page, that has a Parent Category and hence appears at a certain place in the Product Category sections, is this possible?

woocommerce,Composite Products / Components Sale Price issue,"Hi

This tip:

https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/composite-products/composite-products-tips-tricks-and-snippets/#section-12

Doesn't quite do as it claims:

""Prevents Composite Products with component discounts from appearing as on-sale""

As it also stops a Composite products with component discounts AND general / base product discounts as showing the SALE! badge.

Regardless of the component discounts, a composite product with a general / base product discount price should show up as on sale?

Any hints on how to change the logic slightly appreciated?

Thanks very much

ecommerce,$2.3k/month selling a functional fashion accessory.,"Hey - Pat here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Susan Costanza of Sleeves 2 Go, a brand that makes Snap-on sleeves.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Snap-on sleeves.
* Revenue/mo: $2,300
* Started: September 2011
* Location: Lake Worth, FL
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 1

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hi, My name is Susan Costanza, I am the designer and founder of Sleeves 2 Go Inc. 

Sleeves 2 Go is an attachable flutter sleeve designed to snap on easily to a woman’s bra strap offering coverage &amp; style of the upper arm when wearing a sleeveless garment. Sleeves 2 Go are done in lightweight chiffon &amp; lace fabrics that mix &amp; match beautifully with may different types of fabric and colors.. It’s a wonderful wardrobe solution for women of any age or size because Sleeves 2 Go are one size fits most. 

Over the years, The Sleeves 2 Go collection has grown into other functional fashion designs such as the slip extender which adds length to a short skirt or dress without having to visit a seamstress. I also created a shrug that is a tubular design done in a stretchy lightweight fabric that can be worn as a shrug or scarf, offering more coverage as a longer sleeve and is a great companion for any sleeveless or strapless garment. I also carry a line of pretty Poncho’s &amp; Chiffon Vests that make for an easy stylish topper for summer outfits. 

My Mission is to help women embrace their own personal style! Whether it is to conceal aging arms, cover a scar, tattoo or maybe a dress code at the office that requires no sleeveless garments. Whatever the reason, we sometimes need a fashion fix-it that provides an easy solution to our everyday wardrobe needs. Creating the look you want is always in style ! 

I started my company with a very small personal investment and chose not to take on any debt or loans. I wanted to build the company slowly and not overextend myself. My company is small but I am happy to say that Sleeves 2 Go has been profitable. 

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I have always loved fashion as far back as I can remember. After extensive years in the fashion industry, and 20 years as a fashion show coordinator &amp; commentator, I’ve found the most common wardrobe dilemma women shared with me was ""Why is everything sleeveless"" or “I don’t like the way my arms look”. 

As women age the arms can be a trouble spot, and most of today’s fashion trends lean towards sleeveless dresses &amp; tops, especially here in south Florida. The only solutions available were to cover-up with a sweater, jacket or maybe a wrap, which can make your outfit look dated or matronly. That’s how the idea of an attachable sleeve was born. After months of research and designing to create a prototype, I finally was able to get the attachable sleeve into production.

My career as a fashion show coordinator gave me the perfect platform to present and demonstrate the Sleeves 2 Go on my models. It was a great way to see how the audience would react after the models showed a before and after demonstration on the runway. The response was so positive, they immediately came backstage after the show to purchase a pair. That’s when I realized I had a great product and that this could open a whole new fashion category for many women.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

I have a background in Art &amp; Design, so I can draw and create fashion on paper but I never learned how to sew. After I designed a pattern and created my first prototype, I then took this to a seamstress who helped me make some changes and tweak the design to get it right. 

It was very important to me that my product is made here in the United States. This led me to the clothing &amp; textile industry in Miami to find a manufacturer. After months of research and meetings, my samples were coming back poorly made and a lack of quality workmanship.

I expressed this issue to a very good friend who had a connection with a manufacturer in Tennessee. When I received my samples back from them I was thrilled! The sleeves were beautifully made and this manufacturer could also handle large orders for me. 

Since my product ""the attachable sleeve"" is so unique and one of a kind, I decided to file an application for trademark and a patent. 

The whole process took about four years to get approved and close to $5,000 in legal fees. A lot of hardwork and determination went into my invention but it paid off and I’m so excited and proud to be the owner of a United States Patent, received on May 31, 2016.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

I chose not to open a brick-and- mortar store and decided to sell my products online with an e-commerce platform. Back in 2011 when I launched my website and started to market my product, I was still working as a fashion show coordinator and did not want to give up that income right away. I was also juggling the responsibilities of being a Wife, a Mother &amp; taking care of a home and 2 dogs. The thought of opening a store was daunting and I was not in any financial position to take that risk. My Husband &amp; I got caught up in the foreclosure wave when the market crashed &amp; we almost lost our home.  It took 2 years but eventually the bank did refinance our mortgage and we were very thankful not lose our home. After that experience our credit was shot. So I took a leap of faith and made a small investment of about $5,000 to get my product manufactured and ready to sell. The e-commerce platform made more sense to me at the time and I could work from my home which gave me a lot of flexibility in my schedule. 

I launched my store with Shopify, a user-friendly website since I’m not very tech savvy. Initially, getting traffic to my store was slow. It took a good couple of years before I saw any profits. 

I made many mistakes but great lessons were learned. For example, not knowing how much fabric to buy and in which colors. At first I decided to make the sleeves available in basic colors such as black, white, ivory, brown and navy. The navy &amp; brown sleeves were just not selling as fast and I ended up being overstocked with them. So I learned eventually what was a popular pick with my customers and went from there.    

They say the road to success is never a smooth one. However, I’m now able to navigate the internet more wisely and use the social media platform for most of my advertising. It offers great exposure for my company without spending thousands of dollars in advertising.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

I continued as a fashion show coordinator for a few more years to still have income while trying to grow my business. 

My background in fashion show productions was the perfect platform to market my product. I already had the connections and relationships with women’s clubs, charities and fundraising events where luncheon fashion shows took place. 

This also gave me the opportunity to take my business and sell on the go as a vendor or a pop-up-shop. One of the tools I use is Go Payment to process my sales and create orders on the go. Taking my company on the road to different locations and events also helps drive traffic to my website because of the exposure I get at many of the larger trade shows. 

About 2 years ago, I started working with a sales Rep at the Trendz Shows.Trendz is the largest women’s apparel show in the state of Florida that showcases clothing, accessories &amp; more, for the purpose of wholesale orders and is open to the trade only. This has given me the opportunity to get better exposure for my company and to get my product into retail stores. Since then, I have opened many new accounts that include local boutiques and specialty stores. I’m still trying to get my foot in the door with the larger department stores, hoping to someday be like Sara Blakely the ""Spanx founder"". Dreams don’t happen overnight so I’m in it for the long haul and enjoying every moment! 

I also use MailChimp a wonderful app that allows you to create newsletters and send email blasts to your customers to promote your store. When a customer purchases from the website they are automatically put on my newsletter list. I also build on my customer list from many of the trade shows I attend. I’ll offer a promotion like ""win a free pair of Sleeves 2 Go"" or if they want to receive our newsletter, they have to fill out their name &amp; email information on a piece of paper that goes into a jar. At the end of the day I pick a winner and have gained new emails. Once a month I send out a newsletter to my customers offering a discount or sale usually around 20% off their purchase. A great way to get repeat business.   

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

Right now I run the business by myself and hire an assistant when I do events or participate in the larger trade shows a vendor. 

I work out of my home &amp; handle shipping &amp; receiving to keep my overhead and costs low. My goal is to eventually bring Sleeves 2 Go Inc. to the next level for mass retail distribution. 

I envision a successful and prosperous future, looking forward to the journey ahead!

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

When I decided to switch careers from being a fashion show coordinator to CEO of Sleeves 2 Go, I went from selling a service to selling a product. So, this has been a big learning experience for me. 

What I learned is that, no matter what you are selling, do it with integrity, believe in your product or what you are doing wholeheartedly, work hard and work smart! 

I really enjoy sharing my resources and fashion advice to help women embrace their own personal style. That’s what inspired me to create a wardrobe solution for women of any age or size. It’s not only about looking good, it’s also about feeling confident!

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

I really enjoy reading and have found these books to be very inspiring and insightful:

- What I Know For Sure by Oprah Winfrey

- And One More Thing Before You Go by Maria Shriver

- The Money Class by Suze Orman

- The Right Words at the Right Time by Marlo Thomas 

This is just to name a few, they are filled with great advice for finding success, fulfillment, prosperity and developing a positive outlook on life.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

If you have an idea for something or an invention go for it. 

Be creative, take risks, make mistakes, it’s all part of the learning process. 

Follow your dreams no matter what other people think and always trust your gut &amp; stay true to yourself.

dropship,"New dropship store, question about fulfillment with supplier","Hello! I'm new to dropshipping , but I'm already finding the dialogue here to be super helpful. I was hoping if anyone could me out!  


I have a supplier based here in the US that is new to dropshipping as well (he has only done strictly wholesale bulk orders in the past). I see the process is fairly straightforward to add products on my Shopify store from vendors featured on apps like Oberlo, but if I wanted to start off with my independent supplier here that is not affiliated on any of the major supplier websites like Aliexpress. What should I do to streamline the fulfillment process and get him set up, as well?

woocommerce,Question regarding bulk deletion of variations,"Hi everyone, 

Just to start off, I'm an absolute laymen when it comes to all things web design. I usually work on the marketing/PR end of my company, but we're small so I get jobs outside my wheelhouse a lot. So if this post is breaking any rules I missed or is a commonly addressed topic please delete it (and if possible point me int he right direction). 

So the product I'm working on, in question, right now is a boot. The boot is available in Mens and Womens sizes, sizes 5-18 in mens and 5-12 in womens, all in Narrow, Medium, Wide, and Extra Wide. 

I've succesfully created a shitload of variations for all the combinations, but I need to delete all of the women's sizes that were automatically created that don't apply (size 13+). 

Now with half sizes and all the width combinations, this is a lot of variations. My options right now seem to be to individually delete each variation (which will take way too long, time my company doesn't have, per se) or delete all variations (obviously not an option). 

My research has shown me this: https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-advanced-bulk-edit/8011417

The description says it can bulk edit variations, but a comment on the demo-video says it cannot. 

Ultimately what I'd like to do is be able to selectively delete bulk variations (like with checkboxes and a delete button). Anyone have any idea if this extension will allow me to do that? If not, any recommendations?

shopify,Triangulation Fraud in a Nutshell,"We are a manufacturer or dietary supplements, a fairly successful brand. We do about 60% of our sales via Amazon, the rest through our Shopify store. Lately we've been getting hit hard by chargebacks and we couldn't understand what was going on.
&amp;nbsp;


After some research, I found that some brand new ebay sellers were listing our products for 25-30% less than our retail price. We do not do wholesale, so at first I didn't understand how they were able to sell it that cheap (we do have various discount codes, they were possibly stacking them?). On my personal ebay account I purchased my own product from one of these sellers. To my surprise, the next morning I found an order on our shopify store under my name. Except that wasn't my billing address. 
&amp;nbsp;


How triangulation fraud works is that the scammer will offer a product for sale on a site like ebay. Unsuspecting customers that are price shopping see the product for sale at a great price and purchase from ebay (can't blame them, ebay offers a money back guarantee). The scammer than uses a stolen credit card and basically ""drop ships"" the product to their ebay customer. The retailer is then left with the chargeback, for a transaction that appears to be legit.
&amp;nbsp;

Shopify has fraud protection built in, but you may need a plugin for more robust management, but ideally you'll have settings that:
Flag shipping/ billing mismatch and put them in ""hold for review.""
Use the AVS system (address verification system). Definitely always have the zip code match. Flag for review if the street number doesnt match but the zip code matches. Decline all other transactions.
&amp;nbsp;

When reviewing, call the number for the order (make providing a phone number mandatory, scammers are lazy and don't set up working phone numbers). If the number doesn't work, then decline the transaction. If it goes to voicemail, I'll usually hold off on shipping the order until I hear back from the customer.

&amp;nbsp;
My last tip is don't get too aggressive with the fraud filters. For example, lots of customers use PO boxes as their address for credit cards. If you declined all transactions that don't have a street address number that matches, you will be declining everyone that uses a PO box in their billing address. Also, know that a LOT of people have their billing address as their home, but their shipping address is their office. Even if the billing address and shipping address are in the same city, that doesn't make the transaction legitimate, recently the scammers attacking me have been finding billing addresses VERY close to the shipping address. 

&amp;nbsp;
At the end of the day, this does require a bit of manual work, and there's no way around that currently. But its manual work you HAVE to do. A chargeback ratio (chargebacks/transactions) above 1% will get you booted from EVERY processor. This is protecting your business.",9,26,2018-06-26,ECOM,0.10540234297513962,0.8718196749687195,0.02277795411646366
ecommerce,7-figure e-commerce site shutting down. Is there anything I can do?,"Hello - I'll keep this short, but would appreciate any advice from my fellow redditors and e-commerce entrepreneurs. 

On the back of a very successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, in which we raised about $350,000 we established a small company to sell a small storage accessory for MacBook computers. 

Over the years we managed to get our product into Apple, create partnerships with 30+ distributors worldwide and amassed a mailing list of over 25k, and achieved middle 7 figure revenue numbers in total. 

We had a great run, but unfortunately a second successful product proved elusive and the first product is quickly becoming obsolete. As a result, over the last several years we have slowly stepped away from the business to pursue other interests and have made it entirely online with one support staff managing it. Naturally sales have dwindled to the point where it is no longer profitable to operate the business. We intend to close the business after all remaining stock has been sold, wanted to reach out to your creative minds out there to see if there were any ideas on how we could potentially make use of the remaining assets, chief among them being a 25k mailing list that is highly targeted to tech enthusiasts who own a MacBook. 

Things I have considered:

1)  Partner with a Chinese manufacturer in some sort of Rev share scheme and allow them to sell their products under our name.

2) Work with MacBook app creators to create digital bundles for the 25k mailing list

Any advice is much appreciated, 

Cheers 

Edit: for clarity purposes, and because it seems to have been misinterpreted, i am not trying to sell the mailing list. I am asking for suggestions on how to leverage the list to pivot the business. I do not have the time or the capital resources to build a new product from scratch which requires expensive tooling and a high amount of risk.",23,15,2018-06-26,ECOM,0.06520536541938782,0.9066312313079834,0.02816341258585453

dropship,"No need for a sob story,I need a helping hand.","I started dropshipping about two and a half months ago. When I say started, I did a website, imported some products, made my website presentable and went for a bohemian style approach. All the products looked good TO ME. 

But once I asked an influencer on IG to promote my products, it did not go as plan because I did not a lot of research on it and the information I got was from people on youtube that practically spoke a lot but said nothing( if you know what I mean). All of this to say, to my surprise, I only got a few visits and not a single sale. Afterwards, I was discouraged because of not having a single sale. 

Now, because of my budget, I am trying to do a lot of research, trying to find whats hot or what I can make hot. In reality, making the website is not the hard part, its getting the right product in front of the right people.

What I need help with from you guys is what are the type of people I should try and learn from and if there is anyone that went through a similar thing and was able to surpass it.

ecommerce,Avoid dropshipping?,"I just recently got a Reddit account and joined this sub, and I've been seeing a whole lot of hate towards the dropshipping model. I understand to some extent—it's a flashy trend that ecommerce platforms and business ""coaches"" use to get some folks hyped on a get rich quick scheme. Seems like a lot of people get tricked into thinking that dropshipping is the secret to easy passive income with little to no effort put in. But does that mean it's necessarily a bad idea to use it?

I've been interested in starting an online store that uses dropshipping. I would be entering into a pretty active, yet fast-growing market. My product is niche to an extent, but not groundbreaking or super unique, and I hope to use some decent targeted marketing to access some of the demand that has already been demonstrated to exist.

dropship,Questions on starting dropshipping,"Hi all, I'm new to the subreddit and just started 2 weeks into reading up on the topic of dropshipping, starting my store and sourcing for potential niche products. Believed I'm committed to venture into this field for the lonf term but I do have the following questiond that I hope fellow dropshippers would be able to share your experience.

1. For those that have been in the dropshipping business field for a while, do you start up with a niche or general store? I am leaning towards a niche store as I do not see how I can position / sell my store uniquely through marketing. Does customers typically only care about the marketed product more than the overall store niche?

2. How many niche products did you begin with in your store before marketing starts? I am concerned of customers expectation of the number of products within the store once marketing starts. For example customer goes into stores from FB/IG ads of a quality product, and only noticed few to little products.

3. Do you happen to buy each and every product that your stores typically sell in order to gauge and review the quality and packaging? Wouldn't this translate to a high cost for each and every product that the dropshipping business would incur upfront?

Thanks to all for took the time to help address some of these questions of mine!",5,8,2018-06-27,ECOM,0.057855892926454544,0.9132394194602966,0.02890472114086151

shopify,$50k/month selling golf simulators.,"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Igor Vainshtien of 24/7 Golf, a brand that makes Golf simulators.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Golf simulators.
* Revenue/mo: $50,000
* Started: July 2016
* Location: Melbourne, Australia
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 3

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

My name is Igor, and I am the founder and owner of [24/7 Golf](https://24-7.golf/) an Australian startup in the virtual golf industry. I sell golf simulators for personal and commercial use and am the distributor for SkyTrak Golf in the region (Australia, New Zealand and surrounds).

When I was 6 years old, living back in the former communist USSR, I started my first business! At an isolated school beach camp in Sevastopol Crimea (Ukraine), I figured drinking water will be in high demand - and it was a booming success! Yet upon my return home, my parents were called into the Socialist Party Headquarters, and chastised for ""raising such a BOURGEOISIE PIG!!!"" and called for a stop to such travesties!

Fast forwarding to a blissful life in “Capitalist Australia,” I started up in business again at 15 years of age - developing websites, databases and network engineering. Joining the DOT-COM revolution at 19, with wishlist.com.au, and after barely scraping through (while working full time!) Bachelor of Information Systems (UniMelb), at 20, I moved into Corporate eCommerce Consulting, and then headhunted by the software giant SAP.

Working for someone did not last long - after 3 years, and working in Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Japan, I started my own SAP consulting firm and from a humble $280,000 in 1st year revenue went to over $4,000,000 annualised after 4 years. But I also burnt out! After a small career break, I went back into consulting and also got addicted to golf.

That led me to investing into a virtual golf centre, then building a brand of unmanned virtual golf centres called 24/7 Golf! Having sold over 1.1m of golf simulators in the first iteration of the business called GolfTec Australia, I partnered with SkyTrak Golf from USA to use at my venues and also to resell. After 18 months of growth in sales I decided to switch to a fully online only e-commerce store … with Shopify! Once I did that, the online store grew and grew and keeps growing!

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Golf is something I only got into 8 or so years ago and have been obsessed with it since! Around that time I invested and operated an indoor virtual golf center in Melbourne, and after 5 years developed a concept similar to 24 hour gyms, but for golf - called 24/7 Golf. Members could sign up and play or practice virtual golf with no staff in an unmanned golf studio.

The business grew a little, and I kept selling golf simulators on the side.

Having partnered with SkyTrak Golf, the sales really took off. I always knew golf simulators would be a hit if the price was right. Originally I was selling them for $30,000 plus, and mostly to commercial ventures (like virtual golf bars) - but they actually didn’t do well at all and most closed down. Retail rents in Australian capital cities are crazy. In our Melbourne location, we were paying $360,000 per annum!

Funnily enough the most profitable part of the business was selling simulators - and in 5 years I sold over 1 million worth of simulators to other indoor centres. Unfortunately most - in fact all of them - went out of business since. The business model just didn’t work.

As the price of simulators started to come down from $50k to $25k then to $5k (my average sale now) it really became apparent that affordability will cannibalise the simulator business anyway so I decided to go into it - all in.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

I did not design the “each product” that I sell - but I did combine them to make up a combination that was really affordable and easy to install for customers. With my old simulators, it was a huge job to install and it was so expensive!

I combined the best parts from 7 years of sometimes painful and often expensive lessons to form a package - or set of packages - to turn that trend around. To set up my supply side, I just called each company and asked to be a reseller. With SkyTrak I asked to be the exclusive distributor and over months of negotiation … I got what I wanted! What I have learnt is that things must be easy for customers - easy to buy, easy to assemble, easy to manage going forward. Everything I do in my sales process is to try to make it all easy for potential customers.

The hardest thing was spending money on products that sometimes didn’t work out. In hindsight it’s easy to say “why did I spend $1000 on that!?” but as you go through the process it’s important to remember that each one of those “mistakes” is a learning investment. If you had perfect information, you would not be here… so don’t sweat it. Easier said than done when maxing out your credit cards!

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

At first I created a simple website in Wix. It was pretty bad but did the trick… it was just an online brochure. People would need to call and I would talk to them. Since I was running the main business I did not really invest time or money into the online sales until 2018.

Then I decided to build a Shopify store (having done a few courses and having heard about it) - I found a template I liked, did an RFP on UpWork for people to build it and after a range of quotes from $2,000 to $15,000 I decided to hire a designer and a developer separately. It only took 3 or 4 weeks to go from zero to a full website and it’s pretty much has been the same since!

Although the website enables people to buy everything themselves, since it is a fairly large purchase, many customers want to talk to someone before buying. So the site is both a sales tool and a lead generation for offline closing tool. The key we find is customer experience must be top notch for both channels.

Now the website gets well over 1,000 visitors a month, which is small in comparison of the “internet” but it’s a great number for what I need the site to be at this point in time. If I had 10,000 visitors I would not be able to process everything and deliver a good experience. Growing super fast is not necessarily a great thing… it’s good to have “quiet weeks” to catch your breath and improve things. It’s very hard to work on improving the site or processes when you’re scrambling to fill orders.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

Initially I didn’t think many people would go to the site. Organic Google search results started feeding visitors after 2 to 3 months.

How I got my name out there though was through a large Facebook group about golf in Australia (35,000 members) and the biggest golf simulator forum on the internet. I just started posting answers to questions and asking questions myself. It took about a year but then my name was known for “golf simulator” stuff. More and more would reach out to me. Then, when people started buying from me - I’d ask them to post on the forum saying they bought from me and to share their experience - hoping it was a good one! And they did… and then “word of keyboard” spread and spread. It took well over a year to really build a name. Then I started sponsoring events run by the Facebook group and now I am well known on it and get a lot of leads from there.

However, 2 months ago I also started Google AdWords and Facebook Ads - and the visitors and sales have really picked up.

Being known in the industry - or what some people refer to a thought leader - is a huge help in driving leads in - they come to you for advice and from that they are usually happy to proceed with the products I sell vs competitors. I never really set out to be a “thought leader” and I don’t have a personal brand… until it happened naturally.

I’ve used forums since the days of dial up internet and BBS (bulletin board systems) and would talk to people online. This is really how you become known. Just by being vocal with useful information - not self promoting fluff. When you know what you’re talking about you can share your knowledge and people will appreciate it. For example I often refer to my competition in my posts about my own products and suggest people try out things because I am confident they will come back to me. And if they don’t… it’s not a big deal. When people see that I am so frank about the products in the market and my confidence in my product line inspires confidence in others… and then they become customers. I’ve never had to return a single simulator - so I have a bit of a track record here to give me confidence. It’s important to note on self reflection that I have always had the confidence - I did not wait for it to come to me.

One of the biggest conversion tools - one that has made me tens of thousands of dollars - is Raven Call Back button. I really want to give them a huge shout out!!! Conversion from that little button is something like 90% … it allows customers to request a call back and we are on it right away. Sometimes a sale is made minutes worth $5,000 or more just from that awesome little button! For high cost items I think it is a must have.

### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

The business has grown 50% month on month this year and I hope to keep it going that way! I am launching an event hire part of the business where people will be able to book a golf simulator for their party or corporate event and hoping to expand that to 22 cities/regions around Australia. It will be a great way for people to have fun but also try SkyTrak and may be buy one after that.

I am also currently spending only $1,000 per month on AdWords, and I want to double that now that I can see results. I am trying to do Drop Shipping only, but as volume increases it’s getting harder to manage all suppliers to orchestrate all delivers. I may need to consolidate in one warehouse and then fulfill.

In addition, I have started partnering with other affiliates to sell SkyTraks (and fulfill events) to grow faster and give me more time to focus working on the business. I also have a great offshore team that manages things for me which I will need to expand to cater for growth.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

I have made SO many mistakes. The key is to understand that the key is to minimize the risk and impact of mistakes, not to try to avoid them like the plague. You simply cannot. What I have learnt is that it’s important to understand the downside and make decisions that do not expose you financially in a big way. I didn’t do that at the beginning and it cost me hundreds of thousands… probably millions along the way. I think I am better at managing risk now and at decision making.

The most interesting thing is that my two most successful ventures I kinda … fell into them. 24/7 Golf being one of them. What helps is loving what I do so that working insane hours is not work… it’s fun!

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

For my shop itself I use:

- Shopify
- CallBack Request by Raven
- Scout Abandoned Cart Recovery
- HelpCenter - Build an Attractive FAQs Page
- BookThatApp

For overall work I use:

- Asana - Task management.
- NimbleCRM - CRM
- Skype

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

So many… I read business biographies all the time. I find that the best lessons in business are in the stories of people who have “done it” - but some of the absolute best lessons are in business biographies of FAILED businesses. For example BooHoo.com was a major disaster that went through $500m or so of VC money. Great book if you can find it.

I am a big fan of Tim Ferris 4 hour series. And some classics like Think and Grow Rich. Another great book that is hard to find but brilliant read is No Cash, No Fear - I think many entrepreneurs will be able to relate to that book (even the title)!

In terms of skills I cannot recommend enough learning how to sell in the “real world” - I think it is the most important skill for any career, in a job or in business. I have devoured hundreds of books on sales. If you learn how to sell offline, you will be able to sell better online I think!

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Learn from other people’s mistakes as much as you can. Seek out people who have been down the path you’re going and take them out to lunch and ask to share. They don’t need to be your “mentors” or “mastermind groups” … just need to listen to their stories.

Make your own mistakes, pay for them, move on. If you want to avoid mistakes, work for a simple company and get a simple salary. Kill your ambition.

Read a lot, watch documentaries, feed your brain with ideas and inspiration. Interesting people have interesting stories, seek them out and enjoy them. Find a way to enjoy life no matter where you are in it - sometimes that will be really bloody hard - just get to the next day and then the next until it’s easier. Too many books talk about the good times and underplay how hard it can be. Many entrepreneurs go through depression, anxiety, lots of fear - but they find a way to deal with it - your skin will grow thicker as the years go by - I am certainly grateful mine has grown thicker.

Find a happy place. I have two… my family who I love more than anything I could have imagined, and golf. When I play golf, I escape from the world for 4 hours - find a happy place (hobby, movies, books … keep it legal! :-) ) and you will find it easier to work harder than you ever thought was possible.

Use nootropics!

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

Looking to expand events business into USA after Australia, starting with Texas.

### Where can we go to learn more?

shopify,Should I get Printful samples first,"Hey everyone,

I'm going to start a print on demand website with Printful integration.

ecommerce,Looking for some insight,"Hello, my name is Devin and I am new to this sub as well as the ecommerce world. While I have years of experience selling on ebay, this is my first venture with my very own store. I started Dude Essentials about 3 months ago and I am off to a rocky start. First I was dropshipping clothing from AliExpress but the Asian to US size difference was irritating and resulted in a decent amount of returns. So I decided to branch out and now I am running a Print on Demand store that sells T-shirts, hats, and phone cases. The theme of the store is positivity, good vibes, psychedelic designs, and body positive shirts. After running a bunch of PPE ads on Facebook and Instagram, I find that my target audience is Californians 18-24, lots of college students with interests like Bob Marley, Beach Vibes, whatever. The problem is I am not getting any sales lately. I haven't had one in a month and it's really discouraging especially when I am spending a decent amount of money on ads. I am getting likes, shares, and followers on Instagram and Facebook which is great and everything, but it seems like I am missing that something that takes them from liking the ad/image and continuing to scroll to clicking the Shop Now button and purchasing the item they are showing interest in. 

So if you wouldn't mind taking a look at my store and/or my Instagram and tell me if you notice anything that's missing or what can be improved it would be much appreciated. I am not posting this in an attempt to promote my store, I am posting as an ecommerce entrepreneur who is generally confused on what they are doing wrong. I know that I haven't been at this long and trust me, I am in it for the long haul. Operating at a loss is expected with any new business venture, but I want to make sure that I am taking the right steps to get where I need to be over time. Also I am sorry this post turned out to be so long, I am having a hard time finding people in my life to bounce ideas off of/collab with.

I see it as the following: 3 months shopify x $29 = $87. Domain $8. I can design a logo myself. Initial product inventory ~$250. ~$55 to get a business license (I'm European). The rest of the money goes to marketing &amp; product photography. Why wouldn't this be possible? Anyone opinions?

ecommerce,A bit of help with payment flow,"I'm looking to create an e-commerce store in the UK to target UK customers (I am from Panama). I am currently setting up an LTD to be able to trade in the UK. However, a couple banks have rejected me because I am a non European citizen. I believe this is just a matter of persistence (but don't know for sure). 

Take into account that Panama is a bit special and we don't have access to paypal (great country leadership and a couple international scandals \[panama papers\] have us a bit censored). I got an Estonian e-residence (which allows me to open a bank account in Estonia). I would rather not take the Estonian route as I think it might be a bit more complicated that I would like it to be. Ideally, everything happens within the UK. 

My business model is simple: find a supplier willing to create my product, do marketing via instagram (or any other mechanism to generate traction), and lead them to my shopify store where they will buy the product(s) and off they go (worrying about upselling and retention later). I intend to use FBA to make the deliveries as my understanding is that it is the most reliable partner to have to manage this. 

My problem / question is around the area of payments. How do they work? Do you connect your Shopify with your bank account and everytime a customer purchases a product you get a deposit? Or do they keep all the payments and give them to you once a week? And what about refunds? How are these managed?",1,2,2018-06-30,ECOM,0.022734541445970535,0.927603542804718,0.04966200143098831
