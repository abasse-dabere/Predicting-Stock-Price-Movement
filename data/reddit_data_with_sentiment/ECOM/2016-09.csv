shopify,Shopify SEO and Etsy SEO,"So I have both a shopify website and an etsy shop.  I've been trying to update both sets of SEO in order to improve the views for both places.  I know that Etsy's tags and titles are critical to that search engine  and that google is different.  However I think I'm getting confused when I do the Shopify SEO.  I see the area on each product for SEO editing but I've filled that area in with a description and a ""catchy"" title but I must be missing something.  Do I need to put the tags here similar to what I do in Etsy?  Or am I right with the description approach?

Also, where do I edit the SEO title tags for the overall website?  And do I need to make sure that all of the pictures have alt text?  I feel very confused.  Sorry if this is the standard set of questions but like I said I think I'm confusing the two separate approaches to the SEO.

I'm looking into making a multi-vendor ecommerce website, wherein suppliers of a similar product category are able to centralise through the site and sell through our platform and I have a few questions:

2) Vendors to apply and require approval

I recently reached out to a number of handmade goods stores to see if they would like to become a dropship supplier on my website.

Most of them have said they would be interested, but only begin offering wholesale pricing at a certain purchase amount minimum. ($150 minimum order for example).

I don't want to do this because it would require me to charge more than the manufacturer, which is bad for my brand and for theirs.

Because I am ordering piecemeal and they are doing fulfillment, what ideas do you have for how to structure this agreement? 

My first thought was to offer a 3/mo trial run and if they aren't hitting a minimum sales target they can dissolve the partnership.

We're trying to migrate our website to a new server. We've been able to move the databases, products and all, however no matter what we seem to try we aren't able to get the associated product images to move with the data. 

We've tried using using WordPress's Import and Export tools and even manually cloning the uploads folder with no success. We've also tried using many [migration] plugins but don't want to pay hundreds of dollars to do that. Our host (GoDaddy) has Installatron too, which we used to plug in our FTP info but it keeps not wanting to clone. We feel so close—can you help?

We are a small lingerie label. We post quality photos of our products and also receive lots of lovely customer photos to share. Our Instagram account has a little under 20K followers but the interactions (likes and comments) per picture don't seem to reflect that. On average, we'd receive about 120 to 200 likes per picture and maybe a few comments, sometimes none. When we introduce something new, the activity increases, to around 350 to 400 likes.

I'm a bit worried because similar accounts with similar follower count get more interactions even though the images do not seem that interesting (like, a stack of fabrics or such).

ecommerce,Need help selling rebuilt auto parts online,"Hey there, first time posting on this subreddit. I currently run and manage auto parts repair shop in LA. We specialize in rebuilding alternators and starters. Currently having some trouble selling these units online and was wondering if anyone could give me some pointers and some direction on how to properly take this business online. More than anything I want to try and do it the right way from the get go.  

Ebay


I've tried using Ebay but find that it is very time consuming putting the parts online so I'm looking to see if there is an easier way. If there isn't another method I could use to sell the parts, I'll just stick to ebay as I have had some success with it but not much. The competition is fierce on ebay. For example: There are companies that sell the same auto part that I'm selling for more or less the same price, brand new except they are made in china and mine are original rebuilt cores for the most part. 

We currently have a website: c1alternators.com with no estore. 

I've looked at a couple of templates but it's been difficult trying to find something simple where customers can search their vehicle using a vehicle application where they fill out info on their make/model/year of the car to find a specific alternator or starter. I've seen it done on websites such as: http://www.bbbind.com/ecatalog.html
anyone know what kind of template I should use? or should I just make it from scratch or use some webmaking software to build it? If so what kind of software would be the best to use? 

Listing


Any one of our auto parts can have multiple vehicle applications for example. a Honda Accord 1991 alternator is compatible with that same car from 1991-1994 so maybe instead of having a vehicle application I can just put the most popular units online for sale, organize by the maker only? Just to make things easier? (Thinking out loud here.)

Warranty


This has been another issue in selling rebuilt auto parts online. We've been in business for over 15 years and it's really rare to see these parts fail but they do fail from time to time. The warranty we offer to people is 3 months not sure how the online market will react to that. I was thinking of making it a limited one year warranty so people have more confidence in my product. Moreover, the parts that I'll be shipping out will have a new regulators, brush holder assemblies and solenoids to minimize defects.   

Shipping 


Shipping can get pricey. These units can get pretty heavy, around 25lbs more or less depending on the unit. I was thinking of sticking to the USPS for all of my shipping needs. Anyone know of a cheaper, more effective alternative? I figure USPS is the standard for shipping? Does it get much better or not really? In other words, is there a way to get a better price than the public signing up with a business account? 

I also have all the necessary hosting stuff required to set something like this up, things like the SSL certificate etc. 

After brainstorming a bit, maybe Ebay would be the best choice to get started with this online project but I'd like to set something up for the long run and not have to depend on ebay to sell parts, maybe develop a website that I can work along with or in conjunction with ebay. Maybe remake the website I have into a straight up estore? 

Any advice on how to tackle this ecommerce/estore ambition would be greatly appreciated. So far I have a good amount of parts cataloged ready to be uploaded for sale on ebay which I'll be working on in the meantime.

shopify,"If there is a God, Please let me Drag and Drop - Webflow, Adobe, Shopify","I'm going to write a long post about my mixed feelings towards Shopify. But for right now, can someone conform my suspicions...

There is no visual editor for Shopify design... right? For example, a WYSIWYG with drag and drop. ie: Webflow, Adobe, any modern web design app ever.

Am I wrong? Man, I hope I'm wrong. 

You see, I want to make a Shopify theme. But I've decided I know enought. I know Wordpress and html/css/js, and how to do such things on 100 different programs. I know, ""Liquid is like the same thing but you just gotta---"" 

I want to drag and drop. Let me drag and drop.

Edit: When I say ""Drag and drop"" I really mean ""Theme Builder"" I guess. For example, Wordpress has stuff like Divi. I have an idea as to why -- there's a lot of money to be made by selling people apps and themes. Apps like ""Shogun"" is $10 monthly (on the low side). 

It's for that reason I left Shopify today. Woocommerce all the way. I wish Shopify would... not charge $10/mo for every option ever.

Shipping certain products from different origins

Hi, I've looked up lot on Google but I can't seem to find a straight forward answer.

My store ships 2 products. One product is shipped from our factory in New Hampshire, where the other is shipped from our office in Rhode Island.

In Shopify, you set your shipping origin from where the shipping rates are calculated from. You can only have one.

This is problem for me, as both products are shipping at the same time, so I can't manually change the origin address when one is shipping versus another.

I need to be able to have one admin panel where the factory in New Hampshire can fulfill orders through our shopify, and where the team in Rhode Island can fulfill orders. I need to be able to do this.

ecommerce,"From Etsy to Shopify, no sales in first 3 weeks!","Earlier this year, I began researching for dropshippers that would print great phone cases and finally found one. I started with an [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/NerdyFab) as proof of concept to see which designs would sell. That went well, I would average around 5 or so sales a week. 

Margins at around $8-10 per case, not bad but obviously not fabulous either. The store was on the side for me as I primarily do freelance web development and this was something fun and on the side for me.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago: I expanded to [a Shopify store](https://shop.nerdyfab.com/) because: 

* Smoother mockup/item creation with more variants (etsy is limiting in this capacity)
* Dropshipping/printing apps
* Actual website
* Now have more time to dedicate 
* Seemed like a good idea at the time

Present day:

Technically, the Shopify is great for me. Super easy to create products, manage SEO, integrate with printers and dropshippers. Practially, I have had no sales on the Shopify store yet, it's been a few weeks. Using shopify nets me less margins, around $5 per item.

I have been working on it every day in some fashion: adding new products, working on SEO, google merchant, research, etc

What I have realized over the last few days, is that there isn't really a ""niche"" here. I'm thinking a store branded with more of a niche/focus/theme would perform better, with similar designs and offerings of course.

I have also tried about $40-50 in Facebook and Instagram ads but those haven't helped much either.

ecommerce,The Definitive Guide to Sourcing Products from China for Ecommerce Businesses,"Hey guys, happy Tuesday. I've got something special for the product oriented businesses. These are tips from my own experience. It's not the only way to pursue sourcing and importing but it's what I've found to produce good results for me so without further ado...

Today, we’ll be showing you how to source the perfect product for your ecommerce or Amazon business from start to finish.

This reddit post contains all of the written content but does not include the photos as photos can't be shown in the post. I've included a link at that bottom of this post to the article with all of the supporting images (which are a lot).

Also, here is the video version of our guide for those of you who are more interactive learners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D-JROz-678(22:50)


**Before we embark, remember these 3 sourcing principles…**

**(1) It’s a numbers game.** More quotes = more information = better decisions.

**(2) Don’t be afraid to walk away.** As the buyer, you hold all the cards.

**(3) Compile your data.** Seeing supplier quotes side-by-side can help you reach a quick conclusion. We’ll show you how to do this later on.

So let’s take action, get quotes, and find our new best-seller!

There are 2 ways to get quotes on Alibaba: Buying Requests and direct messaging (we’re talking about Alibaba today, but these ideas apply everywhere).

Post a Buying Request first. It helps you articulate what you’re looking for and starts working on your behalf while you actively message suppliers.

And hey, if you want to see footage from Alibaba and walk through everything step-by-step, check out the video version of this article.

**POST A BUYING REQUEST**

Alibaba.com has a big blue button on its homepage that says “Get Quotations Now”. Ok.

“Get Quotations Now” takes us to the Buying Request form.

**Product Name:** stuff the “Product Name” section with keywords like it’s Amazon in 2012. It helps suppliers find the request. Jump into the Google Keyword Planner tool if you need more ways to refer to your product.

**Quantity:** if you don’t know the cost per unit, it’s hard to say. You don’t want to set expectations too high, and you don’t want them to pass you by. “500” usually garners ample replies.

**Details:** when sourcing, never portray yourself as the final decision maker (e.g. CEO, President, Founder). Be a Buyer, Purchasing Director, VP of Product Development. Why? It removes the awkwardness of negotiation. Since you’re an employee, you must adhere to a budget. You have no choice. You must have the product specs a certain way. You have no choice. If they’re not talking with the sole decision maker, they can’t control some variables. That plays to your advantage. It also gives you more time to decide (“let me consult with the department”).

**Upload Photos:** upload many photos for reference. If you product doesn’t exist yet, graft a few different images together. Nothing fancy, but be sure to convey the idea.

**Here’s a Buying Request template to save you some time:**

    Hello! This is [name] from the [company] Buying Department.

    I’m interested in buying an initial order of . If you can manufacture them, please send me an email:

    [email address]
    [note: you can’t actually include emails in the request, so write something like name [at] domain [dot] com]

    In your email, please include:

    (1) PICTURES: a detailed set of pictures of your product
    (2) PRODUCT: what is your preferred price per unit/set?
    (3) MOQ: what is your preferred minimum order quantity?
    (4) [SPECIAL MODIFICATION]: what is the price of [custom change you want to make to the product]?
    (5) AIR SHIPPING: what’s the shipping cost to the USA by express courier (e.g. UPS, DHL, FedEx)?”

**Why is this template the way it is?**

**– Use email.** Ask them to email you instead of chatting on Alibaba. Why? To get their email address and to start screening suppliers. If you ask for an email and they only send you a message on the platform, they didn’t follow instructions. That’s not an immediate “no”, but be wary.

**– Numbered questions.** School systems condition people to answer a list of numbered questions in their entirety. Unnumbered or long-winded messages invite unfinished responses, and drag out the conversation. We capitalize the main idea for each point for simplicity.

**– Say “preferred”.** Say “preferred price” and “preferred MOQ” instead of just “price” and “MOQ” in case it’s high and you need to negotiate it. By being framed as “preferred” they are less fixed payments and more fluid figures. This tip alone saves you thousands of dollars in the long run.

**– Air ship.** If your product is small and light, air shipping is fine. If it’s heavier and larger, you might consider the sea shipping/freight forwarding combo. If it’s done by express (UPS, DHL, FedEx), then they’ll clear customs for you, and you don’t need a freight forwarder.

Now, post the request. As you wait for replies to roll in, search your product on Alibaba and scroll for gold.

**SEND DIRECT MESSAGES**

How do you guarantee replies? Write to suppliers with a history of replying. Foolproof.

On the right side of the screen, you’ll see a supplier’s Response Rate. Also, Alibaba Trade Assurance now shows sales numbers. Generally, suppliers with transactions are more trustworthy. Sellers without transactions may also be great, though. Don’t rule them out.

Let’s source “flea collar.” It’s small, appeals to a specific niche, lightweight, brandable, customizable.

**Scrolling down…**

This pink collar has 2 transactions worth $10,000 and a response time over 72 hours. That’s a slow time, but the sales add legitimacy. “Yes” to a message. Why not, right?

This blue flea collar has no Trade Assurance sales and a 72 hour response time. I’d be less inclined to send a message.  

I’d be very inclined to message these guys. Great sales, great response time, great photo. 100% “Yes”.

Let’s save you some more time. When you find a supplier that you like, use this template. It’s similar to the Buying Request, but this time we can include our email address:

    Hello! This is [name] from the [company] Buying Department.

    I’m interested in buying an initial order of . If you can manufacture them, please send me an email:

    [email address]

    In your email, please include:

    (1) PICTURES: a detailed set of pictures of your product
    (2) PRODUCT: what is your preferred price per unit/set?
    (3) MOQ: what is your preferred minimum order quantity?
    (4) [SPECIAL MODIFICATION]: what is the price of [custom change you want to make to the product]?
    (5) AIR SHIPPING: what’s the shipping cost to the USA by express courier (e.g. UPS, DHL, FedEx)?”

    Look forward to hearing from you,

    [Name]
    [Buying Department, Company]

And when you’re sending them a message, change the subject line. There will be a template line in there… but don’t use it!

Use something short; “Order of [Product]” or “I’m interested in [Product]”, or even type the supplier’s first name in it. It stands out in their inbox and gets a reply before the mass of other private labelers. It’s best to send messages at the beginning of the Chinese business day. For California, 6pm UTC. For New York, 9pm EST.

**Send messages to at least 10-15 suppliers. You have nothing to lose.**

Now, you’ve posted the Buying Request and you’ve messaged your top picks. The responses start to roll in. The results? Eclectic.

**The good:** some suppliers will send you an email (not an Alibaba message) answering each of the 5 questions point-for-point are shoe-ins. Treat them well. Tell them you appreciate the prompt response.

**The not-as-good:** some suppliers will send you an Alibaba message with a generic email response, or will ask how they can help. Don’t discard them yet. This phase is all about getting as much information as possible. Simply re-send the original email or engage them on the platform.

**The bad:** some suppliers won’t respond, or will respond days later. Maybe they were at a trade show? Don’t discard yet.

**ORGANIZE THE RESPONSES**

We need a place to organize everything. A home base.

The goal is to get a lot of different quotes. An average will emerge. That way, it’s easy to compare and find red flags. You don’t want red flags.

**Unless you’re private labelling red flags.**

Anyways, crack open a fresh spreadsheet and let’s get going.

Make an Excel doc with 11 different columns. PCs can press Alt+Tab to flash back and forth from this window to your Excel. Mac users can press Command+ Tab. It’s a nifty little trick.

A1: Name of the supplier
B1: Email of the supplier (you’ll have this if you don’t go through Alibaba; and even if you do go through Alibaba, it may be on the supplier’s profile)
C1: Website of the supplier (either web or en.alibaba site)
D1: MOQ of the product, or the quantity you’re looking to order
E1: CPU (cost per unit of the product)
F1: Sample fee of the product (normally, this isn’t in the first template as to prevent confusion, so sort this out later)
G1: Product cost
H1: Shipping fee (the Air Shipping cost to your place, or Amazon business warehouse)
I1: TOTAL
J1: Price per unit
K1: Notes (your personal impression of the communication as a whole)

Now, add these 3 formulas in the 2nd row:

G2: click the G2 cell and then write this formula: =D2*E2. MOQ multiplied by Cost per Unit = your product cost.
G1
I2: click the I2 cell and then write this formula: =G2+H2. This adds the Product Cost and Shipping Fee together for our grand total.

J2: click the J2 cell and then write this formula: =I2/D2. This divides the total cost paid for product and shipping by the number of units you’ll be getting— your true price per unit, with everything accounted for (except for things you need to pay for when the inventory hits Amazon like Amazon’s referral and storage fees, PPC, duties etc.). More on that another time.
Source the Perfect Product for Amazon

**We’re done!**

Congratulations, you now own a universal sourcing template. This makes life SO much easier. Now, you can punch supplier quotes into the spreadsheet and see the total instantly. A lot of sourcing is about how the suppliers’ data sets compare to eachother. Feel free to add or subtract columns from this sheet. You may need to account for more costs than shown here.

But, numbers are only half the equation.

Now that we’ve got the technical side down, it’s time to learn how to spot a good supplier using street smarts.

**A GOOD SUPPLIER…**

Is a manufacturer, not a re-seller.

You may have noticed that the exact same product is offered by different sellers on Alibaba. How can this be? Re-sellers. They (through no fault of their own) need to make money on the re-sale, so they’ll charge a mark-up. Every dollar cuts into your profit, and ends up costing thousands in the long run. Here’s how to screen out re-sellers:

**– PHOTOS.** Ask for factory and facility photos.

**– EMAILS.** Emails like “sales2@companyname.com” indicate a factory as opposed to “nancy@companyname.com”. Not always true, but you should be talking to a member of a dedicated sales department, not a 1-person production. Once you get a good prospect, move to Skype or WhatsApp for faster chats.

**– TOUR.** Tell them your sourcing agent in China is conducting facility tours this month, and would like to stop by (you don’t even need to follow through on this; just see how the supplier reacts). Or, you can do this for real.

**– SKYPE.** Ask them to video Skype you from the factory in an hour. Are they ready?

**– TRADE SHOWS.** Upcoming trade show listings on their site and on Alibaba. If they are willing to appear in 
person, that’s a good sign.

**– DOCUMENTS.** Does your supplier have source documents that only the original factory would have? These include quality control docs that vary by industry (CE, FDA, ISO9001, RoHS, MSDS reports, material test results, etc.) and Adobe Illustrator (.ai, .eps) or Photoshop (.psd) files for their packaging and instruction manuals.

**– BRANDING.** Look at the version of the product everyone’s selling on Alibaba. Zoom in. Is there a visible brand or logo engraved anywhere? Search that brand name online, and you’ve found the original.

**– PRICING.** When you’re comparing prices in the Excel doc, who has the highest prices? This may indicate who re-sells, since they need to make margin on the sale.

**– CUSTOMIZATION.** Factories own the machinery used to make the product, so they can customize more easily than a re-seller can. If you ask a supplier to make a custom physical change and they can’t, is it because their machinery can’t do it? Or, is it because they don’t have any machines to begin with?

**– PRODUCT LINE.** Re-sellers often offer expansive lines of materially different products. Ask yourself: does it make sense for these items to be manufactured in the same factory? If a supplier sells flea collars but also selfie sticks, they’re a re-seller. True factories have breadth in a small area of expertise.

For example, here’s the collar supplier who was a definite “yes” earlier. As you can see, they’re all about paracord stuff. That’s all they do.

Plus, they can offer footage from the factory floor. Another good sign.

**Anyways, where were we? Right. A good supplier… Is thorough.**


**– INSTRUCTIONS.** Use instructions to screen. Professional reps read your instructions and follow them. For example, if you’re chatting on Alibaba and ask them to email you instead and include their company website, pay attention to who follows the instructions and who doesn’t. Pay attention to who answers the 5 sourcing questions point-for-point. Those suppliers are trying hard and deserve your attention.

**– PAYMENT.** Good suppliers connect with payment methods like PayPal and Alibaba Trade Assurance. These 2 methods in particular have some hoops and fees on their end, so it’s a good trust indicator. However, good suppliers may not have Trade Assurance set-up yet and prefer T/T wire transfers, so it’s not a hard-and-fast rule. You can pay for order #1 via PayPal or Trade Assurance, then move to wire transfers once you’ve confirmed the quality.


**Doesn’t need good English or a good website.**

Factories are notoriously bad at marketing. Don’t discard a supplier based on their English or the look of their site. More important than perfect English is their attention to detail, the effort they make to answer your questions, and the area of expertise of the factory.

**Can supply you with a product line.**

Source with the future in mind. Does the supplier you’re considering have an extensive line of products in the same area? In the case of the paracord supplier, order #1 is a flea collar. Once that does well, you can buy collars for cats, paracord leashes, paracord chewtoys, etc. Finding a good supplier the first time saves from having to do this process over again.

**NEGOTIATIONS**

Tips to come to win-win agreements with suppliers:

**– THE ‘HOLD THE BOX’ TRICK.** You’re building a brand and want a custom box. Some suppliers may have an MOQ of 500 products, but and MOQ of 1000 custom boxes (because their packaging guy set an MOQ on it). 1000 boxes means you need to make 1000 units, right? No. Make 1000 boxes, ask them to hold 500 with them in China for your next order, and make 500 units as planned. They meet their packaging minimums, and you order the right amount.

**– THE SAMPLE REFUND.** Pay for samples with PayPal, and ask if the amount can be refunded if you end up placing a mass order. Affirm that they won’t lose any money in the process, and that it will incentivize the Buying Department to go through with the order. You get your sample payment back, and they get more business.

**– THE ‘LONG TERM’ APPEAL.** If you can’t seem to agree on the price, appeal to future orders. “It may seem that this order is worth only $3000,” you say, “but we’re a growing company, and a successful order today may lead to easy repeat business for you: $5000, 10,000, $20,000. What’s the best price that you can offer me?” You get lower prices, and they win a long-term partner.

**– DON’T SAY ANYTHING.** If you stay quiet for a few days, they will follow up. After a few messages, they’ll be more receptive to lower prices. In the end, you are the buyer and hold all the cards. The best negotiation tactic is being willing to walk away from the deal.

**– PRAISE.** If someone does something we don’t like, we tell them. If someone does something good, we say nothing. Break the trend. Praise sales reps for following up, fast responses, good product certifications, quality, service. When negotiations hit, you’ll be glad you’ve set a friendly tone.

**– HAVE A BUDGET.** Set a definitive amount you’d like to spend on the order, and stick to it. With MOQs, modifications, packaging, and shipping, it can be easy to exceed your budget. If anything, share your budget with your supplier and ask how you can work together to make it fit.

**SAMPLING**

You’ve found suppliers, compiled their information, and negotiated the price of the mass order. Now, you need a sample unit to test the quality. Going into a mass order without a sample is… risky. Always sample.

Here’s the anatomy of a sample order:

– sampling fee = the fee for the product. It’s free, unless you make a custom sample.
– custom work fees = fees for custom logo printing, set-up, stitching, mold fees (which can get pricey)
– shipping fee = most likely by air (DHL, UPS, FedEx), and will comprise a good chunk of the sample fee

How much should you pay? Expect anything from $30-$200, depending on the complexity of your product.

What do you do with a sample once it arrives:
– photography (photography first, while it’s still unscratched)
– durability testing (drop test, waterproof, material)

**PAYMENT**

For the sample, use PayPal. It’s instant and favors the buyer, in the event that something isn’t right with the sample.

For the mass order, you’ve got options!

– Western Union: don’t. If a supplier only takes Western Union, don’t deal with them. No buyer protection; once the money’s gone it’s gone. Takes 3-5 days.

– PayPal: you can, but the fees on the receiving end are high, so most suppliers will be against it. You can offer to split the PayPal fees for order #1, and think of it as a sort of “insurance policy” on the first purchase. Instant.

– T/T Wire Transfer: the payment method of choice for most suppliers. It’s done from bank to bank, and is fairly reliable. But like Western Union, there’s no buyer protection. Takes 3-5 days.

– Alibaba Trade Assurance: Alibaba’s escrow service. All payments are based on an online contract. The money is sent to an Alibaba-owned account, and then transferred to the seller. Some buyer protection, and has the send reliability of a wire transfer. Takes 3-5 days.

Or, do a hybrid. Use PayPal or Alibaba Trade Assurance for your first order to get the protection, and then switch to wire transfers after a successful first batch.

**THE NEXT STEP**

There you go! Now you’re ready to source the perfect product for your Amazon business.

shopify,I built a website to help people find the best Shopify affiliate apps for their stores.,"Hi everyone. I started a Shopify affiliate app comparison website: [https://shopaffiliateapps.com](https://shopaffiliateapps.com)

I did a lot of research and testing this past year when looking for the right affiliate software to use on my own Shopify stores. And now I've published that research onto a website that breaks down and compares all the features and plans of each software. Basically I built something that I wished existed last year when I started my research.

I've reached out to every company listed to fact check my reviews and also provide me with any important info I might have missed. I'm really going the extra mile here to make this hands-down the best comparison site of Shopify-friendly affiliate software.

If you are currently using an affiliate software with your Shopify store, can you leave a comment on the site about your experience with whichever software you use? 

Reviews/opinions/feedback other than mine own will be very valuable to me and the 300k other Shopify store owners who may be looking for an affiliate management app.

So far the apps listed include:

-Omnistar

-LeadDyno

-Refersion

-Tapfiliate

-Affiliatly

-Enlistly

-Post Affiliate Pro

-Gold Merchant

-Linkhere

-Wigify

The site is brand new and I'm going to be adding a lot of content to it in the next few weeks. I spaced some of the blog posts out and scheduled them to publish (rather than publish them all at once) so that the site continues to be updated with fresh content, which is good for Google. I'm also going to add screenshots and video screencasts of the backend of each software. That's something in particular I would've loved to have seen without having to install each software to test it.

If you have any ideas or suggestions of things that'd be valuable to add to the site, let me know. It's a new project and I'm open to suggestion.

Thank you

PAUL

woocommerce,Shipping - Framed and Unframed Prints,"I have a website i am building that has a tricky shipping issue and i just can't work it out. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here is a run down....

They sell prints:

Print Sizes:
300x300mm Square 
A2 Rectangle
500x500mm Square
A1 Rectangle
A0 Rectangle

4 Options
No Frame - needs to be calculated by Australia Post Rates which i have added plugin for
White - Needs to only be available for Melbourne Metro only with free delievry
Black - Needs to only be available for Melbourne Metro only with free delievry
Tassie Oak - Needs to only be available for Melbourne Metro only with free delievry

Pricing of Shipping
- To be calculated with Australia Post Plugin for non-framed prints
- Free Shipping for orders over $250 (this applied to No Frame Options - coz Frames printed have no shipping anyway)
- All Framed Prints are free delivery BUT only people in the Melbourne Metro Area can buy a framed print

Shipping Container Size and Weights if this helps:
- 300x300mm Square: 700x80x80mm tube - 800grams in weight
- A2 Rectangle: 700x80x80mm tube - 800grams in weight
- 500x500mm Square: 700x80x80mm tube - 800grams in weight
- A1 Rectangle: 900x100x100mm tube - 1200grams in weight
- A0 Rectangle: 900x100x100mm tube - 1200grams in weight

We have set up variable products for each photo type.
I have added the size and weights for each variable product.

I just can't work out how to do the shipping so it changes for the ones with frames. I need the only option to be Free Shipping for Melbourne Metro Only.

There maybe some other questions but let me know if this makes sense first and if anyone can help.

I have bought these plugins - but just dont know how to use them:

Many apps won't completely remove themselves even if you remove them in the app interface of shopify.

ecommerce,"Have been planning to use weebly, but recently questioning that choice. Starting up a brand, and plan to have my own site.","The payment options for Weebly got me thinking that it might be prohibitive. 

I have a brand that I am starting up. Fairly straight forward.  Just different items across the board with the brand/slogan on them (Clothing/lighters/glassware/bar supplies/head shops etc.)

I want to be able to have a site that I can manage, with my inventory/shipping software properly integrated. I want to make it scalable without it being too difficult to hand off responsibilities. 

I'm learning more about fulfillment services and I just don't know if that's the goal that I should be working towards. I've been reading here and there about the numerous types of Inventory management / shipping software and I'm just not sure where to go. I have everything in place besides my website, and the infrastructure to support it. 

Is a ecommerce host like Weebly/Shopify that much better than something I could do with a more narrow hosting site coupled with the right software suites?

I plan on running the operation out of my house until I can afford to move into a different location (and hopefully more space for inventory). 

It's not a complicated operation but I'll have my site, then I have a distributor who will be selling to other retailers/storefronts. 

I'm trying to make a smart decision and not be left with something that could bog me down once I get going, then see if I'll hire full time people, or just defer to a fulfillment service. 

I just don't want to get stuck paying too much for a series of services in a bundle, that if I have the right software myself, I can do better, or cheaper, in the long term. Going through a learning curve is no issue, I've just been getting into this retail brand from another industry. I'm willing to learn what I need.

ecommerce,2.5k visits since opening and only 2 orders - what am I doing wrong? (more detail inside),"Hi guys,

My store selling [Scandinavian homewares](https://www.hoo-gah.co.uk) has been open for about 5 weeks, and in that time I've seen a reasonable amount of traffic but I've only made two (albeit high value) sales.

I've tried to increase brand awareness and traffic to the store by running competitions (very good for engagement but made no sales from it yet), advertising with facebook, pinterest and google, writing blogposts and commenting on the relevant blogs run by other people.

I realize there's a lot of healthy competition in my market, and have tried to make my brand unique by tying it into a Danish concept called hygge. Hygge essentially translates to living well, indulging in the little pleasures life has to offer, and making time for yourself. The concept has seen a lot of press coverage in the UK recently, I think as a bit of a pushback against the stresses of modern life. These are all things I've tried to capitalize on in my blog posts and tone of voice.

I guess the first thing I'm wondering is - is this low conversion rate to be expected for a new store? I read that a target conversion rate for stores is 2-3% and I'm currently sitting at 0.01%. I imagine this would improve slightly once I've honed my AdWords campaigns a little, but not enough to bridge the missing 2%.

I was wondering if anyone who has some insight into the early stages of setting up an online store has any advice. There are many things I'm aware I can do to make the store more profitable, but I'm finding it hard to figure out which will give the biggest ROI on my time and prioritize accordingly.

ecommerce,Need help setting up a peer2peer marketplace!,"Hello! New to the sub, you will be able to tell, believe me. 

So, as the title says, I want to set up a **marketplace**, where people would be able to sell their own stuff, much like multi-vendor only instead of vendors it would be individual users. As much as it sounds similar to a multi-tenant ecommerce, it's not that. I don't need any shop or a shopping cart, what I need is a site, where **registred members can input/add their own items.**

Is it standard practice for invoices for wholesale orders to be paid online via CC or PayPal?  I ask because I requested a check to avoid the large fee (will be about $300) and the merchant balked.  As this was my first large transaction, I didn't factor this additional fee into my pricing.  

Is this standard practice?  How do others manage B2B payments?  Do you have a cash/check price and then a CC price?

ecommerce,Bundling like variants in Woo,"Hello world, sorry for the vague title, but I couldn't think of how best to phrase this query that I've been tasked with. 

Short backstory, I've been helping my sister build out her Web store for her small town independent  kitchen/bed/bath this year, so far listing simple products like cookware, knives and appliances. She'd been trying to find the right combination to make real time inventory management work between the point of sale in store and the woo commerce website and finally got the missing link last year, and after some hiccups it's been working pretty well.  

The idea is to not only be selling our physical stock online (mostly for in store pickup, perhaps from out of town shoppers buying something for their relatives living in town) but also pre-orders for when we put in our orders with our suppliers in order to take advantage of better rates on (ie free) freight, since the previous owner would simply mark up for freight at 20% and order more frequently. 

**Now the current conundrum:** we want to encourage cross-selling of matching variants with the bedding pieces we're going to be listing.  The trouble we're running into is that be default, you can only cross sell to the main product family, not to a specific variant.

We'd like to be able to show off the matching pieces available for a selected colour of sheet or pillow or throw, but all of those sheets and pillows and throws would have several available colours and thus it would be cumbersome for the customer to navigate the selection to put together a matching ensemble out of the pieces listed.

When we were redoing the internal tags of our product list this summer, one thing that I did was make use of the 10 attribute columns available for each product to store more meta data about the products, with each category getting its own attribute listing, bedding having type, line, and simplified colour. I figured that at some point the simplified colour could come in handy and wasn't too much extra work, and if there were a way to make use of that to sort the variants so that they would function as we'd like....

Anyways, my sister is the one who's been working hard to build the foundation of the website and I've been more involved in filling in the parts.  I couldn't find anything specific to do what she wanted, but the closest I could find was one that gave you an order sheet so that you could fill in the quantities you would like to order of each variant on the product family page, which might be capable of something useful if not elegant.

One idea I had would be to have a landing page for each simplified colour, so that each variant with that attribute would be on the same page together, allowing the customer to see what might match with their bedding or that pillow.  

The simplified colour data meanwhile can't really be imported into Woo as an attribute without it thinking that it's something for the customer to select, so it would be needed to be derived behind the scenes in some way.  Again, this idea of mine isn't elegant behind the scenes just as it isn't on the store front either.

Anyways, my sister is telling me not to wade through the muck of researching plug-ins when we don't really know what we're looking for, seeing as though she's the one who has been doing so for much longer than I and she can't figure it out either.  I just figured I would throw it out to this fine reddit subcommunity and see if any of you had come upon a similar situation in building up your storefronts.

ecommerce,Shopify - Wholesale + retail,"Have been running Shopify for my online commercial building material store for about 2 years. Currently, our pricing and marketing is geared towards retail customers, but we are seeing traction with larger accounts and find ourselves using WAY too many discount codes to win larger contracts.

I am working with 2 potential solutions in trial and am curious if we are missing any key insight or if there is a third option that has not been considered:

Reward Points - (SweetTooth, Loyalty Lion, etc)
Advantages - a points system will allow us to capture some repeat business from our retail customers that are more and more comfortable purchasing product/tools online. Ultimately, this can also be geared towards larger customers looking for pricebreaks on larger orders.

Cons-
Most of these solutions have a gimmicky feel to them, and don't really address the need of finding a seamless way to offer targeted discounting off the bat for specific customers

Customer Pricing - Bold Commerce
This app seems to address the problem but has limitations on how many customer groups can be created. I'll spare the details, but for those familiar with shopify, it has to do with the number of product variants being capped at 100. Because of this we would, realistically, only be able to offer 2 pricing groups - our standard pricing and a one-size-fits-all wholesale price. 

I am leaning towards the Customer Pricing application, bu have also considered setting up a second storefront entirely for our wholesale clients. 

Are there any other apps out there to consider for Shopify?

Is Shopify the best platform for what we are tryign to accomplish?

Any insights rewarded with goollldddddddd and good vibes.

ecommerce,Marketplace to connect individuals to sell their services,"Hi everyone,
I'm currently in a very very strong mood to bring my idea to life which aims to connect people (customers) with other people (service providers) about whatever they have to offer. Kind of an ""uber"" way for people with special hobbies to make a little money by providing their services, but in different areas than driving around. For example in digital art, photography, entertainment, deejaying and so on. You get the point, hopefully :)

Now what I'm aiming for is kind of an ""ad market"", but I'm not really sure about the common naming of such markets. People who want to sell their services come to the site, create an account and are able to publish a single ad in a topic area, including a small portfolio description, area, pictures and experience level. This will be free of charge for non-professionals. Customers can reach them by contacting them through a form below the ad, so that there is absolute discretion between customer and service provider. They then manage the service fee independantly from the website, so I will not get any commission on this.
However, if a professional service provider wants to join and place his/her ad, they have to pay a small yearly fee and are allowed to add their price ranges to the ad, including a link to their web presence (if available). The same is possible for non-professionals, but optional. So the main income will be through this yearly fee model, however I hope that people are using the paid ad to push their presence in the market. An additional income would be topic related ad placement and affiliates.

Now my questions:
- Is there a common way how to describe such market places?
- Is there some software which features these basics already?
Would be happy to get some feedback &lt;3",4,3,2016-09-21,ECOM,0.024771975353360176,0.939433753490448,0.035794299095869064

ecommerce,Advice on business structure,"Hey,

Looking for some advice on how I should structure my ecommerce business.

Currently I have three websites, all of these three websites contain the product name in the title.

ie: ""phonesuk.co.uk"" for example.

They're fairly niche products which are all electronics.

I want to get these three websites under one brand so I can start crossselling.

I have a brand name I am happy with to sell products under these websites.

However I'm worried about Seo damage and whether having specific domains for each product is helpful or not.

I've seen companies like laptopsdirect.com have multiple sites(as seen on their site) and it seems to work for them.

Currently I have three options:
1) Leave the websites as they are and not do cross selling or building one brand

2)Bring all the websites into one site and build a brand.

ecommerce,Looking for feedback prior to my hard launch,"I launched a blog back around last fall to give a platform to people who have gone on unconventional adventure sand trips.

I started selling baseball caps with my brand's logo on them in May. They're almost sold out, but the majority of the sales came from my network. I didn't do too much marketing aside from announcing it on my personal facebook, brand's instagram, and through word of mouth.

I have a new round of hats coming in this week and I'm getting nervous since I'm considering this the official launch and plan on vamping up marketing efforts (reaching out to bloggers, emailing those who have subscribed to the email list on the site, and fb ads are my three biggest plans).

I know that one possible contention may be the product photography, but I'll be using proper equipment and lighting this round, so I already know that is something I must improve on.

I'm hoping anyone will take me up and review my [site](http://mainlandtradingpost.com) so that I can make sure it is as clean as possible prior to releasing the new products.

Any help and advice is greatly appreciated! Also would love feedback on if you have any other recommendations for marketing besides what I listed. Thanks!",5,5,2016-09-23,ECOM,0.019235072657465935,0.9034565687179565,0.07730831950902939

ecommerce,Need some Inspiration and Examples for New Site with Complex Product,"So I posted a while back to get some ideas on platforms.  After testing, my own research, advice of /u/standover_man we will be sticking with our in house configuration software and using a checkout like paypal or stripe.  Our current internal/b2b configurator is geared towards someone who orders our product day in and out and knows the lingo and how it works.  It is not helpful for someone who may need a replacement part, or using it for an engineered product which is my b2c target market.

My question is; do any of you know some sites that sell a complicated product and help guide you through the process as you order with hints, calculators to figure out what you need, what the lingo means, and where you could find/describe dimensions.  We are a smaller company don't have resources to help with every question from each customer, but I would love to put the tools at the customers fingertips to guide them through and allow them figure it out where possible.  I would love to see some examples of the order flow, how they build it into their ordering process to make for a desirable user flow/interaction.

woocommerce,Custom Monthly Subscription Boxes Idea,"I was wondering if a custom solution I recently built would have use for others besides the client I built it for.

It's a Woocommerce solution that extends Woocommerce Memberships &amp; Subscriptions, and essentially creates a membership system where each individual membership (using Woocommerce Memberships), of which there can be several, corresponds to the number of products/items a user can select for their ""subscription box"", which is a recurring monthly subscription they will receive and get charged for every month, using Woocommerce Subscriptions.

Sooo for example, lets say there's a brewery with different beers that they sell online. With this solution, they'd be able to offer, say, 3 memberships: The Rookie, The Hopster, and The Connoisseur, where The Rookie corresponds to a 6 pack of beers, The Hopster would be a 12 pack, and The Connoisseur an 18 pack. 

The user signing up for a membership would go to a Membership Sign Up page and select the membership level they'd like, then they select the different beers they want for that month's subscription box, and then they checkout.

Woocommerce will register the Subscription and new Membership user, and charge them monthly for their subscription. They then get an email every 10 days reminding them that they can select different beers for the upcoming box to be shipped, with a link to change the beers for the next box. If the user does not make an update to their box, they will receive the same beers they received in their last box, or they can choose to have a randomly selected assortment of beers chosen for them.

ecommerce,A few questions/feedback desired...my new niche ecommerce site,"Hi guys,

This is the first time I've piped up in this subreddit so I was hoping to get just kind of a general gut-check from the community on my topic and business model (and I do have some specific questions which I'll highlight below!)

To give a brief run-down of what I'm about and what I hope to do:

**My topic/niche:** Needle arts designs and supplies, with a focus on cross stitch and embroidery.  My business name is Colour and Cotton - [http://www.colourandcotton.com](http://www.colourandcotton.com)

**Why I think I can offer something unique:** I'm an artist by training and a needle arts enthusiast and have been for years, and I've come to realize that there are a lot of ""cult"" products and designs around cross stitch/needlework that people swear by, but they aren't readily available from one source.  These typically aren't products that you can find in big box stores (like Michael's or Hobby Lobby here in the US) - generally, they need to be ordered online or purchased at a local needlework store, which can be few and far between depending on where you live.  My goal is to offer a curated collection of supplies so that my customers can purchase their favorite products from one source, save on shipping, and hopefully find some other unique things to fall in love with while they're shopping.  And in the future: I dye my own embroidery floss and needlepoint fabric, as well as design my own cross stitch patterns, so I'd like to throw my own handmade items into the product offering mix as well down the road.

**How I've defined and studied my audience:** I've been a part of the online needle arts community for years and I have a solid idea of who my customers would be.  I'm targeting women from mid-20s to mid-50s, in the US, UK and Canada, who are at an ""enthusiast"" level when it comes to cross stitch, embroidery, knitting, crochet, etc.  They value quality supplies and aren't buying kits from Michael's...they have multiple projects going at once and they're very active about sharing their progress, finished work and ""stashquisitions"" (how many people refer to purchasing new supplies for their stash :D).

Steps I've taken so far:

* I've LLCed and have established wholesale accounts with a few desired distributors
* I've established an Etsy shop and my own domain/Shopify
* I've invested $500 in an initial inventory purchase and ""launched"" on Etsy and Shopify on September 1

**What's happened since September 1:**

* I've had about 35 sales on Etsy, and nothing on my own ecommerce site (and am trying to get my head around a strategy for increasing traffic to my standalone site).
* My social media efforts have been hit or miss...about 1,000 instagram followers, 100 Facebook fans, an email list of about 300

**And now, some of the specific questions that are swirling around in my brain:**

* I initially wanted to test viability with Etsy and make my first dollar, but while I'm having some small success there, should I focus the majority of my efforts on my standalone site, since that's where I want to sell long-term?  Or is it viable to keep both Etsy and my standalone site as two separate venues indefinitely?  Etsy has built in traffic, but there are a lot of other elements which are out of your hands on that platform.
* Am I too scattered with my product offerings?  I think part of the appeal (I hope) is that I will have a diverse array of products, but I'm having a really hard time balancing getting traction and not spending a zillion dollars investing in inventory, with still offering the value of a good selection of products right off the bat.
* Am I confusing things too much with throwing in my own handmade products?  I love making them, I know what customers want, and the profit margins are considerably better.  But should I consider that line of product as a ""phase 2"" down the road, or just consider myself another vendor/designer within my shop?
* Any feedback specific to my Shopify website (domain linked above)

Any other comments or observations are welcome, too.  Thanks SO much in advance for taking the time to read and ponder. 

Angela

dropship,Dropship suppliers - do you have any general advice on what not to do/what to do? What would you do differently if you were starting again?,"In the niche that I'm in there is one supplier that dropships, and they only do my niche as a sideline to their main dropshipping lines. There are several wholesalers but they all explicitly say they don't do dropshipping. The minimum order for all of them is £50-£100 which isn't a lot but it's all in bulk so you end up with 5x 1kg bags of stuff which if one of those isn't selling isn't ideal.

Obviously there's a gap in the market for a dedicated dropshipping service. I've done a little bit of research and there's definitely profit to be made for the products I'm looking at. I gather the general cons are you need to hold a lot of inventory, huge initial investment, there's not much % profit in it, and it can be incredibly time consuming. For me the main pro is that I don't need to write the marketing blurb for it. I can write facts - size, where it's made etc but as soon as I have to waffle around that I'm awful.

So anyways - my question is what are the pros/cons and do you have any advice/opinions on it?

I went through several platforms (Squarespace, Shopify) before I wound up with Wordpress + WooCommerce. The difficulty in setting up a site like this stems from the complexity of our products. Unlike products with standard sizes (small, medium, large), stickers can come in an infinite variety of sizes, so our site needed the ability to calculate pricing on the fly. Furthermore - pricing needs to interact with total square footage, which is determined by the quantities. We need the ability to charge less per part on 10,000 5"" x 5"" stickers than we'd charge for a hundred of them.


I felt like the hosted solutions purposely walled-off all the behind-the-scenes code that I needed to tinker with in order to create a pricing calculator. If I was more knowledgeable, I could probably get around this by developing my own custom plugin. The plugins that other people have made only get halfway there - with pricing based on area, but not based on area * quantity.

Anyway, Wordpress hosted on a VPS allows me to do whatever I want. So we went with that.

But I'll tell you, installing wordpress, updating php through the console, buying every nitpicky woo-commerce plugin, setting up site security and backups ... Jesus. This isn't for the faint of heart.",19,16,2016-09-27,ECOM,0.04209720343351364,0.9266160726547241,0.03128670156002045

ecommerce,Too much inventory to hand-input - other options?,"I run a successful Shopify with a physical product that has several variations and styles. Right now I house about 3,000 pieces of inventory, each style with anywhere from 1 to 100 pieces.

In the past, I have pulled boxes, hand-counted, and hand-entered this inventory every month. Inventory gets messed up by returns, exchanges, damaged items, etc and sometimes pieces get missed or not inputted right and suddenly I have a sale for an item I don't have, so... monthly inventory has been the fix.

The problem is, counting all these takes hours now.

Ideally I'd love a barcode system where I could scan the tub, input the inventory, have it automatically update in Shopify, and go on to the next item. However I'm not finding that, or at least not without a hundreds-per-month price tag. Shopify's app would be great, IF it had the barcode reading/searching capability...

shopify,My personal gripes about Shopify &amp; how they could improve the platform.,"Let me start off by saying I think Shopify is a great platform in many ways, it’s network infrastructure, interface and template engine are decent to work with, and although they don’t give you full freedom to run your own code on their servers or customize the checkout (Plus members excluded) this limitation does come with it’s benefits for the masses of customers that use their services. Stability, performance and a familiar experience for customers just to name a few.

And let's face it, there is no easier way for someone to get an online storefront up and running and be confident their customers can purchase, and pay for products without rigorously testing their site over and over again. Shopify has removed a lot of the initial work and headaches of setting up an online store, which is a great thing.

But after using Shopify as our Online store and face-to-face POS platform for the last 7 months, and having processed over 2000 orders, I’ve got a few gripes that I feel Shopify is really dropping the ball on. Some of them small, some of them obviously much bigger issues for them to tackle as a company and platform.

**POS User Management &amp; Mobile App Fragmentation**
*Note: This was written before the new app was launched but sadly not much here changes, if anything*

Anyone who has employees and uses the POS Applications will get this issue right away. The user management system in place to decide who can see what, and what permissions each user has is terrible. With a few highlights of it being spectacularly bad. 

Say you have employees out working in a farmers market selling your hot new product, awesome you have shopify POS this should be easy! Well in order for that TEMP agency cashier you hired for just this weekend, they are going to need a full admin account with access to all your reports, payment details, customer data, and be able to edit anything on your store in order for them to be able to sign in to the Mobile POS app on Android or iOS. 

Unless you have an iPad that is, then it’s fine, and you can create a POS only account and all is well. But, you cannot create these POS only accounts online, on your iPhone, Android or any other device EXCEPT for the iPad. Whoa, fragmentation at it’s worst.

POS taxes are also an interesting issue. On iOS devices you can use the GPS to determine the location and local tax rates, which works great with TaxJar (App &amp; Service) to pay the correct state, county and city taxes. With Android devices, you must create a POS Location in the Admin Back-end (Web Browser Only) and then select that location in the app to properly calculate taxes. It’s a nightmare especially with traveling salespeople like our business requires.

The older version of the Shopify app was the only remaining way to send a receipt again, or to another email address. That feature has since vanished in the latest update. If you want to re-send the customer a receipt, good luck. Write one down on paper, scan it, and email or mail it to them.

**Managing Orders and Customers**

If you’ve taken customer service calls or handled order management from customer emails you’ll be all too familiar with some of the oddities Shopify has with its post-order management. Let's name off some of the things you really need to be able to do for standard customer service, but can’t do with shopify.

Things you CANNOT do:

* Edit / Add To / Remove items of an Order
* Edit or Add Customer to a POS order that has no customer
* Edit POS Location of Order
* Edit Sales Agent of Order

Things you CAN do:

* Edit Email on Order (ONLY if a customer is attached, otherwise no option)
* Edit Tracking Number
* Add Comment
* Refund Order

Then, you have fun little issues where orders like to go into limbo, where a customer may call in and cancel an order, you cancel it. But depending on if you marked it as Fulfilled before or after it may not be possible to correct this and it may end up in the “Unfulfilled Order” queue forever unless you delete the order entirely. *Note: some changes to this have been made, it’s still kinda janky but somewhat better*

This is a huge issue, and many have tried to solve it with jankly Apps that clone, edit and resubmits new orders but this is a terrible way of handling the problem and should be native platform features.

**Weird Hybrid Stripe Accounts and Partial Integration**

I’m a long time stripe customer, we’ve processed hundreds of thousands of dollars with Stripe and have a great relationship with them. But that means nothing to my shopify store as you’re required to use their account integration that is “Powered By Stripe” and comes with 30% of the features that make stripe the amazing payment processing platform that it is.

Normal stripe accounts allow you to create customer payment profiles, with stored and tokenized Credit Cards on file. It’s amazing! It’s highly secure and creates a fantastic experience for returning customers to come back and rapidly re-purchase products and services from you! But this is 100% missing from Shopify with no support or mention of the features anywhere. Customer accounts are basically useless except for saving and displaying their order history. That you can’t edit or manage as noted above.

**No Recurring Billing / Subscription Orders**

This really could go under #3 on this list, but it’s so big it deserves it’s own main title. 

I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but recurring and subscription businesses are extremely popular right now, and for good reason. There is a lot of business model cases that revolve around a customer purchasing a product, and either needing to replace it or have used it up over a certain period of time and need to order again. So many businesses fall under this category it’s insane Shopify is choosing to ignore it so far, and really makes me wonder who’s managing their development and goals timeline.

One of the reasons this is so absurd, is that the merchant processing company that powers Shopify Payments, (aka Stripe) natively supports this! Subscriptions and recurring billing have been a part of stripe since the beginning and work perfectly fine. Either via their interface or the API. There is no reason why this isn’t integrated from day one.

The only option you have right now as a Shopify store owner is to use a Third Party app, that takes your customer off of your secure Shopify Website, to some third party (let’s cross our fingers &amp; hope it’s secure) website, and have your customers enter their credit card information like some sort of dodgy back alleyway deal. The fact that Shopify are even allowing these apps in the App Store and not doing it themselves is just plain insanity and someone needs to be fired over it.

**Collections are categories, Not Collections, which we really need BTW**

Shopify likes to call their product Categories “Collections”, Why? Idk YOLO I guess. But it reminds me daily of the real problem at hand. The fact that actual product “Collections” are completely absent from the platform.

Being able to Bundle products, multiple Line items and their QTY’s as single cart items is very powerful, and a default feature in many online E-Commerce platforms. Shopify's solution? Use janky third party Apps that can’t really do what you want them to, but pretend too and charge you $14.95 a month for it. Oh and you better be using a default theme or integration is going to be a nightmare.

**Product MetaFields exist (kinda), but no good way to use them.**

Built right into the Shopify API, Product Meta Fields give you a vast array of options and possibilities to do great things with your single page templates, product loops and more. But good luck using them. They are hidden away in the depths of the API docs and the only reasonable way to access them is by using a Third Party App to go to their server and edit your product Meta Fields. Why is this not built right into the Product management UI? Who knows, the developers were lazy that day I guess.

**“Customers” Aka CRM Feature might as well not exist, it’s basically useless.**

When a platform adds a CRM like feature to their platform, it usually comes with a few basics. 

Contact Logs, File Attachments, Customer Notes (Not just 1 text-area, an actual log), Set status of customer if they need to be called back, sold on a product, etc. Manage their orders and contact information, Who referred them, who the sales agent was and so on.

Well shopify gives us a nice paginated list of all your customers. Not even numbered, just next page and previous page. Want to learn more about customer behavior, retention, total customer stats, location information or more? Well sometimes these cute little widgets pop-up on your dashboard but don’t ever close them or they are lost into the abyss. So that’s fun.

ecommerce,Shopify vs Woocommerce,"Hi there! 
I am working for a small British skincare brand and we are looking to jump ship from Magento to another online selling platform. We feel that Magento is old, difficult and just “not for us”.
Now, our website guy told us about Woo commerce and we have already been talking to sales people from Shopify. 
Now what is the difference between Woo Commerce and Shopify and what platform did you choose and why? 
The people from Shopify tried to enrol us in a $2000/month (I mean srsly?) contract. I talked in on my boss and now we are looking at the much cheaper packages (probs going to go for the £70 version).
Now, what will be important for us? Good integration with the logistic channels (we work with Walkers logistics ltd), a modern website and theme, a good integration of our blog, good SEO integration, and that almost all functionalities of our website could be transferred ( www.merumaya.com) We are already talking to people that are willing to transfer the website for a good price but are there difficulties or consequences doing this depending on the platform we use? It also has to be VERY VERY VERY (piss) easy as my boss has to be able to do it on her own when I’m not in the office.

My site is verry good looking and cannot be compared even by far with most of the dropshipping sites I've seen build by people on shopify on this subreddit.
I'm looking to get around $500 for it wich is almost nothing compared to what you get for this money and the time you have to invest/pay to build a ecommerce bussines. You won't get anywhere such a great price and you won't have to pay any other monthly fees like you have to do on Shopify.

- dropshipping bussines on a great niche ready for getting first sales.
- 1 year of hosting and domain privacy wich costed me $60.
- all the main social media acounts created, optimized and integrated on my shop (facebook,twitter,google+,instagram,pinterest)
- full list on my suppliers from aliexpress.
- my support 24/7 in case you are a new to wordpress and woocommerce and need help to understand how things works.

I still need to do a bit of work to get the site optimized for mobile but that easy to do so I won't have to work more than 1-2 hours on it.

Why I am selling it so cheap?

I've lost my job 3 months ago and I'm in desperatly need for money. I thought building this site won't be so time consumming
I don't have any money for advertising. ( I can give you some free tips on facebook ads and Instagram shootouts )
I might take in consideration to get a partner who is able to invest at least $2000 in advertising but who have a clue on how marketing on the internet works.

ecommerce,Choosing .org over .com,"I have found that it could potentially cost me 100k US to get the .com domain name that i want - whereas the same domain name except with .org is not taken.

Could i get opinions on what the best course of action would be here? I'm thinking of just going with .org as i feel that the strong domain name will help a lot.

woocommerce,Products categories don't show up unless I click Sort by Name?,"This is driving me nuts:

I have 2 categories: 'Supplies' and 'components'

* If I attempt to quick-edit a product the category list is empty.
 * If I do a full edit the category list is empty .
* After creating I go to Products&gt;Categories and the list is empty.

When i click 'Sort by name in the category listing the categories appear(!). if i refresh they stay visible. If i navigate away and then back to Products&gt;Categories they are missing again.

Additionally when I try to view the logs nothing is visible (a clue, maybe?).

Steps tried:

* Double checked that the DB login has full capabilities 
* Woocommerce &gt; Tools - Transients, expired transients, reset cap, cleared sessions 
* Full uninstall and reinstall, with and without 'Remove All Data' selected 
* Reset permalinks 
* Double checked htaccess 
* Can't check logs --they don't appear in Logs viewer

shopify,Import Product CSV - Time-consuming?,"How long did it take you to import your initial set of products using the product CSV upload? Did you experience errors during the process? Hate Excel?

I built a small application yesterday to convert any CSV to an error-free Shopify CSV for import but I'm not sure it'll be a help to anyone.

I'm not trying to sell you anything, just looking for feedback if you'd use a tool like this.

shopify,Need some advice. Gut feeling says scam.,"Hi all, 

So I am currently in the process of setting up my UK based shopify store. It's an ongoing work-in-progress but looks fairly presentable so I went live with the site last night. 

I haven't done any kind of marketing yet, but somehow I have just received an order of over £500 (2 items) from Indonesia, shopify tells me they came to my shop via google. Payment has been received and Shopify's risk rating has classified it as low risk. 

I've checked on google maps and the delivery address does not look like the kind of location that would place a £540 order so I'm not sure how to proceed. I don't want to cancel a genuine order, but to be scammed on my very first order would be pretty disheartening. 

Any advice on how to proceed? 

Thanks",21,2,2016-09-30,ECOM,0.01819601282477379,0.9168128371238708,0.06499121338129044
woocommerce,An Effective Way to Market ECommerce,"We just started https://www.likewave.io - a job board for influencers. It allows brands to post discount / giveway opportunities to influencers who then re-post on their account to their thousands+ followers.
The idea is that brands who post will have access to influencers they never knew they had.
