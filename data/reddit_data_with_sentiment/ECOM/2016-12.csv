From that traffic I've had a conversion rate of 0.43%.  At that rate, my advertising ROI is negative, so I'm feeling like there's either something about my site that is discouraging sales, or just not a good product-market fit.

woocommerce,"New to woocommerce, looking for a few protips.","TL;DR: I am technically competent, but new to wordpress/woocommerce. Looking for recommendations on plugins/configuration.
---
Hi thank you in advance for taking the time to read, and if you choose, make recommendations.

I'm starting an apothecary site for an organic bug repellent I made with my 7yo son. It was meant to only be a fun project when the Zika scare started, intended to alleviate concern, and intro him to units/measuring/mixing/safety/etc. Evidently we created something awesome. So after my partners just shut me out of the business and stole my technology over thanksgiving, I'm looking to do something new, but I've never worked with WP/WooCommerce. I bought a template from templatemonster.com, (I didn't see anything at themeforest.net related to apothecary).

I bought the WP ALL import plugin and the woocommerece add-on. 
Here's what I'd like to accomplish and if I'm choosing a crappy plugin or there's a better way, please advise =)

1. Can customers register an account and not be a WP user? Do WC handle this? 

2. I signed up for feeds for some drop shippers so I can sell-through some aggregated products. I'm able to import, but how do I satisfy orders? Do you export in bulk for the drop shipper? I'm using wholesale2b.com. Is this what the woocommerce simply order export plugin does? Also just for testing I set the shipping rate to flat rate. There's got to be a better way to do this. I can estimate shipping from here for my product I'm sure (and if you could recommend a plugin...thanks!), but I don't know where the dropshipper is shipping from and I have no idea how to utilize their suggested shipping prices because it seems arbitrary without an explicit origination and destination point. 

3. how do I feature a product? I would obviously like to feature my own and backfill the rest.

4. I see a mailchimp plugin by mailchimp with a 2.5 star rating and another one with 4.9 but it's not obvious to me who the developer is. Is mailchimp the way to go and what is the recommend plugin?

5. I install WP Super Cache. any gotchas here I should worry about?

6. about to install contact form 7 - any thoughts?

7. is yoast SEO worth it?

8. I tried to use woocommerce lightbox plugin but the button floated over the add to cart button. How do I fix that?

9. woocommerce wholesale prices - I'd like to offer wholesale pricing for bulk units to stores. Is this the best plugin?

10. abandoned cart plugin - this seem pretty neat. any thoughts?

11. CMB2/kirki toolkit/WC short codes/YITH plugins were recommended but I don't understand why they're awesome.  

12. what plugins would you recommend?

I'm planning on supplementing with ebay/amazon/etsy, any places I should worry about? Is there a way to capitalize on the previously mentioned platforms and centralize inventory management and orders? Can this be done with API calls/hooks of some sort?

I really appreciate you taking the time.  I apologize for any typos or silly question from inexperience. Thank you again if you made it this far. Have an excellent day!

1- They have a limited time to buy this watch. 
2- Make the watch look neat.
3- Giving personality to the watches color. ( White = Pure White, Black = Dark Black, Pink = Sweet Pink, Beige = Calm Beige)

ecommerce,Wordpress + WooCommerce or Shopify?,"Do I use Wordpress + WooCommerce or Shopify?


I want to start four drop shipping websites. Not all at once but with a gap of 30-45 days between each website. I've done my research and finalized the niches.


I was looking at the costs and although Wordpress +  WooCommerce looks like a low cost alternative the costs are adding up:

Theme Cost - $50 to $100

Stripe and Paypal payment gateways - $80

Table rate Shipping plugin - $200

WooCommerce Abandon Cart plugin - $120

Some other plugins - $100


Cost of setting up a Wordpress + WooCommerce website is coming upto almost $700 when I include domain and hosting. Although they are all one time payments and in the long run the costs will average to be much cheaper than Shopify($79/month), I'm getting cold feet when I look at the high upfront cost.


Questions

1. Do I setup the store first on Shopify for $79/month and then shift to Wordpress later on?

2. Is it easy to shift the website? There will be a 200-300 products on the website.

3. Are there any additional costs on Shopify such as paid plugins or themes which are essential?

4. Any other suggestions you have for me?


I'm running a tight ship at the moment and would prefer to spend money on promotion rather than big ticket website infrastructure.

It is a Box-Subscription Food store, so every ""box"" I sell is paid once at checkout, and then re-charged at the end of 30 days and a new ""box"" is shipped to the customer.
I was looking at the fees for Subscription Billing Apps that sellers can add to their Shopify store since Shopify doesn't have a native Subscription service built-in, and the fees look ridiculously high.
Here's what I calculated using the ReCharge billing app as an example: $29/month Shopify plan will charge 2.9% for every transaction + the ReCharge App's Monthly bill which is $19.99 + the ReCharge App's transaction Fee of 1% per transaction + Stripe's payment processing fee of 2.9% per transaction.
That is INSANE if accurate. What am I missing here? Is there a cheaper way? I know Stripe themselves offer Subscription Billing, would that be better to add to my Shopify store instead of the ReCharge app?

I was wondering if there was anything obvious I could do to improve the website to increase conversions and maybe ideas aside from PPC to generate buzz and drive traffic to my site. 

Some things I am already plan on fixing:
1. more homepage slider photos
2. more detailed product descriptions
3. a new logo

I'll be starting a magazine soon solely for ecommerce. From Amazon FBA to Shopify to Teespring.

I've found that people don't always go online specifically to look for new music, especially independent music.  I thought perhaps if offered an inexpensive option to check out new music they might try it.  So as the customer is checking out from buying whatever they were buying from the merchant, they are then offered the option to receive, say three songs for an extra $1 to their order like a grab bag.  The merchant makes a little extra and the artists potentially earn new fans.

ecommerce,Free shipping experiment,"Like everyone, we have our fair share of abandonments. I’m not sure if it was my imagination or what, but it just seemed like they were happening more frequently lately. They might not be… I haven’t gone back and done any serious comparisons. But looking day to day, it just seemed like it was happening an awful lot. Maybe because it has been a bit slow, and you tend to stress out over stuff like that when it’s slow. At any rate… I’ve always known that everyone gets them, and it’s just a part of how this works. But it still bugged me. I started wondering… Why do so many people do this? We don’t have any of the typical things that are always listed as potential reasons for abandonments. We have a simple enough payment system. No registration. You can easily enter products and see your full total right on the first page. The only thing I could think of was… Shipping.

We *do* charge for shipping. Not because I want to, but we just have to. Most of our products go into the dimensional weight category and are very expensive to ship. I never felt like it was an issue before, because nobody ever seemed to have a problem with it, and I’ve never found any competitors in this niche that offer free shipping either. You would be crazy to do that, because you’d lose your ass. We have a small niche that is both consumer and commercial, and I manufacture about 2/3 of our products. So it’s not like people can just go to 10 other places to get our stuff.

But just for the hell of it, I decided to do an experiment... For two days, I just turned off shipping. I didn’t announce anything on the site anywhere. There was no code you had to put in or anything like that. The only difference was that… If you put something into your cart and went to the cart page to see your total… There would be no shipping charged. So basically... The price clearly shown on the product’s page, is the same price in the cart. No difference. No catches.

So the results after two days? We had pretty much a normal amount of sales, and still had pretty much the same number of abandonments. My conclusion? A lot of people are just freakn’ weird, and like putting stuff in a cart, even though they have no intention of buying it.",7,7,2016-12-11,ECOM,0.047994039952754974,0.9226387739181519,0.02936720848083496
ecommerce,Best online store option for small non-profit's gift shop?,"I'm a volunteer project manager for a non-profit wolf sactuary. I'm interested in finding an e-commerce solution for our gift shop.

The feature I'm most disappointed that SquareUp and PayPal do not currently offer is the option to enter an alternative ""Gift"" recipients name and address. Another being that SquareUp only offers an option to charge ""Flat Rate"" or ""Free"" shipping. Ideally we would be able to charge for shipping calculated by weight of an individual item or total order.

ecommerce,I need to accomplish a unique shopping cart goal,"This has been a thorn in my side for a while. I'm not ruling out any platforms / CMS / shopping carts at this point since I cant seem to find a clear solution anywhere. I want at the very least to find one feasible solution.

I'm trying to find a way to create a buyback shopping cart for a buyback site so I can purchase books from students as part of my business. This is the reverse of platforms now with items sold to consumers, but instead I'll be buying. The only related software I found on the market was a plugin for Magento oriented towards cellphone buyback sites: http://magento.ikantam.com/store/electronics-trade.html

Its the same principle but the process is eccentrically focused on phones with static prices (I'll be integrating a buyback algorithm) so that $250 would be more wisely spent elsewhere to create a custom solution for my own buyback process with books. 

Here are sites implementing buyback carts:

https://www.webuybooks.co.uk/

http://www.textbookrush.com/sell/textbooks/

https://www.secondbind.com/

ecommerce,Please Avoid ScalablePress,"ScalablePress is a shitty printing company. Please, avoid them. 

We have a 20% mistake rate with them. Look at the last T-shirt they shipped to one of our customer:

You can see that they put a ticket for ""White Next Level Fitted Crew"" T-shirt, and sent a grey motherfucking V-Neck. Look at how much the design printing is awful too. It's not even centered.

I also had to command 3 times the same T-shirt because the design had print mistake on it. At the time I'm writing, 10 days later, the T-shirt is still not printed.

Clearly guys, avoid ScalablePress. They have a poor quality control and a terrible customer service. They ignore you.

So everyone upvote this and make them seen for how they truly are.

ecommerce,[REQUEST] Single Product Sales Pages,"**I need to be enlightened.**

I have a bunch of ideas in unrelated markets and want to test each product idea cheaply but give each one enough time to generate some interest.  My uneducated gut is telling me to create a little real estate on the internet that captures some of the customers and test out ideas on the cheap.  So...

I am looking for a company who fully hosts a low cost way to generate a single product sales page and see only the one product, scroll down and enter all shipping and CC information and click the ""BUY"" button.  Is this an impossible task?

No other features wanted.  
* I'm not looking to create landing pages and drive customers through funnels.
* I'm also not looking to pay $29/month PER PRODUCT so I can have each idea sitting on Shopify.  
* I also do not want to dick around on Wordpress/WooCommerce and/or get into hosting (although I may be open to it if the process is simple enough/not time consuming).  

I do have my own domain names though.

woocommerce,How to show variation attributes on category listing pages,"I created a woocommerce shop with all variable products. Each product had ""colour"" and ""size"" attributes with various variations of each. I had requirements to display the products on the category listing pages with all the colour variations so the user could scroll through each colour and click the one they would want more information about. Obviously there's some specific code here for my project's requirements, but it's fairly straight forward and could be adjusted to your needs. The following explanation assumes you have an attribute for ""colour"" and ""size"" for your products.

The end result looks something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/sRCEs). Here's how I did it.

Pre-requisites:

* [WooCommerce Variation Swatches and Photos](https://woocommerce.com/products/variation-swatches-and-photos/) wordpress plugin

* [Swiper](http://idangero.us/swiper/) JavaScript slider library

* [WooCommerce Direct Variation Link](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-direct-variation-link/) wordpress plugin

In your custom theme, override the `loop-start.php` template file (yourtheme/woocommerce/loop/loop-start.php):

    &lt;?php
    
    $output = array();
    $attribute = 'pa_colour';
    $all_colours = get_terms( $attribute, array('fields' =&gt; 'ids') );
    foreach($all_colours as $term_id) {
        $swatch_term = new WC_Swatch_Term( """", $term_id, $attribute, false, 'swatches_image_size' );
        $output[$swatch_term-&gt;term_slug] = array(
            'term_id' =&gt; $swatch_term-&gt;term_id,
            'type' =&gt; $swatch_term-&gt;type,
            'thumbnail_id' =&gt; $swatch_term-&gt;thumbnail_id,
            'thumbnail_src' =&gt; $swatch_term-&gt;thumbnail_src,
            'color' =&gt; $swatch_term-&gt;color,
            'size' =&gt; $swatch_term-&gt;size,
            'term_label' =&gt; $swatch_term-&gt;term_label
        );
    }
    ?&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""products"" data-swatches=""&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars( json_encode( $output ) ) ?&gt;""&gt;

Retrieve the available variations for each product in `content-product.php` (yourtheme/woocommerce/content-product.php)

`$available_variations` will be used later:

    &lt;?php

    if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
        exit; // Exit if accessed directly
    }
    
    global $product, $available_variations;
    
    // Ensure visibility
    if ( empty( $product ) || ! $product-&gt;is_visible() ) {
        return;
    }
    
    if ($product-&gt;is_type( 'variable' )) {
        $available_variations = $product-&gt;get_available_variations();
    }
    
    ?&gt;
    &lt;li &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt; data-id=""&lt;?php echo $product-&gt;id; ?&gt;"" &gt;
        &lt;?php
        /**

         *
         * @hooked woocommerce_template_loop_product_link_open - 10
         */
        do_action( 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop_item' );
    
        /**

        do_action( 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop_item_title' );

        do_action( 'woocommerce_shop_loop_item_title' );

        do_action( 'woocommerce_after_shop_loop_item_title' );
    
        /**

         * @hooked woocommerce_template_loop_product_link_close - 5
         * @hooked woocommerce_template_loop_add_to_cart - 10
         */
        do_action( 'woocommerce_after_shop_loop_item' );
        ?&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

Add the following to `functions.php` in your theme. This will enqueue the swiper js library and css as well as a custom main.js, which I'll talk about further below:

    add_action( 'init', 'yourtheme_child_theme_setup' );
    function yourtheme_child_theme_setup() {
    	add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'yourtheme_replace_scripts_child' );
    }
    
    // include custom scripts
    function yourtheme_replace_scripts_child()
    {
    	// swiper
    	wp_enqueue_script( 'swiper-js', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/assets/js/swiper.jquery.min.js', array( 'jquery' ), '3.4.0', true );
    	wp_enqueue_style( 'swiper-style', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/assets/css/swiper.min.css', array(), '3.4.0', 'all' );
        
		// your theme custom javascript
    	wp_enqueue_script( 'yourtheme-js', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/assets/js/main.js', array( 'jquery' ), '0.1', true );
    }
	
The woocommerce_get_product_thumbnail() function has custom logic to add an image for every unique colour variation. For example, I have a variation for each of the following:

* Colour: Blue, Size: 1

* Colour: Blue, Size: 2

* Colour: Red, Size: 1

* Colour: Red, Size: 2

* Colour: Green, Size: 1

* Colour: Green, Size: 2

The code in `woocommerce_get_product_thumbnail()` will get only the unique colours of all available variations and use the image from those variations. Each image is wrapped in a link that will link directly to the variation selected (relies on the WooCommerce Direct Variation Link plugin). The swiper javascript library will take care of the rest. This was a specific requirement for the project, but you can adjust the script to do what you need.

Add the following to `functions.php`. 

    // Override the stock woocommerce_get_product_thumbnail() function
    // This will add the image for every unique colour
    function woocommerce_get_product_thumbnail( $size = 'shop_catalog', $deprecated1 = 0, $deprecated2 = 0 ) {
        global $post, $product, $available_variations;
        
        if ( has_post_thumbnail() || empty($available_variations) ) {
            return get_the_post_thumbnail( $post-&gt;ID, $size );
        } elseif ( wc_placeholder_img_src() ) {
            if ($product ) {
                $var_img = array();
                $base_url = get_the_permalink();
                $w = 300;
                $h = 300;
                $output = """";
                foreach ($available_variations as $variation) {
                    $colour = $variation['attributes']['attribute_pa_colour'];
    
                    if (!isset($var_img[$colour])) { // only care about the first variation on a unique colour -- no duplicates
                        $var_img[$colour] = 1;
                        $size = $variation['attributes']['attribute_pa_size'];
                        $url = $base_url . '?colour=' . $colour . '&amp;size=' . $size;
                        if (isset($variation['attributes']['attribute_pa_hanger'])) {

                            $w,
                            $h,
                            $colour,
                            $url,

                echo '&lt;/div&gt;';
            }
            else {
                return wc_placeholder_img($size);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Add a wrapper for the swiper pagination bullets. This will be filled in by javascript
    add_action('woocommerce_after_shop_loop_item', 'yourtheme_product_listing_colour_swatches');
    function yourtheme_product_listing_colour_swatches() {
        global $product, $available_variations;
    
        $attribute = 'pa_colour';
        if ( $product &amp;&amp; taxonomy_exists( $attribute ) &amp;&amp; !empty( $available_variations ) &amp;&amp; false !== $available_variations ) {
            echo '&lt;div id=""paginate-' . $product-&gt;id . '"" class=""swiper-pagination""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';
        }
    }

The `main.js` file (referenced in the functions.php above) sets up the swiper component for each product in the list, so you can swipe through each variation on the listing page and click the variation you want:

    jQuery( document ).ready(function() {
        (function($) {
            var swatches = jQuery('ul.products').data('swatches');
            $('ul.products .swiper-container').each(function() {
                var swiperContainer = $(this);
                var productId = swiperContainer.parent().data('id');
                var productSwiper = new Swiper(swiperContainer, {
                    direction: 'horizontal',
                    loop: true,
                    noSwiping: true,
                    pagination: '#paginate-' + productId,
                    paginationClickable: true,
                    paginationBulletRender: function (swiperObj, index, className) {
                        var colour = jQuery(this.pagination).parent().find('.'+this.slideClass+'[data-swiper-slide-index=""'+index+'""]:not("".'+this.slideDuplicateClass+'"")').data('pa_colour');
                        var swatch = swatches[colour];
                        var output = '&lt;span class=""' + className + ' tooltipped tooltipped-s"" data-pa_colour=""'+colour+'"" style=""' + (swatch.type == 'color' ? 'background-color:'+swatch.color : '') + '"" alt=""'+swatch.term_label+'"" aria-label=""'+swatch.term_label+'""&gt;';
                        if ( swatch.type == 'photo' ) {
                            output += '&lt;img src=""'+swatch.thumbnail_src+'"" /&gt;'
                        }
                        output += '&lt;/span&gt;';
    
                        return output;

                    simulateTouch: false // setting this to true was causing problems in desktop browsers
                });
            });
        })(jQuery);

ecommerce,Ecommerce Accounting Issues,"At my business, we are having a troublesome time trying to find an efficient way of doing bank reconciliations due to our Ecommerce department. The problem the accountants are having is we are recording sales before they are captured by Authorize.net in some cases, because the product is backordered and the customer will not get it for sometimes 60 days.

Our parts manager does not feel good about holding the customers' money for that long if a part is backordered, and that is why we are recording the sale but not capturing payment in these cases. Then our accountants complain that the process of these reconciliations is way too time consuming and ridiculous because they have to figure out which transactions were actual sales, and reconcile any pending orders if we recorded a sale in August but didn't capture the payment until September.

I am trying to figure out how I can make everyone's life easier, or whether this is just a harsh reality of Ecommerce and our accountants need to deal with it. Should we be holding customers' money if a product is backordered, or should we wait to capture the payment when the order is fulfilled? Any info or resources would be great, thanks in advance!

I recently started www.wildroutdoor.com were an outdoor and sporting goods e-store hoping to tap into the outdoor recreational market. 

I'm looking for insight into the web design itself (if the store is functional and appealing or if it needs improvement?), product selection (more so any advice on were/how to find products consumers may want in the niche) (im going to do research on camping/outdoor reddits to see what products are most needed by the actual community) and finally any knowledge of marketing/advertising would be huge.

However now I'm trying to add the variation specific SKU and it won't let me because it needs to be unique. Turns out the variations are still in the database, just not attached to the products. 

I think my best bet is to edit the database table and remove all ""old"" variations (done in August vs December). But I don't know how to edit the database tables.

I got targeted by people in Indonesia and morocco, now the purchases that had no warnings on them are getting charged back. I stand to lose over $1500 in products shipped not including the $15 fee on every single transactions that gets charged back from shopify. 

As a father of 5 kids and living in an area where we lost over 150,000 jobs due to oil prices this side venture was supposed to help my family not plunge us into debt. I can't afford to take this loss.

Shopify's answer is that I should be questioning every order and requiring id and cc pictures for each purchase, what then is the point of having fraud detection? I have never been charged back like this with paypal because their fraud filters are a lot better. 

All I can say is be very careful about your transactions the charge backs come well after the purchase you stand to lose a lot of money....

I am considering shutting down the whole store and I was just starting to get some decent traffic and spent over a $2000 in ads for this shop not including the other loses.

As far as business ventures go this was a harsh lesson for me and my family and I post this so no one else makes the same mistake I did. People are out for themselves and fraud is at an all time high.

shopify,Sections are awesome,"This post is just me praising sections from the perspective of a developer. Warning, I'm writing this from my phone so...

I'm currently working in a very large code base for a client and it is a complete mess. Tons of theme settings, tags, and custom metafields that I have to dig through the code to figure out. A few days ago I decided to try to convert one of the sliders to use sections instead of theme settings.

A little back story in this slider. Recently, the client got tired of having to basically erase and re-upload images to change their order, so I implemented a select in theme settings to be able to pick the order of each image. This added a ton more lines to theme settings and the liquid logic was starting to get a bit more complicated.

Changing it to sections made things at least 10x better. For one thing, the client can now have an unlimited amount slides instead of the hard cap of 6 that we set in theme settings. Another amazing thing is that the images are being saved to files (image_picker) instead of assets. One amazing thing about this is it doesn't matter what the file name is. I just loop over the blocks and grab the current image from the settings in that block ( block.settings.image ).

The biggest thing for the client is how easy it is to reorder the slides. Literally just drag and drop to swap things around. This is exactly what the client was picturing in the first place. The other solution was very flimsy and prone to a human error. This solution is user proof. Especially with image_picker, even if the client accidentally removes an image, they can just open up the picker and grab the image from files instead of re-uploading.

A few developer friendly things this is doing for me are: removing lines from settings_schema.json (was up to 5000 lines a few days ago), makes logic much less complicated easier to read/understand, makes the code agnostic to file names/types (images specifically), scopes section variables to the section only, and keeps the logic and settings in one contained area.

I've actually converted a few more areas of the homepage into sections after this experience and with every new section I feel the code massively improving. There's a lot more work to do, but this is really improving the process and making things easier moving forward.",7,5,2016-12-17,ECOM,0.040345992892980576,0.9295217990875244,0.030132248997688293
ecommerce,Confused about Licensing and Taxes. Would love if someone could point me in the right direction.,"Have a good background in business, understanding product demand and competition, pretty much understand the framework of ecommerce although not completely familiar with all the tools available - but not impossible to learn by no means. 

However the thing that is killing me before I even get off the ground is thinking about the legal and taxes for ecommerce. Searching around only served to make me more overwhelmed and fearful I may not be in good shape to take this venture on, sort of like trying to self diagnose an illness online I wound up believing my cold symptoms may actually be a precursor to some uncurable disease. 

The only real experience I have had with any of this was going with my Uncle when I was.... 18 or so to get a DBA for a small photography partnership. I was not the lead in that situation and can only vaguely remember signing some documentation and formerly listing our name. 

Now looking at the sales tax laws, and licensing requirements for ecommerce I am quite confused. 

Not sure is sole proprietorship is the best thing - do people get sued for delivering a product that was damaged, or failing to complete a return deposit in a timely manner? I do not know. 
Maybe I go with an LLC, but then I have absolutely no idea how to go about that or what is required of me at that point. 

And that is not mentioning all the strange sales tax issues? I am completely lost as to how that works. I understand the idea of a nexus, but I do not understand how record keeping should work in that regard. How am I to know if I am selling to someone within in my state or overseas? Just at order time I suppose? Are there tools that handle the tax rates on orders fulfilled so I do not have to manually keep up with every purchase from every different area?
Where do I go to get a sales Tax Id do that I can contact suppliers and wholesalers?

Reside in College Station, Texas if that helps.

Not looking for someone to do all this for me, just maybe someone could describe what they did and the process they went about to get the legal and all set and well. I don't want to start up a rinky dinky shop and unknowingly be breaking tax laws, but I also do not think it should be necessary to hire an accountant to handle what I imagine will be a very small scale venture. To clarify the scope of what I am currently doing, my current goal is exactly this: Create and structure a website with Ecommerce ability and sell 10 Products through drop shipping. 
That is my only goal currently, if I can manage that, I will be a happy camper.

ecommerce,Feeling like everything is saturated &amp; there is no more room in the market for new players like me,"Hi /r/ecommerce 

I feel like every single product area I look at it saturated. It seems as if there is perfect competition in every market which means (in my mind) that there is no room for new players like me. One of the main problems is everyone always says you must make sure you are unique - I can't seem to get past this stage of developing/choosing a product that has a USP. It feels like everything has been done 100 times over. Does your product/business have to be unique? If that were the case, why are there 100s of people selling, for example, the same lighters on amazon?

I've always been interested in e-commerce (mainly from my liking of marketing and branding I picked up whilst helping to run a society at University). I feel like the only way I could possible succeed is essentially through selling similar products to the competition (let's say homewear for example) but marketing them better - this almost makes me feel like a fraud for not being able to sell a product that can stand on its own two feet without deploying a huge amount of marketing. 

I'd love to get insight from you guys regarding how you managed to choose your product, USP, target market and how you feel about competing against established competition who are often selling very similar products (take for example, the candle industry). 

Thank you all",12,12,2016-12-18,ECOM,0.015354805625975132,0.908107340335846,0.07653789967298508

ecommerce,Aliexpress Dropshipping,"I want to setup a shop using [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and [Oberlo](https://www.oberlo.com). I intend on selling clothes, bags, accessories etc. I am to be as big as [Boohoo](https://www.boohoo.com) or any shops like that.

I found a number of great suppliers that have great product images that matches the quality of images in other shops. My only issue however, is the shipping times. To ship to Ireland it takes 25 days and for my niche this is unacceptable. I'd be willing to pay for DHL shipping as that's much faster but I'd still want to make a decent profit. DHL is about 10-40$ so I could bear 5$ of the ten and maybe the customer can bear the rest + profit. 

The only problem is they charge for DHL individually so if a customer buys 3 dresses that's 30$ DHL and 15$ shipping on their end.

I thought of maybe using a 3PL in china that will package and group the customers orders and ship them with DHL there. My profit margin would be high to cover the average shipping cost. I'm not really targeting the US so ePacket doesn't really come into play here

I really want to setup an online store and as of now I have such little investment capital. Boohoo, RiverISland, Misguided etc. all offer 3-5 days or next day shipping so I don't see how 25 days could beat that.

I'm pretty much looking for a cheap enough way to get fast shipping for my customers - max 10 days. I won't mind including some % of the shipping cost in the item itself and then the customer can pay the rest and there be the free 25-day shipping option too.

ecommerce,"I messed up, BAD. Any experienced business owners that are good with customer service and complaints due to generally very poor service and late shipments? I really need help, my business is literally dying and I have to save it.","First I just want to say that I am aware that I screwed up and made some stupid mistakes that could have been avoided, so I really don't want/need to here any ""you shouldn't have done that"" or ""could have done that"" type stuff, it isn't going to help me solve this urgent problem I've gotten myself into. If you don't have positive advice then please just don't even post, I have been dealing with some serious personal problems and health/mental issues and am at a very low point in my life; it has greatly effected my business performance. I should probably also add that I have been in business for around 5-6 years but I am a smaller home-run business with no employees. Conversely, if anyone would like to contribute some positive advice for me in the future then I would gladly welcome it, but that isn't really the info/advice I am currently and desperately needing ATM.

I've really screwed up this Christmas, I have probably at least 50 complaints/inquiries right now and almost every single one of my order's have been late (many still not shipped), some up to 2-3 weeks delayed, and of course, now is obviously the worst possible time of the year for this to happen. I may actually lose money this Christmas this year as I am trying very hard to save my business' reputation to the point of giving some customer's their order completely free (by refunding them after they have been shipped late), some with expedited shipping, all paid by myself.

I make my products and haven't been able to stay caught up, but that isn't public knowledge to my customers, I try retain the image as a re-seller to my customers for most of my products and prefer it that way for my own reasons. Also, I sell embroidered patches as well as digital downloadable embroidery designs, however the patches are my main problem/concern.

**Main Question:
Is anyone willing to give me some advice and maybe help me out with creating a good custom template for apologies about the delay/lack of communication and not keeping my customers updated on their order status?**

I have some really pissed off customers (both on Etsy and eBay). I've usually been pretty good at turning around even the hardest to please/(understandably)upset customers because of long delays, but, I currently have such a large amount of messages and so much work that I do not have the time to type an explanation/apology personalized to every single one of my customers that have messaged me, so I really need a general 'copy and paste' template to inform my customers about their order's customized for my business and the mistakes I've made.**At this point I am mainly trying to avoid getting anymore bad feedback while avoiding as many refunds as I can. I've gone from %99 to %97 on eBay this year, dropped %1 just this month alone.**

Please if anyone is experienced with dealing with this type of situation I would be so grateful for your advice, I am really hoping to find a professional apology template that says that I take full responsibility for the poor service they have received and that I truly hope to make it up to them. One option for trying to make it up to my customers that I do sometimes (and works pretty well for most customers and usually saves me from bad feedback) is to offer shipping an extra patch free of charge so they either end up getting double what they paid for or get an extra different patch for free. This actually saves me money but probably won't work for a lot of my current orders since they need it delivered in time for Christmas and I'm not going to be able to do it for many orders, so I will probably have to just cancel a lot of my most recent orders. If anyone has any alternative ways that I could possibly turn my upset customers around and leave them satisfied then I'd love to hear any ideas.

I am desperately in need of help and I really appreciate any advice offered.

ecommerce,Will a Facebook ad open me up to copyright complaints if my item is borderline?,"So, I'm selling one of those t-shirts that's a list of names like the ""Ross &amp; Rachel &amp; Pheobe..."" shirt. It's obviously unlicensed, but as I understand it, two things allow sellers to make merch like this:

1) Plausible deniability (wink wink) that the product is copyright infringement.

2) Keeping a relatively low profile about it.

I want to buy a small ($1 a day) Facebook ad to put my t-shirt in front of a couple hundred fans of this franchise. My question is this: **is a Facebook ad high profile enough that the lawyers would be willing to take the time to draft up a cease and desist?**

ecommerce,30 E-commerce Email Marketing Messages That Boost Sales,"Recently helped put together an huge article on 30 different types of email marketing messages. It’s e-commerce focused but relevant to other industries, especially SaaS. The idea is that we all know how powerful of a sales channel email marketing is, and there are a lot of ways you can leverage it that you may not have thought of.
 
The article includes examples of each type of email, a bunch of stats, best practices, and links to in-depth guides to each type of email. We also quoted a bunch of sources for the ‘Why It’s Important’ section, which would have taken forever to include in this post. Below is the TL;DR of each section.
 
**1. Welcome Email**
 
*Why It’s Important*

Welcome emails result in in ““4x higher open rates and 5x higher click rates compared to other promotional emails. Keeping in mind that in e-commerce, average revenue per promotional email is $0.02, welcome emails on average result in 9x higher revenue — $0.18. And if it’s optimized effectively, revenue can be as high as $3.36 per email.”

*How to Do It*

* Keep your subject line conversational. Welcome messages should read as if they’re coming from a friend, not from a nameless, faceless marketing entity.

* Use your welcome message to let readers know what they can expect from you, as well as how they’ll benefit from staying subscribed.

* Include a CTA. Take this initial interaction opportunity to get subscribers to engage with you on a deeper level – even if your target action is something as simple as following your brand’s social channels

**2. New Product Teaser**

*Why It’s Important*

By creating an alluring and irresistible email campaign that teases and builds up anticipation for your project, you can create a great amount of support and succeed in your project goals.

*How to Do It*

* Create a story for your product. Whether you use a single teaser message or a series, build a story that draws readers in and gets them excited about your upcoming launch.

* Set a goal for your teaser. Are you aiming to capture new registrations? New leads? New pre-order sales? Figure out what you hope to achieve with your campaign, as well as how many of these individual conversions you expect.

* Be mysterious. Give just enough away to pique readers’ interest and get them to take action (slightly more if you’ll be asking them to actually pre-order).

**3. Product Launch Email**

*Why It’s Important*

The Direct Marketing Association reports that “66 percent of consumers have made a purchase as a result of an email, which beat out social and direct mail.”

*How to Do It*

* Stay focused. This isn’t the time to promote a future sale or give a company update. Keep your customers focused on the goal of product sales.

* Include an exclusive promo offer. People like to feel special, and nothing makes subscribers feel more like they’re part of the “in crowd” than a unique offer that’s only available to them.

* Make your new product’s benefits clear. Ideally, you’ve done enough market testing to know what it is about your offering that appeals most to your customers. Now’s the time to put that data to work by composing a message that emphasizes the value buyers will gain.

**4. Cart Abandonment Email**

*Why It’s Important*

According to Business Insider, “Initial emails, sent three hours after a consumer abandons a cart, average a 40% open rate and a 20% click-through rate.”

How to Do It:

* Most e-commerce carts have automated abandonment emails built in, though you may need to a) turn yours on, and b) customize the look and feel of the message to match your branding.

* Be sensitive about the timing and frequency of these messages. Customers abandon carts for all different reasons, and they may or may not welcome automated emails encouraging them to return and shop. Test the number of emails you send and your reminder intervals for best results.

**5. Partnership Promotions**

*Why It’s Important*

On the MarketingSherpa blog, Adam Sutton shares that Delta Faucet was able to extend the reach of its email marketing campaigns by 30% through partnership promotions.

*How to Do It*

* Choose partners that don’t directly compete with your brand, but that still target the same demographics (as in the case of Birchbox and Rent the Runway).

* Offer to handle the creative development yourself. You’ll find prospective partners are more receptive to your proposed promotions if you volunteer to create the message, set the timing, and send it from your account.

**6. Customer Feedback**

*Why It’s Important*

“Successfully utilizing customer feedback is a must for any business looking to provide users with the products they need. Feedback guides and informs your decision-making and influences your product roadmap. It’s also essential for measuring customer satisfaction among your current customers. Getting a handle on how customers view your product, support, and company is invaluable.”

*How to Do It*

* Use tools like SurveyMonkey or Qualaroo to administer your surveys.

* Keep surveys relatively short. Few people will sit patiently in order to wade through a 30+ question quiz.

* Remember the limitations of customer surveys. Customers may not know how they’d really respond to hypothetical prompts (such as, “How much would you pay for a product with [xx] feature?”), while relying too closely on survey data prevents you from understanding the nuance behind customer responses. Pair survey data with in-person feedback gathering, if possible.

**7. Digest/Content Roundup**

*Why It’s Important*

The Skimm founders Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg used the content roundup format to build an email list of 3.5+ million subscribers that boasts a 40% open rate, all since 2012.

*How to Do It*

* Identify the authoritative blogs and websites within your industry, and then add them to an RSS reader.

* Periodically, review the new content that’s been published and select the best pieces to include in your content roundup.

* Make it a value-add for your subscribers. Anyone can compile a list of articles; why should your subscribers take the time to peruse yours? Weisberg sums this up with the basic thesis behind The Skimm: “Let’s make it easier to be smarter. That’s really what Skimm does – it makes it easier to be smarter in a way that already fits in with your daily routine.”

**8. Content Announcement**

*Why It’s Important*

“72% of B2B buyers are most likely to share useful content via email,” according to Earnest Agency. Kick off this sharing by seeding your email marketing messages with your latest high-quality content pieces.

*How to Do It*

* Make sure any content you promote this way stands on its own as a valuable resource for your audience. Your subscribers won’t be impressed by your middle-of-the-road efforts – and they certainly won’t share them.

* It’s okay to promote individual content pieces multiple times via email. Not all of your subscribers open every message; mentioning your best content in several messages maximizes the chance that they’ll see it

**9. High-Value Content**

*Why It’s Important*

Your email messages don’t always have to feature promotions or pitch CTAs intended to drive reader actions. Sometimes, it’s best to simply send helpful educational content that your subscribers will find valuable – as Mailchimp did in this sample message.

*How to Do It*

Think about what your subscribers need to know, and then send content that answers their questions. The more information you can provide, the more they’ll come to rely on your company as a source of expert information.

**10. Social Notification**

*Why It’s Important*

“Email subscribers are 3 times more likely to share your content via social media than visitors from other sources,” per the QuickSprout blog.

*How to Do It*

* Be on the networks your customers are most active on. This goes for all marketing, really, but you’ll waste time trying to get email subscribers to share your content on networks they aren’t invested in.

* Target your most socially-shareable content. It’s unlikely that all of your content pieces will be well-suited to social promotion. For maximum effect, deploy this type of message only when you have something your social audience is sure to love.

**11. Come Back Emails**

*Why It’s Important:*

Research shared by Kevan Lee on the Buffer blog suggests that “the average inactivity for a list is 63 percent, meaning that once someone joins they are less likely to ever follow-up with your follow-up emails. What’s to become of that inactive 63 percent? Re-engagement campaigns are an excellent place to start.”

*How to Do It*

* Be noticeable. Lee shares the subject line “This Is Not An Email From 2006” from a Digg re-engagement campaign as an example that caught his attention.

* Be clear, but not needy. Let inactive subscribers know what they’re going to miss out on if they’re booted from your list, but don’t be so needy that they head immediately for the “Unsubscribe” button on their own.

**12. Customer Retention/Lost Customer**

*Why It’s Important*

The Digital Marketing Association reports that “[e]mails triggered by behavior were responsible for 30 percent of revenue in 2014, up from 17 percent in 2013.” Though “behavior” can be defined broadly, there’s no doubt that customer retention series can make a difference in energizing your list and driving conversions.

*How to Do It*

* Unlike a “Come Back Email,” a “Lost Customer” message is intended to be your final salvo in your subscriber relationships. Because this is your last chance to retain a subscriber, pull out your big guns. Offer the biggest promotion you can afford to do profitably, based on the benefits that are most likely to appeal to your subscribers.

* Be firm, but clear. Whether you do this over a single message or a series of emails, be clear that you will be removing the subscriber from your list in order to prevent miscommunications.

**13. Confirmation Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

Experian found that “confirmation emails had average click-through rates from 12 to 20 percent, approximately five times the rate of bulk mailings. The same trend held across any email metric including open rates, revenue-per-email and transaction rate.”


*How to Do It*

* Don’t be boring. Customers expect to receive confirmation emails, but they expect them to be dry and boring. Surprising them leads to greater engagement.

* Build recommendations into your confirmation messages (either manually or using an automated tool). Health and wellness company Isabella saw an 111% higher conversion rate by building in product recommendations over their existing sales and alert messages.

**14. Review Request Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

According to BrightLocal, “72% of buyers will take action only after reading a positive review.”

*How to Do It*

* Incentivize buyers to leave comments. This strategy tends to work best with in-person review requests (as in the classic case of waitresses using mints to score higher restaurant tips), but can be communicated effectively via email as well. The key is offering a compelling enough incentive to get reviews, without giving so much away that the promotion becomes unprofitable.

* If you don’t want to use a promotion, Brian Patterson, writing for MarketingLand, suggests making the request as personal-sounding as possible. “Have the email come from a real person’s email address (even better, have it come from a name they’d recognize, such as someone they worked with).” Further, he elaborates, “[h]ave the email written as a personal request from that same person.”

**15. Referral Request Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

Nielsen researchers report that “[p]eople are 4 times more likely to buy when referred by a friend.”

*How to Do It*

* Leverage reciprocity. People who feel they’ve received something want to give something in return. Rewarding both the referrer and the referee drives this effect to create successful referral promotions.

* Keep things simple. If your referral scheme is too complicated, subscribers won’t take advantage. Need help getting your referral program set up? RewardStream has customizable Refer-a-Friend software built to get you more customers.

**16. Thank You Email**

*Why It’s Important*

Magdalena Georgieva, writing for Hubspot, shares the following incredible statistics: “We took a look at 21 of our existing thank-you emails and found that, on average, they generated a 42% open rate and a 14% CTR. For comparison, we then looked at the generic marketing emails we’ve sent to one group of our buyer personas. The sample used here was larger – 131 emails – which, on average, generated a 12% open rate and a 6% CTR.”

*How to Do It*

* Test, test, test. A thank you message is a perfect spot for an upsell or cross-sell CTA, but you’ll need to do some A/B split testing to determine which offers your buyers respond best to.

* Keep it simple. Flatspot’s thank you is undoubtedly beautiful, but don’t skip this email structure if your design skills aren’t strong. Georgieva shared the following example of a plain text thank you email that’s proven effective for her team:

**17. Top Customer Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

eMarketer data suggests that “81% of online shoppers who receive emails based on previous shopping habits were at least somewhat likely to make a purchase as a result of targeted email.”

*How to Do It*

* Determine what makes a top customer a top customer. In Sephora’s case, achieving VIB status requires $350 in purchases in a calendar year; VIB Rouge members are those who have spent $1,000 or more.

* Implement necessary segmenting tools. If you track only online purchases, you’ll need a specific filter or trigger to inform your email automation program when a top customer threshold has been passed. If you sell both online and offline, you’ll need a system that tracks both.

* Make people feel special. Besides the logistics associated with running them, effective top customer promotions are all about getting customers to buy into the status they’ve achieved. Treat your top customers well, and they’ll keep coming back for more.

**18. Trending Topic Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

According to the Fluttermail blog, “Incorporating trending topics into your campaigns shows that you are fast-acting and “in the know.” It also gives your customers something popular and recognizable to equate your campaign with and can spur them into action”.

*How to Do It*

* Choose an appropriate trending topic. Being controversial can earn you some quick views, but it isn’t the right approach for all brands. Pick a topic that’s likely to interest your audience and drive positive brand sentiment at the same time.

* Be timely. Trending topic emails only work if you send them when they’re… well, trending. If it’s going to take you a week to get your blast and its associated creatives through your review process, go ahead and skip this one.

**19. Holiday-Specific**

*Why It’s Important*

In 2015, holiday retail sales climbed to $626.1 billion, up 3% from 2014, according the National Retail Federation. More people are buying online than ever before, and holiday sales emails help you reach these consumers.

*How to Do It*

* Make your email mobile-friendly. Marketing Dive estimates that “76 percent of Black Friday emails and 63 percent of Cyber Monday emails were opened on a mobile device” in 2015. Don’t frustrate these users with messages that only display appropriately on desktop computers.

*Make it easy for customers to buy. Brafton reports that “41 percent of retailers will use ‘Buy Now’ buttons in their email marketing,” and suggests that doing so could improve your holiday sales email conversion rates.

**20. Birthday/Anniversary Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

Experian reports that birthday emails enjoy 481% higher transaction rates than promotional emails.

*How to Do It*

* Offer a special coupon code. Sephora does this in the example above by adding a special birthday offer that maintains engagement and encourages purchases.

* Even if you choose not to include a gift, a simple note to a subscriber that celebrates a certain milestone helps to build brand affinity with your company.

**21. Targeted Urgent Offers**

*Why It’s Important*

Hubspot has seen an email opt-in lift of 8% by introducing scarcity (in this case, a limited time-only offer) into one of its free report download landing pages.

*How to Do It*

* Get even more granular. In the example above, Banana Republic takes things one step further, limiting discounts to specific time periods in order to increase the urgency subscribers feel.

* Though limiting your sales window could ultimately limit your total conversions, this type of email can be very effective when sent to the appropriate segment.

**22. Industry News and Event Updates**

*Why It’s Important*

Aberdeen suggests that “[P]ersonalized email messages improve click-through rates by an average of 14% and conversions by 10%.”

*How to Do It*

* Use advanced segmentation features to personalize your messages to feature the news and events individual subscribers want to see. Many experts predict that hyper-personalization is the future of email marketing.

**23. Triggered Behavior/Remarketing Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

Forrester Research found that “remarketing emails can generate nearly four times more revenue and 18 times greater net profits compared with marketing using simply untargeted mailings.”

*How to Do It*

* This could be an abandoned cart, a specific product they viewed, a form that was left mid-completion, or any other trigger your marketing automation systems are able to detect.

**24. Social Call to Action**

*Why It’s Important*

Email can be used to drive the creation of user-generated content, which can be used in ads to get 4x higher click-through rates and a 50% drop in cost-per-click than average.

*How to Do It*

* Come up with a hashtag based on a UGC campaign and encourage customers to share their content with you socially.

* If you don’t have the audience yet to support such a campaign, consider partnering with influencers who can help kick things off with their followers.

**25. Re-Engagement Drip Campaign**

*Why It’s Important*

We discussed re-engagement earlier, but what if you’re afraid a single message isn’t enough to re-awaken potential customers that you don’t want to lose?

*How to Do It*

* Map out a series of re-engagement messages, all of which culminate in a final “ask” for continued communication.

* As with single “Lost Customer” messages, offer discount codes, promotions and more if your audience responds well. If they don’t, don’t be afraid to say goodbye.

*26. Social Connection Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

Depending on the type of platform you run, notifying subscribers whenever relevant engagements are happening on your network can be a great way to boost connections.

*How to Do It*

If subscriber notification messages are likely to encourage your list members to return to your site, test different message styles and send frequencies. Some lists may prefer individual notifications, while others may prefer to see a summary of all the interactions that have occurred over a set period of time.

**27. Product Education Emails**

*Why It’s Important*

According to Hannah Stacey, writing for Ometria, “It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that effective e-commerce marketing ends with a customer buying something. The problem with this way of thinking is that it fails to take into account one major caveat: that retaining a customer is far more valuable in the long-run than acquiring a new one. And when you start focusing on retention, a customer making a purchase actually marks the beginning of the process, not the end.”

*How to Do It*

*Build out a value-added series that shows customers how to use the product they’ve just purchased, touching on such important issues as safe use, assembly, storage, and cleaning.

**28. Apology Email**

*Why It’s Important*

Hopefully, you never have to use this type of email, but it’s better to have one in your back pocket than to find yourself scrambling to issue a hasty apology when mistakes occur on your end.

*How to Do It:*

Don’t wait. Put together a template apology message now, leaving room to add in the relevant details later. You’ll be glad to have it in the unfortunate event it’s required.

**29. Cross-Sell/Upsell Email**

*Why It’s Important*

By some estimates, it costs five times more to get a new customer than it does to sell to an existing one. That’s why cross-sell and upsell messages are so important to your email marketing campaigns.

*How to Do It*

If your site doesn’t use a renewal model, this type of message could easily be tweaked to pitch complementary products or to encourage past purchasers to upgrade the items they’ve already bought.

**30. Social/Community Activism**

*Why It’s Important*

Karen Freeman, writing for the Harvard Business Review, asserts that “customers don’t care much about interaction with businesses – instead they feel most engaged (and buy more) when they believe they share values with the company.”

*How to Do It*

* Don’t do good as a company for the sole purpose of sending out this type of message (and certainly don’t lie about your company’s charitable acts); doing so will come across as disingenuous.

* Do feature your good works as part of your company’s story in an authentic way that’ll resonate with your subscribers.",2,17,2016-12-22,ECOM,0.040387140959501265,0.9229255676269531,0.03668726533651352
ecommerce,Hosting ecomm site's product videos - why not just use YouTube?,"My company recently moved all our embedded product videos from our old self-hosted, Flash-based player to an external service with a nice modern embeddable video player.

But, I've been wondering...why not just use YouTube? It seems like that would be a far better solution for a number of reasons:

* As far as I know, it's FREE. Maybe you need to pay a bit to make sure that ads aren't appearing before your videos when you embed them (I have no idea).
* Can be embedded anywhere.
* Mobile friendly.
* You can turn off parts of the UI you don't want, and even customize some of its looks and behavior.
* You get lots of back-end analytics info.
* It's easier to keep your YouTube channel content up to date, since you only need to upload videos to one location.
* Everybody is already familiar with it, and the UI is very good.
* The player automatically adjusts the video quality for your screen and connection speed.
* Who has better streaming servers than Google? Almost nobody.

The only things I can think of that could be points of contention are:

* **Maybe there are YouTube policies that prohibit this type of use.** I have no idea. But I assume they would be up for almost anything that earns them money.
* Possible unwanted ads. But I assume you can get rid of those somehow. (Is it as easy as using the ""do not monetize"" feature?)
* Having to deal with YouTubers. But this can be mitigated quite a bit.
* Retooling our content/database systems to work with it. Sure that's a pain, but it's nothing we can't do, and I assume it would be a good long-term investment. Plus, I'm sure Google has a good API for it.

Is there anything I'm overlooking? This seems like something I should try to push for when we do our next big site update, to save the company some money and hassle.

So I've been thinking of moving my site to shopify as I'm tired of always having to update plugins. But the expense is starting to mount up and I can't see how to make it financially viable.

For example, if you were building the next crutchfield, would you be writing all those installation guides yourself, or would you just curate existing content that already exists on the web? Can I embed someone else's YouTube video on my site?",2,3,2016-12-22,ECOM,0.016346801072359085,0.9305638670921326,0.05308937653899193
ecommerce,"Best App for complex price matrix? (Bulk Discounts, Mixes of differently priced colors &amp; sizes, etc.)","I work for a screen-printing and embroidery company, and we're looking to create a new online store.

I tried Squarespace first, but their ""product variant"" model couldn't account for the huge number of variables in our pricing.
Ideally, I'd like something like [this](https://www.discountmugs.com/product/g2000-wholesale-custom-printed-gildan-ultra-cotton-tees/) or even just [this](http://www.kustomkoozies.com/kooziez/wearables-c-5/tshirts-gildan-heavy-cotton-g500-p-8.html) without having to pay someone to code it from scratch.

Looking into Shopify, I found a number of Apps that seem to come close, particularly [Quantity Breaks](https://boldcommerce.com/apps/quantity-breaks-shopify-app), and [Product Options](https://boldcommerce.com/apps/product-options-shopify-app) by Bold.

Without having tried those specific apps (or even fully committed to Shopify yet), I'm wondering if anyone else can recommend a solution for this problem:

We have six pricing tiers based on order quantity (1 to 11, 12 to 23, 24-35. etc...), and within those tiers are 2 differently-priced size and color categories per item (White shirts are cheaper than Color, and 2X+ sizes are more expensive than Sm-XL sizes).
I'd like customers to be able to pick a variety of sizes and colors, and then calculate cost based on which Price Tier their total number of shirts falls under.

For example:
Total Cost = (12 White Shirts, Sizes S-XL, at Price Per Unit A) + (6 White Shirts, Sizes 2X-3X, at PPU B) + (6 Color Shirts, Sizes S-XL, at PPU C), with PPU A, B, and C each being determined by the total shirts (24) falling under Price Tier 2.

If a combination of [Quantity Breaks](https://boldcommerce.com/apps/quantity-breaks-shopify-app) and [Product Options](https://boldcommerce.com/apps/product-options-shopify-app) can handle it, great!
If not, I'll be very grateful for your suggestions.

ecommerce,Shipping solutions on shopify platform?,"Site still not launched,  am still looking at processes and researching marketing.

 Essentially if I were to buy an item that I have right now that weighs 10-15lb and select priority shipping would be a huge problem.

I have the supplier based in idaho, and if I were to purchase my product from my site select priority ,  send the order to the wolesaler under priority it would cost an additional $67, the customer (me) does not see the correct shipping charge, because the origin shipping location is set at my entities location.  

The simple fix would be to set shipping origin to my suppliers location and calculate from there but currently I have 2 suppliers and am probably going to have 4.

It seems I only have the ability to set shipping origin to one of those suppliers. And there is no way to solve the problem of a customer selecting products from multiple suppliers.

To make matters worse, one of the largest competitors in my niche offers free standard shipping, not really sure how he absorbs the cost since I know he is using the same supplier that offers those heavier items.

I went to change the DNS info to switch over, but realized the email was pointing to the domain and not the server IP, which they say it should, once you switch. I tried to do that but it wouldn't let me. Possibly because it needs to be set to 'Class A' instead of CNAME first? Not sure. I tried contacting support numerous times, but each time my ticket was rejected, because they said the email address wasn't associated with the account... even though they just sent me a bunch of welcome emails on that exact address.

How do I achieve this? Do I need to buy one of the plugins for WC that allows more customisation?

ecommerce,Creating dropshipping infrastructure,"My family is in the wholesale jewelry business, and two years ago I started their e-comerce/dropshipping business. We now sell through a variety of platforms including Amazon, FBA, overstock, and a bunch of retail websites (JCP, Sears, Bluestem etc...)

To clarify, we hold inventory and upload onto each respective site. We currently do not have our own website. 

I've come to the point where I've realized that there is a ton of opportunity in this business, but also a crazy amount of operational overhead and our current infrastructure is no longer suitable for this business. Need some insight on how to build out an infrastructure suitable for the online vendor business. 

Inventory Cataloging - we were using excel, but now we're using Ragic to manage all our inventory. Jewelry has a lot of product spec requirements across the board, and ragic has been great so far. 

Accounting: Nightmare. every site does accounting different and has so many fees and costs charged in different ways. I'm thinking of switching our current system to Xero and adding integrations, but open to advice 

Inventory management: we're using an access database. not very useful when trying to keep inventory managed in realtime.

I'm sure I'm missing other parts of what is needed, but would love feedback or advice on this.

Then, we had 27 visitors add candles to their carts, AWESOME but at the end of the day we had 0 conversions, and 26/27 carts were abandoned, leaving $770 (~$29 average ticket) hung out to dry NOT AWESOME. Usually when people come to our site they are very likely to buy because they are there for 1 reason, to buy. So we very rarely see carts get abandoned.

Now the increase in traffic came from us being mentioned in a popular thread yesterday. Now the thread had nothing to do directly with candles (our product) but we gained traffic none the less, and of those people we had people adding our products to their carts. Our process to check out (I think) is pretty straight forward, not confusing, and light weight. We also have free shipping on ALL orders. So... My explanation (to make myself feel better) is that we captured a TON of traffic, that had zero intention to buy, and there for, they did not buy.

shopify,New to web development and need pointers for a customer survey application,"Hey everyone,

I apologize if this question is too vague. However, I am in the beginning stages of this project. For background, I have minimal web development experience, but my day job is as an embedded systems engineer (C/C++). I have recently had a business idea and would like to build a Shopify store. However, from what I can tell I will need to develop a custom application to get the functionality I desire.

The general goal of the project is to build an e-commerce site that recommends a cart of products based on the customer's responses to a survey, and not using the traditional storefront. I want the survey to exist on a single page of the website and have questions presented to the customer one at a time. Additionally, I do not want to use the standard radio buttons that traditional surveys use. I envision the customer being presented with 3-6 options, and a selection being made by clicking a large button with a custom graphic and text on it. The next question would then scroll onto the page. In addition to their responses, I would like to incorporate factors such as inventory and self-defined product details. The algorithm I implement would consider all responses and considerations to create a cart of options and present them to the customer. At this time they would be able to choose to replace one item from a selection of similar items. In the future, I would like to add some UI to the admin page to enable modification of the algorithm logic, and extract insights from customer's answers.

I have been reading through the Shopify app documentation/tutorials. However, most of what I have found discusses making applications for admin purposes, and not creating this functionality. It is also entirely possible that I am blind to a simple solution due to my lack of web experience. 

Any information you may have to get me started in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.",2,2,2016-12-31,ECOM,0.029127296060323715,0.9355082511901855,0.03536444529891014
