ecommerce,Moving tech-illiterate friend from eBay to his own site. What's an easy to use eCommerce script I can install for him?,"A friend of mine who sells clothing on eBay wants to get away from their fees, the only problem is... He's fairly technologically illiterate. He's been able to work eBay fine on his own for the past few years, but wants his own site now.

Problem is... All of the eCommerce scripts I've found are **way** too complex, they have 5+ tabs of multiple pages of information to fill out, require Model #s (OpenCart, which would be my first choice otherwise) and other information for adding new products that he'll never use in a million years.

So is there something that's really easy to use, that an eBay seller could figure out pretty quickly? Preferably something that lets me add more fields as he needs them, rather than having hundreds he won't ever use that I have to manually remove the code to.

Really he just needs all of the basic eCommerce stuff (Shopping cart, checkout, product listing, search, etc.), and a simple way to add products with images, name, description, and a few custom fields.",11,5,2013-02-04,ECOM,0.03231331333518028,0.935707151889801,0.0319795198738575

ecommerce,Ecommerce alternatives for a small business,"www.clemson4wheel.com

We run a ecommerce front end called CPOnline from Radiant Counterpoint. It has integrated functionallty with the point of sale system we use called Counterpoint SQL. We are looking to upgrade to a more up-to-date and functional system with better shipping options, Better layouts and up to date web standards. The current platform is extremly lacking. No doctype, No javascript, flash or web standards at all. Everything you do with it has to have some kind of work around or shady way of functioning. 

We are approaching our bandwith limits of the platform with outrageous charges and unable to expand.  Currently we have around 5000 (give or take) SKUs online.

Radiant was recently aquired by NCR and they updated their platform using the Magento community source and included integration with the Counterpoint POS system. To upgrade to the new platform requires giving up a percentage of sales which is a huge turn off. 

http://www.ncrretailonline.com/

I understand the NCR is based off Magento Community (open source). It has the basic functionallity of Magento and one theme. The normal community add-ons, themes and other Magento packages will not work on the platform.  All customization has to be done with css or xml and even that functionality is dependent on my problem solving skills. Any other custimization NCR will want to charge you for as with their last cponline platform. 

The good thing about the platform is the Counterpoint SQL integration and the ease of use that they claim migrating from our current site.


Whats the alternatives? Ive looked into Magento GO http://go.magento.com/, BigCommerce http://www.bigcommerce.com/, OScommerce http://www.oscommerce.com/, Shopify http://www.shopify.com/. 

From looks, appeal and cost I personally lean towards Magento GO. The pricing is good and without the % of sale fees of NCR. Good bandwith and good storage capabilities. 

The ability to add themes, plugins and addons. More shipping and cart options. Good SEO.  I also like the large community. Adds just a little extra layer of helpful information if you get stuck. Its pretty much the ""new"" NCR platform without the % fee and is more open with what you can do with it. 

The bad is the Counterpoint SQL Integration. Theres sites that claim to have products that integrate the two. The one below even claims to be a NCR resaler. Given this Im inclined to think integration wouldnt be to awful difficult. 

http://www.cpmagento.com/

Next on my list of likes is Shopify. It looks great and promising and shares many of the same features with Magento GO but I see no information online about integrating it with Counterpoint SQL. All but the highest pricing plan have a % based sales fee like NCR that my employer wants to stay clear of. 

So out of all of these options and considering our current platform, What would you go with and why? We have two people on site (myself and the Owner/Manager - aka Boss!) that are pretty technically inclined and hopefully able to migrate, upkeep and work on the site. If we do get stuck on a major problem I would assume hiring outside help is also a possibility.  

As with anything. We want to do it right the first time, this time. We dont want the problem of having to migrate again in 4 years because our platform just isnt up to date and competitive.  

I understand there is going to be a learning curve with any new platform. We want to make the migration as streamlined and cost effective as possible with no hidden surprises. 

Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Just for reference. The competition is the likes of

ecommerce,Ever been underqualified yet the employer still wanted a interview?,"Happened to me today. I have three years experience with a mom and pop ecommerce site. I do the graphic design, HTML, CSS,  New item imports (Data entry I guess), Social media and Advertising (email blast, banners, adsense etc).  

Well. Sending out resumes on Craigslist and I get a phone call back from what I think is a small mom and pop electrical supply company. 

I let him know I can do pretty much all he ask but I'm no expert at some of the duties. The qualifications on the craigslist post are immense. Looks like they want a Network Admin, Programmer, Grahic Designer, Market Specialist all in one. I stated over the phone I thought I might be under qualified for the position as the responsibilities seemed over whelming for one person. 

He still insisted on the interview even after my brutal honesty. I do a little research. Turns out they have what appears to be a show room and 3 warehouses in 3 upstate locations. They have a YellowPages hosted website with a couple of pages. No real ecommerce options.  Ok I tell myself. I can handle this. 

I drive 40 minutes to the interview. Walk in and think to myself ""Is this the right place?"" I just stepped into what looked like a old warehouse thats been transformed into a corporate base. I'm talking glass walls with meeting rooms. Projectors. Cubicles every where full of people. 

Im led into a meeting room. The VP of sales tells me how he does 12 million in sales a year. He needs someone to oversee the ecommerce side. Hes looking for a single person that can setup, diagnose and repair the servers in multiple locations, the data importation, shipping implementation,  manage the software of the office computers , the network security of the office, Handle the ecommerce website and take over the graphics and marketing from the consultants they have hired to jump start it.

I just tell him what I did over the phone. That his list is huge. This is like 3 full time positions merged into one. To find one person that can handle all of that any given work week is a needle in a haystack. We go over what I do at my current job and I explain to him the best I can how we import a sql database into our ecommerce solution and it updates every 30 minutes on the inventory etc. Its all going good. Closing arguments I bring up again how hes looking for one person to fill multiple roles and its a little overwhelming. 

He states ""Do you lack personal confidence?"". Im kind of taken back by the question and I just tell him that ""No. I dont lack confidence. (Im extremely confident. Overly confident. I can do anything I put my mind to) I could sit here and lie to your face, pretend Im someone Im not but No... Im just being honest. I can do every thing that you listed and have experience doing everything you stated just not on such a large scale and not doing it all at ONCE. You should be looking for a graduate degree computer science seasoned professional""

After some small talk about what I do with my free time ( I only work part time atm, explained I have kids and they are my life when Im not working). We talk about salary. I explain to him and break down what I need as a minimum which is $18 an hour. After the drive every day would come out to $15 an hour. I explain to him that its not about the money for me. Im in the work force because I choose to be in the work force and I love what I do. I could easily qualify for disability (HCM, Heart defect) and rely on my wifes income but I choose not to. I enjoy my work.  

He states hes had the position open for over a year and he just cant find the right person.  He tells me has a couple of more people to interview and that he planned on hiring the most qualfied and experienced one and that he would get back in touch with me within the week. 

Im not sure what to think.  He qouted me a starting salary of 55k and said a 100k wasnt out of the discussion for the right person. I dont need or want that kind of money and I dont want to get in over my head at the same time. 

Why did he even call me for the interview for such a high level position? Why the games? Boggles my mind.",0,0,2013-02-07,ECOM,0.04610335826873779,0.9258734583854675,0.028023136779665947

I've been hired to build a new ecommerce site for a fishing tackle company, and one of the client's needs has me hung up on choosing the right software for his store:

Magento allows for multiple shipments, but I cannot process multiple invoices through Authorize.net, so it's no good.

He doesn't have the resources to manage the inventory online, so there is no way he can mark items as out of stock when they go out of stock, and so on.

ecommerce,X-Cart Security Bulletin: 15th Feb 2013,"I've just got to work today and found this in my inbox, it might be helpful to some on here.



&gt;Dear X-Cart customer,

&gt;During internal audit activities we found several moderate security issues that make X-Cart potentially vulnerable to attackers who wish to gain access to the application back-end.

&gt;The following security improvements have been included into this update: 

&gt; * Number of XSS vulnerabilities

&gt; * Hacker could gain access to the administration back end of the store if they manage to dump data from the database;

&gt; * Malefactor  could upload and run a malicious script via the administration back end of the store; use a special Smarty tag to gain control over X-Cart software  

&gt; * Archives could be downloaded from the store's root if they are stored there

&gt; * Fulfillment staff could gain full access to the administration back end by sending a specially crafted request

&gt; * Customer could gain access to the administration back end by setting up a special type of customer account


&gt;**SEVERITY:** *Moderate*



&gt;**IMPACT:**

&gt;A malicious user can gain access to the application back-end.

&gt;**AFFECTED VERSIONS:**

&gt; * All versions older than v4.5.5.

&gt; * X-Cart v4.5.5 is not affected.

&gt; * The security patches for versions 4.1.12, 4.2.3, 4.3.2, 4.4.5 and all existing versions of 4.5.x branch before 

&gt; * X-Cart 4.5.5 are available in the File Area of your HelpDesk accounts.


&gt;**SOLUTION:**

&gt;We strongly recommend X-Cart users to install the security fix available in the HelpDesk 'File Area'. Installation instructions can be found in the README.txt file attached to the .tgz archive.
If you are using X-Cart versions older than specified above, before applying this security patch you *have to* apply all the previous security patches.

&gt;You can find all the previous security patches in the ""File area"" section of the Support HelpDesk.

&gt;Please make sure the patch is applied. We will be happy to offer our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us, if you have not found your version in the list above or if have any questions.  

&gt;If you have active support subscription,  you should not bother at all, just create a new ticket with patch application request and we will apply it for you: we need approval to work on your server.

So my question regards payment processing... Lets say I use shopify and drop-ship socks. I get an order for $30, and need to pay the drop-shipper $15. However, because I am using paypal, it takes a few days for the $30 to go into my bank account... however, i need to place the order today! So with that said, would drop-shippers send your order same day, and charge your card in the following three days or so? If not, would I have to go out of pocket? -- How does this work?!

ecommerce,"I'm looking for a payment gateway for my future website. I'm based in Canada, but will be doing business in Canada and the US. Does anyone have any suggestions for cheap and easy to use gateways?","I think I will design with website with volusion. I know they offer their own gateway service, but the 2.17% they charge seems high.

edit #1: just read that volusion's gateway can not be used by Canadians.
edit #2: I found this company http://www.authorize.net/solutions/merchantsolutions/pricing/ . They look really good. Will I be charged additional money by the credit card companies, on top of the $0.10 per transaction that they charge me?",8,3,2013-02-27,ECOM,0.013097995892167091,0.8497706651687622,0.13713137805461884
ecommerce,"Can anyone recommend an effective, simple, platform with easy integration to Ebay?","Already have a main business but I'm looking at setting up a sideline as simply as possible.

The product line I'm looking at sells very well on Ebay as is so I need to integrate as simply as possible.

I was thinking Magneto GO but it doesn't seem to advertise its Ebay integration very much so I'm a bit uncertain.",0,1,2013-02-27,ECOM,0.03256923332810402,0.9123609662055969,0.05506976693868637

ecommerce,Magento GO VS Magento Community,"We are moving our 6000SKU site over to MagentoGO. Currently we are just testing data migration and I've set up a mock site on the trial. Im no pro css, php or html coder but I do have a little experience. Im debating myself whether we actually need to go with MagentoGO or Magento Community. 

The only thing GO has going for it is the support and PCI compliance. I used support chat live and they cant help with any design issues which caught me as a WTF thats 99% of issues. 

 Is PCI compliance really a big deal? The lack of themes, Addons and Extensions of GO are are really getting me down as well. I love the fact that I can have a local clone of the Magento Community to do testing on. 

 Im a graphic designer by trade thats playing web designer for a small business. I dont want to get in over my head. Can you function with Magento Community without knowing PHP or advanced CSS? 

Who do you recommend as a Hosting solution? I was thinking Hostgator as I host personal sites with them but they told me I would want the Tier 5 VPS which is pretty dang pricey. Do we really need a high end dedicated VPS?  We are currently at 6,000 SKUs and about 200 visitors a day.",1,1,2013-02-28,ECOM,0.03250005841255188,0.9315006732940674,0.03599925339221954
