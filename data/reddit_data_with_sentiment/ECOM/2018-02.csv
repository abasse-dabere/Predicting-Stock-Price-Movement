ecommerce,Run a dropshipping business from outside of the US?,"Hello

I live in Uruguay, and plan to start a t-shirt selling business locally, not having anything to do with selling through the internet.

However, I believe that my designs could do well and people in the US would buy them.

My question is, is it possible to create a Shopify account where I design t-shirts and sell them online to people in the US, have them shipped to them and receive payment to my paypal so I can withdraw in Uruguay?

ecommerce,"Sudden, abnormal spike in sales that is sporadic and unexplainable","We have a product line with less than 10 SKUs that has been selling next to nothing that is suddenly seeing an abnormal spike in sales.

In the 2nd week of January, it went from selling 0 a day to 30 a day on Amazon only (but not our shopify site) for a few days, and then continued to flatline.

Then about a week later, on the 3rd week of January, our Shopify site suddenly started seeing 30 sales a day, as well (but no activity whatsoever on Amazon). This is strange because, 

1. The sales are sporadic, as in 30 sales one day and then 0 the next, and then 20 sales the next day again. 

2. No one person has bought more than 2 items (except for one guy that bought 10 at one time)

3. The spikes are not happening concurrently on shopify and amazon, which we would expect if this was an organic increase in interest.

4. We did nothing different with the product group vis-a-vis marketing; nothing whatsoever.

Technically, we don't have the exact same SKUs on Amazon and Shopify but they're basically the same product, at similar price points. We'd think it's someone trying to flip our products but the orders are coming in from multiple people from all over the country (US). But if you consider the factors above, it's hard to believe this is all due to an organic increase in interest.

Any ideas about what's going on? I'm just trying to wrap our heads around this phenomenon.",18,5,2018-02-01,ECOM,0.0365399532020092,0.9198243021965027,0.04363572597503662

ecommerce,Did any of you guys implemented new paypal express v4 API?,"Guys hi,

As the title says i am wondering if any of you tried new paypal express checkout v4?

I just saw it today, seems like it was our for some time. And looks like it's definitely improvement from what they had before.

You can read on it here:

[PayPal Express Checkout Integration](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/express-checkout/integration-jsv4/)

[Interactive Demo](https://developer.paypal.com/demo/checkout/#/pattern/server)

[Medium Article](https://medium.com/@bluepnume/less-is-more-reducing-thousands-of-paypal-buttons-into-a-single-iframe-using-xcomponent-d902d71d8875)

They are saying ""To increase conversions and personalize the buyer's checkout experience, implement PayPal's JavaScript-based checkout flow in all your PayPal checkout integrations. The checkout.js script keeps the buyer on your site during the entire checkout and provides smart button capabilities. 

Integrations using static buttons and full-page redirects are deprecated, however PayPal supports existing integrations.""

dropship,HOW TO GROW INSTAGRAM 2018,"Yo, anyone here doing E-Com? If you are I got something important to tell you, with 2018 already underway and the competition rising, its only gonna get tougher if you havn’t come up with a long term brand for yourself and your business. For people with things such as online stores selling products and services, branding is a key point to success and recognition. 

Building a personal brand on instagram will allow you to be able to advertise all your products and stores no matter what niche they are in or how they relate to a fan/customer. Once a fan is engaged with you and trusts you as a brand and person, then they are much more likely to buy something from you no matter what it is, and this whole process will increase your sales hugely. 

Starting a brand on instagram is easy if you stick to 5 rules:
- Tell a story that people can relate to
- Make people remember bases on your content and who you are
- Connect with people that are related to your content.
- Dont be afraid to reinvest into yourself, you are the best imvestment you can make
- BE CONSISTENT

If anyone here wants to get started with building there instagram brand NOW then hmu asap",1,3,2018-02-02,ECOM,0.016134921461343765,0.9124695062637329,0.07139555364847183

ecommerce,Haggle,"Hey guys, a friend and I had an idea that relates to ecommerce, and we think it's an interesting idea, but, then again, we have a combined experience of 0 years in this space. We'd love to get some feedback/criticism before we seriously consider working on this.

Background:
So, we notice the trend with smaller sites (Basically not Amazon) is to try and personalize towards their niche.
Real money can be made if you can know and appeal to your niche.

The idea:
Well, our thought is that being able to negotiate price is somewhat the ""apex"" of personalization. Our website add-on would allow customers to submit deals they would want and for the business owners to bargain with the customers.
For example, say I go to buy a pair of pants and the price is $60. I could bargain that I'd pay $50 or I'd pay $55 if I got $3 dollars off a pack of socks.
In future iterations, we would provide an automated service where, based on owner preferences, so this bargaining would happen without the business owner having to be active.

Our theory on why owners would use this:
1. More effectively collect data/understand the customer
2. Not losing out on a potential sale

So, what do you guys think?",2,3,2018-02-02,ECOM,0.02921145409345627,0.930622398853302,0.040166132152080536

ecommerce,How to deal with Fraud? - I FOUND MY FRAUDSTER ONLINE,"I need advice - what do I do in this situation?

I sold a $700 product about 4 weeks ago in my online store. There were no fraud alerts so we shipped it FedEx Direct Signature Required (drop shipped from the manufacturer). This means the person must present their ID and sign to receive the package. It was delivered and the signature matched the name on file. 

Yesterday I got a Fraudulent chargeback on the order. At first, I thought no way, we have their signature on file - but then I looked into the billing and shipping details and I'm concerned. While the name matches, billing and shipping addresses don't match, and the billing details is the address of a hospital.

I looked up the phone number on FB to see if there was an account attached, and a trashy looking woman with the nickname ""Mobwife"" shows up (different name than the customer). I stalked her online and she runs a ""home business"" out of that shipping address and posts pictures of money on her page...

What do I do? Is there any hope here? 

Do I file the chargeback with all the details I have indicating it was delivered and signed for? Do I seek insurance through FedEx for potentially taking the wrong signature? Do I file a police report?

Hi all, I'm just wanting advice about my situation. I'm a British citizen living in the Czech Republic and I'm setting up a tour service in the Czech Republic. Payments and bookings are done online, via my Squarespace website, but unfortunately the card payment service partnered with Squarespace (Stripe) isn't in the Czech Republic yet. So I figured I'd create a UK account to link it to as Stripe do operate in the UK. 

Now, I'm not sure of the implications of this situation, I'll be taking payments online, to a bank account in the UK, for a service rendered in the Czech Republic. Would I have to pay tax in the Czech Republic as well as the UK? I od just set up a Czech bank account from it, but stripe doesn't work with czech accounts . Does anyone know any other ramifications I'm unaware of? Just puzzled by the whole situation.

I built our current site with Wordpress, which I'm very familiar with, so my first thought is to go with WooCommerce. I'm just not sure about the scalability. We estimate we'll be selling between $1m to $2m a year, spread over roughly 10 products. I imagine WooCommerce would be suitable at this level, but if we were to increase our product line to say 50 products with variants, and increase total revenue, would we be able to manage with WooCommerce? 

I've been looking at Magento as an alternative, but reading mixed reviews. I'll also be the only person building out the site, so I'm a bit concerned with how much time it would take to learn and implement.

dropship,a niche that has no specific targets?,"Hey guys,
I have been dropshipping on eBay for a while now and now I want to expand it to a Shopify store.
I picked a niche and the products sold quite well on eBay. However, I can't quite see the commonalities that my customers have. I ship worldwide so they come from different countries. They are of different age groups judging from their user names.
The niche itself (some sorts of electical tool) also does not relate to a specific group of customer. 
Does it mean it is not a good niche to have in a Shopify store? If I have to advertise my store I really don't know what the targets should be demographically. I'm afraid that it will only sell well on eBay and I should pick another niche if I plan to open a Shopify store.

ecommerce,Shipping Label Management,"Hi,

I am looking for a software that will help automate and manage our shipping label process. Our business sells online on websites such as JCP, Overstock, Sears, etc... 

We are struggling with the shipping label portion of the fulfillment process. Right now we are manually making each shipping label and are using multiple platforms. 

E.g. Most of the retail brands (JCP, Sears, Overstock, etc..) all provide us with 3PB, which is great since we dont need to worry about shipping expenses, but at the same time we have to juggle multiple accounts/profiles on the UPS/Fedex websites. 

Then for items for which we pay shipping for, we either use shipgooder to get the cheapest labels or back to fedex/ups for more expensive items.

It's getting to be quite cumbersome to keep making each shipping label one-by-one, shuffling through different billing accounts, and juggling multiple platforms.

Is there any tool/software that helps with this?

Thanks in advance",2,2,2018-02-06,ECOM,0.032090649008750916,0.9215909242630005,0.04631848633289337
dropship,"OK real talk, I am totally sick of the ""Youtube Vid disguised as information"" posts.","For the record, not at all against someone making an informative youtube video.

BUT the idea of promoting your youtube channel with the same cookie-cutter formula that Dropship Lifestyle and friends use is **really fucking tiring.**

I'm going to go ahead and break down how 95% of these youtube videos are formatted.

**1.** ""Look at this utterly obscene result!""

**2.** ""Hi, I'm an Attractive Character. I'm trying to promote by having the non-genuine personality of a successful wealthy person in the hopes you'll want to emulate me and join my tribe.""

**3.** ""So, how about that impossible result, huh? It was all because of this *one weird trick*, which only takes 30 seconds to explain and is in the first 6 chapters of any given book on ecommerce, but it's going to take me a 10 minute youtube video to explain it!""

Here's where the videos branch into one of two options.

**4a.** ""And you can do this too by simply following these three poorly-explained steps that I don't fully understand but want to sell to you!""

**4b.** ""Here's a basic explanation, but the *full* explanation takes *insert resource* to explain, and this is just a low-level video.

(sometimes, this step is skipped entirely.)

**5.** ""Well, thanks for watching! This has been a 6-15 minute video about *virtually nothing,* subscribe to my youtube channel so I can plug my -insert product or service here- because **value!!1!**""

This isn't every video. Some do the formula better, some worse, but this is generally the gist of things.

That said, again, this is not an end-all-be-all for youtube videos being posted here. Some (emphasis on some) have good content, even if they're not particularly amazing quality. That said, I'd go so far as to call for a ban on these posts. Here's some criteria that should be used to bypass such a ban.

**1) Contribute to the discussion, freeloaders.** If you want to run an ad for your class or whatever, fine. *Buy an ad.* Posting to a community without contributing to it is a premiere sin on reddit, however. Get some posts in on the people asking for advice and talking about their own problems and solutions. And since you're a bunch of self-motivated entrepeneurs, this can even be good for you - I only post here (top level or response) a couple times a month and I have *still* gotten more PMs asking for help from this sub than anywhere else. Demonstrate you actually know what you're doing and people will ask after you.

Note that *this is not a goddamn quota you fucking leeches.* Be a part of the community or don't, but if you don't want to be a part of it don't try to use and abuse it.

**2) If it's a video, make it a post.** Don't copy-paste a video-script, make some content that's *also* easily available in video form. If your primary intent is to inform your viewer, do it in such a way that I can read the post without having to sit through a 10-minute video of you stammering about it. And for fuck's sake, do *not* try and force your personality into the post. Don't start with ""hi guys, _ here, just a quick update"" or some other such BS. Save that for the people who actually want to know who you are. Qualify yourself. Don't try and commandeer the post with your personality.

It doesn't need to be clinical or essay-like. Just remove your ego. Want a good example of an informative post? [I posted an ABCs thread awhile ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/7bx7mj/the_abcs_of_dropshipping/) and I'd say that does the job pretty well.

**3) Edit your shit.** For real, anyone can crap out a 10-minute youtube video where you go over elementary-level bullets. I can do it on any given subject from medical science to celebrity gossip in about 30 minutes, and have it posted in another 10. These videos are low-grade garbage. Nobody wants to have to sit through a psudo-vlog in order to figure out how to do whatever it is you're doing, and nobody wants to watch you talk to a wall for 10+ minutes.

**4) Add a TL;DR.** This is optional, but necessary in many cases. If your entire topic can be fully explained in 2 sentences, that shit is not worth a 10 minute video essay no matter what.

**5) Stop setting off my bullshit meter.** Virtually everyone who reads things on this sub will have been ""sold to"" at some point, often by someone who's completely unqualified for the job. It really isn't *that* hard to tell when someone is full of shit. The easiest way to avoid this is to...

**6) Show actual results.** If you're not prepared to share, *don't.* It is completely fine and rational to not want to reveal your secrets, particularly those that might be compromising or induce difficult competition. *Just don't pretend that you're going to.* Seriously, this is not a hard concept to comprehend.

As far as I'm concerned, our mods (mod? /u/chrunchy Where you at) should start banning these low-effort posts unless they follow these rules. Hell, make me a mod for exactly this purpose and I'll do it.

I'm not unreasonable. I've bought online courses before and even worked for someone who created them. In both cases, I was pretty damn satisfied with the content I received, and that shit is *not* cheap. A lot of people's paid content is really great. But however good whatever thing you're promoting actually is, this is not an advertising space for it. Go away.",15,46,2018-02-07,ECOM,0.04676476679742336,0.9160921573638916,0.03714310098439455

ecommerce,Buying Shopify store vs Shopify buy now button on WordPress,"I need to set up an e-commerce site and have some Qs... First of all I had no idea you could buy a store on Shopify... I would prefer WordPress so I could use the Yoast plug-in for better SEO... However, it appears there are actual already built up websites with high traffic numbers and social media fans for sale on Shopify,which is tempting... Previously, you couldn't blog on a shopify account but now you can... So my question is do you subject yourself into a pay-to-play environment if you start out in the Shopify space? It seems like you have to have a ""buy now button“ to use Shopify, which entails paying them $9 per month for Shopify lite (versus the free but buggy third party WordPress plugin they canceled)... $9 a month is not a lot, granted that Shopify isn't then pushing you into some lower-tier hosting thing with an algorithm that penalizes you for not paying the higher monthly premium plans.

Hello there,

I am currently doing dropship for my online store. I sell mainly phone cases with different designs. All designs are made by me. I am thinking of buying in bulk and hold inventory so that I can control the packaging and shipping. 

However, my online store is offering about 100+ phone models right now. How should I order in bulk when there are so many models out there. Do you think I should only order popular models such as iPhone only? How should I deal with this?

woocommerce,automatewoo vs activecampaign vs conversio. Anybody have experiences with these platforms with woocommerce? Pros and Cons.,"Hi, I am setting up my new woocommerce store and trying to figure out what a good setup could be for email marketing and marketing automation for a boutique retail woocommerce shop. On the surface it looks like activecampaign can do all the most important features for me (abandon cart, follow up emails, email marketing, referrals, coupons etc.) but was wondering if anybody knows if all these features works well with woocommerce? or should i go for automatewoo as a native solution for woocommerce together with an email marketing program like mailchimp or does this make woocommerce very heavy and laggy? Then there is conversio.io that seems to be a solution similar to activecampaign but less flexible. Much appreciated for any advice or experience.

dropship,Need insight/help with recent FB Ad performance,"Hi there,

Sharing my experience and wondering if any old hands can provide insight on my situation and advise on how I can turn things around.

I have a year-old store with several previously profitable products. I would characterize it as mid-sized. Did nearly $700k last year in sales and up till early Feb had several profitable product campaigns running.

One of my issues I think, is that not having previous experience with online marketing, I am very conservative with scaling. I start with testing $5 daily budget ad sets and once they show traction, I duplicate at $50, then raise the budget every 3 days as recommended by my former FB account rep (more on that later). I tried starting the big budget duplicates at $100 to $250, but those never seem to work well for me for some reason.

I've been noticing CPAs skyrocketing in January but was still slightly profitable. Did well early Feb, thought perhaps the post-holiday slump was over and sales would pick up again.

On Monday, however, my ad sets suddenly flatlined. Sales are falling off a cliff, even for new products that were showing early signs of traction. 

In one case, a new product that sold 8 units in 2 days over 4 $5 ad sets suddenly just stopped selling altogether. 

In the meantime, ads manager started glitching. Ad sets would be in ""Pending Review"" the entire day, then go active just before midnight with most of the daily budget spent. When I checked the history, it showed that the ad sets were active almost right after I started them. Page posts editor wouldn't let me create new ad posts due to some API error. 

Facebook was terribly unhelpful. Support reps promised to get back within 1-3 days and never did. I wrote to an FB ""marketing expert"" who was supposed to be providing me with personalized support for my business. She responded with a stock response about how she was sorry to hear, and sorry, but she would not be working directly with me anymore. Now that I'm not spending thousands a day, I'm to contact their normal support staff. 

Am hearing from other dropshippers in a couple other communities that they are having similar experiences and it may have something to do with an ads manager update messing with the algorithm. On the other hand, I'm seeing a couple of store owners reporting that they're killing it with Purchase Conversions as low as $1.50. (They are also using $5 ad sets)
 
I've tried the usual things like targeting new interests, refreshing creatives, increasing new product testing, nothing seems to be working. It's not a website issue - I've not added any apps or made any changes to the design.

Where I used to get 2-8 sales an hour, I can now go up to 8 hours without a single sale. 

This wasn't a gradual decline, which is usually the sign of a product dying. This literally went from profitable/signs of traction to next to nothing in a day, then continuing for the week. I've had unprofitable days before, but nothing like what I'm seeing now.

Any advice from experienced dropshippers here who can provide any insight or advice on how I might be able to turn things around would be appreciated. Thank you!",7,5,2018-02-09,ECOM,0.09440698474645615,0.8732360005378723,0.032357051968574524

ecommerce,Supplier has a retail presence. Is my startup doomed to fail?,"I have decided to start up an e-commerce business selling personalised gifts and jewllery in the UK.  These border on the luxury market on focus on being high quality, handmade gifts which have a slightly higher price. 

I have been in contact with the supplier who have agreed to sign cards with signatures (with my logo on, sort of like business cards which confirm authenticity), offer to hand gift wrap every item as well as brand the packaging with my logo (white label dropshipping). They also provide optional RRP pricing, returns, next day delivery, as well as product descriptions and imagery. The dropshipper themselves don't offer any of this when selling their own products under their own brand.

The problem is they have a retail presence which concerns me. They are also listed on major marketplaces like Etsy using the same descriptions (I have been writing my own) and images. Therefore, I'm relying on pricing my items higher, a brand story, and offering a better 'brand' with a more upmarket feel and the other selling points I mentioned above to help differentiate myself. 

Is this enough or would this make the idea destined to fail.

ecommerce,Questions around start-up business,"Hi all,

No matter how much Googling I do, I cannot quite find the answers I am looking for so thought I'd ask some experienced people on this sub if that is okay?

So quick lowdown of my 'business plan' so far (it really isn't a professional plan, more of what I want to do) - to sell at competitive rates, not as wholesale but as retail.  (Not sure there is a huge difference).  Think of my business as a tiny (tinier than tiny) version of Argos - simply selling a small handful of different types of products, but with many specific products within the chosen categories.

I would be selling through all the available channels including:

-Company website
-Social media platforms
-Gumtree
-Shpock
-eBay

Looking to sell:

-Kids toys (Cuddly toys/Action figures/Building blocks/Interactive books/Interactive educational games/Cars)
-Board games
-Small gadgets (Gimmicky quirky adult products)
-Sweets and chocolate 
-Beauty products (Perfumes/Aftershaves/Body lotions. etc)

I chose the above as dispatching the products should not be too costly and can store them in my home.

What I want to know is what is the cheapest and easiest way to dispatch items? I assumed I would just post items off as and when and pay Royal Mail whatever the cost and add this cost in advance to the product I sell but is that necessarily the best and most productive idea?

Customers bought Product A and they received order confirmation for Product B Copy. The latter didnt even exist as a product...

After deleting and installing/synchronizing the plugin and reconnecting the the e-shop in mail chimp backend, again i managed to make it work but still some emails are never sent.

It is a mess we have a lot of sales every day and people dont receive their Invoices or receive them with wrong info.

I need another transactional email integration solution rahet than mailchimp. I was never happy with it delivering the emails very delayed anyway and now this.

ecommerce,How to use micro-influencers to spark sales in E-commerce,"It is important to remember that universal influencers do not exist and you need to find those in your niche by research and analysis.

The number of brand sponsored influencer posts is growing. In 2017, there were 14.5 million posts on Instagram. The volume of sponsored content is projected to amount to 32.3 million posts in 2019. [Statista]

In influencer marketing, you can go big with Selena Gomez, David Beckham, Shakira, or you can go small with industry experts, bloggers, and niche-market personalities.

Who to choose?

You should consider your goals before choosing collaboration with Macro or Micro Influencer

**Micro Influencers (1,000-999,999 followers)**

Pros: low budget, active followers, high engagement, trust

Cons: low to medium reach

The guys and gals at MarketingProfs prove that if you are looking for qualified leads and sales, you should choose Micro Influencers. As the number of followers increases, the number of likes decreases.

**Macro Influencers (1 million followers)**

Pros: high reach

Cons: low engagement, high cost, passive followers

A macro-influencer can reach a lot more people in a much more efficient way, but use them only for brand awareness.

**Start with your Buyer Persona**

You need to understand who are you reaching in order not to spend money on people followed by wrong followers. Here is a handy table which you can fill in with your information. As an example, I’ll use a clothing retail business.

Different types of influencers respond to different incentives, so think carefully about what influencers in your target market will prefer.

For example, Clothing industry influencers would like to receive money and special coupons they can share with their followers.

You need to pitch influencers and agree on conditions on your own. You also need to pay for them, and you don’t need those tools every single day. The only I’d recommend you is ninjaoutreach. If you’ve decided to use a software tool in your arsenal, let it be this one.

**How I search for influencers on Instagram for free:**

* Follow hashtags of your competitors to define who they pay for and how effective their budgets are spent.
* Check on posts and engagement under them.
* Contact them with taping on their profile and click on email.

**How To Work With Influencers**

* Sponsored Posts
* Product Reviews
* Gifts
* Competitions
* Affiliate Programs
* Guest Posts

ecommerce,e-Commerce // Instagram Startup,"So it's been 2 week since I launched an online store/community, and we're having some trouble closing the deal + getting views. Our feedback on our Instagram has been encouraging, as have the reviews of our customers so far (100% 5*'s).

However, we're not getting as much traffic as we would like, or converting the traffic we do get as well as we'd like. Any usability feedback would be amazing, as I come from a developer background and so sometimes find it hard to step away from it and see it as a consumer. Also in regards to getting the traffic in the first place, almost 100% of our traffic comes through our Instagram - is there anything we could change there to better convert our followers to web viewers?

ecommerce,Need help getting started with Facebook ads,"Hey guys ! I have an ecommerce store selling watches. I am trying to get started to launch Facebook ads  based on interest but I don’t feel I have enough knowledge to comfortably do so.  I have subscribed to Adam Reed’s fb ads course on udemy and it has a very good explanation on the overview of how to launch fb ads but there are still things puzzling me.

My main question is, how do you guys do interest audience split testing on fb ? I initially wanted to keep the campaign and ad sets the same, and only vary the interest. But how do I test the interest in a systematic manner ? For instance I initially wanted to do stack interest targeting so I wanted to target watch magazines AND watch brands, do I split test each individual watch magazine and brands separately ? So if I have 10 mag and 10 brands, that’s a total of 100 ads? That’s a bit of overkill considering initial budget to setup my fb campaign is 300 usd ( I hope it’s enough). I planned to use $5 daily for 7 days for each ad.

I’m still struggling with this step as I did not want to get started on the wrong foot and waste my money creating random ads. I know I should be collecting some good data at the beginning but I’m not sure if this is the right way. 

Appreciate your halp guys !",8,4,2018-02-16,ECOM,0.01903364434838295,0.9256857633590698,0.05528055876493454

shopify,What are some low-budget marketing strategies?,"Ok, so I just launched my shop yesterday and have quite a low budget... that means I've less than 400euro to get me through the semester and I'm paying for advertisement with some of that (I live with my parents and go to college, unable to get a job).

What I've been doing so far:

1. Created an instagram page and have started liking the posts of people that would be interested in my store. Also commenting on some posts explaining a bit about my shop. Have about 120 organic followers.

2. Created a facebook page last night and am spending 1euro a day on an ad (I know, it's nothing) but I've spent 45c so far and it's gotten me 10 likes and about 100 impressions. Also, yesterday I paid a number of people $1 to invite their friends to like the page. This has got me up to over 50 likes. Most of my shop views have been directed from facebook.

But other than that I'm kind of at a loss as to what cheap marketing strategies there are. I have plans for if it takes off to send instagram models etc. some samples, and to increase my facebook ads budget. But I need to make a sale or two this month or else I won't be able to afford to keep the shop open.

dropship,Why you should build your own Dropshipping Website,"Who is currently having the experience of running a drop shipping store with e-commerce builders like Shopify, and paying a recurring fee with no much profit on their business? 

When I first heard about dropshipping, Shopify was the easiest platform I could look into. But in the long run, it has proven to be costly. 

I believe when starting a business, you shouldn't pay more when you can actually pay less and even have more outstanding result with your little investment. 

Using the basic plan for Shopify will cost you $29/month and $348/year while creating a WordPress website with WooCommerce plugin will only cost less than $100. 

Don’t get me wrong Shopify is a beautiful platform. Actually, I believe there are into e-commerce business because of you. So they’ve got you covered with their awesome support and beautiful website. 

My point is, don’t go on spending much when you haven’t a detailed plan already. If you are familiar with WordPress you can easily build a website of your at low cost compared to other websites builders. 

More benefits of having your own dropshipping website:  

•	You get to spend less
•	Add unlimited product for no additional fee
•	Freedom to do whatever you like with your website. 
•	Access to various drop shipping plugins to supercharge your business 
•	WordPress is a free power-house capable of running all and any kinds of websites.

ecommerce,"E-commerce in Europe, man the regulations!","Hey guys, what's up, I'm new to this subreddit so... I'm Federico.

Anyway, to the juicy shit. I'm based in Germany and have been working on an eCommerce store for the past month or so, it'll be mainly focused on art prints and mid-value products. I'll first have it fulfilled by a POD service to test the market and then I'll move onto bulk ordering and shipping myself! But here I have a few questions that, really, confuse me more everytime I research them! I registered with the Rathaus for a Gewerbeanmeldung, but really they offer no help after that haha.

1. VAT. Oh man, the thresholds, Germany has a 100k one, should I not charge VAT at all until I reach the said threshold or the due thresholds to the countries I sell to? (I plan on selling EU-wide)

2. Sweet, sweet legalities. AGB, Widerrufsbelehrung, Datenschutz, Impressum. All that buzz is a must have for German businesses, but if my website is in English, do I have to have that or just T&amp;C? What if I have both languages? Oh boy, if there's somewhere I can read about this, please re-di-rect-me!

3. Communities? I know this is an eCommerce community, but I don't want to bug people here with Europe or Germany specific questions all the time... Does anyone know of an eCommerce-entrepreneur community of some sort somewhere where I can bug them instead? :D

And really, if anyone has experience selling online from Germany out, it'll probably make things really easy to answer, as that verbose way of explaining myself are really just a few simple questions that I need to get past, so... tl;dr:

1. When do I charge VAT?
2. What legal pages do I need in Europe?
3. European-centered eCommerce communities?

dropship,Jumping into the most saturated market,"Hey, so I learned about dropshipping late last year. I'd always known about Alibaba and Aliexpress but I always thought dropshipping was a sham until I found this forum. 3 weeks ago I decided to jump head first into it and chose the thing that seemed easiest to sell --- Women's clothing. My shopify store is over halfway complete. It was only until  a week ago after digging more did I find serious posts that warned against it and rightfully so. The market is so saturated and you still have to compete with ebay; where everyone exploits every item that can be dropshipped. 


This is honestly an experiment for me where I can burn $200 a month to see if I can make waves in this process so I'm okay with having losses for the next 6 months if its for the sake of actually developing the website and procedure. I kinda wonder if I can get a piece of that market. That means $1200 on this entire experience overtime.


Things I've done:


-Bought a domain very relevant to my niche and target market with no PPC advertisers referencing the term its based on even though it is a term that is growing more popular in the US and UK (recently mentioned on a very popular TV show).

-Got a Shopify account that I will eventually make a Woocommerce site instead (so much more flexiblity)

-Developed the site and added 100+ items. I avoided all of the “hot” items that are very easily found on Ebay.

-Added all of the add on basics that other stores seem to neglect (size charts, magnifiers, inch measurements, etc)



Things I'm planning to do to differentiate myself:


-90% of people use Oberlo and Aliexpress. Even though the items I currently have are from Aliexpress, The rest of the items I add are going to be from other Dropshipping sources and not just the popular ones.

-I have a mid tier dslr in my house that I just never had much a reason to use. I'm thinking I can spend $80 to make a decent studio background with lighting in my house. If I spend $300 or so to buy samples of what I'm selling, get 4 of my friends to do modeling for me (With their faces cropped out), and edit the photos, I think I can make a few high quality images so that people's brains don't immediately jump to “I think I saw that on ebay”.

-I have a page in the menu called “Under $X”, which is where I'm expecting to get a huge portion of sales. If I start to break even, I will buy some of the fastest moving items wholesale and ship them out from the US (that creates a nexus but I'm not too concerned yet). It will improve the return process. If I see any other items moving similarly, I will do the same.

-Use promotional tactics to differentiate myself from the competition and build customer loyalty. I have 2 in mind that seem very unique from what everyone including major players in the industry have never used. They're kinda weird in the sense that there's no proof in the market but consumer wise it makes sense to provide these tools to customers. I think these tactics will prove to be very essential for improving customer experience.

-Develop a real sales funnel instead of just regular influencers from Ig (though I intend to use influencers from Ig).

-work on/fiverr blogs about fashion a few times a month &gt;5 and learn/use seo marketing. 

-Handle customer service via email, have any returns sent to a PO box and eat any reasonable losses from returns.

I don't expect to be a millionaire overnight and I'm sure some of this will take much longer than expected, but it I can just break even relatively soon, I think it'd be worth the learning experience alone. I just started breaking out of my comfort zone and exploring amazon fba this year and I want to see what else I can do.  I know everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. How does all of this sound? Crazy or crazy enough to work? Any advice? Has anyone tried a plan like this?",10,10,2018-02-21,ECOM,0.038737982511520386,0.9235993027687073,0.03766278922557831

ecommerce,"First site, only hoping for a learning experience, a few questions about what the starting point looks like.","So far I have picked a niche, grabbed a domain/email, signed up for Shopify(dropshipping), formed an LLC, and am opening a business checking account in about a week (appt required). I do intend to keep at this either with my current store or a new one with different products. I plan on using the LLC just to keep things totally separate, make reporting more clear, etc..

On to the questions. The products I'm I planning on selling are in the $15 - $50 range. They often come in different colors. 

I'd like to get my own pictures of each product and have one of each model on hand to answer questions. As far as pictures go, do you know a way to get your own photos without buying one of each color? Having to do that would limit the number of products I could start with severely. 

Which brings me to how many products would you have to start? The niche I'm in has products with a similar ""uniqueness"" to shoes. If you go to a site with 10 different ""models"" of shoes it seems strange, no?  You should have more. Then each model has different colors. Am I just too hung up on the photos? It seems like an issue to have your supplier one Google image search away from anyone on your site, whether that's a customer or a competitor.

Another question, when it comes to adding filter tags, say you have 1000+ items on your store and you want to add a tag to filter by. Is there a way to handle this in Shopify besides manually going through and selecting them? Or any tools that use SQL or something similar?

ecommerce,A little advice on where to go next,"I run a clothes/accessories store with my gf, [urbanmoods.com](https://urbanmoods.com).

It's a dropshipping store, and we sell asian-inspired fashion and accessories. At the moment, we're only running ads for women's bags. Thought process is that I believe bags offer lower thresholds to buy than sized clothing for obivous reasons.

On the few ads we've run, we've had good relevance scores throughout (consistently around 8, with 2% CTR and 20-60 cent clicks), but few sales and not really from the people we thought would buy from us. I've used both single image and carousel ads, with the best relevance scores and CTR through carousel.

We ran a giveaway to harvest emails, and ended up with ~100 emails and two sales with about a 40% margin on said sales. Main goal was to use said emails for retargeting and creating lookalike audiences. The giveaway was optimized for traffic, and used interest targeting with 5-6 smaller handbag/accessories brands. In hindsight, I don't think we invested enough in the ad budget here, running it for ~3 weeks at $5/day. 

Just recently ended the giveaway campaign and not sure where to go from here. I feel like we went straight to the store without validating the niche first, which obviously is a bad thing, but at the same time received positive input on the brand and. I'm kind of torn between either:

* killing the store completely and starting over, doing more thorough niche research and trying to find a more specific niche. I'm thinking the clothes/accessories niche in general is way too saturated, even if we try to differentiate with asian inspired styles.

* pivoting the store, but keeping the logo and/or brand name. I'm not sure about this one either, as I don't know if our brand communicates properly what we try to sell, or if that's an issue at all. (the logo/brand is 100% self made and I'm not a professional; willing to hire someone to redo this if necessary)

Are we drawing conclusions too early? 

Would love some general advice on what to do next or what direction to take, and input on my thoughts. I don't have much invested in this other than couple hundred dollars I've spent on ads so far, so I'm willing to completely pivot and change things if necessary.",19,7,2018-02-22,ECOM,0.05457843467593193,0.9138118028640747,0.03160971775650978
ecommerce,Customer service is all that matters in a dropshipping business.,"We (the Reamaze.com team) recently had a chance to grab coffee with a group of Shopify, BigCommerce, and WooCommerce store owners and chat about how they got started in eCommerce. Among those that attended the event, roughly 30% got their start as a dropshipping business, learning the ropes from the best of the best, and forging their way to 5-digit monthly earnings. During our discourse, a recurring theme began to emerge — the fact that starting a dropshipped business in 2017/2018 is easier than ever before.

“I can’t find a reason why people shouldn’t give eCommerce entrepreneurship a try. With all the technology out there, it costs no money to get started and it couldn’t be any simpler. You literally have nothing to lose. And I’m surprised more people don’t use this to their benefit.” — Irwin Dominguez via Oberlo

Inventories are more abundant, vendors have better logistics, fulfillment technologies are more mature, pricing is more competitive (a double-edged sword), and customer communications are more streamlined. And that got us thinking, given that a dropshipped business already have a lot of traditional responsibilities removed from the equation (little to no capital, low overhead, flexible location, product variation, and the list goes on), what can store owners control to set themselves apart from the pack? The answer? Customer service.

Reputation is important for any successful eCommerce brand. To a dropshipped eCommerce business, customer satisfaction is the foundation of reputation building. It’s also the most crucial factor in growing and sustaining a viable dropshipping business. The shopping and support experience you offer customers is something you have utter control over even when you don’t have control over inventory and fulfillment. Since the burden of work is reduced, the more time you spend with customers, the more successes you’ll find. It’s time to treat customer service as a core asset to your survival. Here are some things to think about for your dropshipping business when it comes to customer service.

Coming to terms with your logistics

When you manage your own inventories including purchasing, organizing, packaging, and delivery, you control every step of the customer experience. You can make sure customers get a good experience because you’ve anticipated what might go wrong and put in the necessary stop-measures. Even if something is about to go out of stock, you can order more ahead of time. Simple logistics such as this make creating customer satisfaction easier over time.

It’s an entirely different story when you’re a dropshipped business, however. You sacrifice control over some of the most intimate steps of creating a positive customer experience. A small lapse in communication with your inventory provider or a poorly packaged item can send your entire operation into chaos. Imagine if:

- Your dropshipper is on holiday when you’re not or vice versa
- They packaged the product in an ill-fitting box
- They used the wrong delivery provider and the order is delayed
- They sent the wrong product
- They ran out of a specific product and didn’t notify you in time
- Etc.

Whatever the issue, you take on the negative customer feedback. Not them. While all of this can be somewhat mitigated by picking a wholesale dropshipper partner that is reliable, it’s also inevitable that something will go wrong. They don’t lose you as a customer because of one mucked up order but you might lose a customer because of a small hiccup.

So, if there’s one thing you can do about logistics is to think up of all the ways things can go wrong ahead of time and prepare your customer service team to respond effectively and efficiently.

Go through your services as a customer

The second thing you should do test drive your offerings from start to end before opening up shop. This is not only a test for your customer service team (perhaps just yourself) and also a test for your dropshipping suppliers. Take notes and see how you hold up under scrutiny. Be tough on yourself so customers can have a better experience in the long run.

- How was the browsing experience?
- How quick was your customer service team to reply to inquiries?
- How was the purchasing experience? Any issues with the transaction?
- Have you reviewed your refund, exchange, and shipping policies? How’s the copy?
- Now as for your dropshipping supplier, give them a test as well and pay attention to:
- Was the item’s stock status reflected properly?
- Did you get a tracking number in a timely manner?
- Did you receive your order in a timely manner?
- Was the packaging up to par? Does it pass your scrutiny test? Did proper branding or free gifts get included?
- Was the product received in good condition?
- Were you able to reach someone at the dropshipping supplier on a timely manner? How helpful were they?

Never leave things in autopilot. Always stay one step ahead of your customers.

So much of providing great customer service is being good at anticipating problems, being a detail oriented team, understanding customer behavior, being proactive with customers and engaging them before they engage you, and finally, using real world numbers to shape your decision making process.

For example, you should be your customers’ advocate when an order that should have shipped hasn’t been shipped promptly. Reach out to your supplier and inquire on behalf of the customer. If you want to take it one step further, you can even reach out to the customer and let them be aware of the delay. Instill trust and put a face to your business whenever and wherever you can.

“People don’t trust pages or websites. They trust people. So it’s crucial that your website has a human factor. One way or another, you want to present your prospective customers with faces and names” — Susan Hayes, Shopify

You and your team need to be proactive in resolving potential customer service problems even if the customer hasn’t complained yet. Keep in mind that customers often don’t complain and just issue a chargeback. Having limited access or resources or control in certain aspects of a business can be tough but being proactive will always help save the day.

Being proactive also means paying attention to what your suppliers are doing. Track the inventory levels to make sure your most popular products aren’t going out of stock. If you can stay ahead of the curve, you can even proactively modify your eCommerce platform settings to always remove a product automatically once a stock threshold is reached. In summary, it’s important to always be wary of customer service issues as a result of your inability to control certain aspects of your business. Being extra careful will ensure you don’t have customers ordering products or experiencing delays that wasn’t your fault to begin with.

Always leverage reviews to communicate great customer service

Having great customer service is one thing. Communicating that fact to your prospective shoppers is a whole other thing. As many said during our sit-down, a positive review is worth a thousand words. Having a customer service team and process that has a habit of requesting for reviews and showing off those reviews is one of the most important elements of building a successful dropshipping business. Remember, great customer service is is both reactive and proactive. If you’ve got people saying positive things about you, show it off! Got into the news? Display that in all of its glory right on your homepage.

Signing Off

Starting a dropshipping business is just that, starting. With all the advantages of being a dropshipped business, there are real world risks and real strategies you need to employ in order to be successful. Customer service is not often the most talked about aspect of running a business but being great at managing customer expectations can help you satisfy customer demands even when you’re not 100% in control.",1,5,2018-02-22,ECOM,0.09355293586850166,0.8743147850036621,0.03213229775428772

If I put a credit card processor on my website and I get an order and it passes all of the authentication checks, what is stopping the end-user who is a complete stranger to me and my company from implementing a chargeback? This happened to me with a $1,100 item a while back. His billing matched shipping, gave a CVV, and I even required a signature upon receiving the package, however, I still lost the chargeback to the bank even with a mountain of evidence showing that he received the package.

So my question is: if everything associated with a sale looks right to you, how do you become 99% sure that the customer will not implement a chargeback, and if the dreaded day comes that a customer does implement a chargeback, how do you as 
a dropshipper effectively present your evidence to a bank as to win the dispute? This could just be me, but I feel like banks view dropshipping operations as illegitimate and will always side with the consumer even if a dropshipper does provide all evidence to the contrary.",2,3,2018-02-22,ECOM,0.05314629524946213,0.9171780943870544,0.02967563085258007

ecommerce,Anyone using shipping insurance company? Are you happy? How much is it?,"Hey everyone


My products are kinda expensive as you may know from my posts. I had a few instances and UPS authorization has been a hassle for the consumer. So there were a few cases where the UPS driver stopped by the customer's house to check out the badly damaged box which we had already uploaded the pictures of, but the customer was not at home so the case got cancelled. I'm paying about $3 per item for shipping insurance. Only had to start claim like 4 5 times out of hundreds of shipments. So we decided to not insure it. But I'm not necessarily feeling good about not having shipping insurance.

Is there any outside shipping insurance company that insures UPS, Fedex and LTL shipments that you use? How much is it on average per shipment, per $100? Are you happy with the claims process?

shopify,Thinking about using Shopify as a Primarily Blogging Platform. Am I Crazy?,"I'm thinking about using Shopify as Primarily a blogging platform. Am I crazy?

For a blog obviously Wordpress is typically the first go to option. For less tech saavy people or people looking for a cheaper/easier/faster option obviously sacrificing some options, quality, and potentially Google ranking you have Squarespace, Weebly and Blogger.

Curious to hear others thoughts on this? Is this a stupid idea?

My thinking is this. Shopify has plenty of apps for e-mail collection and anything else I would possibly need. The blogging platform while typically not the focus seems to have everything I need. I can control the metadata, custom urls, upload media ie videos and photos. I don't really get into a lot of charts and stuff so not really needing advanced blogging features. 

Curious if that would be a less superior options in terms of SEO or any other potential downsides I'm missing. The idea behind the site would be more a personal site/blog primarily, but may in the future sell some Merch, I feature Entrepreneurs business stories so I thought maybe down the road I may incorporate selling other peoples products ie people featured in the blog through the site as well, however at this point and probably moving forward blogging would be the primary focus.

ecommerce,Seeking Recommendations of E-commerce Software for Cross-Marketplace Listings and Management,"Hi guys, I hope you are all doing well today. I’m looking for some guidance in setting up a system to better sell and ship thousands of on-hand inventory items online through my own website *and* through various commerce marketplaces in a smooth and seamless way.

My goal is to find an easy-to-use CMS and associated plugins for listing products, with the ability to include items listed locally, on third party website such as eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, Etsy, and others. I want to have my own website listing these products (to build a brand) but also reach multiple high-volume marketplaces for exposure.

*Please jump to the TLDR for cliffs on what I'm looking for*

**Desired Functionality**

I’d like the software to allow me to create one listing with photos, item description, pricing options, item specs, and shipping options, and also provide permissions to list the products on third party websites, ideally multiple products and multiple third-party sites simultaneously. 

Alternatively, a more basic (and time consuming) system of software tools could provide the ability to import (and potentially exporting) product meta data to make it simple to list a product on multiple websites, but just done manually instead of automatically. One could batch list items, 20, 50, 100+ at a time. For example, one would create a standardize CSV or spreadsheet with key criteria and description, and use this software tool to import listings to eBay, Craigslist, and other marketplaces. This is less ideal than what I described above, but I could live with it.

Ideally, this software would have a system to either prevent listings on competition commerce platforms, or better yet, a system that would automatically delist an item on Amazon, for example, if an eBay reserve or buy-it-now price is met (prices are automatically changed to reflect current bids/stock cross-platform). This is to prevent duplicate purchase orders without enough inventory.

**TLDR of What I’m Looking For**

A software system with the ability to 1) easily list or import groups of products to multiple commerce marketplaces, 2) manage/sync dual listings across platforms, 3) simply and accurately track inventory, 4) simply track product shipping status (what has shipped, been delivered, and is ready to ship), and 5) product costs and basic accounting tools like net/gross sales, costs by shipping/platform fees, items sold, income over time, etc.

**What I’m Looking At Right Now**

Right now I’m in the process of choosing a domain name, then playing around with WooCommerce. 

Correct me if I’m wrong, but my best options seem to be either WooCommerce or Shopify. In my experience Shopify is more restrictive and I’m unsure if it offers the tools to meet my needs outlined in the TLDR. WooCommerce I’m even less familiar with but know it’s the standard and has many, many add-on options. Also open to other solutions.

**Advance/Recommendations Needed**

I make this post because I’m seeking guidance on what system to use, and if I go with something like WooCommerce, what plugins I need. Is what I described easy? I’m only lightly familiar with WooCommerce and Shopify (briefly used both in the past), and I know there are a lot of options with Woo. What software/plugins do you recommend? Free options are preferred, but I’m willing to spend a small investment if it increases my work flow and ability to generate sales (we’re talking 100,000s of items, potentially).

ecommerce,"My thoughts (and tips?) after growing an AliExpress/Oberlo dropshipping store from $0 - $1,000,000 in less than 6 months (long-ass post)","Hopefully the title of my post isn't too sensational.

Anyway, I have a bit of time to kill (currently waiting for my designers to finish up some stuff for me for my new store's launch), so I thought I'd post here just to give you guys some insight into the dropshipping world from my perspective.

Keep in mind, I'm still considered somewhat of a noobie since $1-million really isn't that much (my net profit was around 25%), so yeah. I'm not gonna act like I'm some omniscient business mogul... but... I do have some real and ""in-the-trenches"" insights that will hopefully help some of you on your journey, regardless of if you're in the dropshipping space or not.

To start off, the BIG question:

#**Is dropshipping (AliExpress/Oberlo) worth it?**

Yes and no.

I say no because there really isn't much room for growth. As much as I'd love to tell you guys shipping times don't matter... well, they really do. And dropshipping from China just takes way too long. Obviously, you can find suppliers who have warehouses in the US, but most don't, and most of the time you'll be dealing with 2 - 4 weeks shipping time.

There's also people who'll tell you, ""If you give them a good enough deal, then they'll wait!"". Yeah, they will, but they most likely won't ever buy from you again.

And that's the biggest drawback in all of this. You rarely get any repeat sales... and that's sorta where all the money is.

Advertising gets more expensive over time. As you hit more of your target market, you start getting in front of less qualified prospects and you end up having to spend more to convert. This is just how it is in any industry (I was a marketing consultant before I jumped into eCommerce).

And because advertising gets more expensive, eventually, your ads won't really be profitable upfront anymore. And this is perfectly fine for most businesses since once they do get a customer (even at a loss), they can make it up in the back end. But you can't really do that with a dropshipping business (using this AliExpress model) for the most part. 

There are exceptions, of course, but let's be real, most dropshipping businesses of this nature don't get much repeat buyers.

Because of this, you have to rely on constantly finding a new product to push and try to get into new markets over and over again. It's always an uphill battle and you won't ever really have an asset (aka customer base) you can cultivate to maximize your profit potential.

Besides that, there's also the issue with quality control, extreme amounts of competition, unreliable suppliers, and just a whole host of issues that you'll constantly run into. 

It's just a lot of headaches and not really fulfilling.

HOWEVER, despite all this, dropshipping is still worth it. Why? Because it's a great learning experience. I've learned so much over these past few months that I now have an almost arrogant-like confidence for any venture I start. 

Once you get a taste of blood (like making $7k in profit a day at times), then there's just no more doubt in your mind, and you'll be able to make money much easier (since there's no barrier of doubt stopping you).

On top of this, dropshipping is a great way to learn which markets are HOT. I ran a general store and tested a buncha different markets and finally settled on one that brought in really good money for me. I'm now expanding to a full-on business in this market that no longer relies on Chinese dropshipping. And I wouldn't have even thought to target this market if it weren't for me testing with my dropshipping business.

So, in short, although Chinese dropshipping is horrible in the long run, it's definitely worth pursuing with the intent to LEARN and find hot markets to start real businesses in.

#**What's the most important thing that contributed to your semi-success?**

I get messages from people time to time asking me for general tips and how to succeed in dropshipping, but I have a tip that I think will honestly help anyone regardless of what industry they're in, what fulfillment method they use, or what product they sell.

Here's my MILLION DOLLAR secret: Test.

That's it.

TEST. 

Even though I've made decent money these past few months, if you were to come to me and ask me if product A would do better than product B, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you. If you asked me if interest A would work better than interest B for the product you want to test on Facebook, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you. If you asked me which price point would work better for your product, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you.

I'm not a psychic and I don't have magical powers of foresight.

What I do have, though, is a mind that's capable of analyzing data. And, fortunately for me (and you), that's really all you need to be able to succeed in business. 

If you can analyze data, if you can tell which number is bigger or smaller than another number, if you can do simple math like multiplication/division/addition/subtraction, then you can succeed. 

Because at the end of the day, all you really gotta do is test your ideas, concepts, products, copy, ads, etc... analyze the data... then go back and make the necessary corrections (kill or scale). 

My strategy for finding winning products, markets, ads, or whatever, is by running a shit ton of ads (at a low price), then seeing which ones get the best results. That's it.

I run probably anywhere from 20 - 100 ads to test a new product. And from there, I get about like 2 - 5 ads that do well. Sometimes they do REALLY well. And in rare occasions, I get a few that make me a killing.

It's weird because the idea of testing is so simple. Everyone already knows what it is. They've heard about it from gurus or they just subconsciously know that testing is the logical thing to do. But people forget. They get too caught up in the day-to-day activities of their business and forget to set aside time to set up methodical tests. But trust me, testing is the most important thing I've ever done, and it's the reason I've achieved this amount of semi-success.

Testing is like my magic bullet. I know I'm going to succeed because I know how important testing is. When you think about it, life in general kinda runs on feedback loops. And that's really what testing is. Similar to how as a kid you made little corrections so you wouldn't fall off a bike, you gotta make those corrections within your business and keep doing what works (and scale it), and stop doing what doesn't work.

#**Okay, since you made the point that testing is important, what's the next most important thing?**

Actually, I wouldn't say this is secondary in importance to testing, but there's something that's AS important as testing... and that is: 

Branding (or, in other words, a unique selling proposition).

Branding is so crucial in today's business world that if you don't have some sort of branding, some sort of consistency throughout your business, then you won't make it (in the long run).

Branding isn't just about getting a logo made and slapping it everywhere. It's about taking a unique stance (whether it's combining 2 old elements together to make it new, stripping an element from something to make it simpler, improving upon something, or just coming up with a new thing altogether), and then putting that at the forefront of everything you do.

It's hard to explain the importance of branding to the uninitiated or the people who've just gotten their feet wet in eCommece and business in general, but branding needs to encompass everything you do. From the theme / types of products you sell, to your customer service, and even to the look and feel of your website.

And I'm not saying you need to run a buncha ads on branding like what the mega corporations do. But just have some sort of message that you stand behind that you emphasize in everything you do (your advertising, your follow up emails, your communications, your website copy, etc.)

It'll make you stand out from the competition and give your customers a compelling reason to buy from you.

This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I see when people ask me to critique their stores. They have a random eCommerce site with just a buncha random products thrown up on it (usually watches lol), but there's like... no message there. There's no compelling reason to buy from them (since most of the time it's a generic product you can find for cheaper and better quality elsewhere).

But branding also needs to customer-centric. It needs to be a message that resonates with the customer and gives them a benefit, gives them identity, gives them a sort of feeling of belonging... or just whatever. It's gotta be focused around the CUSTOMER. A branding message that says ""I started this store because I'm a college student who wants money to travel the world"" isn't strong enough. A branding message that says ""We can offer our watches at a cheaper price because we cut out the middleman and go direct to the manufacturer"" is not a compelling message. 

It needs to be something with more oomph. The best way to learn how to come up with a good brand and brand message is by... well... looking at other businesses that have a strong USP / brand message. Warby Parker. Apple. Toms. Supreme. Dominoes. Mcdonalds. Avis (their old slogan). Dollar Shave Club. Purple. There's so many businesses out there with powerful messages that you can use to learn and then create your own USP (obviously, you can't copy these because they're unique, but you can study and deconstruct to learn WHY they're so compelling and powerful).

#**That's all, folks**

I kinda started this post off thinking I would get deep into some of my strategies and tactics, but for the most part it seems like I just gave out general tips that you've probably read or heard elsewhere a million times. But at least I can somewhat confirm that it's legit and actually works, so there's that. 

Anyway, think I've spent too much time writing this so I'm probably gonna log off now and watch some YouTube or something. 

Feel free to hit me with any questions (if you have any) regarding your business and I'll see if I can give you any specialized tips. (But, like I mentioned earlier, I probably won't know the answer to your question... so you should test it hehe.)

Thanks for bearing with me and reading through all of this!

If you skipped to the bottom, then... here's a TLDR for you:

#**TL;DR**

1. Dropshipping (using the AliExpress/Oberlo model) is great for learning and finding hot markets to start real businesses in, but there isn't much longevity.
2. My MILLION DOLLAR secret: Test everything. Scale what works, kill what doesn't.
3. Your branding / unique selling proposition will make or break your business. Find a USP / branding message that resonates with your customers but also makes you stand out from the competition.

Summary: This is all basic shit you've read before but I felt like typing something so I made this post... so yeah.",62,60,2018-02-25,ECOM,0.04202278393010298,0.9200679063796997,0.03790925939877828
ecommerce,First Sale!!! Hearts Pounding!,"So my dad talked to me two weeks ago and told me ""Hey bud, we should really look into drop shipping and see how doable it is."" He has been really big into Youtube videos lately and starting watching a young kid by the name of Hayden Bowles. So a week later I sit down and watch a few videos and I start getting into it. I like his videos and I think he has some good advice so I go along with it and start getting my hands dirty.

Fast forward to today, having just launched the website and even hit some snags along the way (apparently facebook needs to verify my business page or something so I can't even start running ads yet) but despite not being able to start paid advertising we reached 60 views in 3 hours and had two orders so far just from leveraging facebook sharing between family and friends!

dropship,First Try At This,"Was interested in dropshipping so I decided to give it a try. It has been about a month  and I’ve gotten 4 sales but my conversation rate is really low. My only source of audience is from advertising on Instagram Influencer pages based around dogs. 

Just wondering if it’s something about my store that is turning people away or if I’m not properly advertising or what the problem is. I’ve had around 300 visitors in the last month with only 4 purchases and 5 abounded carts,  My ads are usually based around one free + shipping item which is currently the charm bracelet.  

What other ways can I draw traffic? 
How can I improve my conversion rate? 
Is there any free or cheap apps you can suggest? 

I’m using Shopify with a common theme but I tried my best to make it my own. Currently using aliexpress but am looking for a manufacturer to become a dealer with, could this improve my sales rate?

2. Same as above except quote doesn't mention team name.
3. Just a drawing of an athlete.
4. Just a quote from an athlete.

ecommerce,"New soon-to-be entrepreneur, ecommerce help/advice","Hello!

I want to start an e-commerce website for an Asian target market.

I have found a provider for most of what I think I need, but they are almost all separate solutions from one another! Is there an all-in-one that I don't know about? Or is this normal?

These are the features that I believe I need:

- Accessibility/visibility to Chinese consumers

- Website: wucommerce or Shopify seem good

- Language drop-down or auto-translate

- Terms/conditions (easy enough to get through an e-commerce host)

- Appointment calendar with auto-booking, repeats, and email receipts/reminders (Square seems pretty good!)

- Paypal/credit card processing: want not processed on my server

- VPN (get around firewall)

- Business email

- App

- hosting in China to prevent even slower connection

I thought Google would be good for a business email address, but then I learned Google is banned in China :(
I have not been able to find a complete package solution, but I'm sure I just don't know what to look for.

Does anybody have experience, or an idea for how to go about this?

Thank you :)

I have been working on improving email deliverability for almost 4 years now.

I’m starting to develop the first beta versions of a platform where you can send a test of your email campaign and this platform will provide all the potential deliverability issues that you may have (Domain DNS errors, Email services policy complains, email services good practices, blacklist check, cold IP check, html errors, UI check on different type of devices, etc, etc).

I know there are some expensive services providing this as a feature. My idea is to focus on deliverability for a affordable price. 

The way I see it is that in today’s online marketing standards reaching the inbox is almost as important as having a good rank in search engines results.

This requires constant efforts and to be constantly up to date with the different changes in policies and requirements from email providers among many other things.

The absolute goal of this service is to provide to the users total pease of mind that your campaign email is doing as well as possible based in always updated standards in a simple and reliable way.

And if your email has deliverability issues to provide you and actionable report on how to solve the detected issues.

What do you think guys? 
Can you see yourselves as users of this service?
