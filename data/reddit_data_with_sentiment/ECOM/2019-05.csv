dropship,how I faked being a guru for 6 months,"Disclaimer: The first thing I want to say is that I did not profit from being a guru. I did not have a course for sale, all the mentoring I did was free, and I never used an affiliate link.

**How it started:** I started my first dropshipping store in 2017, it was called phoneaccessoriesplus.com (doesn't exist anymore). The store was a complete disaster, and I was done with dropshipping until September of 2018, when I found reddit. I began to join tons of entrepreneurship discords including[ r/dropship](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship). As I was casually scrolling through reddit I saw an advertisement for a, ""DROPSHIPPING DISCORD SERVER"" and I joined the server, titled “ECOM Masters.” I was one of the first to join the server. I quickly became one of the most active people on the server and then I became one of current mentors (or “gurus”) dm’d me asking if I would want to become a mentor, I happily obliged and *bam*. just like that, I was a mentor of a small Dropshipping server with &lt;200 members. Although there was a vetting process, basically all he required of me was proof that I had run a store, so I showed him the Instagram account created for phoneaccesoriesplus.com. I showed him an Instagram with less than 200 likes in total to gain my spot as a mentor.

**My Role in the server:** I spent up to 30 hours a week helping newbies, giving common sense advice, and designing Shopify stores in exchange for little or no pay at all. I also helped do basic admin/moderator roles, but not much else other than that. People would often (successfully) invest substantial capital off of the advice I gave, that was more calculated guesswork and conjecture than anything.

**How I got caught:** so 4 weeks ago I started a legitimate web development startup consisting of a programmer (one of the other mentors), 2 marketers (basically virtual assistants ), and 2 other guys who would do general work. So I had our very first client walk out on us at the last minute, which left me \~$1k USD in debt, so I had trouble paying the programmer (mentor) his pay and this was quickly escalated into the discord server. The owner of the server got suspicious of how I couldn't pay the other mentor. He vetted me again. He began to find all the holes in my story and quickly told the whole server I was a fake. (I worked out the issues I had with the mentor I worked with and did not scam him.)

**What I learned:** *ALL GURU's* in the dropshipping community are fakes. ALL the gurus I encountered throughout the 6 months of my own fraud often had never even opened a store, let alone made sales. This included all the gurus in the server I was in. Which, of course, includes the owner of the server. I realized that dropshipping is a hell of a lot harder than it seems on the surface. I found that actual product-in-hand stores are the stores that are truly successful in e-commerce.

**Why I did all this:** I really enjoyed working with the community and I helped 100's of people improve their stores for literally no cost. I hoped to make fast cash at first, as most dropshippers do, but I realized I was better at tweaking working models than building my own.",14,15,2019-05-02,ECOM,0.09433189779520035,0.8801615834236145,0.025506528094410896

ecommerce,Anybody using godaddy for their website or online store?,"In setting up my store I have tried out a few different recommend platforms. Abantecart, shopify, and godaddy. 

I was originally using a self hosted website and had started using Abantecart to set up a store. My problem there was that it would have taken more time and effort to try to edit the site to match the site I had already designed. The option to edit werent user friendly, even looking through the guide.

The depth of the platform itself is great as far as inventory, analytics, etc.

Next was shopify. First I went with the shopify lite plan, which was Ok for what I was getting for the price. I could just add an extra page to my site, and add the products and services, then embed the code into my site. I (accidentally) upgraded to the basic shopify plan and decided to try it out anyway. Still good as far as depth of features, analytics, generators for privacy policies, plus plenty of plugins and apps to add functionality. As far as the online store, again it took more effort to get the styling to match that if the main site.

Next I came across Godaddy's website and ecommerce services and I've been giving this a try. The main thing that I like is that everything is uniform across the site itself and the store. Adding products and editing the site is simple enough. Though it doesnt have the depth in terms of analytics and content generators that shopify and Abantecard have. 

With that beunbsaid, I may transition to a full godaddy subscription.

Im having a go at my third store, really wanted to make a go at this one. Got some advice, all be it maybe not that great as its turning out on a niche and product, and using what I've learned from mucking around with the first two. 

Im running ads on facebook at $30 (AUD) spend per day, quite targeted, about 2 million people. They are getting good impressions and link clicks, but. Im getting cold feet, due to no sales. Its been 4 days and 117 unique visitors, and I keep seeing people with these staggering numbers of sales on their first day or week and cant help but feeling im missing something crucial to the whole formula. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I back the ad spend down to let them keep 'learning' ? Should I ditch the product and start again, again? (beauty niche ultrasound massager) Completely rework my website maybe? Im starting to feel maybe its a bit too obviously a dropshipping site? But how many of the target audience out there is even aware of dropshipping. 

At great fear of being ripped apart this is my store:  [https://ultrasound-massager.com/](https://ultrasound-massager.com/)

I'm assuming that the value of the card is determined, then it is converted into cash somehow, then Card-O-Matic takes a bite of the cash and gives the rest to the seller.

What is bothering me is, how is the initial cash conversion done? Does the issuer (e.g. Applebee's ) buy back the card from Card-O-Matic?

dropship,Daily Dropshipping Tip of the Day #4 - less is more,"So something I have noticed lately that is working very well for me with regards to FB advertising. 

**super broad audiences**   


Let's say you're advertising a generic product that applies to almost everyone, like this [drain cleaner](https://www.productmafia.com/product/all-purpose-quick-foaming-toilet-cleaner/), pretty much everyone over the age of 26 has moved out from their parents house, and has at some point, had drainage issues. So this is a perfect example of when NOT to try and get smart with the targeting.   


Try targeting: All genders, worldwide, no custom audiences, no exclusions, no interests nothing. Mega-broad, ages 26+  


*It seems counter intuitive, but it works!*   


It has been working for me for at least the last 3 months or so. In the past, if you did this, it would give you loads of junk traffic from pakistan, philippines, india, africa etc... but now, the altoryth seems to actually be doing its job, and separating the buyers from the non-buyers. Even with worldwide targeting, I am getting decent quality traffic. Soon as you start adding exclusion etc, the algorithm doesn't like it and results seem to dip.   


It works for me, but it might not work for everyone, but it's something to test out for sure when you are testing your next product.

shopify,"Lots of impressions, no sales","Hello shopify redditors!

Our Canadian shopify website has been active for a few months, and we have about 500 impressions from 31 different counties: mainly Canada and USA. All of our shipped online sales have come from USA. 

Our site: www.kindercastle.ca
We are a Newfoundland-owned company, and we source children's toys and party supplies (not on the site yet)  in a wide range of styles, prices, and themes and sell them in our brick and mortar store. We opened our website last year with the hope of increasing traffic to our physical store and reaching a market of people who cannot get to our physical store. While we dont have every item in our store online, we are slowly working to resolve this. We are slowly gaining traction with both the online and the physical store, but we want to catch any mistakes early so that we can continue to enjoy upward growth. 

Analyzing our site:
From comparing our site to others, I can see that our items are not categorized and the site is showing sold-out items. *how do I automatically hide sold out items?* and *how do I sort based on categories?*

Marketing:
*how can we market our site so that we can get more traffic and convert impressions to sales*

Local market:
From what I can gather, there doesn't seem to be many other toy-based stores in our province, and we are the only niche toy store in our city. Theres no box toy stores within a 7 hour drive, no other dedicated children's toy stores on the island either. We do have box stores that carry toy lines, but no other dedicated toy store. We know the market is looking for things we carry, but we're still having difficulty finding our market and working within that market to justify this business. 

What can we do to increase traffic and sales? What products would you like to see? How would you expect a toy site to look? What discounts or promotions could we offer to increase interest?

dropship,Please check out our store! Finally open after a long journey.,"Long read so Ill post this here first.  www.joagear.com

Hello everyone.  A year and a half ago, I decided to expand on my consulting business by starting an ecommerce store.  Obviously, Shopify stood out and planned for the next year or so.  Lots of reading, tutorials, do's and don'ts.  Even more tries just to avoid the get-rich-quick schemes and ""gurus"".  Spent even more time after that making meaningful connections with our local scene and setting up social media.  

Started building from scratch in January.  As of yesterday, we are open!  I am not a pro site builder so please take our work with a grain of salt.  But I did want to know what you guys thought of the site.  Ultimately, I just want to make it better so if you see something you think should be changed, please let me know. 
 Because we are selling items that are defensive in nature, advertising on Insta and FB has been a challenge and we are still working on our first ad.  A lot more going on with local craftsmen as well as the dropshipped products.  Made our first 6 sales through friends but hope to get a few randoms soon!  Thanks again!

I've seen shopify and others as options but don't think i'll be doing enough to have the monthly fees be worth it. Any ideas?

ecommerce,PIVOT - Change Is Inevitable [My Story],"# PIVOT - Change Is Inevitable

**Very few people like CHANGE**, but it's inevitable.  I want to take a moment and encourage all of you  to keep working hard, keep listening, learning, and evaluating trends.   Be prepared to encounter change and embrace it.   We have always heard people talk about the need for ""multiple streams of income"" and it's so very important.  

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past 2 years, I've been in the biggest pivot of my e-commerce career.   I went from a massive dropship operation with over 500,000 active SKU averaging over $10 million/year in sales (as a part-time owner, btw!) to downsizing, rebooting with about 1-2 dozen SKU, private label, and wholesale FBA.

&amp;#x200B;

I was blessed to be able to do all of this part-time because I had a full-time job as a music minister that I'd done for over 25+ years.   That season came to an end, and I had a very generous church salary/benefits package that I had to replace, and quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be 49 years old this year.   I've realized that I'm in that season where it's as much as passing my knowledge on to others as it is utilizing it for my own sales.   I love to teach, coach, and lead others so I've been pursuing e-commerce consulting and brand management.   In just a few months I've signed agreements with companies who have amazing products to sell but had no solid e-commerce strategy.   Now they are beginning to flourish - and the sky is the limit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the most expensive season of my life.  Four teenage kids.   One leaving in a couple of months for college.   The other three right behind.   3 student drivers.   2 in braces, another about to get them.  Teenage boys who can eat more groceries than you can stock on your shelves.   Not the time you want to lose your main job.   

**When change comes, you can sit on the curb, suck your thumb, and blame everyone.  Or you can pick your head up and work.   Adapt.   Modify.   PIVOT.**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm encouraged because I'm seeing progress in multiple streams of income:  


* Sales from my private label brands (3 separate PL brands across 3 completely different categories).
* Sales from wholesale purchases, mostly sent to FBA and/or FBA and my other 3PL (for Walmart/eBay/Shopify orders)
* Monthly consulting retainer revenue from my brand management/consulting clients (which is based on a gross % commission of sales, but with a monthly minimum)
* and outside of e-commerce, still being blessed with revenue from my main passion, which is music - artist royalties, publishing royalties, and performance revenue from playing piano gigs 1-2 nights per week.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to encourage you to not put all your eggs in one basket.   I want to encourage you to not get too comfortable.   If you think you can put your business on auto-pilot and take a nap, I've got news for you - you're going to wakeup to an alarm saying ""pull up, pull up"".  

&amp;#x200B;

shopify,Shopify App Development - Shared Learnings &amp; Feedback,"Hi /r/Shopify!

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to put together a really quick guide to my experience with app development on the Shopify Partners program. There are some awesome blogs out there but I wanted to share my personal experience.

**Timelines**

Submitted: April 23rd

Rejected For Tweaks: May 1st

Resubmitted: May 2nd

Minor Updates Required by Shopify: May 8th

Published: May 10th

&amp;#x200B;

**Total Time From Submit to Approval: 17 days**

Note: On May 8th, I was given a direct email line to the QA team as the updates required were minor. Hence the timeline got shortened. I also pushed my changes fast (Less than 1 day)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Top Learnings**

* As soon as your App loads, you must show how to install and configure the App. I went the video route here but it was not enough. You must also include written instructions. ANY documentation or FAQ must live INSIDE the App. I made the mistake of having it on my own personal site and linking it, this is not permitted.
* You need a support centre in your App. This can be as simple as a contact form but it must be in the App.
* You need clear privacy policy links in the App.
* I missed this, but you need to select the option that states the merchant must have the online store sales channel in section F when you submit your App.

**General Remarks**

* Take the time to produce a clear promo and install video. Likewise, take the time to put together a strong page for your app listing.
* Take the time to research the market. Don't develop Apps that already exist, either build a better App or take a fresh approach. Many categories are crowded.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Issues &amp; Fixes**

The following comes directly from the review feedback from Shopify and may assist you:

*Your onboarding process needs improvement so it is clearer to merchants of all experience levels. Refer to our post for suggestions on how to improve your onboarding. After installing your application I'm not directed on what to do next or how to set up the application as you can see in this screencast.*

My Fix: I added a clear video and links to a knowledge base page in the App itself.

*Detailed instructions on how to install and setup your app must be included within your app’s user interface. The ability for merchants to make any required changes for your app to function must be available after installation.* 

My Fix: As above.

*Please include a support centre within the user interface of the app. This could include easily accessible documentation, contact form, support credentials, and/or an FAQ section.*

My Fix: I added a simple page with a contact form that sends me an email when the user opened a ticket.

To date I have been posting on social media and special interest groups, which costs nothing but my time. I want to stay away from generating “noise” and becoming monotonous within these groups, and it’s time to reach out to more audiences or engage in different ways. 

What methods have you used to target potential customers within your market?

Is the standard gamut of Facebook / Google Ads targeted enough to bring in the right audiences? 

With $0 spent on advertising so far I hesitate to make the leap into paid ads that may fall flat. 

Any input appreciated!!

ecommerce,Image Size for Optimizing Page Speed.,"So when I was creating my website I wasn't even thinking about image size and optimizing page speed.

I know you're supposed to use JPG for images and PNG for logos, and icons.

What should the maximum file sizes for product images and hero banners be?

Do I have to re-upload everything?

Is 10 images of 2-5 MB on the home page a problem?

What's the best way to compress everything?

edit: so i tested directly downloading images from the website and most were under 150kb although i think i definitely uploaded them at a higher amount, does this mean shopify is automatically reducing the size?

think this is the case because if it's one image that takes up the full width of the page it's still a high file size but images that end up smaller on the website have a small file size",16,6,2019-05-12,ECOM,0.04754582419991493,0.9240995645523071,0.02835456095635891

dropship,My first FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN Results - PLEASE HELP!,"Hello, I just finished running my first set of Facebook ads for my Shopify store.  The product is

a pet supply item for cats.  The ad sets ran for 3 days, each with a $5.00 budget per day.  In total,

I got 9 add to carts and 0 sales.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking over my results and I find I don't have the slightest idea how to make sense of these numbers!   Were these results promising?  Dismal?  Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I am deeply and desperately hoping someone will look over my numbers and give me some idea of how to make sense of these numbers.  I can't figure out how to proceed.  I don't want to spend another $100 only to get more of the same unless it will somehow lead to sales.  Without knowing what to fine-tune or fix, I feel all I can do is just repeat these same results!

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the details:

&amp;#x200B;

Conversion Event Location:

WEBSITE ADD TO CART

&amp;#x200B;

Countries:  US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand

Ages: 25-65+

Delivery Type: Standard

All ad sets used the same 60-second video ad and same ad copy.

&amp;#x200B;

PLACEMENTS:  Facebook Feeds, Instagram Feeds

BUDGET: $5 per day x 3 days per adset

&amp;#x200B;

With ad sets 1-5, I had the feature turned on that says:

""Expand results when it may improve performance at a lower cost per result.""  I foolishly thought Facebook would make a good decision, but now I am thinking that using this feature might have been a poor decision.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions:

1. What do you think of these numbers?  Are these results good or bad?
2. Why would 9 people add to cart but then abandon the cart?  I do not charge shipping or taxes, so nothing would have changed with the price from cart to checkout.
3. Should I try putting more money into the 3 ad sets that got ATCs?  If so, do I start with fresh ad sets or do I just turn the original ad sets back on with more money?

&amp;#x200B;

Any comments will be deeply, deeply appreciated.  Over the past two days, I have just been staring at these numbers, re-watching YouTube videos, and trying to make sense of my results.  Because I don't know why I didn't get more add to carts and sales, I don't know what to fix!   I have been feeling utterly confused and helpless and even overwhelmed.

shopify,Shopify Image Sizes,"Been doing some research on what it means to have the right image sizes for your Shopify store.

Nailed it down to three elements:

1. Space the images take on the screen
2. Dimensions and pixel number of the images
3. File sizes of the images

The first is just referring to the way we lay images out on the screen and consistency of height-to-width ratio. Second about the resolution of the images and making sure they look good for larger desktop screens as well as mobile. Third is to lower the file sizes of images through compression so as to reduce page loading speeds.

dropship,"Dropshipping site failed, so we decided to pivot fast","2 months ago we launched a dropshipping website with a partner. It's called [https://petlovers.co](https://petlovers.co)

We launched the site in 3 days using Shopify + Oberlo (Aliexpress).

Although **we got quick segmented visits using social networks (4,000 in a few days)**, *we did not make a sale*.

Not a single one.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? **We were too honest**.

We put in each product URL the text ""**it may take 25 days to ship**"" and, obviously, nobody bought a single product.

# As they say: fail cheap, fail fast

So we decided to **pivot the model** by passing it to a blog with a ""question and answer"" formula.

Posts that have 1 or more associated products. For example: [How to clean dog paws after walk](https://www.petlovers.co/dog-health/how-to-clean-dog-paws-after-walk/)

&amp;#x200B;

These products are s**old on Amazon using affiliation**. So we make sure that the logistics and the price will be the best ones.

# From social to organic

We have focused our efforts on **attracting organic traffic** and we are starting to get our first Top 20.

We wrote 45 posts focused on satisying users intent + some transactional ones.

We are using mostly long tails for the posts with 100-800 monthly searches on Google USA, UK, CA and AU.

dropship,"Are ""mentors"" legit?","I met a self-proclaimed dropship entrepreneur at an event who offered to show me the ropes. I took him up on the offer and met with him in-person recently. During the meeting he showed me his website, went into the back-end and showed me his six figure sales revenues (I guess to prove his numbers), and gave me a brief tutorial on how to do Facebook ads. He also answered a few questions I had (the correctness of which I'm questioning after a bit of further research).

&amp;#x200B;

He then told me the story of how when he got started he paid a dropshipping guru $15,000 to mentor him, give him ""winning products"" to sell, and help him get his store started, and earned it back plus interest within a month. He then offered to do the exact same service for me for only $2000.

&amp;#x200B;

However, he definitely gave off red-flag vibes to me. It's somewhat believable he may have some part in managing a successful Shopify store with a large revenue, but even then I'm questioning if he somehow fudged those numbers or is pulling some other trick to finesse me. He also claims he's worked with other clients and helped them get five-figure revenues within the first three months, and that he could ""guarantee"" that I would have the same, and he had ""testimonials"" to prove it. With all this in mind I'm extremely skeptical that if he was really that successful, he would give up his keys to success for someone for a mere $2000.

ecommerce,Large Magento site migration to WooCommerce?,"Hi looking for some advice, I am a WordPress developer at my job and I also have a few of my own clients which I do in my spare time. Long story short, one of my friends is running a very successful ecommerce site in Magento 1.9 and approached me last year to take over the hosting of this as with his last hosting it kept maxing out the bandwidth... This all went smoothly and he wants a re-design / development of the site. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are lots of niggly bugs in the current setup and he cannot get it listed as a recommended site on another website without issues like this fixed. He is open to whatever platform is used for the site, so (being a WordPress developer) I have recommended this and WooCommerce and plugins for linking into Amazon / ebay listings etc... as the current magento system does. I'm looking to move it away from Magento 1.9 so we can future-proof it more than anything else... and from a maintenance point of view for me, if I have built it from the ground up, I know where plugins, files and templates etc... are located.

&amp;#x200B;

There are approx 10,700 products (including variations) on the site so I know this will be a big task to migrate these.Kept getting timeouts when doing this the other day... I have seen there are plugins around for this kind of thing, just wondering if anyone has experience moving them on a site this big? and whether WooCommerce is the right option, or there is anything else you would recommend, I'm open to suggestions :)

dropship,Tip for people who don't know which direction to go towards.,"So this is what I did, I created an instagram page dedicated towards a specific niche and built it from there. Just posted related content and it grew. ( I started this Dec 25 2018) I created a pretty catchy username that fit the niche and planned to make that my store name. So after I hit 10k followers (yes this happened in less than 6 months) I built my store and promoted my first product on my instagram. I used the swipe up option on my story and created a post as well. That first day I hit 900 bucks in sales and about 470 in profit. The next day I managed to hit the 1k mark. So I knew that product worked within my niche. I created a facebook ad and targeted instagram and boom, it worked again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly think creating a brand is the best way to go. You can have free promotion to test whatever product you like, you have social proof and you dont have to pay influencers a dime. As of now my page is at 15k followers and they are all within my specific niche. Just a thought I would tell my story since a lot of people do not know what route to take.

I hope this doesn't come across as spam. I created a Shopify app that price tests items on Shopify, so you can figure out the optimal price for your products. It's pretty simple...you select the product you want to price test, list the different prices you want to test (up to 3) and then voila! Await your results to see different conversion rates for each variation. (Screenshots below)

The app is still in beta and hasn't been submitted to the Shopify store yet, and I was hoping that I could get some test users for this. If this is something that would be useful to your shop, please let me know and I'll send install instructions! (Although I may need to take a waiting list if I get too many, since I'm still working out the bugs)

shopify,"For the non-drop shippers out there! Shopify vs Etsy, which is the best for makers?","I know a lot of people get stuck between Shopify and Etsy (not that you have to choose one necessarily). 

But I've boiled down the difference to this:

Etsy is a marketplace, like a Facebook where artisans can sell their homemade products. Unfortunately, the only products you can sell on Etsy is handmade goods, vintage items, and craft supplies. So the site is perfect for:

Jewelry, Furniture, Toy, and Accessory makers.

But, if you are a crafter, you can expect to find [1.7 million users selling to over 33 million buyers](https://www.etsy.com/uk/sell?ref=ftr). Basically means you can do very little marketing and still have traffic going to your products from the community, who search for products and not brands.

Whereas on Shopify you can sell almost anything, except financial services, anything illegal, or high risk. Here there’s a lot more space, features, and in-built functions to build a strong unique brand. Though marketing efforts might have to be increased because there's no dedicated marketplace search engine like Etsy.

There are other advantages and disadvantages to being on this platform, and you can find these out in the article I wrote, [Shopify vs Etsy.](https://katanamrp.com/blog/shopify-vs-etsy?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_campaign=Distribution&amp;utm_content=BP_shopify_vs_shopify_16_05_19)

Now his ad spend is 10$ for each sale that means his proffit only 6.8$

now the product he buy i found it and it cost 5$(if he buy the chepest it piss of shit i must say there will be returns) for the cheapest one 

5 \* 456 = 2280(Now reduce the cost of product  3010-2280 = 730$)

If you want to know what keywords has been trending right now for the past 6 months, it is ""How to Find a Winning Product"" ""Find a Winning Product""  ""Winning Product"". 

Should I continue?

Over the years, old and experienced dropshippers have used the word ""winning product"" too much that it became a buzz word amongst new dropshippers and bloggers. It is so celebrated just behind the keyword ""dropshipping"" and ""How to start drop shipping"".

But despite the noise about this keyword, what we really do not understand is the process of finding one.

Some dropshippers will say, ""test the shit out of a product"", another will say ""subscribe to a program that will find a winning product for you."" 

Of course, as you might notice, I am not saying they are wrong, because if it doesn't work for them, they wont advice you to do it. The problem I have with it is that if you


A. TEST THE SHIT OUT OF A PRODUCT, the probability to waste a lot of money is in the probability of 5:1. Nonrefundable!


B. IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A PROGRAM LIKE NICHESCRAPER, you might be lucky and get your probability of loosing good cash to about 3:1 or sometimes if you are good with ads or you find good advertiser, you might get 2:1.

If that is the case, what about we go a little bit old school strategy that works well also like programs of niche scraper or ecomhunt as a third option that requires less investment, just that it will take your time and you need to learn certain skills if you do not want to hire.



The SOLUTION ORIENTED BRAND AWARENESS strategy!

This concept simply focuses on first building brand awareness by solving a specific problem with contents and tutorials (this is where you need teaching or writing skills), which will then lead your brand to becoming a trust worthy guy to refer a product that solves that same problem!

I will do a step by step tutorial on the Solution Oriented Brand Awareness strategy later on, because that is not the essence of this post.

The essence is this.


YES OR NO

YES, it is hard to find winning product because you probably are not the one that made that product a winning product, somebody makes that product trending. So, you might not have a clue about the emotions behind his ads and marketing strategy that makes that product a winning product.

Another way round is that, if you are burning cash on ads to find which product will sell on your niche, you might be wasting a lot of cash because you might not get it right with hitting the right target audience or the right emotion.

Remember that a buying decision is first an emotional decision before it is logical.



NO, it is not hard to get a winning product if of course you get lucky. And one thing about dropshipping is luck don't last 48 hours.

The other way is to use the Solution oriented brand awareness strategy so that you can target the right audience and control their heart while at it. It is smarter, and you would have made a lot of your profit before you have competitors.


Hope you get the point.

shopify,"Considering offering unique, extremely limited promotion- looking for expert advice","So I am considering offering a very unique, extremely limited promotion for the custom items I make. I have mostly business reasons for doing it and a few personal ones. I need a little help to figure out the most effective, productive way to do it to give my business as big of a boost as possible. ***Long post but I'll summarize at the end***

\*\*edit/note- It might give more context to mention that these are handmade plushies, the idea is I have set patterns but customize the colors and details. So somewhat more along the lines of individual commissions, so a decent amount of investment and personalization in each one, 1-3 days to make. Not sure if that changes anything.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **The offer-** I am considering offering an exceptionally **large discount to 2-4 people**. They would pay for shipping, and they would pay basically just over the cost of the materials used to make the products. The goal is to get a few products in the hands of people who are genuinely interested it and would leave reviews on my shopify and/or my facebook page, possibly elsewhere. Bonus if they like it so much they buy another at full price (common in organic customers, but that's a pool of 14 people).
2. **Target audience-** It is very important to me that the offer would be used ONLY by people genuinely interested in the products. I find that when I have organic customers who buy these often immediately buy a second custom item because of how much they love the experience and the product. The product sells extremely well when people have it in their hands. I do NOT want someone who is only interested in getting something cheap. The people who buy my ""cheaper"" products are more demanding, don't consider the actual value of a handmade custom item, I often lose money on them trying to meet said demands, and I just don't enjoy that experience. I'm not here for the ""you're charging too much"" should-be-buying-from-walmart people. \*\*I've tried pitching this offer to my friends, who are the \**exact*\* essence of my target audience, but they refuse any discounts whatsoever because they know the value of my product, but haven't bought yet because they have to save up for it.\*\*
3. **Business benefits of the offer-** Of course word-of-mouth advertising and reviews are good, but a huge benefit would be moving product. In my case being able to continue making things means I have more **visual examples of custom-made** products, to help give customers a sense of what they can do with it. My product has improved exponentially, which means current photos are lacking in that aspect too. I'm getting a light box any day now so I can go back and **create better photos**. Moving product is valuable to me in this aspect, so making just enough profit to keep buying new materials is a huge bonus for me. I also think charging a portion of money for this would help me weed out the potential unintended audience.
4. **Personal benefits-** I am just so sick of sitting on my a\*\* tweaking every little thing business-side possible. I know all of the technical stuff is important, but my stress meter is shooting through the roof right now. I only get a couple sales every few months through etsy, which is constantly going downhill and not made for people specializing in only a few products. The thing is, the fulfillment I get from making this is just amazing, **working with people is the #1 reward to me**, even when I'm giving stuff away, one look of joy on someone's face will **keep me going** for weeks. That's why I do it, and I really personally need that ego boost right now. But I have to do this in a way that's not losing money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns**\-

How **public or private** should I make this offer? I don't want to spam people I personally know any more, but I also don't want people to think they can just wait around long enough to pay a bare bones price for something really worth quite a bit. I could put it in a discord group, somewhere on reddit, on my business facebook or instagram account (but facebook tends to attract the cheapo-expects-walmart-prices folks, and family is constantly publicly trying to get me to drop prices/change products.)

I'm not sure **how big a discount** would be appropriate. I want it to be enough to get people racing to place an order. I would like to get these orders as fast as possible, because in about a week my schedule will be swamped. But I also need to be able to cover the cost of materials, a little more if possible. I was hoping to stock up on a couple things in bulk very soon. Fabric is about $3-5 per item, but I have to buy 1-2 yards at a time which is $12-17 per yard. Stuffing as I buy it now is about $3-5 per item. dual-colored items (which I'd be shooting for) typically also take 1-3 days to make. Ideally it'd be enough that if I had to buy a new yard of fabric I wouldn't lose money, so not considering labor I'd like maybe $15-20 before shipping.

How should I **market the offer**? How much of the reasoning should I publicly give for it if any?

&amp;#x200B;

***In summary-***

1. Big big discount to 2-4 people
2. Want people who'd typically buy my product anyway, bonus if they become repeat customers
3. Helps me take better custom-item photos w/o losing $$$. Get reviews, word-of-mouth advertisement
4. Making stuff makes me happy and rn I'm really sad :(

woocommerce,Client claims network I manage is the reason her woocommerce site gives a 500 error,"I help a friend out an manage their co-op office space wifi.  They had some issues with their previous provider - I just hooked them up with some affordable ubiquity access points and security appliance.

&amp;#x200B;

The network is very simple otherwise - ubiquity doesn't allow for anything complicated, and I have not enabled IDS or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this client is trying to run a shop out of one of the shared spaces and their wordpress /woocommerce site fails (500 error) when they try to make a transaction from that location.  From what I can see they are using wordpress - woocommerce and a plugin for paypal, woocommerce angelleye.  When they process the transaction from a cell phone or home location it goes through (not sure if other locations are screwing up and they have just not tested it enough).

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to be a nice guy and go above and beyond for these guys.  Unfortunately, their web dev is not familiar with things like developer tools for chrome (or any other browser for that matter).  So all I know is that it works outside of the network, but not on that network.  This network I manage has been up for 5 years with 0 problems until today.  I know they had issues with transactions before - but they made this switch and now it works ""everywhere"" but on my network.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked the webdev to create a test environment so that I can run fake transactions and try to help them out.  I also don't want them to screw up their live site while we try to work this out.  Unfortunately they have told me that they won't be doing that.

shopify,Successful launch but not as good result after a major upgrade to our app.,"Hey guys, not sure if this is appropriate to post here, if not my apologies and please guide me to the right place... My team and I are looking for honest feedback and opinions on our app https://getbargainator.com

We launched a ""test version"" of our app Bargainator in July/August of last year and we had really good feedback. At that point, Bargainator was the first negotiation chatbot for eCommerce, its only feature was to allow visitors to haggle for a discount on selected product or collections. Store owners had the possibility to choose how many rounds of negotiation (offers) were to be conducted before the final offer, the max discount they wish to offer and the ability to take over the chatbot in real time and interact directly with their customers. 

After receiving great feedbacks we decided to make major upgrades to our app. From our point of view, Bargainator was like a sales assistant helping store owners to make more sales using gamification and interaction to improve the shopping experience. We added an announcement feature (chatbot greeting visitors and announcing promotions or news/blogs) and email capture using the chatbot instead of a pop-up (less intrusive) to keep in line with our sales assistant chatbot concept. We also added a retargeting feature via a customizable automated email sequence to recapture lost sales. All features are aimed at growing sales. 

Since we launched our version 1 we did not have the success we were wishing for... Did we do something wrong? Did we miss something? To hard to understand? Any feedback is welcomed. 

Next features to come are: abandoned cart and checkout retargeting, multi-discount to allow client to bargain on more than 1 product/discount per order and upsell .",6,4,2019-05-20,ECOM,0.02978358045220375,0.9171801805496216,0.053036242723464966

dropship,My 1.4 Mills in 6 months success story,"Here is the new dropshipping model That's definetly here to stay for a few years, do know that those who don't evolve now will sink and very fast. Let's take a look at amazon releasing a 1 day shipping , that alone will make a lot of bussiness shrink but if you think outside the box you will make it and stay above the water for the next 10 years 

Here is what I did and how I found Success in dropshipping with a high ticket Niche

-I worked almost 3 weeks every night on my website and my theme, made it look incredible reputable and making it look like I was some huge brand.

-Created social media pages and started to grow organically , P.S I did all these before going live or advertising at all

- I chose a niche that have extremely high demand, Low competition+ the competition were all making 5 millions a year plus so that meant there was a market for everyone who jumped early on the niche.

- I did deep research on my niche and paid a freelancer on fiver 40 bucks to get me U.S Supplier for what I was selling.

-I contacted over 100 suppliers and flew to sign a contract with3 of them.

-I then signed a contract with a private label custom packages company So I can have my products delivered with my brand on the box, it's 0.75 cents a box 

-I then Started Advertising with snapchat &amp; On my second day I remember I did 7.3k on sales and approximetly 6.5k in profits that went on for 3  completly weeks with some days doing over 18k a day in revenue and I wasn't even expending 700 dollars a day on advertising

-I then moved to facebook &amp; Insta , I found myself  expending way more on those 2 plattforms than snapchat I think the highest day I ever had on facebook was 12k in one day with almost 3k on adspend alone so me and my partner decidez to quit on that

-We went back to snapchat and after 3 days we were booming again, but it wasn't as scalable as we wanted to be, we then saw an ad for a course of high ticket google shopping &amp; that was when everything changed, after learning google ads and failling our first 4 campaigns with over 28k wasted and breaking even we found the trick, and now we run both snapchat &amp; google shopping ads and we are killing it , we have done about 937k in less than 5 months now.


So I'm happy to help &amp; share any more in depth info that you need. Oh and our high tickets products are being delivered to our customers door in just  4 days for free.",61,153,2019-05-22,ECOM,0.0387459322810173,0.923799455165863,0.03745459392666817

shopify,My dad and I just made an online Toy Store. Info in the description and the question.,"TLDR - I helped my dad make an online Toy Store and he wants to advertise on billboards about 10 of them in the states around us. What do you think about this as advertising? He is more old school. I was thinking of using Google AdWords to advertise in those areas as well. [www.ProTinkerToys.com](https://www.ProTinkerToys.com)

Please read below for more information.

I would love to share my story and maybe ask for your help as well. I grew up with a great father who always took me with him for his business trips across the country. At first, you might think this would be terrible but the fact that he worked for a toy company made it actually really awesome. He later opened a toy store and did great… for a while. The recession hit pretty hard in 08/09 and he had to change jobs a few times but he has come back to toys. My dad has been in the industry for so long and loves toys so much he has a bunch of great contacts and knows a lot of distributors who have been in the game for a while too. This means he has managed to find toys that are sometimes 20+ years old and never been opened. Not a lot of stuff is super rare but there are some neat things he finds. He also looks for unique toys that aren’t mainstream. I would love for you guys to take a look at my dad's new website and let me know what you think. I just want to warn you that I am not a programmer and don’t 100% know what I am doing with this website BUT my dad takes care of all the customer support and even gives his number out that you can call him directly if there are any issues. I plan on continuing to add items and refine the website and look forward to your suggestions.

shopify,I have a super crappy store that’s doing well ... what should I fix first ??,"So I’m a bedroom seller with no idea of anything when it comes to Shopify, websites, marketing, whatever. 

Around a year ago I started a little Shopify business for fun (legal, insured fun) selling some handmade and/or bespoke items.

I’ve never paid for advertisement and everything is driven by my very plain, 1000 follower Instagram that I don’t have much knowledge of other than post, tag, story. Imagine your Nan discovered Instagram -I’m one notch above maybe. 

I also have the worst product photos taken with a crappy phone with no light box and dumb backgrounds. I’ve used a Shopify theme but thanks to my style skills the website layout looks like when I was learning html in 1999. 

I don’t use emails for marketing although I have a large bank of email update sign up addresses. I’ve never run a special offer/promotion. 


However. My traffic is in the top 15% of Shopify stores of comparable age, and my conversion rate is a steady 6%. My customers are invariably happy and I have an enormous rate of repeat custom too. I can’t believe it but there we go! I think it’s just a case of a niche being tapped and being reliable. 

I’d like to grow the business just a little bit. That might sound odd, but I’m employed full time and transitioning into part time isn’t an option currently (not necessarily financial, there’s all sorts of circumstances, not looking for advice on that part please). 

Which aspect would you target first to boost sales further by a small amount ? Sorry I can’t link the store as I’d like to keep my personal reddit stuff vaguely separate to the business.

dropship,"Started making $5,000usd daily with dropshipping (Need payment gateway help!)","I would greatly appreciate any form of input anyone may have towards my concern.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month, my dropshipping store started to do quite well, we started scaling and thankfully it now does $5,000+ in sales daily with a conversion rate of 6-10%. I'm great at making sites and generating impressions in neat ways, that's not the problem, its more about the backend that I struggle with.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a couple of really large orders come in and turn out to be fraudulent. Unfortunately, it was like 10% of my Stripe revenue at the time so they deemed me as a high-risk merchant and said they cannot support me as a client anymore, this was unpleasant.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently only using PayPal to accept my payments but am fearful they may put a hold on my account and the funds within it. I have had that happen before with a previous business but I think it was because I fought every claim that came through and now I refund every customer with an issue so I'm hoping they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice in terms of payment gateways and what step I should take next? What payment gateway you prefer? Do I need to apply as a high-risk merchant to future gateways now? Am I stressing over something that can be solved quite easily?

ecommerce,Does anyone here sell goods (imported from china/not dropshipped) via their own website to many different countries?,"If so, can I ask a few questions/get some advice? :

I want to be able to sell to more or less anywhere as the topic of my site can't really be restricted to one country - my domain name even has the word 'world' in it.

Up until now I just had a few print on demand tshirts/hoodies etc but now I want to start selling a couple of products relating to the topic of my site. I've looked at the dropship model and for suppliers on aliexpress but realised that customers would just be waiting for too long so I don't want to go down this route.

Instead I want to purchase some stock from alibaba and ship these to a fulfilment centre (e.g. amazon's centres) and then use only my website and advertising to try to sell the products (not amazon's market place).  On amazon's market place I know that I would be facing too much competition to sell these products so will stay clear of this, but I do have a facebook page with around 5000 people following that I can advertise my site to, and I plan to keep growing the site so I want to give this a go.

How does this sound?  


One issue I'm coming across with selling to multiple countries is that customers could be faced with surprise customs/import fees if say they purchase from europe but my stock is stored in an Amazon warehouse in the USA. For this reason I've considered shipping half my stock to a warehouse in Europe and half to a warehouse in the USA - but I'm noticing (i think) that this basically doubles shipping costs as it's not as simple as the weight being halved for each batch meaning half the price ..  Also, how would I set up my site so that the 'stock left' is shown as one whole number but if the customer's address is in or near the USA the product gets sent from there but if the customer is in or near the EU then it gets sent from the EU warehouse?  


This is really confusing me and I wonder how other sites/site owners manage it.  Any advice much appreciated as I really want to properly get started with this.",8,6,2019-05-25,ECOM,0.03973787650465965,0.9305101037025452,0.029752066358923912

I was being told we were denied because we were ""high risk"" and come to find after maybe the third denial, that one bank was kind enough to say we were on the TMF list. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure why were placed on the list. I have learned now that the credit card company had written my offices asking for copies of invoices and my secretary was not responding. Shortly after she got a failure to comply email, my processor called saying the credit card company called them and we got on the TMF list, etc. I fired her but at this point even if I try to call the credit card company back, I been told that I'm looking at least at a 5 year ban if not longer. Of course, there could be more to this? I don't know but nobody is giving me details. They all just say, ""We made our decision. Good day.""

ecommerce,Stay with Shopify or move to something else?,"We have a store on Shopify, currently pulling in around $100K/month. I’m the one who created the store, designed it, and maintains it. However, I’m constantly frustrated with the platform’s limitations. The company owners are always giving me things they’d like to implement either design-wise or on the backend that are impossible because Shopify doesn’t support it. Even simple things like being able to specify a shipping cost for individual products can’t be done without downloading an external app, and I sill couldn’t find an app that did exactly what we needed. They’re always wanting to do custom things in the cart, and I can’t even do basic design stuff on a page because of the way themes work. You don’t have access to the code, other than their Liquid files, and you can only add superficial CSS/HTML - and you’re stuck using their crappy Wordpress style editors. It’s frustrating not having full control of both the front and backend. You’re limited to whatever theme you have, and whatever Shopify allows. 

I get Shopify makes it easy to get a store up and running, but I’m wondering if there’s anything we can look at switching to in the future that gives us more control.

Also, should I pay return shipping, providing a free pre-paid label, or should I cover the cost of return shipping up to a ceiling, requiring the buyer to pay the difference?

Finally, what measures are generally taken to ensure that the buyer has not intentionally damaged the item as to attain a refund?

woocommerce,Help with product customisation that has 185 options,"Hi Everyone,

I'm new to Woocommerce, and I'm trying to work out how to set up a product. It's a choose your own crystals elixir. I would like customers to put the elixir in their shopping cart (for which the price will be attached), then be redirected to the customisation page. Customers need an overview of a picture of all the crystals. There are 185 options however. This will be easier on a laptop, but on a mobile device I envision it looking like going to someone's instagram page, and seeing three columns of tiles of crystals that you can scroll through. So pictures of each crystal are no smaller than that. I would like the customer to click on a crystal they are drawn to, and it goes straight into their shopping cart ie no need to open up another page on that crystal (there won't be anymore information for them there anyway). It's a very visual, 'let your subconscious guide you' service. They can select up to 7 crystals. They can however choose less if they prefer. Then they go to the checkout and pay. I'll mix their personalised elixir, and post it to them.

So my questions are:

1. Do you think this can be done as a variable product in Woocommerce? If not, any plugin recommendations that would handle this better?
2. If you think it's going to work as a variable product, am I setting up each crystal as its own SKU (with a $0.00 price) and setting them as the variable? Sorry this is where I get confused with the terminology and options. I've only seen video tutorials where they use customizing a T-shirt as an example (ie options are three sizes and three colours). For this to work the options have to be to choose from the pictures (one per crystal) and not a drop down list.

If anyone has any resources they know of that would cover this kind of product setup, feel free to direct me there.

ecommerce,Question for those who sell to many different countries,"Hi, I have a new woocommerce store and ideally I would like to sell to customers from anywhere.  This isn't dropshipping and I would like to import stock from China to a warehouse and then sell it from my site using facebook ads etc. But...I realised that if I want to sell to customers anywhere then if they live in another country to where the goods are held (in the warehouse), then they might get hit with expensive customs/import duties.

So, my question is, how do stores usually handle this? My website name and domain has the word 'world' in it so I really do need to be able to offer to customers everywhere.

Originally I was thinking I could import half a batch of products to (for example) an amazon fulfilment centre in Europe and then the other half to an amazon fulfilment centre in the USA...but this creates problems in that it (i) doubles my shipping costs because i'd be sending to 2 locations (ii) means i have to pay storage costs in two locations and (iii) means I would have to figure out a technical solution for showing the stock on my site as one whole and then also somehow automate sending from the warehouse closest to the customers location (so they don't need to pay the customs/import fees).

Because that all seems so complicated, I am thinking instead of just ordering a whole batch of products to an EU warehouse/fulfilment centre and then putting a note on my site that customers outside of the EU can still place an order but should be aware that they may need to pay extra import duties depending on the rules in their country.

We are launching a product for a singular product in the coming weeks. The product is for a company that has been B2B but is trying a new product B2C and we are working through the return policy. The product is unique and we are offering free refunds if people don't like the product for whatever reason (they don't like the color, they have a bad attitude, they don't like our attitude, it doesn't work, whatever). So here's my question:   


We are already offering free shipping. Does anyone here have experience with charging for return shipping? We want to make it easy, but because it is a home decor product in 15 different colors, we don't want people to buy 20 boxes and return 19 of them. We think charging or subtracting the shipping cost from the refund might be a reasonable way to both offer refunds, but discourage overbuying.  Our product is environmentally conscious and returned product may not be easily resold, so we also don't want to create too much waste. I would love to hear some thoughts.",10,12,2019-05-28,ECOM,0.02874368615448475,0.9291765689849854,0.04207977280020714
shopify,My scaling method that I currently use for all my campaigns(FB ADS),"Hey guys!

So I decided to share my scaling method that I use and hope this can help those who struggle. I consider this scaling method ""safe"" because we're not going to jump from low to high budgets. Each of my adsets has a $7 to $10 daily budget and that's it :)

&amp;#x200B;

It's quite simple but I actually didn't find too many people that use it. Instead of simple identical duplicates, each of my duplicates is a bit different. I change a small thing in the duplicate adset and let it run.

Note: I begin scaling after about 24-48 hours since launch and of course if my adsets are profitable or if I see potential.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Scale by device** \- One of the first things I do! I take the best performing adset I have and create 2 duplicates. One for mobile iOS users and one for mobile Android users. No ipods or tablets. Only phones.
2. **Scale by gender** \- If you're targeting both genders in 1 adset, one of the easiest ways is to break it into 2 duplicate adsets targeting 1 gender only.
3. **Scale by age** \- By looking at my reports and breaking my adset into age groups, I can see which age group performed better. If most of the sales came from people age 45-54 then my next duplicate adset will be only targeting 45-54
4. **Scale by country** \- If you're only selling in the US, you can always duplicate an existing adset and target a different country. Even if your ad is in english, it doesn't mean that people from Germany won't buy your product. Just do it!
5. **Scale by relationship status** \- Here we have plenty of options. Let's say we are targeting cat ladies and we have a simple adset targeting women who like cats at ages 25-54.

So instead of creating a simple identical duplicate, I can break this adset and target: a) Married women b) Widows c) in a relationship d) single e) engaged f)newly engaged etc...

This gives us plenty of options to create new adsets and each one will be different.

6) **Scale by education** \- back to the cat ladies. We can duplicate that working adset and target women who like cats and are currently in college. OR target ladies with a bachelor degree, 'some college', 'in university', 'masters degree' etc...

&amp;#x200B;

I can keep on going forever... As you can see, there are plenty of options to duplicate an adset and change a small thing. Currently, this is my scaling method.

And this is how a simple campaign with 3-4 adsets is growing into a campaign with 10, 20, 40 or more adsets. All of them working on low daily budgets. My record I think was almost 298 active adsets in 1 campaign.

Why do I use this method? Because of overlap... I know that if your audience is big enough, the chances of identical adsets actually overlapping is super low. But I found this method to actually work a lot better for me than simple identical duplicates. Also I'm not a big fan of duplicates with big budgets. I prefer spending $7 to $10 per adset and have a lot of adsets in 1 campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

Proof of a campaign I scaled in my niche:  [https://imgur.com/a/5jdN2Rm](https://imgur.com/a/5jdN2Rm)

Some people here don't believe the ""trust me"" kind of posts so I had to attach some screenshots. This campaign had a total of 140+ adsets.

This is from a Valentine's Day campaign. You can see that I was scaling by breaking down age groups, family status(new parents etc), by education, by device and by country(Canada).

One more thing I did is to duplicate my retargeting adsets. And also break them into age groups and devices. (Results were awesome!)

**Add to Cart** optimisation: Purchase optimisation refuses to work on this ad account. Whatever campaign I launch, if it has purchase optimisation, the results will be terrible. That's why I use only ATC optimisation which works really well.

That's it for today. Feel free to ask questions if you have some.

ecommerce,How can I send my product to influencers overseas?,"I am based in Australia, but I'm running a ecommerce business that retails in the US. Before my main shipment arrives to the US for fulfilment, I'd like to send the first few dozen products to influencers for marketing. Originally I wanted to send this shipment to myself in Australia and then personally ship to influencers in the US, but this would take extra time and money. 

My only strategy for this has been to recruit a fulfilment service that will pack my products and then deliver them to my influencers. My fulfilment service for the bulk order is Amazon, however, my first dozen or so products aren't going to be for sale and therefore can't really be fulfilled by Amazon. 

I would appreciate any input on the most efficient way to do this.

Do any of you have experience with Fesh and/or Shopify and would like to comment what you think of them?  
Things i'm looking for:  
\- User experience managing it \[can clients get around without asking you a million questions?\]  
\- Frontend customizability \[can you build a hardcore custom design on top of them?\]  
\- Exporting data \[how easy is it?\]  
\- Performance \[are the sites fast, is there any downtime, is caching a pain in the butt when updating things?\]

dropship,5 mistakes you're probably making that cost you money,"Here at Ecomhunt, we have reviewed thousands of online stores. From beginners to advanced sellers, these are the top 5 mistakes online store owners usually make.

## Too Many Popups:

Customers hate popups! If the first thing your customer sees is a popup, I guarantee that there’s a big chance we already pissed him off. So instead of focusing on that cool product he saw, he will now think about that annoying popup. Add to this “click to allow” popup or that huge facebook messenger button that loads up on each page and we probably lost our customer.

Keep it clean. Customers visiting your store don’t want to be bombarded with newsletter popups or “click allow for \[store name\] to send messages” type of popups. We spend money on ads and when we finally get potential customers to actually visit our store, we want the process to be fast, easy and clean.

For now, the only type of popup you must have on your store is an exit popup. This to catch leaving customers and hopefully convert them with a small discount.

## Slow Loading Time:

The number 1 way to lose customers. This may be obvious but you will be amazed on how many stores we review where the loading speed is really slow. The cause can be a lot of things… The usual suspect are the images, banners and other media files that are too heavy and cause the site to load slowly.

Instead of uploading JPEG image files, store owners upload their images in a PNG format. And if you didn’t know, PNG files are heavier than JPEG files.

Here’s what you should do:

First of all, use [TinyPNG’s](https://tinypng.com/) awesome free online service to compress your PNG and JPEG files. Next, check your site’s speed on [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/). Their free service is great and they’ll compare your site’s score to the average score. Make sure to read and follow GTmetrix suggestions.

Image files aren’t the only reason for a slow loading time. Sometimes, the reason can be due to a bad theme installed or other coding related issues.

## Lacking &amp; Bad Descriptions:

Copying an aliexpress product description is just you being lazy. Not only do they look bad and robotic, some of the text sometimes doesn’t make any sense.

This is what you should do:

1. **Tell a story around your product** – It doesn’t have to be long. A few sentences is all you need for a product description to be appealing and actually help you to convert your visitors into paying customers. You can also add some reasons why your customer should buy the product and how it can be used daily.
2. **Don’t forget important details** – If your product needs batteries to work, you should definitely let your customers know what type of batteries they will need. Or if batteries are included or not included in the package. By not including(“forgetting”) important details in your product description, you literally throw your money away. Because no matter how good or “HOT” your product is, a customer wouldn’t buy it if he doesn’t have all the needed information.
3. **Bad product titles** – Don’t use the same product title as you see on aliexpress and hope for the best. Make it more appealing by giving your product a unique name or add your store’s name in the beginning for it to look more brand like. For example: Instead of “Silver Butterfly Necklace Shine In The Dark Ruby” product name, use something like this “Magicalbeast’s Magic Shine necklace”. This in an example of a better looking product title with “branding”.

## Too Many Product Options(Variants):

So you’ve found a great product on aliexpress that you think has a good chance to sell. You import it to your store using Oberlo and you see that it has 20 colors to choose from.

Does your customer really needs **20 different color variants** to choose from?

If you’re going to continue with 20 color variants, you’re about to lose customers only because they will have a hard time choosing one. Your customer will spend a lot more time checking all the colors available and then going back to see again the colors he liked the most. This is bad because we need our customers to convert fast. This ain’t the flea market where customers stroll and check stuff out.

Instead, you should keep a maximum of 4-5 of the most popular color variants. Less options = The faster your customer will choose and proceed to checkout.

## No Reviews:

Nowadays, it’s so simple to import aliexpress reviews to your product page and edit it so it looks good, that there’s absolutely no reason why you shouldn’t do it.

Reviews are super important and have a huge impact on sales. Studies show that 84% of people trust online reviews as much as friends and that 91% of people actually read them. This should be enough for you to understand the power of reviews and to add them in your store if you haven’t.

**Make sure to edit the imported aliexpress reviews**. Not only by correcting grammar mistakes, but also changing the origin country and names. If most of your traffic comes from the US, it’s best if the review is written by “Eddie Murphy” from the USA and not “Dima Kazlov” from Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal note**: Some people may disagree with the popups or facebook messenger buttons being unnecessary but I believe that you should get that sale as fast as possible. Especially if you're a beginner and you're not bringing much traffic. That's why it's better to keep it clean so that our visitors go faster through the whole process.

shopify,Most Value IMO,"I browse these subreddits everyday and today I would like to share my thoughts based off of what so many are posting and asking. 

In so many words the posts here usually pertain with “how long before I reach a sale? Can you review my store? Do FB Ads really work?” And so on. 

Pretty straight questions but very rarely are pretty straight answers.

Here is my opinion based on my experience and other’s experiences as well. 

The academy from Shopify, google garage, and Facebook blueprint have the highest value IMO in terms of free information that is broken down and easy to understand and will give results when used. 

Adding these free “courses” with Gary Vee’s $1.80 engagement strategy on social media plus his additional branding techniques is really a jackpot winning lottery ticket if you’re heart is in the product your are selling. 

I sell by giving more then actually asking. Actually I never ask. When you understand this you will be able to scale figures with your brand, business or product. 

You gotta be both selfish and selfless with what you sell if you want consistency with your ROI positive. 

Be selfish in the learning and development but be selfless in the brand, business or product. 

Find what your passionate about that you can openly talk and create content about in both an educating and entertaining way and if you are at least mildly interesting of a human being you can build an audience that will be devoted to you. This is building trust, creating brand identity, and exposing brand loyalty. You do this by selflessly giving value to the point you give so much that your audience feels guilt not to buy your 20 dollar product. 

Just my thoughts. Basically you gotta find what’s in your heart and share it with others. I promise that the things you are passionate with is a solution to something/someone else’s problems and I promise it’s scalable enough to turn you at least 30k a year. And I really believe that many of you would be way more happy earning 30k a year doing what you love than being boxed away in a 9-5 in some cubicle in the corner of some office to a giant corporation that doesn’t care about you and demands productivity or bagging groceries and putting sandwiches into a brown bag as they pull there money out to pay you before walking off to their cars driving off. 

Dave Chappell has a great quote where he explains to his father who was a teacher “Dad if I can make a teachers salary being a comedian/actor than I am successful” Dave was explaining to his father that his dreams were realistic and not delusional. That he didn’t care about the numbers in his bank account as long as he could pay his bills doing what he loved, he was successful and happy.

I bring this up because I feel like there is a lot of you in here that see some video online “make a million dollars a day dropshipping” and get lost in impracticality. 

Anyway, I had a few minutes this morning, just wanted to share my thoughts with you I hope some of you can get some value in this.

dropship,I really need guidance,"**This post probably makes you think I just don't have what it takes to be successful in dropshipping**. But.. I think I'm just stuck and frustrated not only in dropshipping but in life in general. I work 2-10pm Monday to Friday in a stressful warehouse for supplements and vitamins making $1000CAD/2weeks.

 **I got into dropshipping about 2 months ago**. After working on a development store(shopify partner store) for 1 month that I got through a fiverr gig for ""finding winning products I (prematurely) launched my store 5 days ago, ran 8 FB ads and got 390 impressions and 2 add to carts. No checkout or sales. What I got from the data was that my video ad(25-45%avg VV) wasn't good(too fast, loud trumpet music), bad FB ad copy(my hook was ""IT'S TIME to.."", and bad sales page.

 **I've bought the courses ecomblueprint($250) and theroyalblueprint($200)**. I've invested in animoto($250US), shopify($79/m), fiverr gigs for winning products($40), AMEX card($97), and others. I'm well over invested $CAD1000 into this business but have yet to make any return. I pay $US145/mo as store expenses excluding ads(shopify, discounted pricing, loox, alishark).

I have 2 FB ads in review after making some improvements, and adding some countries. I'm just not sure what I should do. Is testing and analyzing ad and store data the best way to determine what's working/not working?

shopify,Sub collections on Shopify? Is this possible?,"Hey gang, I am absolutely not the tech guru type so please go easy on me. 

I’m making a shopify store for a friend and I need to have sub collections within my collections. I also need the products in these collections to be visible without viewing via the collection. 

From what I can tell, Shopify only allows for one layer of grouping eg one set of collections. 

Has anyone found a workaround for this and could kindly share with me? Perhaps I need to use an app?
