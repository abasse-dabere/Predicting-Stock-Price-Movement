I am new to the world of ecommerce, and I was wondering if anyone from Ontario, Canada (unless it’s just a canadian rule) knew if we had to register a business right away, or if there were 3 months (or what ever) that can be used before actually registering it to the government/ province?

ecommerce,"Looking for an e-commerce system that takes orders, but does not process immediate payments","Hi, we have a business selling meat online. We sell a number of products by weight (e.g $19.99 per kg), but the weights we sell are variable.

ecommerce,Improve Your Email Deliverability with These 8 Tried-and-Tested Tactics,"Hi Reddit, my colleague Emil just wrote this awesome post on Email Deliverability, so here it goes: 

There’s a lot that goes into successful e-commerce email marketing. Some of the areas that I see marketers fixating on is improving the subject line, copy, and CTA.

Don’t get me wrong. All of these things are important.

But pump the brakes.

Before you can maximize your open rate and engagement, you must first make sure that your emails are actually being delivered and finding their way to the inbox.

Otherwise, what’s the point?

And this is a bigger issue than you may think.

According to Return Path’s 2017 Email Deliverability Benchmark Report, 20 percent of email never reaches the inbox.

Instead, it winds up getting lost or in the spam folder.

So theoretically, one out of every five of the emails you send never makes it to the inbox.

And this can really marginalize the impact of your campaign in the long run.

Just think about all of the lost leads and squandered opportunities.

Right now I’d like to discuss some actionable steps you can take to improve email deliverability and ensure that more of your emails reach the intended recipients.

**Follow These 8 Email Deliverability Best Practices for Higher Open Rates**

This article is quite in-depth. To make life easier, I’ve broken each best practice down in more detail. 

1. Build Your IP Credibility
1. Use a Confirmed Opt-Out Process
1. Simplify the Opt-Out Process
1. Be Consistent with Your Sender Name
1. Don’t Overdo It with Your Emails
1. Stick to a Consistent Schedule
1. Use Segmentation
1. Create a Suppression List

Let’s look at each strategy in more detail.

**Best Practice #1: Build Your IP Credibility**

Spam has been and continues to be a major annoyance for email users.

Just take a look at the global spam volume as a percentage of total email traffic was from January 2014 to September 2017 according to Statista—as high as 71% and no lower than 52%.

Spam accounts for the majority of email—59.33 percent as of the latest report in September 2017.

What’s crazy is that’s actually an improvement from what it was in 2014. People all over the world are drowning in spam.

So ISP filters are constantly waging war against it.

To do so, they assess the IP of incoming emails to see how trustworthy they are.

If your IP seems suspicious, there’s a good chance that your email won’t reach the inbox.

So what you want to do is build your IP credibility. 
But how?

I recommend starting slow with an email campaign and only sending a small batch of emails to individuals who you know are engaged.

Once an ISP sees that recipients are opening and engaging with those emails, your IP should become more trustworthy.

Then over time, you can gradually increase the volume of your emails.

I also suggest checking your IP reputation (if you haven’t already).

This is easy to do and only takes a few seconds.

You may also want to use the MxToolbox Email Blacklist Check to see if your IP address has been blacklisted.

**Best Practice #2: Use a Confirmed Opt-In**

Also known as a double opt-in, a confirmed opt-in is where a person receives a confirmation email after subscribing.

From there, they confirm that they do in fact want to subscribe to your email list.

Here’s a good example from North Wild Kitchen:

https://i.imgur.com/uCQdxPY.jpg

While using a single opt-in or even a pre-checked box to subscribe may be tempting because of the volume of subscribers you’re likely to generate, it can hurt your long-term deliverability rate.

Why?

Because it can generate spam complaints, which are the kryptonite to your deliverability rate.

And there are some other major advantages associated with confirmed opt-ins including lower bounce rates, higher open rates, higher-quality leads, more engagement and lower unsubscribe rates.

While it will probably take longer to grow your email list using a confirmed opt-in, it’s pretty much guaranteed to improve email deliverability.

Not to mention, it’s compliant with the CAN-SPAM Act, which will help you avoid ugly penalties from the FTC.

**Best Practice #3: Simplify the Opt-Out Process**

I’m sure that by now you know you’re required to give subscribers the chance to opt-out at any time.

This is actually mandated by the CAN-SPAM Act.

But besides the legal aspect, it’s just good business.

After all, you don’t want to create any resentment when someone wants to unsubscribe from your email list but isn’t able to.

But here’s the thing.

Not only do you want to allow subscribers to opt-out, you want to make it incredibly easy for them to do so.

Why?

If someone can’t quickly find the unsubscribe box, they may end up marking your email as spam in order to avoid receiving future emails from you.

As I mentioned earlier, getting spam complaints is toxic to your IP and your email deliverability.

So what you want to do is place an unsubscribe button in a conspicuous location so that people can find it without any fuss.

I also recommend going with one-click unsubscribe for added convenience.

Just think about it. The last thing someone who’s already frustrated wants to do is jump through a bunch of hoops to opt-out.

Finally, be sure that you provide them with some sort of confirmation that they’ve successfully unsubscribed.

Here’s a good example:

https://i.imgur.com/6CSpPxm.jpg

Or if you want to gather some insight as to exactly why someone chose to unsubscribe, you can always include the option for them to provide their reasoning.

I’m sure you’ve come across one of these before.

https://i.imgur.com/8KV1NS2.png

I find this to be beneficial in the long run and should prevent you from making the same mistakes over and over.

**Best Practice #4: Be Consistent With Your Sender Name**

I mentioned in a recent post that having inaccurate sender information can get your emails sent to spam.

It should also be noted that this in direct violation of the CAN-SPAM Act and can get you fined as well.

So it’s clear that the sender information should state exactly who you are or who your company is.

But I would like to add another quick point. You should be consistent with the sender name.

In other words, don’t flip-flop between your personal name and your company name. Just choose one and stick with it. 

Our marketing emails always come from Rikke to build familiarity:

https://i.imgur.com/81HyPIa.png

When recipients are able to instantly recognize you, it lowers the likelihood of your emails getting flagged as spam.

**Best Practice #5: Don’t Over Do It With Your Emails**

Have you ever found yourself interested in a brand—so much so that you eagerly opt-in and anticipate to their emails?

However, you quickly find that the brand is barraging you with a surplus of emails and jamming up your already overflowing inbox.

I’ve seen this happen multiple times, and it’s incredibly annoying.

This is one of the quickest ways to sour a relationship and probably isn’t going to end well.

In some cases, your emails will simply be ignored, which lowers engagement and hurts your IP’s credibility.

Other times, would-be customers will choose to opt-out and will never be heard from again.

Or in a worst-case scenario, they’ll mark your email as spam.

The point here is that over sending is definitely something to avoid at all costs.

Now I realize that “over sending” is inherently subjective and could mean different frequencies to different marketers.

So let’s look at some data from Omnisend to shed some light on how frequently marketers are sending emails across the board:

https://i.imgur.com/jkh1YEY.png

According to their research, the vast majority of marketers (90 percent) send between 1-4 emails per month.

Very few (10 percent) send five or more per month.

While there is no perfect number that applies to every single brand, I think it’s safe to say that any more than eight emails per month is a bad idea.

And in most cases, I would stay away from sending any more than one per week.

This brings me to my next point.

**Best Practice #6: Stick to a Consistent Schedule**

It’s super important to establish some level of consistency with your emails because being erratic is a good way to get them sent to spam.

As I just mentioned, bombarding subscribers with emails is never a good idea.

But on the other hand, sending them too infrequently isn’t good for brand awareness.

So ideally, you’ll find a nice balance where you’re supplying your subscribers with fresh, interesting content and 
effectively nurturing your leads without overdoing it or going MIA for long periods.

To find this balance requires a bit of experimentation on your end.

What I suggest is trying out a few different frequencies over the course of a few of months to see what’s working best.

For instance, you may try just sending just one email during one month, two emails the following month and four emails the month after that.

Pay close attention to the reaction you get and adjust your frequency accordingly.

Once you find what’s working, stick with it.

**Best Practice #7: Use Segmentation**

As you’re probably aware, there’s a definite correlation between email engagement and deliverability.

When ISPs see that recipients are opening and engaging with your emails, this helps your IP build trust.

One of the best ways pound-for-pound to send engagement through the roof is by segmenting your email list.

MailChimp even performed a study that compared the results of segmented campaigns against the results of non-segmented campaigns.

Here were the global results:

* Segmented campaigns had a 14.31 percent higher open rate than non-segmented campaigns

* Segmented campaigns received 100.95 percent more clicks than non-segmented campaigns

* Segmented campaigns experienced 4.65 percent fewer bounces than non-segmented campaigns

On top of this, they had 3.9 percent fewer abuse reports and 9.37 percent fewer unsubscribers.

Those are some impressive numbers!

And it’s easy to see why when you consider just how big marketing personalization has become as of late.

In fact, Marketing Insider Group reports, “78 percent of US Internet userssaid personally relevant content from brands increases their purchase intent.”

https://i.imgur.com/VZgftoi.png

On top of that, Marketo found, “79 percent of consumers say they are only likely to engage with an offer if it has been personalized to reflect previous interactions the consumer has had with the brand.”

https://i.imgur.com/Vh7I3V4.png

The bottom line is that your leads don’t want to receive an email blast for the masses.

What they want are personalized emails that speak to their unique needs and address their specific pain points.

Arguably the best way to personalize your emails is through segmentation based on things like:

* Demographic

* Location

* Past purchases

* Position in the sales funnel

While this approach takes a bit more time than sending out a mass email, it’s far more effective at increasing engagement and ultimately improving deliverability.

**Best Practice #8: Create a Suppression List**

Let me iterate one last thing—it’s all about sender reputation.

Appeasing ISPs and establishing a positive sender reputation is heavily intertwined with deliverability.

DigitalMarketer makes a great point that not only is it important who you’re sending emails to, it’s just as important who you aren’t sending emails to.

Consequently, they recommend the following:

&gt; We also advise clients to not send to their inactive subscribers—the ones who aren’t engaging with their emails—as another way to boost sender reputation and deliverability.

To streamline this process, it’s wise to create a suppression list that contains email addresses of inactive subscribers or anyone who you wish to permanently exclude from sending future emails to.

By doing so, you prevent these recipients from adversely affecting your email deliverability.

The only question is, how long do you wait until you add someone to your suppression list?

While there is no definitive answer, DigitalMarketer offers some straightforward advice.

&gt; “The higher your send frequency, the shorter the period of time before you suppress.”

Keep this in mind when choosing who to exclude.

**Conclusion**

I feel like sometimes marketers get so obsessed with the more minute details of email optimization (e.g. finding the perfect number of characters in the subject line or extensively A/B testing CTAs) that they forget about one vital thing—making sure that their emails are actually ending up in subscribers’ inboxes.

This is one of the fundamentals and shouldn’t be overlooked.

When you consider that one out five emails never make it this far, it’s clear that there’s work to be done in this area.

Fortunately, there’s a lot that you can do to improve email deliverability, and the points mentioned here should all help.

And just remember one thing. At the end of the day, your main goal is to improve your sender reputation and ensure that ISPs trust your IP.

As long as the actions you take contribute to achieving that, you should be in good shape.

woocommerce,WooCommerce Approval Method,"Hello WooCommerce!

**Background:**
I am trying to create a WooCommerce Merchandising solution for one of my customers. Currently, we are using Pressero/eDocBuilder because it's a print-on-demand site. Under this platform, there is no way to have multiple inventories for one item. They want to add shirts and hats to the site, but, if we use our current platform, there would have to be 4 to 5 items (different sizes) for 1 product. This is going to make the UI very clunky and bogged down.

I proposed the idea to my bosses that we create a secondary site built on WooCommerce that will list all the merchandise. This also is a viable solution because they want to process credit card payments separately. Currently, the company covers all costs of marketing material but they are afraid if we add merchandise, the sales staff will go over board with ordering so they want the sales team to purchase them separately at a reduce rate.

Currently, the B2B Pressero site is set up with an approval method. Once an order is placed, it sends out a notification to the admins/managers to approve the order before we process it, print and ship. This helps to ensure the sales team doesn't go overboard with the ordering.

**Question:**
Does anyone know of a plug-in or if WooCommerce can handle this task? I read over WooCommerce Documentation and didn't get a definitive answer. I also Googled solutions before I came here and found this: 

http://dhrusya.com/products/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-admin-order-approval/

But, when I did some investigating, someone said it doesn't work/hasn't been supported for quite sometime.

So I am looking for any other approval solution that could be adapted to this project. Let me know if anyone has had this come up with a customer and how they handled it. I want to have a solution before I purpose it to the customer.

dropship,What am I doing wrong?,"So I started my first dropshipping store a bit over two weeks ago. I picked a niche I thought would be good (leggings and activewear, with bold patterns) and easy to market. I researched my niche at length to try to offer a better price for the same products as other people in my niche (as well as free shipping). I picked/kept a basic theme, thinking it would make my store easier to navigate and therefore improve conversion. I decided to have a uniform pricepoint (all leggings fifteen bucks, all activewear pants 25)

So far I tried:

-Facebook ads for specific products(got lots of likes on those posts, but a single sale)
-Facebook ads to get more likes on the page (barely worked)
-Facebook ads to get more visits on the website (worked but no one converted)
-Adwords for visits on the website (I get some visits, no conversions)
-Instagram ads (utterly useless, I got like three clicks)
-Free shipping on everything
-Offered a free product if people paid for shipping. No one bit.
-Made a giveaway contest (thought it would yield me a few likes but not even)
-SEO optimized my site as best I could. Still don't show up in search results even when typing my store's name directly.

Nothing. I got one sale, from a friend, who probably felt bad for me. So what is it that I'm not doing right?

-Not posting enough on Instagram/Twitter/etc?
-Should pick a cuter theme?
-Do I have unrealistic expectations of how quickly people make sales/how much one needs to invest in ads?
-Do I need to write better product descriptions? I'm afraid of spending dozens of hours on writing product descriptions and for it to not yield any results
-Is it just a bad niche?
-Is my production selection bad?
-Should I try influencer marketing instead? 

I see other stores in my niche sell the same products for grossly inflated prices and tons of people buying them. I see tons of contradictory advice EVERYWHERE. Dropshipping gurus swearing the free item pay for shipping trick yielded them tens of thousands of sales, people swearing only by adwords, other people saying these things are useless.

Short-term, though, I want to get some sales, so I'm starting off by dipping my toes into Facebook advertising. I've done a bit of research and am tailoring the audience for the ad down to a few hundred thousand people etc.  

Initially I had the idea to offer a 20% discount to the first, say, 500 orders.  But then I realise that nobody's ever heard of the store before so why would they even bother clicking through?

So now I'm conflicted - do I just do a generic announcement of the store launching?  A discount? A combination of them both.  I was planning to run the ad for seven days on a modest budget of $50 - as much for the stats as for the sales.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

ecommerce,Best platform,"Hey,

I currently run a fairly successful online business. We started using wordpress then switched to volusion a few years ago. I'm finding that more and more competitors etc are using shopify. The features that I'm seeing are much better then my current site. (Related products etc) 

Looking for advice: Shopify is a much steeper price point - About $1500 per month more for shopify enterprise vs Volusion

One thought was Magento 2 - I started looking into this back when it was released, but developers were new to it. 

One thing I don't have is time - So I would need to get this developed by someone. Shopify for this would probably be better. If I had lets say a $30,000 budget is magento 2 an option? And would the results be better then lets say moving over to shopify. 

Biggest concern I have (This is where I think, if it ain't broke) SEO etc - I'm concerned with moving everything over to watch sales drop completely. 

Any input is appreciated - Perhaps there's something else I'm not looking at?

shopify,Is it worth it to opt in for Shopify's domain?,"First off, I want to apologize if the question I'm asking is very dumb, as I am very new to this. I found an opportunity, and I really want to capitalize on it.

So, I got some really positive feedback on a design that I made for apparel, and people were saying that they really want to buy it. So, I've decided to open up a Shopify store.

But I'm in a rut right now: should I buy my domain name via Shopify or should I use other web hosting services (i.e. Bluehost, Hostgator, etc.)?

I'm asking this for two reasons, which, unfortunately, I would have to list via question-forme:

1. Does the web hosting service I pick matter? I'm asking this because I'm wondering if it will do anything for my shopify store's loading time, as I am well-aware that the speed at which the website loads up makes a huge impact on whether or not the customer wants to actually check it out.

2. Is it generally better to pick web hosting services that were made to cater towards providing mostly only those services? As opposed to Shopify, as it's made to cater towards entrepreneurs.

If you'd recommend that I buy a domain name via a web hosting service (that isn't Shopify), which would you recommend?

I've looked at tons of articles that have to do with ""the top 10 best web hosting services of 2018"", but some of them are really inconsistent. I'm feeling some attraction towards HostGator, as it's #1, #2, or #3 (basically top three) for most of the articles I've read, but I'm not too sure. My friend recommended that I use BlueHost, but she's never used any service other than BlueHost, so her recommendation isn't all that reliable (sorry, friend!).

I am a WordPress/ woocommerce user for the last several years but a client specifically requested for a shopify store.

I am usually looking for a small nudge in the right direction to get things working by editing the code but nope.

- Member only store requirement does not have the ability to approve new accounts: **Need an app for that!**
- Quantity based pricing tiers: **Need an app for that!**
- Hide menus on login page: **Need an app for that!**
- Need to use social media icons instead of just the text hyperlinks: **Need an app for that!**
...

I know that most if not all of this can be coded without apps but its almost impossible to get any help in the forums. With WordPress it is so easy to be pointed in the right direction to get something done.

ecommerce,Newbie needs help with FB ad results and conversion but no sales,"Hey everyone, I am very new to this whole shopify thing, and this is my first time ever making a website or trying my hand at ecommerce.

My store Addy's Attic is a baby boutique focused on unique and stylish baby clothes you wouldn't be able to find at your local department store. (Addysattic.co)

I have ran a few different ad sets on facebook using different products and experimenting with different audiences, trying to find the right audience for my products. The results from my different ad sets seemed right in line with where they should be (I have spent about $100 in ads so far) and while I have had alright conversion rates I have only had one sale.

I am trying to figure out how to convert my clicks into sales which is where I am struggling. I don't mind spending money on ads but i don't want to pour money into ad sets that aren't resulting in any sales.

My problem is that I don't know where I am going wrong. Is it my website that is turning potential sales away? My products? Are my ads not visually appealing, or are my audiences incorrect)\ (I don't think that is the case, or I wouldn't be getting such good stats on my ad sets right?)? Do I just need to run my ads for longer? I know I don't fully understand the ad results in the first place.

Basically I could use any and all advice on how how to better understand my ad set data, if my website looks alright and is appealing to potential customers and what i could do to make it better, and how to get better sales from the traffic I am already generating.

Here are some pictures of my ads, the stats on a couple of my ad sets, and some stats from my shopify store to better help you understand where I am coming from.

ecommerce,Experienced Entrepreneur looking to venture into Ecommerce (Help),"Hey guys. I come from a background of both private and public markets, and I wanted some help wrapping my brain on how modern ecommerce works, and I will break down how I want my site to work. And let me know how I can put all the puzzle pieces together to make it all work and make sense.



- the ecommerce site targets a specific popular video game.
- I want custom designs for generic merch (shirts, mugs, tote bags, hats, etc). I will be using fiverr to hire gfx artists for said designs
- I need a service to create/produce these products based on the custom designs I have, I need them produced based on site demand. And when these products are made I need them shipped to a fulfillment service
- I can't be bothered with the storing, packaging, and delivery aspect of the business, so I need a 'competitive' fulfillment service that will receive all the product from the product producers (from last bullet point). So they will then handle all of the above.
- I obviously need a platform for my website that has all the typical functions of an ecommerce site. I was thinking Wordpress or Shopify. But I'm open to ideas
- the marketing side of it is something I am experienced with, I can develop video ads as well as normal social media ads and target them to the right audience. As well as whatever else is necessary that I know how to do. I have the marketing covered. 
- finances and startups funds are not an issue, but how much should I look to put in as sufficient seed money for the best possibility of success? (I realize seed money doesn't guarentee success I just want to startup with the right amount)
- scaling would be based on consumer demand



These are my thoughts. I need help putting the puzzle pieces together to make it all work out the way I need the business to run. Any other insight or issues I haven't considered would be amazing as responses. If someone experienced in ecommerce actually wants to walk me through this (through pm or even call), I can make it worth their while. I'm new to this industry, so I don't fully understand how all this works. Thanks

&gt;""National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on President Trump targeting Amazon.
The Supreme Court will begin on Tuesday hearing arguments in a case that could reshape the online shopping landscape.

&gt;In South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., the plaintiff is asking the court to consider overturning a two-decades-old ruling that allows online sellers to avoid collecting sales taxes in states where they have no physical, brick-and-mortar presence.

&gt;If the current law is changed, a state will be able to tax all online purchases made by its residents even for a transaction carried out beyond its borders. In some cases, such a change would raise prices for consumers shopping online.

&gt;The Supreme Court decided the current tax structure in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, in 1992, when e-commerce made up a much less substantial portion of retail sales.

&gt;E-commerce sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $119 billion, up more than 3% from the previous quarter and nearly 17% from a year earlier, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The online sales comprised more than 9% of total sales in the U.S.""

We're a large established e-commerce store in Asia (reaching 7 figures a year and growing fast, with 1000+ SKUs), and we're rebuilding our frankly ancient website. We've hired an agency to do this but currently they're saying that once we've established the templates/layout of each Page, e.g. homepage, product page, etc., we won't be able to change it once it's coded. I know drag and drop page builders are available in Shopify but is this function only available on hosted sites? 

The reason we went with a custom site was because we're a wine and spirits company and there are some specialised aspects we wanted to add, but it seems like the current custom site is even more inflexible than a hosted site such as Shopify. The overall fee for the website plus 1 year of maintenance is about $32k USD so I don't know if their fees has an impact on this... 

I don't have any experience with building websites since I'm just the Marketing Manager so would love any insight. Please let me know if I need to provide any more information. Thank you!!

woocommerce,Importing new and existing products?,"Hello guys. I tried to fix something on my site and it pretty much ruined the whole site. I have a back up from a week ago, which has everything the way I want it to be, but my client has added about 20 new products to the site.

I exported all 20 products as a .csv and have them saved on my computer. My plan is to back up the site to a week ago and then import the new products.

I am afraid to do this because if I import these products, some of them will be new, but others already exist. Not to mention that some of the images are already saved in the media library.

What is the worst that could happen if I import new and existing products onto my back up site? Will the images duplicate? Will something worse happen? How do I mitigate the damage as much as possible?

ecommerce,Need help trying to automate more of my shipping,"Hey folks,

I’m about to launch a Magento site selling building materials in the US.

In my other business which is totally offline and traditional, we ship FTL and LTL quantities of goods and there’s a lot of interaction and manual labour between my orders processing clerk, the warehouse and the various carriers  who deliver the goods. This new business will be shipping more orders of smaller sizes. 

For my ecommerce/magento site I want to automate all of this as much as possible. For those of you with experience in ecommerce shipping, what broad strategy would you recommend? I anticipate that I’ll need to switch to using fulfillment centers that are prepared to break cartons and ship smaller orders.

dropship,Who purchases from dropship sites?,"I'm looking into opening a dropship Shopify store for a side job/hobby, and am very familiar with e-commerce and dropshipping (I work for a manufacturer and develop products and run the e-commerce site) but can't wrap my head around the type of person who actually purchases from these types of sites. To me at least, it's so obvious these items can be found on Amazon, often at lower prices with faster shipping. People can't be this oblivious... I hope.

For me the only viable way is to curate a small catalogue of niche items and market the hell out of it as a lifestyle brand on Instagram. But even then I think it'd be difficult, as such a lifestyle brand entails strong branding, and if you're dropshipping from China the packaging and other small details that make you a legit retailer are out the window.

dropship,Dropshipping Slack Channel - Mentorship/Collaborative Community,"Over the course of the past 2 years, I've been on the dropshipping journey doing whatever I could to make a ""liveable"" income. Having got to that point where my first partnership did 100k in gross (year 1) and a new corporate venture that's brought in 200k+ in 4 months, I wanted to dedicate my free time to helping out others who are struggling, need advice, or simply guidance on where to go next. 

I've always come back to this thread to throw in my 2 cents, heed caution to the masses on where not to get screwed *cough* Shopify Payments, and so much more. I've also viewed and dealt with my fair share of cocky assholes who think they are know-it-alls and while behind a computer screen decide to be condescending to those who simply need a helping hand. 

While this thread might be beneficial for some, I see it lacking in many areas where experts or seasoned dropshippers could play a big role in making a difference. Many turn to Guru's on Youtube or courses that cost absurd amounts of money, but this info is already out there for free, you just either need to find it, or find people willing to share it with you. 

So, I decided to create a Slack Channel for dropshipping. I originally planned to make YouTube videos but wanted to do something different. I wanted to provide an instant answer/connection to someone with advice alongside other individuals who either have the same question or offer up their own opinion solution. 

This Slack Channel will be dedicated to dropshipping and will have multi-faceted channels related to marketing, web design, aliexpress, branding, website feedback and more! Condescending, abusive, or harassing remarks will not be tolerated. This is a community open to all who have the same goal in mind: Dropshipping Success.

ecommerce,[DROPSHIPPING] TOP 3 Competitive advantages for high revenue stores,"Hey!

Profit margins aside, the guys and gals running 6-7 figures / month revenue stores on a dropship model - what are your top competitive advantages? 

I've ran two profitable 5-figure revenue/week stores so far (one as the founder and the other as a co-founder). With the former the competitive edge was acquiring products at a way, way cheaper price than most players in the market could. With the other we actually manufactured the product ourselves and the know-how/expertise to build such a product is quite high-entry for your average Joe.

Another guy I know who runs low 7 figures/month revenue relies on economies of scale, brand recognition, repeat customers and being creative with taxes.

So in conclusion - offering fast shipping, friendly customer support, understanding performance marketing and getting your CPS down, adding a bunch of upsells to increase your average cart value etc. just won't cut it in 2018. It's the bare minimum you have to bring to the table.

shopify,Could Shopify Payments Shutdown and Destroy Your Store?,"So yesterday u/Morganzolko posted here on r/Shopify a post titled [What the Actual Fuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/8dip4b/what_the_actual_fuck/)

In this post he tells how Shopify payments shut his store down. I responded to the post and got a number of private messages asking me about why his store was shutdown, and about merchant processing and high risk processing.

Long story short there's 2 potential issues with his store. The most obvious is  he's using the Backwoods Cigar Companies trademarked logo and artwork, you can't do that. This is most likely why his store was shutdown. Typically Shopify will let you maintain a store selling almost anything but Shopify Payments aka Stripe is much more strict. Potentially however if Backwoods issued a DCMA takedown potentially they could knock his entire store offline.

There is a small change they don't like him selling weed hoodies and stuff but typically that stuff is allowed, typically only paraphanalia is not allowed, shirts and stuff typically are. 

Long story short Paypal and Stripe are great in the sense they are quick and easy to setup but the downside is they are not true merchant accounts, they are third party aggregators and because of that your oftentimes paying higher rates than you could otherwise get. Your also more likely to run into issues like having your funds frozen, having your processing account shutdown, having a rolling reserve placed on you, etc.

Whether you yourself are a high risk business or not I think it's always good to maintain several merchant accounts so if you ever do have any issues your business doesn't come to a screetching halt, your able to switch processors and continue processing. I also think it's a good idea to have a real merchant processor like [Charge.Com](http://www.charge.com/banners/click.php?a=johnn520) who also handles high risk accounts. You can still use Paypal, I get that people like it, but don't put all your eggs in one basket.

dropship,Dropshipping nightmare..defective items,"So i recently experimented with dropshipping and with some luck made a gross profit of 2,100$ and a net of a little over a 1000.

Then i received a message from customer stating they received the item but it was defective..wouldnt work with his game system (it was a game controller). Now as the items arrive to the customers  Im hearing similair stories smh defective controller..buttons falling apart etc. Wtf is going on ? What should I do ? I really dont wanna give all this money back lol but i know ebay is going to force me too. Can i refund through Aliexpress. I sold over 60 of these items so the blowback financially would suck.

dropship,Accepting returns?,"How does this work? Do you accept returns? If so, three questions for you all.

1) Who is the item sent back to?

2) Assuming it's sent back to the supplier and not yourself, are overseas suppliers usually good with refunding buyers?

3) If you do, in fact, ship back to the supplier, won't that cause any trouble since, China isn't mentioned anywhere on most of the About Us or Returns listings on drop shippers websites and so when the customer goes to return an item, might feel like they've been duped in a way because they now have to pay for international return shipping fees when they bought an item domestically?

p.s. When it comes to exchanges, I've read that people just tell them to keep the product and exchange at no cost, so I'm not talking about that here.

ecommerce,AMA - Ask Me Anything - 2018 Edition [$60M+ in Gross Marketplace Sales],"Hello fellow Ecommerce Warriors!

My name is Fred, and last year I posted an AMA \(Ask Me Anything\) post here and it got some really good questions and feedback.  I was sitting here sippin' my Saturday AM coffee and browsing the threads and thought it would be a good time to do another one.

Quick bio for reference:   I own several e\-commerce sites and our company has been a major seller on all of the big marketplaces over the past decade.  Our business model initially started out as 100&amp;#37; dropship from US\-based distributors and from that grew into dropship, wholesale, FBA, and private label.   Over the past year I've actually downsized my company so I can be more productive and spend time focusing on my own PL brands, my E\-BusinessOnline podcast and consulting, and my REAL passion, which is creating music.  As of writing this post I'm 47 years old and in the midst of doing music and e\-commerce full\-time, I'm trying to keep up with my wife and 4 kids!

My company has generated over $60 million in gross sales on Amazon, Walmart, Jet, Newegg, Rakuten, Wish, PriceFalls, eBay, BestBuy \(that marketplace no longer operates\) and some I'm probably forgetting.   We've operated our own sites on multiple shopping platforms \(including the super old days of osCommerce, ZenCart\) but in past years BigCommerce and Shopify.

I've been through lawsuits, suspensions, and all the ugly horrible stuff that can happen \(waking up in the morning to 500 orders where your price feed got jacked up and you sold the wrong item, or the right item at the wrong price\) and have seen some of the BEST in eCommerce and some of the WORST scams.

I'm not a PRO at anything, I just have a lot of experience, some great success, and some horrible mistakes that have given me an education and I enjoy sharing it, so ... without further ado ... ASK ME ANYTHING!",71,32,2018-04-21,ECOM,0.04178864136338234,0.923914909362793,0.034296415746212006
dropship,The illusion of easy. My first attempt at drop shipping without knowing the rules.,"Like everybody else, except my grandpa, who is dead, I’ve decided to start a drop shipping business.

We, millennials love the idea of not putting the work and make some money. So if you really want to know our sense of business I’ve summarized this for you.

Browsing AliExpress for some time, I’ve stumbled upon some really interesting clothes and I was thinking that those are pretty different from what we usually shop in my country \(Romania\). **At that point, I didn’t know anything about drop shipping.**

Because it's a pretty long case study I suggest to check the whole thing here on Medium:

They do not want any sort of pc (pc, android tablet, phone, raspberry pi, micro android device) in the restaurant. I know this is possible with a smart google-cloud-print enabled printer, but all they have is a regular thermal printer with usb and wifi capabilities. The printer successfully works (prints an invoice when an order is received through a Woocommerce-enabled site) as long as it is connected to a pc via USB or via a wireless network to the pc, but they don't have or want another pc box.

ecommerce,should I stick to only epacket?,"Hey everyone, I have been dropshipping necklaces over the past month and have already gotten $200 in revenue. At the moment most of them have been through the shipping option on Aliexpress that says 20-39 days. I have been telling my customers that since it's handmade and high demand it takes weeks to make and they can expect it in 3-5 weeks. I have also been offering an expedited shipping option (e-packet) for only $1.5 more  (it was $2) but no one has taken it yet.

anyways, although it's too early to have people ask where their stuff is, I am expecting to start getting these emails by reading horror stories on here.

I was wondering if you guys think I'm making a mistake by not just using epacket in the first place? should I keep it the way it is or should I start paying out of pocket for e-packet on everything? if I do that it would only lower my profit to about $2 a necklace",4,2,2018-04-21,ECOM,0.17906001210212708,0.7805752754211426,0.040364719927310944

ecommerce,I'm beginning to really hate Shopify,"A year ago, I would've advised every eCommerce business use Shopify, but I am beginning to *hate* the direction this platform is moving in.

**tldr** I believe Shopifys core target market is to those who will never a single sale, while Shopify sells an easy way to make money story.

1. Shopify is pushing Aliexpress drop shipping with shit like Oberlo (which was created and owned by Shopify). Anyone with half an ounce of common sense knows this isn't a viable business model (I'm sorry to the 95% of r/ecommerce who may be insulted by that statement).

Shopify is selling the dream that any Tom, Dick or Harry can whip up a website, list products they will never touch and sit back and watch the money roll in, with no risk.

Oberlo brings me to another Shopify developed app, Kit, which promises to 'Make social media marketing easy'.

Kit is not a super advanced piece of AI which can run the optimal facebook ads for you. It's an app for the lazy, the ones who don't know how to use FB marketing and don't want to know how. 

Shopify is profiting off the naive, and imo have lost a ton of integrity by doing so.

2. You need an app for every damn thing. Some apps work well, some are obscenely overpriced, but the majority are useless shit that promise to boost conversions while don't make much of an impact at all. And, because there are so many different developers, most of the apps lack consistency with each other and almost always do in comparison to your website.

I love the interface, I love the simplicity, but I wish I went with Woo

If anyone disagrees with any of the points I've made then please tell me where you think I'm wrong.

I managed to accomplish that using:

* WooCommerce
* Facebook Ads
* Selling my own private label product

Last year I was pushing hard with *Dropshipping from China* and I've made some decent results with it, but based on my whole experience, that business model is real a pain in the a** to be sustained over time.

So, I stepped back and I spent almost 4, 5 months in research, product development and building the right foundation from scratch to start building something that has a better chance to succeed over time.

Without going in much detail in this post, I want to say one thing - *Product is 80% of your success*, no matter what platform you're using, what tools, apps, plugins you name it. 

You can't throw s**t against the wall and hoping that it will stick. This is why there are so many people trying to sell crap and always asking the question ""Why am I not able to succeed""

Ecommerce is a great model, but it has to be built in a fashion to serve PEOPLE, not ROBOTS.

dropship,Question about - Branding and the items being sent over to your customers.,"This seems like a fairly reasonable question which has probably been asked a lot so I apologize if I'm the 1,0000 person. 

I've created a website. Actually, It's a website I purchased (the domain) and had a logo created for it which was suppose to be a clothing line that never launched. So I figure hell I might as well use the name and logo for my drop shipping. It's a general name, nothing pointing to a certain category like buymywatches.com.

The problem I'm seeing while searching for products is they come either the name or logo on the product or on the packaging.

Doesn't this scare off a customer if they see a completely different name then the one they purchased it from?

dropship,What are some good strategies to select your dropship products?,"Hey Dropship community

I’m currently running a Shopify store selling innovative products using drop shipping. The store just hit its 2 months Anniversary, during the time I got some sales here and there, but it’s not steady. 

Now I’m reviewing my product strategy, aiming to make the sales more consistent (yea I know, that’s what everyone wants too). Currently I’m doing market research using Google Trend, Keyword Planner and etc. I was able to identify some products that are in high demand, but the reality could be that a lot of other people also found them and are already selling them. 

So here is my question for our Dropship community - what’s your strategy or approach to decide what products to list on your store, do you go with the demand or the niche? And how do you overcome the challenges come with it?

dropship,How bleak is the situation? What kind of a budget do you need?,"Been browsing around for a while and I've been thinking about getting into dropshipping but wondering if it really is getting too hard right now for a new dropshipper?

People say Instagram is too saturated, shippers are running FB adds and selling products at very low margins and even a immediate net loss to build up a backend, payment providers seem to not really like dropshipping, people getting their funds frozen, paypal limited etc. It all sounds rather bleak and hard for a new dropshipper to compete with. 

Also curious about how much of a initial budget does one need?
Well obviously you need to set up Shopify (assuming that's your chosen platform) and domain, but u also probably want some paid apps to your store, get someone to design a logo, maybe set up a business e-mail and a few additional tools/analytics or what have you? And then obviously the main cost is the advertising, I think I should probably expect to lose quite a bit at first before building up data and finding something that works, (if I ever do) so wondering how how much of a budget do you think I should have to be able to give it a fair shot?

Basically I'm just in a position where I have a few hundred $ to spend and I would like to take a attempt at running some kind of a e-commerce thing, I'm not expecting any kind of fast success and willing to put in work but I don't want to attempt to milk a dead cow either.

dropship,Dropshipping is not dead..,"Hey Guys,

So dropshipping on Shopify is a real hot topic right now. But unfortunately most of the people that create a Shopify store fail. I think the main reason people fail is because they don't know how to pick a winning product.. The right product with the decent Facebook targeting can literally change your life. If you are really passionate about something try using instagram influencers to sell your products to build data for your facebook pixel. But if you're doing it for the money only, then you have to sell products that are currently trending. 

Here are some other tips
1 Be aware of whats going on in pop culture and try to spin off a product 
2. Dont attempt to sell what you like using facebook ads
3. Identify what people are constantly talking about or what the big news headline is. 
4.Try to sell different variants of the same product, this may increase the average order value. Meaning more profit for you. 



I really hope this brings value to someone either starting a Shopify business or currently struggling with one. 

Good Luck!",10,10,2018-04-27,ECOM,0.042909495532512665,0.8962920308113098,0.06079841032624245
ecommerce,Magento Platform vs Custom Developer's Own CMS,"We're a very large retailer in urgent need of a new website that's capable of handling tens of thousands of products, including stock and order management. We also need optimised landing pages to generate leads for services we provide in store. Blogs, help guides/buyer guides are also going to be a core feature of the new website - for conversion and SEO. This needs to promote both ecommerce and in store sales - so a bit of a catalogue for the showrooms too. There's potential for huge growth so this needs to be flexible and scalable for the future.

I've got lots of different web developer proposals, most offering Magento 2.0 which I originally included in my spec. However, my favourite proposal has said they don't recommend Magento but their own custom built platform that they've already made. I wasn't keen but I've seen some of their work on this platform and there's some awesome functionality and super fast load times. They're the most enthusiastic, knowledgeable and passionate devs that I've met. I think they'd do a great job of this project but I've read mixed things about custom platforms (the usual pros and cons). 

I guess I'm looking for recommendations on which way I should go based on what we need the website to do. Any advice appreciated.

I kinda feel that he’s wrong, because you just can’t open up a website and only allow users to take pictures of your products or explain your services with a price tag, and only present their emails or phone numbers and leave the rest of the business to themselves.

Read on if you need more clarification and a quick history lesson......

We are nearing a launch of an ecommerce store for my small business.  For the past 25 years we have grown to several retail outlets and used a leased ecommerce site.   It was very clear that we were never going to go anywhere with the leased site so we had our own site built using a fairly open source platform.  

I am the owner of my business and have taken the site through the development phases with a team of experienced developers while also growing the retail side of things.  (Who knew you could still grow retail!).  We are nearing the end of the first couple of phases where we will actually go live.  There are still bells and whistles to be added in future phases but it’s time to start getting some of our investment back and opening our doors to a larger audience.   

So back to my question.....I am very confident that our online business will grow and far exceed our retail sales.   I would really like to hire an ecommerce store manager , for lack of a better term,  to keep everything in line, moving forward, addressing customer concerns, checking content and keeping track of what’s happening.    As an experienced retailer I already have HR, customer Service, packing and shipping, phone and email support and product on the shelf.  I don’t need any of this and I am quite happy with our dev team.  I’d love to start developing a job description and position for this critical foundation.   

Thanks for any advise.  Much appreciated.  

Edit: I want this job in my company because I am very passionate about it and see great potential but I know that the rest of my organization needs my attention as well.",6,3,2018-04-28,ECOM,0.022284111008048058,0.8994275331497192,0.07828838378190994

woocommerce,Log Inventory Purchases within WooCommerce,"Hey guys. A client wants to able to log his inventory purchases to his shop, along with the ability to increase the inventory itself.

So for example, he wants to add 10 t-shirts and 10 pants, he would want to register the cost of those products (kind of like a sale to himself), as well as add it to the inventory to then be available to sell to the public.

A history of these inventory purchases would be nice, so it could later be used in comparison to sales.

Do you guys know of any plugin or code that would be able to achieve this?

ecommerce,3rd Party Logistics &amp; Warehousing,"Hi,
My current supply chain is through an Order Fulfillment API, where an international supplier creates and ships the products when a customer places the order.

Though convenient, this is quite expensive (high product &amp; shipping costs, bad exchange rate) so I have decided to buy my inventory in bulk and store it in a local warehouse who handles the fulfillment and shipping as well, as it would be much cheaper.

3PL and warehousing is a completely new area for me. What should I look for when choosing which warehouse I will use? What should I ask? Are there more things to consider? Does anyone have experience previously choosing or currently using a warehouse?

ecommerce,I just got offered a possible opportunity and i need advice,"Here's my situation. My bosses brother may offer me a commission based opportunity soon that could potentially be a lucrative situation for all three of us. My boss and his brother co-own a business together in a industry that I am familiar with and very passionate about. I might be handling online sales for him soon. The products are definitely in the high ticket category but they are also one that are very sought after. So when they do get listed for sale they sell quick. Just recently he started working together with one of the bigger names in the industry and they offered us there items at damn near there cost. Their giving him access to there entire inventory which is a impressive one at that. Not only that but when we sell something in there inventory they take over shipping it but brand it with our label. which is amazing for us because it's something that is easily destroyed if shipped improperly.

Anyway here is what I'm curious about.

1) what if any are the best sources of information online where I can learn the necessary processes for selling on eBay and hopefully avoiding as many new guy mistakes as possible. Also a factor is price, I'm not able to jump on any of these absurdly priced courses that are the first thing that pop up on Google when you try and search for something like this. If there's any free info that's complete that would be ideal.

2) during some of the searching I've done I have seen software advertised that links products from one site ( our wholesale partner) to sites like eBay and Amazon. One of which updates current inventory for said item in real time. Are there preferred versions or companies that outshine the others for something like this?

Any help is greatly appreciated.",3,2,2018-04-29,ECOM,0.021848298609256744,0.92415452003479,0.05399711802601814
shopify,Shopify's Satish Kanwar's Advice To Entrepreneurs: Don't Wait For The Perfect Moment,"For [Satish Kanwar](http://shopifypro.xyz/shopify-advice/rs), the idea that ""there's no time like the present,"" is less a cliche and more a piece of practical advice for anyone thinking about starting a business.

""What people don't realize before it's too late, often, is that there's no such thing as a perfect moment to become an entrepreneur. You have to force yourself to go now.""

The vice-president of product for Shopify ought to know.

In 10 weeks, Jet Cooper, the Toronto agency he co-founded, went from start-up status to merging with the Ottawa-based e-commerce site. What started as a meeting between Kanwar and Shopify's Tobias Lütke quickly evolved into a partnership that's since grown their Toronto business from 30-some people to over 400 employees.

dropship,First day marketing my drop shipping product.,"Yesterday was my first day truly marketing my drop ship product. I did a free + shipping with an Instagram influencer.

Posted at about 10:30am yesterday CST, so it's been a little less then a day.

Results:
161 visitors
68 added to cart
48 went to checkout
2 orders.

Product price 2.97. The two orders were placed at the price of $12.95. Profit of about $10.

Watching throughout the day. I noticed the checkout number at about 20 to only 2 orders so at about 3:30pm I dropped the shipping price to 9.99 thinking the price was the turnoff and didn't receive another order.

My ad hooked 161 from Instagram to at least go to bio and click link or click from story. I passed that hurdle with those people. 68 people saw the product, page, read the ad and proceeded to cart. 46 (48, but two ordered) saw the price and backed off.

As mentioned above. This is my first time drop shipping/marketing so I'm still very green but my assumption is the price still turned people off.

Could it be a bad product or a good product with terrible value perception? The item I was marketing could be had for 10-15 bucks, fairly easily.

I purchased two posts from this influencer so I'll be doing another ad, likely Wednesday. Any suggestions for better conversions? Should I lower the price a tad more? Give a little discount (10%?) on exit intent to convert those checkouts to purchases?

I do have a nice little list of customers now. Should I do anything with that to make them come back? Offer the product to them at a lower price for a limited time?

ecommerce,Magento or BigCommerce?,"Hello all. I'm looking for an honest feedback solution. I'm kind of torn between Magento and BigCommerce. I want to set up a B2C website that integrates with FBA or a different fulfillment service, an ERP and also have a B2B self service site. 

On the B2B side, I want to be able to create accounts for dealers (and them have their own portal) and have them log into my site to make purchase orders and see their price on a different sub domain aside from my regular domain. 

On the B2C side, regular customers would go there, order a product and the product would automatically be fulfilled by FBA or another service. 

I also want to sync my inventory with FBA if I use Amazon as a platform to sell on as well.

I love the ability to fully customize every aspect of the site and also host on a third party service such as bluehost so I will be able to have full control over databases, etc. 

I'm selling my own products but will eventually get into drop shipping as well and I feel like Magento is the answer.
