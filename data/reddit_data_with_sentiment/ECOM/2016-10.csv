ecommerce,Simplify Commerce transactions no bill to name or card number,"Hey r/ecommerce,
Question here. I'm using woocommerce + simplify commerce to run an RC parts store. 2 of my last orders have been over $500 and shipping addresses are freight forwarders on the East Coast of the U.S. Luckily I checked and cancelled the orders before shipping. The ship-to names are ""Vldric cire"" and ""nhorl gbin"", to me these look made up. The email addresses are both in the format ""firstname.lastname@aol.com"", probably also just made up in order to get order confirmations. IP addresses were from VPN providers in New Jersey and Virginia. As fraud prevention I'm utilizing the only two tools simplify commerce offers which is AVS verification and CVC verification and every order gets approved.

How can a credit card processor approve this? Simplify does not even ask for a billing name which seems really silly to me. I have no visibility of the billing name or card number, so I have to rely on them. Luckily it's the slow part of the year, but I could easily seem letting one of these bad orders slip through.

shopify,"Shopify - Looking for help with ""SOLD OUT"" text change","[Website](https://www.thelittlemarket.com/)

We recently changed the copy on our product pages and collection pages for products that said ""SOLD OUT"" to say ""WAITLIST"". Those changes were successfully made in the product.liquid file (line 115), and the product-listing.liquid file (lines 46 and 50). 

However the issue is that we have a handful products that are one-of-a-kind, which we want to keep the copy as ""SOLD OUT"" for, because they will never come back into stock. Those products are uniquely identified in the Shopify product pages with the tag ""bis-hidden"".

This is where I'd like to call on some advice. What is the best way to start driving traffic, which doesn't require a hefty marketing budget? Obviously I'm not expecting thousands of clicks with a small investment, but I want to get my brand name out there and start making sales.

ecommerce,"Starting my first niche ecommerce store (Shopify) and have a lead gen of 250,000+ organic people daily on Facebook. How can I leverage this?","I'll try to be as transparent as I can, but the question mostly deals with how you think I can leverage this niche lead gen on Facebook with my store, being based off of it.

So, I have no interest in this particular niche but it seems so untapped/unsaturated and given my unfair advantage (having a friend who runs a very successful, niche-specific, non-monetized Facebook page with nearly 400,000 followers and close to **2 million** organic FB users reached *weekly*) I'm looking to work with him and create a store around this niche. I've done thorough research and have a good understanding of the community and how to reach the demographic even without my friend's FB page. 

My friend is not interested in taking a stake in my store, but is willing to promote it with no discretion (his own moral values - goes along with the niche actually lol)

My idea is that I would create blogs that my friend would post as an indirect way to redirect people over to the Shopify site, but also in some FB posts be completely blunt and offer some sort of ""discount code"" to a particular product (or all) and a link to the store.
_________________________________________

**Slightly off-topic info:**

The niche, very very vaguely, is spirituality. My overall budget is going to be about $400 to, at most, $500 across the board to begin with. I'll be doing dropshipping via Aliexpress. I'll be selling multiple products - not a one product shop.

ecommerce,Ads for E-commerce store (Facebook + Google Adwords),"Hello redditers,

I've recently started my shopify stores and just wanted to hear some of your stories/experiences with google adwords and facebook and share mine as well.

So my store sells clothing &amp; accessories and approximate profit per unit is ~$10-$15.

And my main question is how can someone make profit using google adwords and facebook ads?
Adwords ask $0.58 per click! My conversion rate is 4-5%, let's do the math here - 100 clicks would be $58, lets be generous here and lets say I would make 5 sales which equals to $50-$75, Out of best possible situation I can make profit $17. let's be realistic here that probably won't happen every time, maybe 1 out of 10.

So is there something I'm missing? How do people actually make profit from google adwords? It's just sounds impossible?

The CPC from facebook is approximately the same and I just can't figure it out.

So many people are telling how great are facebook ads and google ads, I can't believe all of these people are charlatans, can someone make this clear for me?

Hope to hear some good stories.",12,9,2016-10-03,ECOM,0.03863457217812538,0.9159646034240723,0.04540085420012474

ecommerce,Buying out a partner for e-commerce biz ; advice please,"Hello, I was in business myself for e-commerce. Things were fairly new still (six months) and I did everything solely (management, funding, etc). I met a fashion blogger who seemly had connections according to her, money to chip in and an audience. She expressed great interest in partnering up and after a few sessions of speaking with her, I agreed. We decided to ""dissolve"" the other site, as it was still fairly new and had not gained too much traction and completely rebrand.

Initially I noticed things were a bit off (I'm finally being honest about my role as well for ignoring early signs). For example, when filing for the LLC, she did not want to give me her information (last name, ssn, etc). She wanted to use her ""blog name"". I told her that wouldn't be possible for legal paperwork. I planned on being as fair as possible, with me owning 52% of the business, although I received advice it should be at least 70% that I owned. But none of that came to light. Because to this day, my name is on everything (wholesale license, LLC, DBA, bank accounts, emails, etc) solely and hers is on nothing.

As time progressed I noticed I did ALL of the work. She does nothing. If she notices something needs to be completed, she will send an email or text me. We are unable to make connections or attend trade shows. There have been several other bloggers that have expressed interest in wearing our product, yet she has literally thrown a tantrum not wanting to give them inventory because she ""doesn't like them"", which is absurd. She did not want to attend the last the tradeshow because her husband takes her to Ibiza every year. February is also out because its around Valentines Day, of course. (Which is crazy!) One of her jobs is to post the clothing on her blog and social media. 4 times of of 10 she does. Or sometimes its only her blog and not social media. She enjoys meeting up twice a month. Initially I was fine with it, but started becoming aggravated when I realized she enjoys sitting around speaking about the latest episode of Gossip Girl and it doesn't help that I am expected to drive more than 40 miles to her, and she can never do the same for me. Skype, Google Hangouts and Conference Calls are out of the question for her. She refuses. She wants to feel like she is a ""Girl Boss"" meeting up, dressed in the latest fashions, over coffee, laptop in hand. (sarcasm!) But as I stated, she does NOTHING. Has never checked emails, has never shipped a package, has never posted on the business social media, has never worked on the website, etc. Has no clue honestly how anything works, or even wants to learn it seems.

All of this, I tried to take in stride and I continued to work hard. It has been tugging at me some time now that I probably shouldn't work with her anymore, but it has finally come to a head within the last month. She has refused to give any money for new inventory, until she's ready. She pays back money in increments. She cites that she is not trusting and feels I don't do anything. Mind you, I do 99% of the work. These sort of things come up because we have not grossed 1million in sales so far. Although she does not work, does not attempt to learn to work, etc. She also gets angry if I am unable to post for a third time on social media, because I am busy with my full-time job, while she is has no other employment and could post herself. So thats when she says these sort of things to me.

***I know there seems to be a lot of holes in the story, but I've already typed so much and I don't want to irritate anyone with my long thread.

I know I can no longer work with this person. What can I do? I received advice that I do not have to buy her out, since her name is on nothing and I am not legally obligated. I have also received advice to speak with a lawyer to draw up papers to give her all the money she has given me. And fyi it's been three months. :-/

ecommerce,Looking to partner with someone to relaunch an commerce website selling my brand of mens accessories,"Hi All

I am looking to find a partner with ecommerce experience to help me build/rebuild our ecommerce site and market it properly online. I have a very commercial brand of Mens accessories, timepieces, writing instruments and jewellery. We do well over 1 million USD turnover wholesale annually but we have almost no online presence or sales at the moment. Neither myself or anyone in our company has any online experience in marketing or running an ecommerce store. I assure with the right partner we could build a good level of business online in a relatively short time (with zero marketing we have sold over 20K USD just by having a shopify site.) 

What I propose is a model where we hold all of the stock, handle all of the logistics and shipping and an outside partner (you) handles the marketing and the management of the online store. In this way we have all of the stock risk and logistics overheads and all you have to commit is your time and expertise. 

I am open on how to handle this as long as its not a by way of me paying a salary (We cannot commit to employing anymore staff at the current time). My preference would be as a profit share from online orders, the percentage of which is negotiable. I am looking for a serious partner who is willing to commit the hours necessary to establish the online business. 

If you are interested please Message me or leave your details below along with a short description of your skills, experience and any similar business you have been involved in before. From there I will contact you via email or skye so we can discuss a business plan in more detail.

ecommerce,Amazon's New Review Policy,"Hi guys,

So this week was going to be the start of my venture into the world of private label selling on Amazon. You know the deal, find a niche white label and drop ship.

Like many of you I'm looking to work hard and quit my day job through starting a business. 

But since Amazon have banned getting discounts for reviews I've started to question if this would be the right kind of business to go into or at least is it the wrong time? How can anyone compete with existing sellers who were allowed to game the review system?

So my questions are: 

Has Amazon's new rules made it too difficult to get started private labelling on say a budget off $2,000? If not how would you advise getting round the not being able to ask for reviews issue?

Is it possible to sell on Amazon without having those initial reviews?

Any thoughts would be much appreciated as I'm a total noob.

shopify,Question: Looking to use Shopify for a web store that sells physical items as well as ongoing events and have a few questions.,"Hi!

I'm looking into Shopify for a client and trying to see if it's a good fit.

1) Client sells normal physical items as well as ongoing weekly events. Is there any way to set up an event as a product with a calendar to select dates from? The only way I can accomplish this that I see is setting up a product with ""date"" as a variant. Which will have to be constantly updated to reflect current events, since 52 dates in the drop down would be pretty overwhelming. 

2) Once an event is purchased, is there any way to integrate this with a booking or calendar app, like Bookeo or something? This way client can track total amount of sales/attendees for certain events based off of Shopify sales?

3) Planning on having a calendar on the client's site. We were going to link from the dates of these reoccuring classes to the Shopify product entry for that specific class. Is there any way to automatically have a variant selected when linking from a certain place? I don't want to create a product entry for every single class and if possible I'd rather the user not have to click on the calendar for a certain date, then be taken to the Shopify site and have to re-select the corresponding date.

Can't believe Shopify doesn't account for this. Thanks for any help!",6,5,2016-10-05,ECOM,0.02915148250758648,0.9408392310142517,0.030009305104613304

ecommerce,eCommerce platform and website for a manufacturing company - Open Source?,"Hello!

Forgive me if this isn't the exact subreddit for this subject, it just seemed like the users here might have the best opinion on the matter.


I have recently been promoted to a lead marketing position for our company which will include a relaunch of our website.  Our current website is an eCommerce store with all the basics:  catagories, featured products on front page, search bar, a carousel (I hate it), about us pages, etc.  It truly features nothing special that any other typical eCommerce store doesn't already offer.


***The irrelevant (but possibly relevant) part of the story:***

We are a very unique company.  We specialize in manufacturing and are not just a re-seller.  Our website features our products with a few exceptions.  Our products are one of a kind or have essentially helped build an entire industry from copy-cats.  It's extremely flattering!  However since the beginning the company was only run by 2 people - the owners - and everything was handled in house by only them.  They easily worked 80+ hours a week and had difficulty keeping up with... image?... in the industry.  Companies that had more employees and more money were able to make our company easily forgotten.  It was like this from 1999 to 2012 until they decided to shit or get off the pot:  hire or sell.  They hired!  This is the unique part:  they hired all family members with qualifications that fit in different places.  Our company is now 15 members strong and is entirely family.  I feel like it is time to reclaim our place in this industry... we're not unimportant or lesser, we've just lacked marketing.


I want our website to emphasize our uniqueness.  I want our website to showcase our products.  Not just an online store but as being a part of who we are.


***The real question starts here:***

Am I allowed to link examples?  If so here are some websites that really speak to me and inspire what I'm looking for:  (I'm really sorry if this breaks a rule, these really are the whole point in the post)

* https://www.nitewatches.com/us/
* https://www.onnit.com/
* http://www.apple.com/

These websites make their products look like their passion.  They want the customer to learn their product and believe in it not just add it to their cart.  We have a dealer network and also sell retail but we could honestly care less who the customer purchases the product from as long as our company was able to give them the information and education to feel confident in their purchase.


But I don't know where to begin as far as how these websites were able to achieve their look.  The current lead eCommerce platform I'm looking at has flashy looking graphics and specializes in our industry but when it comes down to it: it's just a revamped version of a basic online shopping cart.


Do I need to be looking at something more open source and thus a lot more in depth and costly?  I ran some chrome extensions to help see what platforms these websites were using but I'm still kind of a newb and didn't recognize what I saw.  I'm very willing to spend hours studying and doing this right before making any moves, I just want to make sure I'm on the right track for my goals. 


Please, any help with what platforms I should be looking at to achieve the look I'm after would be very helpful.  I just need a helping hand to ensure I'm going down the right path!",6,5,2016-10-12,ECOM,0.03213654085993767,0.9251652359962463,0.042698245495557785

ecommerce,What has been your most effective method of marketing for views + conversions?,"Hi everyone! 

I've used shopify in the past and they had a plugin for pinterest buy buttons. I would say I received a lot of traffic + conversions from that plugin. 
I've since moved to wordpress + woo commerce and soon after realized there was no such plugin for the buy buttons any more. I still post on pinterest, but for some reason I no longer receive traffic from them. 
I am active on social media as well and I receive traffic from instagram, but it never ends in conversion. 
I've also used influencers in the past, which DOES gives views to the site, but it's a bit underwhelming to shell out hundreds just for views (I've only received a few sales from one blogger, but she's very expensive to use...so it wasn't worth spending 300 bucks for a sale of three shirts).

I'm launching a new business called semmi shoes, and I'm waiting on my photos to come in in a few weeks so I'm doing a kickoff labs promotion.

I have about 1.8k followers in Instagram so far, and I'm planning on letting the followers know about the Kickoff labs promotion and maybe running a few FB ads to an article or directly to the lander.

My unique proposition for joining the email list is to be notified exactly when the website launches - I'm calling it a secret launch - so you can get in and grab a pair before my first batch of shoes runs out. Secondary is the opportunity to earn discounts by referring people.

So, I'd like you guys to review my two landers, which I will be running a split test on, and my thank you page. Any thoughts and tips are appreciated.

ecommerce,"Built a 6-figure/yr business using crowdfunding, lots of people asking how. Are you interested? [xpost from /r/entrepreneur]","What's up dudes and dudettes!

Early last year, I launched an ecommerce brand after getting some awesome advice from people [right here on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/2p6zm6/codequill_notebooks_sneak_peak_suggestions/). Not long after that, I launched a crowdfunding campaign to get even more validation from a broader audience, and get the funds I needed to turn this idea into a full-fledged business.

Now, the business has grown to be a 6-figure business, and we've been growing nicely month over month :)

I've gotten a lot of PMs, emails, strange text messages, and even a visit to my apartment (wtf?) by people who want to know how to do the same. 

Don't get me wrong, I made about 4,125,098 mistakes along the way, but that's only made it more obvious how building your own ecommerce business is not *that* hard, **IF** you have the ingenuity and discipline.

Having spent a crap-ton of time giving advice to people one-by-one, I figured now would be a good time to see if I should package up the strategies, tools, and processes I used to take my ecommerce brand from a small crowdfunding campaign to profitable, 6-figure ecommerce business in a year. 

But, before I go all bonkers on creating this program/course/whateveryouwanttocallit, I want to make sure that people give enough of a shit :P 

With all that being said, I'd be happy to put together a free, short course to help people launch their own ecommerce business using crowdfunding. Would you awesome fellas and fellitas (what?) be interested in a series like this that's sent to your inbox?

&lt;3

P.S: Any and all feedback is welcome! If you hate everything about it, please let me know. I'll be a little sad, but I'll still love y'all. Maybe.

ecommerce,Is this product priced correclty? Why is the market price so high?,"I'd like to venture forth into the realm of ecommerce, but my first step into the fray is met by confusion over pricing.

&amp;nbsp;

I inherited more than several brand new fingerprint-reading keyboards:

[This particular keyboard](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-58714)

And am trying to sell them through amazon at $89.99 each. This seems reasonable if one only considers a naive search for the price of the same product:

[Market Prices For the Same keyboard](https://www.google.com/search?q=ibm+fingerprint+keyboard&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1PRFI_enUS713US713&amp;espvd=2&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=745&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWiNbavuLPAhUF2D4KHXBZAk0Q_AUICCgB&amp;dpr=1#spd=0)

I listed the keyboards 2 weeks ago, and have not had a single sale.  I'm not surprised, as this is the only product I'm trying to sell, I have no reviews, and there are many cheaper, newer substitutes for this particular item.  In addition, the product itself has a rating on amazon that leaves something to be desired.  

&amp;nbsp;

  I would be willing to sell this item for less--in fact, I'd lowered the price to $69.99 for a week, and to no avail--but am not in a terrible rush to do so.  I think it would benefit me to garner some ratings on amazon first through other means.  

&amp;nbsp;

  I can't help but wonder **why the going price continues to be so high**.  This is the primary source of my curiosity, since there are (in my opinion) superior alternative substitutes that would come up in a search well before this ageing fingerprint reading keyboard.  My guesses range from  

*established merchants can more easily sell this product*

 to  

*established sellers are simply holding this one product among many in their inventory, and don't concern themselves with adjusting the price*

&amp;nbsp;

  In any case, your insight on this last bit would be much appreciated, so thanks in advance!",5,4,2016-10-17,ECOM,0.023480895906686783,0.9119283556938171,0.06459072977304459

My company's ecommerce app has been up and running for about 6 months, and we are trying to put together some case studies/testimonials to help (A) increase trust, (B) use as marketing collateral, and (C) reinforce our strengths.

We were thinking of creating 60-90 second video testimonials with some of our clients (1 per video). I was wondering if anybody in the community had suggestions for:
-Things they like to see in videos like this
-Formats that work
-Sensitive things to avoid
-Good examples to check out
-What would help convince them to try a service after watching a testimonial.

Thanks in advance for all the help!

woocommerce,Using Tickera and Bridge via Woocommerce,"Hello folks,

I was wondering if anyone has any experience with Tickera and using it via Woocommerce?

Looking to sell tickets for an event that is daily for a couple of months and has tickets for different time slots during that day. 

There will be a limit of places for this event at any given time slot.  

There will also be adults / kid tickets and they will be purchased by the day. 

SO I was looking at adding the tickets as a variable product in woocommerce which is fine but if I set a stock limit on a variable product (say 50) then there are still 50 available for other variations of that product. 

so i can have only 50 people at anyone time slot but if I put 50 for adults and 50 for kids potentially I could sell 100 tickets for that time slot. 

Can this be controlled at a higher level? 

Pretty new to this lark so if anyone has any pointers please do let me know!

ecommerce,What's turning people away from my website's checkout?,"Basically, if you read the recent post made by another user called 'Shopify Marketing? Zero Sales', well my situation is the same. 

Here is my website: [Hubblewear.com](https://Hubblewear.com)

I've spent over $70 in Facebook Ads, to my own knowledge I have been as specific as it can get when it came to 'Custom Audience' targeting; differentiating between women, men and both, targeting people who have expressed in interest in online shopping, t-shirts, clothing, NASA, Space, Hubble Space Telescope etc. and targeting those who lived in countries that had a space agency.

My very first successful ad spanned over the duration of 3 days, paying $7 each day. I reached a lot of Facebook Users, 81K to be precise and made 265 conversions (3 Added to cart, 1 Initiated Checkout, 4 Searched, 257 Viewed). Once could say that this was a very successful ad in terms of conversions and reaches.. just not sales. 

Next Ad (Still ongoing right now) spanned also 3 days and paid $7 for each, as of now has reached 24K and made 157 conversions. Atleast 7 people have initiated checkout.. but they haven't actually paid.

I have no idea what is turning the user away during checkout? Thus why I came on here to ask you guys to go onto my website as a customer, add a product to your cart as a customer, then proceed to the checkout as a customer (Don't actually buy something, unless you do like these wonderful tees :P) and tell me from a customer's viewpoint; what may turn you off.

And perhaps any other tips on how to properly target audiences on Facebook.",22,7,2016-10-19,ECOM,0.029973920434713364,0.9255180954933167,0.04450798034667969

ecommerce,Best eCommerce platform for our needs,"Hi!

I am trying to figure out what the best platform would be for my Mom's mid sized(1000 listed products) bedding and home business. She is currently an eBay seller, but for many reasons we want to transition to a stand alone store. 

I am her daughter, and have been tasked with figuring everything out and getting the site up and running, and eventually being able to hand it off to her, and her two business partners. 

I started with Magento, because my older brother is a lead developer, and has his own company with it. Magento had all I needed, but has a pretty complicated interface that I am not sure will be easy enough to teach my Mom and her partners. The store also didn't have a great aesthetic look to it. When I asked my brother if there was a way to make it look nicer he said, ""yea, pay someone 20k to design it""... and that is not a possibility. 

So I am moving away from Magento. 

I made a dumb move of trying WIX first, since it is what I use for my portfolio website. It does not have the functionality that we need. 

The biggest thing it lacks is filtered searching. I think that would be the term.. What I mean is the ability to search for all queen bedding, then search inside that search for all red bedding, and inside that search all cotton bedding.. and so on until you were viewing only red cotton queen bedding. 

With the many different brands and styles of the products, searching is very important. 

We were looking at BigCommerce, but that seem pricey. Any suggestions would help!

Please note, I am not trained in website development or admining(I have a degree in 3D animation, so I know computers and some scripting, but nothing to do with webdesign stuff)

ecommerce,"Good platform to base a small shop on, with only a few items but every item is customized with a photo from the buyer?","Cross posting my question from /r/webdev because I really want to get started this weekend.

Hey there. I'm setting up a shop for my small business where I sell items that are customised with a photo the user uploads.

Imagine a site that sells a couple of different sizes and colours of Tshirt, and you can upload (and position, crop, and zoom) a photo to have printed on it. It's not Tshirts, but it's basically that same idea.
I've already built the image editor in JS/HTML and it works (it currently saves the image by POSTing to a PHP page that stores the image on my server). But I need something better than just the ""buy now"" PayPal buttons we have now.

I need a shopping cart and a payment system that can integrate with these custom photo items, and might need options for different shipping tiers etc. I don't mind changing out the image editor if there's an appropriate off-the-shelf one, but mine has pretty specific requirements and works okay. The higher level this is and the more that's handled for me, the better. Geo-location for pricing would be cool.

So I was thinking about using Shopify - an end to end solution is great - but they seem to host the entire site and I don't see a way to integrate my item editor so that people can add their photo.
I was considering using OpenCart with PayPal or Stripe, since I still host the actual shop myself, but I'm not sure if there's an easier or more appropriate solution. Magento? WooCommerce? PrestaShop?

I understand there'll be some custom coding, that's fine. I'm happy to work hard on this, but I want to work hard on the right approach. The less there is for me to screw up, the better. I'm not even sure if my payment platform and my shopping cart should be the same or not.

Any suggestions would be great. Thanks!",1,2,2016-10-22,ECOM,0.03041965328156948,0.9193359017372131,0.05024450272321701

I suppose I am looking for a list of alternatives like Ebay and Jet.com. Specifically, market places that are good for a private labeled products. Ease of set up and restrictions to selling would also be a factor. As well as the market size. 

Does anything come close to Amazon?

ecommerce,Amazon PL selling in the U.K doesn't work?,"Hi guys,

I posted a thread about a week ago about trying to follow the Amazon private label, Jungle Scout style method and apply it to the U.K market. (In a nutshell, buy a niche product from Alibaba and sell it on Amazon).

First off, I wanted to say thanks for your help and thoughts and in the spirit of wantrepreneur Wednesday, I have a bit of a follow-up. 
A few of you guys mentioned it would be handy for me to post more specific metrics on why it doesnât seem to work.

I thought if I do this and if youâd be kind enough to spare a moment, you can help me to realise if Iâm being an idiot (likely) or if the private label bootstrap jungle scout thing just doesnât work in a U.K market.

While the example below is only for one product, I have tried it with 5 different carefully researched niche products and produced similar results.

I should say my starting budget is $2,500. Which I know isnât a lot, but Iâve read many a thread stating it can be done for under $1,000 so I figured (perhaps wrongly) it could be done.

Also, Iâve kept the costs in dollars for convenience.

Thanks,

Cost of niche product - $5

Number of pieces â 142 = $710

Selling price on Amazon - $18

Air shipping cost - $300

Insurance - $40

Customs Charges - $450

Tariff / Import Duty â 4.7% = $71

20% VAT = $220

Total postage cost to customers for all 142 pieces = $860 (seems most sellers offer free postage, so Iâm adding this as an outgoing cost to me).

Total Amazon referral fee cost (for all items sold) = $383

Total Amazon per item sold fee (for all items sold) $142

Total Outgoing costs = 3194

Total Profit = -$638",3,5,2016-10-26,ECOM,0.03101588785648346,0.9204294681549072,0.048554711043834686

ecommerce,Possibly fraudulent international orders?,"About a month ago I received an international order that was flagged by Shopify as possibly fraudulent. I did my due diligence and it seemed to check out, so I processed the order. Since then I've had over $10,000 in online orders from the same town/region in that country, all from different users, addresses, and credit cards. 

(To put that number in context, before this month my online sales were 5-10% of my total sales. This month, they're 50%, and it's all driven by these international orders.)

Some are flagged, some are not. When orders are flagged, I always email the user to confirm information, and if they get back to me, I ship the order.

The users always pay extra for expedited and tracked shipping, so I have full visibility while it's in transit.

I'm concerned because in the last few days the orders have increased in frequency and dollar amount. Just today I had an order come through for almost $1400 - by far the largest online order I've ever had (the average price point in my shop is $300). I worry that the credit cards could be stolen (they're different CC numbers but always AmEx) and I'm going to be hit with chargebacks later, and now that the orders are ramping up, that's a huge chunk that I'd have to pay back if that's the case.

On the other hand, maybe someone in that area loved my shop and told all their friends? Too optimistic?

Has anyone seen something similar? Should I simply cancel any potentially fraudulent orders, even though the customers are replying to my emails?

I'm also looking at what's bringing them to my site - it's always google or yahoo (not helpful).

1. Your business orders your products from a supplier, eyeballing how much to get of each product
2. Your business stores your products in your warehouse or other storage facility
3. A customer places an order with your online business
4. Your business receives the order
5. Your business packages and ships those products to your customer
6. Your customer receives the products they ordered
7. Your business continues to store any extra inventory that isnât sold
.

With a drop shipper, however, the purchasing process looks more like this:

1. A customer places an order with your online business
2. Your business passes the order information onto the drop shipper, which has all the products in its storage space
3. Your drop shipper packages and sends products directly to your customer
4. Your customer receives the products they ordered

Thus, drop shipping is a way for your business to avoid stocking your own products while still being able to fulfill customersâ orders with the help of a supplier.
.

What are the benefits of drop shipping?

The main benefit of drop shipping is that it frees your business from the costs, effort and time of storing, packaging and shipping your own products. However, thatâs not all it has to offer. Here are some additional benefits of drop shipping:

 

Saves money

By using a drop shipper, you and your business are able to cut a number of typical business costs. For example, drop shippers often get a better shipping rate than a small-to-medium business could get on their own. Furthermore, you can reduce losses from products damaged in transit because the products are taking a more direct route.

 

Minimizes risk and waste

Without a drop shipper, businesses have to take big risks when they buy their inventory. Itâs almost impossible to predict trends and tastes, or whether that new product line will really take off or just take up storage space. With drop shipping, thereâs no excess inventory or under-ordering. Since all the products are with the supplier, youâll have exactly as many as your customer ordered.

 

Increases inventory variety

Drop shipping can effectively increase the variety of products your online business sells by giving you access to both specific niche products and popular best-sellers. Plus, your business is no longer limited by product aspects such as size or perishability.

 

Allows for more business flexibility

When drop shipping frees your business from storing products, youâre free to locate your business almost anywhere. Anywhere thereâs an internet connection is now fair game. And since you donât have to worry about storage space, itâs also very easy to scale your business.

 

Proven to work

While it has gained in popularity with the growth in online business, drop shipping is a tried and true practice used by successful businesses for decades.  From  huge retailers like Zappos, to many small-to-medium Volusion stores, drop shipping can be a great asset to your online store.

How do I find a drop shipper?

So youâve decided to use a drop shipper, but donât know where to start looking for one. Luckily, you have one of your best allies at your fingertips: the internet. Here are three major ways to figure out your drop shipper options:

 

1. Search online

If youâre like most people nowadays, this option came to mind immediately. Simply go to your favorite search engine, type in âdrop shippers,â and done, right? Unfortunately, finding a drop shipper is a little more difficult than your average search. Drop shippers tend to have very poor SEO marketing campaigns, as well as typically less-than-impressive web design. However, it is possible to find a good drop shipper through search. You just have to be persistent.

Pros: No extra cost, youâll be very knowledgeable about your options by the end.
Cons: Takes a lot of time and effort.

Some extra tips when searching online:

The best drop shippers may not show up on the first couple pages. Try digging deep, like pages six through 10
Expand your search terms from âdrop shippingâ and âwholesaleâ to include other terms like âdistributor,â âbulk,â âreseller,â âwarehouseâ or âsupplierâ
In addition to using typical search engines, donât forget to visit pages like yellowpages.com and search for the terms listed above
 

2. Try paid directories

Because it can be difficult to find drop shippers through search alone, websites have cropped up that have extensive lists of drop shippers, but can only be accessed at a price. In addition to the cost, many of these directories are suspect. Legitimate directories do exist, but be aware that many of these sites are full of outdated links and drop shippers that are out of business.

Pros: More convenient, less time spent searching.
Cons: Cost, moderate to high risk of encountering a scam.

 

3. Use alternative drop shipping websites

There are other websites that are a mixture of directory and drop shippers themselves. Doba is a good example of this. These websites are often more legitimate, but come at a higher price than your average paid directory website.

Pros: Get a variety of drop shippers to choose from, convenience.
Cons: Higher cost.

 
.

What should I know before choosing a drop shipper?

As you will see, there are plenty of options for drop shippers. Do ample research on what each drop shipper provides, and determine which one best fits your specific business needs.

Here are some questions you should ask before deciding on a specific drop shipper:

 

How long have they been in business?

Drop shippers have a reputation for going in and out of business fairly quickly, so a fresh face is far from ideal. Instead, choose a veteran drop shipper with a proven record of trustworthiness. Typically, the longer theyâve been around, the better, with a good benchmark being 10 years or more.

 

Who do they use for shipping?

Make sure that the drop shipper you choose is using a legitimate and capable shipping company for maximum reach and stability, as opposed to a small shipping company thatâs just starting out.

 

Do they ship internationally?

Though you may not be selling internationally yet, if youâre even open to the idea doing so one day, youâll want to make sure that international shipping is an option.

 

Who else do they work with?

Get an idea of who else is using the drop shipper and figure out where your company falls in their mix of clients. Ideally, your company will fall in the middle, since being the largest risks the drop shipper not being able to keep up, and being the smallest may end up in your business being overlooked.

 

Do they offer custom packing materials?

Being able to customize your shipping labels and packing slips means you can make sure that products will show up on your customersâ doorsteps with your branding on the box. Plus, having control over the packing slips means you can include things like coupon codes or customer service phone numbers.

 

Do they send order notification emails?

If your drop shipper sends order notification emails to your customers, then thatâs one less thing youâll have to keep up with when processing orders. This can be a great way to save time and maintain quality customer service.

 

What is the drop shipperâs return policy?

Read the return policy closely to identify any specific fees or charges for processing returns. And make sure they update their records so you wonât have to cover the cost of the returned merchandise.

 

How much will you be paying?

Many drop shippers only have per order fees, but some also charge a âparticipation fee,â which can greatly drive up the overall cost. So be on the lookout for any hidden or additional fees.

 

How do they accept payment? What are their terms?

Itâs important to consider how flexible the drop shippers payment options are, and whether or not they fit with your business. And remember, sometimes payment options increase after a certain period of time or a specific number of orders.

 

What are others saying about them?

Whether theyâre doing a great job or a poor one, there should be no shortage of reviews on the internet. See what people are saying in forums, on social media and by word of mouth. And if you have any questions, contact the drop shipper and ask for references from companies theyâve worked with.",1,2,2016-10-29,ECOM,0.06516503170132637,0.905452162027359,0.029382833279669285

woocommerce,possible to link variations to other variations?,"Woocommerce allows linking 1 simple product to another simple product and you can link an entire variable product to another variable product, but **is it possible to link a variation in a variable product to another variation in another variable product?**

Simple example, I have 2 variable products:

* Jacket that comes in Red, Blue and Green
* Matching Gloves that come in Red, Blue and Green

When I'm viewing the tshirt and select the Red variation, I want to see a recommendation that you can also buy the matching Red gloves.

Different example:

* Flower pot that has the following diameters: 11"", 12"", 13""
* Flower pot hangers that come in sizes: 12"", 13""

When viewing the 12"" pot, I want it to recommend the compatible 12"" hanger. Same idea for 13"", but 11"" doesn't have a hanger, so it doesn't recommend one.

As a temporary fix, I built a custom shortcode that I use in the variation description which will display a simple link to the product. For example:

    Compatible with [product_url sku=""123-456""]

But it's too simple looking. I would prefer to have it display similar to how related or linked products are shown. Is there a way to do this out-of-the-box or maybe a third party plugin to do it? I would prefer not to build a custom plugin for this unless a solution doesn't already exist.

ecommerce,How do you compete with the big players?,"So I'm sure there is countless literature regarding this topic, but I would be very interested to learn both from your experience as a consumer and as an ecommerce business owner what you think.

If your e-commerce business sells third party items, how do you compete with the big players with the likes of Amazon and others, depending on the country you're in? So far, I know content marketing and great customer service certainly help but is it enough? Think about all these Amazon consumers who subscribe to Prime who can get anything delivered in a day. Why switch to a new store when you already know that you can find said items where you already shop and have the experience?

shopify,Probably an annoying question that comes up a lot 'I have many visitors per day but no sales',"Pretty much the case, 50-100 visitors per day since putting the store a week ago now but only sold 4 products (and those I think are more due to being promoted externally then shopify).

I read something about an tool that used to exist to review a product listing and make suggestions but doesnt look like its available anymore. Does anyone know where I can find a thing like that or maybe know someone who can just look at my shop listing and tell me what Ive done wrong?

It's just a charity calendar, there is a chance Im just too early (with October) but for breaking over 1000 visitors only 4 sales is pretty terrible to me. Or maybe its not and this is exactly how effective online stores are, I dont know :(

If anyone wants to give me their 2c then the product listing I'm most concerned about is just this:

dropship,Tax registration questions? Hosting? General questions.,"Hi, long time lurker here, but I want to try dropshipping among other things.  Problem is, I don't know if I must apply for business license.  I'm from Canada (Qc) but nearly all the info out there is for Americans.  

So I hope someone can help me here. 


* 1. Do I need any tax information if I want to import from AliExpress/baba? (which means do I have to register a business name with Canada)?
* 2. Can I do without?  For example, as if I'm buying many of the same products for myself - for testing out the concept?  
* 3. What if I end up having many different 'stores'?  If a tax id is necessary, do I have to register new companies for each? (I think in Canada it costs $200 per business registration).
* 4. Maybe some follow up questions later.

About hosting; say I go with shoppify, is hosting with them better or easier?  If not, who would you recommend?

I'll likely have more questions later too, but for starting off, I think those are the ones that I really need.  

Maybe a couple more last questions?  Since I am Canadian, would it be possible to get an american tax id. (if I need one). And would it be easier to sell with an American tax id?  The reason I'm asking is because I live in Quebec.  Everything has to be French first, English optional.  I have no problem with French, but the majority of the clients will be international, and more so English speaking.   

I read a few guides, and tips from Americans, U.k'ers, Isrealis, Brazilians and a Canadian or 2, but aside from 1 Canadian who already had a license to business, and an American with a registered LLC, nobody actually talks about registering the business or if it is even necessary.
