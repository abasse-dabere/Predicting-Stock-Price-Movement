I'm looking to launch a three product website (with color variations). One of my goals is to impliment a very lean multi-channel sales and fulfillment system.

ecommerce,Richard from A Better Lemonade Stand here. Considering adding a forum to my blog. Thoughts and opinions would be appreciated.,"Hey all, 

I know some of you are aware of my blog, for those that aren't it's www.abetterlemonadestand.com. 

I have been thinking about adding a forum to the blog that would specifically cater to people that are just about to launch their business, up to people 1-2 years into their business.

The goal would be to provide a resource for people to meet others in a curated environment. By curated I mean that I would personally chat with every applicant to make sure each person is bringing something to the table so the community as a whole becomes stronger. 

I understand that a forum is only as strong at the members and precipitation it receives so I would be devoting a lot of resources to building and cultivating this. 

I have been getting a few quotes to build out the forum and due to the cost, commitment and various other reasons like qualifying members, this would be a paid membership. 

I am aware and a member for the EcommerceFuel forum, however, he serves a higher end market of entrepreneurs that are already making a few hundred k/year. 

I would love your feedback on this. Specifically: 

- Does this interest you? 
- What can I do to provide you with massive value? 
- What price point do you feel is appropriate based on what I have told you so far?",7.0,6,2014-08-03,ECOM,0.01482425071299076,0.9160569310188293,0.06911880522966385

While focusing internationally will give you a larger market it also means more competition and it could be harder to stand out. Focusing nationally will mean smaller potential market but might make it easier to become a leader. This is my current thinking just wondering if anyone has comments and advice on this.

Choosing one or the other will affect choices like whether I'll register a .com domain or .ie domain, SEO strategies etc. Focusing nationally might be slightly easier SEO wise.

woocommerce,Searching product attributes with unsuccessful results...,"Edit: Subject should probably be ""Searching product variations with unsuccessful results..."" 

Sorry. 

Hello, I hope the subject isn't too vague. I am a total newb to wp and woocommerce. My site is like a cars.com but for surfboards. 

Here is a link to see what I am referring to...http://www.surfboarddatabase.com/all-products/?filtering=1&amp;filter_width&amp;filter_length=

My problem is this, a surfboard comes with specific dimension variations 5'6 x 19 x 2.25. Length x width x thickness/ feet x inches x inches. 

Here is my problem using arbitrary dimensions. Lets say you have 3 boards with 3 unique variations of the same mode board, 5'6 x 19 x 2.25; 5'7 x 19.25 x 2.38; 5'8 x 19.50 x 2.50. If a user is searching for a board that is 5'6 x 19.50 x 2.38, the search should yield 0 results. Does that make sense why? Right now the site is returning results when it shouldn't and I can't understand why. I have linked the attributes like 5'6 x 19 x 2.25 within the product data as variable product. I entered the dimensions as linked variations too. 

Am I organizing them incorrectly? Let me know if you need more information.

* there will be any number of available routes
* there will be 0-4 vouchers available on any route on any day (up to year into the future) each route page should have a calendar view (showing the current &amp; the next month)

I was wondering if you could point me into a right direction in terms of the most suitable woo-commerce plugins (free or commercial) with the required set of features.

* I'm guessing that something like event tickets (vouchers) with venues (routes) could work, but maybe I'm just over thinking and categories/tags (with something else) etc could work as well

From August 3rd to August 4th those numbers have dropped to .39% (mobile), 1.77% (desktop), and 1.96% tablet.  
Personally we are trying to trouble-shoot exactly what is causing the drop in the conversion rate, especially with mobile.  **If anyone is able to browse the site on mobile and try going through the check-out process it would be greatly appreciated since I only have one version of Android and it is impossible to check out all platform.** Specifically I have noticed issues with pressing the ""Add to Cart"" and ""Checkout"" button... they sometimes don't seem to work unless you press them  several times.

ecommerce,"Planning on building an audience then promoting products, should I use Shopify or Wordpress?","Hey guys,

Had a quick question, I'm very familiar with Wordpress but not as much as Shopify, especially when it comes to their content platform. What I was wondering is how the CMS and SEO of Shopify is versus Wordpress. I've ranked a lot before using Wordpress and it's my bread and butter but I'm really focused this time on building a blog where I can sell products too. I know Wordpress has WooCommerce and I've heard some good things and others is just okay. I think what sells me on Shopify is just the overall layouts and how simple it is to use. Also heard great things about their checkout options and being able to manage the back end shipping systems.

ecommerce,Product-Photo business idea for online stores. Would you use it?,"Hi everyone, 

I wanted to quickly get feedback and/or validate a online product-photo business. The business would market primarily to online companies that import products from china and resell online. Many of these companies don't have actual storefronts but rather they sell all online and use fulfillment services to ship. When these companies want to get product photos done it often means they have to pay for international shipping and then pay for local studio which costs lots of money and time. Or they do it themselves and it looks shitty.

Solution: Product Photography studio in China that you can send your product to for professionally done product photos (against a white backdrop or with props). This would not only be faster and cheaper than shipping to the states -- but also it would cost less than the price of a US studio.  So all of this, unless your product is huggge, would cost less than $500 (maybe a couple hundred total?). 

I can already have this business running tomorrow sans website. I was hoping to get feedback if this is something you think is needed and/or worth pursuing? I know I would use this because service because it's how I got photos for my business taken. Thoughts appreciated!",8.0,3,2014-08-06,ECOM,0.03775998204946518,0.929750919342041,0.0324891172349453

After weeks and many wads of wasted cash, I'm seeking some really urgent help for my WooCommerce based store.

ecommerce,How do you import a large text list of items to products? [opencart],"Hey what's up,

This is a really cool project I'm working on, I'm building a site that has a large list of downloadable songs, there are no product photos or sounds, just the song titles, and unlimited quantity.

- Option #1
I'd like to import the list of songs so a customer can search the title, find it and add it to the cart.
This would require adding all the songs to the products database, not sure if this is possible due to the large list of products it would create but it would be great. If this is possible, would need to know a way to get all these song titles in efficiently.

- Option #2
I could just have one item called ""song download"" and make it so the customer just adds it to the cart, and have an option where they can input the song title. I would still need to create a song list database so they can see what songs are available.

To summarize, I need to take a large list of songs in text format and add them to a searchable database so the customer can find them. Whether customers can add each song to the cart individually, or manually enter the song title as a product option, they still need to find the songs through a search.

Do you have any ideas for a solution?

ecommerce,[PODCAST],"Hey entrepreneurs,

Felix from [Shopify Masters](http://shopifymasters.org?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=forum_promo) back with another podcast.  Today's guest is Andrew Gardner from Polar Pen.  

Andrew Gardner tried and failed at a previous fundraising campaign because he chose a product he wanted, but once he started looking for products the crowdfunding community wanted, he hit gold.

Polar pens are the first modular pen made from magnets.

Andrew’s Polar Pen campaign started off with a modest goal of $14,000 CAD ($12,760 USD) to produce 2,000 pens, but by the end of the campaign Andrew raised over $800,000 CAD ($730,000 USD) to produce 20,000 pens.

To take advantage of the ongoing demand for the pens after his Kickstarter campaign, he opened up a Shopify store and took first place in one of the ten categories in Shopify’s Build a Business 2014 competition.

This podcast episode is perfect for you if:

1. you want to learn more about crowdfunding (like Kickstarter)
1. your products require a demo video
1. you sell your products internationally
1. you want to learn more about selling your product before it’s made (pre-selling)

ecommerce,"Long Time Redditor, Went on a Limb and Joined a StartUp For Ecommerce Companies add LiveChat with Texting support.","Note: I apologize if this is inappropriate and will remove if it is.

Hey guys, I'm John Weber, and I recently left a nice Fortune 100 company to help build a startup.  Our startup is called [ChatBlend](https://www.chatblend.com), and I'm the User Interface Architect (along with maybe 5 other hats).  We just got passed the first round of funding and are hoping to get some customers to get our 2nd round.

The LiveChat platform is (admittedly) barebones as we're still developing it, what we really wanted to focus were two things:

1) Give your website a texting number (right along side your phone/fax number) that customers can text your company for Sales or Support.

2) Run ChatBlend from a computer, tablet or phone.  This is where I come in.  It's a fully responsive app (Which you can see on the homepage).

I just wanted to see if anyone would be interested in the idea and maybe testing it out.  It's free for two weeks, has unlimited texting plans, and we can do a one-on-one demo to get you started.

Even if you aren't interested in the product, any criticism or comments would be entirely welcome. :)

If you haven't visited in a while, you may notice a few sidebar changes - rules have been made to try to keep spam at bay (at our users request) and so far that has been working.  The idea is that what posts we have should be quality and informative posts that facilitate conversation and ideas, not clickbait to get hits or promote someone's site or service.  On this I think we can all agree.  

PandaProphetess and I have shared quite a few ideas of late but we want your input.

We also want some databases that are easy for our subscribers to access - ecommerce platforms (we did an excellent one a while back), SEO services, open source solutions, and perhaps a database of users with experience in certain areas that can be called on to help those new to ecomm.

ecommerce,16 Year Old Start-Up,"When explaining the culture and the excitement I feel about joining Unilog, I often use the sentence, “I work for a 16 year old start-up!”
 
I joined Unilog Content Solutions as Senior Vice President, North America in January of 2014. Prior to joining Unilog, I had a long career developing and deploying technology solutions, specifically ERP solutions to distributors. Because of this experience and perspective, I have come to the realization that spending money on an ERP environment is not in the best interest of the distributor!
 
Most of the ERP environments sold today are architected in an era before the internet, and the people who enhance and maintain them have inherited the sins of the thought processes of software developers from the 1980’s!
 
I believe in today’s world distributors should be spending their technical dollars on content and e-commerce and that’s where I wanted to be.
 
After looking at industry associations and leaders in the e-commerce (omni-channel) space, one name continued to stand out as the leader at producing high-quality product content and the digital assets associated with this content. Unilog Content Solutions has a 16-year history of producing content for well-known suppliers, such as Grainger. The process of developing and delivering content is mature and the company is financially stable.
 
But there was another facet to Unilog Content Solutions that I found incredibly intriguing – a start-up arm in the US that promotes a software system (enterprise commerce platform) that will power omni-channel commerce (website and native mobile applications) specifically for distributors. I looked at the customers that have adopted CIMM2, interviewed them about their experience, and immersed myself in the product. I was so impressed, that I joined – the start-up arm of a 16 year old company!

woocommerce,[Advice?] Updating a huge amount of products,"After a bit of advice or possible pointing and booting in the right direction.  
I run a Woocommerce store on my website specializing in IT parts and equipment on a dropship style of service with a few items in stock for easier postage. At around 1200 products, updating and checking tends to be a slow and torturous procedure.  
The products are in a .csv, and using Allaerd's woocommerce importer (with custom fields addon) with a bit of tweaking in fields now comes to around 3-10 minutes per row/item and several wrong fields which aren't defined anywhere, even after setting the header up properly.. Stuff what aren't even enabled or in file appear to be applied to rows, yet changing them from published to draft produces 'changed from, to publish' on the output screen.  
Anyway, I'm looking at attempting to Automate this procedure so it doesn't take 6/7 hours to import everything now that more products are being added by supplier. Add into the mix that  I'm busy on customers sites obviously I want something quicker and easier.

woocommerce,Product Variation Limit?,"Hi all, I have a site I'm trying to fill up with some t shirt designs I am going to sell through Woocommerce.

ecommerce,Inventory management software and how it works?,"What do people normally use for inventory management? How do they normally work? 

I have a ~20000 sq ft warehouse and I am drafting up all assets for our catalog. We sell stuff for commercial kitchens. Some data I will have organized / using:
(List price/net price, UoM, Inner and Master Box Case, Special order only items, drop ship only items, overstock only items, pictures, spec sheets, list price, discount, product / inner/master UPC, net weight, gross weight, vendor FOB).

Will anyone enlighten me how this normally works? I want to sell certain items:

1. Items that we stock and can ship out same day. This will include overstock from smaller, less reliable vendors.
2. Items that we special order from large vendors. Basically since I'm putting $2000 orders from some of our distributors all the time, and can get it from their warehouse in a relatively fast time, I am going to effectively assume all of these items will be in stock and shipped in 3-7 days from our warehouse.
3. Items that are dropshipped only. These items are big things like commercial refrigerators. I don't really care to stock these. 

For stock items:

1. I will keep track of items manually, no UPC barcode tracking required. I will pull items from stock and only restock when overstock is used.  

2. For special order items, I want to be able to keep track of all items coming into our pallets and which ones go out. I want to be able to correlate a PO that we are making to the customer's invoices. 

I will be using an ecommerce CMS. I am leaning towards prestashop / magento but have not started any development because I have still drafting my catalog. I actually do not know how I am going to do my inventory management yet or how they will integrate with quickbooks / inventory management software.

In this catalog, I will have the following on our website:
1. Products identified by SKU's. Each SKU will have the following product data attached on our website:
A. UoM. Each item will be clarified as being sold individually, or by case packs. 
B. Price per UoM (unit of measure) 
C. UPC associated with UoM (for instance if i sell case packs only, UPC will be the inner case pack for the entire product)
For instance, I'll sell small things that people buy in bulk (spoons, knives, dishware) by a case pack UPC vs an item UPC. If I sell an item people normally buy one at a time, I'll sell them individually by an item UPC.
D. Any associated data (Pictures, images, spec sheets)

I already have a strong grasp on our market and what we are going to tailor our customers too. I know which items I want to sell based on our company's invoice records. 

So my question is, how does an inventory management software normally work? What are some software names I should look into? Where can I learn the fundamentals of how to manage all of this?

Does anyone have any ideas what data I should use (gross weight, net weight per item, product UPC / case UPC) for which applications?

I was wondering if some of you could explain how to best use landing pages in ecommerce.

Also, group buying sites and membership sites (like discount sites) use them too, but I'm not sure how that translates to regular ecommerce.

ecommerce,How do you verify / take payments on ecommerce stores for large orders ($1000 or more) and prevent chargebacks / fraud?,"How is this normally done by the way on an ecommerce platform? Basically say I'm selling a line of items to a customer and they decide to buy at least $1000 worth of things. Say that I have never worked with this customer before. How do I ensure that I do not get screwed over by a chargeback on a credit card or various other means? Having to ship an item worth $1000 or more is a serious risk investment imo. 

The way I understand it is the following methods:

Authorization of the end user first (Choice 1)

1. Utilizing an ecommerce platform (i.e. Magento), a customer registers for an account (enters in billing information, and shipping information)
2. Content management system does checks :
3. Billing information == shipping information, otherwise account is void
4. Do some form of database check with plugins in magento. **I don't know how this works**
5. Manually check information in databases,** I don't know how this works though**
6. Downside of this is that the end user must get approval of an account (pretty sure uline.com does this) before making an order. Most places go with alternative 2 to my knowledge. 


Alternative 2: 
Authorization of the user / order after the order is made. 

1. Customer orders all items, puts in shipping / billing information
2. Order / Account goes to a holding area in the ecommerce CMS.
3. Customer's order is approved by me (background checks take place here, manually or automated with plugins. Still don't know how this works)
4. Order is approved, we get the invoice, pack it, and ship out. 


Does anyone have good resource guides on how this works? Like a big picture infograph showing how this works with the banking companies, the end customer, our company, and any fraudulent database plugins? 

Also, what are all the ways a customer can get money returned? Is it just a chargeback on credit card, or is there more? What ways can you protect against chargebacks ($1000+ order worth of items).

ecommerce,I cannot sell outside Canada but 60-70% of my visitors are from elsewhere. What to do?,"Hi,

So I have been running my drop-shipping eCommerce (Shopify) site in a specific niche for about 6 months now. I exceeded 50k in revenues and I am expecting 100k this year.

My problem is only 20-25% of my visitors are from Canada and the rest are mostly from US and Europe. I cannot sell my product in the US since the brand I am selling is only doing business with one company in the US.

I tried to reach out to that company and suggested to redirect my visitors from the US to them in exchange of a percentage on the sales. They were not interested. 

 I get between 200 and 1000 visitors per day from my referrals only so it is why I get so many visitors from countries that I am not targeting. I am still trying to find a way to create another revenue stream without risking losing actual sales. I thought about putting ads but I am not sure if it's a good idea. My products' price are from 300 to $500. It is why I am asking for your opinion if putting ads on a website with high-end products is a good idea or not.

ecommerce,Your Ultimate Guide to USPs (Unique Selling Propositions),"A captivating USP can spell the difference between a thriving business and a stagnant one. Not only does it differentiate you from other service providers in your niche, but it also gives prospective customers a good idea of what to expect when working with you. Because of this, you need to develop the best possible USP for your business.

Before we delve into the nitty gritty of the concept of the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), let us first explain what it is.

Many business owners confuse their USP with their company slogan. However, there is a critical difference between the two.

To better illustrate what I mean, consider the following slogan a company might use:

*“Taking your business to the next level”*

That sounds like an amazing slogan, but it cannot be your USP because it does not help prospective customers understand exactly why they should choose to work with you over your competitors.

With the slogan above, many prospects probably end-up asking:

“How are they going to take my business to the next level?”
“Is this company going to help me finance my business upgrades?”

Confusing your prospect customers this way can be detrimental to your business’s success.

To better understand what a USP is, you must answer this question.

Why should a prospective customer work with you instead of your competitors?

If you can answer that in 10 or fewer words, then you’ll have your USP. Of course, your answer should be both unique and specific, and it should solve your customers’ problems the way your company does it. Your answer should be true to what your company stands for and the culture that you’ve established within your brand. Here are some examples:

SiriusXM – “180+ channels, commercial-free music”
BillFaster – “Professional invoices in 7 seconds”

In this guide, we’ll share with you a few tips that you can use to create your own USP and ultimately help you grow your business.

**USP Tip #1: Develop an Identity**

Your company’s vision should be clear to you and your target customers. You have to be able to show off your best asset in a single statement to attract people.
Go back to your company vision, goals, market strategies and business plans.  Define what your products or services are, enumerate your strengths, list areas that need improvement and know your target market.

By delving into the core of your business, you can market your offerings to your target audience. USP is one way of telling your customers what you do best. Your USP should make customers think:

“I want to know more. Show me more!”
“Tell me more about your products!”

You can only get such reactions from your customers when you fully understand what your company is about what you have to offer. If you can arouse curiosity, then you have captured your prospects’ attention, which will ultimately result in them purchasing goods and services from you. Such sales mean that people have gotten hooked on your USP, and that they’d like to scratch the surface of your proposition.

Here are some USPs that you can check out.

*1Bee’s Wrap – “The ‘new’ old-fashioned alternative to plastic wrap”*

The makers of this innovation understand their product’s uniqueness, as well as the health and environmental benefits of using their wrap instead of plastic wrap. They apply this effectively to marketing communications to capture the attention of their audience.
www.beeswrap.com

*2FedEx – “When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight”*

FedEx promises fast and reliable freight service, and guarantees that your package will arrive by a certain time. They clearly state this with their USP.
www.fedex.com

*3Huit Denim Co. – “Do one thing well”*

Huit Denim boasts that they do nothing more and nothing less than make high quality jeans. Because they focus on doing only one thing, they do it well.
www.hiutdenim.co.uk

*4Bellroy – “Slim your wallet without turning your world upside down”*

Bellroy knows that wallets carry people’s important items. Often, pockets become full and heavy with unnecessary items. Bellroy’s proposition? Slim wallets of top-notch quality. This is their asset, a product and a proposition no one has previously thought of.
www.bellroy.com

**USP Tip 2: Pay Attention to what the Market Wants**

USPs aren’t about you, but about your customers.

You might be able to provide a service better than your competitors, but without an attention-grabbing selling proposition, the market won’t even notice you.

Know what your target clients want and need, as opposed to what you can offer. Conduct surveys on the street and questionnaires on the Internet, and ask for a feedback from returning customers for a clear view of what people want.

Here are some samples from different companies:

Colgate – “Improve mouth health in 2 weeks”
Coastal.com – “Eyeglasses brands you love from $48”
Volkswagon –”Form meets function with a flair of simplicity. We design with a purpose”

Ask yourself how you can solve their problems and what methods you should use to do it the way they want to. You should be able to meet, if not exceed, their expectations. Customers should be your top priority if you want to beat the sales of companies who offer the same service.

5AmericanMusical.com knows that customers want ease of payment. They want to be able to buy something expensive with a payment plan that won’t shock their wallets. With what they are offering, musically inclined individuals will surely opt to purchase from them.
www.americanmusical.com

6LLBean.com’s USP offers something their competitors don’t. “Free shipping to US and Canada every day. No minimum order, no end date.” This attracts online buyers who prefer hassle-free shopping. The free shipping offer appeals to buyers because they can save money on their purchases.
www.llbean.com

7Low price? Well, Cymax.com has a price meeting program allowing buyers to choose a product at their desired price. Now that’s customer-centered selling!
www.cymax.com

8The Dollar Shave Club provides hassle free shaving with their membership program. Pay their monthly fee and have your razor delivered to your doorstep monthly.
www.dollarshaveclub.com

**USP Tip 3: Know what You Can Offer that Your Competitors Cannot**

Product exclusivity is one of the things that attract a wave of clients. If your product can beat the other products in the same aisle at the supermarket, then expect your sales to be booming. Likewise, if you can provide reliable service and a one-of-a-kind customer experience that makes your competitors eat dust, then clients are sure to switch to your company.

This is your asset, and you should use it to appeal to your target market. Emphasize why you, rather than any other company in the same segment, are the best choice to solve your audience’s problems.

Use distinctive words like:

Biggest
Best
Fastest
Only
Or offer them something they can’t refuse:

Money-back guarantee
If it’s late, it’s free
First month is free
Examples of this include:

Domino’s Pizza – “You get fresh, hot pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less — or it’s free.”
Accessory Geeks – “Create your own case now starting at $16.99”
Coastal.com – “Get your first pair of glasses free. Choose from over 300 frames”

Make sure you know who you’re competing against, and show-off the qualities that make you different. Do not boast about something everyone in the industry has, because that won’t make you stand out. In business, you shouldn’t brag about being the best; in a sea of companies claiming to be the best, that sort of claim gets no attention.

The way to stand out is to be unique, to do things differently, and to show this to your target market. Curiosity, packed with a persuasive USP and guaranteed customer satisfaction, is sure to sell your business.9SpreadShirt gives the t-shirt market an innovative twist by letting buyers create their own product and designs. These customizable ideas sell because of the uniqueness of the USP.
spreadshirt.com

10Pureformulas.com beats their competitors with the following USP: “Orders placed before 5 PM EST ship the same day.” This attracts clients who want to receive their purchases the same day.
www.pureformulas.com

11Best Buy not only dares to compete but also challenges to eliminate competitors with their USP. “Find a lower price and we’ll match it.” This defies the natural and challenges the usual.
www.bestbuy.com

12Watch Co.’s “365-day return policy” guarantees both customer satisfaction and the quality of its products.
www.watchco.com

**USP Tip 4: Craft a Compelling, Straightforward USP**

Your USP should be short and catchy. After all, its main purpose is to get the attention of your target market. A compelling USP should also be meaningful and straightforward. Eliminate any unnecessary words.

To give you an example, here are some commonly used USPs that do not successfully draw attention:

“We deliver your package, fast”
“We offer the best postpaid plans”
“Providing the best business coaching services”

Although these may state the company’s services and address customer issues, they do not stand out from the crowd. Give details as to why you are the best and why customers should buy from you, all the while keeping it short and catchy. Explain what your company can do for your customers, but capture your audience’s attention and make a mark while doing so.

Here are some good examples:

20Saddleback Leather – “They’ll fight over it when you’re dead.”

With the photo of their bag on a man with a machine gun, the quality they are trying to express is immediately obvious and over the top.
www.saddlebackleather.com


14Warby Parker’s home try-on program lets you order online and try these at home. No more worries with whether your online purchases will suit you or not. And because free trials draw people, this USP is one way to tell that their company prioritizes customer needs.
www.warbyparker.com


geicoGEICO – “15 Minutes Could Save You 15% or More on Car Insurance”

Straight to the point information about how GEICO works. It saves you money on auto insurance with just a few minutes of your time. This makes customers want to dig deeper to learn how this is possible. This is something you must remember when crafting a USP.
www.geico.com


15TOMS Shoes – “With every pair you purchase, TOMS will give a pair of new shoes to a child in need. One for One”

Charity is one way to sell. With every purchase comes a helping hand. This lets busy individuals, through their purchases, share what they have with needy children. TOMS Shoes uses this USP to attract the masses to an increasing sales report.
www.toms.com

With competition fierce, and with a number of companies trying to win the same audience, a compelling USP is not just  important, it’s critcal. You must draw customers with your short product statement. This requires an in-depth knowledge of all the aspects of your business and market.

Here are a few more samples of killer USPs:

M&amp;Ms – “Melts in your mouth, not in your hands”
Although this is a bit too fancy for a USP, M&amp;M’s certainly did sell from this. Who would have thought that chocolates wouldn’t melt when held? This company did. And this is how they set themselves apart from other chocolate manufacturers.

Colgate – “Improve mouth health in two weeks”
When a new product comes out, Colgate makes sure they sell it with improvements on their previous products’ performance.

BMW – “The ultimate driving machine”
This certainly has everything BMW can offer, powerful engines, sleek design, and the sophistication of its interiors. This one-liner aligns the company’s vision with what the customer wants. No wonder they’re selling!

Commercial-Investors.com – “Welcome to North America’s #1 place for safety conscious investors in search of high yields”
This not only states the company’s achievement but also speaks of investors’ concerns, offering service and a guarantee at the same time.16 17Man Crates, known to send guy gifts in crates, stands out not because of their products but their packaging.
mancrates.com

18What makes Ellusionist stand out? Well, because this site narrowly targets an exclusive audience – magicians. Products and tutorials sell, because magic is cool!
ellusionist.com

19Another way to sell is to have someone famous hold the product for you and state how he or she enjoys using it. Or in this site, Waitrose provides tutorials and recipes from the famous English baker and chef, Paul Hollywood. Showing how he uses the products convinces customers that their quality is far from ordinary.
www.waitrose.com

20Saffron Rouge touches on the desire people have for healthier skin and products made of all-organic ingredients. Moreover, they do not test their products on animals, so they effectively market themselves as the go-to skin care brand of animal lovers.
www.saffronrouge.com

modclothModCloth.com focuses on excellent customer service by providing multiple ways for buyers to connect with them, both before and after a sale.
www.modcloth.com

21Gaiam TV offers a trial service with unlimited access for 10 days, available to subscribers who sign up. The customers receive a sample of their services, and can opt to continue with their monthly subscription or not.
www.gaiamtv.com

22Watchco.com has an eye-opening 365-day returns policy. A returns policy this lenient shows customers how confident you are of your products. While this may not be possible for all ecommerce sites and the products that they offer, this is definitely something worth considering if you want a USP that impresses customers.
www.watchco.com

23PCspecialist.co.uk lets customers configure the heck out of the PCs they order. Regardless of your ecommerce niche, your customers surely appreciate you letting them customize their orders. Many USPs talk about uniqueness, being on time, and providing high quality work, but those that allow customization are very rare.
www.pcspecialist.co.uk

24Textbooks.com lets customers choose between used or brand new books. Using this as your USP can have quite a powerful impact on your ecommerce site, and can help you leverage both buyers and sellers.
www.textbooks.com

25Ellusionist.com is in a unique niche, which means there is very little competition.
www.ellusionist.com

26The way Despair, Inc. uses humor to differentiate their products from the rest of their competitors is ingenious.
www.despair.com

27Beauty.com allows discounts and scheduled auto reorders for their products. This lets your ecommerce site to leverage repeat business, helping you maximize the value of each of your customers.
www.beauty.com

28Warbyparker.com lets customers try on their products virtually, using the “Virtual Try-on” feature. If your ecommerce site sells men or women’s clothing, having a USP that talks about being able to try on the product virtually will surely give you an unfair advantage over your competitors who don’t.

ecommerce,13 Ways to Increase Your Online Shop’s Personality,"The Internet is a strongly democratizing place. With the combination of free shopping cart software, affordable web hosting, and marketing centrality afforded by Google and Facebook, anybody can set up a web shop. But because of the increasingly stiff competition, it’s no longer enough to have a responsive, easily navigable website with a perfect landing page and a seamless checkout procedure. To really stand out from the crowd, your online shop must have a special personality and create a certain intimacy with users.

In this post, we have collected 13 proven yet simple to implement tips that can elevate your store’s online presence and improve the conversion of visitors to customers. The tips are grouped together under two main subcategories: ways to humanize your site, and ways to provide visitors with valuable information so they will choose you over the competition.

**Be More Human**

Your customers are human beings, and are therefore social animals who like to interact with other humans. A web site with a human touch will be far more appealing and creates a more lasting connection with users, than a web site that’s designed as nothing more than a utilitarian online store.

The following tips will help you increase the humanity of your web store:

**1. Have a unique concept**

A unique site concept goes a long way towards increasing its distinctiveness and recall in the minds of customers. This uniqueness can come in many forms: unique colors, layout, presentation, and tone of writing, which can place it a cut above the competition.
This site has a unique layout and color scheme reminiscent of a wine bottle that matches its actual product. It also used the background image of the landing page to evoke a rustic image of wine created in Hungary.
www.hungarianwinesociety.co.uk

This web shop displays T-shirts in a unique way that imitates real life.
The dripping paint is also a clever referenceto the site’s name: Dripping in Fat.
www.drippinginfat.com

**2. Use Humor**

There’s nothing wrong with being serious: in fact, many corporate sites with online stores take themselves very seriously. But for the rest, humor can be a very powerful tool in the marketing arsenal, because it humanizes the subject and can convert even the most skeptical of audiences. However, humor should be carefully examined and tested first, because what is funny to some people may not be funny to everyone.

The humor here is aimed towards customers, and at the same time reinforces its manly branding (real men don’t read no instructions!)
www.mancrates.com

The humor used here is aimed inward: Greats.com’s caricatures of its founders humanizes them and makes them more accessible to customers.

Although now a part of Amazon, woot! maintains its idiosyncratic brand thanks to its snarky humor.
www.woot.com

Sofa.com uses a brand of snarky, tongue-in-cheek writing that is endearing to audiences.
It uses humor to drive home the tagline of “easy, fast &amp; free” in its mock Venn diagram.
www.sofa.com

**3. Display Social Responsibility**

Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept where a company shows a sense of responsibility towards the community and the environment which it operates in. Audiences today are more socially-conscious, and are willing to patronize products of ethical companies that embrace social responsibility, even if the products are more expensive (case in point: conflict-free diamonds and Fairtrade rules for farming). A company that displays its social responsibility up front and center becomes more human and appealing for like-minded visitors.

Toms.com has a unique value proposition: its founding concept of “One for One”links altruism to commerce. For every pair of new shoes it sells, the company will donate a pair of new shoes to children who need it.
www.toms.com

Sofa.com drives home one of its core values (“nice”) by proudly displaying the charitable contributions it made to special-interest organizations such as Afghan Connection (girls), Help for Heroes (injured soldiers), and Forest Carbon (environment).
www.sofa.com

**4. Add a human face to your shop**

Nothing humanizes a site more than attaching the face of an actual human being on it, because thistransfers the user’s impressions of the face to the site itself.But the face has to be real: either the owner’s face, or the faces of the site team. Do not use airbrushed models and stock photos that are used to market products, because it can backfire and raise questions on the site’s sincerity.

Pimsleur Approach adds a human touch to its offering by featuring its linguistic team. By displaying the languages its own staff are learning, the site makes itself more relatable to its customers, who are availing of the same language learning services.

www.pimsleurapproach.com

Sofa.com uses a mild self-deprecating tone, and makes an unspoken statement about its team and the quality of its working environment.
www.sofa.com

**5. Show gratitude to your helpers**

Gratitude is a powerful human emotion, which, according to psychological studies, strongly impact well-being (i.e. warm fuzzy feelings) – not only for the individual, but for all the people involved. Showing gratitude to those who helped build the site will distinguish it from the lack of emotion shown by most commercial shops. This can greatly increases the humanity and appeal of an online store.

Although Mummade used child models in its advertising, its expression of gratitude (and knowledge of the models’ names) elevates it above the rest of the competition. The act of gratitude will likely increase its appeal to the target audience: parents of young children
www.mummade.co.nz

**6. Celebrate the site’s birthday**

People are not the only ones who can have a birthday. Celebrating the site’s birthday adds a touch of personification by assigning human attributes to a website. At the same time, a celebration also provides an online store a good opportunity to garner publicity and stimulate sales.

This fashion retailer uses its birthday celebration as an excuse to offer a sale. Given the viral nature of the Internet today, the coupon code will likely be spread throughout the web, and increase the number visitors to the site. It can also improve the company’s brand recognition and name recall.
www.modnique.com

*Provide Information*

Customers today are very inquisitive, and look for enough information to make a good decision. Why not take control of the process, and present the information yourself on your own terms? Everything else being equal, an informative web shop will be seen as more reliable, trustworthy, and memorable than one that doesnot. Trust is a very precious commodity, especially since the competition is literally just a mouse click away.

The following tips will help you increase the usefulness of your site’s informational content:

**7. Focus on your “about us” page**

The “About Us” page is a convention adopted by sites all over the web. Although some designers may want to defy convention, there’s a reason why everyone is using it – it’s effective. The phrase is short – only seven letters, but there is no argument about what it means – it provides information about the company. Because of widespread exposure, visitors don’t need to be told where to click to find more information about your web shop. By all means, innovate on layout and design, but don’t forget your “about us page”.
There is one thing to remember: most “about the company” pages are dry, boring, and filled with corporate-speak. Focusing your attention on this often-neglected page can set you apart from the rest. According to the Marketing Sherpa, having a fancier “about us” page can increase conversions by 30%, so it’s well worth the time and effort to optimize this page!

Although quite wordy, this is definitely not a page written by lawyers. Black Milk Clothing uses its “About us” page to humanize its founder, and give the site added personality.
www.blackmilkclothing.com

Peter Nappi’s “about us” page conjures up an image of bygone times, when life was simpler and more fulfilling. Although the company is fairly new, it has the personality of being old and well-established.
www.peternappi.com

**8. Have a snappy vision and mission**

Sometimes there is confusion on what is the difference between a mission and a vision. Some companies have one without the other; others have both; and some combine them into a single statement. Simply put, a vision statement describes a dream or a goal (where is the company going?) while a mission statement describes the purpose (why do we exist?).
Strictly speaking, visionandmissionstatements aren’t a necessity (for example, Apple Inc. doesn’t have one!). Still, a well-written vision and mission will help a web shop align how its insiders views the site, with how its outsiders (the visitors) will view it.

Beardbrand reveals its raison d’être – providing quality grooming products for bearded men. By taking a stand and announcing a societal call-to-arms in its vision statement, it creates an emotional connection with the target customer, and greatly increases the chances of conversion.

Man Crates employs its quirky humor to craft a mission statement that clearly states its purpose for being:
to deliver awesome gifts for men.
www.mancrates.com

Sofa.com uses its mission statement to hammer home its “best value for money” image.
www.sofa.com

**9. Tell the company’s story**

Everyone loves stories. Stories appeal to our emotions, and story-telling has a long history as a tool for communication. If a life lesson is taught in a story compared to some other means (such as reading or through a lecture), it is remembered far more easily (look at Aesop’s fables or Jesus’ parables). A web shop can leverage the power of stories to stimulate the imagination of its visitors. By telling the company’s story, its lore and culture is spread far and wide. With stories, one can attract, create, and retain a faithful following.

Sofa.com’s brand of humor shines through in this tongue-in-cheek retelling about how the company bought its current domain name, which is of course an otherwise irrelevant tidbit.

**10. Add images to your story**

Show, not tell. In an age of broadband ubiquity around the world, it is now feasible to build lush websites populated in equal parts text and image that load in a reasonable amount of time. A story is powerful in its own right, but adding illustrative images can greatly magnify the effect. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words, right?

The distinctive beard and hairstyle of Eric Bandholz, one of Beardbrand’sfounders, resonates strongly with its vision statement, and lends a lot of power to the story below the image. In fact, this fact would be impossible to show with just text alone.

**11. Have a video**

If an image is worth a thousand words, think of the volumes of information you can convey with a single video. A video has several appealing advantages: with it, you can deliver a direct and clear message, but at the same time focus directly on a very particular topic. An embedded video also takes less screen real estate than the equivalent amount of text. With the advent of free movie hosting services like Youtube and Vimeo, it has become easier than ever to include a video on an online store.

**12. Increase credibility with press coverage**

You can say what you want about yourself on your own web site, but in the end, information that comes from third parties will always be viewed as having more reliability. To increase the credibility of your online store, it is important to cultivate relationships and provide links to news and review sites that covered your company or its products.

The site increased the credibility of its “blow dry bar” concept by tapping into press coverage from TV shows, print magazines, and online media sources.

Camila Prada, which markets designer ceramics, provides links to magazine articles that cover it. This increases the site’s legitimacy and appeal to design-conscious visitors who recognize the magazines’ distinctive pedigree.

**13. Let customers look behind the scenes**

Traditionally, a behind-the-scene is a documentary that shows the process behind making a TV show or a movie. These glimpses are typically bundled in DVD and Blu-ray releases, in order to addan extra value proposition to the home viewer who might have already seen the movie in the theaters. Allowing customers to look behind the scenes is a very powerful tool that catches their attention and hooks them emotionally. Since they are now privy to “secret” information, they have become insiders of sorts, and are more attached to the site.

Fudgehouse’s behind-the-scenes is a splendid visual experience, without any interrupting text. By showing the process behind the production of its iconic “luxury fudge”, the site fulfills an informational need, and, at the same time, stimulates its viewers’ cravings for the product.

ecommerce,16 Tips for Effective and User-friendly Faceted Navigation,"**16 Tips for Effective and User-friendly Faceted Navigation**

Faceted navigation helps ecommerce websites improve their customers’ product search experience. Often, customers are unsure of what they want, and would like to explore several products before deciding. Facets simplify the user experience by letting users investigate several choices quickly and efficiently.

For example, a customer who wants to buy a mobile phone faces so many options, such as brands, operating systems, price ranges, and features, that it can be hard to make a decision. But look at the facet for cell phones on Expansys.com, below. Using such filters, customers can quickly zero in on a just few models out of the thousands of mobile phones available on the website.

www.Expansys.com

Almost all major players employ faceted navigation on their sites. Effective faceted navigation systems ensure that customers don’t get lost in their search. Moreover, they can always “unselect” any of their previously selected options. Faceted navigation can significantly improve your conversion rate. In 2012, buyakilt.com an online dress retailer saw a growth of 76.1 percent in sales, 26 percent in conversions, and 19.76 percent in shopping cart visits after it added faceted navigation to its site. Facets can also improve search rankings. Of the many parameters that search engines use to rank websites, usability and user experience are among the most important. If the faceted search system is good, customers find it easier to access products of their choice, and therefore they spend more time on the site and purchase more.

This article offers 16 tips to maximize the benefits of faceted navigation.

**1. Use Relevant Options**

The facets, and the options within each facet, should be relevant to the product. For example, in the LED TV category, facet options should include price, brand, screen size, resolution, and so on. Within each facet, provide relevant filters to improve the search results, such as screen size ranges (15″ – 16″ or 17″ – 18,” etc.). In categories such as shoes and apparel, color and size options are essential.
Give customers many options. Price and brand are standard, but include all possible options specific to the category. To determine appropriate facet and filtering options, you can gain insight from viewing competitor sites, the websites of industry leaders, customer reviews, expert reviews, and commonly searched keywords.

www.about.com

**2. Position Facets Horizontally or Vertically**

Place facets either horizontally or vertically on top of products. Popular examples of horizontal placement include Yelp and Benetton.

www.yelp. Com

www.benetton.com

Horizontal navigation gives users a better view of options. However, horizontal navigation is only appropriate when there are a small number of products with minimal values. When dealing with numerous products, this option can make the site look cluttered. It may also compromise the user’s experience, since the filter menu disappears when the user scrolls down the page. Therefore, to use it, visitors must scroll back and forth. As can be seen from this example of Lifetimesterling.com, when users scroll down, the filters disappear.

Image 1: Horizontal facet

www.lifetimesterling.com

Image 2: Horizontal facet disappears upon scrolling down
When many products are for sale, a vertical arrangement works best, and is therefore most common.

www.officeSupply.com

**3. Present Facets for Maximum User-Friendliness**

There are several ways of displaying facets. Options include links, sliders, checkboxes, dropdowns, and input fields. Key determining factors are the type of data and the maximum user-friendliness for the data type.

Links are most common; industry leaders such as Amazon and eBay use this type. Users must click on the link to choose an option.

www.motorCycle-Superstore.com

www.gameStop.com

Sliders or input fields can be used for numerical values such as price or distance.

www.Nfm.com


Checkboxes let users include or exclude a particular option, or even choose multiple options, such as more than one brand. One thing to keep in mind when using checkboxes is that the entire area of a particular value or filter, including the text, should be clickable. This ensures that customers don’t have to struggle to click on a tiny box. As in the example below, customers should be able to click anywhere in the “Panasonic” or “Tripplite” box to select these options.

www.pronto.com

Dropdowns limit the choice to a single option, which can be a limitation. Cars.com uses dropdowns.

www.DocOrtho.com

There’s no one ideal method of displaying facets. Combine different options to arrive at the most effective method for your website. For example, Nordstrom has combined various options such as links, dropdowns, and checkboxes.

www.Nordstrom.com

**4. Use Facet Images**

Images play a major role in facet usability. They are ideal for selecting  colors, styles, and other options. Check out how Sunglass Hut makes effective use of facet images. Similarly, in the case of Airbnb, location is an important factor for the user, so it displays data in form of a map.

www.SunglassHut.com

www.Airbnb.com

**5. Include Customer Reviews as a Facet**

Large sites are using customer reviews as a facet more and more frequently. For example, Amazon.com and Kayak.com display customer feedback in form of one to five stars. As a best practice, only use this option if there are many ratings.

**6. Display Store- or Industry-specific Facets**

It may also be a good idea to create unique facet options based on customer needs, product characteristics, or industry requirements. For example, Amazon’s book section has options such as “100 books to read in a lifetime” or “Best books of 2013,” in addition to the standard choices such as subject, language, etc. This helps customers make a decision.  Also, you can name the facets according to the target customer profile. Take care to target all customer segments, especially those seeking specific solutions. See the Spanx.com example below.

www.Amazon.com

www.Spanx.com

**7. Use Collapsible or Expandable Menus**

Facets should allow users to collapse or expand the menus. This ensures customers can see the maximum filters. It also lets them choose the filters they want without having to click others. One important consideration is whether to display or hide the options by default. Hiding the filters by default might lower usage. However, if all values are displayed, other facets cannot be seen. One solution is to expose some values while hiding others. You can see examples of this from the UK Shopping and Target websites, shown below. This kind of default option gives visitors an idea of the content structure and also promotes the use of filters.

www.UK. Shopping.com

www.Target.com

**8. Clarity of choices**

The purpose of faceted navigation is to simplify things for your customers. Therefore, make sure that the options you provide are not confusing. Based on the customer profile, a single category can have different options. For example, see below how two leading retailers in the US— American Apparel and H&amp;M—have different ways of displaying options for shoes. There is no one “right way.”

**9. Organize Values Within the Facet**

It is very difficult to display all the values available within a facet. There are several different ways to do it.

•	*Inline Expand: In this method, the facet displays the first few values by default, and users can view additional values by clicking on “Show More.” An example is Home Depot.com. Another example is KL Wines, where customers can see the major options in each category. For other options, users must click on “View More.”

www.KLWines.com

•	*Scrolling: Scrolling is a widely used method. Zappos and Asos.com are good examples. NexTag.com combines show more and scrolling, where the scrolling is activated upon clicking the ‘more’ option. The scrolling method is even more effective if you providie a search option inside, as Yebhi.com has done.

www.Zappos.com

www.Asos.com

www.Yebhi.com

•	*Pop-up: In the pop-up method, the values display as a pop-up when the mouse hovers over the facet. eBay uses this method for displaying brands. Look.com also uses this method. This method saves space and minimizes clutter in the navigation. For example, DIY.com effectively combines a pop-up with “View All” to categorize its huge range of products into five broad categories and display detailed values in a pop-up format.

www.Look.com

www.Diy.com

•	*‘See all’ + pop-up + scrolling: In this method, upon clicking the “See All” button, a pop-up displays values the user can scroll through. This method is put to good use by Overstock.com.

www.Overstock.com

You can also choose any option that lets customers access maximum values with ease.

**10. Sort Values Within Facets Logically**

There are multiple ways to sort values within a facet. You can sort by unit count for facets such as brands, or by alphabetical order. Usually, facets such as size or price are arranged in ascending order. Take Amazon’s books page as an example. Within its “books” facet, values are sorted alphabetically, from Art &amp; Photography, to Bibliography, and so forth. Similarly, the “language” facet also displays values alphabetically. Its “book format” facet displays values by unit count. For example, “Paperback” has most units sold, so it appears on top. The facet for “Average customer review” shows values in a descending order, with 4 stars and above on top. The “new releases” facet is sorted in ascending order, with the most recent releases on top.

**11. Let Users Choose Multiple Filters**

Customers should have the option to choose more than one filter in a single facet. For example, a consumer who wants to buy a television may have shortlisted two or three leading brands and might want to know the sizes and price ranges available. These different combinations make your visitors’ decision-making easier.

www.Target.com

**12. Display Selected Values within facets**

To get the most out of faceted navigation, the features users have selected should be distinct from the rest. The display allows customers to check their location within the site and helps them change options easily. You can do this in three different ways:

•	*Inline: Under this approach, the selected value is displayed within the facet. For example, Amazon.com shows the selected option in bold with a checkbox next to it.

www.Amazon.com

•	*Breadbox: In this method, all selected features are displayed in a dedicated location, or “breadbox.” See an example below from OrientalTrading.com. A best practice is to display the facet along with the value, for example the value “Christmas” is part of the “holidays” facet.

www.OrientalTrading.com

•	*Breadcrumb trail: This list is shown about the search items. As the user continues choosing, the selection gets added to this trail. Usually there’s an ‘x’ icon accompanying the selection. Customers can remove the selection by clicking on the icon.

www.LandsEnd.com

•	*Integrated faceted breadcrumb: The display is similar to the breadcrumb. However, in this method, customers can change the option within the breadcrumb. Walmart uses this method.

**13. Refresh Pages Quickly**

When customers are changing options, the page refresh speed affects conversion a great deal. As customers continue choosing options, newer options should load immediately. According to a study, most users expect a site to load within two seconds. Importantly, if the site takes more than three seconds to reload, 40 percent of users abandon their search. According to another study, conversion rates peaked at two-second refresh rates, but every additional second of delay resulted in a 6.7 percent drop in conversions. The study recommended that customers prefer to see a “loading” notification or hourglass symbol to show that loading is in progress.

The use of AJAX technology can increase search results display rates. With AJAX, the entire page does not refresh every time the customer refines their option. It only sends selected data, which significantly reduces processing time. However, AJAX is not search engine-friendly, so you should restrict its use to enhancing the user experience.
 



**14. Avoid no results**

Avoid filter options with no results, as they tend to frustrate the customer. Only display available choices. It can be a disappointing experience for a customer to select an option (say a color or size) only to return no results. See below the example of JensonUSA.com, which displays the sizes available in black, while the rest are all nearly invisible.

www.JensonUsa.com

**15. Improve Constantly**

You should constantly collect data on how customers use facets and filters. For instance, which are the most widely used options? Which options do customers not use at all? This information can help you constantly improve the structure of faceted navigation.

**16. Example of a good facet**

Myntra.com is an excellent example. It uses a combination of horizontal and vertical filters. All the chosen options are easily visible, and users can cancel options with ease. It makes good use of scrolling, “many more,” submenus, sliders, checkboxes, images in the color palette, etc. Another highlight is that the horizontal facet bar remains fixed, even with infinite scrolling. It also uses an integrated faceted breadcrumb placed vertically, which lets users change options right on the search page.

ecommerce,23 Ways for E-Commerce Websites to Get Customer Feedback - Part 1,"As the saying goes, ” for every customer who bothers to complain, 26 other customers remain silent.” Usually, unless the experience is really bad, customers don’t bother to share the feedback. Instead, they decide never to do business with the service provider. Now, that’s a heavy price to pay for lost feedback.

The lost customer is not the only casualty. Studies have shown that each dissatisfied customer typically will share the unsatisfactory experience with 8-10 or sometimes, even 20 others. With growing usage of social media, a negative feedback going viral isn’t uncommon, thereby causing severe damage to the brand.

To address this challenge, companies are finding newer ways to engage customers and seek their responses. Let’s try to look at some commonly used ways of generating feedback.

Different factors come into play when choosing the most appropriate way of seeking feedback. Some of them include:

•	Objective behind seeking feedback

•	Frequency at which feedback is collected

•	Level of detail needed in the feedback

•	Touch point for approaching the customer

•	Customer relationship maturity

•	Resources required to seek and address the feedback


Based on these factors, the most appropriate method for seeking feedback can be selected.

**1. Dedicated Feedback E-mail or Feedback forms**

www.Minted.com

Option 1: The website can have a dedicated email, for example, feedback@xyz.com. If there are any complaints, customers can communicate their grievances through this email. This remains to be one of the most effective methods of generating feedback. According to a survey, 54% of online shoppers preferred this method for interacting with customer service.

Option 2: A contact form is placed on the website. The form can be developed by an in-house or a freelance web developer. In addition, quite a few third-party service providers such as Feedbackify offer creation of customized forms and embedding them on the website. As a best practice, the forms should include all the relevant questions related to feedback but should not have too many questions. Wherever possible customers should be provided with multiple options.
For greater impact, it is suggested that the email address or the form should be easily visible on the website. When using these methods, a ticket management system can be used for tracking. For both options, it is essential to set an autoresponder. The auto-responder should indicate the next action and a possible indication of time needed for resolution.

*Key Features:*

•	E-mail is the most popular method
•	General purpose
•	Easy to execute and administer
•	A must even if other feedback methods are used

**2. Complaint Ticket Closure Surveys**

www.Pokerstrategy.com

In this method, an email survey is sent out upon closure of a complaint ticket. The aim of this survey is to ascertain whether the resolution was in accordance with customer’s expectations.

Such surveys work well when there are only a few questions. 
Occasionally, customers are given the option to rate the experience on a scale of 1-5. Overtime, these ratings can provide certain valuable trends.

Another example will be questions with yes/no options. If there is a negative response, further details should be sought on what could have been done better.

Services such as SurveyMonkey can be used for generating these questionnaires.

*Key Features:*

•	*Specific purpose method to seek feedback on e-mail complaint resolution
•	*Average response rates with satisfied customers more likely to respond
•	*Helps in evaluating the performance of customer service personnel

**3. Live Chat Support**

www.Lids.com

According to a survey, 44% of online shoppers feel the best feature an e-commerce website can have is a live person responding to queries while shopping. Another survey says 90% of customers find live chat of great use, and 63% said they are more likely to go back to a website with a live chat feature.

Live chat can address a lot of issues, such as customers not being able to locate their chosen items or having questions on availability, payment, shipping, etc. The same survey provides another interesting data point — 38% of those who responded to the survey said the chat session was the primary reason for completing the purchase. Other studies have shown live chat can improve conversion rates by 20%.
Chat support can also help a company get closer to their customers by better understanding their needs and challenges. It also helps in identification of patterns if there are any recurring issues and helps in creating long-term solutions for such issues.

Various online services such as LivePerson, LiveHelp Now and WebsiteChat.net can be used for introducing live chats on the website. Similar to other feedbacks, the quality of response plays a key role in achieving optimum results. The responder should be able to address all questions of the customer promptly.

*Key Features:*

•	*Highly effective and widely used method
•	*Helps in increasing sales and improve customer understanding
•	*Requires dedicated and well-trained resources
•	*Provides cost savings on contact center and other similar expenses
•	*Improves credibility

**4. Feedback on Live Chat Session**

Similar to e-mail ticket closing surveys, a feedback can be sought once a live chat session is closed. This can include basic questions on the chat experience and whether it was of help. This also helps in finding out the effectiveness of the personnel on the chat. In case of an unsatisfactory response, prompt action can help in winning the customer’s trust.

*Key Features:*

•	*Specific purpose method to seek feedback on live chat
•	*Average response rates
•	*Prompt response to negative feedback can help in regaining the customers’ trust
•	*Helps in performance evaluation of chat-support staff

**5. Personalized E-mails**

Personalized emails can be an effective method of generating method. With customers receiving so many generalized/bulk mails, a personalized mail can go a long way in making them feel valued. Even if a mass mailing system is used, effort should be put in to make the e-mail look personal. For instance, according to a study, even if only if the salutation is personalized, it can result in a 5% increase in response rate. For example, the salutation can be ’Dear Mr. Tim’ instead of ’Dear Customer’.

The email should look as if it has been sent by a ’real’ person and not through a mass mailing system. This makes customers more obligated to respond to the mail. The e-mail should be short. While personalized, the email should still be professional and not annoy the customer. A key here is to respond to emails and closing any negative feedbacks only after the customer is satisfied; else it is highly unlikely that the customer will respond again. Personalized mails without mass mailing software can be used for high potential customers or customers with a troubled service history.

*Key Features:*

•	*Improves response rate
•	*Suitable for high-potential/dissatisfied customers
•	*Moderately effort-intensive
•	*Generates authentic feedback

**6. Phone Call**

A highly personalized way of seeking customer feedback is by calling the customers. The method is proactive and generates best responses.

The advantage of this method is getting firsthand feedback straight from the customer. Also, voice/tone provide an opportunity to sense customer satisfaction. A key here is the personnel making the call should come across as genuinely wanting to help or benefit the customer, and not as someone conducting a mere formality. If executed well, it helps in strengthening the relationship with the customer and makes the customer feel valued.

To get the most out of this method, it is important to contact customers at appropriate times. Studies have shown that customers are more likely to respond between 8-9 AM and 4-5 PM. Lunchtime between 1-2 PM is the absolute worst time to call.

This method is effort-intensive, and thus it is recommended to be used for high-potential customers or customers with a long-standing relationship.

*Key Features:*

•	*Suitable for high-potential/dissatisfied customers
•	*Highly personalized
•	*High response rate
•	*Resource-intensive

**7. Product Reviews**

www.Rugs-USA.com

Product reviews is one of the most widely methods of generating feedback for e-commerce websites. Customers are given an option to rate a product on a scale (say 1 to 5) with some blank space to share their feedback. It gives e-commerce companies real understanding about the quality of product as well as the overall experience of the consumer. While this method is voluntary, to get best results it should be backed by an email survey. This survey should be sent out to customers 3-4 days after the purchase of product.
A unique feature about this feedback is that it can be seen by other customers. Reviews play an important role as customers can get unbiased feedback on a product from actual users.
According to a survey, 42% administrators of e-commerce sites have witnessed average order values go up, when product reviews are included in the website. According to studies by Advances in Economics and Business (an international peer-reviewed journal) 85.57% of participants read reviews prior to shopping online. Of these, 83.65% make comparisons between negative and positive reviews. According to another survey, 79% customers treat product reviews equivalent to personal recommendations.

Product reviews provide an additional benefit by generating a significant unique content. This plays a key role in improving search engine rankings.

*Key Features:*

•	*Very popular and widely-used method
•	*High response rate and reliability
•	*Improves search engine rankings

**8. E-mail Surveys**

Source: www.signalvnoise.com/posts/3390-zingermans-simple-email-survey
A key highlight of this method is that information can be sought on the entire shopping experience, right from search to shipment, and it is a must for new shoppers. This survey should be sent out within 3-5 days of order confirmation. Regular customers should not get the feedback after every purchase as they may get annoyed. Tools such as SurveyMonkey can be used to sent out these surveys.

The survey should seek customer feedback on the following aspects:
1.	Motivation for choosing the store – price, availability, free shipping, higher on search engine ranking, etc.

2.	Method used to find the store – search engine, customer referral, social media site, comparison site, blog post, local listing, other online ads, etc.

3.	Feedback on product/service – quality, price, availability, others.

4.	Overall service experience – website navigation, ease-of-use, availability, customer service experience, delivery time, quality of communication, and other suggestions for improvement.

A key thing to keep in mind here is the feedback should appear as meant for customer satisfaction and not cross-selling. Negative comments, if any, should be resolved at the earliest to win customer loyalty and avoid any negative word-of-mouth. Positive feedback can also be shared on the website as that can make the customer feel more valued.

*Key Features:*

•	*Provides comprehensive and authentic feedback
•	*Timing and frequency is important
•	*Needs to be followed up with corrective steps
•	*Focus should be on feedback and not cross sales

**9. Social Listening**

www.JJBuckley.com

Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. can be an invaluable resource for customer feedback. A variety of tools are available that help in ’social listening’ or gathering conversations on social media about a brand. Some tools even help in monitoring the social presence of competitors. Just as other methods, it provides a great opportunity for brands to improve the customer experience and quickly respond to issues, if any.

Time plays a very important role in handling complaints on social media as negative comments spread really fast. This makes it really important the address the issue promptly and try to ease the customer’s angst. An ideal resolution to any negative feedback on social media is when the complaining customer is happy with the response and follows up the complaint with the positive customer service experience. At the same time, positive feedbacks can help get real insights into what’s working well and provide significant branding benefits.
This method requires dedicated resources for monitoring and responding to feedback. Companies use a combination of in-house and third-party staff along with a variety of tools such as HootSuite, Klout, Social Mention, etc.

*Key Features:*

•	*Usually authentic and reliable feedback
•	*Feedback spreads really fast
•	*Demands a fast response and closure time
•	*Requires dedicated resources
•	*Regular activity

**10. Order Confirmation Page**

Source:www.Econsultancy.com/blog/9134-best-practices-for-e-commerce-consumer-surveys

The order confirmation page can be used for seeking feedback on the online shopping experience. A few examples of questions will be whether the customers faced any difficulty in navigating the website and reaching the desired product/category, whether they were happy with the options available, etc.

Along with multiple choice questions, best practice is to have a general text box for other comments, which can be a useful source of information. This feedback can play a critical role in improving the usability of the website.

The questions should be multiple choice questions, and should be kept as minimum and brief.

*Key Features:*

•	*It provides feedback on usability of the ecommerce website
•	*Authentic feedback with good response rate
•	*The form should appear only after the order is complete

**11. Surveys and Polls**

www.Grainger.com

Polls can be an effective way of seeking feedback due to their userfriendliness. Polls can be conducted either on the website, through a newsletter, or through emails. Specific tools such as Polldaddy, SurveyMonkey, can also be used for this purpose. Polls can also be done through social media websites. For example, Target Australia makes excellent use of its Facebook page for conducting quick polls on various subjects. The pools can also have optional text boxes to get some additional qualitative feedback. The results should be displayed in a graphical and tabular format.

Polls can also play an important role in identifying trends, which can help in business decisions. For example, before a holiday season, a poll can indicate trends on what are the customers likely to buy and thus help in stocking.

*Key Features:*

•	*Special purpose, such as identification of trends, getting feedback on changes, etc.
•	*High response rate
•	*High engagement
•	*The poll should be kept short and simple

**12. Shopping Cart Abandonment**

Based on a study conducted by Baymard Institute, e-commerce sites face an abandonment rate of approximately 68%. Getting feedback from customers at this stage can play a key role in improving conversions. A pop-up with a small text box can be used to find out why customers did not proceed with the shopping. Customers can also be given a multiple-choice option to know the reason for abandonment.

Some options of responses can be, a) unexpected/added costs at checkout stage, b) got a better deal at another site, c) process taking long, d) delivery options don’t suit requirements, and so on. This pop up should also provide the customer an option (either an email link or a phone number) to contact customer service.

*Key Features:*

•	*Specific feedback related to abandonment reason
•	*Useful for improving conversions
•	*Good response rate
•	*Customer support details should be included

ecommerce,Starting ecommerce store for a company. Need some advice.,"Hello r/ecommerce.

I've been asked by my company to take care of the internet business.
We have these guys who have been managing our website for years, so we asked them to estimate a whole new ecommerce store.

They have suggested me [open2b](http://www.open2b.com/software/e-commerce/piattaforma-prezzi.html) which I guess it's good for them because it's local. Anyway I can't find much about it. It's not even listed in common platforms list.


Do you have any advice or tips on how to move? Should I let them do all the work? I can't find much on this subreddit about costs and expenses, I guess most of user do all the work themselves, however my coding skill is not good enought.

The initial charge for the project (platform and hosting excluded) would be about 4000€ including the consulting part, a personal custom template and the start up.",2.0,3,2014-08-23,ECOM,0.02333247847855091,0.9236305952072144,0.05303696170449257

ecommerce,23 Ways for E-Commerce Websites to Get Customer Feedback - Part 2,"**13. Monitoring On-site Activity**

A range of tools are available in the marketing for monitoring customers’ on-site activity. Some examples are Google Analytics, Crazyegg, KISSmetrics, etc. These tools provide a thorough feedback on the users activity on the site, and provide intelligent feedback. Some examples include time spent on each page, click pattern, pages with high exit rates, source of traffic, exit pages history.
For example, if a high percentage of customers go to the FAQs page from a particular page, it can indicate that the content on this page is not helpful. Or if customers spend less time on some pages, it will indicate that the information on this page is not matching their needs.
Regular monitoring of these aspects is essential to improve conversions. It works best when a dedicated resource is assigned the responsibility of tracking this activity and making or suggesting changes.

*Key Features:*

*Essential method of getting feedback on user behavior
*Monitoring should be done regularly
*Tools available in the market

**14. Usability Testing**

This type of feedback can be collected through a third-party agency, which specializes in user testing. Examples of service providers include usertesting.com, Concept Feedback, FiveSecondTest, etc. The method is ideal for testing out new landing pages, new features, new designs, etc. Another important application is finding out the causes of any problems identified during monitoring of on-site activity, such as why do some pages have high bounce rates.

With usertesting.com, companies seeking feedback need to outline the tasks or pages they want to be tested. Once the tasks are outlined, it is possible to watch users performing those tasks. Testing can be done in various ways, such as testing on participants of the agency’s panel, testing on own customers or testing live visitors on the website. This method is highly effective in improving user experience. In a short time, feedback either in form of videos of users’ site experience, or as written answers to personalized questions can be received. The tool also allows interaction with customers once the test is complete.
A new standard in feedback has been set by sites such as Usabilla.com. These provide visual and easy-to-understand feedback. In December 2013, Usabilla hosted more than 2 billion feedback buttons in a month.

*Key Features:*

*The method is particularly useful for evaluation of new features/additions or identification of problems
*Live testing/feedback from own customers is possible
*Objectives should be clearly defined
*The feedback is collected through third-party applications

**15. Mobile-based Solutions**

Mobile is not too far behind when it comes to feedback solutions. A range of tools are available that help in monitoring support tickets as well as reviews and comments fields. They also allow responding to customer complaints from mobile, and even include pre-defined responses. Examples of such tools include Zendesk, FAQ, OTRS, Satisfaction Remote, UserVoice, Kayako.

Additionally, ClickDesk send all chats and calls to GTalk or Skype making it easier to respond to customer queries in real-time. With FreshDesk, all customer emails, mentions on Twitter and Facebook comments get converted into support tickets. SmarterTrack, along with managing and tracking customer communications, also tracks sales opportunities.

*Key Features:*

*Improve response time
*Help in fast resolution of queries
*Multiple tools available

www.Zendesk.com


www.Freshdesk.com

**16. Online Community**

Creating a forum or community either on the website and/or a social network can generate some excellent feedback. The method can be implemented with ease, but requires continuous monitoring and a full-time moderator. The moderator’s responsibilities include starting new discussions, moderating of discussions, regular postings/updates, responding to feedbacks, and so on. Through this forum, users can be encouraged and incentivized to share their experiences or even pictures and videos. For example, the homepage of Bebe.com has pictures of customers wearing the merchandise purchased from their site.

This method increases user engagement and helps in strengthening relationship with the customer. It can also provide some excellent feedback and new ideas. A key theme of this method is engagement, therefore customers should get a timely response for their queries. Also it’s important that discussions are moderated for appropriateness. Spammers, if any, should be banned. For best results, the moderator needs to regularly monitor the page in terms of number of members, likes, new discussions, posts with maximum responses or feedback, etc. Based on this, new content/discussions should be introduced.
Tools such as Get Satisfaction and UserVoice that help in building communities and facilitating discussion between customers and businesses.

*Key Features:*

*High user engagement
*Continuous activity and requires full-time attention
*Can be an excellent source for feedbacks and ideas
*Pictures, videos and contests can be displayed


**17. Feedback on Other Sites**

An excellent source of feedback is on other websites such as online communities, blogs, local listings, and so on. If the customers are not happy with the resolution to a negative experience, they are likely to vent their ire on these forums.

Examples of tools include Trackur that tracks conversations about a brand on all platforms. Yext allows managing local listings and allows monitoring of reviews and ratings. Another good tool is Reputation.com that not only helps in monitoring reviews about a brand, but also provides information on feedback about competitors. Other tools include Google Alerts, Tweetbeep, LocalVox, etc.

*Key Features:*

*Highly authenticity of feedback
*Tools available for monitoring the feedback
*Response should be prompt
 
**18. Displaying Customer Feedback**

Displaying customer feedback on the website has numerous advantages. One it serves as a motivation and recognition for the customers who have shared feedback and makes them feel more valued. This encourages them to give feedback more often. Another key advantage is that other customers get encouraged to see that their feedback will not go unattended.

Also, studies show usually people are encouraged by others behavior and once they see others acting in a certain way, they feel confident and also behave identically. This is equally true for feedbacks. If customers see more and more people sharing feedback, they are also more likely to share their experience. The reviews should appear genuine with full name of the customer and organization or location, if available. Some companies resort to ’fake’ reviews, but customers are too intelligent to differentiate between real and fake reviews.

*Key Features:*

*Very effective way of increasing the number of feedbacks
*Helps in gaining customer trust
*Should appear as credible by ’real’ customers and not ’made up’

www.NationalBuliderSupply.com

**19. Resolving Negative Feedback and Publishing the Solution**

One of the key reasons for low feedback response rates globally is that customers doubt if their feedback will be taken seriously. Usually it looks like a formality with no focus on really solving the customers’ problem. Many companies fail to see the opportunity in negative feedback. It can serve as a key tool to showcase the customer service capabilities of a company.

As a first step, the negative feedback should be responded at the earliest. The acknowledgement should include a response time for resolution. Once the complaint is resolved, the entire feedback and the resolution can be published. This helps not only in gaining the trust of the irate customer; it also sends out a positive signal to other customers that their feedback will be taken seriously. An ideal resolution is if the complaining customer adds another positive review stating satisfaction over the resolution.

*Key Features:*

Great opportunity to demonstrate customer service capabilities
Improves response rate if customers can see genuine intent to help
Helps gain repeat business and positive word-of-mouth from complaining customers

**20. External Feedback Agencies**

Third-party agencies can be also be a great resource in measuring the entire customer experience. Examples include Foresee, which is one of the largest players in the customer analytics space. Another key example is ZenDesk.

Support is provided across all channels such as web, mobile, contact center, stores, and social media. A key advantage of using such services is they have the advantages of scale. A single company may not have access to the up-to-date technology and dedicated staff like these providers. A disadvantage is that the personalization element is lost and it may appear as non-genuine to customers.

*Key Features:*

*Feedback across all channels
*Widely used by many companies
*Can be expensive in comparison to in-house methods
*Advantages of scale in terms of technology and staff


**21. Humanizing the Store**

With so many sites to choose from, more often than not a lot of e-commerce sites end up looking the same. To solve for this, websites need to be humanized so that each website has a personal touch. This not only helps in improving conversions, but also increases feedback as the customers feel they are talking to a real person and not a website.
One way to do this is to increase the personality element on the website. Companies can choose either a real person or a fictional character to symbolize the brand. For example, BobbiBrown.com has the full story of Bobbi, with her preferences, her vision, etc. This way a nearness is developed with the customer and the customer will be more forthright in giving a feedback.

To create an effective character, it is important to know more about the target buyer’s personality such as age, gender, profession and so on. This will help in creating the appropriate tone and voice for the website. Best pratice is to have a blog as well as videos and images related to the character to improve customer engagement.

*Key Features:*

*Useful in improving engagement as well as feedback
*Target customer understanding is important
*Regular communication through blogs, videos and images is essential

**22. Ask feedback in return for a prize or gift**

Typically, it is very difficult to generate positive feedback. The customer is more likely to send feedback over an unpleasant experience. This problem can be solved by giving out gifts to customers for sending feedback. The gifts can include free shipping, discounts on future purchases, free samples, gift cards, lucky prize draws, etc. The prize should be valuable for the customer and not seen as a cross-sell tactic.

One of the few risks with this method is the customers may see this as a ’bribe’ to get positive feedback. This risk can be negated by keeping the tone of the e-mail or survey as a genuine effort to improve customer service.

www.vintageInn.co.uk

*Key Features:*
*Improves response rate
*It should appear as a genuine incentive
*Incentive should be valuable for the customer
*Frequency of surveys should be moderated for regular customers

**23. Managing Relationship with Regular Contributors**

Finally, feedback sharing should be not a one-time activity. It is very important to keep the regular contributors motivated and make them feel valued. This can be done in different ways. A key method is to act upon their feedback so that they are forthcoming to provide feedback the next time. They will feel valued and know that their feedback is taken seriously.

Another way could be giving them special discounts and incentives, for example prior notification about an upcoming discount scheme. Publishing their testimonials with names and photograph on the website along with a reward can give recognition and a feeling of pride. These customers can also be invited to test any new features and incentivized for the same.

*Key Features:*
*Helps in relationship-building and branding
*Customers feel valued and preferred toothers
*Feedback can be sought on new features before launch

ecommerce,35 Responsive Ecommerce Site Examples,"A Responsive Website can be easily identified since it has a few key features which make it stand out, such as:

A. If the website is Fast, Vibrant, Neat and easy to Navigate
B. If the website adjusts its size to your device (specifically at that) be it an iPhone, Blackberry or iPad
C. If the website requires minimal scrolling and minimizing/maximizing and does not require you to change a lot of pages to navigate.

If you’ve come across a website with the abovementioned features, rest assured, it is a Responsive Website.

Below are some examples of the best Responsive E-Commerce Websites we’ve come across on the internet but before that, a little on why we have emphasized E-Commerce.

E-Commerce has taken the internet world by storm. Most of the retail’s brick and mortar stores now have an online presence and people are responding well to this convenience. We’ve emphasized these particular websites because they tend to require the most amount of activity by the visitor and hence the sites need to be highly responsive.

**Most Responsive Websites**

**1. www.KingArthurflour.com**

This website has 1,150,000 visitors per month on an average (the data is only an estimate). It sports a Neat, Clean and Vibrant Design with Easy Navigation (Even on mobile). The navigation column lists all the sub-pages of the main page in a horizontal form so you don’t have to scroll down as usual.

**2. www.Hickoryfarms.com**

Allowing its visitors to shop in the manner they desire sets this website apart. It allows you to shop by category or by price which is a great responsive feature. The website is beautifully designed in CSS. The Cart experience is smooth and navigation around the website is nothing to complain about.


**3. www.Explore.ee.co.uk**

EE is a 2/3/4G network service provider. Normal things aside (browsing, cart, etc., which are quite responsive) this website features a distributor locator and a coverage checker in the top header which is quite unique and makes it an ideal network provider website.

**4. www.KarmaLoop.com**

What is impressive about this website is the unique feature of Cart and Checkout running on every page starting from the front page. Instead of having to go to the cart to checkout, you can press an instant button and do the deed. Fast, smooth and easy navigation apart from good mobile responsiveness makes it very responsive in our opinion.

**5. www.Tsubo.com**

Tsubo deals in online range of footwear for both men and women. Sporting a clean and minimalistic design, the site provides a chat feature more as an embedded option on every page rather than on a specific page. You can use the chat feature even while viewing the website on mobile.

**6. www.Garmin.com**

Featuring a sharp chic design, this website which sells consumer, marine and aviation technology devices, as well as maps, is quite responsive. Navigation is fast and easy. The front page is quite catchy and the “Maps” feature which allows you to explore maps is quite responsive. Mobile viewing does not compromise on responsiveness quality at all.

**7. www.Fredericks.com**

With scintillating CSS and Javascript usage to create a neat-looking website with colors which are easy on the eyes, this website is highly responsive. A store locator, login in/out button and cart are available as buttons in the header. The  home  page comprises sale offers from almost all sections and are advertised in the top navigation column.
We were particularly impressed with the store locator which can track down any store within a specified distance of the zip code you enter. The shopping and mobile experience were quite smooth.


**8. www.CpoOutlets.com**

What was particularly impressive was the responsive navigation column which sported a barrage of options yet was clean and sharp, with illustrative pictures next to the options. Fast and smooth navigation through the rest of the website was impressive too.


**9. www.Magazines.com**

This website is a perfect example of a well-organized magazine website (which is inherently complex by structure). The top navigation column sports all categories as well as highlighting all the important categories. On the front page it shows all magazines which can be directly added to the cart. The user’s subscriptions can also be viewed on the front page.

**10. www.TheGrommet.com**

This was one of the more responsive websites we came across. The website puts on offer almost any kind of product one can think of, allowing people to post products as well. The page where products are posted shows very sharp pictures of products and their sellers. Navigation is fast without requiring much scrolling or resizing whether on desktop or on mobile. Another cool responsive feature was the pop out instructions or details which appeared whenever you hovered over certain buttons.

**11. www.Godiva.com**

This website sells assorted chocolates online. With a unique boutique locator in its header along with the cart option and beautiful pictures of chocolates in high definition, it nevertheless allows easy, smooth and fast scrolling. This website is highly responsive.

**12. www.DiscountFilters.com**

This website markets various types of Air and Water filters. Right on the front page banner is a quick search tool which allows you to search for the filter of your choice, giving the website extra responsiveness points. Navigation was quick and smooth and the cart experience was good as well.


**13. www.Pfaelzer-brothers.com**

What stands out about this website is the beautifully illustrated product pictures and the responsive feature which allows the visitor to shop by cuts (since the website deals in selling meat). The navigation is flawless. The Cart experience is quick and secure.


**14. www.AmericanMusicalSupply.com**

Featuring one of the most responsive mobile designs, AMS’s website deals in selling music products online. It previews a barrage of its products over a wide range, and it does so quite well with a side-bar for easy navigation. On mobile view, these tabs are clubbed into buttons for a buttery smooth view. Very responsive.

**15. www.Joann.com**

This website sells fabrics online. Beautifully designed in CSS, it is easy and extremely fast to navigate. The front page comprises various graphic pictures of the products which can be taken straight to the cart. Overall, a very responsive website.

**16. www.Threadless.com**

Being an online apparel store, Threadless sports is an extremely intelligent web design. Similar to the facebook notification button, it has a button in the header which shows updates relating to the website and money events. Good in mobile view and shopping experience, this is a very minimalistic yet responsive design.

**17. www.Prankplace.com**

What we found to be responsive about the website was that each category of its products has been shown in multiple ways, none of which seems unnecessary. The top navigation column shows all categories while the bottom portion shows them with illustrations again. Overall, it makes the viewing experience quite easy and smooth for the visitor.

**18. www.Cloggs.com**

Selling women’s clothing and apparels, this website features a neat design on the desktop version. However, the mobile version takes the cake, with a magnifier and cart well-incorporated in a small space in the header. The cart experience was smooth and fast as well.


**19. www.Kershaw.kaiusaltd.com**

Selling knives online, this website sports a unique design in which the front page banner does not scroll up but instead the lower portion of the website takes its space, which is quite cool to look at. The browsing is extremely fast and the illustrations of products extremely crisp and neat. Mobile viewing is great too.

**20. www.Firebox.com**

Selling a wide range of “cool” things to buy, Firebox sports two navigation bars to aptly display all the categories. The website design is somehow haphazardly stacked yet it works in its favor in terms of responsiveness. It allows the option to change your currency for your country which is expected in other websites too.

**21. www.Mulberry.com**

Extremely swift yet high definition design is the asset of this website. Sporting a minimalistic and highly responsive scheme, Mulberry takes the cake in terms of browsing quality. The mobile viewing experience is also great as expected. Using the cart was fast and easy.

**Medium Responsiveness**

**22. www.Carters.com**

Selling baby apparel, Carters.com also allows you to visit Oshkosh.com via the header as well, but this loads very slowly (and thus it loses out points on responsiveness). The website otherwise is quite smooth and easy to navigate and the mobile viewing is decent as well.

**23. www.Nixon.com**

From the looks of it, it seems like a highly responsive website. The front page offers a chicklet design with the option to enter the male or the female section at first instance. However, it loses out by missing a top navigation column for all its options (watches, headphones, accessories etc.).


**24. www.Indochino.com**

Offering men’s apparel, this website does a fine job as a minimal yet responsive website. Some of the front page banners were slow to load even on a high speed connection. Yet, navigation in general is fast enough and cart experience is smooth and easy.

**25. www.InvitationBox.com**

Dealing in all sorts of invitations including both printed and handmade versions, this website features a unique design. It lists all the categories and many featured products on the front page itself, some of which keep scrolling automatically. Despite a complicated structure and a large number of elements on the pages, it is quite responsive.


**26. www.Paintballonline.com**

While the mobile version of the website is quite responsive, the desktop version fails to stand out as a very responsive website. With a slightly complex structure, the top navigation bar looks a little too cramped. The shopping experience was smooth and overall the website is decently responsive.


**27. www.MilesKimball.com**

With a slightly overcrowded design on the desktop version, this website still stands out to be quite responsive. The top navigation column rolls down sub-categories under categories in a slow, smooth drop-down fashion which might come across as slightly annoying. However, the same categories as above have also been identified at the bottom of the page, including all other important links, thus making it easy to surf the website. The mobile experience was fairly average.


**28. www.TylerTools.com**

Dealing in mostly hardware tools, this website has a clean interface designed in CSS and Java with good illustrative pictures of products. A slightly useless “Bookmarks” add-on is supplied in the header which could have been better utilized. The mobile and shopping experience are okay yet nothing to take home.


**29. www.UniqueSquared.com**

Selling music products online, this website has been very intelligently designed for desktops. Smooth navigation, clean interface and high definition yet quick-loading pictures are a few of the highs. However, the mobile version of the website stands in stark contrast with non-contracting pictures thus showing that it isn’t built for mobile responsiveness.


**30. www.Bonobos.com**

The great thing about this website is that it’s highly minimalistic on the front page yet leaves out no details in the subpages. Extremely easy to navigate and with a store locator and appointment fixing option on the front page makes it a responsive website.


**31. www.WetSeal.com**

The browsing experience on WetSeal could be classified as responsive. Although the intentionally catchy color scheme isn’t the most pleasurable on the eye, the responsive drop-down menus and placement of cart, delivery checker and sale offers appearing on the front page does make it easy enough to navigate. The shopping experience however wasn’t very smooth as the “Add To Bag” button would stop functioning while the whole page was loading.

**32. www.Everythingfurniture.com**

This website sports a somewhat minimalistic yet responsive design featuring various types of furniture for sale. The structure is good therefore giving it responsiveness-points. Browsing and shopping were nothing to complain about. Overall for what the website wishes to display, it is a decently responsive website.

**Average to Low Responsiveness**

**33. www.EckoUnltd.com**

Although the website design is not all that great, in terms of responsiveness it just about does its job. A social media button has been integrated into the front banner of the website which gives it a crowded look and hampers easy navigation. Cart and Mobile experience were nothing to complain about, however, we expect mobile users might have a little trouble using this website.

Selling women’s clothing, this website which has a rather complicated structure, makes navigation even on a high speed connection slightly glitchy. The front page rotating banner moves a little slow. However, the rest of the website is smooth enough. The bright and illustrative pictures of its products that are spread all over works in its favor.

**35. www.Skymall.com**

This being a large online shopping website, it quite expectedly has a complicated structure, however all the options are available right on the front page. It loses out on the color scheme which isn’t very pleasant and also on the scrolling navigation menus which have a lag time of about 1-2 seconds. The mobile experience however was pretty decent.

**Conclusion**

The above catalogue of assorted responsive web designs is a guide to tell you that when it comes to responsiveness, especially for ecommerce websites, fast and glitch-free browsing, easy mobile viewing and most importantly, features which increase the usability of the website are much more important than just a great looking design. Even if your website looks great on desktop but fails to function properly on mobile devices, you’ll be losing out on a chunk of your potential market considering how a large section of the desktop surfers have started using their mobile devices substantially more since the introduction of 3G/4G internet.

Some websites feature fantastic applications for ease of access and improved usability such as Store Locator using Map Devices, Illustrative 360 Degree Viewing options for products, Easy Checkout Buttons etc. which add great amount of responsiveness to the website design.

Additionally, minimalistic designs seem to be more responsive owing to their ease of access (and less cramped up components thrown into one page), however, if you have a website on which you must display a lot of components, spacing them out evenly or using suitable color schemes along with quick loading of elements helps a long way when it comes to making it responsive for the visitors.
Another feature in responsive web designs is the Visitor-Friendliness-Quotient. For instance, certain websites clearly display the option to log in or subscribe or bookmark the page, which depending on the type of a website can really help you retain organic traffic through responsiveness.

Of course, making the shopping process easy, fast and secure on mobile devices is a challenge but most of the abovementioned websites seemed to get past this task with ease and that shows why mobile functionality is one of the essential features in any responsive ecommerce website.",0.0,1,2014-08-23,ECOM,0.043693563900887966,0.9228014796972275,0.033504987601190805

I'm hoping the experts here can point me to at least one solution that I can look into.

The scalar attributes seem to be easy. Every E-commerce site I find can handle those. It's the ability to define the minimum and maximum dimensions that I'm have issue with.

ecommerce,BigCommerce / Shopify / Suggestions?,"I'm currently in the process of looking for a new ecommerce platform for my company and was hoping to get some feedback from you guys on what which platform would work best for us. We're currently using 3dCart and are looking for something that is easier to use.


We have about 350 SKU's right now and are looking to expand the amount we offer in the future. 


Our website right now looks quite unprofessional and I'm honestly surprised we do as much business as we do on it but we're a very niche store which helps things. I want to completely redesign the store from scratch to make a professional and clean looking page that will help out with our horrible bounce rate.


I need something that is easy to work with or at least fairly easy to learn that gives me lots of design options as I like to be creative.


We currently have some of our product listings being fed into Amazon through 3dCart as well so if that's possible on either of these platforms that'd be great.


Some of our products are quite expensive (3k+) and due to this we were thinking about implementing PayPal Credit (Bill Me Later) and we've also partnered with a financing company for our normal business that we'd like to be able to use on our new site as well. They have a widget that I'd like to be able to include on the site if possible. 


Mobile is a huge goal for us so being able to optimize the store on mobile separately from the main store is really big for us.


SEO optimization is something we're definitely striding for as well. We need good reports to analyze sales and what we can do better. 


How is the shipping aspect on both of these platforms as well? 3dCart is pretty good and allows for UPS label printing and packing list printing straight from our portal on 3dCart which makes it easy on our warehouse person. UPS integration is a big thing for us.


All of our payments currently run and are processed through our PayPal account (even if they don't directly pay through PayPal) which helps lower the overall costs of our transaction fees for our business as a whole. 


How is the inventory management between the two? We're currently using FishBowl for our whole company and I know there is a way to integrate FishBowl with Shopify (it costs about 3k) but I was seeing how integration would be with BigCommerce as well.


I think I'm forgetting a major point...but I appreciate any insight you guys could provide!",14.0,4,2014-08-26,ECOM,0.023106088861823082,0.9307674765586853,0.04612640663981438

woocommerce,maximum quantity rules not being implemented correctly?,"Hi all,

I have the maximum quantity per order set to 6, but when trying to check out with a number of items that is clearly less than six (two is fine, three or more gets blocked) - the ""The maximum allowed order quantity is 6 - please remove some items from your cart."" error comes up. 

Any suggestions or ideas regarding what might cause this or how to fix it?

I can add a picture of the issue if needed. Thanks!",0.0,0,2014-08-30,ECOM,0.6490445137023926,0.3330700099468231,0.01788552850484848
