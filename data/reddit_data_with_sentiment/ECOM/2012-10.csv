dropship,Handling a returns policy and a customer service line question.,"I read about drop shipping about 6 months ago and was intrigued about it.  I was searching for a niche and I found one.

I live in Korea and a friend of mine (Korean) works with a manufacturer on a great niche.  I mentioned drop shipping to my friend and he said his boss wants an American presence.  The only problem is that I am in Korea for another 6 months to a year.

He wants me to have my customer service in America.  Any ideas on how to outsource my customer service to a knowledgeable person? I was thinking of call forwarding but I would be asleep when I would get calls.

He was also concerned about the returns policy.  I want something that is fair for both of us if that is possible.  Do any of you have examples of a good agreement with returns that you have worked out with your manufacturer?

ecommerce,Upgrading ecommerce platforms from NRS - Radiant - CPonline to Magento,"We are looking to upgrade from our current ecommerce platform NCR (formally Radiant Cponline) and move to a more more feature rich solution. We are retail brick and mortar and have 6 POS stations, &amp; two work stations. Our current integration with our ecommerce is thru a SQL server and Counterpoint POS.

Radiant just changed over to a Magento platform and wants to charge 3% of total sales &amp; hosting fees which I was told would run us around $350-$400 a month.  I guess that`s what happens when you are bought out by Ebay tho right?

I suggested to employer that we break free from NCR and go solo on Magento as its open source in the first place. My employer states that if Magento can integrate with a SQL server than he has a friend that should have no problem making a script/tool that will integrate our Counterpoint POS systems with a Magento platform. 

My job as web admin would be the helping with the initial setup and maintenance of the website. Graphics, Items, SEO, Layout, Scripts etc would be on me. I`m competent at HTML and CSS but dont have much experience in PHP. What should I expect when moving to Magento? 

Should be be looking and considering other ecommerce platforms? My employer mention ASP.net as well. Ease of use is of concern but the greater concern would be flexibility and the ability to expand hence why I tend to lean towards Magento and a open source project. 

What hosting should we look at? I`m hosting us a basic Magento site right now on Hostgator. Setup was once click simple and I have been playing around with the settings. Is a business plan with Hostgator worth considering for hosting?

Any thoughts, suggestions or recommendations would be awesome!",5,1,2012-10-09,ECOM,0.0326213538646698,0.9232999086380005,0.04407878592610359

ecommerce,Hey all new established companies. Here's a new way to be seen.,"Hi everyone! 

I would like to introduce Qalixa, an international marketplace for all trading needs. As a free tool, this platform provides everything you need as a newly established company, or a well-branded enterprise.

By combining B2B, B2C and C2C into B4A (business-for-all) we help you find your way to your best trading experience. Upload your products, create and manage your own web shop or find new distrubutors for your company's needs - it's all free of charge.

Since Qalixa was founded in Sweden, it's pretty natural that we turned to Swedish brands and companies in first hand. Today we recieve product feeds from over 70 well known brands all over Sweden, a total of over 3.000.000 products.

This way we offer companies a free chance to be seen, heard and explored. On the other hand, we provide a better price guide for consumers looking for the perfect deal.

One question we get a lot is; how do you make money?

Well, as I mentioned before, nearly every service we offer is free of charge. But we also have one service that is to be implemented in a near future. We offer statistics of userdata to companies, as well as a possibility to create and manage their own networks.

So companies can observe the ongoing trends and user behaviour right from Qalixa, where they have all their products and services listed. It's all in one place!

Feel free to contact me for further information or visit our website and social medias for news and updates!

ecommerce,Questions about product fulfillment,"So I've been investigating an eCommerce niche.  It is a very complicated niche that requires a lot of technical information to do well.  It is also growing in popularity, so there are a lot of new people that want to get into the hobby, but don't have the knowledge to do so yet.

I want to start an eCommerce store that helps bundle together all the various components they need, along with detailed instructions to assemble/operate everything.

To do that, I would need to source products both domestically and from China.  Some of the items are *only* made and sold in China, while some parts are *only* made and sold here in the States (by small companies or even individuals).

I'm pretty sure this rules out dropshipping, since I need to bundle everything together.  And some of the products probably can't be dropshipped since they are handmade by individuals/small businseses.

I've investigated Fulfillment by Amazon, but it seems like a huge barrel of worms.  And expensive, since I have to also pay inbound shipping to FBA.  

Is my only option left to use my house as a warehouse in the beginning?  Am I missing something or not thinking something through all the way?",2,1,2012-10-30,ECOM,0.040024448186159134,0.927516758441925,0.03245886042714119
