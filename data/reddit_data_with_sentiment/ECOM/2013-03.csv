ecommerce,Marketers failing at Content Marketing,"Content marketing is a marketing format for the creation and sharing of content. It helps in promoting the business online and finally acquiring customers. Now-a-days, online retailers are using the content marketing to attract customers. However, generating the quality content requires time &amp; resources.

Until recently, marketers who were performing SEO had focused on link building to get high-ranking on Google SERPs. Since Google has changed its algorithm that is used for ranking the websites, marketers are now interested in content marketing.  Online marketers may get benefited from content marketing for their online retail shopping carts if they avoid the following common mistakes:

•	Not scheduling the content activities: Content should have to be planned &amp; created ahead of time. Marketers should devise plans and the marketing activities for the year &amp; all the events should comply with this schedule. One of the easiest ways to design the content calendar is to consider all the upcoming holidays or festivals. Marketers along with online retailers can decide about the content theme and promotional offers for each festival.

•	Not using the buyers’ perception: Marketers &amp; online retailers need to understand that, to have an effective marketing campaign, right message should have to be delivered, to the right audience and at the right time. If the marketers don’t know about their customers, they cannot create the customized messages for them. This also helps in answering the queries of the customers/ visitors. Marketers can customize their content for promotion based on the questions their customers are asking.

To create the content according to the buyers’ perception, marketers need to keep in mind about the age &amp; the gender of their customers and their income levels.

•	Not prioritizing the content: There are many options available to marketers for publishing the content. They can send e-mails to their prospective customers or can share information on social media or write in the forums/blogs etc. Marketers/ online retailers should prioritize which medium they are going to utilize. This is important as every medium used for publishing the content generates different types of results.

•	The quality of the content: Online retailers or marketers should create &amp; publish the content by themselves for their online storefront. The problem with a lot of businesses is that, to save money, they outsource the content creation for extremely low rates. The quality of such content is not up to the mark. Now-a-days, good content is denoted by how much it is commented, shared and liked.

•	Not optimizing the content: Content promotion is not just posting the same content on several sites, but rather promoting the content through various mediums of optimization. These mediums for optimization include the use of social media, keyword usage in headline, meta title &amp; description and link building. Marketers can re-purpose the content and publish in different formats on different sites.

•	Results not measurable: Marketers need to understand that every content created for eCommerce shopping carts is not going to  generate good results in terms of likes it generates or the number of times it's going to be shared. They need to chalk out a plan about what specific goals they are going to achieve with their content marketing.
Content marketing is the foundation of a successful online marketing campaign. It will lead marketers &amp; online retailers to a successful campaign.

dropship,AMA Dropship Supplier,"Hi r/Dropship!
I've been an active member of the dropship community on reddit from the start and this seems like as good of a time as ever to host an AMA!

The dropship program that I manage is a division of a large wholesale import company.  We import over 5,000 unique SKUs and buy closeouts domestically (USA) as often as we can.  We've been in business for about 30 years and have a 250,000 sq ft warehouse.  

We provide our dropship data through either a CSV/XML download at no cost.  We don't believe in charging any fees, because our goal is to sell merchandise.  There is not a per order fee, restocking fee on returns, or any other fees that are associated with dropship orders including any upfront or sign up fees.  We also charge the real cost of shipping to our customers.

Our merchandise ranges across many categories: tools, toys, As Seen On TV, household goods, apparel, pet, painting supplies, etc etc.  Many of our goods are sold in the retail world for less than $5.  Of course, it does not make sense to dropship a product that retails for less than $5 so for many of our goods, we dropship by the case.  

On a separate note, we supply merchandise to many Daily Deal websites that sell our kinds of merchandise.

ecommerce,Product Uploading and Between Merchant Site Syncing: A Rant and Plea for Help,"/Commence Whining

I'm just about to rip my computer from the wall, drive over it repeatedly and retreat to the wilderness to live a tech-free life, felling trees and bathing in mountain streams, so help me god. I never want to look at another inventory page.


It seems like the simplest idea, the one every site trying to host you would start with from the get go: Upload your entire inventory easily and quickly. Maybe this happens between the sites, maybe they have a well thought out CSV importer easily available, maybe this is a third party app I'd have to pay whatever a month for (which I would, without hesitation). All I want is for my stores to sync. Fully. When I sell one thing, it is taken off the other site. When I add something to the inventory, it shows up in the other. The inventory of one mirrors the other. Sure, I'll tweak it if there are different features. I'll spend more time on getting it set on BigCommerce than Etsy, say, but the bare bones are there to get started with. 

I waste so much time uploading things to multiple sites, so much time waiting for images to load, switching back and forth betwee browser pages, copying and pasting until my pinkie and pointer finger are sore, and I'm just about at the end of my rope.


Every single customer rep says 'oh yeah, we do that!' and I get the free trial, and waste time tooling around trying to figure out how, and when I call back up (the same person, in some cases) they blatantly refute their previous claims! They tell me they didn't understand *that* was what I wanted. They don't do *that*. I couldn't have been more clear! Didn't we just spend a happy five minutes laughing about how useless your stupid software would be if it didn't do *that*? I thought you were my friend! So I cancel the trial amidst pleas of ""But we do so many other cool things!"" and I drown my sorrows in a whiskey, and weep on keyboard, and wake up the next morning with a million ""Please come back!"" emails with special offers or whatever.


/End Whining

Programmers: Make this thing. It is the grail. All of us handmaders are desperately searching for it. You will make millions. I would very, very, very happily pay up to $75-100/month for this mother. Which, added up over god knows how may frustrated Etsy-ers... 

Anyone: Has anyone come up with a good way of dealing with it? I've tried stitchlabs, merchpin, CSV importing and am unaware of any other options. I'd give up the automatic syncing just for an easy way to transfer products. I guess that's the main issue, the rest is just general annoyance that it can't automatically happen.",0,1,2013-03-09,ECOM,0.050357263535261154,0.9222331643104553,0.02740955725312233

ecommerce,Resizing website for different screen sizes,"An increase in the internet and mobile penetration has led the online retailers to design their eCommerce sites compatible with mobile devices. To increase the visibility of their webstore, online retailers  have made separate mobile websites. But with the increase in display technologies, nowadays, mobile devices are coming in different screen sizes.
To confront this issue, online retailers are crafting their sites on responsive web design.The responsive web design allows the web content to resize according to the device’s screen size. The concept of responsive web design emphasizes more on fitting content to various screen sizes instead of shaping the content to fit the value.
A responsive web design adjusts the width of the browser and adjust the content accordingly. The coding language transforms the site’s web presence. Since the websites are now accessible through multiple devices, the visitors get the optimal viewing experience. This easy access of information through various devices has led businesses across different sectors to opt for this responsive design.
But before opting for it, there are certain issues which online retailers need to consider like what is the difference which the responsive web design makes, how it is going to expand the online presence. Responsive design is definitely going to offer convenience. The content adjusts itself depending on the screen size and this helps in gathering information anytime &amp; from anywhere.
It also requires less code &amp; are usually preferred by most of the search engine sites. This ultimately leads to more uniform clicks. Besides from having a compatibility across various screen sizes, it is also helpful in search engine optimization. 
SEO Benefits-
Reducing the bounce rates: If the visitors are not able to access the websites through their mobile devices, they will go back to the result pages. This increases the bounce rates for the website. And ultimately, the Google will reduce the ranking of the site after considering the pattern of the visits to the site.Therefore, responsive web design also helps in optimizing the sites.
Leading traffic to one URL: Having a separate mobile site has its own advantages &amp; disadvantages. The owner of the site needs to optimize the URLs of both regular &amp;the mobile sites. But in case of responsive web design, optimization is done only for one URL &amp; this helps in avoiding confusion among the site visitors.
Using the prevalent inbound links: Google is using the pre-existing inbound links for ranking the websites in mobile search. Therefore, those sites that are using responsive web design gets higher ranks due to existing inbuilt links. This improves the SERPs functioning thus increasing the visibility among mobile users 
But having said that, there are a few hindrances while adopting this technology. 
CSS media queries limitation:To be compatible with a wide range of devices, the responsive design depends on CSS media queries. But in reality, majority of the devices are not matched with CSS media queries. 
Resizing images: Image resizing in the responsive web designing needlessly consumes CPU &amp; RAM.
Loading speed: Speed of loading sites on the mobile devices is less as compared to desktops. Responsive design doesn’t remove any Java Scripts or HTML codes. This makes the site slower on the mobile devices.
The responsive web design is definitely not a passing fad. It is going to stay but the site owners need to be considerate while opting for this technology.

ecommerce,Best Resources for Learning How to Find Potential Products to Sell?,"So I know this may be a question that in various forms comes up on here, /r/dropshipping, /r/entrepreneur, and others from time to time. For about 3 months I've been reading all about ecommerce platforms, best price ranges, integrating shipping costs, and marketing practices and have learned so much. I've read 4 Hour Work Week after a lot of people pointed others there and have found a few ebooks as well that gave great general input on ecommerce in general as well as dropshipping and selling from wholesalers. 
 
My big hang up is that I know what the right product qualities are but am honestly struggling with researching products from there. I have started with browsing around on Amazon and Ebay but think I may be doing this wrong since I still feel so far from actually coming up with a product to test myself with. 
 
Basically I'm looking for some advice on how you got started right off the bat. I'm sure many of you KNEW what you wanted to sell and just needed the guidance but I'm kind of stuck there - bad position of wanting so badly to jump in but not knowing what direction to point my efforts in. 
 
I'd like to go towards something that is more simple to work with at first and also sells for that sweet spot of ~$100-$200 that I keep reading about though. That's really where I want to put my efforts. 
 
I have a lot of experience in general SEO and site design but that's not lending itself too well (yet) to my research. 
 
Can any of you give me some step by step advice on how you research new products or point me in a good direction? I admit that I may just be at the ""execute on SOMETHING"" stage but I have read so much and feel a bit frozen up on acting and need to know where to put my passion. 
 
I welcome harsh advice and kind advice alike and really appreciate any input your own success may lend. 
 
Lastly, good luck with your own ventures all.",0,1,2013-03-21,ECOM,0.02821502834558487,0.8947508931159973,0.0770341157913208

ecommerce,Is it possible to have an affiliate program automatically pay venders when someone buys their product through my checkout?,"I'm using WooCommerce. 

I'm creating a site which (for now) will exclusively sell digital goods, the majority of which will be affiliate products. 

I want to get people on board and let me handle the payments, so that I can put them through my checkout and payment system, rather than have customers be redirected to their sales pages. It means more money for me (upsells), and lower cart abandonment rate as when they click on add to cart, they're more likely to pay. 

The problem is that because their product is going to be in my store, and delivered by me, there's nowhere for me to add an affiliate link. I think?

The only thing I can think of is that I could maybe have a registration page which will register them as an affiliate when they go to access the product after purchase? 

Bit of a long shot I know, but there's so many affiliate programs to choose from, it's hard to know where to start. 

Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks! Josh",0,1,2013-03-31,ECOM,0.020664898678660393,0.9207159280776978,0.058619122952222824
