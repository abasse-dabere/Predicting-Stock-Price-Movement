ecommerce,Thoughts on migrating my brand from influencer/FB/IG marketing to an affiliate platform?,"So I have a [fashion accessory product](http://upsidehats.com/) (created from the ground up, entirely unique, and fully set up on Shopify with a fulfillment warehouse) that I’ve been selling via FB/IG ads, as well as direct outreach to influencers. People seem to love it, and we have a lot of repeat customers and organic spread. The problem is it’s a product that didn’t exist before so we need to create awareness and demand as well as validation (be it from network/peers or influencers).

Our ads do ok, usually 2-10% of people click which I’m told is pretty good, but only a small portion of those convert to a sale —not enough to make the campaigns consistently under-cost.

The influencer approach has been somewhat successful, as people definitely buy our product via their posts —however it’s just not sustainable to constantly research and reach out to people when most don’t reply and those that do often want up front $$ instead of commission.

Many people have told me the product is a natural fit for affiliate marketing as it’s fun, social, unique, cheap, and quality. I’ve researched different platforms and applied to many, and was mostly rejected as we don’t make close to the $1Mil/yr sales many of the top sites require. I’ve only been able to find 3 options that may work: shareasale, link connector, and flexoffers.

I feel a bit like I’m in over my head here. I’ve never done this before and am not even really sure what I’m getting into as there are lots of options, all of which seem to cost around $500 just to try the platform and see how it works. We are willing to pay up to 50% commission (close to our break even) just to increase awareness with more product out in the wild.

What do you guys think? Should we just pick one of those platforms and go from there or is there another avenue/platform we should consider?",3,6,2019-10-01,ECOM,0.024004442617297173,0.9275615811347961,0.04843397065997124

* You can use Messenger retargeting to recover abandoned carts
* You can install an ""exit pop-up"" with a discount code to recover abandoned carts

dropship,10 Step Dropshipping Guide (Beginners),"1. Learn as much as you can about sales and marketing FIRST before starting a store.
2. Study top stores as much as possible. Study the ads, product descriptions, branding, store setup etc.
3. Choose a product that will actually impact peoples lives that is not too saturated in the dropship space. Just scroll through ali dropship center to find a product. Once found verify the product with ali dropship center analytics tool. Don't sell a product with less then 50 orders a day. Then verify again with google trends.
4. Create a professional store referencing top ecom brands. Actually put time and effort into it and if you have the budget hire a developer to help. Anyone who says ""don't spend too much time on your store front"" is a liar. Your storefront and product is really what will convert your traffic.
5. Setup the backend, email marketing and messenger marketing will 9 times out of 10 be 30% of your sales. So don't forget it.
6. Create a compelling ads with fb using the conversion purchase objective. Don't know what makes a good ad then scroll through fb and look at ads that have gotten over 1 mill views and tons of engagement. Study what their videos look like, what the ad copy looks like etc. Short ad copy that is straight to the point and a short video that talks about benefits of  product tend to do the best.
7. YOU NEED TO TEST TEST TEST. Marketing is all about testing. Each adset should have 4 or more different ads so you can see which works best. Test ad copy, thumbnails, videos, pictures, everything..
8. Keep up with your customer support. No one likes bad support, if you need to hire a VA.
9. Once you reach 100 orders start thinking about turning your store into a brand. Custom packaging, logos on products and fulfillment centers. This is when your dropshipping store turns into an actual business asset. One that you can sell in the future. Dropshipping should only be used to verify a product sells. Once verified you need to fulfill orders with a warehouse and start branding.
10. Scale to the moon. Keep testing, test influencers, LAA, retargeting. Get creative.

dropship,My story and dropshipping journey so far,"Entered the world of dropshipping sometime this year while googling ""how to make money"" lmao.

My background is: I'm an electronics and communication engineer from India. After graduation me and a couple of friends started up a company for artists to find gigs and stuff. We organized loads of gigs hoping to make it big but we failed big time. So after 3 years of edge survival in the market we decided to call it quits because the amount of efforts we had to put to keep the company afloat were enormous and the model wasn't working well.

We all got jobs in a Machine Learning and A.I. services company (yes all in the same company, luck I believe) as programmers and business analysts. Decent pay, good work environment , but it's still a job and it doesn't feel as close and personal and independent as we aspire to live.. Hence we kept our eyes on the lookout for anything that could help us take off again.

We came across dropshipping and instantly fell in love with the concept. After researching for a few months we finally boiled down to a concept and a niche and have our first dropshipping store in place.

We are targeting Women 18-35 United States interested in fitness, exercise, yoga, sportswear etc.

UPDATE Oct7,
This awesome community pointed out a lot of nitty gritty stuff that I corrected. Our first set of ads weren't successful at all. On a total spend of $30 all we could gather was reach of about 5k. Link clicks happened and people did land on the page but we didn't even get a genuine add to cart, and it's scary.

I will keep posting updates about my journey in this post in the hopes that this awesome community will help me get this store big and help me quit this job so I can go back to the thrill of working for myself. I will be eternally indebted to everyone helping me out with my journey.

dropship,Is It Better To Dropship Products That Are Already Doing Well Or To Find Your Own Product,"Hello, I’m going to be starting drop shipping and I’ve been watching many YouTube videos on it.

ecommerce,How to make more money off instagram?,"Okay so this is a bit controversial. Long story short, I am 14. I am on my way to stable income by the end of the year (hopefully). Gotta dream big to make big, you know? But yeah, currently I have an instagram page with over 11k followers, my posts all gets over 500k views and average 30k+ likes at least. Along with couple of posts hitting over 1 million views. I am currently part of a program that pays you everytime someone downloads an app through your link. I just started 2 days ago and so far I have made $60 off it. Which is around $20-$30 a day on autopilot. Furthermore, businesses are hitting me up which adds onto around $50-$100 most days (not everyday, so it's unstable). Obviously, I wanted to ask if there's any other way to generate more income and turn it to stable? I have monthly bills of around $200 to pay off - you might ask why, well all the money I am making off instagram right now is going towards to e-commerece store. The store itself is generating profit but not enough to pay monthly to keep the store up and running (possibly because I am unable to run FB ads atm). But yeah, if there's any way I can make more income from instagram then please let me know! Thanks.",25,21,2019-10-05,ECOM,0.022617120295763016,0.9199197292327881,0.05746318772435188

ecommerce,Facebook Commerce is driving me crazy!,"I'm new to the Facebook Commerce (the Shop tab on a business page) platform, but I'm not terribly new to e-commerce in general. I haven't had a transaction yet on Facebook -- mostly still building my inventory system and catalog for a resell side thing -- but the platform is driving me bananas.

I have a few gripes about it that I want to share them with fellow e-commerce entrepreneurs to see if I'm just overreacting or if these are some legitimate grievances...

For one, [Facebook forces you to have a return policy.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/612828795802804) You **must** have a *minimum* 30 day return policy and **must** respond to requests with 2 business days. While most businesses probably do have a return policy and response time quotas, these seems a bit of an overreach on Facebook's part.  Outside of items covered by [""Purchase Protection""](https://www.facebook.com/policies/purchase_protection) (which should be opt-in), the business who owns the store should be able to control their own policies.

Facebook also [dictates your shipping polices](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/211403042968780) and currently restricts you to **ONE** shipping rate. **ONE. SHIPPING. RATE.** *For those in the back: ONE RATE.* We aren't Amazon; most of us can't afford to pay a flat rate of shipping. In my situation, I have a huge variety of products from 3-oz cosmetics to 4-lb sheet set. Right now, I adjust the price of my item to accommodate the shipping. But if Amazon can get it right with it's third-party sellers... 

Every product you add to your Facebook Commerce catalog (and Marketplace, too, I believe) must be ""individually"" reviewed (by a person?!) to ensure it [complies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/commerce) with their rules -- perfectly fine, I've dealt with much [harsher polices with Shopify Payments](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms-payments-us#prohibited-businesses). However, only about 75% of my products get approved within a few minutes, but there's some that have been pending approval for for over 9 days. 

For those that are still processing, support's answer is to just wait. ""If your product complies with our policies, we'll approve it and it'll appear in your shop within 24 hours. Please keep in mind that some products take longer to review."" Every support case I've opened has the same canned message.

Other products have been rejected... Hemp oil for pets for being illegal (it's not), weight scale for unknown reasons, a flashlight for being a weapon (with that logic, all products are weapon), and others where they've just removed the product after an hour or so. You can [appeal the rejection](https://www.facebook.com/help/2193854224216494?ref=cp), but good luck -- I've been waiting over a week.  

(Granted, my issues with the product reviews is probably an outlying case. I have 300+ single stock products that I'm reselling. Marketplace would probably be a better place for it, but I like doing it on a business page to make things easier -- I was already posting eBay listings on there and sharing Marketplace listings to a news feed has issues in and of itself.)

All this being said, I can appreciate the fact that Facebook Commerce is there... It's another channel to sell on to an audience you may not find on eBay or elsewhere.

For those of you who use Facebook Commerce, what's your take on this? How has your experience been so far? Are you seeing similar issues or am I an outlier in all these issues?",6,13,2019-10-05,ECOM,0.060997024178504944,0.9120101928710938,0.026992695406079292

dropship,"So, I'm officially starting tomorrow. Here's my plan and tell me your thoughts","I chose my shop name, which means ""marketplace"" in another language, sounds italian but it's not, it's short  and ""fun"" to pronounce. Only problem is most people won't know the meaning of it, but I don't think that matters as a business name. I will use a clean simple template on shopify.

I'm going to select 4-5 products in the beauty and well being niche.  They are all fairly popular products. I already have a good idea which those will be but will run google trends to make sure I select the best of the best.

I will be using shopify and oberlo. As far as ads go, and because i don't have lot of money for ads right now, I plan to spend $100 a week and I'm not sure if I'll do fb ads or use ig influencers-i think fb will be easier to get me started.  I will probably just use stock images for my ads, will then order the products myself to take my own pics and create a video (I know a video is better than pics, but I just want to get started so that's out of the way, before I focus on making video ads).

Questions that I have: 
1. Can i use my personal bank account to sign up on paypal and oberlo, I plan to get seller's permit once I have some sales, and i think i need a business permit to open a business account.

2. Do I need to contact any of the suppliers directly to tell them i like to do business with them? Or do I simply send over the orders once I make sales?

ecommerce,Celebrity-owned eCommerce business idea – thoughts? Is it viable?,"I've been toying with a business idea that I think has potential, but a pivotal part of the business lies in a field that I'm not as experienced in.

A bit of a background of what I do know and understand – social media and influencer &amp; celebrity relations. I've managed some of the industry's largest influencer campaigns on behalf of over a dozen eCommerce brands. A good portion of my experience in this space was gained at one company that owned (through in-house dev. or acquisition) seven eCommerce brands. I've also been able to build relationships with some of the biggest influencers, celebrities, and talent agencies.

Celebrity-owned brands are a growing trend. I'm wondering if teaming up with celebrities and mega-influencers to start eCommerce brands off the back of their fame and audiences could make a viable business model. Ideally, these eCommerce businesses would require less capital to start than typical eCommerce businesses, because stakeholders would receive equity &amp; rev share in the company in exchange for their help in getting it off the ground and the celebrities help to reduce marketing expenditure because they already have access to millions of people online. 

Essentially, this would be like building mini Kylie Cosmetics brands at scale. Here are a couple things I'm not 100% confident in:

* The structure of the organization would need to be strategic: 
   * I'm wondering if there can be a team that's devoted to operating, managing, and maintaining eCommerce brands **after** they've been developed, built, and launched. The idea is that these would be developers, digital marketers, brand managers that can manage several brands under one roof. These would be full-time paid staff.
   * There would then be a more devoted team that would specialize in building eCommerce brands from scratch, where they focus on one (or only a couple) of projects until they're ready to launch. These could be contracted or freelance positions.
* I've built basic eCommerce Shopify stores before, but is it reasonable to expect to find talent who will build and launch expertly crafted eCommerce stores without any guarantee of return – even if this is a side-hustle or part-time job for them?
* What kind of equity will I be able to afford to give celebrities, developers, marketers, etc?
* How much work is involved in managing an eCommerce store from day to day? Obviously this depends on what products are being sold, but let's suppose these are fairly basic in nature. Clothing brands, accessories, water bottles, iphone cases, etc. Typically things that can be sourced on Alibaba, with some branding, a story, and a logo.  


&amp;#x200B;

I know there is something here, but it will need some work. I know of successful companies that are hired to develop brands which are paid for by larger parent companies. I also know that celebrities are able to monetize their large audiences by selling their own branded products. This idea is essentially bringing the brand development in-house, giving all early stakeholders a piece of the pie, and then doing so at scale. The business model would be gaining equity in the brands, and royalties/rev share.

ecommerce,Should one focus on content creation or SEO?

I'm hoping that if I were to work on the content, then by virtue of the fact that I am creating so much content related to my niche, that the content will be able to take care of any shortcomings related with SEO / keywords etc - by building a community of people who will regularly be coming back to the site, which will then end up resulting in Google having to recognise the site more.

shopify,A brief post on mindset,"YouTube gurus actually do give some great advice and can be inspiring to watch and listen to. However, it seems to be more and more common that people are jumping in and getting depressed when they ""fail"" at their stores. There is an especially large number of people here who are still in high school, so here is some useful advice not only for Shopify/eCommerce but that will serve you extremely well for life in general. Feel free to disagree, but it's a really simple framework for what I personally use.

* Learn quickly. Try to learn as objectively as possible. Rely on \*multiple\* smart people's opinions, your own experiments, and whatever you read. Get data.
* Reflect often on what you've done, how it performed, and how it could be better
* Record your reflections and learnings
* Implement something slightly better each day, or take one step closer to success

...sounds simple, right? Well, it is, and it's basically a way to make success as inevitable as it can be.

If you think it's not, then a basic thought experiment is to think about it in the third person.

Let's say you have a person named Sarah. She's just started learning about eCommerce. She:

* Watches YouTube videos about successful dropshipping stores
* Makes one herself on Shopify
* It fails after $200 of ad spend

So if the story ended there, and she gave up, then \*obviously\* she won't be successful. There's a minuscule chance she'll get lucky on the first go. But that's not the overwhelming majority of people.

Let's expand the story a little bit.

* Watches YouTube videos about successful dropshipping stores
* Makes one herself on Shopify
* It fails after $200 of ad spend
* She wonders if her problem is related to the number of people converting on her website? So she Googles ""how to increase Shopify conversion rate""
* After reading 3 articles, she comes across a tool called HotJar which lets her watch screen recordings of her users as they browse her website
* She realises that most people don't even scroll past the images to read her carefully crafted description!
* She therefore spends more time on photography and updates her pictures. They are beautifully optimised.
* Despite this, she still doesn't make a profit, however her conversion rate has improved 2x.

...most people sort of get up to this stage of optimising a bit, then giving up after they've had enough or can't see it being successful.

But the thing is: you can see the trend, right?

Even after a single day of improvement, she's a bit closer to her goal. Sometimes you go forwards, and sometimes you may even go backwards.

But for each single bullet point, her knowledge base has increased slightly, shifting her in the correct direction. It's also critical that it's rooted in reality rather than delusion.

I usually hate motivational posts because they're full of fluff and crap. Talking about ""the hustle"", or whatever. But this is a different piece of advice, because I'm directly saying that this is something you can implement \*today\*, and you'll already have started to change just by having read it.

Your goals change - from thinking ""I need $1000"" - which on the majority of days won't happen - to ""I need to learn as much as I can"" - which will literally happen every single day - then you can see for yourself which one makes you happier. But you can also very clearly see which one is also going to bring you closer towards success each day.

Things take time and mini-failures. That's totally fine. It's part of the process. We \*all\* suffer through that stage at some point in our journey.

But if you thought about \*someone else who's not yourself\* who 1. kept learning, 2. didn't give up, 3. put in effort - and do that day after day after day after day...then the rational thing is to think that person would inevitably become successful. It'd actually be irrational to think otherwise. I feel like they'd also feel pretty happy, since they have so many mini-successes in their life too - the success of becoming a step closer to success.

It's basically a universal tool for getting better at everything.

Hope it helps others for as much as it's helped me. (I have nothing to plug and no financial incentive from writing this post.)",7,15,2019-10-08,ECOM,0.0432404987514019,0.9086633920669556,0.04809609800577164

I believe its about always keep trying and improving. But the thing is that I these words are too generic. Do you advice someone specific to lsn to? A ""guru""?

shopify,"My Google Ad Has 7.46% CTA from 3,513 Impression , but I Can't Get More Click !","Hi all

Let's summarize the problems and background here

I'm confused with 8-12% CTR , 8/10 Quality Score , No.1 / No.2 market share on Google ad , but no 100 clicks get in my site every day (only 10 to 20 actually) , and by the way , the keyword i target has 6k to 10k to 40k monthly searches.

It confuses me coz I've done most optimization and work i learnt from online sources but the result is nothing ...

For worse , even i increased  click budget , the click didn't increase but the CPC increase ...

I've set up several ad campaign and ad group since 30/08/2019 and i'm selling sex toys which i can't use display ad , youtube ad , gmail ad etc but search ad &amp; shopping look okay. 

I've tried strategies like separate main keyword in main ad group , location , negative keyword

ecommerce,Basic Website Conversion Tips,"Hey folks,

Over the past week, I've been helping some entrepreneurs optimize their sites for conversions. I've found most of these entrepreneurs on Reddit and have noticed **three common areas in which most of these sites struggle**. I thought I'd create a post about them to help out anyone who might be struggling with conversions.

# The Hero Image Section

When I talk about the hero image, I'm speaking about the very first block on your home page. Right below your navigation bar.

The hero image is the first thing your traffic sees, and should be reserved for your most important piece of content. People want to know what your site is about the moment it loads up. And **only \~24% of your traffic is going to scroll to the bottom of your page**. You need to grab attention right away.

*I'll put a link to some data on how people scroll in the comments.*

So how do you grab attention right away? Focus on three things:

1. Make sure you have a headline and a subheadline that captures the problem your product solves. These should be succinct. Your headline should be no longer than 8 words, and your subheadline no longer than 15.
2. Have an attractive CTA that plays off the headline and subheadline copy. The copy above the CTA should present the problem, and the CTA should present your product as the solution.
3. Have a background image that aligns with the solution your target audience wants. Got a store that sells fishing bait? Have a hero image of a man fishing peacefully with a beer. A women's formal clothing store? A woman attracting attention in a formal setting. The main point is to give your target audience an image they secretly (or overtly) desire so they can visualize themselves in said image. And hence visualize themselves using your product.

There's plenty more I could go into in regards to hero images, but if you focus on those three things (and make sure your hero image picture isn't taken with a flip phone) you should have somewhere to start.

# CTA Placement

The next thing I often pick up on is that most home pages don't have enough CTAs. Hell, some of the ones I've seen recently don't even have a CTA in the hero image. If your website doesn't have a CTA in the hero image go put one in right now.

Now, just because I'm saying most websites don't have enough CTAs doesn't mean you should put CTAs in every spot imaginable. Rather, you need to strike a balance between giving people the option to click to the sales page, and coming across as scammy. Make no mistake about it, too many CTAs can, and will, come across as scammy.

*I'll leave a link to a post about* *how many CTAs you should have, and what the different types of CTAs are* *in the comments.*

Here are a few tips for your CTAs:

1. Make sure no more than one CTA is visible at any point on your page.
2. Personalize your CTAs. This makes them convert twice as well. *I'll source that in the comments.*
3. Think about the best way to structure the CTAs on your site. Do you want to hit your audience with a high commitment CTA like 'contact us' right away? Is that a good idea for your product? Or is it a better idea to hit them with a low commitment CTA like 'check out this free thing that helps you but gives me your email' in your hero image? It's up to you and there's no one size fits all answer.

# Social Proof

Most of us make online purchasing decisions based on social proof. *I'll leave a link to a study that backs that up in the comments.*

**So that means that if your homepage has no form of social proof you're at a huge disadvantage.**

You need to think about the kinds of social proof that work best for your industry, and then you need to make sure that kind of proof is on your page. If you're stuck, look at what your biggest competitors use for social proof.

*I'll leave a link to* *a HubSpot* *article that might help get your gears turning* *in the comments.*

There are no real tips I can give for social proof, you either have it, and do it well, or you don't. And if you don't then you likely aren't converting as well as you could be.

I hope that helps some of you.

One other thing I noticed as I was reviewing sites is that many people could stand to better understand sales copywriting. I didn't include it as a main tip as it's hard to summarize and give pointers for. But if you're struggling with copywriting then **try to imagine your target audience as the protagonist in a story**. Most businesses mess up by thinking that they're the protagonist. We're not the main character, we're the guides. **They're Hercules, and we're the weird short centaur that guides them to excellence**. Start with the main problem that your protagonist is facing, then think about how you can position your product as a path to their eventual fulfilment. Basically, set up a problem and then give them your product as the solution.",11,31,2019-10-12,ECOM,0.06767160445451736,0.9015932679176331,0.030735165812075138

dropship,A Dropshipping Solution Offering 2 Day Shipping,"Hey guys! We are a small team of software engineers, marketers and entrepreneurs. We are currently working on a Dropshipping tool for Dropshippers that will focus on the customer's experience, leaving you to focus on building your brand. Our Dropshipping solution aims to provide Dropshippers with all the necessary tools to maintain a competitive edge against bigger retailers by offering:

* Quality Products - We know, Dropshipping from Alibaba and other similar platforms can be a pain in the ass, and products take forever to arrive and the quality can sometimes (if not all the time) be shitty. Customers are most likely to not make any repeat purchases since their experience with your brand has been aggravating. We want to offer quality products that have been hand-picked by us to satisfy your customer's needs.
* 2 Day Free Shipping  - Offering 2-Day Free Shipping creates trust between you and your customer, it instantly satisfies their need for immediate gratification. Put yourself in your customer's shoes, how would you feel if your order took 21 days to arrive? We want to offer 2-day free shipping to create an experience for your customers that will help your brand.
* Free Returns - I don't even need to go into details regarding this feature. If a customer sees that you're offering free returns, they are more likely to make a purchase since you are making business between you and them easier, they have nothing to lose.
* Verified Reviews - This feature helps your customers have an idea regarding the product that they are going to purchase off of your store.
* Heat Map - This tool will give you an idea of how customers are using your site, providing you accurate data that you can use to improve your site's user interface to enhance your customer's experience.
* Other Tools to Enhance Customer Experience - We are going to constantly improve our tool and add new features that will help you create a better experience for your customers.

Our goal is to create a one-stop Dropshipping solution for Dropshippers that offers them all the necessary tools to control the whole customer journey pipeline. You can Dropship products, understand your customer's behavior, support your customers, create a customer experience, and so much more.

We will soon be open to beta testers, and if you guys are interested you can DM me your email and I will add you to the list. Our Dropshipping tool will be a premium service, we have yet to determine the price, however, we are making an exception for our beta testers, and they will have a free membership for life.

What do you guys think?

However, the only solution to acquire or you can say **earn** **PayPal trust** (being on the safer side) is by uploading order shipment information for each transaction on PayPal and being **100% upfront with them.**

That’s why I with my team created **UpTrack - A PayPal Account Guard**

It has got &amp; will help you

* 3 Ways to Sync Tracking Information
* Win Potential Disputes &amp; Chargebacks
* Reduce Holds, Reserves, and Limitations
* No Tracking Based Charges or Credits

UpTrack Works under Secured API PayPal &amp; Shopify Servers so you won't need any Subaccount or anything.

**Why I created UpTrack When there are already so many GOOD apps for syncing tacking from Shopify to PayPal?**

1. Major reason being **""Price"", they charge ridiculously, 0.1$ per tracking sync, which is 2,000$ for 20,000 Tracking???** Well, when I was scaling my fashion brand, I ended up paying thousands every week to those apps. For just syncing the info with PayPal!  
Well, that's crazy I am not here to badmouth anyone!
2. The second reason can be the lack of customized sync or custom features. Herewith UpTrack you can sync with ***Date based***, **Desired** ***Order Id Based*** or ***Automatically every 20 mins*****!** \- **Isn't that wow?**
3. **UpTrack is affordable reliable to everyone -** You can Sync literally **200,000 Tracking to PayPal at just 50 bucks** \- **Awesome right?**

dropship,This has been on my mind for a while now...,"This may seem like more of a ramble than an organized thought, but we'll see what comes out of my head. 😂

I began trying to dropship over three years ago, over that time I've had a few small successes (a few hundred dollars here and there) until last summer. 

I had taken about a three month break and decided to just focus on my day-job as I was getting aggravated with not having huge success with dropshipping. 

Last June I decided to give it another go... Except this time, I was looking in from a totally new perspective. Instead of viewing it as ""Dropshipping"" which I feel is the way most folks do, I began looking at it as the base form of what it is - eCommerce. Instead of focusing on finding good products (not even winning products), I focused on building a store and settling it into an already existing community. 

In 30 days, from June 23rd to July 23rd I managed to do over $1,700 in sales and over $1,000 profit WITHOUT paid advertising or paid shoutouts, only using Instagram. (It wasn't long after this that I quit my job and began focusing on it full-time). 

Now back to what this post is about....

I think wayy to many people are focused on the ""dropshipping"" aspect instead of the ""building a business"" aspect. Most of us know that a lot of the community expects to throw up and store and make hundreds of thousands of dollars (thanks gurus!), but I think it goes even deeper than that and steers people away from the processes/thought processes it takes to build a business online. 

Don't think of it as ""Dropshipping"", think of it as regular commerce (you know, like a vendor at a mall or a local business you randomly come across and buy stuff from), except with an online store front. Then focus on what you wanna sell, who you wanna sell it to, and put it in front of them. 

Not sure if this made sense at all - hopefully someone gets it and it helps change their perspective.",62,75,2019-10-15,ECOM,0.033814821392297745,0.9239210486412048,0.042264148592948914
shopify,"June/July = $21k combined. August/September = $130k combined, October on track for $150k. Here’s what it takes and I’ll be brutally honest…","[Quick Proof](https://imgur.com/a/11ilWGO)

Here’s what it takes:

1. **Math Skills** – Most people can’t do quick math in their head, let alone some slightly more complicated math involving percentages and multi-step problems. This is a key component to my success because I’ve been able to quickly understand the numbers and know if things are going well or not, how to scale, and a whole host of other things related to e-commerce.
2. **English** – Most people also do not natively speak English, and most that do, show a lot of amateur mistakes in their grammar/spelling. It’s also evident you’re not a professional company in the way your website, descriptions, and blogs are written out.
3. **Good Taste** – Another common one that most people THINK they have but definitely DON’T! So. Many. Ugly. Websites! Frankly, this is something you don’t know you lack in until someone brutally tells it to your face. Even then, there are people in denial, stubbornness to change, etc. Even if you do accept the fact, there is usually very little you can do immediately to change this about yourself. Most people try to copy other designs and websites, which leads me to the next point.
4. **Originality** – So many new store owners are EXTREMELY unoriginal and don’t even know or care! If you think you can copy ideas and get rich off that, think again! Put in a LOT of work to create something new and original that customers would stop scrolling on their Facebook feed to look at!
5. **Risking Money** – This one is probably one of the most common things I see and why I usually refuse to work with other entrepreneurs/wantrepreneurs. 99% of people I’ve spoken with to team up have told me that they simply don’t have the money or willingness to risk the money they do have. Honestly, good! If you are uncomfortable doing that, the BEST THING FOR YOUR WELLBEING IS NOT TO RISK YOUR MONEY! Just come to terms with that and don’t dive into business so suddenly. Get a job, save up, and figure out your life first and business later! Be safe people! Don’t go begging successful people to teach you for free either! Lol

What I see in this sub is the following character. Read this description and be honest with yourself. Is this me? Do even a few of these things apply to you? Yeah? Well, I’ve got bad news for you…

You’re young (Under 25) and are sick of working for someone else because you think you’re so smart and can create a business that could pay you way more! You don’t have a lot of money (under $5,000 saved up) but you’re willing to put in the sweat equity so you KNOW you’re gonna be successful anyways! Hell yeah! You just looked up a YouTube video and saw how easy dropshipping is and how much you can make! But you know nothing about facebook ads… Oh well, you’ll give it a shot and just see if it works. Ok, now you’ve paid for sooo many facebook ads and get sooo much traffic but no sales. Well, here’s something I learned first hand: I burned through about $10,000 in my first month before figuring out what works and what to scale! After that, I started making huge profits (hundreds or thousands of dollars in profit a day consistently). So if you can’t bear that thought, I’d drop out now and save the heartache. Of course, I am an extreme example but most people will burn through a few thousand dollars first before making money. But that’s just business…

If you have more questions, comment and I’ll try to get to as many as I can! Not interested in sharing too much detail on my successes though because I don’t want to create direct competition. Also, I’m not interested in partnering with most people. I usually only consider people with an established business/website and larger fb ads budgets and willing to pay my hourly rate, which is not cheap by any means because I work on ads AND website design/processes. I know that eliminates most/all people reading this 😊 I just wanted to share some knowledge with everyone to help out those who have potential!",69,63,2019-10-15,ECOM,0.07173482328653336,0.9013012647628784,0.02696390263736248
ecommerce,Wix have fucked me.,"Never deal with Wix.

I've been fortunate enough to get a high quantity of sales to my jewellery store and I've been very happy with customer feedback and the smoothness of the payments...until now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The way that Wix works is that when a payment is made via Card and not Paypal then the amount goes into a 'Wix Wallet' that is added to throughout the week and is paid out to a bank account on Mondays. I was told to send in verification of my ID for this process as well as connecting a bank account and I did that in the first month of owning the site.  I was told to wait a few days for the account to be verified. It took a week before it was rejected due to the photo of my ID being 'Too blurry'. Fair enough, I uploaded another photo and a month later after 4-5 45 minute phone calls I've had my ID validated but then they've told me they're investigating the products I'm selling. Unfortunately for me I've already been taking orders during this period and have amassed around £1,500 in my Wix wallet alone, the other half has been going straight to my Paypal which thankfully has been my rock through all of this. Anyway, this £1,500 is now in purgatory as Wix have only now informed me via telephone not to send out any of these orders until my account is approved and I can get this money. I had already shipped out a good £1,200 worth of orders and now am lost waiting until they review my products and confirm that everything is okay to move forward with.

Now, this is where it gets irritating. The awkward products were a series of Necklaces that feature genuine 925 Sterling Silver as well as Cubic Zirconian Diamonds (Real Silver, Fake Diamonds) and because I didn't have the exact documentation required in terms of certificates for the diamonds and silver they've put everything on hold already. However I hadn't yet sold any of these items meaning that £1,500 has been put on hold even longer.

It gets worse when revealed that if I get any unhappy customers after breaking the news of their new indefinite wait time I have to refund them. However people are making chargebacks without even communicating with me and a new e-mail I've just received is that every time a chargeback is made I have to wait 30 days until the money is available for me again. Meaning that of the 80 something customers involved with the £1,500 only 1 person has to chargeback before I'm forced to wait 30 days. This already happened once, the extra 30 days has caused another person to chargeback, I now have to wait 80 days. What. The. Fuck. How do I get out of this trap. 

Their customer service replies once a day with an automated message. They don't have a phone number that you can call, you have to request a callback if they deem your problem worthy enough. They then make you wait 45 minute hold times in the hopes that you'll just give up and then give you no answers when they do talk to you. I really need help resolving this as I'm going to have to put the entire venture on hold for the meantime.

Any help is appreciated, anyone in here that works for Wix question your life choices.",34,42,2019-10-15,ECOM,0.04812012240290642,0.9224717020988464,0.029408201575279236

shopify,$500K Selling A Posture Brace With Facebook ™ Ads [Drop-shipping Case Study],"**$500K Selling A Posture Brace With Facebook ™ Ads \[Drop-shipping Case Study\]**

This is a case study on a recent store of mine that focused on selling a posture brace.

This will focus on the ads strategy side. I'll post another with the product research side for those who are interested.

&gt;\*\*Our numbers:\*\*$528,000 in sales after accounting for returns$300,000 in ad spend between the two ad accounts$79,0000 in COGSThis left us with roughly $149,000 in profit or 28% profit margins. Not bad for two months on one product.

**5 PHASE ADS STRATEGY**

This strategy is broken down into 5 easy phases that will work great for anyone trying to run a 1-product store. As a bonus, I’ll also be going over how to get around Facebook disabling ad accounts because that’s what happened multiple times while running this store.

But before we get started with Phase 1, let’s go over the creatives or video ads we used.

What we did with this ad was first come up with the basic format. Starting from a spin around, going into an animation, and finally ending with the benefits &amp; features.

Along with the standard sequence, we came up with a caption that we pretty much used for all of our tests. The ad focused on convincing people that the brace is effective for good posture, it doesn’t waste time telling them why good posture is important because people who need a posture brace already know the importance of good posture.

Once we had our standard sequence, we came up with a few different intros and used them to start the sequence.

To find the clips for this ad, we took videos from Aliexpress listings and also used a few clips from dropshipping videos. It’s pretty easy to find old dropshipping ads on youtube if you search for your product.

You should be careful taking videos from people though, and use common sense to avoid getting in trouble. Don’t take videos from popular youtube videos and make sure to come up with your own content once you know something is working.

Another great option we use for original video content is Fiverr. Not only can you get people to demonstrate your product, but you can also get 3D animations done for pretty cheap. If you’re looking for models, look up “product video” or “product model”, and if you’re looking for product animations look up “3D product animation”.

Now, before you start Phase 1, make sure you have 1 basic video sequence with three different intros. When you’re picking out your intro, make sure it’s something eye catchy that will stop someone from scrolling. If you need inspiration, just look at the ads on your newsfeed and pay attention to what gets the most views.

**PHASE 1 - TESTING PROCESS ROUND 1**

The campaign and adset structure for this phase and all of the phases that follow are very similar. Refer back to this point when you’re setting up ads for each phase and use these settings.

All of the phases use campaigns with buying type set to auction and objective set to conversions. We turn campaign budget optimization on and set bid strategy to lowest cost. The daily budget depends on the phase that you’re in.

For adsets, we optimize for purchase, and set new adsets to start the next day.

For location, we target our special ePacket list which can be found in the facebook group.

We let facebook decide the age and gender for the most part, but we will sometimes end up narrowing that down if we see performance for certain demographics underperforming.

When we’re starting ads though, we almost always just let facebook decide. Even if we’re selling a men’s product, we’ve noticed that Facebook can still find female buyers for us - especially as campaigns optimize. Language should always be set to English(all) unless you’re running ads in a foreign language.

For detailed targeting, or interest targeting as we like to call it, we make sure to exclude dropshipping as an interest. This is going to help hide your product and store from other dropshippers looking to sell the same product.

The interests we include change for each phase, and we don’t include any interests when we’re targeting Custom or Lookalike audiences.

We leave placements on auto, optimization on conversions, and conversion window on 7 day view 1 day click.

Using those settings in Phase 1, we set a daily campaign budget of $200. If that’s too expensive, you can use a smaller budget than we did, but in that case, just test less adsets.

We test 10 adsets with our $200 budget, so if you have a $100 budget, you should test 5 adsets.

For our 10 adsets in this campaign, we targeted interests related to posture.

The interests I used included Vertebral column, shoulder, neck, spinal cord, poor posture, cervical vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, aging, massage, and old age.

Note: You shouldn’t think too hard about what to target, just pick something broad with at least a few million people that you think might work. Then use the suggestions feature to find more interests once you have a few in mind that you want to target.

For our initial tests, I started with poor posture which is an obvious fit for the product, and then used suggestions to find the rest.

When you’re going through these suggestions, make sure the majority of your audiences have at least 5m people. Some of my interests actually have over a hundred million.

The benefit of starting with broad interests is that they’ll give you much cheaper impressions and allow you to scale anything that’s profitable without worry about burning out your audience.

For each adset, we also set a minimum spend of $10 for each adset using our rule of distributing half the CBO budget evenly amongst the adsets.

Then we tested 2 different ads for each adset, but we actually recommend you to test 3 ads when you’re trying this. Since running this store, we’ve noticed that three has been performing equally as well while allowing you to test more creatives with the same budget.

If a campaign wasn’t profitable as a whole we’d normally kill it after 2 days.

When you’re analyzing your campaign after two days, you’re looking for any adsets that are profitable.

If your adsets haven’t even spent your target cost per purchase yet though, you should be looking for metrics like cost per add to cart that indicate it will be profitable later down the line. As far as your different video ads go, you want to look for the video ad with the best performance on Average Video Watch Time and Cost Per Link Click.

If you run this campaign for two days and find that none of your adsets are even close to being profitable, then I would scrap all of your creatives and start again from there. If all of your adsets are performing equally bad, it’s a good indicator that your creative is just not good enough.

If you test new creatives and they do bad again, it could be your product as well. The last hope in this case, would be to skip to phase 3 once you have enough data, but you could also save your money and start over again on a new product.

Anyways, once you have an adset and ad that you think are working, move onto phase 2. Don’t forget to kill your Phase 1 campaign if it’s not profitable as a whole.

**PHASE 2 - TESTING PROCESS ROUND 2**

In phase 2, we took the best performing interests and creatives to make another $200 CBO.

Since we had two winning interests, we duplicated each one five times to get a total of 10 adsets. We continued to set a minimum spend of $10 according to the rule from earlier.

Depending on the number of adsets you’re taking from Phase 1, you should duplicate each of them enough times to have roughly the same total number of adsets as Phase 1.

For example, if you found three winning adsets in Phase 1, you should duplicate them 3 times each for a total of 9 adsets in phase 2. It’s not exactly 10, but the goal here is to just get close.

You should also duplicate your winning video creative 3 times for each adset.

The idea behind this has to do with Facebook Artificial Intelligence and the differences in starting optimization for each adset, but that’s a topic for another video.

When we ran this campaign, our results were disappointing to say the least. In fact, it did worse than the original campaign, but that’s just how Facebook is sometimes. Luckily, the point of Phase 2 is just to gather enough data to move onto LookAlike Audiences in Phase 3.

Of course, it would be nice to make money at this point, but even if you don’t, you can just move right on to phase 3 as soon as there’s enough data. That’s exactly what we did here - just waited until we could move onto phase 3.

We recommend you wait until there’s at least XXX views, until you move onto phase 3. Having enough data is important for making a reliable look alike audience.

The general rule you want to follow in these first two phases is to collect as much data as you can while losing the least amount of money possible. Of course you can be profitable in these first two phases as well, but it’s also okay if you’re losing a bit of money.

Look Alikes will perform much better anyways so you don’t want to linger on these first two phases trying to make money through interest targeting.

**PHASE 3 - TESTING LOOKALIKES &amp; RETARGETING**

Phase 3 is when we start testing look alike audiences and also start a retargeting campaign.

The first lookalike audience to test is 75% video viewers. You want to make 10 audiences for each percentile inclusive from 0%. That would be 0-1%, 0-2%, 0-3% and so on. You also want to make sure you’re selecting worldwide when you’re making those lookalikes.

While you’re making those lookalikes, make custom audiences to use for your retargeting campaign.

Make audiences from the last 7 days for Page View, Top 25% time on site, FB engagement, 75% Video View, Add to Cart, and Initiate Checkout.

Setup a new CBO campaign with a daily budget of $50 to start, and use the custom audience to make 7 adsets - one for each custom audience.

As far as ads go for retargeting, you should make some new ads. We like to use photo ads like this that have a really strong call to action like sale ends today.

After two days, you should start adjusting the retarget budget as needed. If it’s super super profitable, you can try to squeeze more out of it by increasing the budget. If it’s not doing so hot, you should lower the budget.

Try to find a good ratio between your retargeting budget and the budget for your other campaigns. Use that ratio to scale your retargeting campaign as you scale up your other budgets.

Also keep in mind that cheaper products will need less retargeting, while more expensive products may benefit from heavier retargeting. If your product is really expensive, you might even want to expand the time frame included in your custom audience.

After setting up the retarget, we setup a campaign with 10 adsets. Each adset was targeting one of the 10 look alikes we created before, and they all had 3 duplicates of our video. Unfortunately, the lookalike did not perform as well as we hoped.

Instead of giving up, we tested a few more videos until eventually we landed on our winner. If we weren’t so lazy, we would have tested more videos from the beginning instead of just hoping that the lookalikes would perform.

If you’re testing 75% Video Views and it doesn’t work well you can try testing other look alikes such as 95% Video View or Page View. You will need more data for these Look alikes though.

Eventually you should find a few good look alike audiences that are working well. At that point you’re ready for phase 4.

**PHASE 4 - SCALING LOOKALIKES**

In phase 4 we try to scale the look alikes that are working well. This is when your results should start becoming a little more consistent.

So soon as we noticed that our 1% Look alike for 75% video view was performing well, we made a new CBO campaign with a $200 budget and duped the adset 5 times.

After a 2 days it was working super well, so we started doubling the budget every two days until it eventually reached $1500.

When you get a campaign with this kind of budget, results really start to even out as your campaign optimizes.

If you find that you’re not able to scale a campaign without performance tanking, you should try duping the campaign a few times instead. You can even dupe a campaign like 10 times if it’s working really well, but it doesn’t respond well to scaling the original budget.

We stopped scaling this campaign at $1500 though and just let it run as we moved onto our favorite phase. You should also move on from this phase once you’ve spent $5000. You can leave your profitable campaigns on from this phase while you test out the last phase.

**PHASE 5 - ""ENDGAME"" SCALING**

In our fifth and final phase, we’re looking to scale sky high with broad targeting. This is what I like to call the “end game. “

Broad targeting is where you let Facebook decide basically everything besides the CBO’s budget and the ad’s creatives. As far as targeting goes, everything is left on auto pilot.

I don’t give Facebook any audience whatsoever - no custom audience, no look alike, and no interests besides excluding dropshipping.

For this type of campaign, I split it up into three adsets. 1 adset targeting the USA, 1 adset targeting Canada+UK+Australia+New Zealand, and 1 adset targeting worldwide with a few third world countries removed.

I set a budget of $500 and just let Facebook do it’s thing. At this point, the only thing you have to do is adjust the budget.

After two days, I’ll make one of two decisions. I’ll either double the budget because it’s profitable, or I’ll kill it and go back to phase 4 to collect some more data before trying again. If it’s kind of in the middle, i’ll just let it coast another day or two until the decision is clear.

The reason why broad targeting is superior to all other forms of scaling is because:

It requires hardly any work to maintain. You don’t have to constantly go out there find more working interests. The size is basically the entire world.

It’s super easy to scale because audience size is massive, meaning that you can literally scale as high as you want.

You don’t have to refresh creatives because the audience size is so big. Eventually we did hit about 50M reach on one creative and had to refresh it, but up until that point everything was pretty smooth.

It optimizes over time to become better and better without you having to do anything. Meaning that once it’s optimized at a certain budget you can just crank it up, let it optimize at the next budget, and then rinse and repeat the process until you hit a point where your cash flow just simply doesn’t allow it.

Luckily in the case of Mr-Posture, the broad target worked super well. I ended up scaling it to $10,000 a day and letting it coast. It ended up spending $150,000 before Facebook decided to start giving us problems.

While we were coasting in Phase 5 letting the money flow in, of course we ran into some Facebook trouble.

This was during a period when Facebook was randomly flagging accounts like crazy. This is still happening to some extent, but during the summer when we were running this, it was like an everyday thing. Even before we got disabled for good, we were getting disabled like every day and having to submit appeals.

When we got disabled for the last time, we got around it with a new ad account under a new business manager.

If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, you should simply make a new business manager and ad account. Most of the time, you’ll be able to use your original page and website without issue.

Using our new ad account, we started right away with broad targeting using the original pixel. Since Facebook let’s you share pixels across business managers, it’s really easy to use your old data.

We just set the budget on day 1 and let it run until this ad account was disabled too. It was probably the easiest money we’ve ever made considering we just let it run on autopilot from the start.

Again these were our numbers:

$528,000 in sales after accounting for returns

$300,000 in ad spend between the two ad accounts

$79,0000 in COGS

This left us with roughly $149,000 in profit or 28% profit margins. Not bad for two months on one product.

If we were going to do this again though, we probably could have done better. This is what we would have done differently.

After seeing the broad campaign do so well, we should have asked Facebook to increase our spend limit on the new account

We could have made another ad account after the second one was disabled

We could have incorporated some other products into the store that are related to posture correction

We also tested a bunch of random ad strategies like manual bidding that ended up lowering our profit in the end

Overall though, we were happy with the final performance of the store. I learned a ton about how saturation works in drop shipping, and it gave me the confidence to pursue other products with even more competitors and a longer history of being sold.

If you are aware that the 21st century is advanced and even the phones are considered to be smart these days. So why not we humans?  

Are you people aware that there exists Artificial Intelligence to predict your customers' buying behavior on the basis of AI which gives AI predictions where you get to know at what ***time*** customers are visiting your store, on which ***day*** there is more traffic, at what ***price*** customers are preferring the product most, it predicts who will be purchasing again on your store and helps one time shopper to convert into loyal customers.

 These predictions help you to know your customers better and help in running a campaign when your customers are more active. This can help you getting expected effective results.  Isn't it wonderful? If you get such deep predictions you can easily run the Ads and all the money you spend in Ads will not be wasted and used wisely. Besides this, you need to ensure that you have proper engagement tools so that the traffic you generate from Ads doesn't bounce back.

My business partner and I are creating a premium fashion brand which will focus on high-end, ready-to-wear streetwear with a twist. We are planning on selling our products mainly online. We have invested and are planning on further invest  considerable amounts of capital into various aspects of the business. We will have custom designs, patterns and premium materials. We will engage in creative guerrilla marketing campaigns in order to get our name out there.

The branding is on point as well, our logo, typeface/font and everything else was created with maximum attention to detail and care.  


**Here is the potential problem that I am seeing:**   


My business partner believes that using Shopify to create our online store and website will be sufficient for our goals.  


I disagree because I see so many low quality websites and stores that use Shopify, even the ""best-looking"" Shopify stores look cookie-cutter and similar to the cheap ones. The general difference being that the best-looking stores use higher quality images and more concise copy.  


Overall, I think that we won't be able to achieve the vision and creativity that we want our brand to have by using Shopify.

Older people like my mom and my aunties still use FB and don't have IG.

I think it was a scam. So this is what happened. 

Got the order from Google Shop. 

Order placed no problems... 
We shipped the order.... Advised the customer of shipment and tracking details. 
A couple of days later we get notified from Shopify of a chargeback! also a $20.00 fee for this chargeback. It had some kind of automated response with details you can fill out so they can respond back. What is weird though is they will send the response on the 11th of November... 
However Shopify already removed the funds from my bank. So I guess the response they had given me seems to be pretty pointless the money is already gone. 
What sucks is the order was still in transit, money had already been taken out. 
We tried to get into contact with the customer but got no reply. Also the customer never reached out to us at all. 
The reason for the chargeback is the client said we did not process a refund, however we never heard from the customer at all! 
Today the customer signed for the package :(

What is weird is the address it was sent to, you cannot view it on google. The person was not home and they picked it up from a walmart. We have obtained the signature and it is the name of the person... 

So now, we are out of pocket on a big order and the person gets a free item!

By Default your shopify checkout will provide an option to allow cellphone number only in order processing. You should CHANGE this to make email mandatory. 

I learned this the hard way. When I thought I would try reach out to the customer I realized they only ordered with a number and no email. I had no way to try and email the customer and find out what was happening. I am not based in the US so the number was useless to me.

dropship,First store: Go big or dip a toe in?,"Hello folks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to dip my toes in the Dropshipping world. I've done some FBA in the past. I'm actually a professional photo/video dude with about 3 years of online marketing experience, so I can make a product look good but I have several other things I'm wondering. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do I find the right product. I know about Oberlo. I know about Facebook ads, but how do I know I've got a decent supplier and product with good margins but not too much competition?
2. Do people really not care about the insane 2-3 week shipping times? How can you be sure the product coming from China will be shipped ok? Can a first time seller like me work out a deal to send a piece of white labeling with shipments from China? Can I at least change the shipping label? 
3. I have an idea for a niche store that would have lots of products across several categories but appeal towards a certain subset of buyers? Is that too much for a first time dropshipper? Should I try to do a single product site instead? If I do a single product site with Shopify, can I easily change the site to a different product (or products) with just a new domain or do I have to register an entire new Shopify account?
4. If I'm starting a store with multiple products, do I need to buy all of the products for myself first to test? How trustworthy are Aliexpress reviews? How do you build relationships with suppliers? Can I work with US based suppliers exclusively?

I know that's a lot of questions. Serious thank you to anybody who can help.

As for cost, I've spent around $20 getting likes on the Facebook (got around \~300 likes) to generate ""trust"". I have the Facebook like script prominently on the top of my navigation to display the count. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent another $30 on experimental Facebook product ads. In a few days, this brought in around 300-400 visitors. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made a few mistakes along the way. Forgot to edit the ""cart"" page for my theme until today, so it was displaying empty placeholder images (whoops). 

&amp;#x200B;

I made an Instagram business page, liked around 8 images, then got ""blocked"" from doing anything else.... Wish I could use Instagram, but the bots have deemed me a bot currently. Hoping this gets fixed soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Finding a good niche product is pretty important. I've worked with so many clients that want to drop-ship, and pick really terrible product categories. It doesn't matter how good your site looks if no one wants to buy your items :/

* google trends tendencies
* potential margins (dropshipping price - AliExpress price incl. shippin)
* AliExpress revenue (i.e. average daily sales x price)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to test some new products and I don't know which direction I should take. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck between 2 options.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I create a general store, with a generic name, and test many products and see what sells (then when I find my winning product, focus exclusively on that product and it's branding in order to scale up)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Create a single product store and focus heavily on branding from the start. I'll do everything I can to ensure that I make sales from that product.

As a respectably sized company on social (about 250k on FB &amp; 135k on IG) we get hit up frequently asking if we work with influencers.

One trend we've witnessed is the impact of influencers. At this point in the game, everyone knows most are compensated and therefore they don't get near the sales people would think.

This will not stop us from using influencers, which leads to my question.

dropship,Update about my fashion apparel store,"https://vitalityfashion.com

Hey, thanks all for the feedback. At most, these were the following issues:

1. All items being on sale is not good: I changed that, made only one collection of items on sale

2. Sorting function in collection pages: done

3. Increase delay popup time: now set to 40sec

4. Size chart contains unnecessary sections like kids and lingerie in dresses section for example: fixed, only relevant size chart will appear under products. I have also recreated it to match the theme

5. Check if supplier has rights to model images: checked. I have email trail saying they have rights to them and I have rights to use them 

6. More reviews: waiting on more sales 

7. Product descriptions: this is the only thing left. It's gonna take me a while and I haven't had time to get started yet. 

One more question: do you guys think I should add colour swatches? Or list different product colours as separate products? With color swatches on my theme, user can't hover over one to see the preview, it'll take him to the product page instead (which I don't like), it's a limitation of the theme. What do you guys prefer? 


Additionally, I used some app to get free 1:1 traffic. So you might see some ads coming up at the bottom of the page. Is this a big negative? Or is it fine? 


Let me know what you guys think. And I appreciate all the feedback. It would be great if y'all could help spread the word about my site, I'm still struggling with sales unfortunately :)

I’m a collage artist. I make my money right now from doing commissions and freelancing for other people who want me to make them a collage. 

I have access to RedBubble which is basically ON demand manufacturing for artists. They will slap your work on literally anything (phone cases, prints, shirts, hoodies, frames artwork, clocks, bed duvets,etc.) 

I have my own website, I post their whole selection on my website and when a customer orders I just go back to RedBubble and they manufacture &amp; ship for me. 

I collect a handsome markup as the middleman and original owner of the artwork. 

The problem is I have TOO many options. 

First of all, I have over 15 artworks. 

Secondly, there is about 6 different categories and about 2 products per category. 

Each product can be differentiated by size   Or type (phone cases for example) 
While some are one size (a framed art piece).

dropship,Word of advice for any beginner,"You are starting a business, treat it like one. Work hard, do some solid research before you start, understand it won't be as easy as the gurus told you and that you will likely fail for a bit before you succeed. If you have heard stories of people succeeding after just starting up, great for them (if even true). It will likely not happen to you. If you have never marketed a product, ran ads on a social platform, built a website before, built a brand etc, then do not expect any type of results after throwing up a site and spending $50 in adspend. It's a process, learn as you go along. Understand no one is going to spoon feed you everything you need to know to succeed, not even the gurus you pay to do exactly that. This post is not to demotivate, but to hopefully get you in the right mindset. If you can't work hard, take some initiative, and deal with some risk/loss, then you just might not be cut out for this type, or any type of business.

dropship,"Before You choose Product(s), Please Read This","I've been meaning to put this together for awhile but haven't found the time until today. I'd just like to quickly give the ***3 most import questions*** (imo) that you should ask yourself when you think you've found a product that might sell. This comes from the experience of failing with 5 stores before finding success, so I hope you will not see this as just another echo-chamber post. These questions are in order of importance and significance, with number 1 being absolutely essential. So:

1. **Is my product unique? Is it uncommon?**

I've seen it time and again, dropshippers will pick product(s) that they think look nice, or is cool or neat, or fits into one of their passions, without taking into account that the walmart down the road already sells the same product or similar to it. My first store was a clothing store. It failed. Of the many reasons why, one was that the clothes I was selling really weren't unique. Sure, I couldn't find the specific shirts in a walmart or anywhere else, but I could find similar designs everywhere, *which meant it was common*. When you choose your product, *you must be able to answer this question as ""Yes, my product is unique, and no it is not common.* This is the most important aspect of a winning product.

2. **Is my product useful/does it fulfill a want or need?**

If your product is unique/uncommon, but really doesn't do anything for the user, then you are dependent on the uniqueness of the product for sales. **This can only be overcome by superior branding**. One of my stores sold this bracelet that doubled as a phone charger. It was a very nice looking bracelet, and You would think ""it's definitely unique, and everyone needs to charge their phones"", but the problem was that the wire alone does not charge the phone. You need a wall adapter or external battery to plug the wire into. Because of this caveat, people instantly saw the flaw. And because I didn't brand it as much more than ""bracelet charger"", people were uninterested.

Later on, I saw a company selling the same product, EXCEPT they branded it as a luxury item, put together excellent content with custom photos portraying it as luxurious (putting it next to expensive watches, taking pictures of ""rich"" people wearing it), and also allowed for the user to have their initials engraved on it. Because of that branding/extra work they did, it sold. *It still had the same use as it did when I was selling it, but people now wanted it because everyone wants to feel fancy, and this fulfilled their want.*

3.  **Does my product have an audience?**

You can have a unique, useful product, and no audience for it. Or, an audience that is hard to get to. At one point, I tried to sell these special incense burners. They were very neat, unique, and did their job of burning incense. They passed the first two questions. The problem was that the audience that buys that sort of thing is less likely to buy on instagram/facebook. It was definitely not impossible to get them to buy, but with my inexperience at the time with advertising and marketing, I couldn't reach them properly. When you think you've found your product, give some thought to what the audience for this product would look like. Are they targetable? Remember an important rule for the dropshipping method of online selling: **If your audience is everyone, you will reach no one**. There are of course exceptions, and if you are experienced in marketing this rule doesn't really apply to you, but for the average joe, you need to find specific audiences with specific interests. Females under 27 is not a good audience. Males who like clothing is not a specific interest.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that this can help someone just starting out. A ""winning"" product may be a lot more important than you think. Unless you are experienced, the saying ""you can sell anything"" does not apply to you. Remember that you are not special, and believing in yourself does not equate to experience. I say this only because I fell into the mistake of thinking these exact things, and was met with the unfortunate reality that I wasn't special, and experience must be acquired. Best of luck.

dropship,Building a store is hard,"Hi there, I'm writing my own experience into dropshipping. I've been reading the sub and came across many stupid questions. Thought I might give some insight into my own business, although it's still not running but being built atm.

I've found a very good domain and a niche that is very profitable nowadays. Proceeded to buy hosting, installing WP and WooCommerce, configuring SSL and finding a good theme (which is meh, need to look further).

This is where things stand. WP is not easy to master. It requires add-ons and extensions, good control of categories and product pages. Also a good frontpage is hard to achieve. A lot of trial and error.

I read here a lot of ""I have $10 and want to make $1000 by the end of the month"". Fucking load of horseshit.

I intend to run my own FB and IG pages and post in dedicated forums. It's not in my plans to go right out and post ads. Only later if I see fit.

Spent 17€ so far and have a budget of 500€. Surely when my store is all set up and running I'll find some marketing strategy. I'm a video editor so I intend to make videos, making YouTube channel too and maybe advertise with other YouTubers.

I'm not buying any plugins or extensions. My supplier is AliExpress exclusively.

Anyway, I'm walking the walk and it's not easy and sometimes I feel like quitting.

dropship,I created an order tracking solution that hides the fact that you are dropshipping and prevents disputes,"For a long time I am a still reader of this sub, I started dropshipping about a year ago and it always bothered me that people saw that the products come from China and not the country I am from. To solve this issue I created my own tracking solution that uses the API feeds of the shipping carriers but filters out the location names.

This way the buyers still get accurate information about the delivery status but you don't give off this shady image that you are shipping from China. It reduced my disputes and messages from concerned buyers by 70-80%, and it makes your shop look like a professional business.

My tool also displays related products on the order tracking page to upsell customers when they visit it to check their delivery status. Since many people are impatient and check the tracking pages very often, you get a lot of free traffic you can use to try to convert them again. Of course you can also implement your Facbook pixel or any other retargeting pixel on the page. And the best thing is, you can select your custom branding and style for the tracking page to make it a part of your shop.

Since I am valuing this sub a lot, and I know this is a shameless plug, **I am giving you ALL a full month for free to check it out.** Use the coupon code `r/dropship` during sign up to get the free month: [https://showparcels.com](https://showparcels.com)

ecommerce,Questions: What do your sales funnels look like? What metrics do you track? And what does success look like for you?,"\[edit\]: added the ""my assumptions"" piece after posting originally.

**A couple questions for the group:**

1. For those of you who try to drive cold traffic directly to a relatively low-cost sale, what does your sales funnel look like? ex:
   1. FB/IG ad -&gt; Landing Page -&gt; Product Page ?
   2. FB/IG ad -&gt; Product Page ?
   3. FB/IG ad -&gt; Email... later follow up through Email?
   4. Something else?
2. What metrics do you aim for?  And what does success look like for you?  Right now, my numbers are:
   1. \~ $0.25 per click on an FB/IG ad
   2. 20% click through from Landing page to Product Page (ie. 80% bounce rate)
   3. \~1.0 - 1.5% conversion to sales (ie. $25 in advertising dollars per sale)

To be profitable, I will definitely need to bring that $25 ad spend per sale down.

*My Assumptions are:*

1. I'm wrong about there being enough demand for how I'm positioning myself in my market
2. My copy isn't good enough yet.
3. My sales funnel/process just doesn't work for what I'm aiming for

Just interested to hear from some people who have had success on if they think my high bounce/low conversion is because of assumption #2 or #3.

**Background:**

I'm new to ecommerce.  still learning the ropes.

So far, I've done the following:

* Spent a good amount of time researching a target market
* Looked at other companies in my space and their Alexa rankings, traffic, etc.
* Found similar, high-selling products on drop-shipping platforms
* Looked for ways to differentiate my offer that I think the market will respond to

In short, I know there's a target market.  And I believe I can differentiate myself enough to sell to some of it.

Now, I'm just doing low-dollar ad testing &amp; drop-shipping before I go all-in on anything.

Right now, I'm aiming for two things:

* To keep my setup VERY simple.  My current setup is:
   * FB/IG ads -&gt;
   * Landing page (Nice Hero Image &amp; Headline, information + CTA to click through to Shopify product page) -&gt;
   * Shopify product page (buy now, add to cart, etc.)
* To go after high-volume, low-cost sales

Again, just interested to hear from some people who have had success on if they think I should focus on changing the structure of how I drive my traffic or if I just need to work on better copy &amp; content to increase conversions.",8,15,2019-10-28,ECOM,0.028595533221960068,0.9355823397636414,0.03582209721207619
dropship,Read this if you're experiencing FB ad inconsistency,"I've been dropshipping for a year now and one thing that has been really pissing me off over the last year has been the inconsistency that comes with running Facebook ads. 

Inconsistency has been holding me back a lot and I think there are 2 reasons why:

1. You're not testing enough creatives (Yes, I know you probably hear this a lot). I disregarded this one for a while because I assumed that my creatives couldn't be the issue with small budgets. But, you've got to think of it like this: Facebook spends money differently each day depending on your ad performance inside your ad sets. For example, if you have 3 creatives, one could be doing well one day and underperform the next day. By having 3 creatives, it 'balances out' this process because Facebook will spend differently depending on how your ads are performing.
2. SPEND MORE: I can't stress this enough - You'll see more consistency if you simply spend more. When you're spending $50-100/day on advertising a product on Facebook, you're bound to see fluctuations because that's just how Facebook works. So, if you're spending more, just like the ads inside your ad sets as mentioned above, your results will 'balance out' resulting in more consistency. For instance if you're spending $500/day across 3 campaigns, one could perform badly, one could do okay and one could do amazingly well one day, resulting in an overall ROAS which is good day after day.

I hope this makes sense but if it doesn't feel free to drop a comment. I'm not 100% certain this is how everything works but this is just from experience and I'm hoping this will help just a few people out with their dropshipping journey.",3,12,2019-10-28,ECOM,0.03629438579082489,0.9259466528892517,0.037759024649858475

ecommerce,Off the shelf platform or web framework for B2B web shop?,"**TLDR: Should a B2B company with about 7k products and integrations with external ERP and customer service app use Magento, bigCommerce or similar, or develop a tailored made site using a external web dev agency with a web framework?**

We're working on a new ecommerce website for our B2B business. Today we're running on a custom made .NET platform, developed by a local web dev company. The website is linked to our ERP, so when I client makes a purchase on our webshop, it sends a message to our ERP system about the order. Also the product stock levels are gathered from our ERP. We're handling about 7000 products on our web shop today.

We're having some trouble with the current solution. One is development, which for some reason is very expensive from our web devs, if we want a new type of template or functionality. We also find it very unstable and have a lot of down time.

We would also like to give the clients more **user tailored information** when they're logged in. Like showing them current support tickets with us(from our CRM), previous sales **including manual sales via phone/email,** which means asking our ERP for all orders, and products based on what they've been looking for or bought earlier. 

We are also looking into moving from B2B only, to sell B2B and B2C. Not sure if we'll do that from the same platform, but definitely from the same ERP. 

**My questions is: What would the best setup be in terms of platform and technical setup?** I feel that there are all these cons choosing a custom tailored web shop, developed by an external agency using Laravel, .NET, or any other framework. Like having to develop every single functionality from scratch. On the other hand, something like Magento or bigCommerce would probably mean a lot of customisation to get what we really want, and get all the integrations working, which might be a pain in the ass to maintain.",23,6,2019-10-28,ECOM,0.030395720154047012,0.9342843294143677,0.03531993180513382

Just want to hear from some experienced professional who use either shopify or inktake on which one they found easier to use and more cost friendly and less of a hassle to maintain.,3,7,2019-10-30,ECOM,0.015440504997968674,0.885611355304718,0.09894821047782898
woocommerce,Woocommerce to Facebook Shop Integration,"What is the best WP plugin for auto syncing woocommerce products to a facebook shop/store page?

I have checked out StoreYa and it is extremely vague about how customizable the shop page on facebook is.

[https://imgur.com/a/lXWkCIQ](https://imgur.com/a/lXWkCIQ)

Is this shop page layout editable??

I have also looked into Social Commerce by premiumthemes and their (as far as i can tell, aside from changing the colours) uneditable layout is ugly.

Surely there are more plugins to this? Is there not one that just adds the products into the basic facebook shop style?

dropship,Allow eCommerce Customers to Provide Feedback &amp; Reviews- Let your satisfied customers speak for you.,"# Nothing is more awful than talking without being listened to.

This is how customers feel if they are not provided with a platform for airing their feedback and reviews about your products and services.

**80% of the buyers choose products based on the reviews of the other buyers! Add a product review section with some alpha and beta reviews for it to become easy for the buyers to choose your product!**

With reviews &amp; feedbacks, it will be easier for you to engage with clients, thus giving you insight into what they feel about your company.

Seeking feedback from your customers is quite easy since you only need to avail to them a comments section on your website. Likewise, you can allow them to rate your services or products. While at it, you should keep in mind the fact that enabling customers to provide feedback is only one side of the coin.

In this regard, you should make them feel that you’re listening. This can be done by replying to their comments and queries as well as addressing whatever complains that they have. If you engage customers in this manner, they are likely to trust you. Therefore, retaining them will be easy.

Product reviews are more convincing when they’re plentiful. To encourage more feedback, don’t be shy about asking your customers to leave a review after making a purchase. Customers who are satisfied with your product often won’t consider leaving a review because everything is already fine. Give them a gentle push, and they’ll likely be glad to share their positive experiences with others.

You can incentivize them with loyalty points for leaving a review. Also, by offering buyers a small discount after they make a purchase if they leave feedback. You can give Loyalty Points for dropping a review. This will encourage them to come back for the redemption of those points.

Thus, reviews and feedback if positive can be used as an amplifier to boost your sales and will help in building goodwill of your store.

shopify,Thinking of building a tax management solution for Shopify merchants - feedback greatly appreciated!,"Hey Guys [👋](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand-sign/),

I'm a small-scale Shopify seller (&lt;$10K revenue annually) and have been in the game on-and-off for around 2 years. As a ""solopreneur"", I've been using my personal card for all business purchases - causing quite a bit of tax confusion during filing season.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been messing around with analyzing my transactions and found a few interesting things that could have been written off. These include:

1. Food costs for meeting with a partner for designs; these could have been expensed (and the gas costs there too)!
2. Part of my rent costs subsidized for ""business purposes"" - go figure.
3. Some ""office supplies"" like pens and paper
4. Market research software
5. Your CELL PHONE PLAN
6. You can even claim depreciation on your capital assets (lamps, tables, etc.)

Et cetera. I've already found around $2K in tax write-offs, and was pretty cheesed that I didn't know about this before.

So that's the tax write-offs part; definitely a lot left to be desired in terms of the clarity of what can/can't be written-off (but could also be my own ignorance) - although Shopify does do a great job finding your sales tax.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I've found that when I've been looking for a good points card, the best thing that I keep coming across is the American Express Business Gold Rewards Card. AmEx usually does a great job with their card, but there are a few things that I think could be improved for us merchants:

1. AmEx isn't accepted everywhere. I can pay for my FB and Instagram ads and get those **sweet, sweet points**, but I can't pay for my coffee in the morning ==&gt; I want a credit card that I can use everywhere
2. AmEx points are only **really good** when you're redeeming them on gift cards, or air travel. I believe the economics work out to be around 0.6 cents per point when redeeming it on my day-to-day purchases ==&gt; This equates to only around 0.6% cashback, with a supplementary card fee of $50 and an annual fee of $250.
3. Since I run the store by myself, I really don't want to get a separate business card. I'm not afraid of having multiple cards (even though I only use one), but having one **unified card** to separate my business and personal expenses would be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do these two ramblings have *anything* to do with each other?

They don't, really. However, I think I've found a solution that could solve *my problems*. Here's what I've validated can be done so far:

* Offer an ***e-commerce focussed*** ***credit card***. 
   * It dynamically picks your top 2 spending categories (like Amex) and gives you points similar to AmEx. However, these points can be redeemed for up to 1% cashback on key e-commerce categories (Ads, Shipping, etc.)
   * The unit economics work out such that this card can be offered *for free*.
* Have a ***personal accountant*** ***in your pocket***.
   * After every gray-area purchase (i.e. buying lunch), you'll get a text in real-time to figure out whether or not this is a business or personal expense (i.e. Was this with a client/for business purposes? If yes ==&gt; write-off). This helps discover tax write-offs you might not have thought about.
   * Since keeping receipts are pretty important (I'm a culprit of not keeping my receipts too), you'll get prompted to take a picture of your receipt, and we'll store it in case you get audited.
   * Since everything's been categorized at the point of purchase, quarterly and annual income tax filings are automatically provided as well

&amp;#x200B;

I'll end the pitch here. What I'm more curious about is how many other people have this problem, and if it's significant enough to switch to a card that provides these benefits. I have a lot of experience in the FinTech industry building similar products and can round up the financial and technical resources to make this happen - that is of course, if you guys would find this useful as well.

&amp;#x200B;

All feedback is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance.

shopify,Looking for advice for worldwide duties and taxes,"Hey all, 

So I've got a store running with a number of sales being made world wide. I'm starting to get hit pretty hard by VAT/duties in some countries so I'm not sure if I'm doing this wrong in terms of my declaration of goods. So my shopify site is fulfilled by a Hong Kong based fulfillment center that ships worldwide. Here are some numbers in USD.

Item cost in shopify: $48 (Discounted from $58)  
Shipping: $8 (Once I implement more shipping rules that this will vary, but so far I've charged a flat fee)  
Total charge to customer: $56

Now I'm sending these world wide so I'm getting charged about:-  
\- $8 to UK  
\- $9 to Germany  
\- $12 to Norway  
\- $10 to France

I didn't mind losing a couple of dollars from shipping, but my customers are now being asked to pay for VAT/duties upon receiving it and have said it's really high. A UK customer was charged 15 GBP ($19 USD), 280 NOK ($30.57 USD), etc. and want to refund

I'm still having a profit but this is making it really not worth it.

So question time, is my fulfillment center declaring the items wrongly? Should I be declaring the value of the item at my own cost price + shipping (so lower than what I'm selling for). Or should it be declared at the $48 that the customer bought, or $56 that they paid including shipping?, or $58 which is the actual retail price before discount?)",4,3,2019-10-31,ECOM,0.2085839807987213,0.7495742440223694,0.04184185713529587
