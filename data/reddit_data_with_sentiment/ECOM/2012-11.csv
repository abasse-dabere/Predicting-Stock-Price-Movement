I am currently looking at various review providers (Bazaarvoice, a number of smaller providers) for a website I am working on. During a discussion with a person at one of the smaller companies,  I brought up the topic of a launch campaign for the product review platform - specifically sending out an email to every customer in the last 3 months incentivising them to leave a review with a voucher for the site or other such gift. I was then told that there had been some recent legislation passed stating that this was against marketer ethics/guidelines. I have been looking online for evidence but can't find any.

Can anyone shed some light on whether this is true, or if this guy was speaking out of his ass?

Also, should mention I'm in the UK.

ecommerce,One product store template,"Hi, I am looking for a one product store html/css template but it seems impossible. Looking at sites such as themeforest all landing page templates seems to be geared towards iphone apps or saas services. 

What I want is a good (but not too ""designy"") looking page with  picture of the product, some bullets, a small box of text, the price and a big order now button. Also some general text around for ""about us"" info and stuff like that.

ecommerce,Taking over website. Need help,"My father started his own company about 20 years ago selling tools and shop supplies. He wants me to take over and I've been going to school for computer networking so I don't want to continue the door to door sales. We have a website through godaddy quick shopping cart and its... terrible. It doesn't have SSL, not that customizable and it costs 450 a year and so far produced 2 sales less than 100 each. Not to mention that photos are missing and product details are little to non existent.

So far what I've done is bought a new domain, setup webmaster tools and analytics.

What I need for our website is:

Mailing list and signup. We print and mail new catalogs throughout the year. I want to have the catalog online in pdf so they can choose to get an email with a link to it when we update it and or to have a hard copy sent to them.

Drop shipping. We stock a lot of products but our warehouse and budget is small so we cant stock everything


ease of use in back end. I'm good with technology but my dad is not. He will still be using it to check for orders and prices changes and what not.


Inventory management and syncing with our warehouse. We have no inventory management, he does it all in his head. Also all the sales we do are done via order blanks and put into the computer by hand which can take a lot of time. We have Peachtree but its only used for sales and customers. I want to integrate a inventory management system.


email and automation. with Godaddy QSC there is no email. so hes been using our local isp's email service for the business. Also since as of now we rarely get orders I'd like email alerts for orders so we see them right away.


Money is tight, he's still the boss and in his eyes the website has just been a waste of money. We've used shopify in the past and and some problems, but mainly over expensives. We have low prices to be competitve but with paypal, credit card processes, and even the website host taking a cut of the sales it leaves little profit for us. So we need a cheap solution until we can grow our online presence and sales, we dont want to throw our money away.


So, any suggestions on where to start? We've got a lot of products and with 99% of them needed photo and details updated it looks like a huge monster to tackle

ecommerce,Perhaps silly SEO/keyword/niche question....,"Hello Community.

I have been doing SEO small time for my small company for 2-3 years now.  I also do the social media as well.  Nothing too big, but I would not consider myself a complete noob.

However, now I will be helping my GF with her new eCommerce site which is quite a niche market.

SO I have this silly question:

**When I do keyword analysis its hard for me to determine how niche is niche....or in other words....what is a lot...what is a little...**

**For example:**

If I use ""Purple monkey Dishwasher""

and there are 100,000 global searches...it that a lot?

if there are 5000 local searches...for example Canada...what does that really mean in terms of a scale that I can relate to? 

--

 **I read someplace that for ecommerce you can basically calculate something like this:** 

100,000 searches = 1-3% if you are on the first page.

Then visitors to your site = 2000 (if I use 2%)

Then 1-2% buy something or do some action. Lets say buy a ""purple monkey dishwasher""

Therefore you could guess this site would sell about 40.  (using 2%)

---

Am I crazy?  I am just trying to get some kind of scale that I can wrap my brain around and therefore be able to determine if 

A) Something is niche

B) How good/bad

C) Profitable

No problem so far.

The part that's hanging me up is:

The products are physical goods that are purchased and shipped via subscription - but at variable frequencies. I need a platform that will allow a customer to choose their product &amp; variation attribute and then choose how often they would like it delivered/billed. I need all of this to happen while the backend is providing the usual abilities to let customers create and manage individual profiles, generate sales reports, and easily handle product database updates and modifications.

I'm looking for a WordPress plugin solution, but am open to other platforms if they're suitable. OpenCart and OSCom are not an option for me.

ecommerce,E-commerce biz owners: how long did it take you to start getting a good amount of traffic/orders?,"I started an e-commerce business in August and business is pretty slow. I'm wondering if it's the particular product I'm trying to sell and whether it's not really suitable for e-commerce, or if it just takes a while for an e-biz to get steady traffic and orders. My product is imported candy and snacks (British chocolate/etc).

I'm curious to know what everyone else's experience with starting their e-commerce business was like. Thanks for any input!",0,1,2012-11-29,ECOM,0.025322264060378075,0.9066368937492371,0.06804084032773972

ecommerce,Looking for a mid-level ecommerce provider for a website that functions like Overstock or Wayfair,"I'm pretty new at this, so any info about the right place to start looking would be helpful. I'm looking to create a website that can sell 20,000+ products. I'm looking for features like multiple categories, multiple color options on the same product, as well as being able to select accessories to add-to-cart along with the product on the product page. 

Wayfair and Overstock both have the type of functionality I'm going for, but i assume that they've spent a lot on their sites. I'm looking to spend $5,000 or less to start it up. (less is better). Features like quickview, or mouseover an image to view it are nice, but not strictly necessary. compatibility with multiple payment forms, and things like verisign are important as well. 

Essentially I'm looking for different ecommerce products that can mimic these types of sites, and wondering what of their features I can hope to get or expect to lose when spending less than 5000 dollars.
I'm open to some work-intensive templates or software, but as I'm brand new at this, nothing with too steep of a learning curve. I'll also be trying to find somewhere to host the site that can ideally eventually handle upwards of 1,000 users a day. 

Thanks for any help you can give me on either subject, or places you can point me to learn more about what might be able to give me what I need.",0,1,2012-11-30,ECOM,0.031009068712592125,0.9345855116844177,0.03440544754266739
