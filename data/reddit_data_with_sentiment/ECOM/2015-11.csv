ecommerce,[Prestashop] Question - Stopped receiving order confirmation emails?,"Hey guys,
I was wondering if you lovely guys could help at all? I help manage a Prestashop store, however a few weeks ago our order confirmation emails have just stopped working. 

It's not the email settings, as they all work still and I can send test emails - it seems to be purely the email alerts.

ecommerce,What's the best way to set up a Facebook account for an online business?,"Facebook's account creation is a little weird for businesses. It seems they want you to use your own personal account and then make a ""Page"" for your business. 

However if you go this route, your business's ""page"" is not able to friend people. I though that might be a detriment. I also didn't want to have my personal facebook account associated with my business online.

What I did was make a new Facebook account with my business's name entered where it asks you for your personal first/last name. Then I also used that account to make a ""Page"" for my business. However when people search for my business name on facebook, they now get 2 results.

How do you guys have it set up? How should I change my current set up to best communicate with and find/advertise to more customers in the future? I do plan to experiment with facebook ads at some point.

ecommerce,Have had great success in first 3 years but need new marketing ideas for my online store.,"My partners and I launched www.matboardandmore.com 3 years ago and we have done quite well reaching tens of thousands of customers and becoming one of, if not, the top custom matboard company in the USA.

Here is some important information about us:

* **Products** : Custom matboards and picture frame accessories.
* **Customers** : Range from consumers buying single mats to larger businesses buying thousands of mat for wholesale. Artists are our best customers though, they buy in the hundreds but there are way more of them.
* **Competition** : Fairly weak, it's an old school industry and we have been fortunate to take advantage. 

I am hesitant to give out too much information but I am reaching out to this awesome community to see if we can brainstorm some growth strategies, primarily through Digital Marketing.

Our marketing has been focused on the following areas, and these core strategies continue to do well but I we definitely need to augment them.

* **Awesome product.**  Our website is best in class, and our service and quality is top notch.  We continue to improve the site and ensure customers get products that are fantastic. This is always going to be the most important thing to help us market ourselves and it's been proven with a very loyal customer base.
* **SEM and SEO.** We have maxed out our budgets on AdWords and Bing through search marketing.  These campaigns have been refined over the years and perform very well. We use PLA's, Remarketing with great success.  SEO is continuously a challenge but according to SEM Rush we have the best performance of any of our direct competitors.  I know we can continue to improve with SEO but I'm not sure what else to do right now on that front.

That's been our formula to date.  Get people in through search (SEM and SEO), convert them and get them to be loyal customers for life.  Through that we have lowered marketing as a % of revenue by huge amounts each year and increased our profitability.  We also get a lot of word of mouth advertising which is free of course.

The areas which we have tried to grow but haven't had much success are:

* **Social** (FB and Twitter are super time consuming and don't convert, Pinterest helps us the most). I'd like to find the influencers in our industry but I have no clue who they are. Ads on these platforms haven't done well either.
* **B2B partnerships.** Limited success here. This is definitely my weak point personally as well. I think there is room for growth here, particularly with local frame shops but I haven't been able to make it work. 
* **Bloggers and influencers**, can't find any. There are a few forums we have connected with but again, very little luck.
* **International Sales**, I'd love to ship to Canada because there is nobody doing this there right now.  The challenge is shipping costs are really high and the customs/taxes are confusing. Anybody with experience here would be helpful.

I know it's a limited amount of information but I'm here to answer any questions and if someone out there is really amazing at this, willing to even pay if they can come up with ideas specific to our business.

Thank you all in advance.",8,2,2015-11-02,ECOM,0.021473083645105362,0.9263501167297363,0.05217684805393219

ecommerce,Guest post on our blog: Track These 4 Metrics &amp; Watch Your eCommere Business Grow,"Seriously, if you are not tracking these 4 metrics, then now is the time! Here are some of the major points:

Cost per Acquisition


To determine your cost per acquisition, take your total marketing spend for a specific channel over a period (year/month), and then divide it by the number of customers you acquired via that channel during that period.
For example, if you spend $100 on Twitter and acquire 10 customers from that channel, your CPA would be $10 per customer for your Twitter channel.
Whether you never heard of CPA before or haven’t spent the time to monitor it in the past, it’s never too late to begin. Here are a few questions you can ask yourself to identify opportunities to lower your CPA:

- What are my best performing products?

- Do the products on my homepage resonate with my target demo?

- Are my customers sharing a certain product on social media more than others?

- Do I have channels that aren’t performing?

- Are the people clicking on my ads being directed to relevant content?

Once you have an answer to these questions, be aggressive. By optimizing your content based on an analysis of your current CPA, you can lower your future CPA significantly. Place your best performing products on your homepage, and share them on your social media channels. Implement unique tracking URLs or offer unique discount codes to customers. Monitoring customer response to changes will give you incredible insight into what they actually want to see and buy. Your audience is your best advisor!

Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate


56% of shoppers leave a site without making a purchase because of unexpected costs.
An effective strategy in minimizing “sticker shock” is to offer free shipping. Not only should you offer it, you need to make it visually apparent – front and center – that you are giving your customers this break. Though it may not be a significant reduction in overall charges, simply making the customer aware that you are consuming some cost on their behalf plants the right psychological seed. When the customer sees their shipping charges zeroed out in the checkout process, they are more likely to follow through and complete the purchase knowing they are saving some cash.

Repeat Purchase Rate


From a business development perspective, learning about your customer is one of the best investments you can make in your ecommerce business. However, figuring out which of your existing customers are the most likely to purchase a second time is the more difficult. However, tracking your repeat purchase rate is crucial to lowering your costs. If I hadn’t learned what adventure packages drew most of my customers in (the ones at a certain price point, or the ones to specific countries), and what packages were purchased repeatedly, Offmap would have drained itself of cash after that first year just in marketing costs. 

Customer Lifetime Value


A customer’s lifetime value can be thought of as the dollar value of a customer relationship. You want to have a positive number for your CLV that is greater than your CPA, making your customer worth more than it cost to acquire them.

Determining your CLV is done by answering these three questions:

- What is my customer acquisition cost (CPA)?
- What is my annual profit per customer?
- What is my customer retention rate (CRR)?

Once you’ve figured out your CLV, it’s time to refine your data even further. Filtering these results by channel (such as AdWords, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) will provide you with insight into which channels are giving you the highest CLV. This will allow you to determine which channels to nurture further, and which to consider cutting back on. For example, if your Facebook Ads CLV is $500 but your Instagram CLV is $800, it would be wise to increase spend in your Instagram campaign.",2,12,2015-11-04,ECOM,0.05049305781722069,0.9166280627250671,0.032878849655389786

This all comes with a cost to pay the model and photographer. 

If I just have the 3 photos of the black pant and then give the customer the option of choosing the alternate colors without the photos, I am worried this would not convert a sale because the customer does not see a proper photo of that colored pant.

ecommerce,PCI compliance for eCommerce site only storing last 4 digits of credit cards,"Hi all,

We've got a client who needs to become PCI compliant. The Magento site will only be storing the usual details (name, address etc), and the last 4 digits of the credit card - no CVC.

In this case, can we simply secure the server our end (force TLS 1.2 only), and run a Qualys PCI scan - passing all the technical/infrastructure questions to our payment gateway plugin (Sagepay)?

There are questions such as: ""Is inbound and outbound traffic restricted to that which is necessary for the cardholder data environment?"" ""Are measures in place to prevent the disclosure of private IP addresses and routing information to the internet?""

Being able to off-load these to our payment provider would take off quite a burden.

For some context, the web server we're using is shared with some other clients. We do have firewalls etc in place, but with it being a web server there's no 'lock down' as such.

ecommerce,Started a site selling paddle board accessories. Anyone mind giving site feedback?,"I've launched a site to sell paddle board &amp; eventually kayak accessories. Not a lot of people get the full utility out of their paddle board, so I'm using my experience as a paddle board fishing hobbyist to find stuff that's actually useful and decent quality. I also find a lot of similar sites impersonal, so I'm taking the time to write unique product descriptions for each item vs. most places that just copy/paste a manufacturer description. I'm hoping this and great customer service is what will help me stand out. I feel like the domain name is strong, and I'm using Shopify to build it all out.

http://www.paddleaccessories.com/



I'm currently working on a few things, but wondering if anyone else has pointers from what I have currently to pick up some sales as I continue to grow the site.
I'm currently working on:

* A blog with tips on fishing, yoga, and exploration using a paddle board. Updated weekly.
* Full social media launch. Just building some content up first so I can be consistent.
* Videos for most products (I already have a couple, for example, [this item](http://www.paddleaccessories.com/collections/deck-accessories/products/paddle-buddy-fishing-rod-holder-suction-system) )
* Improved branding. I currently have an artist working on a more fun logo that adds some character to the brand (the ""paddle viking"" you see mentioned only in text right now).
* Reworking S&amp;H model. Trying to get this price down for the customer. May do a promotion for the holidays to drum-up business and help conversion.

woocommerce,"Help, please: Adding an extra step to check out","Hi woocommerce subreddit! 

This is my first time using woocommerce. I need to create a step where when customers go to checkout they are asked to enter an invitation code to continue to purchase (this is what my client wants). If the customer doesn't have a code, there needs to be a button that say ""request an invitation code"" and a code is sent to them.

What is the best a way to add the step to enter an invitation code when clicking on ""Check out""? 

What plugins would be the best to generate and send codes to customer? 

Your suggestions would be much appreciated!

ecommerce,"Dedicated Hosting, VPS? Which provider?? Please help.","Hi!

I am completely clueless when it comes to hosting solutions for my website. A little background first... I have a pretty new site, it's only been up a month or two and I have done zero advertising so far. I am getting ~1000-1500 unique visitors per month right now, but once I start advertising (which will be happening in the next week or two) I expect that to go up considerably. 

Currently The site is on a VPS hosted by GoDaddy. And it was loading slowly, so I spent a good amount of time &amp; money to optimize it. I was using gtmetrix as a reference &amp; we got load times down to of 1.5 - 2s. Sometimes though it would spike up to 10 or 20+ seconds &amp; I thought maybe this was due to a poor hosting service or incorrect / inadequate  configuration.

ecommerce,Stock video website help,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster here. I have an ecommerce website called [Maine Stock Video](http://mainestockvideo.com) where I offer stock video clips I've made for sale. I would say sell stock video clips but I've yet to make a sale...

Before I get into my questions, I want to provide a little background about this venture. I've been shooting and selling stock video clips for the last two years, mainly on Shutterstock.com, Pond5.com and iStockphoto.com. I also run a video production company full time and shoot stock video in my free time for extra income. Shutterstock and Pond5 bring me regular sales, while iStockphoto has an occasional sale. I earn between 15% to 50% commission for each sale, depending on which website a clip is sold on. iStockphoto has the lowest commission rates (15%) and they place my clips lower on user searches because I'm a ""non-exclusive"" contributor. This year they changed the way they rank and pay contributors, essentially increasing commission rates and search rankings for exclusive contributors, while lowering search rankings and commissions for non-exclusive contributors. At the same time they lowered prices across the entire site. Their explanation was this would drive mores sales overall because more people would be buying content. All of this works out pretty well if you're an exclusive contributor, because those guys are getting more sales (supposedly) and bigger commissions on those sales. However, for people like me it means about the same number of sales (or some months less) and about half of the commission of what I was getting before. All in all, these changes suck for me. 

I want to remove all of my stock video clips from iStockphoto but I don't want to just drop that source of income entirely. So I decided the best thing to do would be to host my clips on my own website and sell them directly to customers. And since I was going to be selling my clips, I thought it would also make sense to invite other people to sell their Maine-themed clips on my site too. This would provide an extra source of income because I could earn a commission on every clip they sell. Essentially, I want to be my own mini-iStock, in a niche market - Maine video clips. 

Now onto my questions:

1) My site is currently being hosted on GoDaddy, along with 5 other sites I run, all sharing the same hosting package. On top of that, the hosting is on GoDaddy's ""older servers"" because I've had an account with them for 6+ years. It's also a ""shared hosting"" account, which as I understand it means there could anywhere from 100-1000 other websites all being hosted on the same server. Obviously this is a problem. What kind of hosting or hosting company should I move the site to? 

2) I built the site on Wordpress using a theme I purchased online. The theme allows people to sign up as contributors, upload their videos and have me approve them before they get added to the site. The main reason I went with Wordpress is because I've been building sites with it for years, so I know how to use it and it doesn't require a monthly fee. The other reason is because the template I purchased was designed to do all of the things I want this site to do, such as selling digital content, allowing others to contribute, provides a shopping cart, etc. Plus the shopping cart is powered by the Easy Digital Downloads plugin which is free to use. Would you guys recommend I continue using Wordpress or this there a better option out there? Note I'd like to keep the monthly costs to a minimum. 

3) I ""soft launched"" the site a couple of months ago and have been running Google Analytics on it. Since the site is not done yet I've been waiting to tell people about it, so it's gotten zero traffic besides web crawlers. Once it's done and ready to officially launch, how should I go about getting traffic? I'm planning on doing SEO, contacting people in Maine that might have an interest in it directly (video production companies, office of tourism, etc) and telling people on social media. I've started a Twitter account and plan to start an Instagram account too. But I want to target web traffic - specifically people in other states that be doing a documentary or film or something where they would need a clip of Maine. How do I reach those people? Google Ads? Facebook Ads? Any suggestions would be appreciated!

ecommerce,"Considering starting an ecommerce site using WP. Would using these platforms work succesfully? (accounting, payment processing and invoicing)","Hi all,
Im planning on starting an online business and would like to get everything as far as payments and accounting in order before I move forward.
So what I would use is:
* Woocommerce (for managing orders, possibly using the freshbooks extension)
* Gravity Forms (to allow client to modify order, using stripe extension)
* Stripe (payment processing)
* Freshbooks (accounting)
* Avalara (Used for recording sales tax to specific states)

Ideally I would want everything automated like so:

Avalara specifies tax rate -&gt;client purchases item via gravity forms -&gt; Stripe processes payment -&gt; Freshbooks receives payment and creates invoice automatically emailing it to client -&gt; woocommerce manages order and shipping details.

ecommerce,Opinions wanted - selling single product line,"Hi all,

I'm bringing over a product to North America from Japan and I'm looking to setup a website to sell it.  I am likely going to use Shopify and get things moving along quickly.

The product will carry approx 10 different SKU's, but they are all similar and from the same Japanese company.  

My question is I'm not all that sure as to how I should go to market with this.  At first I thought I should just go ahead and use the name of the product for the domain, etc - but I don't want to upset my Japanese friends by doing this even though they will likely never come to America with their product.

So then I thought maybe I should just create my own branded site, etc - but that seems like a lot of work for a single product with 10 skus.

I have experience with building out ecomm sites and I will likely cross-promote with my other sites, but this is the first time I'm trying more of a ""micro"" site if you will.

Can anyone provide thoughts on this?  Am I over-thinking?

ecommerce,Chicken-and-Egg problem with Inventory Management Software,"I have some retail experience (cashier, customer service) and have been thinking about building an inventory management solution. The idea came essentially from looking at the grocery manager doing stuff on a computer with nothing but black screen and green text (I assumed he was doing something related to checking/altering inventory data). Well, modern tech has advanced quite a bit and black screen/green text seems way too outdated.

Long story short, I tried building an SaaS solution, but stumbled in the planning stages because I have no experience with inventory management. Decided to email a couple of local businesses asking what problems/pain-points they have with their current systems. Not a single response.

So, now I don't want to build something that doesn't address what's needed by these guys. And these guys don't reply to my email, so I can't think about how to go with this.

[WooCommerce Subscriptions](http://pluginforage.com/shop/woocommerce-extensions/woocommerce-subscriptions-extension/)
 allows you to introduce a variety of subscriptions for physical or virtual products and services. Create product of the month clubs, weekly service subscriptions, or even yearly software billing packages. Add sign-up fees, offer free trials, or even set expiration periods.

Features:
Variable subscriptions
Manage subscriptions
Free trials &amp; sign up fees
Manual or automatic renewals
Synchronized Payments (set payment dates regardless of when sign up)
Upgrades/Downgrades (have multiple subscription options e.g. silver, gold, platinum that customers can change to at any time)
Subscription coupons
Renewal emails

Prior to version 2.0, the customer needed to repeat the entire checkout process to subscribe to different products. No more!

Your customers can now purchase any number of different subscription products in the same transaction.

Better yet, Subscriptions intelligently groups products based on their billing schedule. This reduces payment gateway fees by processing the sign-up and renewal of multiple products in one transaction. It also streamlines fulfillment by creating a single renewal order instead of multiple orders for what might be a single shipment.",0,2,2015-11-21,ECOM,0.03256610408425331,0.9362713098526001,0.031162548810243607

ecommerce,"For anyone thinking about selling vaporizers, ejuice or other ""High Risk"" items. Research High Risk merchant accounts before starting your business","High Risk Merchant Processing - Sure You Want To Get Into That Niche?


I've been spending a lot of time on Reddit lately and have seen a lot of questions being asked about starting businesses selling ejuice, vaporizers and vape accessories, water pipes, coin, and many other products that are considered ""high risk"" to merchant processors.



Most people are probably not even aware there are certain products and industries basically locked out of banking and credit card processing. We've all heard how Medical Marijuana dispenseries have trouble finding banking relationships and credit card processors, however many people don't realize that many seemingly normal and legal products are banned by nearly all credit card processors.



These items could be anything from vaporizers or any vaping accessories, anything collectible, autographed memorbilia be it sports or celebrity stuff, coins, currency, drones, any non-tanginble items; ie programs and ebooks, many services,



Most credit card processors, as well as third party aggregators like Paypal, Stripe, and others, have a long list of specific items and businesses which they won't allow to use their service. All of them also add a caveat about how they have the right to refuse or terminate any relationship they believe may tarnish their repuation. This essentially means, if they happen to not specifically call out your product or industry or business, that they can fall back on that ""harm to them"" which basically means at anytime they can decide to kill your payment processing for whatever reason they deem necessary.

Is It Worth Entering A High Risk Industry?



I think most people think hey, I'll start a business, signup for a merchant account and things will be all good. For 99% of merchants this is true but many industries named above have an uphill battle finding credit card processors.



These businesses may occasionally find someone to take them on and they may have processing for a matter of days, weeks, or even months; but eventually that dreaded call or e-mail will come telling you that they are terminating their relationship with you and your business; and you'll be left scrambling to find a way to accept credit card payments.



The reason for this post is to bring this lesser known issue to people's attention. I've been spending a lot of time in the ""Ecommerce"" subreddit lately and see a lot of people dabbling with the idea of certain industries considered ""high risk"". I write this not necessarily to discourage people from entering these industries but at the very least, know what you are getting into.



I personally have run a business and sold items considered ""high risk"". My items were legal and not even really in any way ""shady"", had nothing to do with vaping, drugs or anything even questionable in nature; however I later learned my products had a high risk of credit card chargebacks and it's basically been impossible to accept credit card payments.



I was with Paypal for over 4 years. I did over 2 Million a year in sales on Paypal. I paid Paypal over $80,000 a year in processing fees and they still dropped me like a bad habit. Due to my stellar seller performance and relationship with my account manager they were kind enough to give me 30 days notice to find a new processor but not a whole lot of good that did as there really are no other options.



I wound up trying a few high risk credit card merchants. Got scammed out of a few thousand dollars, got a merchant account outside of the USA and thought all was good. What nobody tells you is that if you use a foreign merchant account 99.9% of your transactions will be declined by your customers bank for being ""suspicious transactions"". In order to get the transaction to go through nearly EVERY customer of yours will have to call their bank, explain the purchase, and ask the bank to okay that purchase. A huge headache when your trying to run an ecommerce business.



Another thing is 99% of high risk merchant processors are scams. I personally was scammed out of about $3,000 by a scumbag named Tony from Bankcard Services out of Chicago and New York. I personally know people who have lost tens and even hundreds of thousands of Dollars from scammers in the high risk merchant processing industry. I've heard it said for every legitimate high risk merchant processor there's 1200 frauds.



If you're considering entering an industry which you believe may be considered high risk, find a merchant provider, and search their website to see if the items you sell fall within the terms of service. It's also a good idea to call the merchant before opening the account. Don't just talk to a sales rep as they want the sale and will lie to you and tell you it's okay, only to have you be shut down weeks later, as all new accounts are typically audited within the first 30 days. Ask to talk to compliance or a supervisor and make sure they are okay with your business and the products you sell.



This extensive list below are just some of the products and business categories which are pretty much locked out of accepting credit cards...

ecommerce,30 days ago I asked for your help... I think I listened. Before/After comparison,"Hi guys!

Thanks again to everyone that offered their thoughts in my original thread: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/3osoab/please_help_me_sell_more_does_my_site_suck/

After all of your feedback, I tried fixing the site and realized the theme was too restrictive (a.k.a. I was too technically inept). I bought the Parallax theme and re-did the site with some higher quality pictures.

I was hoping to get your thoughts on the new layout!

The only things I can think off that it still needs are 1) social proof and 2) trust indicators. Trying to figure those out but I wanted to get the 80% solution up and running.

I got a free user test through http://peek.usertesting.com/ and the woman said she had trouble understanding what the benefits of the product are for. I don't understand because I explained the benefits of fish oil right in the first phrase: 

""WE MAKE QUALITY PET SUPPLEMENTS
Help support your dog's skin, coat, joint, and heart health with our Wild Omega-3 Fish Oil for Dogs.""

Anyway, let me know what you think and if you ran into the same problem or not!

We have received 2 of our main products and a variety of small accessories in stock ready to ship.  

We are expecting the rest of our clothing line to arrive mid-late December.  Our plan for launch tomorrow is to have our available products displayed with 20% for BF sale and a coming soon tab that features what products we have on the way and estimated time of arrival and price.

I have mixed feelings on how this could go but I think generally it should be positive to drive interest through the holidays. Hoping for some experienced ecommerce member feedback.

What site needs to be able to do:

Customer adds items to cart
Checks out but no payment taken
Store owner calculates shipping on order, updates order total and then sets the order to pending
woocommerce sends email with final invoice + paypal payment request link.

Possible?

So far I've found if the payment is set to cheque, the order comes in on-hold, which allows shipping and other fees to be added to the order. &lt; this is exactly how I want it to be, so far so good. The only issue is tying that into Paypal so that when the order is set to pending, it sends the payment link in the email.

So, another possibility is, is there a way to change a payment method on an on-hold order?

ecommerce,"Black Friday/Cyber Monday has been a bust, in desperate need of advice to get conversions.","Hi all - 6 weeks ago I opened my very first e-commerce site and I asked for critique of my site. Since then I've done my best to implement as many suggestions as I could on my limited budget. But I'm worried I still haven't hit the nail on the head.  After a disappointing holiday weekend and a couple hundred dollars in the hole, I'm asking for more advice. 

To give you some background I've placed Facebook and Google Ad campaigns starting on Friday (11/27) at 12 am. Since then I've had over 200 website clicks but not one conversion. I know that you usually only convert 1 - 2% of traffic, so I would have been elated just to receive one sale but unfortunately, that has not happened. The part that is so confusing is that most of my Facebook ads were ads for specific products, so when someone clicked on the product ad (that listed the price) they were taken to the page of that product but then decided not to go any further in the purchase process... 

I'm hoping you may be able to give me some additional feedback on my site and product pages. I've tried my best to incorporate as many best practices as possible including multiple images, exact measurements, descriptive product copy, material composition details and even recorded videos of the clothing to give buyers a better look at the product (although do these look too amateur? maybe that's turning people off?).  If you could please provide any thoughts on areas of improvement so that I can convert browsers into buyers, I would appreciate it! I'm thinking of shutting off all ads now but trying to stay hopeful....

Thank you so much in advance for your time!

Here are 2 of the ad landing pages for reference, but feel free to critique any other part of the site as well:

ecommerce,Looking for a positioning map / perceptual map for eCommerce platforms,"Hello there,     
I am looking for a way to break down eCommerce platforms by their offerings, but a little more specific. I want to place them on a positioning map, or try to separate their offerings by the industries they are most applicable too - ie. (Shopify - Ideal for fashion industry with lifestyle themes, easy checkout and retail integrations) or whatever the industries of appeal or marketing focus may be.   
Basically trying to separate the many platforms by industries most beneficial to the platform.   
If anyone can point me in a direction of a study or solid comparison, that would be unreal....  Thanks guys, have a wonderful day.",4,6,2015-11-30,ECOM,0.013091988861560822,0.9006783962249756,0.08622962236404419
