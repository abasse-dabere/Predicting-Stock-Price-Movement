dropship,Double up your income by upselling your products.,"Here is the explanation.

Let's consider you are spending $5 for every customer to buy a product from your store.

You are selling your product at a price of $11.

Shipping charge id $2.

The real cost of the product is $3.

If you Sum up you are spending $3 +$2 +$5 = $10 for every $11 product. So you make $1 right?

So you have to make 100 sales to get $100.

Now Let's consider an Upsell page.

You are spending the same amount on ads.

Worst scenario the person orders only one product.

On checkout, he is given an offer on the same product for $8 if he adds extra 2 to his cart.

Another Upsell  page $6 each for extra 4 to cart

Let's imagine the person is accepting the second offer. 

So you make extra $24 from the Upsell page. So you make $25 for every sale. 

You only need to make 8 sales to make $100.

This is how successful people do their business. Feel free to ask me questions about this",6,7,2019-09-01,ECOM,0.02669343911111355,0.9282205104827881,0.045086029917001724
shopify,"Affiliate Marketing App With A/B Tests, Advanced Analytics and Traffic Segmentation","Hello guys!

A few weeks ago we have released [GrowthHero.io](https://www.growthhero.io/)  \- a platform to manage and optimize partner programs. I would love to hear what do you think about the app, any feedback would be much appreciated.

The idea was to adapt the ""Build -&gt; Measure -&gt; Learn"" cycle from LEAN methodology into Affiliate Marketing. We did it by introducing the 3 steps loop:

1. Run A/B Tests  
Test different referral link destinations using customer segments to get actionable reports.
2. Measure &amp; Learn  
Use our analytics with a build-in click funnel to compare the results and learn about your customers.
3. Boost Affiliate Revenue  
Create redirect rules for each segment based on experiment results to increase conversions.

So, in short, you are able to set a referral link destination based on active segments. For example, you can redirect mobile users to optimized for a mobile landing page or redirect loyal customers to a promo page with a special offer. You can run split testing to figure out the best redirects. When the experiment is done, you can define redirect rules from winning options and continue investigating another segment.

dropship,A simple hack to promote increase your conversion rates.,"When ever you make an ad or headline, explain how the product can solve a problem for the costomer.

Make a single line statement that explains the solution even if the it is an entertainment product.

It should tell the customer why they must buy the product. That's it you'll get lots of I conversion.

Concentrate more on conversion rates else you'll be loosing lot of money. 

Think about the ad. Put yourself in the place of customer and answer these questions.

Is this statement is enough to convince to click on it ?

Why should I buy this product ?

Why should I buy it from this website ?

I’m hoping the redesign will fix this plus moving to a platform that will make SEO and page creating much easier.

My long tailed question is though, while we use YOTPO and have 250+ reviews combined from our SKU’s we have about 700+ reviews 4.8/5 average star rating for those same SKU’s on Amazon where we see more traffic and better conversion rates, though about half as much profit due to their fees and advertising, so should I include any kind of linkage to our Amazon listings from our e-commerce website?

We do allow customers to physically come into our offices to pick up orders, but its not advertised on our site and mostly a courtesy for local businesses that we supply. Not even .05 of our online business comes from the state we're physically located in. 

However someone long before me made our company a Yelp profile, and no one bothered to keep an eye on it. Now there's a 1.5 star rating from Yelp on the 3rd-5th SERP for our branded queries, which outranks all the other review sites (average 4.5 stars) we direct customers to after sales. 

Yelp's site seems largely devoid of any policy or troubleshooting for removing a business, but makes it clear that they're for local businesses (which we are not).

ecommerce,Fed Up: Thinking about not accepting Credit Cards on my Ecommerce site,"So I have been in the prelaunch stage of my business, we sell a subscription box full of smoking supplies that are hemp based. This has caused EVERY bank and merchant account provider to deny me immediately. The only ones that may be willing to accept me have cancellation fees over $500 and don't give me very good rates. 

I have recently been in talks with Hypur, a paypal alternative for the cannabis industry. 

This was the exact issue I was trying to avoid by selling the smoking products rather than smokeable substance itself. But anyone near this niche is considered a criminal in today's America so I guess I'm limited on options. 

My users would need to quickly create an account with Hypur, username and password, then log in to their bank once, after this they can click ""pay"" and the funds get transferred from their bank account to mine. Minus a 3% flat fee. 

The sign up process takes 1 minute, would this be devastating to potential customers and turn a large amount of them off? Inputting credit card info takes just as long in my opinion. 

I would obviously include information on my site as to exactly what the Hypur company is, how it works, and why we're using them rather than traditional credit cards. 

The unfortunate thing is that my competitors, who sell similar products and OPENLY ADVERTISE MARIJUANA are able to accept credit cards. Every merchant I've talked to says that they can only see it happening in a shady way so I guess money talks... 

I would love to hear if having to sign up with another company would stop you from making a purchase? How can I make it less intimidating for my users? Is it worth it to be able to actually launch and start selling product or just keep waiting in order to find someone that will allow me to accept credit cards?

But this was one of my first Times building at a whole store using this method and I wanted to trust a back-end that would help make it easy for customers to browse. Some of the products she makes well the other ones are bought from a third-party supplier that she normally does business with. And over the course of the past couple years we've been building the site making refinements and put it live around two years ago. We built a Facebook page as well as trying to get some social media presence on it as well but for some reason we're not seeing any products being sold on it we had several sales but not to what she was expecting. I was just curious as to what I can do to either spruce up the presentation of the site to make it more appealing and easier to buy or if there is some other method in order to gain buyers and viewers on it cuz I'm kind of baffled right now. I looked into using Facebook ads to draw tension as well as using Pinterest and other sites I can see having the market for this sort of thing. I also try to make it as mobile-friendly as possible since according to our Analytics people use their phones more often to get onto the site then desktop. This is a no way a spam post on buying stuff I just want to make that clear, I just want to know how we can get more exposure or if there is some way to make this site a little bit more marketable online since I think the products that she is selling his kind of niche.

dropship,Why I stopped buying iPhones!,"This is a personal post that I want to share with you...

When I first graduated from the university, I found a very good job with a very good salary. ( I am an engineer by the way).

I was getting 1800$ per month (after tax), which is compared to my friends and family was a huge income!

so I decided to buy an iPhone. The price of the iPhone I bought was around 900$ which was half of my salary! back then I didn't feel I was doing something financially wrong. At the end "" I deserve a bit of luxury!"".📱

10 years later, I make a lot more than 1800$ and my phone is a Huawei lite 10 which cost me less than 280$... Now I have more money, but I am much more financially aware!

Owning an iPhone is a total waste of money, an iPhone will not bring me money and after owning it for one year I will lose half of it is price!

With years, I have learned that buying luxury things is a bad move... I learned to buy things that ""will make me money"" not that "" will cost me money""...

Now reflect this same thing on the business you are building.. you say I will not invest money on a theme or on a course or on a good app although these if used in the right way will bring you money! ... but you spend you money on buying things that will not bring you a dime!

Investing your money in the right place and where you are using it to make money is a life lesson that I have learned! and I wish you will learn it as well! 💵💵",68,17,2019-09-05,ECOM,0.07766809314489365,0.8836565017700195,0.03867536038160324
shopify,Thoughts on a new Shopify app?,"The inspiration to develop an all in one sales optimisation app actually came from this community. A few discussions related to high monthly app expense got me thinking, why build everything separately when it can be done centrally. We talked to some merchants and survey showed interest related to it and we developed it. After 6 months of development, our all in one sales optimisation app consists 32 apps in one including:

\- Drag and drop page builder

\- Product bundle upsell

\- Volume discount

\- Preorder

\- Upsell funnel

\- One click upsell

\- All in one seo

\- Sticky add to cart

\- Cart countdown and more

We are still in public beta and I would love to get feedback from reddit community :)

dropship,Social media ads vs Google ads,"There is a big difference between social media ads vs Google ads. 

Use can use both for your business.

But if you are selling a new product that people are not aware of, use social media ads. 

If you are selling products that people are already searching on the internet use Google ads.

Both can bring in sales. Use them effectively so that the cost per click is as low as possible.

Last month I spent $10 per day on Google ads. Then I improved my ad now I'm spending $2 for the se traffic.

Ads can easily be modified to perform better.

If you are selling products that are already available in the market go for Google ads. Why to loose the hot traffic that are already searching on internet.

If you make an offer these people are definitely going to buy it. And it costs less.

Constantly follow your ads. If the conversation rate is low try changing few things. 

If you are using image use some bright Colors like yellow red etc.. people tend to click on these ads.

One more important thing. Don't advertise your store directly. Advertise a product.",7,8,2019-09-06,ECOM,0.023216132074594498,0.930685818195343,0.0460980199277401

The email address is in fact linked to a verified paypal account. There are no spelling errors on shopify, ebay or paypal regarding the email address. The one weird thing is that in my ebay account when I look at the paypal account tab it does not recognize the paypal account as verified though when i click the link it takes me to a paypal page that says it is verified. I don't think that should even be an issue though as the email is most certainly connected to a paypal account.

ecommerce,Where do you advertise? What works in your case?,"I own a small furniture selling website. We did really well in a past, but then something changed. Big folks jumped into a game and now killing all small retail including furniture niche - it's going on for years. Namely, Wayfair is big player on this market, ending each year with even bigger losses in millions of dollars. Amazing strategy to kill everyone - staying in minus themselves, hoping everyone will just go off business giving them the share and they'll magically end up on top.

Anyway. That is not a question. Question is: what really works for you in a matter of advertising? We used Google Ads in a past and they stopped working on for us a long time ago - I just have a feeling you have to have either huge budget to properly run it or stay away (price for clicks is ridiculous and quite a good number of them is quite fake). By Google Ads I mean Google Shopping - regular text ads were not effective in our case, ever. 

Facebook worked for us from time to time. Facebook is really strange beast, it might work this month and next month is absolute flop, B might not work today but magically provide amazing results in some time. No rules you can follow, nothing you can use and re-use, because it's simply unpredictable.

We have Amazon account but furniture is really specific business and we don't service every area, thus can't really run Amazon Advertising (as far as I last checked, they have no limitations based on geolocation which is crucial for us).

Pineterest/Twitter ads were mostly waste of money.

Pricegrabber/Shopzilla/etc. - waste of money in the end as well.

ecommerce,Did You Know You Can Track Shopify App Store Installs as Events and Goals in Your Google Analytics,"## Step One: Go the Your Shopify App Store Page

Visit the landing page of your app store. It should look something like: **apps.shopify.com/yourappname**.

## Step Two: Inspect your Add App button as an element

If you’re using Chrome, right click your purple “Add App” button and inspect element.

## Step Two: Look for the Event tracking data in the source code.

In the source code you will see “event” tracking data that you can easily copy and paste. It should include the Event Category, Action, and Label.

## Step 3: Add Event tracking data as a Goal in Google Analytics and Verify

Give your Event a name like “App Installs”, select event and fill out the fields as shown in the image. Then click “Verify” to see if it’s working. Hopefully you see the “0% conversion rate” change to something above “0”. That should tell you it’s working, unless nobody has yet clicked “Add App” yet on your landing page.

## Step 4: Save your Goal

Click the blue “Save” button and you are all set.

## Step 5: Start tracking users who install your app.

This is the exciting part. You can now isolate people who click “Add App” and learn everything about their history like what website they came from, what they search for in the Shopify App Store, where they live, and so much more.

ecommerce,Shopify Inventory Management App?,"Hey there everyone,  


I'm looking for an inventory management app for Shopify that allows me to also keep track of my raw materials.  


I make handmade tobacco pipes for a living, and it's quite a pain having to keep track of 100s of different acrylic stems and 30 variants of wood blocks in my workshop.  


  
For Example:

It would be nice to load my ""raw materials inventory"" and then whenever I make a new ""Large pipe with Blue Swirl Stem"", the app subtracts 1 Large wood block and 1 blue swirl stem from my Raw materials count, and then adds 1 Large Pipe with Blue Swirl Stem to my Shopify inventory.   


Also, if the app could send an alert when I'm running low on something, that would be a bonus, but not a necessity.  


I hope that was a detailed enough description of what I'm needing. Please reach out if clarification is needed :)

woocommerce,Etsy Refugee trying to replicate Custom Orders and Production Times -- Any thoughts / recommendations?,"I currently have an Etsy shop and I'm in the process of recreating it in wooCommerce on my existing WP site.

There is a huge amount of capability in wooCommerce and I'm looking forward to really expanding what I can do.  Until then, I've got two pieces of Etsy functionality that I'm trying to find a suitable replicate for:

1. **Production Time** \- my products (3D printed board game inserts) take a while to print, so I typically run with a 2 - 3 week lead time.  I've installed / configured the Advanced Custom Fields plugin and I'm closing in on hacking the code to display that field on the product pages.  Any other alternatives that might be a little less intrusive?
2. **Custom Orders** \- This one seems to be a little harder to pin down in the plugins universe.  My typical custom order is for one of my inserts in a different color.  Is there existing functionality in wooCommerce that makes that easy for these one-off products derived from an existing product?  I don't need all the color variation trappings that the existing product has, just a static copy that I can update the text or title on.

We sell shirts, hats, books and similar ""stuff"", direct to consumer and wholesale to small retail stores.   


Our store has been a very low priority for years - and we've had a dysfunctional full-suite 3PL. We want to change EVERYTHING. New e-commerce site, 3PL, inventory, marketing.   


We have about 10-20 orders a day and do a few in-person events every year where we have 300+ orders.   


Our primary goal is ""awareness"" rather than profit. We want people to have items that support our cause and feel good. We have big potential (because of a  brand that people love) and our massively under-resourced store has been holding back order volume. Well run, our store could do a few million dollars in sale a year (comparing ourselves to other nonprofits).

dropship,What Really Moved The Needle On My Store And Got Me Where I Wanted With Dropshipping,"As we all know first impressions count, and in the E-Commerce space the **first 2 seconds** are crucial to the buying process and to the success or failure of your business.

I spent hundreds of hours pouring over and learning from what all the experts were doing and saying, learning how to successfully and repeatedly build online stores.

After years building and perfecting my own and my clients e-commerce stores, I noticed that the greatest impact to whether the store would be a **success or failure,** not only now but in the future, was whether they had taken the time to **build a brand.**

**How do you build a Brand?**

The easiest way to communicate to your customers that yours is a real brand and not some random collection of dropshipping products is to have a **consistent visual identity**.

The best way to communicate that your brand is real is by **uniquely combining design, logos, and copy** to create an image that identifies your product and differentiates it from your competitors. Over time, this image becomes associated with a level of **credibility, quality, and satisfaction** in the customer's mind.

It's important to not only have the knowledge to implement all the different elements and platforms for your store but to do so in a way that compliments the users experience, **driving sales** and **reducing bounce rates.**

Take for instance this store, when we first were introduced, it was clear that they had a good business with a lot of potential but that they were leaving a lot of sales on the table.

shopify,New Upsell App,"Hi all!

My name is Shawn and I'm from a development agency called RAID, we recently built an app for upselling that we're gonna be listing up on the Shopify App store soon!

Why we created our own upsell app was mainly because with other apps we've used, we realized that it's just not that simple for merchants who don't have the time to learn, as well as many of these apps don't give you the controls you need, in terms of functions and design.

We aim to help merchants create quick upsells with useful templates, and give them the functions and design aspects they need to create an upsell that looks nice and works well with good analytics. Creating an upsell would also be easy because it's modelled after Shopify's theme builder.

If you're interested in trying it out and helping us with feedback do let me know!

Here's what our app can look like: [https://gph.is/g/aeYgQwA](https://gph.is/g/aeYgQwA)

We get about 350k monthly site visits, and I've noticed just in the two months that I've been here, the site has been completely down at least 10x a month.

woocommerce,Woocommerce vs Prestashop,"Been developing websites for clients, and more and more ask for eshops. Until now I've been using woocommerce as WordPress is my platform of choice when building websites for clients.

Although, I see that many of my clients get lost in the WordPress administration menu, while other carts are very straight forward in how they're used, how variable products are set, filters etc.

Been testing Prestashop lately and I find it very easy to use from a clients point of view. As well as out of the box features. The cost of extensions etc is higher, but it's a cost that can be transferred to the client, so no big deal there.

What is the opinion of people that have used both platforms? We're not talking about shops with 5-10 products ofcourse where woocommerce is no-brainer. We're talking about real retail shops with 500-10000 products plus variations.

shopify,"Store Move and Restoration, 1st Month on Shopify, $3.5k, all Organic, Now for Social...","My store has been around for a while, but my migration to mobile was a series of failed efforts, and business suffered a lot. Now I'm rebuilding on Shopify.

At our former peak we averaged $65k a month. I don't expect to get back there (the industry and competitive landscape has changed), but I'd like to get up to $10-15k a month at least, and then add a few more stores.

My problem, is that, like my site, I've been stuck in the past. My SEO is still solid, first page if not first position, but search is a much smaller piece of the pie these days and the SERPs themselves have been pushed further down the page.

Social is also a problem. I had a bad experience when FB first launched their ad platform, and never revisited. My brand presence is also lacking, w/ maybe 2.5k FB followers, less on Twitter, even less on YouTube, and zero on Instagram, Snapchat or Pinterest. Heck, I've never even used Snapchat!

My one saving grace is that the bulk of my customers are boomers and gen X, whose shopping habits are more likely to include brick and mortar, branded ecommerce, Amazon, and FB, where younger shoppers are doing more direct buying on Instagram and Snapchat.

Essentially, I don't have to fully dive into the world of selfies and stories and micro-influencers yet, but I do have to start moving in that direction and learning those platforms from a marketing perspective. I have a 5 star seller account on Amazon, but they make it hard to make money, IMO, so FB ads is my first target.

FB should make transitioning onto Instagram the logical next step, though the way FB makes everything so convoluted makes me wonder if I'm going to eat those words.

Long story short, imagine you went to sleep for a decade and woke up today looking to get back up to speed as quickly as possible, what resources would you hope that people would share with you?

You vaguely understand that people message each other selfies with cartoon dog noses and then one-click buy sunglasses with acetate frames, but the very concept is alien to you. Which direction would you want to be pointed in?

Basically I'm looking for encouragement and some solid resources on how to best take advantage of these platforms/channels in combo with my new Shopify store. Cheers!",7,8,2019-09-18,ECOM,0.04639945551753044,0.9199312329292297,0.033669378608465195

ecommerce,Help Needed with First Website after First Facebook campaign .,"Hello and thank you in advance to anyone willing to help with some insight.

As title indicates this is my very first website. Took 2 years to design, get products in and add descriptions. Launched two weeks ago. Slowly launching as I am trying to learn the next aspects of building blog, instagram and facebook for organic traffic. Have done very little for seo aside from front page and blog posts, I plan on hiring and starting a budget with an seo company for domain authority in the long game. 

So I had a go at my first facebook campaign and created a video ad introducing website and type of products. My first initial goal with this ad is to build my emailing list to re-target with my monthly newsletter. In exchange for email I offered the typical 10% off first purchase plus an additional 150 reward points that I offer to members on website. They would have received the reward points after purchase as a registered user. So 10% for email and guest purchase, further incentive to get a registered customer with 150 reward point offering.  Users were instructed to visit my page and sign up for newsletter in the sign up box located at the bottom of any page of website. I tried to anchor the link to go directly to sign up box but it doesn't work all the time.

My ad has had 4900 impressions and 139 link clicks at 10 dollars a day for 7 days. Not one of those clicks ended with an email sign up.

I optimized the ad for traffic and link clicks. My initial audience was very broad targeting 170,000,000 people. I sell natural skincare and bath and body so the audience and its demographics have a large audience on face book as is. So included in my targeting were people who were interested in natural skincare, natural hair care, bath and body, natural lotions, essential oils, ETC.  I also included men as i sell men's products, engaged shoppers, online shoppers, etc. 

Changed my audience half way through campaign to omit men, engaged shoppers, online shoppers and changed age range from 18-65 to 35-65, this lowered my audience range to around 59,000,000, although lower than 170,00,000 I suspect this is still too broad?

According to analytics average session is 2 min 20 sec, bounce rate averages at about 80%. It seems to be something wrong with website as 95% of people are bouncing off the home landing page, about 5% of users have navigated to shipping, about us, my account, and other product pages...

dropship,Instagram Influencers Are So Underrated,"Honestly influencers are so underrated. So many gurus say ""start with FB"" ""only use Facebook"".FB LAA is the best form of marketing that FB has and is everyones end goal so why waste money on Facebooks less effective forms of marketing.

It's sad I see so many wasting hundreds of their hard earned marketing dollars testing with FB, giving FB poor data.

In my experience its a good option to start with influencers. Now I mean INFLUENCERS most of you don't even know what a real influencer is... I see you guys paying theme pages for promotion saying it's an influencer it's not. It's a theme page. The audience of a theme page has no connection with the owner meaning it is no different then starting with FB ads targeting cold traffic.

The audience of an influencer is very engaging. They look up to the influencer. They know, like and trust the influencer. If an influencer recommends your product to their audience best believe their audience will hop on it real quick.

You can easily spend a few hundred on a few GOOD influencers and shortly after launch have enough sales to jump into LAA's. While with FB ads you would be lucky if you got to the LAA stage with $1k. Quit limiting yourself to one avenue of marketing. There is a reason big brands pay big bucks (upwards of $10k) for influencer promotions.",20,11,2019-09-20,ECOM,0.026939790695905685,0.9343957304954529,0.038664452731609344

I got around 5-6 sales per influencer a total of 55 sales. I spent $180 and made almost $2k in sales! Now if that isn't a good ROI I dont know what is.

Total profits are about $500 profit. Which is absolutely nuts. So I guess moral of the story is don't limit yourselves to one platform, use both! Now I have 55 total orders and if I run it again with 10 more influencers I will have close to enough to start LAA on FB ads.

ecommerce,Need some advice related to fees.,"So, I do dropshipping.
My question is related to Stripe- How do you guys manage the fees?
I live in Europe, and, for me, to legally do this, I get to pay about 45% in fees. Why? Because since I use an Ltd. to run Stripe, Legally Stripe needs to send the money to my business bank account, and from there to my private account. ( this is the process that takes the 45% fees)
Ideally I would love to just send the money from Stripe to my personal account, as I hear some of you guys do, but I do not understand how. If Stripe sends the information to my countries IRS I will get fucked with huge penalties for avoiding fees, since I use an Ltd. to use Stripe. 

A little better option is to create a Stripe account as a Sole Proprietorship, but I need to pay a 20% fee legally anyways.

So, how do you guys do this?

dropship,Dropshipping Clothing - Sizing Advice,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some helpful advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a clothing store that i made with Shopify, i drop ship clothes from Oberlo - I know a lot people are doing this...

&amp;#x200B;

What i need to know is, how are people converting the sizing of the clothing item to which the customer country resides in. I am from the UK, I am looking to get most of my customers from here. I understand i do not have many options here in the UK when it comes to drop ship because of delivery times and Asian sizes etc. What will you say the best solution for me is?

I do not care if it takes me a decade, i am in this to make it work so i will put in whatever - trial and error.

All comments / advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i would like to point out that i have been so far using sizing charts that come with the item, along with editing the sizing variants and letting the customer know they need to check the sizing charts prior to their orders. The only problem with this is i do not want to give my customer ore work to do, I want them to see a product they like add it to the basket and enjoy... Its bad enough they have to wait long delivery times let alone receiving a product that does not fit them correctly. Is their another way around dropshipping Maybe from a UK dropshipper? any help IS NECESSARY - MAYBE I AM JUST COMPLICATING THIS WAY TOO MUCH!!!

shopify,What tools do you wish you had as a Shopify store owner?,"Hi guys! So I’ve been building some tools and private apps for my gf's Shopify store, primarily on pricing optimization, but also other cool visual works and data stuff here and there. My actual job is the CTO of a tech startup (Y-Combinator funded) that used to be an online betting exchange, which unfortunately failed =( So, I figured maybe we could make a public Shopify App out of the things I already built for my gf, and perhaps add more features on top. 

So, I’m here to take suggestions from store owners on what tools would you like for your store that you wish you had? Can be anything from cool visualization effects to data analytics (our startup team is four ex-senior software engineers and data scientists from Facebook.. etc so we can probably build anything you want into an app). Please pm/chat me or comment below anything that comes across your mind. If you feel like it’s hard to put your thoughts in a message and are open to have a call with me, please pm me and I’ll send you a calendar link (the call would clearly be free; in fact you would be helping me out here so I’ll probably send you a $5 Starbucks gift card or something). 

p.s. I'm not trying to sell any developer services here. I’m purely trying to figure out what online store owners need that we can build into a public app/plugin so that multiple store owners can use it without having to pay for a developer. The app would probably be a free one with some upgrade features.

shopify,I speed tested every Shopify theme - here's what I found,"Hey all, I just finished speed auditing every Shopify theme on the store and some third party ones to find out which ones are the fastest (and slowest).

I thought you guys might find some of the results interesting. Might help when picking a new theme or switching to a new one. After all, slow load times kill conversions &amp; google rankings.

So without further ado, the fastest theme in the store is Debut. In fact, in the top 10 themes, the free ones make up 5 of them.

The slowest theme we tested was Fastor with a speed index of 21,176ms.

Take these results with a grain of salt however, part of the speed differential is from the extra features that third party themes are able to pack into their demo. While a third party provides an exit popup and countdown timer, a Shopify approved theme may not. 

I audited 3 key pages for each store 3 times, then took the median result. Those medians were then averaged to get a speed for the store. I focused on the home page, product page and collection page since those are consistently the core pages of a shop.

If you wanted to see how your theme performed, I published the full results at:  [https://www.rvere.com/whats-the-fastest-shopify-theme/](https://www.rvere.com/whats-the-fastest-shopify-theme/)

shopify,Ranting about Shopify's subpar chargeback deliberation process and lack of seller protections.,"I'm currently in contact with a representative about this entire ordeal, but I do suspect that absolutely nothing will happen, so I'm just jotting this down here for posterity while the entire thing is still fresh in my mind.

We make custom light up laptops skins primarily for DJs. Everything we do is custom made, and therefore it can be about two months until it arrives to your door once you pay.

Because everything is so custom made, there's a TON of communication with each customer, going back and forth on the design specifics and graphics, making modifications, and so on.

On June 14th, an individual paid for one of our custom made products after having firstly gone through the graphic design process and confirming their artwork and so on.

On August 9th, the customer received their finished product. On August 10th and 11th, the customer posted videos to their public Instagram and Facebook pages of the product in use. It would appear that they are happy with their purchase.

On August 18th, the customer filed a chargeback with the reason: fraudulent. Literally just one word. Shopify's automatic fraud detection system did not flag the transaction, it was seen as low risk. The name on the shipping address and billing address both matched up. The name also matched up with the person I was communicating with on Facebook during the preliminary steps of the order. I replied to the chargeback showing the ample proof that this was not a fraudulent order. Clearly, the customer just decided to get their item for free once they had received it. Once the item was delivered, I have had zero communication from the buyer, I was not made aware of any problems, and they did not ask for a refund. We offer a one year warranty for all of our customers.

The bank decided in favor of the customer, and I ended up losing the $240 + $15 Shopify chargeback fee + &gt; $110 cost of manufacturing and labor. So a total loss of nearly $400, that I end up being responsible for. I looked up the customer's name and find out via public records that he has a criminal record including marijuana/cocaine dealing/possession as well as something about an armed robbery. He is currently on parole for about 7 years for his last conviction from selling cocaine. He lives in Miami, but I guess it's not worth it for me to fly over there and file a small claim against him in the courts.

Okay back on topic. So I call up Shopify and explain everything. First person tells me I need to bring this up with the bank. Who is the bank? They don't know who the bank is either, she tells me to call MasterCard. I call MasterCard, they literally give me the f\*\*king number for Experian. Clearly people just trying to get me off the phone.

I call Shopify again, get a much more reasonable person on the line. He again tells me it's completely out of Shopify's control and I would need to bring this up with the bank. He has no idea who the bank is, he does not know how to get me in contact with the decision maker on this chargeback. I've been doing this for a while, at least in a PayPal chargeback the buyer and seller get to go back and forth for a period of time and then eventually PayPal steps in to make a decision. In this case, I received a one word explanation of the chargeback: ""fraudulent"", I provided ample evidence, and then once the case was settled, I received zero explanation and no opportunity for rebuttal. Furthermore, even Shopify representatives have no idea how to help me. He just explained that this was a failure in their fraud alert system, he tried to put the blame on my ""not lengthy/exhaustive enough refund policy"" (at what point did the customer ask for a refund? how is this my fault?). He explained that I should expect to absorb fraud like this because this is just how business goes, he recommended I use a PAID Shopify add-on that takes 1% of all my sales to offer additional fraud insurance. (Surprise, checking that app's reviews shows that they don't cover always cover ALL fraud either anyways.)At this point I just decided to beg for any sort of recourse. If Shopify can't do anything, can't they cover the loss? Maybe Shopify can give me a free year of service to cover my losses? Who knows at this point. I only make about $60-$80 per sale, so my profit margins are sort of low, and this isn't going to be easy to just write off and move on. He said he's going to get in touch with his superiors and get back to me to let me know if they're going to be able to do absolutely anything for me.

A recurring theme during the phone call was about how this is such an extremely rare case, and how the representative has only heard of this happening once before in his 1+ year with Shopify. If that's the case, and it's SO OBVIOUS that the customer is a scammer, why am I being expected to cover the loss? Shopify needs to be taking this up with the bank on my behalf and not just throwing me under the bus.

Why doesn't their fraud detection system incorporate free and publicly available criminal records? Why am I paying a monthly fee for their system and still being expected to cover blatantly obvious fraudulent behavior by the customer? Is there any sort of seller protection like PayPal has in place?

We've had over 1,000 customers. This is our first chargeback since moving over to Shopify. Been in business for about 3 years I guess.

dropship,Beginner Dropshippers (Must Read),"I see a lot of beginners fall in the trap of following fake gurus that just give fluff information and strategies. There is a lot more that goes into ecom and dropshipping then just finding a trendy product and then putting up a store. If you want to make the business work you need to stand out and not follow all the basic dropshipping tips.

You need to create a brand. Not a trendy store selling random products.

You need to find a product that will actually have an impact on someones life and benefit them in some way. Not just sell the same trendy dropshipping products everyone else sells.

You need to make your store look professional and put time and effort into it. Not just put it up in 10 seconds.

You need to learn SALES. Marketing is not sales it is traffic, sales is converting the traffic. This is why most of you get tons of traffic but no sales.

And you need to treat your store like an actual business not like a money making machine. It takes a specific kind of person to make the business work. And that is a person with a business mindset not a get rich quick mindset.

So I’ll be opening my online store soon. I’ll be running everything from my house and won’t have a physical address. I realize for email marketing you need to have a business address listed at the bottom. I obviously don’t want to put my actual home address on emails I send out to customers. One of my options is to get a PO Box. I know that big carriers like DHL or UPS won’t ship to PO Boxes. Most customers won’t use these carriers if they wanted to return products I’m hoping they’ll just use usps or whatever their country’s national post office is. What other options do I have other than opening a PO Box? For those of you that don’t have a physical business address what address do you guys use for email marketing?

Do you guys prevent selling something that has thousands of reviews on Amazon already?

I think the product is great and even my friend said she would love to have one, but the thing is whats stopping them from going to Amazon and buying it (probably for cheaper as they can afford to get wholesale price compared to my drop-shipping price.)

The issue I'm having is that I believe the content on my site is really good quality as well as I have been partnering with influencer to get the word out which can be seen on my Ig page however I still have not seen an increase in traffic or engagement.

All frames are designed by me and my partner, we have also professionally shot all the product photos to ensure the site looks professional however there is definitely something im missing as its not converting customer or even getting customer to view the product page.

ecommerce,Bluehost instantly locked me from my site WITHOUT warning,"It has been around one week, since one competitor of mine sent a fake DMCA complain to Bluehost. This guy even told me he did it. Bluehost took all my websites down then. No problem for me, I just removed the content, which was on a subdomain I don't really use anyway. After that they just activated my account.

Now here is the thing:

A few days later I received this email from Bluehost: ""Dear Customer:

Please be advised that we received the enclosed notice of alleged intellectual property infringement on your website. Based on our review of your account history, we have permanently suspended your account due to multiple and/or repeat infringement claims.

We have determined that we are not the most appropriate host for your business needs, and require you to seek hosting services elsewhere to service the domain, website, and email moving forward. Your account will be cancelled within 48 hours.""

And from this very moment one they LOCKED me COMPLETELY from my account. It was totally surprising, I had no chance to prepare or to download any file.

No access to websites, cpanel, ftp, email or any file! This is the worst!

I called them, I went to the live chat maybe 50 times and I sent multiple emails to the legal@bluehost.com as soon as I saw what happened. In the live chat all they said was I have to wait 24-48 hours for the reply of the legal@bluehost.com team.

I don't even asked them to activate my account. I only wanted to download BACKUPS, files and important emails, before I transfer to another hosting.

Guess what? The legal@bluehost.com team just didn't reply me within 48 hours. Even I know they viewed my case/emails much earlier, because someone from live chat support told me they have viewed it much earlier. So basically they were sitting it out until they can send me this email:

shopify,Your feedback would mean everything,"Hi everyone,

I started my shop about 6 months ago and definitely have not been as successful as some of the others I've seen here (incredible work!). I make most items by hand and have gotten great feedback on the items themselves, but perhaps I'm being blind to something? I'd love any and all constructive criticism and feedback you could give me after taking a look at my site. 

If you're a dog owner, what would inspire or dissuade you from buying my items?

Thank you very much to everyone for your help!

shopify,What do you use to backup and/or share theme files?,"Hey all,

What do you guys do to backup your theme files before editing? Also, what do you use for sharing code for review by outside developers?

I often see people asking for help to edit their liquid files but I don't think Shopify provides an automated way for a developer to see and make suggestions on the store's theme files. 

Along the same lines, if you screw up while editing a liquid file, how do you recover from it? Shopify has versioning for liquid files but not for any other assets you may have added to your store's code.

ecommerce,Web service/application recommendations for storing customers' credit cards?,"Before anyone says ""don't"", just hear me out, I'll try to be as brief as possible... Someone I know who works for an online shop (PCI-DSS class 3 by transaction volume) asked me this question.

They mostly use Shopify. Customers place orders through the website as you would imagine, or they call and a customer service rep puts in the order through Shopify. Sometimes they send out a Paypal invoice instead, and the customer pays through Paypal without going through Shopify. Pretty standard stuff, I think.

Some customers have asked if the company could keep their credit card on file, so they can call or email orders without giving the card info every time.

I am told that Shopify expressly does not support this, they just store the last 4 digits of the payment card for reference and nothing more, so the merchant can't reuse the card data for future transactions. I know some Shopify-based online stores have an option to ""remember your information for faster checkout"", with a feature called Shopify Payments, but it's not enabled for the site I'm talking about. Regardless, this wouldn't help with customers who want to place orders over the phone or fax or email or whatever.

None of the staff needs or wants to be able to see the customers' card info, they just need to be able to process orders as described above using a card that's kept on file in a manner that is PCI compliant. So they're looking for something that preferably integrates with Shopify. I found a Shopify plugin called Paywhirl that appears to do this, but I'm looking for actual ecommerce owners/operators who are willing to share what they use.

ecommerce,Information Architecture: WooCommerce verse Shopify. Are you seeing higher conversions?,"I just hired an SEO consultant to do a teardown and the one sentence caught my attention (he did a very nice job):

""There's also a huge opportunity to improve the UX / UI stuff through platforms like Shopify or a custom build. I wouldn't understate how great these changes could be for revenue.""

My information architecture needs to be re-done, but the question comes down to is worth it moving from WooCommerce to a premium/custom-built Shopify site.

From a high level, Shopify and WooCommerce are back-end and don't have much effect on the front-end, but has anyone seen significantly higher conversion rates from porting a store over to Shopify? 

A couple of examples; 

1) a premium Shopify theme UI is more recognizable to customers hence it might have higher conversions to begin with (due to the platform's global popularity and familiarity)

2) The checkout workflow is more streamlined leaving you with less abandoned carts

3) Abandoned Carts are easier to convert when retargeting / abandon cart workflow due to the UX flow",7,13,2019-09-30,ECOM,0.033309806138277054,0.785771906375885,0.18091826140880585

Shipping is 3.99 to every country and free over $40. It automatically changes price to your location (it works tested with VPN) and I’ve gone through the checkout process myself and there isn’t any red flags or issues.
