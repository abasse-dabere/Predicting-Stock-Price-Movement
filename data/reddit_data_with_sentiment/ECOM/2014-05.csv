ecommerce,Need a site critique,"Hi all, new user here.  I currently run 3 sites, one very successful ($1m + sales) that is my primary income.

I have two other sites that are lagging in sales.  They have tens of thousand of products, but are in highly competitive markets.

The site I would like to get a fresh set of eyes on is www.MassMarine.com.  The conversion rate is too low, as is the average ticket.

I get a high percentage of PayPal payments, which indicates a trust issue, but I am not sure.

SEO has really not been done due to time constraints, and an Adwords campaign was just restarted this month.

Any constructive criticism, or advice would be greatly appreciated.",13.0,3,2014-05-01,ECOM,0.016726607456803322,0.8671156167984009,0.11615783721208572

ecommerce,Is it practical to sell furniture online?,"I have an idea I've been kicking around for a couple months. It's a niche in furniture...a certain type of desk, to be more specific.

woocommerce,In the process of setting up a multi-vendor store - Woocommerce or Shopify?,"I'm setting up an art store, for few artist buddies of mine. The plan is to sell original art early on, and then offer art prints if we do well. We are looking at Woocommerce along with the [Product Vendor](http://shop.mgates.me/shop/wc-marketing/wc-product-vendor/) plugin so that artists can themselves upload their works. We are on a shoestring budget, and I'm personally setting up the site even though I have no PHP or CSS knowledge (I'm a writer).

1) Is Woocommerce + Product Vendor a good solution, say than Shopify? I would have wanted to go the Shopify route, but don't think we can afford every month payment. I think Shopify also does not let multiple vendors be on the single site, although I may be completely wrong. I'm most familiar with Woocommerce, but we could go with any solution that is easier and provides a profile system and product-upload mechanism for each vendor.

2) Is there a way to upload products on the frontend, using Woocoommerce? If there is, is it possible to restrict the size of the file so as to not overload the hosting server.

Greatly appreciate any help I can get.",4.0,3,2014-05-01,ECOM,0.03104383498430252,0.9305194616317749,0.038436729460954666

ecommerce,Ecommerce platform accepting deposits for products that won't be available immediately?,"I'm looking for an ecommerce solution to assist in selling cow shares online. 

Because of the nature of the business, you can reserve a portion of a cow (1/8th, 1 quarter, etc) with a deposit immediately. However, your product and final bill will be delivered later, because it will be calculated by the cost of the weight of the cow after slaughter. 

I'm interested in hearing what others suggest as the best platform for this. I've experimented a little bit with Shopify, but it looks like the cheapest option will be $30 per month plus $19 per month for an ""app"" that supports custom orders. That seems a bit high considering this is a really small store.

ecommerce,Going to use Shipwire and Shopify - let's talk numbers...,"Remaining vague, my product will cost approx $3.50-4 per unit (cheaper if I order more, however we'll be testing the market first with 2500 units).

Should I intend to sell at $20 (maybe including shipping), what are the numbers going to look like?

I know that Shopify takes a percent and charges monthly, Shipwire costs for handling along with other charges, and such factors will play a role in chipping away at my profit margin.

I doubt Amazon fulfillment would be any more economical, even though their Prime service would please all parties involved.

Taking all this into consideration, I'd love to learn where your numbers stand to better gauge what I'm diving into.

Granted, I could lower the price of my product (a unique product which has been developed from scratch by my company) and sell in large volume in multiple vendors/shops, or I could keep the price at a more profitable level with the target audience being limited yet sales are exclusive through our site

ecommerce,About Page Branding Design,"The Nine Secrets to a Killer About Us Page
You only have one chance to make a great first impression. Whether the arena is dating or online business, appearance and attitude make a huge impression on the mind of your audience. This makes marketers both cringe and salivate in simultaneous fear and ecstasy. But how do you go about maximizing your all important first interactions with a customer or consumer to your product or service? What is the best way to make a stellar first impression which will turn unsuspecting audiences into intrigued customers and loyal fans to die hard supporters…?

What are you ABOUT?
Sharing your message and your company’s personality is the best way possible to build these webs of influence and trust with prospective buyers. This can be done through branding, copywriting, and the traditional marketing and sales positions of shedding the best light possible about your startup or business.

For some crazy reason though brands and businesses online blow the best possible point of interaction. When you go to a website what is the first page you look at? Well inevitably if you are not just bargain hunting for the least expensive set of shoes or the cheapest consulting firm you will quickly transition from the homepage and product pages to the About Us page. People do this without even thinking. They want to know who they are doing business with and to decide whether or not they like and trust the person enough to stay on their site and make a transaction.

So why the hell do so few businesses take advantage of this potential gold mine of brand equity? This once in a lifetime chance to form a bond with their potential customers and really connect with them on a more deep and meaningful level. If you are like many of the bootstrapped business owners out there looking to grow your business while simultaneously providing the best customer experience possible then this is just the post for you. Get ready to re-evaluate your branding and company positioning and to truly share just what you are all about.

The 9 Keys to a Masterful About Us Page:
1) Share your Company Vision

Who are you? What do you stand for? Your customers want to get to know you better and understand your goals and aspirations. If you are morally against pollution or dedicated to helping small businesses grow then share that. Why should people care about what you do? You have to bring them in to your vision of the world and your powerful team to let them feel united in the cause. If you have flagship products with a particularly interesting story you should share them. Share your motivating forces when creating your business and now people no longer have some small and insignificant product or service, they have a story they can share. And share it they shall. No one cares that you just bought a pair of shoes but if suddenly that pair of Tom’s shoes helped a starving child in Africa then you truly have something to be proud of and tell to the world. Yellow Hammocks  Masterful Examples: Yellow Leaf Hammocks, Basecamp

2) Not what but who?

Show the men behind the masks. People do business and have relationships with people. The social environment we all live in and are evolved to crave is the very thing that can help you grow your business and boost your brand. Let people know who you really are by being relateable. Showcase pictures and descriptions of your employees and the core team to let clients know the personality behind the faceless wall of the internet. Even adding social media profiles or funny facts about members of you company all help outsiders to get a better grasp of who your company really is and what they stand for. This seriously boosts trust and subsequent conversions.

What if you had boxes, pallets, skids, etc?  Would you be able to pack all the items onto one pallet or crate if there was one larger item that warranted the large packaging, and pack it with a few smaller items?  

I haven't found any eCommerce packages which come with or any eCommerce packages even with paid plugins/addons that allow for easy and correct pricing.  

How would you expect a courier integration to work?  Have any companies truly mastered this multiple item box packaging algorithm yet?

ecommerce,E-commerce solution for 10000+ digital products and easy option for customization selection for orders?,"I am wondering if there were any suggestions for an e-commerce solution that would allow me to sell a lot of digital products (like mp3s, pdfs), but with a degree of customization.  

I would have a core group of items. Then, for each one I would want to allow people to choose something with their name in it, so they would have to be able to easily select the version of the item relevant to them. Like they could input their name, and then that would select the product that is customized for their name (that is already prepared, being hosted). Something like a text box where they could type in ""Mar"" and then it would auto complete/select the ""Maria"" item. Because having to choose from a drop down menu of over 200 names would be too difficult for most users. But repeat this process for the other different items. Something like that or easier. The thing is that each item would have like 200+ variations based on the different names available (think like those placemats with children's names on them), and I would it to be as easy as possible for someone to find the one they want, and then go to check out. 

Maximum budget would be around the Shopify $179 month or LemonStand $139 month plan.

I am currently building an online tool which lets you look at previous and current top 10 best sellers on Amazon, in every category. The database shows the ten most popular items from the past weeks and today with daily updates, including price, stars, number of reviews and how many times a particular item has been in the top 10 before.

The goal is to help you identify popular niches and products over a period of time.

I was reading another Reddit thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1z4mc1/has_anyone_used_squarespace_for_an_ecommerce_site/) where it seemed like squarespace is not suited for an actual eCommerce business.

What were the limitations you ran into? Good things, bad things?  

I would have a core group of 50-100 items, but each item would have 200+ variations (think people's names). Is this something possible for Squarespace? Thank you.

woocommerce,Need my Woocommerce cart / checkout pages fixed. Anyone want work?,"I hope this is ok to post here. I not let me know and i'll remove it. 

Heads up: I literally just got done having someone rebuild [the website.](http://www.modelrailroadbenchwork.com) This request is simply to handle issues were beyond the builders capabilities.    

The website is Wordpress - modelrailroadbenchwork.com

. 



**Current site issues/repair requests:**  

* My store is Woo Commerce.  I need the cart quantities to be adjustable by hitting enter or I need an additional Update cart button by the cart instead of just in the cart totals box. (it's hard to find) 

* I need a few questions added onto the cart page in dropdowns instead of the checkout page so the answers given can be added or subtracted from the cart total. The questions are as follows: 

-------------------------
Do you need a starter kit?

* &lt;select&gt;
* manual (screwdriver) starter kit $15
* Power drill Starter Kit $15
* No 

Do you need extra assembly screws?

* &lt;select&gt;
* 100  $5
* 200  $10
* 300  $15
* No 

Drilled hole preference

* Normal 
* No 1 inch wire Holes please
* No 1 inch or bolt holes please - 5% discount

Comment Box  - clients often make special requests 

-----------

The last thing I need done to the cart is **I need the payment to be done completely Manually on my end.** I do not want to give them my mailing address or Paypal information until I have looked over the order and made any adjustments they requested.  All I need them to do is select their payment preference: 

* Cash in person 
* Check / money order 
* PayPal
* Credit card via Paypal (no account necessary) 

They should then be able to submit their order. Once I receive it I will look it over, make any adjustments to the total needed based on their special requests and send them the correct payment information.   I realize this is a bit unorthodox but it works very well for what I do. 

***^If ^you ^have ^ideas ^on ^how ^to ^make ^the ^cart/checkout ^process ^smoother ^let ^me ^know.*** 

**Non WOO work**

* Fix the FAQ page so the questions toggle open/close  (I have all of them set to open because they will not open otherwise at the moment. Feel free to use another type of toggling code.

* Eliminate the Extra WP accounts. The wordpress site has a lot of users I did not add but i'm not sure if they are tied to anything important. If they are not, I would like them all deleted except for the admin (my account). 


* Make an exact copy of the modelrailroadbenchwork.com site on mrrbenchwork.com

Or

**B.** Buying directly from china and having them shipped to you and you do the shipping yourself. Can include ""next day shipping from USA"" somewhere on the site to encourage buyers. You then eat the shipping costs if you offer free shipping though.

**To the buyer the only difference for them is:**

**A.** They pay. They get item in 10-30 days.

**B.** They pay. They get item in a a couple days to a week.


**Difference for person selling:**

**A.** Chinese dropshipper eats the cost of shipping or you pay which is still cheaper when shipping from China. But, potentially get less customers because of wait time.

**B.** You eat the cost of shipping or charge customer (which could turn customers off with all the free shipping everywhere; could offer free shipping over orders of $xx to help mitigate costs). Less profit margin, but potentially more customers.

ecommerce,Does this solution exist?,"I've spent a bunch of time researching various options, from WooCommerce, to BigCommerce, to Magento Go, to Magento, etc... But still haven't been able to find what I need. Posting here in hopes that maybe I missed something. The criteria I have are the following:

- Solution can be hosted by us (through 3rd party host) or by the native developer (Magento Go)

- Solution must be customize-able by a developer (Magento Go is out, Magento is still in)

- Solution must, ideally, integrate with WordPress (WooCommerce and BigCommerce, but those are not accessible to for back-end customization - correct me if I'm wrong)

ecommerce,Please critique my online jewellery store,"Hi everyone!

I started [Tingo Fine Jewellery](http://tingo.co.za) 3 months ago, an online jewellery store based in South Africa. I use Shopify as a platform.

A few things to mention:

* I have bootstrapped the business from my own pocket.
* The business only serves the South African market - which is pretty small and very reluctant to purchase online at this stage. I would guess they are quite a few years behind countries like the US and UK in this regard.
* Linking to my point above - the competition is very primitive and their websites all suck, so I think there is opportunity here to establish a good online business.
* My conversion rate is terrible - I have had one sale from more than 3000 unique visitors (mostly from PPC advertising.)

Please have a look and critique my site - feel free to be brutal, I will get over it! Would you order something from my site?

ecommerce,Which solution is best for my situation?,"I sell a single product but I need some uncommon options in my checkout process. My goal is to incorporate Ecommerce into a self-hosted website. I don't want to redirect customers to another website (like Shopify or Volusion) for checkout, but I'm willing to do so if there's not a better option.

Here's what I need during checkout:

- Standard input boxes (name, email, address, Etc.)
- Custom option boxes (drop-down and radio buttons)
- 2 free-text fields with character limits (400 and 1,000)
- Minimum order (50 pieces)
- Tiered pricing (prices go down as order volume goes up)
- File upload during checkout (important, but not a dealbreaker)

Shopify can do all of these with two (paid) apps. Unfortunately, that means I'll be spending a lot of extra money each month just to set up one product the way I want.

ecommerce,Accounting advice needed for blooming ecommerce site,"Hi All,

Spent a lot of time lurking and recently started posting. I have an ecommerce site where I sell very niche products at a decent margin. I would be willing to give more specifics, but over PM.

Started up about 2 months ago, and in the last 3 weeks I have had a steady stream of sales. Things are slowly picking up and I have product reviews coming from huge blogs in my industry. 

So, I need to get my accounting up to par. I use Shopify, but do not pay the $80 a month plan for the reporting. 

I use Wave as my accounting platform. Details:
1) Ecommerce site, 1 physical location (home/warehouse)
2) 3 products, multiple variants of each product (size/color)
3) Only generate revenue through Shopify sales (just started monetizing my Youtube videos for product reviews, but this is very recent).
4) Expenses include: inventory purchase (2 products in bulk), dropshipping purchase (1 product), marketing/advertising, office supplies, shipping costs, potential PO box costs.

What I need help with:
What is the basic setup I need to do to be up to par. What accounts do I need. How do I book sales? Do I book each individual sale, or just my Shopify Payouts? As you can see I have a long way to go with Accounting knowledge. I do get the concept of double entry accounting - what I need help with more is just initial setup.

Looking to ask some questions to someone who is familiar with accounting for ecommerce sites. We could do it here in a public forum so people can learn.

ecommerce,[QUESTION/ADVICE] What would be the best service to set up an online store for an already established family run wine company?,"Essentially, I've been asked to help set up an online store for my girlfriend's parents wine store. They are already well established within our area, and simply wish to allow customers to buy their products with a greater sense of ease - as opposed to simply calling up, or visiting their offices.

Their website runs of Wordpress, and they have Woocommerce installed. I've been looking around at different providers such as Strype (who aren't prevalent in Australia yet) and of course, PayPal.

However, as this is a small company, self-hosting a store seems to be a little bit too much effort.

ecommerce,Bridging the Gap: E-commerce &amp; Physical Store,"The growth of online shopping has been dramatic and ably aided by the advent of smartphones and tablets. Some of the reasons that make online shopping immensely convenient are – ability to shop and purchase from home, evade traffic snarls, long checkout queues and so on.
 
However, a brick and mortar store is able to draw customers by making every purchase a pleasurable experience. For example, the store’s interiors can be changed to promote seasonal collections and holidays. Helpful staff and leisurely trials help a customer feel at ease and come back for more. Plus the added benefits of touch and feel cannot be underestimated.
 
To bridge the gap between physical shopping and online shopping, companies are analyzing customer feedback to roll out new initiatives. Let’s take a look at some unique ideas that are a step in the right direction:
 
Same day delivery – Physical stores provide customers the satisfaction of going home with their product post payment. To recreate the same, online stores now offer same day delivery which could just be a matter of hours from the time of placing order.
Virtual Trials – Online retailers now offer users the ability try out a product virtually. The process is simple; a potential shopper uploads his/her picture. The software then allows you to try out products and choose the best product.
Innovative measurement – Retailers have devised simple methods of measuring size by using everyday objects. For ex: a popular optics retailer instructs customers to use a credit card to measure lens size.
At Home Trials – This feature not only mimics the real shopping experience but goes a step further! A shopper selects a number of products and orders them home for a trial before he makes his final choice. The shopper is able to look at, feel and try – all in the comfort of his home!
Product Customization – Online retailers now allow customers to order home a tailor, who will take your measurements, understand your choice of design and sew your product just for you. This highly convenient service allows you to experience a couture store at your beck and call.
 
With cut-throat competition, innovation in the e-commerce business has taken on an interesting turn and will be worth watching out for as companies’ battle it out to gain and retain customer loyalty.
 
Feel free to leave a comment if you would like to share ideas that you think will give online retailers an edge over brick-and mortar shops.

I just put up my bags dropshipping site and I wonder how to get sales :D
It's in here http://chcetorebke.pl/ It's polish for polish customers.

I think that I will use a few price comparison sites that will lead to it and Google Ads.

1. Do you know any quick guide that could get me into Google Ads? And what would be the best approach for such dropship site?

2. In the ecommerce system I use each product has a field for keywords and one called 'meta information'. 
How to research what keywords should be put in the main page? And what about description/meta, is it important?

3. Would you add something to my site? 
I've added a Facebook box and I think I should get some promotions running, rewards or limited coupon codes.

Feeling excited, any feedback appreciated :)

ecommerce,Host your own store or sell in a marketplace?,"I've encountered this question several times first and second-hand and I'd like to hear what the community thinks about it.  You have a product that you make or resell and you want to do it online. Mostly people stick with the marketplaces but I feel there must be a case when it pays to to strike out on your own.

It's very very easy to start selling on sites like eBay, Etsy etc and you can make decent money if you're good.  

PROS

* Instantly start selling.
* Practically guaranteed traffic.
* Bootstrap customer trust and CC info.
* Very low developer costs.

CONS

* Fees.
* Lack of control.
* Hard to stand out (without racing to the bottom on pricing).
* Traffic diverted to other sellers.
* Subject to harsh and unpredictable ToS.

On the other hand, you could make your own store. Pros and cons basically the inverse of the above.

PROS

* Full control--potential for great site content.
* No third-party fees to sell (though dealing with money always costs money).
* Expandable to broader business model (hosted products, real-world store, content creation, custom work etc.)
* It's cooler.

CONS

* Constant maintenance costs.
* Substantial developer costs.
* Payment processing sucks.
* Pay for traffic because nobody knows about your tiny website.

I've seen services like tictail or shopify which offer you some sort of compromise between the two models and many people seem happy with them.

I'm curious to hear from people who have made the decision to start their own site or have thought about it and been convinced against it.  Why/why not? Was it worth it?  Can you transition from eBay/Etsy to your own site?  

In my particular case I have experience with full stack development so I would handle the construction or at least maintenance of such a site.",4.0,5,2014-05-27,ECOM,0.040472835302352905,0.9349840879440308,0.02454308047890663
ecommerce,"Many products in one single table, showing pricing.","I have a potential customer who needs a different product display layout. 

[Example](http://imgur.com/7L3tXOm)

Instead of listing each product individually he would like to display the products in a table format. The example above is a representation of 45 products (in this case drill bits) in one table. They are sorted by size in the way his customers are accustomed to seeing them. He wants the price of the product to be displayed instead of the part number. In this format he can list 200+ in one presorted table without needing 200 product listings split at 10-20 a page. 

I am figuring if he was ok with the part number being listed then this would be a simple request in just about any package. Basic html linking the products with the ""details page"". It would be semi static, but his products don't change.

I'm doing a bit of research for a friend, a working Mum who's starting a small business retailing customised shoes online.

During working hours she can't accept deliveries at home - this is the main issue. e.g. customer returns

I know there are virtual office addresses / mail box type services, but they're expensive and do not offer support for parcels by default (typically).

I'm thinking along the lines of a PAYG hub/fulfilment service, what's out there? I've found collectplus, but their service doesn't seem to cater for the retailer to collect.

The retail Mum is based in Cardiff, Wales.

Do you guys know of local / national services, or the type of service I should search for? Or an alternative solution?

ecommerce,"[Question] What are the major differences between eWay, Braintree and Pin.net.au?","You guys were a big help last time I asked a question. I'm entirely new to ecommerce, so I can't thank you enough for this subreddit. I never knew what the hell full-stack payments were a few weeks ago, and here we are.

Last time we talked, you convinced me to use Shopify as opposed to Wordpress + Woocommerce due to its unnecessary complexity for my clients small business needs.

As we are small, we have no idea how much we're going to sell each month, and thus we're trying to minimize costs (which obviously comes at a price.)

When comparing the options, I made sure they were on Shopify's list of Australian compatibility amongst reading as many forum posts as I could on peoples experiences with each.

**Braintree:**

• Based in the USA making customer support a bit difficult to access if needed due to time zones.

• No signup fee.

• 2.4% +30c per transaction (which we're fine with due to the small scale of our operation).

• Next business day payment.

**Pin.net.au:**

• Based in our hometown of Melbourne making customer support a bit more reassuring for us.

• No signup fee.

• 2.6% +30c per transaction (which we're fine with due to the small scale of our operation).

• Holding period of 7 days of funds, which I don't understand why they do this?

**eWAY - (they literally changed their plans yesterday and are almost uncomparable to the above two, but I'm curious to hear what you say:**

• Based in Canberra, in Australia, which is slightly reassuring. I've gathered they have excellent customer support.

• $49 ""set-up"" fee, which was only introduced yesterday.

• 2.9% +30c per transaction (which we're fine with due to the small scale of our operation).

• No idea how they transfer money to the business.

So, all in all, I'm thinking Braintree, as we don't mind the extra .2% to receive our money quicker.

What do you all think needs to be considered amongst all of this?",3.0,1,2014-05-28,ECOM,0.028446320444345474,0.9207972288131714,0.05075651779770851

ecommerce,Please critique my 1 month old site,"Alright guys,

4 or 5 months ago I bought an English Bulldog. He inspired my site: www.bullymake.com. I spend about 4-5 hours a day after work improving my overall e-commerce knowledge.

In about 1 month I've progressed quite a bit (site has been live for ~1 month). Learned wordpress. Learned how to make some customizations on my site. Learned some SEO (still progressing with that). Learned Facebook Ads (very thoroughly, I consider myself pretty good at Facebook) and social media marketing. Built my e-mail list to 100 people.

I have yet to make a sale though. I think there are several reasons for this, but I'd like to hear yours. Let it be known I haven't directly advertised on my facebook page yet to send people to my shop. I have about a 1200 person following on facebook, of which about 30% of them are pretty highly engaged in my posts. I know (I think) the sales are going to come. I just need advice on getting there.

I market to Bulldog owners, and the products I offer are amazing quality, way better than the products you buy at pet stores. Do I need to portray that more on my homepage?

I know my site is so far from amazing. Please tear it to shreds. How can I improve it?

Please reddit, rip the shit out of it.

Cheers,

We are thinking of branching out in to other products for this niche market that are completely unrelated to LEDs but related to the niche product.

**thoughts on having new products on current site:**

Pros: We have the audience already coming to our site for LEDs. We have the infrastructure to support the additional product already in place.

Cons: People come to our site for mostly one thing right now. The additional products could create clutter among our core product.

**Thoughts on having new products on new site**

Pros: The new name would be more generic, which would fit the product better.

Cons: Starting all over with our SEO and marketing, getting customers from the first site to go to the second site for other products. Just getting customers to the site period. Not wanting to maintain 2 inventories of the same product from site 1, so we wouldnt sell stuff from site 1 on site 2.

I'm looking into selling some digital music content online and wanted to know your opinions on how I should tackle it. I have experience in coding php etc. and would be fairly confident setting up a way to sell such content through a website using something like PayPal.

However iTunes seems to be as prevalent as ever and I wanted to know whether you guys knew whether it would be more beneficial to me to just distribute on there? Do you think I would get just as many sales on a custom made website or do you think iTunes will drive traffic from internal sources + do you think users will find the service must trustworthy.

If anyone has had any experience of either I'd love to hear it. Also as a consumer, are you guys happy to buy from independent websites or would you feel more comfortable using services such as iTunes?

ecommerce,Anyone use ShipStation?,"I am currently migrating to shipstation and wanted to know what are some good workflows from starting with the printing orders to pick, to finally printing the shipping labels. 

This is what my process looks like right now:

1. In Shopify: 
I go to orders, and print the orders in bulk starting from the oldest order that has not yet been printed. I keep track of this information by looking at email notifications and moving the order notifications that I have printed, to a folder in gmail. (this is not the best process and that's why I am looking to print orders from shipstation)

I print 2 invoices, one that we use for picking from our warehouse and 1 that will be included in the box for the customer. (I'm not sure how to do this in shipstation... I've seen pick list, but it wont print a separate pick list per order if I do a bulk print)

Next, we pick the products and bag them up in the warehouse using one of the printed invoices, then bring it to our packing room where we will pack the orders and set them aside to have our labels printed from shipstation.

This works for now, however I would like to move this entire process to shipstation, but am not sure how. Any advice on a workflow? 

Even if you don't use shipstation, I would love to hear your process for fulfilling orders anyway.",6.0,2,2014-05-31,ECOM,0.03110995888710022,0.9366130232810974,0.03227699175477028
