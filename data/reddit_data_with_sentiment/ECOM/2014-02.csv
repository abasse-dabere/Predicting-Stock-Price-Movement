dropship,Question about packaging,"Hey guys, This might be in the wrong subreddit, but I know a lot of you ship products from a store, and have dealt with similar issues, so I apologize if this needs to be put somewhere else. 

I was wondering what people here would think if they ordered a bulk cosmetic powder, and they received it in a sealed HDPE plastic tub, white, with no bag or anything around the powder? The container is similar to a yogurt container, and would have a heat shrink band around the top, so just imagine if you received a yogurt tub with powder in it, that's the best way I can describe it. The plastic is non-toxic obviously since they package food this way, and the powder is also obviously non-ingestible. My wife says she wouldn't like it, but I just don't see an issue...

Would you feel more comfortable if it was in a plastic bag, which was heat sealed? How have you guys received powders in the past?

I am trying to figure out how to get this powder into a bag, then heat seal it without making a huge mess, and in a short amount of time. What would you use as a bag to fit in a round tub? I can't seem to find a solution on ULINE, or anywhere for my needs.

I guess I'm not understanding how to build a contraption which can fill the bags I have, [which come from a roll like this](http://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-1143/Poly-Tubing/4-x-1500-4-Mil-Poly-Tubing-Roll?pricode=WU327&amp;gadtype=pla&amp;id=47379821842&amp;gclid=COKmj5aPqrwCFdFffgodJ3sAMA&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds). I want to have a setup which will allow me to fill them up quickly, and cleanly. I thought about situating a heat sealer underneath my roll, on a wall or what have you, then pull the roll UP, so that the seal will always be on the bottom. I am pretty clumsy, and I am looking to set up something a little easier than this. Any ideas?",3,2,2014-02-01,ECOM,0.052460357546806335,0.9106433391571045,0.03689625859260559

ecommerce,Just tweaked our site in preparation for launching our first adwords campaigns-- mind providing some feedback?,"We're all about free PR, partnerships, social media, content marketing, SEO, and all that good stuff, but after reading a couple threads on here about people being wildly successful with using adwords to send traffic to their sites, I decided to hire someone to create and manage our adwords account and give it a go.

Up until now, our website wasn't converting very well.  I believe this was a problem of not having a clear message, not sending much targeted traffic to the site, and not A/B testing things.  Well, I spent the last few days cleaning up the site to make it load faster and also have a cleaner, clearer look, and added some content.  

Hopefully my changes will give it a slightly better conversion rate so our adwords campaign has the best chance at success, but I was hoping you guys could take a look at the site and provide any last minute suggestions or tips on how to tweak the site to hopefully put us on a good path towards attaining a profitable adwords campaign.

Our biggest issue is that we sell to college students directly, and often times there is a different shipping and billing addresses. We've made a lot of changes since to prevent fraud issues going forward, like improved security and knowing what to look for to spot fraudulent orders. 

I still find myself verifying every single order before shipping. I'm looking for a way to reach the person that is listed as the billing address and manually verify any orders that look fraudulent. 

Does anyone know of a good service or have solutions to this?",10,5,2014-02-04,ECOM,0.06443978101015091,0.8699737787246704,0.06558647751808167
dropship,Ecommerce Automation (xpost from /r/Magento),"Hey all, I wanted to share with you my ecommerce automation experiences... hopefully this can help other people also.

A while back my software consulting group decided that we should to create several ecommerce stores. Over time we've automated many parts of the business using our custom tools that we've built in-house.

We've realized that other ecommerce site owners/dropshippers have very similar issues as what we've faced so last month we decided to start offer this tool, which is called Spark Shipping (http://sparkshipping.com/), to other site owners. The public facing product is relativity new but we already have several sites automating parts of their business using Spark Shipping and we've been receiving great feedback so I wanted to mention it here.

One way Spark Shipping helps dropshippers is by automatically sending out fulfilment requests. When a new order comes in, we determine what vendor, distributor, supplier, or fulfillment center the order should be fulfilled with then send out the appropriate emails. As most dropshippers know, this is a huge pain to do by hand and prone for errors.

Also, we assist site owners with pricing their products, especially in the cases where you would like to offer free or a set shipping price. After products are loaded into Spark Shipping we start with the weight and dimensions of each product. Next we determine where the order is shipped from (your warehouse, vendor, third party fulfilment, etc.) and help you determine what is the furthest (highest cost) location that you'll be sending this product to. We'll also connect to UPS and get a realtime shipping quote. If you have negotiated rates with UPS  we'll also take those into account.

We also know what markets you are selling to and the costs to sell into these markets. For example you may have a 2.5% credit card fee when selling directly on your own site but a 15% commission when selling via Amazon Seller Central. After all these factors are taken into account we provide you with a breakeven price for each product in each market. Also, we'll provide you a suggested price that factors in a desired margin (also set by you). This allows you to let anyone in your organization quickly lookup a product and determine both what is the price you would like to sell it for and what is the lowest price you can sell it for without loosing money.

Having said all of this, we would love if anyone here thinks Spark Shipping would be helpful and would like to give it a try. Also, any feedback that you have is always highly appreciated. We offer a 30 trial that is totally free, if the site does not provide you with enough value just cancel and you won't be charged. http://sparkshipping.com/

We're rolling out new features and improving the product nonstop right now. If there any automation that you have but the product does not do it right now give me a shout and I'll see if we can help (charles [at] SparkShipping [dot] com).

Thanks a lot!

ecommerce,Where to start? In over my head.,"I'm the sole IT manager at a manufacturing company that mostly makes customized products.  I've been tasked with looking into creating an ecommerce presence to sell non-configured items (wholesale items).  My problem is that I'm in way over my head and not really sure where to start.

Currently the majority of our orders come into us via fax.  We use an ERP system to manage all aspects of order entry, inventory, production and accounting.  We have several different price lists based on customers.

This ecommerce project would be B2B only which basically means we'll need to maintain all the client account information ourselves and will need to ensure the proper customer gets the correct price on the website.

My current thought is that the only real option is to purchase the B2B portal offered by our ERP vendor, but am concerned about the security and hardware overhead needed to host websales from our server room.  I'd very much prefer to use some sort of hosted/cloud solution, but the thought of trying to maintain customer accounts, pricing and inventory outside of our ERP system and still keep both in sync just seems like a nightmare waiting to happen.

Am I way off base with these thoughts?  Could there be a better solution than our ERP vendors?

Would a wise investment be trying to find a consultant to discuss everything with?  I'm open to suggestions at this point.",3,2,2014-02-04,ECOM,0.04082173854112625,0.9282802939414978,0.030897991731762886

dropship,I'm probably missing something - Payment Processing Delays and Paying the Manufacturer,"So my predicament isn't all that complicated but I can't figure out a good solution and am wondering if any experienced drop shippers here can help out.

I run a store that sells items for around $400 each and I sell between 3 and 4 a month right now just off of letting the site sit online - no actual promotions on my end.

The manufacturer of course takes a good chunk of this (~$310) leaving me with 90 dollars or so per sale minus any promotion I may throw into the mix.

I currently use Shopify and their Stripe integration and that takes about 3 days to process and hit my account. 

Since I am always concerned that shipping delays may bother customers, I IMMEDIATELY place the orders with my manufacturer before the money ever hits my account. Of course to do this though I must pay them. This means that for every order I receive, I have to front $310 to the manufacturer and wait 3 days to get that money back (from Shopify's processing) in my account. 

This is the main reason why I may just give up on Dropshipping - I feel like it's actually a risk to promote the site because I don't have thousands of dollars to front to the manufacturer if my site takes off one day. I'd be screwed! 

So what do you guys do to fix this scenario?

- Lines of Credit?
- Wait to place the manufacturer order until payment is processed?
- Do you just have that much money in the business' account for this?

This is to me the single hardest part of dropshipping higher ticket items - paying for them when the processing is delayed. Thanks in advance!",6,5,2014-02-05,ECOM,0.15789976716041565,0.8188079595565796,0.023292329162359238

dropship,Please help me getting started dropshipping from Amazon/Ebay,"I have an eBay and Paypal account, they both are almost two years old. I have never sold anything on eBay but I have bought many items there. 
I also have an Amazon account. I have sold some few items in there and I have bought a lot. My Amazon account is like 2 years old.

Anyway, I would like to drop ship by listing an item on eBay (without having it), then wait for a buyer to buy such item, buy the item myself from Amazon.com for a cheaper price than the one I listed on eBay (hopefully a big difference in price so I can make a little profit), and then select to send it as a ""gift"" to the seller via Amazon.

Since I have never sold anything on eBay, I want to drop ship only one item at a time every week or so so Paypal won't give me too many restrictions; I want to start drop shipping very slowly.

I do have some questions, could anyone help me? 

When listing the item I want to sell on eBay, is it fine if I use the same picture and the same description from Amazon and use it on eBay? If not, what could be the best ""copyright"" free alternative to list the item? I could make the description in my own words, but what about the picture? I suppose all pictures on the Internet from the products I want to list on eBay will be copyrighted.

When Amazon sends the item to the seller, I know it will be in an Amazon box, and that if I select to send it as a ""gift"" then the receipt won't be included, but how will the tracking information appear to the seller when I give him the tracking number and he looks it up online? Will it show that it was sent by Amazon?

Those are my only two questions. I know I could get my account banned from eBay for drop shipping but I am willing to take the risk. However, I have read that a lot of people have been doing this FOR YEARS and they still keep selling on eBay. So I hope to have some luck.

ecommerce,Custom content uploader for Volusion framework,"New to this subreddit, so sorry if this is not the right place for this question...

My company is using the Volusion system for a print company. We produce custom images with customer generated content. We need the capability to allow our customers to upload their files (sometimes up to 1GB), select the product associated with the upload, then place the order. On the backend I want the order management system to provide me a link or reference of some kind to the location of the upload (either a dropbox hosted server, or a local server) so I can download the file and process the order. After the order is placed each and every product is put together by hand in our own software so we need to be able to differentiate uploads between product selections. For example, if a customer orders multiple products each with different content I need to be able to see which file goes with which product.

Does anyone in the subreddit have any input on how this can be achieved? I have been googling this all day with limited success.

My company is building a product that ties into commerce platforms. We need a large-ish catalog that has pretty product images and realistic price, metadata, and so on to use for demonstration of our product. 

Can anyone recommend something?  

For example, I know that Oracle does demonstrations of atg/endeca with a catalog they call Spaces which is, I think, based on the Sur La Table catalog (surlatable.com).  It's a nice looking demo.  I'm sure Oracle is paying a lot for this - I'm wondering if there's a catalog wrapped up as a CSV with a zip of images that a small company could use to prove out/demo a solution that would be equally compelling content-wise. 

Here's a demo of Spaces ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rprUuCWBn8c

ecommerce,Which eCommerce solution is best for a current eCommerce owner looking to switch platforms. Read on for details...,"Hi!  This is my first post on Reddit and I need some expert advice on which eCommerce solution is best for me to switch to.

I have read through many posts about open source solutions I am considering - Magento, osCommerce and Drupal Commerce.  I also saw many comments on Shopify, OpenCart and WooCommerce.  I could not decide which is best for my scenario so I'm reaching out to you!

My current eCommerce site is 1 year old and built on nopCommerce.  It was a free theme that was customized by a web developer.  It is incredibly slow (2.6 load times).  I had to turn off many critical features to try to get it to run faster with no results.  The checkout constantly has errors.  The shipping APIs are not configured correctly.  I'm losing business because of all these reasons, and quite honestly I'm tired of the boring layout.  So I'm ready to dump nopCommerce and fast!

I was thinking of buying a template from ThemeForest for Magento and seeing what I could do myself.  But I'm afraid I'll run into the same slowness issues that others have commented Magento has and don't want to waste time or money.  Drupal seems to run faster as I understand.  I just don’t understand caching and what to compare between platforms.  Speaking of, I have no money left to hire a developer.  I can make changes to html5, css, and design graphics and I can perform changes in my hosting.  I am not a complete noob - rather - have enough knowledge to be dangerous and Google for tutorials always.

Here's the nitty - my website sells paper products directly to consumers.  I have over 500 products and 20,000 images with an average 1000x1000 pixels (optimized).  The nature of my store requires the product photo to be zoomed in on for details. It also requires filters to narrow down many product attributes.  The SEO is done well (I did it) and it's generating results (but no sales since the checkout was not working properly for months...grr).  My site seems to get an average of 60-100 lookers a day and not many sales because of all the bugs.  By the way I sell in USA and Canada.

So what do you think is the best platform for me? I prefer open source so I can grow.  I also want to be able to easily replicate all the hard SEO work I did (canonical URLs, taxonomy, etc.).

Looking forward to your advice!",33,10,2014-02-12,ECOM,0.033713266253471375,0.9267016649246216,0.039585135877132416

dropship,My dropshiping journey journal. 2/14 - It begins,"I have already posted this in /r/entrepreneur http://redd.it/1xu808 but after finding this subreddit decided would be a great place to get additional feedback

Have decided to try my hand in dropshipping. After reading all about it in Time Ferriss' lifestyle design bible Four Hour Work Week I began researching it this morning.
My goals are to * Bootstrap and sweat equity my operations * Learn as much as I can on sales, marketing and SEO * Make some money
My first steps have been to sign up to Doba's (a dropship service - https://www.doba.com ) 7 day trial. The plan is to first use eBay to sell the products with the requirement testing to see if I can make profit after Doda's monthly fee of $59.99.

Therefore if I hit $50 profit this week will write it down as a success.

Putting this on Reddit because after feedback and tips on dropshipping, SEO, ebay selling and anything else which can help me

ecommerce,"I make items and sell them across a variety of online stores. I'm looking for a good iPad app to update and keep track of all my items, inventory, sales, sites, prices, customers etc..","Hi!
I make a bunch of hand made stuff, t-shirts, jewellery, sculpture, art, and sell it on various online stores like Etsy, Redbubble, eBay, Facebook, etc..

I need an iPad app to keep track of all that.

Ideally it would have:

- Item database, with image, details of materials used, suggested prices, time it took to make, etc

-inventory management, how many I have in stock of each kind

- store tracker, which stores I have listed them on, urls, price , time left on sale etc.

- sales, how many, what store, how much, who to, etc

-notes/, I could keep a record of useful user feedback

-item requests , items that people have ordered that I need to make, or items people would like to see on the store.

I've been looking through ipad inventory and database apps all day, as well as home inventory, point of sales and all other kinds, I have a couple of apps that do some of the features, but nothing decent yet.


The ability to up load an items details straight to various stores would be awesome but I'm hardly expecting that :p


It's only on a fairly small scale, so something that does the job and nothing more, I don't need barcodes and tax calculation etc..

If anyone knows or uses something suitable...

Thanks peeps. :)

The plan is to now research niche markets, test them on eBay and then launch a online store if the test is a success.

From Reddit /r/dropship is there any suggested niche markets? Anyone had great success with a certain market?

ecommerce,platform/payment processor for selling festival tickets,"I'm involved with a local non-profit annual music event in town, and for the last few years they've contracted out their ticket sales to a third party in town that they work with, but the fees consist of the ~3% CC charge being passed on to them as well as pretty hefty labour cost ($3k+).    
    
    
    

They have a self-hosted WP page, and are open to whatever suggestion is best.  They've floated the idea of various WP plugins for payments, but I'm not familiar with them myself.  They'd ideally like to collect email address (opt-in) for future mailing lists.  
I've told them to be weary of PCI regulations and to stay away from storing or any CC data themselves to avoid all of the hassles involved with that.
I've suggested shopify, since that seems like their easiest option.  It'd need to be tied into something that issues/generates the sequential/numbered tickets (&lt;3000 total) to be picked up the day of the event using the email they received after payment (QR Codes as well?)

I was wondering if /r/ecommerce had any suggestions on how what would be a secure solution for them, of if anyone has done this in the past.  It's a pretty small operation so they don't have any tech people themselves but I offer some general IT help on a pro bono basis.

They'd also need to be able to accept ticket sales in person at their shop as well as possibly in the next town over using either a tablet or smartphone at each location (festival-owned device)

ecommerce,Inventory Management Software and eCommerce Ideas,"Hi all! I'm wondering if I could get some advice.

My organization currently uses ATG Commerce but we have no inventory management software for the eCommerce team to use as a central repository for images, skus/pricing (current and historical), inventory reporting, etc. 

Additionally, all of the templates for changes we make within the ATG CMS (Business Control Center) are generated through a home-grown CMS that plugs into a bunch of tables in phpMyAdmin - this was a custom-built solution by someone who no longer works here. Ah, the dangers of custom-built solutions...

Basically, I'm wondering if there are any suggestions you may have for the following:

dropship,Drop-Shipping from Overstock/Wayfiar?,"I have been working closely with a manufacturer for a few years here in Arizona in the pet industry, they offer drop-shipping themselves but they also sell to Overstock and Wayfair who sell the items for much less because of the shipping costs they get from UPS are much lower. 

Anyway, my plan is to drop-ship these items on a website as well as Amazon and eBay. When I receive an order from my site or eBay my plan is to then turnaround and order form Overstock or Wayfair, pay for the item myself but have it fulfilled by Overstock of Wayfair. 

Does anyone know if they specifically disallow drop-shipping? Has anyone had luck in the past with this method of drop-shipping?

We put our CPC max at the recommended amount for each keyword, but even so, we're getting only a half-dozen impressions a day. The Adwords impressions estimator said that our tags should result in 2000+ impressions per day.

We'll be using WordPress with a woocommerce shop theme; I'm currently re-developing an ecommerce site (uses woocommerce) so I have some general knowledge about all the additional coding that may be needed).

That being said, I have a lot of general questions about running an ecommerce site, so a lot of the questions will bounce around from topic to topic. Any help and suggestions, especially from personal experience, as very welcomed.

1) HOSTING - What should I look for in terms of hosting? I looked around several subreddits to see what people used. We'll have 100-200 products initially at launch. I don't think I'd need a VPN, what about shared hosting? What do I have to be aware about when looking for hosting for an ecommerce site? I also need PCI compliant hosting, right? Is that an addon or is that something I make sure the hosting company has/sells/offers?

2) SSL CERT - How do I obtain this? Is it better to buy it myself or go through a hosting provider that has/sells/provides them? How does it work? I was thinking of accepting all major credit cards (let's say for now only shipping to US), are there other online payment methods I should allow?

3) INVENTORY/FINANCES - Is there any inventory management software I could use to easily track the inventory? What about finances? I'd really love to have all this stuff neatly detailed.

4) ADVERTISING/MARKETING - Is PPC the best way to advertise initially? If not, what kind of advertising should I look into? About marketing, where to do I start? Email marketing?

5) Security - What's the best way to make sure my site is secure. Plugins? Anything else I should make sure to do? (Make sure to have strong passwords?)

6) Shipping - Suggestions for shipping methods/carriers?

7) SEO - What should I make sure to do SEO-wise? Should I get Yoast SEO plugin and use that? Another plugin? What are some tried and true methods?

We use Channel Advisor to list our products on these marketplaces and bring orders back into our in-house order management system automatically.  It works well.  

However, we're a ""product manufacturer"" and there are a ton of smaller sites out there that aggregate products similar to ours and sell them.  We would like to get involved with these guys, but it's just not possible - they all want to take the order, then send us a .pdf of the shipping label and have us drop-ship the product.  We're fine with the drop-shipping, but it's the manual part that is painful.  We can't fit that process manual process into our automated system.

I want to set up a shop where customer can choose from a range o products.

To every meal he can choose to buy or not to buy drink and he can choose from wide range of drinks.

When the restaurant runs out of raw ingredient, let say milk, than every meal that uses milk as an ingredient is out of stock.

ecommerce,Whats a good web strategy for expanding eCommerce sites into international &amp; wholesale markets? Multiple sites? Multiple stores within one platform?,"I'm an intermediate level dev/designer doing an ecommerce store for a business that manufactures, sells, and distributes all its products from a single US warehouse.  They want to pursue selling in foreign markets, first in Canada.  However, selling and shipping to individual customers in CA from the US comes with excessive shipping costs and taxes/duties for our customers. So, we have the thought to supply a distributor with a bulk stock that they can in-turn sell from as separate inventory represented by a different online store.

What does /r/ecommerce think are some other effective ways of handling this?  Are separate sites a good idea?  Is there one platform to control multiple sites?",0,2,2014-02-27,ECOM,0.026844173669815063,0.9360235929489136,0.037132181227207184

ecommerce,Shopping in the digital age and ZMOT,"Smart devices and their allies are heralding a wave if changes in shopping by allowing the potential buyers to understand the brand or product thoroughly before stepping into a store (brick and mortar or online). Traditionally, a consumer would stroll into a store, experience the product first-hand or based on the recommendations of the salesperson and purchase the product. Today, this trend is preceded by an extensive online research that may include reading articles, user reviews or blogs and much more. This trend of the conscious and savvy consumer engaging in pre-shopping has been termed as the Zero Moment of Truth or the ZMOT, by Google.
 
Let us understand the concept of ZMOT and contemplate its importance for businesses, as it has been proven to serve as an important ROI metric. The traditional marketing approach has been categorized under three phases, namely:
 
- The stimulus (An advertising of any form)
- First moment of truth (When the buyer actually makes a decision to purchase the product)
- Second moment of truth (The actual customer experience of the product)
 
Introduce a phase between the stimulus and the First moment of truth, where a consumer grabs the laptop, mobile phone or some other wired device and starts learning about a product/ service he/she is thinking about trying/ buying, and that is exactly what Zero moment of truth turns out to be.
 
This automatically leads to the question- ‘How can businesses succeed with ZMOT?’
 
Consumers today are fickle and highly demanding. With this changing behavior in shopping, consumers no longer feel the need to remain loyal to a brand and switch to others quickly if their needs are not satiated by one brand. As a result, businesses cannot afford to ignore consumers and least of all leave them dissatisfied.
 
We have identified four areas that businesses need to work on to ensure a satisfied and loyal consumer:
 
Understanding the buyer – To understand a consumer’s needs and research preferences, businesses need to track and analyze huge volumes of data. This can be achieved by anchoring targeted campaigns that can be measured. With customer predictive analytics coming handy, an encyclopaedia of customer shopping behavior and buying patterns can be traced.
 
Keeping your content relevant – Content is the king of ZMOT. It has to be easily available across all forms of media of communication. This information should be available to not only customers but also for the companies, enabling them to develop relevant offerings. It not only has to be relevant but it also has to be available at the right time.
 
Search as an important tool – At the heart of ZMOT, lies the search feature and plays an important role by leading the customer to the right information. To do this effectively, businesses must produce relevant page titles, adding related keywords and Meta tags to their website.
 
Follow a multi-device approach – businesses should be able to deliver the same shopping experience in store and across other channels. Under such demanding conditions, businesses have no choice but to cater to the needs of consumers and provide customized options as much as possible. Only such a mindset can convert curious shoppers into buyers.
