shopify,You never know when you're going to get your big break..,"I'll keep this short:

I started [Scorpia Prints](https://www.scorpiaprints.com/) a few months ago and sales have been slow. I was even thinking of giving up a few days ago because I have a lot going on in my life right now. You know the usual voices in your head that keep telling you to give up, keep telling you that your idea is stupid etc. Well I was feeling pretty down.

And then all of a sudden, this Saturday evening, my website and a poster I created was [featured on the front page](http://www.sportbible.com/football/exclusives-news-the-evolution-of-football-boots-poster-is-a-pure-nostalgia-trip-20190629) of a huge sports site in the UK. This drove a lot of traffic to my website and sales were good.

How did I get this break? Well, about a month back I had cold emailed 150+ journalists about my posters, and only about 1-2 responded. I thought they'd forget about my website but apparently not -- they covered it!

Moral of the story: You never know when your hardwork will pay off. I haven't done anything substantial yet, and this is a very little event, but for me, it's progress. It's going to keep me going for now :)",31,73,2019-07-01,ECOM,0.05183607339859009,0.919978141784668,0.0281857680529356
dropship,I built a tool for r/dropship that finds profitable products on Aliexpress by order growth + profit margin!,"I created a platform called DropshipScan which scrapes thousands of products every day from Aliexpress and uses this data to rank them based on order growth over time, and of course you can test it for free: [Dropshipscan.com](https://dropshipscan.com/) 

On AliExpress you can sort products by the amount of orders, but this isn't a good indicator for how popular this products are at the moment. **What you really want to look at is, how much the order volume changed in the last couple of days and weeks**.

And thats exactly what you can do with my new tool. But it gets better, it also estimates the profit margin you can expect for every product by using the official APIs of the big e-commerce platforms. Using the descriptions and keywords of the products from Aliexpress it searches for similar listings and gets the retail prices of them. It always uses a weighted average to have the most realistic estimation and to not rely on outliers.

With this unique ranking method of order growth AND the estimated profit margins it can help you to be miles ahead of the competition and to stop wasting time with products that don't sell or don't make much profit at all. For example you can set a minimum profit margin, sort by order growth descending and search with keywords from your niche to get exactly the products you need to make money!

And of course you can add the results to a watchlist and export them as a CSV with all titles, prices, pictures etc. to use them with Shopify or Woocommerce.

dropship,HOW TO FIND A HIGH CONVERTING PRODUCT QUICK AND EASY!,"Like Minded Chimps! 

What’s up digital apes Brian Boss here taking some time right now humbled to hopefully tweak your perspective and give you some real value. 

Regardless of our journey and evolution into becoming Built On Self Success I am confident what I am about to share here right now will unlock the next phase you are in search of. 

I’m motivated to make this post and share my thoughts with you as I see so many of you asking the same thing in so many ways usually revolving for the same answer “How do you guys find a sellable product?” 

I feel like so many of you get stuck in this loaded question as a result of maybe being overwhelmed by the massive land grab available to all of us. 

Here’s the thing, I’m going to do this quick and keep things as simple as possible because it’s really not as complex as you may think it seems to be. 

Please stop looking for what sells, and start looking at what you buy. 

Seriously, you have to get in the heads of your customer and the best way to do this IMO is to apply your demographics for targeting based of how you think, what your interests are, things you spend 50 plus dollars on happily and simply just build from there. 

It’s really that easy. 

If you never bought a cell phone case, don’t sell them. If you never bought a multi color light up mask don’t sell them. 

Get in the minds of your customer and give them what they want. 

Don’t chase the money, think long term. Think brand, and have patience.  I promise if you build off what you know best (yourself) you will do great. 

Anyway just my thoughts. Thanks for reading, leave a comment below let’s talk about your obstacles and find solutions!",19,13,2019-07-02,ECOM,0.026629313826560974,0.9298418164253235,0.04352886602282524

dropship,Today I'll begin posting my journey on Dropshipping: Week 1,"**Week 1:**

A bit of backstory: I attended a party where I overheard these two guys talking about their drop shipping business. 

After some time trying to find a good niche, I stumbled upon an idea that was worth exploring. I started looking up existing sites in that same market and saw that there was little competition. Any stores that were already up didn’t seem to look too professional either. I saw this is a good/bad thing: either it was good and I would be able to establish myself in this market really well; or there was little competition because there wasn’t a profitable niche category. 

I made a free trial on Shopify and began drafting up a site, checking to see how this potential website would look. 

The site was slowly coming together: I was adding new products and trying out some apps that connected to Shopify to see how professional I could make it all look. ( I was only trying apps that were free)

I Google’d ’top online retail sites’ to take a look and see how they set up their stores. I tried to see what home page templates seemed to work, and how they categorized their products. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the rest of the first week I was working on the site after work and would try to add more products to the website. I didn’t want to offer only a few products, I wanted the website to have numerous options from each category. 

At this point I didn’t feel really confident about the website. I was still spending $0 (free trial) so this whole process was still in the exploration stage. But the more I put the website together, the more I began to think that this may be worth creating. I tried out Printful and started adding designs to the products, then I stumbled upon Oberlo and was intrigued by the low prices, so I started mixing products from these two apps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided that I was going to try to build this out. But I wanted to do the entire process running lean. Shopify was $30/month, and registering a domain was like $9/year, so I made a goal to try to launch this site and make enough money to cover these costs. I felt that if I could at least break even, then this whole process would be considered a win.",24,66,2019-07-03,ECOM,0.029623113572597504,0.9197039008140564,0.05067305266857147

If you really want to be happy and successful in life, you need self-discipline. And consistency is key. Also, the way you approach things/your mindset is very important. Always see each obstacle/problem as an opportunity to grow as a person--after overcoming them that is.

I'll also leave you guys with this amazing quote from Bertrand Russell: ""The key to happiness is to make your interests as wide as possible and let your reactions to things and people be as friendly as possible.""

But when you start processing orders your bank shuts down your card and now you are fucked till you call them and let them know what is going on because they think someone is using your card for fraud. You start getting a ton of emails from customers asking where there product is since its been well over 15 days or more. On top of all this you are working a full time job and sometimes you just do not have time for it all so you start getting cases on paypal or chargebacks. You really start to question if you can actually do this. Trust me this shit is not easy but it can be doable. Just do your research. I just wanted to share this because I know people can relate to this. Hire a VA to fulfill orders and and answer emails. I guarantee that will change everything.

shopify,Store Content Marketing - Idea/Opinions?,"Hey all,

I was wondering what you guys would think of this idea - Content as a Service. 

So, the basic idea is that I am a content marketing expert and I would like to specifically offer services to Shopify/WooCommerce stores for free.  But, when a visitor comes into the site via my content there is a small charge (under $0.50), something like Google Adwords - it is free until you get a click.   That way you only have to pay for results and the better content I produce the better it is for everyone. 

Would that make sense?  The content would all be approved by the store owner/manager and needs to be highly targeted to buying traffic, but I think it could be a win/win.  

There is also a benefit of links to the content help the site overall as well, so that is also a bonus that would be ""free"".",25,5,2019-07-04,ECOM,0.013163870200514793,0.8664213418960571,0.12041477113962173

shopify,Why doesn't Shopify let you edit an order (without an additional app)?,"I've been using Shopify for the last 3+ years and love it.  Every now and then I need to edit an order and can't, so I have googled for why this may be.  I've found a few forum threads where CS explains to the customer that they can't do that unless they install an app.  I would think this would be more hotly discussed and Shopify should be working on implementing it.  These are the reasonable business reasons for having the ability that I see:

*  Customer changes their mind about the color of the item they purchased, so I should be able to edit the order before I mark it as fulfilled. 
*  Same for size.  If a larger size costs more, of course we'd then need to charge the customer for the balance outstanding, so maybe this is the sticking point?
*  I like to put little freebies into my orders for a nice customer experience, and repeat customers get a slightly bigger/better freebie.  It makes sense to have the free items recorded in inventory (and I actually sell mine, in packs of 20, for those customers who want a batch of them).  So I would love to be able to edit the order to add the freebie, discount that item so that the order total is the same (and thus no additional payment is needed), and then fulfill the order.  That way my inventory counts for the freebies are maintained by Shopify.

I'm sure there are more.  Anybody here know the current state of this needed feature, or why Shopify won't do it?",22,9,2019-07-05,ECOM,0.029858510941267014,0.9108920693397522,0.0592493936419487

dropship,Seeing as you guys love progress posts...,"Intro: I'm a 16 year old guy from England, ive got £300 ($375 USD)  to my name, and would certainly not want to risk all of it on dropshipping.

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 weeks ago, I... guess I saw a YT ad about dropshipping. I can;t remember how I found out about it, but I think I had previously heard about it- it didn't sound new, but sounded interesting and profitable. I searched more and it looked fun and relatively easy.

I researched a ton over the following 2 weeks, finding YouTube channels such as Gabriel St Germain and Arie Scherson, being prominent.

It was then that I made a shopify store and activated the 14 day free trial. I started adding apps such as Oberlo, Product Upsell,  Volume &amp; Tiered Discounts, Loox, to name a few.

I still hadn't found a niche, but was too busy adding products I thought could maybe be profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

Shopify limits you to what you can and can't do slightly when your in your trial phase, so a few days ago I activated my shopify plan, $29.99 a month and it was then when I knew there wasn't much turning back, so I bought a domain, payed for the apps that I wanted, and payed for webmail to manage emails, as I didn't want customer services handled through my personal email, nor my personal email associated with my website.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also set up my FB ads account. Like many hobbies I join, I binge-watch as much YT content as I can get, and absorb information quickly and aggressively, and its always exciting when things come together and look like the people I'm watching do it - like making a cake, and by then end of it, it looks just like the recipe book. That;s how I felt when I made my first ad campaign and saw all the correct columns, (not with any $ figures though haha), and it gave me motivation to fill them with data and progress. I actually ran an ad today, just a quick video ad I compiled from aliexpress/youtube. I spent $0.55 on the advert, and it reached 68 people and got 1 clicked link. It's not much, but I was surprised that so little cost got a relatively large audience.

This is actually good news, as my dad was talking about advertising to me - he said that 20 years ago his friend tried setting up a business and wasted around $2000 on ads and it failed, but I explained that facebook is a massive platform with the ability to target specific topics, people, and control who sees what. He's obviously hopeful of my success, but I think he's a bit worried that someone under 18 could set up a company in their bedroom like this. I'm fairly smart though (i think), and he knows that I'm smart.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I guess we're all caught up. Currently I've got a host of different products on my store, from women's apparel, to pet accessories.

Now I know you'll probably say that I should stick to a niche, but, is it really necessary? My thought process was that I could target each collection or product separately on FB ads and my store would be like, several different niches, and customers might see the other products, but just want to shop for the products they clicked the ad for. .

actually, now I've typed this, I've made a decision to focus on a niche. It's one I've previously looked at but thought that people would most likely stick to name brands, but I think there's room for ""accessories"" or tools that wouldn't necessarily need a name brand for, and they are good as gifts for people in the ""hobby"" as well, however the products don't really solve a problem, or at most it's a very mundane problem.

ecommerce,Dropshipping in 2019,"Some tips and thoughts regarding Dropshipping in 2019:

A bit of background about myself. I am currently staying fulltime at Shenzhen China, have been doing this for over 5 years, launched a dozen or so dropshipping sites surpassing 7 figure annual revenue. 

1. What type of site should you build?

In most cases, I would recommend building a store with few SKU's and focus on them. Gone are the days where you'd test 200 SKU's with 5$ ads each. About a year or two ago, we'd have a 15% breakeven chance by testing hundreds of products a week, that's with a somewhat ok lander + video ads, but now that number is less than 5%. Spending time optimizing your website/funnel and ads is I believe more profitable than blindly testing products. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Invest in good copywriting. 

This seems pretty obvious, but few are doing it to maximize it's potential. You should AB test by yourself or preferably test with multiple freelancers. We have on average 4 angles we focus on for each store (that generally only focuses on 1-2 product), each with 5 variations of copies. It's a rather slow and costly process but much more profitable than spending that money blindly on ads. Ideally, you would want to integrate good copywriters to your product selection process, as they are the ones most directly affecting the success rate of a certain product. I almost hire exclusively on upwork, some of which I have hired permanently to work at my office.  Also... videos are essential, if you don't have people to create videos. I would suggest taking a look at animoto. Bottom line is, it's much easier to have profitable ads by optimizing your creatives/landers than tweaking your ads platform (FB/Google).

&amp;#x200B;

3. Where to dropship from. 

Now, this is a tricky question. I don't see a problem using Aliexpress to start out since it has the most competitive prices and the largest selection, but I see the doubts you may have, quality and shipping. The quality issue is for me a non-issue, you get what you pay, if you are scraping the cheapest products, then sure chances are you'll receive a crappy product, same goes with shipping. On the other hand, Chinese dropshippers don't really use Aliexpress, they use 1688/Taobao/T-mall.  I would recommend getting your hands on 1688 (Yes it's not easy for foreigners, but that's how you gain an edge), there will be an MOQ but not too much.  Also, they don't use epacket. You should know that shipping time is the single most influential thing to your FB page score. Most here use what's called a ""special/dedicated line"", it's not that much expensive than e-packet and you'd get products shipped to the US in 6 natural days on average. 

Now if you want to scale, eventually you'd need to have a fulfillment partner. There are hundreds of them in Shenzhen and lot's of details you should keep an eye on, but generally speaking, one element is largely overlooked, that is, local shipping prices, which actually is super important since it adds up to your costs. Every single fulfillment center will tell you that they have the best prices, but that is absolutely not the case at all. The only way you'd get better prices is with volume, so you need to compare carefully. You should also negotiate with your fulfillment partner to see whether they can process your order in less than X hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Make sure you hide your site from Spy tools. 

The Chinese are just catching up to the whole dropshipping game and they are good at it. Check your Google analytics and see whether you have traffic coming from commerce inspector etc.... You can insert 2\~3 lines of code to your store )if you're using shopify) and avoid a large percentage of spy tools. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. UPSELL UPSELL UPSELL 

Regardless of what my store sells, I always import hundreds of products to my store . I do not display them anywhere on my store, they only show up when people have purchased, just before the thank you page. You will likely not be profitable if you do not have an up/downsell funnel. There are plenty of tools that can help you achieve this.

&amp;#x200B;

\-So it would start off with me deciding to get an E-Commerce website going with Shopify or Woo-Commerce.   
\-I then need to find some products to sell. Let's just say for this questions sake I choose to use AliExpress. 

\-I would go onto their website, find some products that I think would sell well and import them onto my personal E-Commerce website.  

\-Lets say I imported a shoe that was $5.99 on AliExpress with $4.99 e-packet shipping to all areas. I then list this shoe on my personal website for $40.99 with free shipping world-wide. 

\-A wild customer appears and purchases these shoes from my website for $40.99. The $5.99 price of the shoe, as well as the $4.99 price of shipping are subtracted from the total amount. Leaving me with $30.01 profit.

\-I sell 100 pairs of shoes and will have made over $3000 without having to have inventory or shipping or anything figured out? I understand there is a lot of marketing costs but the actual business side of things seems too easy...

ecommerce,Are Banks Committing Credit Card Fraud When They Initiate Chargebacks Without Verifying with Cardholder First?,"I must admit upfront that we've only received a handful of chargebacks, but 66% of them have been fraudulent chargebacks. What I mean is the customer's financial institution initiates a chargeback without the cardholder even knowing. Then when I finally manage to reach the customer to inquire about the chargeback they tell me they placed the order, received it and are happy. They had no idea their bank initiated the charge back. This is the case with 66% of our chargebacks. If the bank is deciding to initiate a chargeback that is them essentially claiming, by themselves without even checking with the cardholder first, that the order was fraud. 

If I file a false claim with my insurance company it's considered insurance fraud. Why us this not considered fraud by the bank? If I had not got the customer to call their bank I would almost certainly have lost the case and my money. And the bank or CC company, who initiated this on their own, would also charge me an additional $15 chargeback fee. Who is this not fraud by the bank? They file the claim and then they also decide the case when I challenge it. It's like they're the plaintive and the judge. Banks shouldn't be able to initiate a chargeback on their own without first checking with the cardholder.",21,14,2019-07-08,ECOM,0.12715640664100647,0.8519017100334167,0.020941875874996185

So a friend and I are going to start selling crystals (jewelry,gems,etc.) on shopify and use instagram as our advertising platform. I wrote down a few questions I had that I'd love to get some insight on.

* Should I worry about getting an LLC or some type of corp. before we start?
* How many different products should we have when we start our website?
* Should we give away free ""samples"" to micro influencers?
* Should we buy an initial 1k or so followers to make our page look more legit?
* In your experience, is it better to double down on influencers or ads on instagram? Or are both necessary?
* We are reselling from aliexpress (not dropshipping)(at least for now), I've notice that some products are sold undera brand. Can we (legally) resell those items under our brand name? Or just some clarity on this whole reselling legality aspect would be nice.
* Should our product pictures be against a white background or keep it more casual?
* Can we write copy about crystals relieving you of negative energy or charging your chakras and whatnot? What is the rule when it comes to making claims about your product if you're not entirely sure its true?

In 2019 I think it is known without being said that the “digital entrepreneur” is the most oversaturated sought after title. Everybody wants to be a successful CEO and have some mega-corp and be able to fund everything you want to do with your life, I get it, I understand the dream, mine isnt far off from that either.

Heres the issue though that 99% of us run into and that the “guru’s” don’t want you to ever realize. All of that stuff I said above? It’s a pipe dream. The Guru’s are doing so well because their business model is to first sell you a dream (usually the one I just described above) with cars, expensive clothes, giant mansions, etc. And then to second sell you on the “follow my roadmap and it’ll get you all of that stuff”. And although I don’t necessarily like gurus, I’m not saying that I think they’re all con artists. Some of them are selling you advice that worked for them 3 years ago, 2 years ago, 1 year ago, things have changed since then though! Even the ones that are selling you advice that is working for them RIGHT NOW, it may not work for you even if you have a super similar business but you just have a slightly different personality than them.

The truth about the gurus is that unless they are able to look at every single aspect of your business, your expenses, your daily routine, how YOU’RE feeling, how desperate you are for new business, how your internet is, what kind of computer your using, etc. ALL OF THE SMALL DETAILS, they make a difference to the roadmap they are selling.

What you need to do is take a moment away from all the noise, the advice, the ads, the youtube videos, take some time to step back, give your brain a reset, and think for yourself for a little bit to figure out what would work best for you! Use creativity, the truth behind business is that it’s actually all super transparent and obvious. The things that work are the things that you look at and say “theres no way, that makes TOO much sense for it to work”

I might just be on a rant because I’m tired of all the gurus that have popped up and are scamming people for common sense, but seriously you’re the people making them rich for the common sense, you’ve gotta think for yourself.",69,121,2019-07-09,ECOM,0.03381549194455147,0.9316381812095642,0.0345463864505291

ecommerce,Question about handling orders that are flagged as possibly fraudulent,"I just got an order that got flagged as being fraudulent because the customer indicated that their billing address was the same as the shipping address when it actually wasn't.

I couldn't enter her billing address into the order to unflag it as a fraud risk.  Her order went through even with the flag so I can fulfill it, but it seems like I should be able to remove the fraud flag.

A more pointed question:  What is the point of asking for the customer's correct billing address if I can't put it into the order and bounce it against the fraud checker again?  I have no way of knowing if the address she gave me is in fact correct.  All I can do is trust her.

shopify,How to Track the Source of Installs in Your Shopify App Store Listing,"At some point after launching your app on the Shopify app store, you and every app developer will try to make sense of the traffic to your app listing. Is the Facebook campaign you’re testing out bringing merchants to your page? What about the handful of blog posts you’ve written over the past few months?

Trying to answer these questions is a great first step to better understand your marketing efforts and help inform where you should spend more time, or when it’s time to move on to something else. For these reasons and more, setting up Google Analytics on your app listing is a must ([and it’s super easy to do](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/app-store/being-successful-in-the-app-store/marketing-internally/tracking-with-google-analytics)).

But how about getting insights on what marketing channels are actually driving merchants to click on your \[Add app\] button? That’s way better. And for a long time, we didn’t have this configured properly for either of our Shopify Apps: [Rewind Backups](https://apps.shopify.com/backup) and [Replay Store Copy](https://apps.shopify.com/store-copy).

## Google Analytics Setup

Before you can begin tracking the source of installs on your Shopify app listing, you need to track traffic and page views with Google Analytics (GA). If you’ve already connected your GA account to your app listing, jump ahead to ""**Tracking \[Add App\] Clicks""** below.

If you haven’t already connected GA to your Shopify app listing, this section is for you – and so is this article: [How to set up Google Analytics for your Shopify app listing](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/app-store/being-successful-in-the-app-store/marketing-internally/tracking-with-google-analytics).

If you have GA on your website, you should create a separate property for your app listing.

Your app listing sits on a different domain and by keeping it in a separate GA property, you will get a clearer view of what visitors do within the different areas under your online umbrella. You can take a look at some [example account structures](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1102152?hl=en) to get a better understanding of how to set up your GA properties.

To create a new property, log in to your GA account and click the gear icon in the bottom left of the screen to load up the admin panel. Above the Property column in the middle, you will see a blue button to \[+ Create Property\].

**📷**

Because Rewind is available for more apps than just Shopify, (including [Klaviyo backups](https://rewind.io/klaviyo/), [QuickBooks Online backups](https://rewind.io/backup/quickbooks-online/), and [Mailchimp backups](https://rewind.io/backup/mailchimp/)) we have a number of GA properties in our GA account.

When you create a new property, it will be assigned a new tracking ID that is slightly different than the ID of your account. For example, the Rewind website ID is something like 18988-1 while the Rewind Shopify app listing is 18988-5 because it’s the 5th property in our account.

Whatever setup you end up choosing for your Shopify app listing, head to your GA admin page, click on “&lt;&gt; Tracking Info” in the middle column and then the “Tracking Code” option from the drop-down to get your specific GA Tracking ID. Copy it or write it down.

**📷**

## Adding Google Analytics to your Shopify App Listing

This part is really easy. With your GA Tracking ID in hand, head over to your [Shopify Partners dashboard](https://www.shopify.com/partners) and click through to edit your app listing.

Scroll down to section E and paste your GA ID in the first box, labelled “Tracking ID”:

📷

Great success! Within 24 hours (probably faster), you’ll start to see visitor information populate within your Google Analytics dashboard.

## Tracking [Add App] Clicks

With Google Analytics up and running on your app listing, you’re on to the next step – one that I’ve found many app developers haven’t taken.

Shopify actually inserts an event for clicks on the \[Add app\] button in your app listing, and your GA account can read that event.

Check it out below – I used Google Chrome to right-click the button on one of our app listings and hit ‘Inspect’. Do the same and you’ll see the following for your app:

📷

You’ll want to pay particular attention to what’s listed in the code after “event”, specifically: “Shopify App Store”, “Get App button”, and “AppName” where AppName is your app. Write this down.

Head back to your GA admin panel and click on “Goals” in the View column on the right.

📷

Click the big red \[+NEW GOAL\] button up top to get started.

📷

Step 1 – Goal Setup, choose the ‘Sign Up’ goal template.

📷

Step 2 – Goal Destination, name the goal whatever you like, ideally something memorable. I use “Clicked ‘Add App’ Button (AppName)”.

Under the Type label, choose “Event”

📷

Step 3 – Goal details, this brings you to where you will enter the details we saw when we inspected that \[Add app\] button earlier using Google Chrome.

Input the following:

* Category Equals to: Shopify App Store
* Action Equals to: Get App button
* Label Equals to: AppName – where AppName = what your app is called

📷

At this point, you’re 99% of the way there!

You can click “Verify this Goal” to see what % of visitors would have performed this action over the past 7 days. It feels pretty good if you’re doing this for the first time, you already had GA set up on your app listing before adding this Goal, and you see a value here. This was a little *woo-hoo!*moment for me.

Go ahead and click “Save” to set your Goal live and start tracking those \[Add app\] button clicks!

Take note: if you change your app name, you will need to update the Label value or else this Goal will no longer pass information to your GA account.

A few days after you’ve configured this Goal, you can start to gain valuable insights about the sources of traffic that are driving button clicks. To do so, click the Acquisition tab on your GA homepage, then click through to All Traffic &gt; Source/Medium. Use the Conversions tab to select the Goal and you’re set! You can now see what sources are driving people to click your \[Add app\] button.

📷

## Caveats

Okay, so this still isn’t a perfect solution.

You’re not *\*really\** tracking installs because it’s very possible that someone drops off after clicking that \[Add app\] button but before they complete your installation process.

This is still much better than nothing, and it provides a really valuable data point for all app devs. You’ll get a clearer understanding of what channels and campaigns, or specific blog posts and partnerships are driving people to take action on your app listing. You can also start to measure the delta between the number of clicks you’re getting and the number of true installs you’re seeing.

## Can this be improved?

Absolutely!

[Cross-domain tracking](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1034342?hl=en&amp;fbclid=IwAR2i6M2btqNk0PdZVjehh57cZKqTXT0QQIm7u0f8E5zYhFfcJxUYFehU6so) needs to be enabled by Shopify. It requires Shopify to update the tracking script that’s built into the app store. If this happened, a merchant’s path could be followed from apps.shopify.com/YourApp through to YourApp.com/install without starting a new session.

There are rumours floating around App Developer groups that this is on the radar for at least one team at Shopify. Feel free to send it along or mention this to anyone you know at Shopify HQ :)

Let me know in the comments below if you think this setup can be improved, or if you know another way to accomplish this!

I « « started » » to do eCommerce a year ago. I tried to open one shop, it was crap. A second one, less crap but still crap. Then a third one, again, less crap but still crap. 
So I stopped cuz’ I spent like a thousand dollars making those sites on Shopify with the apps and the advertising on Instagram. (I thought it’d be useful to pay a 500k influencer, it wasn’t).
I DIDN’T SELL ONCE.

shopify,I would like to make someone a Shopify site at no charge,"As the title states I would like to make someone a Shopify site at no charge. I have experience building websites, HTML, CSS, Dreamweaver back in the day :) but have decided recently to focus specifically in Shopify because of the popularity, usability and trust factor of the platform. I have built a few websites for myself with Shopify but have found at the end of all the product research, ordering and logistics, researching what I even want to sell, that eventually building and getting the websites running was the one part I was super passionate about and honestly enjoyed!  I found that happiness helps me create good looking, clean running sites as well.

So I have decided to create websites as a Shopify Partner, took the certs and am ready to go. I now need to build a portfolio and don't want to muck around on Fiverr hucking myself to the clueless masses. If you are interested in hearing me out:

I would like to make a website for someone offering a product or service that has a fleshed out idea, path,  passion for what they are doing. I don't care what it is just that you care about it, have done fair diligence and plan to immediately roll the website over to a functioning Shopify website through the proper Shopify website transfer process. This part is important to me as it again helps with my portfolio.

I would like a somewhat controlled project, about 2 weeks max and not too crazy on scope. I want to make sure I can meet all needs at a good pace and also I go in vacation in 2 weeks so it's a nice little hard timeline. You will have regular consultations, visibility into the progress, the whole 9 yards. I will do my best to be the ultimate professional for you.

So there it is, if you are interested please DM me with what your project is and where you are at with it. I will pick 1, maybe 2 in the day tomorrow.

Hi all, I hope this doesn't count as promotional material. I'm just really keen to get some feedback on a plugin I wrote. It's free and I don't earn anything at all from it.

It basically does all of the analytics tracking, and allows you to send very details events data to Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, AdWords and Zapier.

I saw other plugins that cost $ that do this kind of thing but focus only on the one 'destination'.

So you got the GA plugin, the FB pixel plugin, the Zapier plugin. This just does all of them. Also, there are a lot of advanced settings, like sending custom dimensions to GA and things like that.

shopify,A Shopify app to clear slow moving inventory instantly and profitably,"Thanks to the feedback I received in this subreddit, I’ve been building an app that I believe has the potential to revolutionize how many of us think about sales, discounting, inventory and cashflow when building out our brands. 

I’ve been in the game for a few years and clients have also been running into this issue constantly. 
 
Shoppers are behaving differently and have come to expect discounts. It’s hard to know what they’ll actually pay for so we do clearance sales and seasonal sales, but that still results in 60%+ abandonment rates
 
This is why we’re building Cohort. It’s an app to help you sell out inventory instantly and profitably by letting shoppers preauthorize payments for items they like at prices they feel comfortable paying.
 
As a merchant, you decide which offers to activate, giving you a brand new way to sell out any inventory you want without ever having to compromise on profit margins ever again. 

[This is what the preauthorization experience looks like.](https://twitter.com/usecohortcom/status/1150026033640464386?s=20)
 
We’re excited to have completed the product and we’re welcoming our first batch of pilot stores. 
 
Our plans are to make the app available to the greater Shopify app store this month.
 
If you’d like to get free access in exchange for feedback, please let us know by signing up for beta access at http://www.usecohort.com",8,5,2019-07-13,ECOM,0.017229771241545677,0.9119629263877869,0.07080733776092529

I just want to inform you that you can ask your supplier to put your logo or tags on each product they send out.

If you want your logos on shoe it may cost a bit more, 0.5-1.5$ per item. Anyhow it won’t be more than $1-1.25 per item, $1.5 might be the max I’ve got and there was no MOQ for it so it’s pretty good offer.

dropship,Dropshipping journey from tenth of failures to few successes,"I have been into this field for up to 5 years and before that I was working on an ecommerce elearning platform ( wordpress + woocommerce). So when I first heard about dropshipping I was someone with knowledge.. I knew how to build WordPress websites, I knew how to make a website run fast and what does slow a website, I had a good knowledge in coding as I am an engineer, I knew how to design photos and edit videos.... So in simpler words, when I first started with ecommerce and dropshipping I wasn't a newbie... I even had a huge experience running Facebook pages ( I was the co founder of 1.5 million likes page on Facebook... I have more than 45k followers on my personal Facebook profile ( the Arabic one not the English one)...   
Even though, the first store I built was a total failure! I worked on it for months, mastering everything... the logo, the products, the name, the descriptions, I didn't take anything for granted... like I truly did a huge effort... and I drastically failed!   
I lost more than 1000$ on the store and the ads.. but this didn't make me stop.. to be honest I thought about dropping the idea and moving on to another opportunity... but the idea of running a business while staying at home was very very appealing! Especially when I started thinking about having kids! I wanted to be there for them!  
So I didn't give up... It took me several trials and a good amount of time to finally be able to  earn my living online...    


I am saying this because I know how frustrated you might be feeling for working without getting results! I know exactly the feeling! Working for a project that doesn't seem doable to almost everyone all around you seems crazy, especially when you add to this investing your money!  


I have tried many online business Ideas over the years and I can count the successes but never the failures because they are too many!   


Work on your skills... don't rush out starting a business and thinking that it is super easy and you will make money without effort... You WILL NOT MAKE A PENNY IF YOU DON""T WORK HARD..

So I guess my question to you, is if you were in my position with your online store, how would you leverage this information to your benefit?

dropship,Casestudy - $60K ($25K net) in 1 month,"FIRST AND FOREMOST!

A DISCLAIMER:

\- I DO NOT sell courses. However, I do sell consultation calls.

\- DO NOT DM me and ask me to train you.

\- I will do my best to answer your questions in the comments. DO NOT DM me! Seriously, I mean it.

&amp;#x200B;

These are my results after I decided to stop following the gooroos and figure out FB ads by myself.

I launched my new store in August 2018 and ""invested"" about $1200 into FB ads before I saw success. While I cannot tell you which product I'm selling, I'll just mention that I'm in the ""Relationships"" niche.

The biggest takeaway for me essentially boiled down to one factor: Ad fatigue is caused by becoming lazy and not testing new creatives. Simple as that. You can be the master in running the ads but if you don't test new creatives, you'll fail.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I even took the time to write this post:I want to encourage you guys to not give up and test as much as you can. Test, test, test. Don't settle for just a couple grand of revenue a month. Shoot higher!

Mindset is such an overlooked part of being a successful businessman(woman). I grew up in a poor family in Ukraine and moved to the US when I was 11. Parents always struggled to make ends meet. We didn't always have food to eat.

This is the part most gooroos say: Here's how life was so miserable but I pulled myself out and was able to start supporting my mom/dad. BS.

I went into adult life, got married, had kids, and still struggled financially. Until I learned about dropshipping.

That in and of itself, exposed me to a whole new mindset that making money is actually easier than most people think.

I promised myself I will make $30K in my 2nd month of starting to dropship. Now, I didn't really fail on my promise.. I grossed $16k on my 2nd month. That's when all of my limiting beliefs were shattered.

From that point on, I was able to keep scaling until I hit my record, $60K revenue in 1 month. I was blown away.

Now, the store is much more stable, generating appx $30-45K a month with \~20% margins.

Some will tell you that it's not possible to have it on auto pilot - I will tell you that it's possible to have it on 99% auto pilot. I got my VAs doing almost everything. The only task I don't trust anyone with is new creatives and ad optimization (2-4 hours/week)

&amp;#x200B;

So, the takeaways:

\- Keep testing

\- Test

\- Test even more

\- Don't be afraid to ""lose"" money. You're investing that money instead, fool

\- Scared money don't attract money. If you got no money for ads, go make some before starting to test

\- Change your mindset - surround yourself with winners or those on the same journey

\- Set goals and push as hard as you can to achieve them

\- NEVER have plan B. It's all or nothing. It's do or die. Your back is against the wall. No other option. Do it!

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, if I did it, so can anyone else.

Post your questions here, I'll do my best to help you out. Anything relating to ads, optimizations, operations, hiring, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, no course for you to buy and I'm not looking to make money off any of you.

I have been running this [dropshipping store](http://casebay.co) for about **6 weeks** now with my business partner, the store has been **live for roughly 2 weeks**. We have run *3 ads (Instagram influencers)*, and have generated no sales, and very little traffic. *(Note: All 3 ads have been story + swipe up ads)*

At first, we were advertising a [Gameboy Phone Case](https://casebay.co/collections/phone-cases/products/retro-gaming-case), we saw that other people were selling with them and making sales, so we decided to hop on the trend. We were using these two influencers.

&amp;#x200B;

 \- [@\_playstation.gaming\_](https://www.instagram.com/_playstation.gaming_/) *(314,000 followers, 1.67% engagement rate).*

 \- [@oldschoolgamecollector](https://www.instagram.com/oldschoolgamecollector/) *(50,900 followers, 4.76% engagement rate).*

This is the [advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxL_d9HhmRk&amp;feature=youtu.be)...

&amp;#x200B;

Then after those two advertisements, we were told by somebody the product was overused and we ended up taking their word for it and moving to a different product. We were very ready to move on from this store and start a new one, but we were doing some product research and realized ""Airpods Cases"" are starting to trend. We saw that ""airpods cases"" are more popular than they have ever been before. We saw somebody else doing the hype-beast airpods case trend, so we decided to hop on that.

&amp;#x200B;

We then planned to advertise our [Supreme X Rimowa Airpods Case](https://casebay.co/collections/airpods-cases/products/supreme-x-rimowa-suitcase-airpods-case). We made a few ads we thought were perfect, cleaned our website up as much as we thought possible, and then released an ad. *(Note: We have seen people make sales with this influencer before).*

dropship,Facebook Ads Bidding Strategy - How would you utilise your first $200?,"Hello all,

I’d consider myself a lurker in this thread, but I thought now would be as good as ever to ask a question I think will be on many people’s minds - bidding strategy. I have been religiously combing through podcasts and threads for the past couple of weeks but I’m hearing differing opinions on bidding strategies for Facebook Ads.

As a dropshipping community, what are your own experiences of FB bidding strategy? I completely understand that the bottom line is to target those that are purchasing, but is this a realistic option for someone just starting out in the dropshipping considering the potential for budgetary limitations?

It would be great to hear everyone’s thoughts on this.  I constantly hear many mentioning the importance of “growing your pixel” by starting off with VC, ACC and then WC etc (Digital agencies &amp; Industry professionals) but often hear the polar opposite from gurus on YouTube and within the networking scene here in the UK (POD experts). Let’s hear your thoughts on this.",7,6,2019-07-19,ECOM,0.03567476570606232,0.9309297800064087,0.0333954393863678
ecommerce,Does anyone have experience being on the TMF / MATCH list?,"When applying for a new merchant account, I was told that I was denied for being on the Terminated Merchant File, or now I believe it's referred to as the MATCH (Merchant Alert To Control High-Risk) list due to excessive chargebacks from a business I ran for two years from 2016-2018.

For whatever reason, and I'm still trying to figure it out, this previous business had an unbelievable influx of fraudulent orders and stolen credit cards that resulted in a chargeback % that was too high. I was running a high volume store with 100-125 orders a day and I regularly got 10-15+ fraudulent orders a day, sometimes more. I had multiple measures in place to try and combat these chargebacks and I caught and canceled a vast majority of them, but apparently not enough and my chargeback ratio was too high to continue being supported by my current processor at the time.

I didn't think much of it and around that time I ended up taking a break from e-commerce anyway. However, I recently launched a new e-commerce business with a partner 2 months ago. Everything was going great and running perfectly until out of the blue we got dropped from our processor because they found my information on the MATCH list. This has completely halted our business as every processor we have tried to get a merchant account with has denied us immediately for being on this list and we have no ability to process orders at all.

With $50,000 invested in this business, I am absolutely devastated as the days continue to pass with seemingly no solution in sight. Everything I've read has said that I am completely fucked and have lost my credit card processing privileges for a minimum of 5 years, for something I sincerely tried my absolute hardest to manage. I guess I didn't do a good enough job.

Does anyone have any experience or opinions on what I can do here? Does anyone know of a way to continue processing payments while being on this dreaded blacklist? I'll take higher fees, lower monthly volume, whatever, I just need to get back into business.

shopify,Think twice before installing an App,"I have been recently going through all the tracking on many of my stores detected by uBlock origin and found a bunch of tracking code left behind by these Shopify app developers.


I know enough code to remove the hooks and js myself after uninstalling the apps, but I never checked the trackers using adblocker data. The number of sneaky tracking scripts in well-known apps were beyond astonishing. I check the usual places theme.liquid, etc to remove traces of leftover hooks from apps, but sometimes the tracking stuff is hidden in blog/collection pages as well so I am really weary now of installing any such app. I'll just use a duplicate theme to test apps from now on.





Shopify is supposed to be a good SaaS for people not into much code and I think their app review team needs to do a better job at checking what code is being inserted and protecting unsuspecting people from this.



Don't even get me started on the fact that app uninstall doesn't mean all hooks are removed from your theme. They need to force app devs to make a button that first cleans all embedded code from the theme and then another one for uninstalling it completely since apparently, they lose all access once a user removes the app.",24,53,2019-07-20,ECOM,0.09678756445646286,0.875286340713501,0.027926098555326462

shopify,Buying data from Mark Zuckerberg. $900 in total revenue and still not profitable,"BUT!

Today was our first profitable day :) so far we've spent $10 on ads and have gotten two sales for a total of $63. Not too shabby.
The cool thing about Facebook ads is that it gets easier. The more money you give Zuckerberg, the more data he gives you.
Today, one of our customers was a repeat visitor who first saw our ad 17 days ago and converted today.
Will this experiment continue to work? I honestly don't think so. It seems like to run Facebook ads properly you need a product or AOV that is at least $150.00. The rough math being $1.00 per (highly targeted) click... so spend $100, get 100 visitors to the site, get 1 sale (1% conversion rate) and break even. The goal would be to work towards a higher conversion rate of 3-5%.
We'll see. I do like buying facebook data and building out my pixel. Facebook is evil but super powerful.

dropship,3 ECOMMERCE CONVERSION TIPS FOR YOUR STORE,"I have posted this before. But thought of sharing it again for ay newbies coming in

I have been taking notes from day one on my ecommerce journey. Today I went back to my notes to see the things that had the most impact on my own and clients ecommerce success. So instead of my notes going to grave with me, I am sharing it here so someone else can learn and see success through it. Without any further, let's jump right into my 3 ecommerce conversion tips.  


1. No Surprises with price

Think of a product you like, and you get to know that you cannot afford it just before when it comes to making payment. In short, customers do not like surprises when it comes to the price.Display price on the product page itself; and if you are giving discounts or deals, list them there. Do not make them wait until the item has been added to the shopping cart or until they check out. Also, do not keep the delivery and handling charges hidden. It may lead to cart abandonment.

  
2)  Reduce ChoicesMore is not better. More options to choose leads customers to confusion.Trust me Most of your customers has Analysis Paralysis. So when you give them multiple variants of products to choose from they often get confused and either they leave your store or look at some other places for recommendations. When I say some other places I meant Google. When you search on google for a product there is a high chance for customers to find an exact duplicate of your product for a better price. So they will stick with them without getting back to your store.

  
3) User-Generated ContentThere’s nothing like a happy customer to help another make the decision to purchase. From customer testimonials and product reviews to social media images, anything that can be displayed towards the end of the purchase process that will help your cause should be incorporated. And to add urgency, include pop-ups that detail products which have recently been purchased by other shoppers.

  
Before you take out your credit card and start scheduling facebook ads, make sure that your store is set up for success and that you won't be leaving any money on the table.

dropship,My Experience Dropshipping Over the Last 3 Months,"Hey guys. So for a bit of backstory, I started dropshipping in April. So far I'm on my third store and have found little success. I'm going to talk about each store and where I went wrong. I hope some of you can find this useful and maybe even be able to offer some advice to me. 

# Store 1: Jewelry Store

So I started out with a jewelry store. All the designs were based on nature and the ocean. I thought this would be a good niche to start off in. I created some picture ads and advertised a free plus shipping wave ring on an ocean influencer Instagram page. I think I got about 5 sales. From there it was all downhill. I advertised the same thing on a smaller page and got only 1 sale. I kept on trying to advertise with influencers using similar and different strategies on each one. But, for some reason, I couldn't gain any sales. I ended up with a net loss for this store.

For this store, I think I went wrong with my niche. After spending some time on Instagram I found that jewelry was a very saturated niche, and other people were likely dropshipping the same thing as me.

# Store 2: Portable Blender

My second store was with one of those portable blenders. I focused on only this one product and built my store around it. I decided I wanted to try FB and Instagram ads. I was able to run some ads of a video I created for the product, but could not convert on any sales. After running about 5 ads my Facebook started having lots of issues and eventually got disabled. I still don't know what this happened. I was in good contact with a Facebook employee but they eventually stopped emailing me back. After the issues with the FB ads I made a deal with an Instagram influencer that I'd give them 20% of sales if they posted the video ad on their smoothie niche page. I was not able to gain any sales. 

In this store, I think I  went wrong with the FB ads. You shouldn't run FB ads unless you have a lot of time and most importantly money to experiment with. I also don't think I had a winning product, and should've done more product research before putting all of my money and time into one thing.

# Store 3: Health/Beauty/Accessories Store (Current)

So this is my current store. Knowing the importance of finding winning products I decided to use a tool to find winning products. I went with Product Mafia because they have a free version that lets you unlock 2 products per day for free. I was planning to buy the membership if I could generate sales. So I found I product I liked on the site and built a new store around that niche. I also picked out a few similar products from Product Mafia to put on my store. I used the same description, video ad, and even the recommended Instagram influencer to advertise on. So far I think I have only had about 13 page views, which is very low for a video ad on a page with 200k followers. They had a decent engagement rate and their followers didn't look like bots, so I don't really know what is going wrong.

If anyone has had any experience with Product Mafia or any other ones of these types of stores I would love to hear your experience and advice that you have had with them.

Thanks for reading my post. I hope some of you can find it useful (:",22,45,2019-07-24,ECOM,0.04663018137216568,0.9231128692626953,0.030256925150752068
shopify,Shopify Discord (chat servers) for professional conversations about Shopify,"**It seems like there are a few camps in the Shopify world.**  


a: **Entrepreneurs** who want to sell things but don't plan on learning programming. These people are more about systems and finding markets and all sorts of business stuff from legit stuff to just selling trash for a penny more. They know how to tweak the admin panels and setup modal discount windows and stuff.

b: Then there is the mid-range **entrepreneur/designer**/developer sort who is interested in building stores and can adjust some CSS or liquid templates / and have some good ideas but just don't have the programming skills yet. They know the admin pretty well / but maybe not as much about the market as the first group.

c: **Full-time design/developer** type people who build themes and custom apps and incorporate unique uses of things like Vue.js and who create things well off the trodden path.

d: **Hardcore programmers** who create custom apps and extend the capabilities of the framework. These folks usually don't have much interest in how things look.  


I don't care to be the owner necessarily - so, any community that can get enough interest is fine with me. Happy to combine them - but *one should be for developers specifically* \- and maybe another one for business stuff. (although everyone seems to want to keep everything a secret in that camp) That one's also going to get a lot of spam eventually - so, we'd better set up some permissions system there.

ecommerce,"I started selling funko pops as a side income in my business and it’s doing great, I feel I could sell much more If I went online","Hey guys!

I own a convenience store in a very crowded place in my city which I sell action figures as a side business. I started selling Funko Pops about eight months ago just because they are cute and I'm a huge geek. I started with 10 pops, now I sell like 50+ weekly.

I have over 250 contacts saved, which I notify about new releases and pops I can order using whatsapp. I have good supplier and prices.

I used to swarm them with pictures of upcoming shipments lol, now I share a slide with pictures of new products and I use dropbox link to show what I have in store. Pretty crass, I know, but it’s working out ok for now.

I know Instagram should be one of the next steps but I fear I won't have the time to do something ""showable"", I don't know. I know I could sell more online and bring more customers if started a wix or something but I'd have to start from scratch and I still have to take care of the store lol.

My question is, why are there no sales? Especially when I had at least 1 checkout from the last ad run, and 7 other checkouts from direct viewing.

ecommerce,"Could somebody recommend a platform for this idea? I have been struggling a bit with Shopify, and am wondering if something like WooCommerce would be better off?","Hey, I am starting up a site that helps coordinate contractors with clients. Obviously contractors are only able to travel within a certain vicinity, and I would like to allow customers to put in their location (Suburb, Zip Codes in my area encompass ridiculously large areas) and be matched with contractors who are willing to travel to their said area. These contractors would provide a service on a weekly basis (think nurses coming and assisting the elderly every week at set times).


I would like for customers to be able to input their suburb into a promotion bar, with autofill functionality (ideally to look like [this](https://imgur.com/earZUu9)). Once filled it would just set it to be that, and not forward them anywhere once autofilled.


They can then go and search for contractors when they select 'Our Contractors' or whatever,  which would only show contractors who have said that they will service said area. Our contractors are incredibly specialised, and would typically need 2 specific matches (i.e. What is your mobility level, and then languages spoken by nurse etc.). Im guessing tags or collections would be the best way to go about that. We would also need to prevent contractors from being hired from people who are not in that general locality.


So my needs basically involve:
* Location based results, with prevention for those not in general locality.
* Must input location before serving results
* 2 Levels of specification to be set (could be done in a side bar), and then only matching those who match with both specifications. I have been using collections and tags to do this thus far.
* Autofill in promotion bar (is there any extensions anyone knows that would support this in shopify?, or will I need to have one made).
* Recurring payments for services. Services may need to be canceled due to inavailablity of client or contractor, and obviously don't want to charge in that instance. Could anybody recommend a good recurring payment service for services, and customer accounts?


I have struggled a fair bit with Shopify, especially with location purchasing prevention/showing. My first idea to resolve this was tags, however obviously this doesn't orders. I do realise that I could just cancel the orders, but I would far rather, by a few orders of magnitude, that they were not possible in the first place. Also, autofill for locations in promotion bar?

I'm a freelance and I've been looking to insert an order management system into my WP-based website, so clients can go on the website, register their service order and track the status. The only visual example I've found of what I'm thinking is this: a due diligence screening order system made by a known US consultancy. I do legal translations and the order structure would be pretty similar to theirs.

How can I create this? Does a WP plugin exist?

ecommerce,"Site Has been up for 2 Weeks. Traffic, no sales yet. Advice on where to go next would be great!","First post here, hi. My name is Jack and I'm at the start of my business journey, 20- years old. I know it's a long game, absolutely understand that. But, I was wondering if anyone has any advice for a new store on the best ways to get free traffic. The store is https://www.vypr.store

The product is a portable USB charging blender, dubbed as the 'Vypr Go'. It is targetted at people who want to save time but keep on top of their nutrition, on the go.

So far, I have run a small Instagram story campaign and paid for a 24 hour influencer post. Both of these brought lots of traffic. The average day has 4-7 sessions and the influencer brought 49 in one day, 46 the next. I have a consistent IG page, with around 5 new followers per week. Daily content, sometimes 2 posts.

What can I do to convert these sessions into sales?

Note. I have updated my SEO, images and copy since the advert and promotions have ended, so I wonder if that will make a difference after a new promo?

I know the product is sellable because there is a competitor 'Blendjet' who have sold around 100,000 units I believe. 

Any help here would be appreciated to put me in the right direction!",30,27,2019-07-28,ECOM,0.020259730517864227,0.9147976040840149,0.06494270265102386

ecommerce,"New Entrepeneur to E-Commerce (Toronto, Canada)","Hello everyone,

This is my first time posting and thought it would be great to get some advice/tips from the reddit community here!

Just a little intro:

I'm 22 in Toronto, Canada and wanted to start my own e commerce business. I'm planning to attend college this year followed by a Masters (1 year program) the next year and plan to work full time in my career while I manage my ecom business on the side (part time). Ultimately, my goal is to be able to retire early (when I'm 30 for example) with my e commerce business, that I've built from the ground up (hopefully can profit over $70k/year by that time).

I have little to no experience in E-Commerce and understand that building an e commerce business takes an extensive amount of time, commitment and great persistence and I am prepared for that. I am very serious about starting my business and plan to do mostly everything for this site myself and will get help when needed.

I have done research on e commerce and different business models and right now I needed help on narrowing down which B2C model would be optimal, given my limitations (personal finances, time commitment and ecom experience). I've compiled the following list of what I have as of now,

&amp;#x200B;

1. Dropshipping
2. Wholesale - Out
3. Warehousing &amp; Stockholding
4. POD
5. Branded Business
6. White &amp; Private label model
7. Subscription Services

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I want to build sustainable site that can be content-based (where I can write my own blogs, articles, etc), sell and dropship services/products (primarily informational) while also being able to build my own personal brand, and is B2C based. It can start as a single category, single to multiple product business and plan to use Shopify as my platform. Is all this possible with Shopify?

I would also like to know how I can keep my business afloat and profit well in the future (1-10 yrs from now). I know as I gain more experience, I could progress to a different business model, sell my business, own multiple businesses, though I would really like to keep things simple and have my own store that I've built over the years that can still generate enough passive income (where I don't need to working a 9-5 anymore).

TLDR: Need helping narrowing down which B2C E com model would be best to get into, in order to build a sustainable, profitable e commerce business. Any general tips/advice/mistakes to avoid on building a successful B2C e commerce business for someone new to it.

I currently work for a business that sells to brick and mortar stores. We are looking at created a secondary business that would be separate from the core business.

My main confusion comes down to figuring out what is the best way to do this ""right"".

Is Shopify a viable option when you are considering a global market, various currencies and various distribution centers to ship/fulfill the product? Or does Shopify cater more to the individual online retailer than a larger corporation?

Is getting a custom site built for Magento the route to go?

I'll be honest I'm not well versed in the world of E-Commerce so I'm really open to any suggestions or feedback any of you great minds have to offer! I've been curious and am a Graphic Designer so I have some knowledge but not in-depth.

shopify,I'll build (and host) a backend workflow for your store using Shopify webhooks,"A couple of days ago, I suggested to store owners that could use Shopify Webhooks to create complex backend workflows instead of buying apps which (a) are expensive, (b) may not support your specific use case or (c) make your site slow and open up a security risk.

A dead simple use case for webhooks could be to be notified via email when inventory levels at a location change or a refund is requested. More complex workflows could be to forward an order directly to a third party fulfillment center without manual intervention. If you can imagine it, it can probably be built.

So, if you need a quick little workflow which you believe can be built relatively easily and don't want to buy an app with expensive monthly subscriptions to do it it, let me know in the comments.

dropship,Don't Waste Your Time With These Strategies,"Here are all the failed strategies I've followed that simply do not work. Do yourself a favor and steer away from them. It should help you  save $10,000 or more...

**Buying a premium theme.** Just don't waste your money on all these themes. They will not magically make your products start selling. Any basic (free) theme will suffice. In fact, I've seen 5% conversion rates on the default Shopify themes. You do not need all those fancy timers, pop-up notifications, fake scarcity things, fancy sliders, etc. Only invest in a premium theme if it has the design you need for a product that has reached the selling/branding phase.

**Courses.** Big waste of money. I'll give $1,000 right now to anyone who can find something in a course that you cannot find for free on YouTube. 

Of course (no pun intended), someone might say, *""but courses organize the stuff better.""* Complete nonsense. Anyone who wants to succeed in the ecommerce world needs to learn how to organize things themselves. 

**PPE ads.** They just don't work. Nowadays, you're better off going straight to a purchase campaign. Boom. You just saved $1,000 in ""testing.""

**Buying data from Facebook.** This is one of the biggest lies out there. Everyone tells you that you need to buy data for your pixel and campaigns. This is not a viable strategy. Think about it; you're literally buying data about not making sales, so why would this data ever make you a sale? Junk data will always be junk. All you have is data on what doesn't work. 

On the contrary, not all data is useless. It's perfectly fine to buy data as long as that data pertains to sales. This will allow you to make lookalike audiences for scaling.

**Trying to force a product to work.** There's no way to force a product to work. If the product has a bad CPC and bad purchase conversion, then it's going to be extremely difficult to turn a profit. You need to find something competitive to compete against competition in the marketplace.

**Automatic placements for testing.** Don't waste time with these when testing. Simply start with the Facebook mobile newsfeed. It's the cheapest option. If something doesn't work on the Facebook mobile newsfeed, then odds are it won't anywhere else. You can test automatic placements once you find a ""winning"" product.

**Waiting for Facebook to optimize.** Selling a product at a loss? Don't expect anything to magically happen after reaching 50 conversions. You'll likely just keep losing money. Also, make sure to kill all ad if you spend over $5 and CPCs are over $2. If a product is junk right off the bat, then it'll probably continue to be junk.",56,61,2019-07-30,ECOM,0.09085752069950104,0.8838772773742676,0.02526516653597355

dropship,Some Myth's And Truths About Online Businesses (Including Dropshipping),"Okay, I've followed this sub for a while now and have to get some things off my chest. There is SO much misinformation going around that it almost sickens me, and I want to take a moment and share my experience with online business. I think everyone means well, but I think most people in this sub are merely wandering blindfolded and are giving out information they heard, they read, or they saw, but not what they've actually experienced.

Disclaimer: I'm not going to show any 'proof' that I know what I'm talking about, so don't ask. If you don't believe what I have to say, than simply ignore this post. But I will tell you this... I've owned my online business for over 2 years and have spent well into the 6 figures in just the last few months in PPC. I advertise on Google and Facebook.

Myth 1: I need to test 100 products to find one that works.

Fact: Test 1 or 2. Facebook ads (which it seems like most people on this sub are trying) are a VERY complicated beast. You can't pick 100 products and run a $5 campaign for each and determine from there. You might get lucky, but you're basically playing the lottery. Pick 1 STELLAR product and keep trying until you figure it out. I bought all my inventory upfront, so I HAD to make it work. I found a way. There's no other motivation quite like dropping thousands of $$$ on 1 product... you literally have no other choice or you just lost a lot of money. The key is to make sure you pick a product that you KNOW will work...

And how do you do that?

Myth 2: If other businesses are doing it, the market is already saturated and this product won't work anymore.

Fact: Totally bogus. I'm not sure why, but I take this one personally, lol. I don't know who started it, but the truth is if other businesses are selling it, that only means 1 thing - it works! You've just got to figure out how to do it better... or faster... or cheaper. Sure, there are things to keep in mind that can set you up for long-term success like... can this product be bought over and over again? is it novel? is it unique? etc. But I will NEVER pick a product that nobody is selling because - chances are - that means somebody probably tried it and it didn't work!

Myth 3: It's easy to build a long-term, sustainable, cash flowing business with a generic Shopify store.

Fact: You've got to learn SALES. This is another thing that kind of gets under my skin. All of these ""Review my site!"" posts where every single page looks the exact same. Put yourself in the shoes of your potential customer for just a second... Chances are they've already been to a site that looks EXACTLY like yours with a different name, different logo, and slightly different colors, but it's the same game. This will scare them away in a heartbeat.

I haven't seen nearly enough sites that actually tell me WHY I need their product. It's merely a generic name with an AliExpress photo and a couple of benefits with a ""Now on sale!"" sticker slapped on it. I'm sorry to say, but 99% of the time that will not work and you're wasting money and time. After learning about BigSpy (sign up and check it out, it's free), within 5 minutes I found a LEGIT business making 7 figures - easily - that looked absolutely nothing like these cookie-cutter Shopify stores. In fact, it was an old fashioned sales letter and was absolutely crushing it. It's a long held truth in advertising that STORY sells better than BENEFITS. Get good at STORY.

Again, I'm confident a free theme will do just fine. But you've got to show the customer why they can trust YOU to solve their problem, or what sets YOU and YOUR product apart from everyone else.

So how do you even go about doing this? There are countless ways! Put a testimonial front and center of your landing page. Add a problem-solution sequence narrative on your landing page. Put a VSL on your landing page. Put your social proof on the landing page (endorsed by John Doe-Guru! or something like that).

Myth 4: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ course is the best for learning dropshipping/business/etc!

Fact: This is where I'm going to get unconventional a bit... Courses have their place. This sub has it's place. However, the BEST way to fast track yourself to success is not a course or spending ""X"" amount of dollars figuring it out and hoping you hit it big.

Instead, I believe in teaming up and PARTNERING with someone who knows what they're doing. I know more business owners that are actually ""shared"" owners of businesses than I know solo guys. Why is that? Everyone has their area of expertise.

You'll learn so much more from a mentor or partner than you will on your own, honestly.

How do you do that? Truthfully, I'm not sure? Be social. Get to know entrepreneurs who share your passion. Surround yourself with successful business owners. Insecure that you don't know what you're doing? Here's a trick...

Say there's an entrepreneur you want to work with who knows WAY more than you and can actually teach you how to do it. Pitch them a 50/50 split where each of you own half the company (and profits). The catch is you'll do all the work, but they'll provide all the strategy. It's literally no risk for them. IF it works out, it's easy money for them and I guarantee you'll avoid the most expensive mistakes that everyone else makes and have a greater chance of making money.

That's it for now. There may be more but this is already longer than I wanted it to be. Good luck!

Edit: In case anyone was wondering why I wrote this up... No, I don't have a youtube channel I'm secretly promoting. No, I don't sell a course. No, I don't have an advertising agency or anything like that. I'm just a young entrepreneur that's learned a thing or two and I wanted to share what I know for free in the hopes that it might help someone get out of debt, or feed their family, or something else mushy and positive.

shopify,What is the reasoning behind not sharing a link to your store?,"Hi, long-time lurker here. I’m developing a store myself and would love to eventually share the link to get feedback on what I could improve. That said, I’ve read some posts from folks who don’t want to share their URL for fears of either: 


A) having their niche being usurped by someone with more resources, or 

B) Having their SEO be maliciously de-optimized by savvy competitors. 


How likely are these scenarios? Especially B? That sounds bizarre and excessively cutthroat to me, but I honestly have no idea exactly how brutal this space is so maybe it’s true. 

I’d appreciate any honesty so I can avoid any trolls out there - and also, what might be a safe way to solicit for critiques if URL-sharing is not the way to go.

Thanks!",19,14,2019-07-31,ECOM,0.033065587282180786,0.9120675325393677,0.05486684292554855
ecommerce,[HELP] Shipping and inventory questions,"Hello, I have a few questions that no matter how much I search, I don't feel like I can find a good answer.

Long story short, I am in the process of building an ecommerce business (not dropshipping, a real business with inventory I handle). For now, I will be handling everything on my own until I'm happy with the process, then I will look into a 3PL service possibly.

My concerns with shipping and inventory management kind of go together.

My first question, are there good shipping services that also provide inventory management? I was looking at Shipping Easy because they seem to be popular and offer both services at a good price. The other option I was looking at was Shipstation because the pricing seems similar. Not sure how their inventory management is because they really don't talk about it on the site other than a few spots. Note, I also plan to sell on multiple platforms such as Etsy, Amazon, etc and these services seem to integrate with all.

Also, does anyone use Pirate Ship? I used their calculator and they seemed to have the best rates. I would think most of these companies have the same rates though. Does anyone have experience?

Lastly, does anyone use multiple shipping solutions? Is it worth it to go back and forth for better rates depending on where/what you're sending?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

dropship,Converting From one product store to niche,"From what I have been able to gather online. It seems that the real money is made when you are selling ever-green products in a niche store, where you a consistent returning customer base and don't rely on cold traffic from facebook. 

But I've also been told that it is hard to jump straight into a niche store as it really limits your potential product options. That's why people on YouTube have talked about either starting a general store and narrowing down into a niche, or one product then expanding into the niche. 

Which one do you guys think is better personally? 

And how would you go about completing the transition? I mean you will have to change your name (general name)/ (one product name) to a niche specific name. 

The reason why I am asking this is I feel that I have found a winning product, but I don't think I can build a one product store around it, simply because doesn't have enough wow factor. So I'm wondering if i should just go general.",5,8,2019-07-31,ECOM,0.022715996950864792,0.8906175494194031,0.0866665318608284

shopify,Shipping and chargeback insurance for high priced items?,"I'm about to launch a store with a high priced items (~$2k) and shopify have nothing apart from standard $100 shipping insurance. 

I can't afford to take a hit like that if lost in transit, god forbid a chargeback, so can anyone advise on:

1, Shipping Apps that allow higher insurance rates

2, Legit Chargeback insurance partners (that actually pay out - I've read scare stories from some that don't actually protect you).

Also, does anyone have any tips, like best practice things to set up on the site at point of sale that would bolster a chargeback response? Kinda like a contract that waives the right to a chargeback at point of placing order?

ecommerce,Website Review Request - Pole Fitness Apparel,"Hello E-commerce community,

I am requesting a review of my website. I did phenomenal in person sales at a pole competition. However, that success is not translating to my website. I also have the shop feature activated in my Instagram. Unfortunately, Instagram is shadow banning a ton of pole accounts (including other pole apparel accounts) and hashtags so I'm having trouble increasing my Instagram following. Any feedback is appreciated. Please be mindful this is pole fitness apparel designed for women who love pole as a sport and a hobby. It is not a brand that is trying to appeal to men.
