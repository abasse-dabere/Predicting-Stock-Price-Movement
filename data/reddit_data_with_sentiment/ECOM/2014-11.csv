Als offiziell zertifizierte Google Partner Agentur gilt es außerordentliche Kompetenz im Bereich des Suchmaschinenmarketings mit Google Adwords nachweisen zu können. Im Rahmen des Google Partners Bootcamps in Berlin hat unser Online Marketing Manager Stefan G. Meier letzte Woche die Grundlagen- und die Fortgeschrittenen-Prüfung für Suchmaschinenmarketing mit Google AdWords erfolgreich bestanden.

Dieses Zertifikat beweist unsere Kenntnisse mit Google Adwords Kampagnen und soll das Vertrauen unserer Kunden in unsere Kompetenz im Bereich Suchmaschinenmarketing stärken. Wir garantieren unseren Kunden eine hohe Qualität im Umgang mit Google Adwords und kümmern uns um das professionelle Setup und laufende Betreuung und Optimierung von SEA-Kampagnen.

 

**So wird man Google Partner**
Google schreibt dazu: “Wir möchten ein starkes Partner-Programm, das sich als Marke profiliert und Unternehmen als Gütesiegel dient. Google wird zukünftig verstärkt das Partner-Programm in die eigene Kommunikation aufnehmen, um Unternehmen zu helfen, qualifizierte Google-Agenturen zu finden.”

**Die Kriterien, um das Google Partner-Logo zu erhalten, sind dementsprechend anspruchsvoll:**

Die Agentur muss eine gewisse Ausgabenhöhe im Kundencenter-Konto nachweisen (derzeit 7.500 Euro innerhalb von 90 Tagen).
Mit “Best Practices” wurde ein Qualitätsstandard eingeführt, der die Leistung der betreuten AdWords-Konten bewertet und optimale Kundenbetreuung gewährleisten soll.
Mindestens ein Mitarbeiter der Agentur muss zertifiziert sein und seine Fachkompetenz durch mindestens zwei absolvierte Prüfungen nachweisen, die alle zwei Jahre (Grundlagenprüfung) bzw. jährlich (Fortgeschrittenenprüfungen) wiederholt werden müssen.
 

**Google Partner Agentur: Vorteile für unsere Kunden**
Was bringt die Zertifizierung im Google Partner Programm für unsere Kunden? Google liefert dazu die beste Antwort: ""Das Google Partner-Logo zeigt Ihren Kunden, dass wir Ihnen vertrauen. Das Logo steht für erstklassige AdWords-Kenntnisse, nachweislich hervorragende Ergebnisse und erfolgreiche Aktivitäten in Ihren AdWords-Konten.”

Zur Sicherung unseres hohen Qualitätsstandard erhalten wir im Rahmen der engen Zusammenarbeit mit Google umfangreiche Unterstützung und exklusives Insiderwissen, z.B.  durch die Google Partner-Akademie und die exklusive Google Partner-Community. Seit einiger Zeit haben wir auch direkte Ansprechpartner bei Google und werden in Zukunft an weiteren Zertifizierungs-Prüfungen teilnehmen.

My partner and I just started an e-commerce site where we sell other people's products (drop-shipping) with a central theme on our website. For example - lets say our theme is Leather (it's not but sake of conversation let's say it is).










**Products**  



Leather bags, wallet, accessories, etc.  All central around our ""leather"" theme.

**Business Model**  


Charge 8% for drop shipping other people's product

**Advertising**       

The idea is rankable and has no central marketplace.  Our main focus will be GoogleADs, Facebook, and other social media platforms.  We will also have our own blog to rank easier and possibly hire an SEO guy from eLance.




**Our Main Concern**


How to get people to visit our site? How to maintain visitors? Because our business focuses heavily on just the theme and not a specific product, is it too broad?






Essentially we want to be the marketplace for this type of theme - is that approachable? Pros and cons? Suggestions?",0,1,2014-11-04,ECOM,0.023344816640019417,0.938575029373169,0.03808016702532768

We are a new sock brand - [US Sock Company](http://www.ussocks.com) and we are looking for interested e-commerce retailers and one or two established dropshipping e-commerce sellers to help us fine-tine and streamline our dropshipping system before we release it to the general retail public.  We have a nice warehouse in Virginia and most of our orders by 2pm Eastern go out the same day.

Our products are no-frills, inexpensive, but high quality cotton/nylon socks made in the U.S. in low-cut, ankle, crew and over the calf lengths in about 6 different colors. Our manufacturing capacity is tens of thousands of socks a month.  Right now we only have diabetic socks in inventory (non-constrictive tops to allow for better circulation), but it is a fairly large market.  We will be adding regular socks by the first of 2015.  

We can currently ship small and large diabetic sock orders in any available color and length in about 2 weeks to retailers who wish to fulfill orders themselves.  

All Socks have branded bands, hang tags, UPCs, and are packaged in 3-packs which are sealed in bags of 4 (1 dozen pairs of socks per bag).

As far as drop-shipping. We are hoping to make the drop-ship order process as automated as possible to save us and you time. We have experienced programmers on staff and will be able to customize the process in a variety of ways as needed if you prefer placing orders online, emailing orders or connecting to an API.  We don't have a ton of models for drop-shipping, but we do have some basic best-sellers and are adding more models to our stock every month as we grow.

ecommerce,new ecommerce startup equity problem,"About a year ago a friend and I decided to start a new ecommerce startup in the fashion sector. I have many years experience in fashion ecommerce - I have built a popular brand and currently run that with my husband.
We decided to split the equity in 33% between my husband, me and my friend.

My friend has experience in the fashion publishing sector but has no business acumen or experience.
I on the other hand have built the website and app, started marketing it on social media and built a blog and hired content writers and will be in charge of working with brands and seo. I'm a gogetter and a jack of all trades. I'm constantly learning new things.

My husband will be in charge with email marketing, some customer service and post processing of photos (major part of the site).

My friend is solely responsible with running photo shoots of the products and choosing products to work with and their styling.

We are at the point that we are waiting to start shooting product and my friend has recommended that we take her husband on as an equity partner because he has a full time job in a corp and could really help us with new ideas etc. I think this is a joke. He can't put in the same time and his after work life is devoted to his children.

I feel like without me there would be no chance of this startup even existing. I could spend money and hire someone to do her job and it would cost less than her hiring someone to do my job(s).

My husband and I have stated that this would be a bad idea since her husband's partnership would not bring anything new to the table. My husband and I have recently hired a person to take over some of our responsibilities in our old business so that we would have more time for this new startup. My husband and I have put up 50% of the costs to grow this startup while my friend has put up the remaining 50%.

I want to tackle this well and focus my decision on good business etiquette and reasonable. I want a win-win. I do not want to minimize my equity so that my husband and I together have 50% and her family have 50%. Also, I do not see my friend taking over my husbands responsibilities. She says she could learn with time. Yes, that is true but this startup is not school... she can learn in her free time.

Also, our families spend our free time together. Obviously this might change.

ecommerce,Need help to make shop a business,"Hey Reddit,

About two years ago I wanted to order some tape and I found out there was no shop selling this brand in my country. So a friend and me started our own webshop to sell it.

The problem is, we mainly sell one product (specific kind of glue). But the company that makes this product doesn't want te sell directly to us. For different reasons (packaging not in correct language, not enough market to put effort in my country, etc).

So our only option is to order this product from other stores in different countries. Because of this we pay consumer prices to get it here and can only sell it with very little profit. Our prices are pretty high allready and if we make them higher most people would just order it in other countries like we do.

We have about 30 other products but they don't sell very well. About 25 of these products have never been sold since we started (about a year ago).

We do have costumers and on average we get an order about once a day. But with so little orders and a very small margin of profit we make almost no money.

How can we turn this around? 

TL;DR we sell mainly one product with very little profit",9,3,2014-11-11,ECOM,0.04930596053600311,0.9153043627738953,0.03538963571190834

ecommerce,Review my product please! Retention Hero - Identify valuable customers early and keep them coming back,"Hi /r/ecommerce,

I've been a lurker in /r/startups and /r/Entrepreneur for years, and now I'd like to get some feedback on my latest project. I'm building a lifecycle marketing and predictive analytics tool for e-commerce stores called Retention Hero. In a nutshell, you hook it up to your store platform and Retention Hero predicts who your most valuable customers will be, when they'll most likely return to buy again, and identifies customers who are at-risk of losing engagement. And it helps you set up ongoing email campaigns to send targeted marketing to these segments automatically, at exactly the right time.

I have a few beta testers on Shopify currently, and so far the feedback has been universally positive. But I'd like to get some feedback from you guys as well. Is this something that would solve a pain point for you? Would you pay money for it? Does the sales website make sense to you?

ecommerce,How To Cheat On eCommerce &amp; Get Away With It,"Who You Are

You're running your own eCommerce store and you may even be using external providers to help push sales out such as eBay. You're sales are coming in steadily but you’d love to burst the glass ceiling on sales and really start to push more of the same products out so that you can take further advantage of bulk ordering discounts.




What Is This Cheat?

Do you think you would be at an advantage or disadvantage if you knew what images, headlines and calls to action made people click before actually posting your products online?


That’s exactly where you can make a massive difference to your online sales and appearance, by doing eCommerce Testing. I’m not talking about the 1 percenters here, this is the kind of change and insight that could revolutionise your ecommerce store and propel you into a whole other world of trying to get multiple containers into the country to keep up with demand.


By testing your product images prior to launching them live you can find out whether visitors would respond better to a nice looking person holding your item as opposed to your item cleanly placed on a white background for example. You would find out before hitting the ‘Post Listing’ button which headlines will actually catch peoples eyes! which will entice visitors more to click and view your complete listing. What about the holy grail, the all important Call To Action button, what works best? Buy Now, Purchase, Get It, Next Step, Add To Cart, Choose, Pay or any other word combination you can think of. 


The point is you don’t need to guess, rather you just need to ask your audience… Sounds simple right? but you’d be surprised how few people are actually testing there images, headlines and calls to action even though their listings are what keep them in business.
 




How Can You Do It

You have a few choices to conduct ecommerce testing. Either gather round a bunch of people who you’d consider to be your ideal client, place them all in front of either a printed version or a digital version of what you’d like to test. Set the scene telling them to imagine that they are searching the web, have just landed on your products page and are looking for exactly your type of product. Ask them the all important question, “which of the images displayed would you click on if you were going to purchase this product”.
Gather your results and collect your newly found insight.
Another way to do it is by using a service such as Visual Website Optimizer or Optimizely, although more focussed on website changes they could still do the job for a monthly fee, they also allow you to track results and easily update things yourself.


If you're still unsure what the best way is, you can always contact us, we’ve been taking the task of eCommerce Testing very seriously and now have a large team of over 100 participants we can call on to conduct exactly these types of tests. 
 




What The Results Will Mean 

By now this question should have already answered itself, if you’ve tested your images, headlines and calls to action and you’ve chosen the successful variations then logic will tell you that the results can only be better than what you are achieving right now. 


Have a go at it yourself, jump on eBay, search for anything and check out the huge range of ways people choose to present their information. There are many people selling the same products but for some reason some make more sales than others. 


Testing your ecommerce product listings and site Images, headlines and calls to action have the ability to create trust or fear, encourage purchase or produce distraction. Be wise, there’s no need to create unnecessary roadblocks in the ecommerce sales process.

ecommerce,How To Start An Ecommerce Business,"So here you are, you’ve got an idea!. We’ve all been there, it’s exciting you're full of energy and motivated to start selling online. 

But where do you start? what do you spend and how in the world are people going to find out about you!???

At least you’re not the only one to ever ask those questions. Getting started will depend on a few things. 

Your industry and therefore where your customers will be
Your budget and available resources
How much time you have and how tech savvy you are

An Idea

The online world is a cluttered place with people selling everything you could possibly think of, your challenge will be to differentiate yourself from all the others in the market. If its a product then perhaps price will become a concern via competition from China and their ability to undercut Australian pricing. If you're selling an online service, what makes you different and why would anyone choose to use your service over the people already in the market?

The answer to this in my opinion is to pick a micro niche, a small segment of a market and target your marketing efforts and entire business image towards that group. What you’ll find is that you’ll be able to market far most cost effectively knowing that you're wasting less of your advertising budget. You’ll also have the advantage of owning your eCommerce Real Estate. That’s right it’s the bricks and mortar of the online world, own a space or niche and become the dominant player within that market. 

The more specific the better, for example a niche might be fitness equipment however a micro niche could be fitness equipment for rehabilitation of spinal injuries. All of a sudden your market and your ability to target your market becomes far more doable.

It’s a nice thought to think that your product can be for every man woman and child but the reality is if you're targeting such a broad market you may just be speaking to no one at the same time.

Implementation


Once you’ve settled on your micro niche and you’re comfortable that you enjoy that industry and can see yourself working late nights and weekends trying to make it work, then it’s time to start building your empire.


This is where your budget and time will come into play, if you don’t have a big budget or a lot of time then creating a comprehensive eCommerce site will become a drain on you but if your product permits you could start by selling on eBay or Amazon. However there is a safer way to get going.

The Foundation


Before going out and buying anything before spending any large sum of money, a great way to test your idea is by gaining a level of interest from your specific market. You do this by contacting your target market directly and asking them if they would be interested in what you will be selling, you can ask them how much they would pay for such an item and whether they are currently buying something similar, and what they’re happy and unhappy with regarding the current seller. 


Another great way is to create a simple and sometimes free Landing Page, this is a one page website that has one purpose - to generate leads. You would use this together with online marketing methods such as Social Media (free and paid methods) and Search (free and paid methods) to drum up traffic to the page and have people who are interested register their email.


At least this way if after 1 month you’ve gained 100 interested people you know that your idea has legs and people would be interested in buying from you, even better if you have 1000 emails then all of a sudden you don’t just have confidence to continue but you actually also have bargaining power to go to your wholesaler and ask for better pricing.


Getting help


If time and budget really are a massive issue for you, then getting to the stage of having a big list of people interested in you product can serve as the perfect tool for getting an investor on board. The seed investor could bring not just money to the table but resources, experience and connections which could sky rocket your business into a whole new level.


No one can take the first step for you, but you! at least give it a try.

ecommerce,Searching for a small shop system that can be integrated into an existing website,"Recently I was asked several times to integrate a small online shop into an existing website. Some sites wanted to sell a few merchandise articles to help financing their main functions, other ones needed a little shop to sell handcraft like wooden games or other things the owners produced at home or in little factories. However they all had in common that they did not need a fully-featured and bloated shop system for thousands of products but a little page inside their normal website to sell up to ten maybe twelve articles. 

Now I'm searching for a little shop system that provides this key features:

* It should be customizable so it can be integrated into a website. It is important that it can be styled so matches the design of the whole site. 
* I do not need things like user accounts etc. It is enough when there is an article overview, the article detail sites, a simple shopping cart and an easy checkout process. A simple backend for me is a nice-to-have but not necessary. 
* For the payments PayPal would be enough, but if there are other options this would be nice too. 
* On the article detail site it would be nice to have the option to allow the user to choose details like color and/or size. 

Do you use some system that may fit my needs or do you know a system that offers this features? I would be happy if you tell me about it.

ecommerce,"Looking to switch our platform, need some advice (involving specific features)","Little bit of background: I work for a small company (just over a dozen employees) and run our webstore pretty much by default because I'm the only one who actually knows a thing or two about HTML/CSS. That being said - I don't know a lot. Even working with JavaScript involves a *whole* lot of google.

Our company is currently using Volusion, but are being held back by a lack of certain features. We're looking to switch, but I need some advice for where to go that will suit our needs.

The most important feature we're lacking is dependant product options on a bundle product (ie the available choices in drop-down B are determined by the selection in drop-down A.) Magento can do this with an extension, but I don't know if any of the other platforms have this functionality at all. In particular, all of the options need to reflect existing skus and track inventory for them, and either not be selectable or show a warning if that sku is out of stock.

A large portion of our sales come from wholesale clients, and we'd like to set it up so they can use our storefront as well for straightforward orders instead of always going through phone, etc. Not only is the base price different for wholesale customers, but option prices are also lower. It doesn't matter to us if it's through the same or a different listing on the site, but it does matter that inventory for the retail and wholesale versions is tracked collectively. In an ideal world, we could have a separate storefront at something like ourdomain.com/wholesale that can only be accessed by logged-in wholesale customers. We also have two different classes of wholesale customer (online only and brick-and-mortar) and we can only sell certain products to one group due to exclusivity contracts, etc. And of course, wholesale orders have an MOQ.

It's also important to us to have strong analytics and metrics - sales tracking by sku and category, information about when and where (geographically as well as referrer) our page views are coming from, etc. This is one of the few things Volusion is doing very well with SmarterStats, and we're not trying to lose any of that functionality.

I believe Magento will do all of this but I'm a little concerned about how difficult it could/would be to get it all up and running with my fairly limited background. I understand that other providers like Shopify and BigCommerce are supposed to be more user-friendly, but I don't want to end up in the same situation we are in now where lack of features holds us back.

We are looking for a hosted solution (currently using about 30-60GB of bandwidth per month and growing) and with my limited background some degree of support is important, though **good** community support could do the job.

What would you suggest?",17,8,2014-11-20,ECOM,0.13920682668685913,0.8353357911109924,0.025457382202148438

Question regarding 'Destination State' Jurisdictional Tax in California,"I've been tasked with trying to calculate sales tax based on the zip code (jurisdictional tax district) for customers on my clients site.

They are using Adobe Business Catalyst which seems extremely limited in terms of customization and/or features. I've found a company that essentially keeps an updated database of the 1700+ district taxes for CA and has an API that allows you to calculate the tax by zip code in your shopping cart. However, I don't see any indication that it'll work with Adobe's platform.

To make a longer story short.. Is there a base tax rate that we can charge in CA without getting hit later for taking shortcuts? Is there a provision in the law for interstate sales? Anything like that at all?

I'd love it if you could PM me with what types of info you're interested in for my blog.


*Original Post:*

I've felt this way for awhile - there's nobody really covering the ecommerce beat to the point where I think there's an authority. I'm a fan of Andrew at eCommerce Fuel, but he posts like 2-3 times/month on average, and most activity happens in the paid forums. 

Other than that, I only read the Shopify blog and get the daily Internet Retailer email, which is only for ecom executives it seems.

Is there anyone doing this already, or do you have any interest in this:

* Daily posts covering ecommerce news, like Google AdWords or algorithm changes, platform updates, recent studies
* Weekend wrap-ups featuring the big news of the week
* Articles on ecommerce CRO, PPC strategy/tactics
* Tips on improving your operations and fulfillment
* Coverage of industry events like Internet Retailer, eTail, or HeroCon

I guess I'm just wondering if there's something I'm missing out there. There are tons of blogs focused on the daily SEO and PPC changes, Silicon Valley stuff.... but nothing for the average ecommerce store owner or beginner. I'm seriously interested in filling the void, I just want a better idea of what people want or if everyone's happy with what they have now.",7,15,2014-11-21,ECOM,0.039007432758808136,0.9266173839569092,0.034375108778476715
ecommerce,User Banned - Explanation,"An explanation of what happened - want to be as transparent as I can be.

Yesterday I banned a user who has been reported numerous times in this sub for quite a while now.  I had discussed the situation with the user some weeks back and explained that they were being reported for posting comments that were not helpful to OP.  Things did not get better and yesterday words got a little ugly by numerous users in one of the posts.  I banned the user for 5 days and accompanied that with a lengthy explanation of the ban and some of my own opinions on the situation.  

This morning the user started a new account and responded by trying to post my pm to them (which was intended to be exactly that, a private message) as a text post here on the sub.  I removed it, and permabanned the new account and the old account.   This is a violation of ethics and goes against proper reddiquette.  Now, there is nothing that I have to hide in that conversation, but as a mod I felt it right to keep my own personal thoughts to a PM, which he then tried to post.  

I know a lot of you know who I am talking about, but I won't name any names here.  I try to do my best to keep this sub on a very level playing field, as do all of us mods.  But I also pride myself as someone who acts fairly on reported posts.  Had this been an isolated incident we would forget it move on, but this had been brewing for some time.  My hope is that the matter is now closed.  If anyone has any questions or in any way feels that I have acted inappropriately please let me know - I am far from perfect and if I am wrong I want to know.

ecommerce,The steps I took to completely sell out of THIS product! So I wrote an eBook!,"Tell me about solutions, not problems!
This guide will help anyone who has little to ZERO dollars and want to sell tshirts online. The experience I will share is solely based off the success of our “Pretty Elephant” t shirt design which sold out in a week after releasing it via our online shop. This article will outline what we did from start to finish and how we managed to execute a marketing strategy with ZERO experience in the field. I will provide as many resources as I can from memory that will allow you to tailor this guide to your specific needs. Before we get into the meat of things let me start by sharing a story to set the tone for this guide

The Precursor:

My brand was without movement and progress for about 1 year before I decided to get up and start doing the necessary things for it to grow. There were times when I asked myself if this was really what I wanted to do being that I had a decent job and moving up in my company was and still is very achievable especially for a go-getter like myself. It took a close friend crying to me over a very deep phone call to boost my motivation enough to continue on with this brand. From that point on, I realized that the path to success is very clear – and very easy!

The problem was the brand was stagnant, there was little to no traffic to the site for months – and during that time, i didn’t really use any of our social media accounts to progressively stay current with our followers. I was definitely in a rut. The only pieces we released were the OG LOGO (logo changed after that) and the Au Gold t shirts. What was the correct way to rejuvenate a stale brand or for the sake of argument let’s ask “Why would anyone buy from our brand?”

The budget we had for any new release at that time was ZERO. During that time, I relocated to Philly with my company and spent all my resources (time, money, value) making myself more marketable to suit them. There wasn’t even enough money to pay for my website hosting. I lost all viable contacts and didn’t preserve any of our early relationships with printers, artists or customers.

The Change:

The reason I wanted to share that story was to give you an idea of where the state of the brand was and how possible it is to overcome and get back on track even if you tried, failed and failed some more. The point is that if you are trying to build your brand from scratch you will have more pitfalls than victories but the bigger the failure – the sweeter the rewards.

Remember, we had ZERO budget and some old designs stashed away from 2011. I still knew that I wanted to sell my tshirt design online

The good thing to note is that designs are only old to you if never released. I remember feeling like I was not succeeding because I didn’t have any fresh new designs to release but then I realized that you can pretty much use what you already have and make it work. PERIOD.

Before we continue to the selling aspect of this guide lets sidestep to the changes you have to make within yourself first. Ideas come to those who are open to receive, utilize and execute them with definitive actions behind it. It was this past June when I decided to take 100% responsibility for my thoughts and actions without complaining or blaming others for the circumstances I was in. Once I stopped complaining and saying things like, “This will never be what I want,” “I don’t have the money for a collection.” “Who is going to buy from us now” or “Is this design even good enough to release” – amazing things started to take shape in my personal life, which ultimately is a mirror reflection of my brand’s life.

Instead of focusing on the problems, I geared all my energy in allowing for positive solutions and as a result, I completely transformed how I think. I remember I would start believing in my brand and visualize an email that stated YOU OUR OUT OF STOCK – ALL ITEMS ARE SOLD OUT. I took the focus off of what others were doing to free up my mind space for my own personal and entrepreneurial goals. If you are visiting the websites of top brands in your market – just stop. They are not focused on you. If you look at them as competition then they are, but if you look at them as sharing space equally with you in a win-win situation then they will.

Tell your own story, and cultivate your own space.

The Solution:

After months (I changed myself so rapidly and in a short space of time, the energy and vibrations that I was receiving in the form of opportunities kept coming at a scary pace) of reading, writing out my goals, rebuilding my old network and re-branding Preferred Classics through the website’s content the solution came to me during a late night session at the gym.

I asked myself: What was stopping me from releasing a t-shirt RIGHT NOW, like today, like get the hell off this treadmill and get it DONE. The answers were blatant: no money, no marketing, no shirts, no printer, no packaging … endless. The answer that my new thought process came up with was that nothing is stopping me. The only internal or external thing that can stop you from succeeding is yourself, no one cares about you and your little brand as much as you do. Remember, the circumstances you are in were created by you. Therefore, nothing should stop you from doing whatever you want regardless of what the old negative mind wants to believe.

I quickly hopped off the treadmill because the answer came to me so intensely and so powerful, like a ton of bricks crashing and surely I wanted to experience it instantly. All this time after years of stagnation the simple piece to the puzzle was solved. This guide will explain exactly the steps I followed to not only release a t-shirt design but will also present the strategies I took to sell everyone of them.

The Outcome:

This past summer has taught me so much about being a great person and creating good in all that I do. This is why after many attempts to break down what Preferred Classics meant, I was finally able to create the brand’s identity when my own identity was aligned. I am forever grateful of the knowledge I gained during this time and although I am not an expert nor do I make millions from this brand (not yet =]) I am willing to share my experience so that it may speak to at least 1 person who may be seeking a guide such as this to continue following their dream and passion in order to validate their goals.

What feedback we've had from clients and people we've networked with have all been very positive but from the point of view of a online retailer it's been positive but limited, how can we make our website/service more appealing and what kind of thing would you be interested in seeing in the marketing from our company, offers?

I have a sourcing company in Shenzhen, China, where we focus on consumer products for the American and European market. 

After working for a product development and manufacturing company in Shenzhen for some time, I decided to start my own business helping people purchase directly from Chinese factories. 

I’ve negotiated with hundreds of factories, inspected factories in countless cities in China, had some incredible success with some suppliers, and also got screwed by others. 

I have a Chinese staff and a part-time American staff. I’ve been wined, dined and pampered by factory bosses and have learned some helpful tricks to stay ahead of the game.

ecommerce,What are some shared experiences for most e-commerce owners here? Do you get people who call just to ask how long it will take to ship even though it's on the website?,"I was just thinking about some common experiences we might have in common. Here are a few that I figure are pretty normal:

I get people who call to ask questions but don't really have any questions. I figure they are just making sure someone is behind the site and don't know what to say.

International customers often crack the same joke about how their package went to Canada via Miami.

I get people who call to place an order. I don't tell them that I am just typing their info into the website just like they could. I also don't mention that this method has a chance of backfiring if I can't understand them over their bad cell connection.


One I think I may be alone in is that I went out of stock on an item and left it out of stock for a long time. It's cumbersome to deal with and the per unit value was low so I drug my feet about re-ordering. I get an email one day saying ""Fuck you, you should close your store if you can't keep it in stock."" This item was about 1/50th of my yearly revenue.

ecommerce,Looking for a ecommerce solution that integrates with a database that's also used by a POS system in the actual physical store. Both would need to link to the same DB. Phone and web orders...

Retail store - walk in and online 

Need POS solution up front x2

E-commerce site for selling online (we currently have one with all our products)

Both the POS and E-commerce needs to feed off of and/or update one inventory database in realtime or a reasonable amount of time.

The E-commerce site must be able to update/show inventory down to color and site of product. For example, if we are selling black or red shorts that come in size M and L, we want the inventory of all 4 variables to be listed (or grayed out) depending upon our current stock… In other words again, each unique attribute possibility of the product must have it’s own inventory level. 

All systems need to interface with a mail system that’s able to print labels and stamps for USPS. 

In addition, we must be able to take and process COD orders, at least manually via a phone order. It would be nice to have that option on the website, but that’s secondary to the ability to take COD USPS orders via phone orders. I believe stamps.com has this function and ability, but would need to be added somehow at checkout

Speaking of phone orders, we would need a streamlined system to enter in phone orders and have said order update or interface with the inventory database and mail system so it can be shipped out. Possibly through the POS system in the front? At this time we are not concerned with UPS or FEDEX.


The ability to have wireless inventory hand scanners to scan items in the warehouse when new products come in.

My less than 2 hour research shows Quickbooks as the core, with another or QBs POS system up front, and stamps.com scales and other systems to deal with phone and website orders would be the way to go…",6,6,2014-11-27,ECOM,0.04147712513804436,0.9306525588035583,0.027870340272784233

I am looking into using Shopify for a client that has a fairly large and complex website, so using Shopify as the entire CMS is out of the question.  I've seen that external CMS platforms offer Shopify plugins so I know this is possible to a degree, but the Shopfiy docs are largely geared towards someone hosting their entire site on Shopify.

Obviously I can point a subdomain of my website to shopify for the shop portion, but I am wondering how theming works?  Our theme would live in our external CMS (concrete5).  I'm guessing it's impossible to replicate this in Shopify, as each time we update the theme in concrete5 we would have to update the theme in Shopify to match?",3,1,2014-11-28,ECOM,0.029957430437207222,0.936941921710968,0.03310059383511543

ecommerce,Multiple payment providers without needing an account for each one?,"I'm using Stripe and love it so far, but I'd also like to offer Paypal, Amazon Payments, Google Wallet, and perhaps a couple more options. Are there any services which offer a checkout flow for a number of different payment processors without requiring having an account for each one? So rather than me setting up and linking a number of payment accounts, a consolidated checkout provider would handle everything transparently for a reasonable fee. Accounting isn't my favorite aspect of my business, which is much of the reason I've kept to a single processor until now to simplify things for myself.",4,2,2014-11-30,ECOM,0.024259233847260475,0.9422339200973511,0.033506788313388824
