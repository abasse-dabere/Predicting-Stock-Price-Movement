We started branding in 2015 which really seems to help our marketplaces, but hasn't translated to Shopify just yet. Most of my Shopify sales are from direct traffic. I'd like to build up the Shopify channel via sales funnels and content marketing.

I want to build a funnel(s) to attach to my paid traffic campaigns on social and search. I'd like to include an upsell/downsell offer and qty discounts along the way.

I use Shogun app to build landing pages on my site for other purposes, but not sure it will create the funnel approach with upsell/downsell. I've tried zipify and didn't like the user experience and it was largely ineffective with my native traffic (maybe it would work better with paid funnel idk.)

shopify,Vote for the best tracking way you like!,"I'm thinking of running an online shop for a long time. So I did some researches and found something really interesting. One of the most important part of customer experiences, providing tracking information, there are so many ways to realize. I simply list the most common ways. Please feel free to let me know which is your type and why! I hope you can give me some advice about choosing the most suitable way for starters like me!

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Email &amp; tracking link of shipping companies**

I think that's what most people are using after sending packages to their customers. This email template must include

* The tracking link of shipping companies or other [3P tracking websites](https://www.trackingmore.com/) like trackingmore, parcelsapp, etc;
* The method to get tracking information within a certain website;
* Tracking number &amp; shipping company name.

It can be easily combined with email marketing. But I think it's still a little inconvenient because the tracking number of each order is different. So if there is a better tool to insert, for example, tracking number as liquid data. It will mean a lot.

**2. Track Widget/Button**

Aftership is very popular for its Track Button. But the color of their button can't be changed, so the bright orange button can't always fit the design of some shops, also the icon on the button. Then I noticed that trackingmore also has track button. Differing from aftership, I can change the color of the button to fit the design of my store. And they don't have the package icon, but it's just personal taste.

**3. Redirect Tracking Page**

In Shopify app store, it's easy to find many useful tools. As a code rookie, I think this is user-friendly because I can create [a unique tracking page](https://www.trackingmore.com/help_article-61-74-en.html) in minutes. Then I can add a new menu item named ""Track Order"" and insert this link. But it'll redirect people to a new page. So the customer experience isn't good enough. But it's enough for tracking, anyway. Trackingmore is a little complicated to use but I have to say that I like their features, it has everything. And they just updated their tracking page and added something that I really like. The button color of the tracking page, it can finally be changed! Also, they have HTML &amp; CSS editor.

**4. Embedded Tracking Page**

I recently found a new app called [Parcel Panel](https://apps.shopify.com/parcelpanel). One of the greatest things about this app is that it can generate an embedded tracking page! Check their example shop [here](https://parcelpanel.myshopify.com/)! I checked their instruction, it's simple and clear. It takes some time to finish the settings but it's worthy. And I think its ""Translation Strings"" is quite helpful for non-English speaker users. And it also has HTML &amp; CSS editor. Now, I wish I can write it someday. :(

&amp;#x200B;

The Track button is 100% free and sending emails is also an acceptable choice as a start.

In the long run, to make sure the customer experiences, I actually love the embedded tracking page. However, the customers can use their name or phone number to get the tracking information. But the embedded tracking page can't. So I don't know which part is more important.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple large companies off the top of my head are Gymshark and Kylie Cosmetics. Why would companies like these do millions of dollars in business a year forfeit over 2.4% of their revenue?

dropship,Quick Poll: Are you sourcing your own dropship vendors? Is there a need for an automation app?,"Hi everyone,

Need some help from the community.  

I successfully put together a dropship marketplace sourcing my own exclusive vendors who don‚Äôt normally dropship.  After a lot of hard work, I had a roster of amazing, hard to find indie brands, many of them never dropshipping before and doing it with me for the first time. However, when researching which order automation app to use I noticed that there was a gaping hole in the market for dropship retailers like myself building a brand and not wanting to use dropship marketplaces with cheap stuff like Oberlo.  

How does a merchant like me leverage the ease of dropshipping business model with my own handpicked vendors but automate how orders notifications are sent to suppliers, and marking the items as shipped with a tracking number  automatically sent to the customer so that it is all hands off? 

I used expensive third party apps like Ordoro that doesn‚Äôt have a sophisticated setup.  Ecomdash is another one that automates dropshipping but uses FTP to keep track of supplier inventory. 

So this made me question, are there others like me out there that don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with dropship marketplaces? If so, what solutions are out there to empower merchants to fully automate their catalog/order/inventory process so they can remove manual processes and focus on building more vendor relationships and marketing their business? 

We are now looking to take this pain point and develop an app for brand-driven merchants to automate catalog, order and inventory via Shopify API integration to use with high quality dropship vendors they have sourced themselves.  

Is this something that is needed?  Let me know what you think and sorry for the long back story.",3,6,2019-03-06,ECOM,0.05433822050690651,0.9196342825889587,0.026027429848909378

So, I have at the moment about $400 something dollars saved up that I want to invest in Dropshipping.

I have had a couple of stores in the past, one being a total failure and for one of them I ran out of funds and didn't make it to the break even point.

My biggest doubt is the advertising. One of my mistakes, as I think of it, was to only run one ad at a time, not more in an ad set, and only spent $5 a day.

The thing is, all I heard these days was ""you need at least $700-$1,000 to start Dropshipping nowadays"", ""you have to spend at least $20 per day to test products"", ""you have to test n products a day"", ""buy this course/programs"", etc.

dropship,Can I legally sell items from China to the U.S. that don't have their trademarks/patents registered in the U.S.?,"Hi there,

I'm new to dropshipping and I've set up my store/niche/brand. I have over 35 products listed and am close to launching advertising. However, my biggest concern with dropshipping is the potential of getting sued. 

From what I've read, a patent/trademark has to be registered in each country if it's to be legally protected in that country. What usually happens is a U.S. company will register their patent/trademarks in the U.S. and then turn to China for their manufacturing. Since the U.S. company failed to register their patent/trademarks in China, the Chinese manufacturer will take their product, manufacture, and rebrand it themselves to sell to China and other countries outside the U.S. and the company can't do anything about it legally. 

With all that being said, if I go to [www.uspto.gov](https://www.uspto.gov) and look up the Chinese company that I'm selling from and nothing comes up, implying they haven't filed their patent/trademark paperwork here in the U.S. Does this give me the greenlight to sell and launch that product with no legal consequences? 

If I'm distributing a Chinese trademarked item from China to the U.S., can I still potentially be sued? If that's the case, how do I find out if a Chinese company is trademarked?

I'm probably overthinking this way too much, but I just need clarification on this subject. I would be dead if for whatever reason I get into legal trouble. I could incorporate, but I read I probably shouldn't consider this until i become consistently profitable. 

TL/DR: Can I legally sell items from China to the U.S. that don't have their trademarks/patents registered in the U.S.? Could I get in trouble for distributing Chinese products from China to the U.S. where they aren't trademarked?

&amp;#x200B;

woocommerce,Is WooCommerce right for my project?,"Hi all, I am new to this community and I come to you regarding an e-commerce project that I need to work on. First of all, I have to say that I've no experience in Wordpress and WooCommerce but I have a year in PHP, Javascript and many other languages and frameworks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am unsure whether this platform is the right choice for this project or if I should code it myself in Vue + Laravel. Here's what I need to do:

&amp;#x200B;

I need an e-commerce website where there will be 2 products offered. The first is a sort of a test product where the user has to buy it then send it back (physically) where it will be analyzed and a custom product for the user will be created based on the data retrieved. A user must have an account in order to buy any of the products and the user can only buy the personalized product only after it has been created for them.

I need to enable login/register with social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.).

I need the admin side to display charts and graphs from external APIs. I need order tracking. Also, the site needs to be mobile-first.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the main requirements and I've spent a lot of time doing some research but I do not seem to know where to start from and which plugins to use, or code myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate some guidance or at the very least, valuable resources to learn Wordpress and WooCommerce from scratch so that I can make these things myself. All of the ones I've found do not show much other than how to actually configure these platforms with the options that come from them.

&amp;#x200B;

dropship,"Newbie getting into Dropshipping, need critique on my first store","Hey everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

As of yesterday I just created my first trial of a dropshipping store for smartphone accessories. I'm sure the market is probably plenty over-saturated, however I'm mostly trying to learn as much as possible right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The shop is called [AccessorEaze](https://drove.com/.Xdm) and I'm hosting it on [Drove.com](https://Drove.com) (free alternative to Shopify, actually very cool!) as of right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from the niche most likely being over-saturated, I'm mostly looking for critique on my inventory display, policies, branding, and anything between. Like I said - I'm very new to this venture and I want to learn as much as I can before investing anything into ads/paying for a Shopify account. Also, any tips and tricks as far as influencer/social media marketing and running ads would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much, I'm looking forward to the feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Somehow I woke up to a sale this morning, and despite my sloppy shop appearance, my confidence level for creating a serious store via Shopify has drastically increased. I'm loving all of the feedback on this and I appreciate every comment, so thank you all for continuing to check out my shop! I'd like as much feedback/advice as I can possibly get before investing some money into Shopify.",34,6,2019-03-13,ECOM,0.026238033547997475,0.9289230704307556,0.044838957488536835

dropship,Facebook Ads Optimization Checklist for Dropshippers,"Facebook Ads Checklist for Optimization

Split Testing

Nobody knows everything.  Although you have an idea of what copy and creative will resonate with your target demographic, you don't truly know until the data tells you.  Test copy variants and different ad types consistently in each audience until you get an idea of what is working. 

Placements

Facebook rewards you for using more placements.  Choosing placements for mobile only or desktop only is just wrong.  Facebook wants you to use 4 or more placements and many times automatic placements will perform best (even if your typical customer is usually found on Instagram). 

Dynamic Product Ads

If you have a product catalog, take advantage.  Dynamic Product Ads (DPA) are typical your best performers because you show people the products they have already looked at and added to their carts.  Just running an add to cart audience will not allow you to serve the exact products people viewed previously.

Advanced Matching

Advanced Matching is a new, simple feature that allows Facebook to get better tracking with your pixel and enable you to track conversions even when users are not logged into Facebook, using a private browser, or using a different device. To set this up, login to Events Manager and select your Pixel settings.  Under details, you can select Advanced Matching.  Using all the filters in Advanced Matching, Facebook's algorithm can use the datasets you've applied to make the best identification possible for the user and place them in the correct custom audience.

Differentiate Messaging

Someone seeing your brand for the first time needs to receive a different message than someone who has already added to cart, initiated checkout or already purchased.   Spending time crafting the appropriate copy &amp; creative elements to meet buyers where they are in the sales funnel.  When a message creates a compelling story 

Know When To Turn It Off

If you are testing an audience and not seeing a good return in the first few days, don't panic, these things take time! However, if you're letting it run for a month and seeing negative returns, turn it off.  Even if you thought it was your best audience, trust the data.

Creative For Each Placement

A new Facebook feature that allows you to change the asset at the ad level for each placement.  If you are running and ad on Facebook feed, Instagram feed, or Instagram stories it's important to use creative that is designed for each placement directly.  Allowing Facebook to manually crop each ad can look low quality and doesn't convert!

Landing Page Testing

Similar to ad type and copy testing, use different landing pages. You might think your home page converts well, but dedicating a landing page to a particular product may convert better.  

Use Google Analytics

First of all, always UTM tag your ads. This enables you to track it in Analytics and use the data to build custom audiences. Find what URLs people are spending the most time on and build custom audiences from them.

Video

Facebook LOVES video. So, invest in it. If you have been running static ads and carousels seeing little to no success, add some movement.  A 5-7 second GIF is going to drive more engagement than a static image, especially with people who are not familiar with your brand.

Campaign Budget Optimization

In September 2019, Facebook will be forcing all campaigns to use Campaign Budget Optimization. In the meantime, test it out.  This means optimizing at the ad set level instead of the ad level.  With Campaign Budget Optimization, Facebook will pick and choose which audiences to put budget towards when it sees something working. It can be a great way to test audiences without losing money on ads that weren't destined to be successful.

Competition View

You can now view ads from your competitors on their Facebook page (under Info and Ads). Take a look and emulate things you like about their ads.

Competition Target

Run ads targeting your competitors on Facebook and Instagram. If you're Nike you'll be targeting people who like Adidas, Under Armour, etc. Use what you know to your advantage and make your competitors customers, your customers.

Don't be scared

A lot of brands will test $500/mo, not see the results they hoped for, and give up. But it can take 2 months before seeing a positive return on ad spend (ROAS) It takes time and testing to understand what is going to work, so don't give up!

dropship,"I just got my first sale, thank you nice folks over here","I've just got my first sale for $49.99!, Overall I spent $8 in facebook ads, $2 in payment processing fees, and item itself was $20. So I got a nice little $20 profit out of this first sale :)

3 weeks ago I knew nothing about dropshipping other than how it works as a business model. First thing I did was to find if there is a subreddit for this over here, and when I found out that there was, I immediately came here and started to check the top posts of all time. I read about, 200-300~ threads, and then I went on to watch some random youtubers about things that I was unclear about. So this thursday I've opened a shopify account, I've edited and installed a good converting custom theme, and got some of the items in my niche that I knew people would buy into my catalog.

Started running ads last night, and surprise, when I woke up, I had 1 order for 50 bucks! I'm probably gonna wait for a week and look at the numbers, as well as make sure I'm getting my first payouts in my bank account before scaling the whole thing up by a decent margin.


Thank you guys, I've learned 70-80% of everything I know over here. I had decent previous experience running Google PPC ads, other than that I was a big 0 about e-commerce. Hopefully some of you guys with good performing stores keep providing advice over here, you should know that you're helping a student like me become financially independent!",12,17,2019-03-17,ECOM,0.02055109664797783,0.9088166952133179,0.07063217461109161

Hello everyone,

Always wanted to start my own small business and could never come up with an idea. After months of trying I thought I would keep it simple and try to sell t-shirts (no graphic design experience).

Anyways, I spent the last 6 hours making this store, making the designs, and just figuring out the message. I wanted to pick a niche and I really am into fighting climate change so I decided I'm going to donate a percentage of all my profits from each product to various organizations.

Anyways would love to get some feedback on my store so far. Let me know what you think!

dropship,Why Your Website is Probably not Getting Sales.,"This is to the people who have nothing on their product pages other than the product specifications and generic supplier photos. Then run $5 ads expecting to make a sale. 

Convince the consumer why they should buy your product. If your page is blank and just has a few pictures from the supplier, a name and only specifications not even a description. Trust me you will never make a sale online. You guys are expecting the product to sell itself. The only product in the world that‚Äôs really able to sell itself is cocaine, and you‚Äôre not selling cocaine, you‚Äôre selling cheap Chinese products. 

Add Reviews make people believe that they aren‚Äôt the only person in the world about to purchase from you. Which is what creates that untrustworthy feeling. Which is a feeling I get from most sites. I jump on the site and immediately feel like im the only person who‚Äôs ever visited this site. Put a plugin that shows that people are currently on the site. Put pictures of people using the same product so they don‚Äôt feel alone. 

Make some bs up about how long the battery lasts, or how cool it‚Äôll make you look. People want to buy products to make their lives easier or to make themselves look good. 

Also don‚Äôt even waste your time on adding products to your site that people can easily go to Walmart. They won‚Äôt do well and probably won‚Äôt make a sale. They can probably find it for a lower price than yours and its just a trip to their local Walmart instead of 20 day ePacket shipping. 

You guys have to add more. The people who currently have their websites like this definitely haven‚Äôt made a sale. I look through these websites and just shake my head. I could tell you guys are siting behind a laptop at home making these websites. Your job is to convince the people that the website was professional made at a corporate building or something similar. 

Most of the people on here are putting the least amount of work on their sites. You guys aren‚Äôt going to make a $1k a day like these. You guys don‚Äôt realize it but this is a job, when you open your store, you turn into a CEO. You‚Äôre the only one who makes the decisions to make a sale but just like in another other business you can lose money (paying shopify plan and not making sales or bad ad timing).  But you clock in the hours of work on your website, testing, product research and get your pay after you make your sales. And just like any other job, you‚Äôll learn and eventually you‚Äôll get good at it. Like all the youtubers and guru‚Äôs you see. They‚Äôve spent countless amount of hours, late nights and stress to get where there at now. People expect to go on YouTube and have the youtubers show them step by step how to make a sale. You guys have to test and test until you find something that works. 

You guys can actually make money from drop shipping. Drop shipping isn‚Äôt dead, you just have to be extremely creative. I see new brands popping up on my fb feed everyday, selling the same products, just a different brand. 

Also Branding, you have to convince your customers you‚Äôre an actual brand, and not some kid behind a computer like how I mentioned above. Be professional and creative on your ‚Äúabout us‚Äù page. Make up some story behind your brand. Talk about how passionate you were about your product and how you cared about the quality of the product. 

Also If you are afraid to spend a little money on apps to boost conversions, then i honestly think drop shipping isnt for you. You can‚Äôt expect to be successful if you cant spend a little money to improve your site. Like trust badges or timers or just useful and necessary apps for drop shipping. You guys already have the luxury of not having to buy the product until you make a sale. So dont be afraid to buy a few apps. 

Just want to include a quote from Jeff Bezos said about Amazon in 1999 -  ‚ÄúIf you can focus obsessively enough on Customer Experience, Selection, Ease of Use, Low Prices, and More Information to make **purchase decisions** with... If you can give customers all that plus great customer service, Then I think we have a good chance. And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to do‚Äù - The Richest Man in Modern History. 

Even to this day this model still works today in Dropshipping. The only way i would see drop shipping being dead is when maybe when there‚Äôs a system where they can create specific niche websites in a click of a few buttons. Because there‚Äôs systems where you can create ads and find winning products in seconds. Which is the hardest part. Imagine in a few years. 

And my final piece of advice that really helped me, alongside of me looking up dropshipping on youtube or google. Look up ‚Äúhow to sell online‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to convince people to buy products‚Äù, You will get a lot more useful information from business owners rather than gurus constantly trying to sell you their courses. 

... But until then I hope with this information you guys are able to go out fix your sites and bring home sales. 

PM me your site and ill able be happy to give you some advice and critique your store.",36,108,2019-03-18,ECOM,0.08680595457553864,0.8824438750743866,0.030750212259590626

ecommerce,"Store owners, thoughts on solving customer service difficulties?","I run a very small ecommerce business, doing about $500k/year. On normal days, we get maybe around 10-15 customer service tickets a day for a variety of things. During peak season, or new product launches, that number can increase to around 20-30/day. I also do some consulting for other online retailers, some of which getting 40-80 tickets per day, and one thing I've found across the board is that finding scalable support rep services is pretty difficult (cost, sourcing, training, consistent response times, etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

For most of the companies I work with (in the ecommerce space), they only really need text-based support (email, social, direct messages/chats, etc). Having spent a while now trying to solve some of these support issues within our own companies, one of the thoughts I had was getting together a productized service that basically offers scalable customer service for ecommerce-type online businesses that essentially handles all text-based customer service tickets in an all-inclusive monthly price (including onboarding, training, etc). We could guarantee 24-hour turnaround to all tickets.

dropship,"Started my store with $200 and did $25,000 so far in 2019","What's up! Just wanted to drop a story for people that feel like they haven't figured it out yet or don't think they have enough money to get started. (Just a note: this is how I started my business and doesn't mean it always works or that this is the only way. Just trying to share some info to help others out)

So I'm 23, have a full time job, and own 2 businesses; 1 of which is a dropshipping business that I started with just $200. Here is the initial break down of how I spent that $200:

\-$29: Shopify Plan

\-$5: to order 3 products from Aliexpress ($2.50 shipping, $0.80 per product)

\-Free: Set up instagram and Facebook Page

\-$6: Logo from Fiverr

\-$12: Domain

\-$148: Facebook ads

Here is a little background information about me and the prep before launching my store. I started by first business at 19 (4 years ago), I have never paid for a course, I have only either self taught or learned from research/youtube, I spent the better part of 3 months planning and learning to waste as little money as possible, I started a niche brand because its 10000x easier to target on Facebook ads than it is with a general store, I made my first sell within 8 hours of our first $5 Facebook ad, and finally I have reinvested every penny into the business that we have ever earned (still haven't taken a paycheck).

I'm not saying any of this to brag, I'm simply trying to help those who don't think they have enough money to get started and show that it takes a while to understand how this game of dropshipping works. Put in the time and research, build a clean niche brand, don't sell junk, sell useful products that can be used daily, and NEVER give up! Feel free to drop any questions below that you may have, I also have a youtube channel I just recently started (I'm not selling anything, just value).

So, I'm trying to decide which platform is the best for my needs but after googling a lot I still can't seem to decide, I'm a bit overwhelmed by the options. Right now I'm considering: Shopify, Prestashop, Woocommerce.

I'd rather start with a free platform(Prestashop or Woocommerce) but I understand that on the long term I'd have to buy plugins or add-ons so Shopify may be a good choice on ""value-features"".

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I think you may need to know about what I need to help me choose:

* I'm a web developer, I know you can develop addons for Shopify with his kind of language or feature ""Liquid"". Also this can help me with other paltforms. I read somewhere that Prestashop is migrating to Symfony, the PHP framework and right now I mostly work with PHP and JS.
* My budget for the ecommerce would be arround 5000‚Ç¨ (I'm from Spain). I understand it's not much but after I tell you what I'm going to sell maybe you'll think it's enough, or not, that's what I wanna hear! Waiting to save more is a possibility but I want to start this proyect as soon as I can.
* The products that I plan on selling are geek collecionism things like: Funko Pops, Other Figures, Merchandaising, Shirts (Like game of thrones, music groups, etc), Merchandising Cups, etc. Mostly things that you'd think as a gift for someone.
* The shop focuses on not having a lot of products (the shop's that I can see as my competition usually look like a bazaar with a ton of products like ""Dragon ball keychain"").
* As a web developer I want to enfatize a lot on a clean, fast design for the shop, going for a minimalistic look.
* I want the users to have an specific feature that may be hard to add to the shop. I want them to be able to have several ""Collections"". A collection is a list with an specific category. Let's say Funko Pops. The user can only add Funko pops to his ""Funko Pop Collecion"" and in that collecion he would see a list with all the Funko Pops added and a way to check the ones he has or hasn't bought still.
* If possible, I'd like to add to that feature the possibility so the user can ""subscribe"" so every month an item from that Collection that he hasn't bought yet it's send to him and an automatic payment it's done.
* In order to make it worth  for my customers to buy the Funko Pop, following the example, to me instead of buying it on Amazon, I'd aim for a most exclusive experience, with custom boxes with the logo of my shop and a note inside or a special kind of package as it's mostly a gift shop.
* I don't plan on having a lot of categories of products so by definition I don't think I'd have a lot of products either. I can't give you number because I'm still planning everything

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to add this!:

* My parents own an online shop about crafts &amp; arts, so I have the advantage that shipping cost are covered as an expense for me, bacause I can use theirs with my shop name. Same with hosting, I'd just need to buy the domain. My customers would have average shipping costs (probably around 3-5‚Ç¨ here in Spain) and would get their package in 24-48 hours

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is enough information for you to help me choose the right platform. I'd love to hear your feedback on what you think I might be doing wrong too.

what is the best practice for returns that has proven to work for you?

Currently, when someone isn't satisfied with an item (I'm selling T-shirts, incorrect size is always the reason) I tell them to send it back.

The easiest and safest way would be to wait until it arrives back to the warehouse from where I'd manually create a new order and send them the correct size.

However I need to make sure they pay the shipping (for the 2nd order).

So what I do is give them a 100% OFF and tell them to order the correct size from the store. So they only pay for shipping.

It can happen, however, that they just order the new one AND keep the old one as well.. which creates additional issues and needs my time and attention.

I'm sure there must be a better, fail-proof way to handle returns.",3,4,2019-03-21,ECOM,0.07024754583835602,0.8876341581344604,0.042118269950151443

I am using storefront, and I have 120 products, each has about ten products on average.

1) All the products within each sub-category have almost identical content, *except for size and price*. Is this bad for SEO? How do I solve this?

2) The categories and sub-categories are not very rich in content at all. In my admin area however I only have one field that I can fill with text, and as a result these categories and subcategories are very sparse, but if I chuck a load of content in there then my content gets pushed way down below the fold.

Seeing as I am writing duplicate content on my product page, and my category pages are all very sparse, would there be a use-case for the canonical tag or not? Where would I point this tag to?

shopify,Mailchimp to stop native Shopify support,"Just received an email with a link to this:

https://mailchimp.com/shopify-statement/

--

March 22, 2019

Yesterday, we asked Shopify to remove the Mailchimp for Shopify integration from their marketplace. We made this decision because Shopify released updated terms that would negatively impact our business and put our users at risk.

We also asked Shopify to leave the integration on for existing connected users through May 12, when the data sharing provisions of Shopify‚Äôs new terms take effect. We‚Äôre hopeful that Shopify will work with us to make this transition as smooth as possible for our shared users.

For months, we‚Äôve been trying to work with Shopify on terms that would be fair and equitable for both of our businesses. Throughout these negotiations, we refused to agree to terms that jeopardize our users‚Äô privacy and require us to hand over customer data acquired outside of Shopify. From our perspective, that's not our data to share.

The new terms also make it clear that Shopify wants to control which providers their partners work with and how they conduct their business. We believe small businesses are best served when they can choose which technology they use to run their businesses, which is why Mailchimp integrates with more than 150 different apps and platforms. We won't compromise on that just because Shopify sees it as a competitive threat.

Even though our native integration will no longer be available, our customers can choose from several third-party integrations to connect their accounts. We have a comprehensive set of resources available, including manual workarounds and a directory of experts for users with more complex needs.

We‚Äôre disappointed that we weren‚Äôt able to continue our partnership with Shopify, but our customers are our top priority.",43,58,2019-03-22,ECOM,0.03434034064412117,0.923402726650238,0.04225689545273781
ecommerce,"I have an Etsy shop, but I've heard that having a self-hosted shop (Shopify) in addition is beneficial. When is it worth it to make the leap? (Also, inventory management?)","Hi!

Right now I work my Etsy shop fulltime in addition to my other commissioned freelance craftwork, and I pay about $100 - $120 monthly in transaction fees on Etsy (not including shipping, which my customers pay). This seems fairly steep! If I were to open a Shopify, I'd pay about $30 monthly + Shipstation which is another $30, so $60 total. This is clearly lower but the obvious issue is that I'd be paying for both Etsy and Shopify at the same time, with the goal of moving traffic towards my Shopify to reduce my Etsy fees. I have a pretty healthy social media following so I'm confident that I'll be able to drive traffic towards my Shopify.

A lot of people operate both an Etsy and Shopify, but I'm just wondering at what point is it worth the leap, and is my business in a suitable place to start up that extra storefront? 

In addition, I'm worried about managing inventory between stores. My products vary between items with a limited stock (stickers, charms, etc) and custom made-to-order items with somewhat unlimited stock. I'd love software to sync the inventories of my two stores together but the options I've looked at are fairly pricey (at least another $30). I've heard that some people just split inventory between their shops? Any insight would be very welcome. 

In short, is it worth it?

EDIT
More info: I was a frontend web designer in a past life so I do have a website built with Craft CMS that serves as the info hub for my business, it just doesn't have e-commerce capabilities. By 'self-hosted' I meant mainly a shop that gives me more independence than Etsy does, since I've heard the horror stories about Etsy randomly shutting people down. 

EDIT 2: /u/ProudTechNerd recommended Ecwid which was the PERFECT solution. Basically a full shop that I could embed into my current website! I'm going to try out the ShippingEasy 30-day trial with their additional inventory management feature since it says it syncs inventory between my two shops (i hope!). So Ecwid is only $15/mo and ShippingEasy is an additional $29 + $14, so overall cheaper and more featureful than a shopify, AND it's on my current website.

shopify,"5 Shopify tips I wish I knew when I started, focusing on Shopify+Oberlo+AliExpress stack.","# Summary:

This is a small summary of some tips I wish I knew when I first started dropshipping. Most of these are obvious and many people will already be using them, hopefully at least one is useful for someone new!

# 1. Get verified early

What happened to us and a few friends is once you reach a high amount of sales Shopify will lock your withdrawals until you get verified. This can be a timely process, potentially a few weeks even. So I would be aware of this and try and kickstart the process sooner than later.

# 2. Avoid paying for bulk orders at a time with Oberlo

Using the Oberlo ""Pay for all orders"" function can have negative affects. If one order in the payment is cancelled for security reasons, every single order in the purchase will also be cancelled. This can be an admin nightmare, as you've got to re-process them all.

# 3. Use cashback

This is a lovely way to supplement your income - you've got to sign up to AliExpress portals or a third party affiliate network and then ask Oberlo to manually enable this configuration setting in the application, but once enabled you'll get somewhere in the realm of 6-8% cashback for all purchases.

# 4. Reward credit cards (e.g. American Express)

Using a reward card wisely can be highly beneficial. American Express gives 1 point for each ¬£1 spent, you can use these points for a huge range of rewards. For example in the UK around 20,000 points will get you a night at the Hilton - this works well with high spending FB ad accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course the APR is high on cards like this so you have to use them wisely - we pay off our card by bank transfer every couple of days to not incur any interest.

# 5. Be careful with PayPal

Whatever you think of PayPal it cannot be denied it converts highly - customers prefer it to entering their card details on a website usually their credentials are already saved and they can dispute payments with ease. **However**, PayPal do not work well with high volume dropshipping in most cases.

&amp;#x200B;

What tends to happen is that eventually the account is locked and you have to submit supplier details, after this they'll close the account and issue a **permanent ban.** My advice would be not to burn this bridge for short term success, perhaps re-introduce PayPal when your business grows and you introduce domestic delivery times.

I've uploaded all products with .csv file, they have status In Stock and it works good in Business Manager (with no errors when I upload except google product category which I don't have and that is not the issue because other account has the same setup and it works good).

dropship,Being Aware of Competition,"When working with general stores or products that are everywhere like amazon or walmart. Be aware of these stores. Be aware that people go out to walmart and see similar products. 

Say that you have a electronic niche general store, you have a cool charging dock for $26.99 

Say someone orders it thats cool you make the sale, full-fill the sale, have the supplier ship, and a few days later they cancel the order and demanding a refund because they found the charging dock at best buy for $12. 

And now you have to deal with the headache of solving this problem. Contacting the supplier and etc. They might even get hold of the your product and never open your emails. 

Ive had this happen to me multiple times and its a part of being a business owner. 

Sell uniquer products, show off the cool features that other products dont have, mention in your ad ‚Äòyou wont find a better deal‚Äô. Sell the product. Make them feel they have the advantage. 

So Tip of Day - Dont sell products that Walmart Sell for lower prices than yours. Make the prices a little more realistic. Better to have smaller margins than to have a headache like this.

dropship,5 Dropship tips I wish I knew when I started using Shopify+Oberlo+AliExpress,"# Summary:

This is a small summary of some tips I wish I knew when I first started dropshipping. Most of these are obvious and many people will already be using them, hopefully at least one is useful for someone new!

# 1. Get verified early

What happened to us and a few friends is once you reach a high amount of sales Shopify will lock your withdrawals until you get verified. This can be a timely process, potentially a few weeks even. So I would be aware of this and try and kickstart the process sooner than later.

# 2. Avoid paying for bulk orders at a time with Oberlo

Using the Oberlo ""Pay for all orders"" function can have negative affects. If one order in the payment is cancelled for security reasons, every single order in the purchase will also be cancelled. This can be an admin nightmare, as you've got to re-process them all.

# 3. Use cashback

This is a lovely way to supplement your income - you've got to sign up to AliExpress portals or a third party affiliate network and then ask Oberlo to manually enable this configuration setting in the application, but once enabled you'll get somewhere in the realm of 6-8% cashback for all purchases.

# 4. Reward credit cards (e.g. American Express)

Using a reward card wisely can be highly beneficial. American Express gives 1 point for each ¬£1 spent, you can use these points for a huge range of rewards. For example in the UK around 20,000 points will get you a night at the Hilton - this works well with high spending FB ad accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course the APR is high on cards like this so you have to use them wisely - we pay off our card by bank transfer every couple of days to not incur any interest.

# 5. Be careful with PayPal

Whatever you think of PayPal it cannot be denied it converts highly - customers prefer it to entering their card details on a website usually their credentials are already saved and they can dispute payments with ease. **However**, PayPal do not work well with high volume dropshipping in most cases.

&amp;#x200B;

What tends to happen is that eventually the account is locked and you have to submit supplier details, after this they'll close the account and issue a **permanent ban.** My advice would be not to burn this bridge for short term success, perhaps re-introduce PayPal when your business grows and you introduce domestic delivery times.

shopify,Beginners Guide to Learning Facebook Ads | NO COURSE,"So I‚Äôve been helping and mentoring a lot of people on Facebook ads recently and the most common question seems to be, ‚ÄúHow do I start?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat course is best for beginners?‚Äù I personally have never purchased a course and have done over $25,000 in revenue in 2019 alone (not a brag, just validation). I still have a full time job and run my business on the side as of right now but I have put together what I believe is the best way to learn Facebook ads for complete newbies or even beginners and it is 100% FREE.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start with this video by Kevin David:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6ATUw0BIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6ATUw0BIU)¬†(if you are already slightly familiar with FB ads then skip this step). I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Kevin David because he is the exact stereotype of a ‚Äòguru‚Äô with his flashy car and videos that rarely have value until you buy the course BUT this is the best 1 hour video I have found to really understand the overall basics of the platform.  
 
2. Take the Facebook Blueprint course. I‚Äôm not sure why it seems like no one talks about this but Facebook has a FREE TRAINING COURSE on Facebook ads. It doesn‚Äôt get much better than Facebook themselves telling you how to run ads. Now this takes a long time to get through and is very boring but this is a great step two if you are on a low budget and are ready to start spending money just yet.¬†[https://www.facebook.com/business/learn](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn)  
 
3. After you know the basics with step 1 &amp; 2, turn to YouTube. \*Shameless plug - yes I do have a channel but I honestly am not selling ANYTHING. No pressure, if you want to check it out here is a link:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN269jnpf4kVQzO37fZsKHQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN269jnpf4kVQzO37fZsKHQ)¬†\* YouTube creators have put out so much content that there is absolutely NO need to buy a course. It may be a cleaner guide to getting started but for $297-$2997 a course just isn‚Äôt worth the money. Use that money testing on Facebook instead. Some of the best channels I recommend are: Gabriel St-Germain, King Comm, Tristan Broughton, Alex Djordjevic, and Arie Scherson. (Also mine, Startup Astronaut¬†[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN269jnpf4kVQzO37fZsKHQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN269jnpf4kVQzO37fZsKHQ)). A few of these guys are selling courses, but their free content and free facebook groups are more than enough.  
 
4. Start testing. You can never fully understand Facebook ads until you really start doing them yourself. After steps 1, 2, and 3 it‚Äôs time to start spending some money. Go for it.  
 

Seriously, there is no need to buy a course and never buy a course from someone who is ‚Äúselling a guru course for cheap‚Äù. The main value of courses is access to a private facebook group which you don‚Äôt get if you buy the cheap version.

dropship,Daily Dropshipping Tip of the Day #3,"**This tip might not come in handy right until at the end of your shopify career, or it might never come in handy at all but it's nice to know at the start....** trust me on this one ;)   


Today's tip of the day = *Instal google analytics as soon as possible*. If you ever come to sell your website, the value will come 100% from the google analytics stats, serious buyers typically give no credit to shopify stats and go 100% off google analytics.   


I know this because I was selling 2 year old website once, but I only installed google analytics after one year, **EVERYONE** I spoke to would only value it from the day it starting being registered on google analytics. It made it hard to find a buyer because people wasn't sure if I just a lucky year or not, when in fact sales were consistent over two years.   


It's also handy if you move from shopify to wordpress, as this way you don't lose your stats, you keep them all in google analytics and then they even continue onto your wordpress (or other) website.  


You might not have any intention to sell right now, or move away from Shopify, but you never know what life might hold for you, shopify could decide to ban you at anytime (also happened to me) so do yourself a favour, if you haven't already, install google analytics, install it now.

After that, I will also tell you another fib and claim I make 7 figures every month just by following these simple rules! 

On top of that I‚Äôll finish the video ad by claiming I only do this because I want everyone to be rich. The reality is though I film my YouTube videos out of my Mums bedroom because I still live with her and am up to my neck in debts trying to peddle this scam.  I also think that because I figured out how to create a video Facebook ad it makes me smarter than all of you.

I've been lurking the sub for a little while, and like many people here, I am very interested in getting started up in dropshipping.

I've been dedicating a lot of my time recently in becoming as knowledgeable as possible in the area of ecommerce and digital marketing to become as familiar as possible with the process.

I think it would be beneficial to build a network of other dropshippers, whether newbies or more experienced. That way we can bounce ideas, answer any questions and exchange the most up to date information.

I am UK based myself, so it would be interesting to hear from others who are UK based too! But regardless of where you are located in the world, it would be great to hear from you.

shopify,3 Important Ecommerce Customer Experience Trends You Must Follow In 2019,"If you want to check out a easier to read version or my other blogs you can find them on my medium page here [https://medium.com/swlh/3-important-ecommerce-customer-experience-trends-you-must-follow-in-2019-ab47efbf67f8](https://medium.com/swlh/3-important-ecommerce-customer-experience-trends-you-must-follow-in-2019-ab47efbf67f8) 

It‚Äôs hard to believe we are already a quarter of the way through 2019 but this means we already have some great insight on what eCommerce trends are performing well in 2019 and reasons why you should be following them. What 2019 has taught me so far is the only way to maintain direct and close connections with customers is by:

1. **Having original content is crucial for growth and success.**
2. **Having a conversion optimization strategy that does not undercut brand value is extremely important.**
3. **Conversation commerce through Chat, Messenger and SMS is the way of the future.**

Each of these topics could be articles on their own but I will summarize each one into some main points to help you grow and scale your business in 2019.

## 1) Commerce+ Content

Brands can now scale profitably by serving smaller niches comparatively to much larger competitors who serve a larger set of people (think of a store that sells TVs, computers, video games and headphones compared to a brand that just sells headphones). Being able to serve small niches is the big advantage of selling directly to the consumer which can now be easily done by having a strong online presence. It‚Äôs no secret that content has the power to sell but knowing how to utilize the full potential of content is extremely important if you want to grow your brand. A big mistake a lot of merchants make is they try and use content in a direct way to sell to their customers, if you are doing this STOP, because I can guarantee that you are not utilizing the full potential of your content. The power of content comes from exciting and energizing your audience eliciting emotions from them through a consistent well told story.

Hopefully I‚Äôve now made it clear to not just post meaningless content to try and sell, but you are probably asking yourself well how do I create the right kind of content that turns my audience into buyers? It may be easier said than done but you want to think of ways to create stories about people not your products, and direct these stories at your audience, or make them about your audience or even have your content created by your audience (user generated content is very important). By selling the story of your brand and coming up with clever ways to include your audience you will find your content will become much more engaging and this will turn your audience into buyers naturally instead of forcing sale driven content at your audience that they can‚Äôt relate with or engage with.

There are tons of ways you can make this type of content, whether it‚Äôs through your blog or a YouTube/Instagram channel, you can even achieve this through traditional marketing techniques like radio ads. Just make sure before you dive into trying out these methods that you have a planned-out strategy, don‚Äôt wing it and hope something works because 90% of the time it won‚Äôt. Think of ways to tell your brands message through different platforms and how you can use each platform in different ways. Also make sure to have your content planned out and measure the actual results driven by this content. A huge mistake by many companies is they make all this content and then don‚Äôt even take the time to report on how well its performing.

## 2) Conversions that don‚Äôt sacrifice your brand¬†value

In order to grow your business, you always want to be thinking of new strategies that will increase your conversions, but you need to be careful that you aren‚Äôt sacrificing brand value when coming up with new strategies. You want to make sure that as you increase your conversions you still maintain brand equity (brand equity is the value of a brand determined by consumer perception and experiences with the brand: awareness, recognition, trial, preference and product loyalty). So how do you achieve higher conversions without sacrificing brand value?

Studies indicated [62% of consumers](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/Brand-purpose?fbclid=IwAR1DxauEd8Rum1V0ZvzgKL8Fb0EcC5AovZy7dPMx8pcOQz6BXkRK_ZGs8N4) want their brand to take a stand on relevant cultural issues and [52% of consumers](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/Brand-purpose?fbclid=IwAR1DxauEd8Rum1V0ZvzgKL8Fb0EcC5AovZy7dPMx8pcOQz6BXkRK_ZGs8N4) say both their initial purchase and their loyalty heavily depend on a company‚Äôs commitment to something bigger than just products and services. Statistics show brands with a high sense of purpose have a valuation increase of 175% compared to brands with a low sense of purpose whose valuation sits at 70%. In late 2018 many large brands (and leaders in the ecom world) offered no holiday discounts, very limited discounts or charity-based incentives, why? Because just giving out discounts all the time can hurt and lower brand value.

In the past few years using discounts has been a proven method used repeatedly by many brands to help improve conversions, if done correctly this method still works really well but if done poorly this can really hurt your brand‚Äôs value. So, does this mean discounting is a thing of the past? Absolutely not, it just means you must come up with better strategies to implement discounts without sacrificing brand value. A great example of this is using a tiered discount strategy, this strategy lots of time combines free gifts and discounts for hitting target-based goals. For example, ‚Äúadd $100 of products to your cart and get X-gift + free shipping‚Äù and then your next tier could be ‚Äúadd $200 of products to your cart and get X-gift + Y-gift + free shipping‚Äù. To tie this all together you will want to make sure you have a great strategy in place for how your customers can add everything to their cart and get the free gifts in the least number of steps and you want to make it clear and easy to see how close they are to hitting the goal of the tiered discount.

## 3) Conversational Commerce

Email marketing is still the dominant choice for pre-purchase marketing and people still are looking for transactional and post purchase emails in their inbox. A new form of conversational commerce has recently become very popular and has been showing some great results. Conversational commerce refers to onsite chat, direct messaging through chat, Facebook Messenger chat or SMS. If you aren‚Äôt already using one of these chat methods or haven‚Äôt started to think how you might be able to implement these chat methods on your store you aren‚Äôt preparing yourself for the future. The best way you can utilize these messenger features is through your sites support, as I‚Äôm sure you know as your store grows customer support efficiency usually decreases which can have negative outcomes on your store‚Äôs growth. Not only can these messenger features help keep your customer support efficiency up, but you can have personal engaging conversations with your customers who reach out to you and provide them with content, knowledge and expertise to help them complete their purchase and provide a great experience.

shopify,Oberlo vs Shopified,"Ok, I didn't want to start with AliExpress because of shipping times but I had a really bad experience with Modalyst, Shein and Wish and I just have to start from the basics. I'm gonna have to Ali for a little bit until I get the basics. My question to you is should I use Oberlo or Dropified as my intermediary?
Seems like the consensus over the years has been Oberlo, they are certainly more ubiquitous. Recently, though it seems as if Dropified has been taking some swings. Their automated fulfillment process alone seems amazing once you find that winning product.
I don't think Dropified does curation, though, just gives you seller stats. 

So do any of you have experience with both...or either...or just Dropified? Honestly I'm a little leaning into Dropified as I have been following their 60 day challenge, and while not the greatest presenters at all, so much valuable info and for free.  This program really re-wired my brain and I appreciate that, so I want to support them. But I most of all wanna make money with the least problems possible.

shopify,Shopify broke up with Mailchimp? WTF,"Mailchimp Statement About Shopify Partnership

via: https://mailchimp.com/shopify-statement/

&gt; March 22, 2019
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, we asked Shopify to remove the Mailchimp for Shopify integration from their marketplace. We made this decision because Shopify released updated terms that would negatively impact our business and put our users at risk.
&gt; 
&gt; We also asked Shopify to leave the integration on for existing connected users through May 12, when the data sharing provisions of Shopify‚Äôs new terms take effect. We‚Äôre hopeful that Shopify will work with us to make this transition as smooth as possible for our shared users.
&gt; 
&gt; For months, we‚Äôve been trying to work with Shopify on terms that would be fair and equitable for both of our businesses. Throughout these negotiations, we refused to agree to terms that jeopardize our users‚Äô privacy and require us to hand over customer data acquired outside of Shopify.
&gt; 
&gt; Our shared users have complete control over their own data. By continuing to connect with Shopify through third-party integrations, we‚Äôre providing our shared users with the choice to share that data going forward. What we‚Äôre not willing to do is automatically and retroactively share all of this data with Shopify, including data acquired outside of and not connected to the Shopify platform, without the user involved. From our perspective, that data belongs to our users and isn‚Äôt ours to share directly with Shopify.
&gt; 
&gt; The new terms also make it clear that Shopify wants to control which providers their partners work with and how they conduct their business. We believe small businesses are best served when they can choose which technology they use to run their businesses, which is why Mailchimp integrates with more than 150 different apps and platforms. We won't compromise on that just because Shopify sees it as a competitive threat.
&gt; 
&gt; Even though our native integration will no longer be available, our customers can choose from several third-party integrations to connect their accounts. We have a comprehensive set of resources available, including manual workarounds and a directory of experts for users with more complex needs.
&gt; 
&gt; We‚Äôre disappointed that we weren‚Äôt able to continue our partnership with Shopify, but our customers are our top priority.

shopify,How to NOT suck at Dropshipping,"Specifically Shopify dropshipping.

1- Before you even sign up for Shopify, find a niche. Yes, you can make money off of general stores. Yes, single product stores are easier to manage. Don't do EITHER of those things when starting out.

2- Once you've established a niche- let's say electronics and smart devices- go to AliExpress, and find at least 6 ""winning"" products(you'll want to open them in new tabs). A winning product is a product that:

a. isn't readily available in stores

b. serves a specific function and solves a problem

c. is something people don't see everyday, often something they didn't know they wanted until they saw it.

3- Once you've done that, sign up for Shopify, set up your payment method(s), build a SIMPLE store- nothing flashy, you're just starting out. Many people over-emphasize the importance of the website. People want a clean, simple design, that let's them get to the product as fast as possible. You'll want to direct them to the product, and by extension, the checkout page A.S.A.P. If done right, it shouldn't take you more than a few hours. No coding involved. Add the products to your store via Oberlo.

4- Write product descriptions for each one. Keep it simple, for now. One paragraph is more than enough. If you wanna be the cool kid, you can use a bulleted list. I recommend 4-5 points to focus on. Whether you're using a paragraph or list, it's important you answer these two questions: 

a. What can your product do? 

b. How does it help your customer (solve a problem)?

5- Now it's time to test your products. Use Facebook ads and link that to your Instagram account for maximum exposure. I recommend 20$ to start, but if your budget is tight, go for 10$ per day per ad. Look up a few popular FB ads to see the general format, and copy that. Usually, two short sentences about the product, what it does+ one more that includes a limited time ""offer"" (free shipping, 20% off for x hours, a discount code etc). There are others, of course, but these are the ones you should stick to when starting out. Don't overwhelm yourself.

6- Let those sit for 2-3 days. Pick products that sell the most (yay you're already getting sales!) and use an Instagram Influencer to drive the point home. You'll usually have to send the product over to them (that works best, but you could always ask them to just advertise the product via your website). They'll usually ask a fee, be ready to spend at least 50$ per Influencer. BE CAREFUL. Some so called influencers have fake followers. Whenever you want to advertise with one, take a good look at their bio. If they have, let's say, a YouTube account, that's a good way of knowing they're legit. Otherwise, Google their name. See what they've accomplished in their life- their reach, so to speak.

7- Make more money off the Influencer's ad. Include a limited time offer (like you did with FB) to create a sense of urgency. You want customers to be like ""OMG, I need this NOW"". Not, ""Oh, that looks cool... maybe I'll get it later""

I have worked in the international business for nearly a decade but only in B2B field and my previous job was selling chemical products, so it's quite different with the dropship thing.

Another issue is that I'm in China, quite easy to find whatever products needed (and of course I will strictly control the quality ).

But the problem is

1. What kind of the product will you guys (people out of China) would like to buy from online and willing to wait at least 15 days?
2. if I set up an online store based on wordpress, how should I promote to get the customer? My previous job let me attending local Expo and visit Clients and talk to them face to face, so i'm not so good at online marketing.

ecommerce,Dealing with friendly fraud,"I have a customer I suspect is trying it on to get free products. They ordered 2 items and we sent the wrong variant (fragrance) but they also claimed the products were lacking the actual fragrances. This is very odd as all items are packed together and the shipping weight would have been much less. 

Anyway we sent out 2 new correct items the following day - I packed the items myself to check and send on. Now the customer is claiming that both new items have arrived leaking. This again very odd and unusual. We've never had these items missing pieces and we've never had them leak, until now. They asked for a full refund.

I asked for photo's and said we can refund once the items are returned to us, we can supply the pre paid postage and refund once back. They kicked off about this.

24 hours later I get pictures through saying the pictures are from opening the boxes initially. I checked the meta data of the images and they were taken 24 hours later. The photo's look unauthentic to put it politely. It's like they've just splashed water over the images. The products wouldn't have leaked like this as they are well packaged and they wouldnt still be wet 24 hours later!

Any other day I would just refund and move on but it grates me. Both incident's are so unusual and the photos are manufactured.

shopify,Mix dropshipping with physical stock,"Hello,

Would you know a stock management and shipping solution a bit special. Mixing Dropshipping with Oberlo and Physical Shop.

I would like to offer 2 types of deliveries for the same product. It is the customer who would choose.

\- Either Shipping from France with extra cost  
\- Either Shipping from China via Oberlo, free

A priori, if a product is managed by Oberlo, it prevents to define Locations managed by Shopify, and thus to choose different modes of delivery.

Would you have an idea to be able to offer several types of deliveries, and ""give the hand"" to Oberlo if the chosen delivery matches?

Finally Oberlo or other similar solution.

Thank you
