ecommerce,Do many people use your site search?,"My boss is suggesting we remove certain parts of our menu (slimline it) as ""we already have a search box"".

Trouble is, our analytics from the past 3 months show just 11% of people visiting the website use the search box. It certainly surprised me as it's the way I use almost every ecommerce website that I visit.

Also, 10% of people actually start from the front page of our site; others land on a product or page through Google and other external websites then use our menu to navigate around. The boss wants to reduce the menu, make the search more prominent and introduce some flashy graphics on the front page - despite our analytics showing that 90% of our website users probably won't see them.

I can deal with this myself, I'm just interested in seeing what other's website stats are for their front pages and site searches. I expected the landing stats since 75% of our traffic comes from Google, but the site search shocked me a little.",12,9,2015-10-01,ECOM,0.29745617508888245,0.6801976561546326,0.022346114739775658
ecommerce,eCom Platform w/ Most Flexible/Functional Shipping,"I am looking for an ecommerce platform with the simplicity and functionality of BigCommerce, but that also understands the intricacies of shipping.

For example:

**Can I add a default or starting cart weight to take packaging into account, or can I set the weight cutoff by shipping service?**

This is incredibly important on smaller items that *could* go First Class Mail in smaller quantities, but occasionally sell in much higher quantities.

When the cart only takes the product weight into account, you end up paying for Priority when the customer only pays for First Class.

When you pad the product weight as a work around, the weight on higher quantities skyrockets.

**Can I set certain items to *Call for Pricing*?**

At the other end of the spectrum, LTL truck freight is tough to calculate at the cart level, as are some shipments to Canada, Hawaii, or Alaska. For those products, I'd like to get the customer on the phone.

**Does the platform handle dimensional weight at all well?**

Item one ships normal, item two ships normal, but item one plus almost any other item jumps to dimensional weight.

Anyway, is there anyone out there with more challenging shipping that has found an awesome platform, with solid adaptive templates, decent support, and a shipping solution so robust it can handle whatever you throw at it, without a lot of custom coding?",18,7,2015-10-01,ECOM,0.03694649413228035,0.9293673038482666,0.033686134964227676

ecommerce,Ecommerce CAnada - using US third party fulfilment center and US Sales tax compliance for Canadians,"Hey guys,

Is anyone shipping to US clients (consumers) from Canada? Are you shipping directly from a Canadian location or from a third-party US fulfilment center? 

I'm looking at starting an ecommerce site that will also have US consumer clients however I can't seem to understand the sales tax compliancy issue - this is only if I use a US fulfilment center. If I ship from Canada, I don't have to deal with sales tax to US customers, but deal iwth high Canadian shipping costs which will scare of a large percentage of my US customers.

Your recommendations and help please?

ecommerce,Advice for a single dad.,"Please be helpful as possible. I want to start my own ecommerce site. I have sold on ebay and amazon before. (trading cards and other random things. Making around 500ish a week) i turned that into my own website with shopify. I used facebook ads and adwords. No sales. I had visitors but no sales. I think it was just too small of a niche. (one particular kind of trading card) 

My ideas and interests for a new start up are:

1. E cigs and vapor (some obvious legal obstacles with selling nicotine that I would have to overcome.) Easy to make e liquid and has good margins from what i have saw. I don't smoke but the town i live in adores these things. 

2. Toys. The highest category of sales on amazon. Why not? I have a daughter and this just seems fun.

3. Teen to adult women's clothing. Stylish clothes. Such as leggings, bikinis, shirts, jackets, pajamas, etc. Good margins and great sales. Could also use printful to make my own brand and clothes.

4. T-shirt company. This market just seems saturated as can be. 

Things preventing me from starting: 

Not sure which to do first or if any.
Little to no capital.
Would most likely have to be a ""just in time"" business model where when i get an order i would then order the product.
Not sure what platform to use. (wordpress woo commerce shopify open cart big commerce etc)
No logo. (Mostly deciding on niche is holding this back)
Not sure how to advertise.
Not sure what to do first.
Should i use amazon and ebay with these?
Would have to learn some marketing, SEO and how to use CRM tools. (doesn't seem too hard just still picking one is preventing this)
Possible partner?

Positive things.

I have quite a bit of time to work on this.
I have some names in mind as well as themes.
I have quite a bit of knowledge on these things just not great at the first step.
I do tons of research and reading on marketing, startups and other business related articles.
I am very creative and get really into these things. 
I am young so I have a little bit of extra energy. 
I am 21 and I'm a single dad.
I recently lost my job due to missing too much for court to getting custody of her.
I have a little saved up and unemployment right now but I don't like the situation I'm in at all.
I would love to home school my daughter. (She's just 1 now.)

ecommerce,New guy in the jewelry waters..,"So I've recently started a website that generally sells handmade jewelry products. Done most of it my self (Apart from the bit where everything is done using bigcartel platform). I'm okay with the bits they offer for code access and such, already implemented some of the structured data, have a facebook,twitter, G+ pages/accounts I get the visits (Not much, around 30~ per day) and some interest yet no sales. The site is minimalistic but suits to exactly what I was expecting. (As in looks) I'm gaining most of my traffic from social media platforms as I don't do any paid adverts or anything like that. It was mainly done as a fun web dev project and it somehow turned out to be my main focus for a while now.

The website is jewelltry.com so any advice, tips or insight would be very much valuable. As I am just starting out and trying to plan my next steps. Making at least some weekly sales would be amazing, so far that does not seem to be happening.

woocommerce,Best way to handle a product attribute that is also available as a stand alone product,"Hi all, looking for some advice on how to best setup the product taxonomy for a client. The store will be selling fishing lures (spinnerbaits), and the client wants to offer pre-made lures, custom lures (customer selects the weight, blade colour, blade type, blade configuration and skirt style), and individual lure skirts.

There are currently 40 different skirt colours/styles, 2 blade configurations, 2 blade types, 3 blade colours, and two jig head weights.

I had started off splitting the custom lures into 4 variable products, with the weight and blade configuration set, then leaving the blade type, blade colour and skirt style as variations (presented as swatches). I did this to reduce the number of variations per product (for performance reasons), and as I feel it is a logical experience for the customer to be selecting the weight and configuration up front.

ecommerce,Request for store review,"Hello All, 

I would appreciate any feedback on my recently launched ecommerce store [broccasion.com](http://broccasion.com), which specializes in personalized men's gifts.

While I have driven some traffic, I have not made any sales.  My goal was to launch a dropshipping business on Shopify as quickly and cheaply as possible to learn about the process and abandon my ""paralysis by analysis"", as I had been lurking Shopify content / forums and these types of subs for years.

My assumption is that my lack of sales is due to some combination of overall pricing, less than ideal shipping rates or a niche that's too broad; however I'm also aware that I may be missing something more straight forward or glaring.

Although the learning experience was wonderful, I need to determine if I should keep driving more **targetted** traffic to the store, or take what I have learned and apply it to a more narrow niche.

I appreciate your time.

dropship,How to know if i got a profitable niche?,"Hey reddit,

im looking for a startup ecommerce business that I can run in my country.  I would like to have a own webshop, but nowadays its very complicated to come up with an idea... I already used tools like adwords, but i don't come any further.. 

I looked at some keywords and have written down the most interesting ones.. But which of these are interesting enough to look further? And how do i need to analyse further?

ecommerce,Launching international jewlery site and could use some feedback/constructive criticism! Especially with regards to pricing.,"I moved from Texas to Australia with my partner a few months ago and have been trying to get my website off the ground while here. It's been on hiatus while I get it up and I've just now opened it up publicly to hopefully get some feedback! Brand new to ecommerce so any help is appreciated. [](www.whitestagforge.com)

I do pretty well in person with my jewelry- usually can expect $700-$1000 in 2-4 hours at pop up shops and my prices run $10/30/35/45 so it's got some nice volume moving hand to hand.

But prices here are 30% higher with the dollar conversion, and looking at them I can't believe that anyone would pay that for jewelry. I know, I know.. it's my business. But it's hard to justify.  My main competitor uses some of the same materials and sells her pieces at $150-300 which floors me. I should get over this mentality if I'm going to succeed.

I just like making this stuff and seeing it on people. I DON'T want the brand to be perceived as cheap. But I do want expensive looking jewelry to be accessible to everyone. I'm just unsure of how to get there.

I'm pretty hard on my site and products in general and am nervous about re releasing it but I it has good potential in the right market. What do you guys think?

* what do you think of the layout, would you change anything?

* how do the prices seem? is there anything that you think is too high or low? any guidance on what price points you think would work best? this is my WEAKEST area.

* are there any pictures that jump out at you as being out of place or bad photoshop? is the white off putting or bland? anything you'd rather see, like larger images for the thumbnails?

* anything else I'm totally missing?

There's still some work to be done on the site before the real launch so if something is really off chances are it's on my list.",5,2,2015-10-06,ECOM,0.03306499123573303,0.921979546546936,0.04495544359087944
ecommerce,One-man team and feeling underwhelmed. Have you been here before?,"Recently launched an eCommerce store. Most of my time has been - and still is - working on adding products to the site's catalog. It's a daunting process and takes an hour and fifteen minutes per product - on average - to collect the data (specifications, features, etc), format it, write a unique description, download/resize/rename images and then implement SEO. 

Because of this, a lot of the sales-oriented stuff such as marketing and writing SEO content has taken a back seat and not much headwind has been made. Making things more difficult, I have a 9-5 which is my bread and butter and am married with kids so I am not able to really work on the site until after they are in bed around 8 at night, by which time I am exhausted myself.

Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation? If so, how did you cope? I am bringing on a partner and looking forward to sharing the responsibilities but he is in the same situation I am in. Thoughts?

ecommerce,Any good suggestions for an online storefront? Done with Weebly at this point.,"I currently use Weebly to manage the website and storefront (storefront is not up yet) for a cafe, and despite already having a paid (overpriced) pro plan they want to charge me more just to CREATE products for the store...not even list them (only 25 store products for pro...there are more than 25 coffee options!). I'm done with weebly. They were awesome when they first launched, I loved the simplicity they brought with the whole drag and drop style interface. Unfortunately their continual rate increases are pushing me to the point where I'm losing money and I can no longer continue to use their service.

Are there any good online storefront alternatives? If I have to rebuild the site to migrate hosts, I'm not afraid of doing that. I'm also not afraid of a learning curve either. I just want to get out of weebly for good and was hoping some redditor wisdom could help point me in the right direction. I know it may be a bit hopeful to try and find an all-encompassing package like the one that came with weebly, but it is simply not going to be profitable for me to use them right now.

* What do you hate about it?
* What features in the platform are critical to run your online business?

* How do you charge for taxes and shipping? Do you set the rates manually or use some live calculations via apps/APIs?
* What payment options do you offer?
* What have been the most effective tactics for you to attract customers and grow your business online?
* What do you do for online branding and promotions  (e.g. Display ads, blog, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc)?

ecommerce,Quick View Modules - has anyone ever tested their value?,"I see these on almost every prominent ecommerce product browse page nowadays.  Mostly they are usually just a pop up module of the product profile that opens on the same page.

I would think the greatest advantage would be cutting down on the time/clicks flipping through pages.  However, its usually not that much more time to simply click on the link.  

Has anyone seen an increase in conversions when they implemented a ""quick view""?  Or is this simply another example of something we thought was cool but we don't really need?

ecommerce,"Ecommerce community, we need your feedback.","I've approached the other mods, as I've been thinking a lot lately about the state of our community and how its users interact with each other, as well as people who have not subscribed to the sub. We see many bans for users who are submitting marketing and PR-related blogs/articles, but we also see some users get banned because they're linking to their business for a purpose *other than* critique. While we don't want to fill our front page with self-promotion, we're considering offering a weekly stickied post where users can promote their businesses and/or resources they've found helpful to their businesses. In my opinion, this will help drive traffic to our community and also give you guys a chance to show off what you do.

I want to be clear: I'm not saying that we need to turn into an advertising slot for every single eCommerce site or resource. But I think it should be allowed in a weekly, contained post. Many other subs, such as /r/Twitter, allow their users to self-promote on Sundays, and I'd like to follow what they do. It keeps the sub clear of blog spam and shenanigans throughout the week, but gives users like you a chance to promote what you do without fear of being banned.

Additionally, /u/qverb posted a reminder of the following earlier, but removed it to make room for an all encompassing post:
We feel that our community - and those who have not yet joined us - need a reminder of the rules. We mods are so happy that you're reporting all the right things, because it keeps our sub clear of unwanted content - thank you! However, we also see good posts asking for legitimate advice get downvoted, and that can be really discouraging to a startup. The downvote button is for posts that do not promote conversation, troll posts, or posts otherwise not allowed in our sub. It is *not* a disagree button. Please keep this in mind as you help other business owners in their pursuit to greatness. 

For readers who have not yet joined our community, **READ THE RULES.** At this time, or rules are:

* No links to blogs, outside sources, or self-promotion. Posting a link to your site *is* allowed *in the body of your post.*

Some time ago I stopped being a wantepreneur and had my first sale. I'm trying to build a wholesale website. I have my supplier, shipping is taken care of. I belive I have set good prices. I'm having problems with conversions thou. 

  
I'm working on some copywriting so I can populate more/better category descriptions and I have started a basic blog to help customers find me through organic search and to help them make decisions.
 
 
My site: http://eqush.com/

 
I'm located in Poland.
Target customers are companies in European Union (hasle free shipping; but not exclusively) that need special PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) to either sell locally to smaller companies/retail or for providing protection of their employees (construction companies, manufacturing, butchers, lumberjacks, policeman, guards, etc.)

 
Please help me, I have trouble with conversions. As means of advertising I'm using only AdWords for now, but I know that I need to reach to my clients in more than one way.

 
Any advice or constructive criticism are welcome!

 
Thank you for your time.

 
Edit1: Product names and descriptions, as well as category structure is provided by the distributor. I'm thinking about making changes, but have difficulty due to sheer size of the catalog. Same with decreasing amount of products - I have difficulty chosing which ones should I remove to make it easier choice.

 
Edit2: I'm also planning on doing something useful with that stock photo carousel on the home page, but I'm still not sure what would benefit me and in what form. Any ideas on this?

I just stumbled upon this (Reddit has everything!) so point me in the right direction if I'm in the wrong spot.

The current Wishlist plugin I have is rather limiting, I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for one that would fit some (or all of my needs):

The features I would like to add would be:

* Ability to select the variation (the size) of the product.  Since we have single products available in 5 and 15 gallons, the current wishlist doesn’t allow you to save a particular size. (We treat the product as one and have them select the variation instead of having two separate products).
* Ability to add directly to cart from the wishlist
* Ability to specify a quantity to add to the cart
* Indefinite housing of the items (my understanding wishlist purges after 30 days or when the customer clears their cookies)
* Ability to re-order the items in the wishlist to the customer's liking
 
The vast majority of our customers order the same 5-10 products every time and this would make it simpler than searching and adding to their cart each visit.

The best way to describe the business is a kosher Omaha steaks. The business currently processes customers credit cards by storing them locally in a Quickbooks database. I would like to move to a payment gateway like Stripe, Braintree, Authorize.net etc. There are a couple of challenges, however.

We sell meat by it's catch weight. For instance, a customer might buy a steak on our website that for $10/lb. We estimate that the steak will weigh 1lb, so when the customer checks out, their shopping card records the item costs $10. However, when we actually send our pickers to pick the customers order, the steak may weigh 1.2lbs, and therefore actually cost $12. Because we currently store our customer's credit card numbers in our quickbooks database, we invoice the customer upon home delivery or shipment and then charge their credit card with the actual amount as determined by the weight of the picked products. 

One workaround I have thought of is to over-authorize a customer's card by a set percentage (say 150% of the estimated order.) Once the actual order is picked, the presumably lesser actual amount could then be captured. My worry here is that the actual charge could occur a few days later if, for instance, we are only processing a given cut of meat and shipping it to the customer later in the week. Would this work? 

Is there a better way to approach this problem?",4,4,2015-10-16,ECOM,0.06558701395988464,0.903275728225708,0.031137239187955856

1) I've had some want to charge 600.00 + dollars, PLUS free clothing...which I can't afford right now

2) I sent three outfits to one blogger...it's been over a month and she has not promoted my site or even worn the clothing...after a few emails checking in with her, I just gave up and chalked it up to being a loss.

It seems to me that technology costs for ecommerce platforms add up quickly.  

To deliver a great experience with loyalty, coupon generation, email automated marketing, in store pickup, advanced search, and general customization of themes, platforms like shopify get expensive quickly.  

Am I incorrect in being a little skeptical of the pricing model vs traditional retail platforms?   It seems because you avoid some costs (facilities overhead, mostly), tech costs escalate.  

Or maybe I am approaching it wrong?  Should I be switching platforms or developing my own integrations when the store starts performing with proven 'apps'?

Recently my lady made the suggestion that I should re-write some of my mass emails and form letters so that they are indistinguishable from personal emails. This has significantly changed my business, especially my abandoned cart.

Other personal emails have let me know that they couldn't justify the international shipping fee, at which point I had the opportunity to advise that we have free international shipping at a certain price point.  
If you want to try something similar, my abandoned cart email states that I'm holding the items for them, but I can't hold them much longer. That if they still want the items, they need to finish their checkout. Otherwise I have to make everything in their cart available in our store again.

I think there's a good amount of knowledge in the Reddit community we can all draw from, so let's chat!

&amp;nbsp;

**Why choose personalization as the trend?**

I run an eCommerce consultancy and am lucky to hear many questions from Founders, eCommerce VPs, and Directors at different companies. From this position I've begun to take note of different trends surfacing.

One category of question I've been hearing a lot recently are questions about personalization. Clients want to know how they can tailor their site to their users. How they can surface products a specific customer will be more likely to enjoy and offers they'll be more likely to take advantage of.

&amp;nbsp;

**How we've approached the personalization opportunity**  
We've brainstormed and implemented quite a few bespoke solutions. Most of the time it revolves around incentivizing users to remain logged in to their account—we have more history on them that way. We incentivize them to log in (and remain logged in) via discounts for registered users, remember me boxes, etc.

From there we have a view into what they've looked at in the past and their order history. From this data we can make intelligent guesses about what they'll want to look at in the future.

Sometimes our solutions are more involved. For example, we can track a customer's initial referring source and the sources responsible for sales separately. From this, you can learn what marketing channel is good at spreading the word and what's good at converting. Insights gleaned here often tell us that we should tailor a site's content differently depending on referral source.

Like I said though, all these solutions have been bespoke, meaning we have to implement them each time for each of our clients.

&amp;nbsp;

**Questions to get the conversation started**

* Is this something others in /r/eCommerce have given thought to?
* What are some of the solutions you've come up with, and how have they performed?
* Are there any tools you're using to assist in personalizing your customers' experiences?
* If you are engaging in eCommerce personalization, is it on your site, email campaigns, remarketing campaigns, or elsewhere?
* What kind of ROI have you seen on you personalization efforts?
* What kind of customer information do you pay attention to? Is there any information in particular you wish you could act on?

ecommerce,"Need ecommerce solution with tiered pricing (?), quick add to cart, importing a .CSV of 1,000+ items","Hi,

We have a small company that distributes 1,000+ different toy products, and we are a wholesaler. I need an online ecommerce site that is:

1.) Simple enough for me to setup - we would prefer to be able to setup and maintain the site with inhouse staff, and while we're comfortable with technology we are not coders or programmers by any means.

2.) Easily import item database (.CSV file or something) and also add images.

3.) Assign customers pricing tiers... so if an item is listed at $1, Customer Profile A would list it as $0.90, and Customer Profile B would list it as $0.80, for example. I could assign these profiles to customers as I see fit, and anyone without a profile would see $1.

4.) Have a ""quick add to cart"" button on each product.

5.) Budget - cheaper the better, but willing to pay a few thousand upfront.

I want to explore more of Shopify, except I need addons for tiered pricing and for the quick add... I think... I also really enjoy the easy of use and WYSIWYG editing, since I am code-illiterate. I've looked at a lot of the services [on the shopping cart wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_shopping_cart_software) but there's just so many.

shopify,Scouting Shopify to replace ShopSite,"So, we have an e-commerce site running right now on ShopSite backend, and personal nightmares aside, the big strike against it is we cannot figure out a way to reasonably integrate our custom POS software with it, to manage inventory.  Also, our current hosting and design group is a nightmare, so there's that.

The designer of our POS software has said he has looked at Shopify and believes he is able to integrate our POS with a Shopify instance, so that looks a lot nicer to us.  But I (being the person who'll likely be responsible for getting everything put together) have some questions...

I understand Shopify offers a decent free-trial period, but my concern is that I'd want a bit more time to see how the interface can be customized for my customers before deciding.

Are there shopify themes which can be looked at, edited and then examined OUTSIDE of the shopify system so as to see if the resulting interface would work well, without having the shopify free-trial expire and then be unable to test things out further?

How is hosting, is it all hosted by Shopify or do I run my own host?

Can we use two or more payment processing options?  I'd like the option to use our current credit processor's gateway (as they offer us a good rate and we're already comfortable working with their reporting) as well as Paypal for obvious reasons.

How about support assistance, how responsive is shopify to your support requests?

How easy is it to customize and build off of the existing shopify themes and templates?

ecommerce,Building a decentralized marketplace for trading directly with buyers and sellers,"Hey /r/ecommerce, I've been lurking here awhile but wanted to finally ask for your input on a product we've been building for awhile.

We’re building a new marketplace that lets people buy and sell goods directly with each other, called OpenBazaar. It's gotten funding from some VCs and we're going to be launching later this year.

I know that many of you do a lot of sales online and hoped you could answer a couple questions that might help us in building this new marketplace for vendors like you. The platform isn’t finished but we wanted to get feedback now.

OpenBazaar has no fees, because there’s no middleman. Buyers and sellers trade directly with each other using Bitcoin, with an optional third party that distributes funds if there is a dispute. 

This image might help explain:

http://i.imgur.com/SBhzW6g.png

## Questions

1. Would you begin using / accepting Bitcoin if you could avoid paying any marketplace fees?

2. Because OpenBazaar is a network of users buying and selling goods directly with each other, it isn’t a website you visit - instead it’s a program you download and run on your own computer. Does running a program on your own computer to sell your products seem too difficult or would it not be a problem?

3. What’s the single most important aspect as a vendor that an online marketplace must have?

ecommerce,A Friendly Tip: 7+ Order Confirmation Emails to Send,"We published a blog post yesterday on some of the best practices for transactional emails (order confirmation), and thought we'd share the important points with you.

A few stats:
- Order confirmation emails have an open rate of over 70% (the average email open-rate isn’t even 18%)

- It’s up to seven times more expensive to acquire a new customer in comparison to marketing to previous customers

- eCommerce spending for repeating customers is on average more than two times greater than that of new ones.

The point: optimizing order confirmation emails is a must for cost-effective growth.


GET MORE REVIEWS

1) Send it as soon as possible after the purchase. This is fresh in their head, and now is the time to capitalize on that.
2) Say “Thank you”. When was the last time you didn’t like feeling appreciated? Saying those two words trigger positive emotion that will increase the likelihood of someone following through.

3) Use an attractive image. We live in a digital realm in which visuals sell.


UPSELL

1) The upsell offer should not be the first thing that is noticed when opening the email.

2) Make sure that the recommended products are relevant. This should be personalized based on what was purchased and not the same products you show every customer.

3) Don’t give your customer too much to think about by offering too many products. Just like you’ve got five fingers on your hand, you should limit the email to include at most five products.


SOCIAL MEDIA GROWTH

1) A creative “Thank You” should go before any mention of your social media profiles

2) Unlike other emails you might be sending, in this case social media profile icons should not be in the footer, rather in the body of the email.

3) Do not add all of your social media profiles, just like you shouldn’t add dozens of products in efforts to upsell. The last thing you want is information overload. Our tip is to stick to four profiles at most.

4) You should most definitely include a call to action as to why they should follow you.


GETTING USER GENERATED CONTENT

1) Ask customers to share an image on one (maximum two!) social media networks (if you are using Pinterest, create a group board to add all the UGC).

2) If you are asking people to share on Instagram or twitter, then have them tag your brand as well as use a specific hashtag. If you want it on Facebook, just have them add it to your page.

3) Show other UGC between the headline and the call to action.

4) This email should be sent twice. Once after the order has been placed and again after they should have received the product. Unless all of your customers are brand ambassadors, many will forget to share if you don’t remind them.


ADD CONTENT

1) Context is everything so make sure you are not sending out your latest blog post or piece of digital content because it is the newest. Send the content that is targeted for each type of purchase, either by category or type of product.

2) Add a call to action for the content. People are busy and hold a short attention span. Just like you’ve got a call to action on your product page, here too add a catchy call to action like, “Get Started”, “Learn More”, “Read Now”, or “See How”.

3) Keep it visual and keep the text on a diet.


REFERRAL PROGRAM

1) Use a friendly headline, that isn’t called simply , “referral program”.

2) Make it a “can’t miss out on” deal. You’ve got to be willing to give something to customers to create a referral program that leaves you better off. It’s give and take relationship.

3) Make it easy to share via two or three social networks at most as well as via email.


GIFTS

1) This is a type of upsell, so first things first, get to the receipt.

2) Ask them if they need to do any holiday shopping. Maybe something along the lines of, “Do you still have holiday shopping to do?”.

3) Add a relevant call to action, such as, “For Him”, “For Her”, or “For Them”.

4) Sweeten the deal for them not only because they just made a purchase, but also because it’s the holiday season.

We highly recommend doing one of these things in your emails (especially now before the holiday season). For those just getting started or low on sales, you might want to try the going for more reviews or social media followers.",0,14,2015-10-23,ECOM,0.024431055411696434,0.9242880344390869,0.05128095671534538

ecommerce,Shopify vs. Volusion vs. BigCommerce Credit Card Rates,"I've been a bit of a Shopify fanboy (2 existing stores, one past temporary store, and working on a 3rd full-time one), but I had some issues with Shopify not being very handy in terms of ""subcollections"" so I decided to browse the other two big ""out-of-the-box"" platforms.

I noticed that BigCommerce on their $30 plan charges a 1.5% transaction fee in addition to credit card fees. I quit before looking into their processing rates because I got confused with so many different payment gateways.

Shopify charges no transaction fees if you use Stripe or PayPal, but charges a hefty 2.95% processing fee.

Volusion...charges 2.15% with no transaction fees. 

What I'm wondering is how Volusion charges so little? I don't think, for legal reasons, Shopify can take a spread on the fees without breaking it out from transaction fees (which I think is the whole reasoning behind transaction fees in the first place). Presumably then, this is just a pass-through cost on the end of the ecommerce solution.

The 3 platforms used to brag A TON about two big customer metrics: number of stores (last time I saw Shopify was about 4x the other two) and dollars processed (on a per store basis, Shopify was always the lowest). If I recall correctly, Volusion's total dollars processed was actually, by far, the highest.

I found a few articles from even a year ago showing Volusion's total sales processed through their stores still way higher than Shopify.

**Would this be the reason for the lower CC fees? Or something else I'm missing?**

I was hoping some of you Ecommerce wizards might be able to answer a few questions we have had in general as we continue to build the store.

For reference this will be a clothing store probably hosted through Shopify.

1. Is there a general rule on what your profit margins need to be to be successful?  (We are looking at retail prices around $20-35 not sure on wholesale prices yet, still waiting to hear back from a few places)

2. How do you know how much inventory to order? (I don't know enough about drop shipping and I am not sure the companies we are contacting offer drop shipping)

3. If we are not using dropshipping whats the best way to handle shipping where its not enough volume to outsource yet?

4. How do taxes work? I have run into some conflicting information on needing a business ID.  There will be no physical store but the address we will use will be in VA. I am a little confused on this one.

We are hoping to launch by Dec 1st but taking this slow as its our first venture down this road.

woocommerce,Trying to find a reasonable way to calculate shipping for a heavy product.,"I'm helping a friend make a website for their small hot sauce business. Shipping, of course, on a product in heavy glass bottles is pretty expensive. But the real problem is that the cost varies so much from area to area. Using generic ""$3 per bottle"" type shipping rates just doesn't work. 

I am hoping there's a plugin that uses USPS information based on weight that I could program like this: ""1-3 Bottles use flat rate Medium Box B"" ""4-6 Bottles use Large box C"" etc. and have it use the weight information, and address info, from there to calculate rate. Does that even exist?

I found one $22 plugin (this one: http://codecanyon.net/item/table-rate-shipping-for-woocommerce/3796656) that does ""table rate"" but I am dreading looking up and inputting rates for every single zip code in the USA (is that how people program table rate?

Although I am aware the systems that natively support this are rare, all I would need is the ability to implement it either myself or through open soruce software.

The idea is that you, as a customer, after the photography session is complete and the pictures touched up, would get a link through e-mail or sms. This would lead to your personalized page where you could see all your pictures, choose which one you like, and buy them as digital downloads.

Ideally, we'd be able to use it with Shopify as I have experience with Shopify and there are a lot of things I like about. If you google ""white label crowdfund"" or ""crowdfund yourself"", there is a lot out there but not a whole lot that looks exactly like what I'm looking for.

ecommerce,Ecommerce email marketing platform?,"I have been approached by bronto and want to see what alternatives there are. I'm not entirely sure what I am looking for but I would like segmentation and automated campaigns and something that is geared for ecommerce stores. 

I don't know how much you can automate the campaigns. 

Can you set it up to auto send new products/new deals, or dynamically select products that are related to the customers previous purchase?

Basically I have neglected my email list, I have around 25k on the list but havent sent out something in about a year. I am using a php script which is not very good and its too time consuming to make a newsletter and send it out, there are no segmentation and automation options. If its possible to set it and let it do its thing, it would be ideal for me. I want to maintain our relationship with our customers and I think email is a key option.

How much am I looking for cost and what options are available?

ecommerce,Started selling t-shirts online. Feedback?,"I recently just opened my store on Shopify. At the moment I sell good quality t-shirts with ""motivational"" quotes that I have designed myself, but the ultimate goal is to introduce more and more items that should be crafted all over the world, especially in Italy, in order to ensure the best quality and style. (I am Italian and live in Australia).


I have been working on this for the last 6-7 months, by using Instagram to build the image and the message of the brand, taking pictures and designing everything myself and now I am about to put out into the world and see how it goes.

For the time being I am trying to build the brand even further, advertise it and drive sales, but I am finding it hard to gain more followers. 

My plan is to sell t-shirts, focus on the project related to the t-shirts, then add more product and go on from there. 

Anyhow, I haven't made any sales yet (opened the store this week), but I wanted to know what you guys think and if you think I should change anything or improve certain things.

ecommerce,How do we get our first sale?,"I'm writing here as I'm running out of options. 
The store is: http://polghi.co.uk/

Me and my wife have decided to invest a good chunk of money to bootstrap our own business. I'm a software engineer (currently employed in London), she has been working with high fashion handcrafted clothing brands for years (we are originally from Italy).
The natural choice we made was to start selling online the same kind of products my wife has been selling for years.

Long story short: we spent months going around Italy to get the best suppliers we could find (italian artisans mostly, which have 0 presence online and that were still interested in selling abroad), we set up the online store and started some heavy campaigns with Facebook and Adwords. I knew from the beginning that selling without an audience is hard. 
BUT so far the results are beyond bad: 0 orders in over 20 days since we started!

We have cut all the prices, started promotional campaigns, contacted (and got covered) by bloggers. Nothing seems to work despite the product is really good. Any suggestion? Am I missing anything? Do you have any advice on how to get our first customer?

This ""bootstrap your company"" thing is really becoming an emotional roller coaster.",10,2,2015-10-31,ECOM,0.052262209355831146,0.9100540280342102,0.037683725357055664
