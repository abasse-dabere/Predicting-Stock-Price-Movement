ecommerce,Responsive Design - Your Thoughts?,"I have changed my idea on the current responsive design trend.  At IRWD Orlando last year, responsive design was all the rage.  *Everything* should be done for mobile in mind.  But in my own analytics, as well as continued reading from Internet Retailer and a growing number or other dissenters, I have decided to stop using responsive site design for the time being.  

I will, however, to optimize for mobile devices on the sites I have with their own mobile version.  Here are a few of the reasons that I am discontinuing (at least for the time being).  

- The platforms that I have tried them on just aren't there yet with their ability to customize the templates that they have in place.  Granted, this will get better, but I am more of a designer than a programmer.  

- Analytics for the sites that I manage do not demand it yet.  In fact, given the choice, a larger majority of mobile users will select to view the web version over the mobile version.  

- As a designer, I feel extremely limited designing a responsive site.  It may be a lack of my own creativity, but loosing so much of what I want on a page is not appealing to me.  

- Loading speed.  This is a big one.  The latest Internet Retailer says that the average load time for a responsive site is 18 seconds.  Compare that with only a second or two for a well designed standard page and you can see - this is not good.  Granted, this can be improved on, but back to my first point, I am suffering with the limitations placed on me.  

Most of the sites that I manage are content-heavy, and to pare the site down to a seriously handicapped mobile version is not in the best interest of my customers.  I am just not seeing the demand, even from our analytics.  

Just wanted to see some other opinions on this - for and against - for a little of my own 'grass roots' research.  Thanks!",6,6,2014-07-01,ECOM,0.03979486599564552,0.9164344072341919,0.04377070069313049

Target market wise, to be blunt are folks who buy stuff out of Urban Outfitters (Lomography cameras, record players) and use Tumblr and all the rest of it. My store will be selling old Polaroid instant camera's, retro inspired art. There's a lot going on.

Due to the ""All round"" nature of the store, i'm not sure how to go about tapping into my niche. I know there's definitely a market for these things, ""Hipster"" so to speak. I know the niche pretty inside out, it's just I don't want to waste any of my remaining capital on poor marketing decisions for my e-Commerce store.

2. Customers will need to be able to select their subscription, purchase it, and be able to change their subscription from their online account. Our subscriptions are location-dependent, so the customers need to be able to change it easily if they move.

3. Customers should be able to purchase multiple subscriptions.

4. We will need to be able to pull a list of subscriptions each month so we can ship each product accordingly.

5. We need the accounts system to track how long the subscriptions are valid for, remind us and the customer of upcoming expiration, and stop issuing shipment requests when the subscription expires.

6. We would like the ability to create customer accounts from our end because we will be selling subscriptions through third parties.

ecommerce,How to compete with sites like Overstock and Bed Bath and Beyond?,"Hi there, ecommerce entrepreneurs! I would love some advice: I am looking at an opportunity to start an ecommerce site that sells a great line of high quality home goods at a discount. I've been using the samples at home for a while and I'm definitely convinced that the design and quality are superior to stuff I've purchased on both those major home good storefronts (Overstock and BBB). But the major online retailers completely dominate the search listings for the items I would be selling. 
I always read about how content marketing can enable smaller online retailers to compete, but this would be my first ecommerce venture and I'm concerned that it won't work in cases where existing major sites are already so established. With the right content marketing approach, do you think there's a chance I'd be able to get enough traffic to make it worthwhile?

ecommerce,"Fulfillment, how do you do it and stay sane?","Hi All,

Started an ecommerce venture in April. Ended up picking a decent niche and with a lot of hard work, and with the luck of finding a great manufacturer the first time I am now on my way.

This month marks $3,000 in sales. In 3 full months I would say that is decent. My avg order is $15, $20 if you include the $5 shipping the customer pays per order (unless they order over $20).

My traffic isn't steady, it comes in bursts when I am mentioned on a blog. Other than that it is 1 - 3 sales a day. So for now, fulfillment is totally manageable by me. 

I sell 3 products. I wait until the end of the day, order my labels using a Shopify app, then print the labels and put them on USPS flat rate envelopes. Then I pack the items and send them on their way.

I am at a point where I do not make consistent enough sales where outsourcing to Amazon fulfillment makes sense yet, so I do it by hand. However, this is starting to get really cumbersome, and is taking away time I could be spending on making the site better and coming up with new strategies in terms of new products, etc. 

While I am waiting to get my SEO in check to hopefully get consistent traffic and sales (and therefore be able to move to a fulfillment company), I am looking to see if there are any tricks of the trade or if there are any ways to make fulfillment easier.

I want to increase my product line, but with fulfillment only being done by me, it seems as if that is a task I cannot add on to what I already do. 

Looking for some insight fellow entrepreneurs! Thanks.",8,2,2014-07-08,ECOM,0.016239557415246964,0.8354252576828003,0.14833512902259827

ecommerce,New to ecommerce - help me find a solution?,"A while ago I got into hand making jewellery, and I've amassed a bunch of products I'd like to sell online. This is basically a hobbyist project, I don't expect it to turn over a wild amount of cash, so any ecommerce solutions should be really inexpensive, or free.

I would say I'm a pretty competent graphic designer and front-end developer. I've avoided any type of ecommerce projects in the past on a ""too hard basket"" basis without ever giving it a go, but I'm open to learning now. -- So yeah I'm looking for something I can completely do myself.

Looking for:
Ability to set stock levels.
Add multiple items to cart.
Check out via PayPal.
Email seller and buyer with the order.

Would be awesome to be able to manage/update orders within an admin console but I could also do this manually. What I'm having trouble with is finding a solution I can dress myself as I'm quite particular about the brand look.

I am being asked by someone to look into Shopify and see if it'll fit their business plan and basically see how much the little costs are going to add up. Any other tips and tricks would be welcome, or alternative sites I should be looking at (like Bigcommerce?). I've never done this before, but happen to be the most ""computer-savvy"" of the network...but still definitely can't program or code so I need a CMS that will provide most for me (so no Magento from what I've read).

We carry men's decor, furniture, custom sports themed items, bar equipment, and much more. 

This is my second ecommerce store after my first one failed (which I learned a ton from). I built this one keeping in mind the problems of my previous one and am pretty excited about it. I value everybody's opinions here, so please let me know what you think!

Also, I am giving away one of our custom bar mirrors during the launch week if you are interested.

Thanks guys, and if I can help anyone out with their sites or any questions about launching ecommerce stores, please let me know!",22,2,2014-07-14,ECOM,0.026822883635759354,0.9265406131744385,0.04663649573922157

One of them is our flagship product that we want the customers to pay more attention to.  We are starting with 5-6 products, and our catalog will grow in time (6-12 months).

We've been browsing Shopify and other e-commerce websites, and none of the themes do small product lines too well.  We don't want the customers to visit our site and feel like it's empty.  A lot of the themes we see our either single product theme or a massive catalog theme.  I feel that we should avoid single product theme, but what can I do to make a site look populated without too many products?

ecommerce,Could really use some feedback-- tweak current site design or switch to new site design?,"Had a HUGE wall of text here, then just deleted it all and put it in bullet form for you all to read easily-- don't mind the brevity, I reallyyyyy appreciate your feedback!

**Summary**: Current site has low conversion rate and is not mobile-friendly. Considering switching to new theme, but not sure if it's an ""upgrade"".

**What we care about most in a website**:

1) Brand image

2) Conversion rate

**Current Homepage:** [http://www.rawathletics.com/](http://www.rawathletics.com/)

**Current Product Page:** [http://www.rawathletics.com/vapor-fresh-sports-laundry-detergent/](http://www.rawathletics.com/vapor-fresh-sports-laundry-detergent/)

**Alternative Homepage:** [http://athletic-demo.mybigcommerce.com/](http://athletic-demo.mybigcommerce.com/)

**Alternative Product Page:** [http://athletic-demo.mybigcommerce.com/copy-of-yellow-single-speed-bike/](http://athletic-demo.mybigcommerce.com/copy-of-yellow-single-speed-bike/)

**Pros of current site**

1) I really like the feel of the site above the fold on both pages-- looks custom and memorable.

**Cons of current site**

1) Content is not easily digestible (leading to low conversion rate)

2) Not responsive / not mobile-friendly

ecommerce,I sell a product directly from my site; unavailable anywhere else - Question regarding Amazon.,"I'm thinking about creating a seller account for Amazon, however with a twist.

This will increase my search results and give the product ""legitimacy"" through it's additional listing on Amazon (and not just on my site).

By allowing the stock on Amazon to sell out so quickly, it shows high-demand and gets people to go to my site, from Amazon, without needing to pay any seller fees, by making sales through Amazon.

I know that the zip code doesn't always correspond with the user's self-identified city, but...who cares? As far as I know, that doesn't matter for billing or shipping.

ecommerce,Order fulfillment process? Any ideas?,"Hello!
I am wondering if anyone can give insight on what a streamlined order fulfillment process would look like...

My current process:

1.Print 2 order invoices (one will be used to pick, one will be included in the package) 

2. Take both of the invoices and paperclip them together

3. Take it to the warehouse and use the top sheet as a picklist. As each item goes into a bag (for each order) the picker initials on each item to mark it as added to the order.

4. Once all orders are picked, we carry the order bags (each order now has its own bag with the items associated) to the packing table..

5. We dump out the contents of the bag and put it into boxes/envelopes and seal them.

6. Once all orders have been packed into their final boxes, we take them to the ship dept. where each package will be entered into the system to have a label printed.

7. After about 10 orders are entered, we batch them and print the labels. and move that batch to the side and rest the unattached labels on top of the packages and move it to our labeling tabel

8. Add labels to packages and complete.

------------

That is our current process, but I don't feel like it's the most effective as my business scales. I've seen some features in the software we use that will print pick lists for a bunch of orders at once. This seems like a cool idea, but I dont understand it... What happens when all the items are picked? Do you just dump it onto the table and try to find the orders that are associate with each product? I have to be missing something...

How do the bigger retailers do it? (well, the ones that don't have all the conveyer belts and stuff)

Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :)

ecommerce,Surviving your first year as an ecommerce entrepreneur [PODCAST],"Hey /r/ecommerce

Just wanted to send along another interview I did with a successful Shopify entrepreneur (this guy is on track to do $1 million+ in sales).  

Today’s guest is Wes O’Donnell.  Wes owns 2 Shopify stores and is starting on his 3rd.  Wes quit his job and needed an income and he had absolutely zero profits for 8 months but then everything turned around because all the work he was putting in for those 8 months started paying off exponentially (started making $16K in profits by in month 9).

By the end of this podcast you will learn how to deal with doubt in the first year of being in business, how to do SEO yourself, how to get expert content written for your blog, how to get customers to do the selling for you.

Wes also shares actual revenue and profit numbers and we’ll be talking about his latest project where he aims to start with an idea and create a Shopify store and aim to hit a very high revenue goal in just one year and video tape the entire process for the world to see.

This is a longer podcast so this is the first of two parts.

ecommerce,"Ecommerce lessons from interviews with the founders of Bonobos, Threadless, Nasty gal","Lessons on building an ecommerce empire from the founders of successful stores. Some great quotes and war stories here.

**1. Bonobos -- Andy Dunn**

On starting with a 'HERO' product:

* A great brand starts with a hero product. Establish credibility in one product first.
* Denim is one of the most crowded markets, but if doing well there allowed Bonobos to expand into other categories

**2. Threadless -- Jake Nickell**

How being an early adopter with new mediums helps with free marketing:

* Jake was the 1,500th user on Twitter
* As a result, Twitter helped Threadless with early promo
* First brand on Instagram

**3. Nasty Gal -- Sophia Amoruso**

Finding ways to run cheap pilot tests for products:

* Sophia posted product shots on MySpace to get qualitative feedback
* Negative feedback ('that model looks angry"") would nudge her to change her approach, like changing the model for the product

dropship,Re: eCommerce is hard,"I started an eCommerce site back in March 2014, after a lot of painstaking research and hard-work. In fact I am using the dropship model as I cannot afford to invest in stock but I am having a hard time getting the business off the ground. 

So far I have only made #eight 8 measly sales since March 2014. The last sale was last month through organic search on Google. You can view the website here www.traditionalshavingshop.co.uk

I chose this niche, as it has a good price-point and you can't find it locally. This was the main criteria in choosing this particular niche. Since SEO has gotten so much hard is it best to just stick to Google Adwords I know it's expensive but I'm scratching my head trying to figure this out. 

So far I've learned that eCommerce is just plain hard-work and since I am dropshipping it I think it's even harder. But with someone like Andrew Youderian from eCommerce Fuel how did he do it, a business like his would certainly change the trajectory of my life but I'm not seeing the results I want to see with my eCommerce business.  

How long do I have to do this before I start seeing results in terms of sales and revenue as it's very demotivating working hard and not seeing any results. Honestly it feels as though I'm banging my head against a brick wall sometimes and I'm feeling I want to quit it but If I do that I will have failed before it even got started.
