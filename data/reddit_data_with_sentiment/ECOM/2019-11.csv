dropship,"$2,325 in Sales in a month without Paid Ads","The profit margin on this store is around 70%.

The key here is to start a niche store,  position it as a micro brand within a community (your niche community), and indirectly sell to them. Don't post about your ""90% off sale"", instead post stuff they want to see and then chat with people who engage.

Stop using loads of scarcity or loads any of that spammy stuff.

dropship,4 Types of Facebook Ad Copies,"I have been taking notes from day one in my journey as an ecommerce entrepreneur which is around 3 years back. After years in the business and getting a lot of help from the community when I started. I thought to share my notes with you guys so you can make the best out of this Q4. Here is my note on ad copies for Facebook. Hope it helps someone.

**4 Types of Facebook Ad Copies**  


1. **A.I.D.A.**

This stands for Attention, Interest, Decision, and Action. These ads are generally only about 3-4 sentences. That's why you see so many ads that have ""ATTENTION (fill in the blank)"" as the first sentence. Whatever it is, make sure the first sentence is attention-grabbing and stops people as they scroll through there feed. The second sentence should give a little info about the product or service and should also capture their interest. The third or fourth sentence should give a piece of information or phrase that pushes the user towards a decision. And last, but definitely not least, you should always end with a Call to Action! For example: Buy it now, Try it Today, See if you qualify, etc.

*A.I.D.A. Ad Copy Example:*

*Attention Cat Lovers! There's a new awesome product every cat craves! It's the ultimate new cat-playground so your cat gets the exercise it needs while still having FUN! Get it today while supplies last!*

&amp;#x200B;

**2.  Short Click-Bait Style Ad Copy.**

When doing click-bait style copy, try not to be too obvious about it. Facebook may pick up on your tactics and you could be penalized. There are definitely ways to do it legitimately, and although you might get good results bending the rules. You could be putting your account in jeopardy. With this type of copy make sure you're leaving the user wanting more! Generally, with this style, you NEED to take the person to an advertorial or pre-sell. They'll need something that gives them more information before actually taking them to your Landing Page.

*Click Bait Copy Example:*

*5 Things You NEED to know before Flying Internationally. You won't believe how many people forget #4!*

&amp;#x200B;

3.  **Long-Form Ad Copy.**

For this type of ad copy, you will want to use around 300-500 words. The ad should be about the length of a short blog. Many times this method works wonderfully, but it really depends on the product or service. Probably the most powerful aspect of long copy is the ability to overcome the user's objections, whereas a shorter ad copy is mostly trying to get the user to take immediate action. The copy for this would be pretty much identical to whatever information you would have in an advertorial. But instead, you would just use it as your ad copy. You can look at pretty much any blog, article, or advertorial for examples of this method. In general, a long copy is best used for technical products that need a lot of explanation, or to explain why a user should purchase a higher value item.

 

4. **Testimonial Ad Copy.**

This would generally be a testimonial about your product or service. You can use a written testimonial, video, or even both. Then you will want to place a good call to action after the endorsement. This method works very well and really helps lend credibility to your products or service. This method works especially well for retargeting, but can also be used on cold traffic.

I want to start a new store and I want to try using Alibaba. I have few years experience using dropship and pod on ebay but not on shopify. But that few years ago.

I have few products in mind which is not a trendy niche@product and would love to do my own branding in those products. 

So question #1, to use Alibaba I MUST buy from them in bulk and store somewhere else and ship from there? Any alibaba users successfully dropship from alibaba? Is there any tips or tricks on this? Like using fulfillment companies, sourcing agents, private  dropship agents etc?

My next question, any tips to play around the company's high MOQ? Since I am just starting so I don't have high capital in hand. Maybe a tip how to negotiate to lower MOQ?

dropship,My drop shipping mistakes (in the beginning),"My first time drop shipping I made a fuck ton of mistakes as we all do. Here are a few I can remember.

1.) I had tons of products (jewelry niche) but I kept the product description from aliexpress. This was very unprofessional and made my product page look like shit.

2.) Pictures. Make sure you have high quality pictures. 

3.) I didn’t remove the shopify branding, you can get rid of the “powered by shopify” by going into the language page for your website and searching up “powered by shopify” and then simply clicking the box and press the space bar then save

4.) I didn’t do branding. Branding is very important because one day when everything is voice activated you’ll want customers saying “buy me a [insert product] from [your company name]

5.) Make your logo noticeable, this goes back to branding. People need to know who the fuck you are.

6.) Put all your policy pages in the footer, make sure you read through your policy pages so you understand them and you can revise the incorrect spelling and grammar, there is a lot.

7.) Do a lot of market research. It sucks ass to build a company then realize no one cares about your shit so you have to start over with something else.

8.) Marketing &gt; advertising. Appeal to who consumes your shit, don’t just try to shove a product in their face. 

9.) Social media is a great way to create free content that generates a lot of traffic. I post 100 times a day for each of my companies on all platforms with my end consumer.

10.) Just cause you spend money doesn’t mean you’ll make money.

shopify,Comparing add-to-cart data between Shopify and GA,"**TL:DR Want to know daily add-to-carts. Can't find such a report from Shopify. Google Analytics shows visits to /cart and /checkout but I have option for customer to go directly to checkout so I don't know how to capture ALL add-to-carts.**

I've just made changes to my Google Shopping Campaign that have throttled my store's performance (this always tends to happen when I make changes). While I see what happens with that, I wanted to pay closer attention to my funnel through PPC. 

But what is the best way to know add-to-carts? When it comes to Shopify, there's a ""Sessions by Landing Page"" report available from Analytics, but as I understand it, that means it only captures or reflects the first page that a visitor landed on. That would never be a cart page, although it could be a checkout page, because when an email gets sent out by me with a tracking number, the customer often clicks the link there and it takes them to their order information. For example, today, I have zero conversions (due to aforementioned issue), but I do have a few sessions for the ""Checkout"" landing page type. 

Now, going to Google Analytics, I started looking at the ""Pageviews by Page"" data under Behavior &gt; All Pages. I looked at the ""/cart"" page. I have an ""add to cart"" and a ""buy now"" button. The first one takes the visitor to the cart, the second one takes them to the express checkout page where they can start entering their contact information/shipping details. I have a sticky cart app but I believe it is not actually working. When I see pages with /orders/ in the path, I know it is customers clicking on links from the emails they get after ordering. I also see pages with /checkout/ in the path, but I don't know if these are people who got there directly (buy now button) or after going through the cart (add to cart button). 

So basically, I don't feel I have complete data from either Shopify or Google Analytics. With Shopify, unless there's something I'm missing, there's no reports on add-to-carts, or at least on all page sessions (at least without a higher tier plan). Shopify used to show me an abandoned cart rate on my app because it wanted to suggest ways I could reduce the it. This lasted maybe a couple weeks, and it wasn't presented as daily data. 

Can someone explain if I can get this data from Shopify at my basic plan? If not, between the /cart and /checkout pages on Google Analytics, which one should I go by? Both?",6,7,2019-11-02,ECOM,0.08286207169294357,0.8937059044837952,0.02343204990029335

dropship,This is what scaling looks like. AMAA,"[Proof of Sales](https://imgur.com/a/T2Kg9zH)

&amp;#x200B;

Very recently, I created a store with a new client. The client pays me a flat monthly rate and % of revenue (with bonuses for hitting targets). He had a similar store in the past that did a couple orders a day and showed some interest from people in the product but I could tell he was doing a LOT of things wrong. After some talking back and forth and a LOT of convincing that I could help, he decided to recreate his store with me (because his current store was poorly reviewed and had a lot of minor issues as well; it was easier for me to create a new store for him). In a very short amount of time, I was able to increase his sales by 2-4x consistently and we recently scaled even further, as shown in the proof above. He is currently facing some issues with cash flow management, which is very annoying for me since I don't want to be a lender, but I also want to see him fulfill these orders in a timely manner. He is dropshipping from a company in his native country and about 90% of his customers are from the same country so shipping is very fast, as long as he fulfills these orders in time, which he has not been doing... Anyways, I can get more into the details if there is sufficient interest. The real reason for this post was to share some knowledge with everyone about how to scale your online business.

Is the top 10% traffic notification a poor indicator of success? Like maybe only 15% of the people who launched at the same time are still at it... I’m curious what you all know about this.

If top 10% traffic is a good indicator, I feel like I’m just a couple tweaks away from big success. Call me naive, but I feel like a “Shopify expert” would be a big help in my case. (That is IF top 10% traffic is actually an accomplishment)

shopify,The ultimate guide to Facebook ads interpretation,"Hey r/Shopify Redditors,

I created this internal guide for myself to try to interpret Facebook ad metrics. It has come out of the result of extensive Facebook ad testing, as well as discussions with multiple different Facebook ad agencies about the same topics. I don't think there's anywhere else it's defined in this much detail available on the internet, so I hope to both beginners and seasoned Facebook marketers alike, this guide will be useful.

In terms of what the abbreviations mean, it's a bit doctorly in nature:

Sx = ""symptoms""

Ix = ""how to tell if this is the right diagnosis i.e. Investigations""

Dx = ""diagnosis""

Rx = ""what to do to fix it""

**So, here goes - the complete guide to interpreting how your Facebook ads are performing.**

**CTR**

* **Low CTR –**  

   * Dx: Audience not engaging withAd creative
   * Rx: change creative, audience, or product
* **High CTR, no ATCs** –  

   * Sx:  

      * Audience likes creative
      * However they're stuck at product page
   * DDx:  

      * Price too high
      * Product page poorly made (needs better conversion rate optimisation)
      * Site not loading
   * Ix:  

      * Use HotJar or some equivalent to peer exactly into exact behaviours of customer on website
   * Rx:  

      * Change price
      * Optimise landing page
      * See if site loading
* **High CTR, High ATCs, No Sales –**  

   * Sx:  

      * Getting stuck at checkout
      * About 50%f InitiateCheckouts should convert to Purchase. If not, worry a little bit.
   * Ddx:  

      * Shipping costs preventing people from purchasing
      * Pre-purchase upsell preventing purchase
   * Ix:  

      * Hotjar
   * Rx:  

      * Introduce free shipping
      * Some people think countdown timers may help but I wouldn't

**Landing Page Views**

* Landing Page View : Content Views  

   * Sx:  

      * A good ratio is 1:3 i.e. for every landing page view, you get three content views to this/other products
      * If not this high, then means low site engagement as a whole
   * DDx:  

      * Site doesn't resonate with audience
      * Site loads too slow
   * Ix:  

      * Hotjar
   * Rx  

      * Optimise conversion rate of website

**Frequency**

* Frequency &gt; 1 per day (e.g. if VC 7d and frequency &gt;7)  

   * Sx:  

      * Anything with a ratio \&amp;gt;1 per day is way too high e.g. ATC 3d audience with a frequency of \&amp;gt;3.00
      * Also anything with a frequency of \&amp;gt;3.00 in general is probably too high in my opinion
   * Rx:  

      * Reduce spend, OR
      * Horizontally scale to broader audiences

**Higher Level With Purchases**

* High Sales, Low ROAS –  

   * Dx:  

      * Product and product page is good
      * However product-market-margin fit not yet approximated correctly
   * Ix:  

      * Trial of increasing price of product
      * Need to test and refine ad audiences
   * Rx:  

      * As for Ix.
* High CPM, High Sales  

   * Dx:  

      * Occurs when competing with a lot of advertisers
   * Rx:  

      * Use a concurrent PPE campaign with the same POST ID to get more organic traffic via shares
      * This will lower CPM

I've recently started another dropshipping store- my second. I have never encountered this problem. I have a strong background in digital marketing- agency experience. My ads are doing great (FB/IG). Fantastic CPC/CTR etc and cost per add to cart and initiate checkout are cheap, and those two metrics are great on-site.

I am seeing a lot of declined payments- not being from ""insufficient funds.""

Are credit card companies declining payments to my store because it's new? I'm located in the U.S. and my customers are primarily U.S. / AUS / Canada. Is Shopify Payments looked down upon by CC companies? IDK whats going on but I am losing lots and lots of orders. Shopify support has assured me all is well, but many times its two abandoned carts in a row that the reason is bc of declined payment.

If Shopify Payments is the problem, is there a way to switch to a different payment provider that has a better repertoire with CC companies?

shopify,How understanding funnels well allows you to ad spend profitably,"It is vital – and I don't use this word lightly – to know how random people become purchasers, in order to understand how to advertise to them. Let's take this example of a successful ad, which gets you sales:

Someone who doesn't know your store, sees your ad. They click on the ad, go to your store, maybe even add a product or two to their cart. If you've done things well, they buy your product. Sometimes people get distracted and forget to buy the product, in which case they just need a reminder to buy it. Or sometimes they need a little push. What we've described is a funnel. You could also think of this as a customer acquisition journey. Basically, every customer has to go through a series of steps before they buy a product.

In the famous book Breakthrough Advertising, which can be considered the bible of marketing, Eugene Schwartz clarifies this journey. From stranger to buyer:

**Unaware** – no idea of problem or your product. 

**Problem aware** – knows they have a problem that they want solved, but don't know what is used to solve it.

**Solution aware** – knows there is a solution, but don't know a specific product to solve it.

**Product aware** – knows about your product.

**Most aware** – someone who just needs a little push to buy your product. In terms of Facebook advertising, we can therefore simplify this to:

# Understanding TOFU, MOFU, BOFU

* **Prospecting (TOFU)** – Facebook ads that are shown to people that are either unaware, problem aware, or even solution aware. But they don't know about your product specifically. 
* **Engagers (MOFU)** – people that have already seen your ad. They've possibly even watched your video ad, or clicked the Like button, or commented. 
* **Retargeting (BOFU)** – people that have visited your website. These correspond to product aware and most aware stages. You will make the most profit on this audience. 
* The idea is that you should:
   * Be at least breakeven ideally or even at a slight loss for prospecting ads. 
   * But be very profitable for retargeting ads. 
   * Therefore, overall be profitable. 

**A little more on the specifics types of audiences of funnels:** 

❄️ Top of Funnel (TOFU) (Cold Audience) - is targeting a cold audience ie. people who haven't engaged with the brand/visited the website in the last 30 days. We're simply trying to drive 'new' visitors to the website and/or create a positive first touch point with the brand. This is where we use our Lookalike audiences and Interest targeting to find 'new' website visitors/customers. These are typically the lowest converting campaigns but the most volume as they feed the rest of funnel as visitors progress further down.

☀️ Middle of Funnel (MOFU) (Warm Audience) - targeting slightly warmer audiences ie. people who may have viewed a video or engaged with page content or an ad but haven't yet clicked through to the website. Our objective is to now push them to the website to view a product and convert. This is where we use our PPE engagement and page like audiences, while excluding the website visitors (typically last 30 days) to drive these engagers to the website and pixel them to retarget if they don't convert into a purchase on this attempt.

🔥 Bottom of Funnel (BOFU) (HOT audience) - Retargeting website visitors and leads who didn't purchase to return and complete the sale. There is varying levels of 'intent' based on various actions for eg. someone who has added to cart is generally more likely to convert to a sale more than someone who just viewed the product and left. So, the the further down the funnel/closer to the purchase event - the higher the intent.

**✅ In terms of audience quality/intent from lowest to highest:**

Homepage visit Only ⏬ Category Page View ⏬ Product Page View (ViewContent) ⏬ Add To Cart ⏬ Initiate Checkout ⏬ Add Payment Info ⏬ Purchase

...and within each of those you have different levels of intent again that you can create custom audiences to target for eg. someone who viewed 4 product pages is probably higher value than someone who viewed one product and bounced

Or someone who has added to cart 3x and not purchased is much more likely to purchase than a visitor that added to cart just once...

✏️ Now, you can create specific ad copy messaging to cater to these people depending on the actions they have taken.

🥊 POST SALE (Customers) - Here we are simply retargeting our customers and trying to extract as much LTV (Life-Time Value) out of each customer we acquire as possible. While also just adding value to their experience to build brand loyalty. Thanking them for the purchase, putting additional relevant products and offers in front of them, asking for UGC, rewarding them for referrals etc etc

dropship,Do NOT advertise for website traffic if you want sales.,"I made this mistake the hard way! I was paying 8 cents a click for website traffic on Facebook ads. Looking online at the “1 percent of people convert” rule, I thought with this, I’d be doing great. 

Nope! Even while targeting very specific groups of people for my niche, MOST of the traffic was bouncing (77%) and site engagement was so low (hardly any cart adds, etc.). It was cheap traffic that had hardly a chance at converting. 

Now I’ve switched to cart conversions. WOW the difference is staggering. High quality traffic, much lower bounce rate, high engagement (product views, add carts, checkouts). The difference is insane. For example, today 30% of visitors added something to their cart, and 10% initiated checkout and 4% converted. Yes, cart conversions are more expensive, but when you look at overall conversions they are cheaper. And this is with half the traffic I was getting with website clicks...

I’m new to Facebook marketing and have been trying to learn everything I can. So far, my store is break even, but as I move from add to cart to purchase advertisements I’m pretty sure I’ll start seeing a good profit soon.

dropship,My Dropshipping Journey,"Hi Everyone! :)

I don’t have any dropshipping experience. I know nothing about advertising or business in general. You couldn’t be more of a noob than I am at the moment. 

If anyone here is interested, (please let me know!) I am willing to share my dropshipping journey with you on this sub in the form of a monthly update. I will let you know what I have been focusing on, what mistakes I have made and if I made any profits. I am not sure yet, but going off what I’ve read so far, I don’t know how open I can be if it comes to my product/website. 

So far, I have signed up for a paid account at ecomhunt to find a good product, I am watching Youtube videos, mainly from Gabriel St-Germain and I am considering to buy a course. ( I see a lot of contradictory advice on this. Some people say it’s a waste of money while others say it will save a lot of time and effort.) I’m not sure if you are allowed to share on this sub, but if you know any courses that are worth buying at my level, I would love to know.

As English is not my native language, I already experience some trouble if I think about how to write product descriptions, etc. Although with some persistence and a good attitude I believe this can be overcome. Wondering too if it can be problematic that I’m not in the USA. 

For now, I will be doing more research, pick a good product, try to build a store and do some advertising through Instragam influencers. My budget is around €500,-, but with some carefelul money spending, I could maybe increase that a little. 

All input, help and suggestions are much appreciated. At the moment, I am not able to assist you in your dropshipping journey yet, but let’s hope this changes as the monts progress. For all other beginners, I hope that seeing me struggle and persist can help you push through too. That’s it for now. I will be posting again at the begin of December, with some occasional beginner questions in between now and then probably.

4.27% for electronics. Industry average is 1.89%, as per Shopify. So I'm +2.38 percentage points above the norm - more than double.

# What's the secret?

It's mostly clever retargeting. Seems hilariously simple, but ignore it at your own peril. The thing is that retargeting itself has many potential mechanisms to explore, and is usually *well* worth the time it takes to set it up.

* **Conversio**. This is email retargeting. It’s $20/mo. My revenue in return was $1300.66 ($881.07 in USD). So essentially, I spent $180 for the subscription so far, and got back $881.07 back in revenue, making it $701 in automatically generated profit. An alternative is Klaviyo.
* **Personalizer – AI Recommendations by Limespot.** An extremely easy to set up app that does wonders on Revenue per product view (a whopping $3.91 per page *visit* compared to $0.86 without). **Overall, conversion rate is 10.32% as compared to 2.43% without it.**
* **SMSBump.** This is an SMS retargeting app that sends customers an SMS after they add their product to cart or take certain actions on your website. To be honest, for me it doesn’t spend *that* much – I spent $25.11 and got sales worth of $152.76. The return on investment is therefore technically 608.36%, which sounds amazing but of course it’s for not that many purchases.
* **YotPo.** This app is free but actually very good for branding. As pictured below, it allows you to ask for reviews from your customers. Conveniently, your store doesn’t have to look bad if you get bad reviews, as you can filter the reviews manually. This isn't quantifiable ROI-wise unfortunately as I've always had it installed so never A/B tested it.
* **Discounted Upsells.** This app is seriously awesome. Basically it creates a pop-up after someone purchases allowing them to buy a second product for 15% off. For me, in a single month it generated **$516.06 AUD extra income** from orders, which is equivalent to $349.56 USD. I spent $19.99 USD on it. **So that’s basically a 1748.67% ROI from one app.** The way I set it up was to create a Buy X for Y Upsell discount. This is where I offer a second product at 15% off. You have to try to see which products seem to match in your store.

# Anything that could be done better?

* Conversio works for email marketing, but I'd like to personally increase the amount of email marketing I do. To this degree, I've started using **Wheelio** with a 9% email opt-in rate, and still have yet to really amp up my Klaviyo campaigns.
* **Hotjar** is extremely good for analysing your users. I'd recommend it to *everybody*.
* Social proof pop ups may help, but it's a little hard to quantify.
* I only advertise to a single country for the particular store that uses these apps (I have multiple stores with multiple variations of apps), but **Coin** by ShopPad is what I'd use for multi-currency conversion.

# What theme should you use?

I use the [Pop theme](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/pop/styles/bone) personally. It was free. I think the copy and imagery matters a lot more in the end, and people get a bit too focused on themes.

# Is there anything else I should know?

I think one significant aspect is that although I love Facebook ads, a lot of the ads for this particular store was actually done using Google Adwords/Shopping campaigns. I think intuitively the higher intent traffic naturally means higher conversion rates. However, both Facebook ads and Google ads have been profitable for me, and certainly Facebook retargeting ads should not be ignored either.

**Advanced:** More specifically, for Facebook ads I would retarget those in ViewContent or AddToCart within 7 days, excluding purchases within 30 days, and send them a dynamic carousel that has a 15% off discount code. At a minimum you'll get a return on ad spend (ROAS) of 2.5 or above, but more typically the range is from 3.00 - 7.00. In atypical circumstances I've seen ROAS as high as 29.00, but these products are almost always high ticket and are also almost always either very niche or have phenomenal branding as a pre-requisite.

# Conclusion

Hope you find this useful! Like the other posts I've written on r/Shopify, I wrote this post because it would be helpful for other people, but also wanted to be transparent and say I'd like to plug this guide I wrote as well about an [A-Z approach to Facebook marketing](https://fbadsblueprint.carrd.co/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=content_marketing). **If you've ever wondered about what types of audiences to target, how much to spend per ad set, what sort of ad creatives work best, and those sorts of questions - then this is pretty much my brain dump to all of the above questions after spending thousands on Facebook ads myself.**

Again, nonetheless, this post should be extremely useful in and of itself and should still be very valuable to you.

shopify,Shopify is STEALING from web developers,"Im a longtime shopify partner....ive built over 300 stores on shopify over multiple years over 7 shopify plus stores across my two partners accounts

but i am literally at my wits end with these people

i spent two weeks as a developer, custom coding a website for a motivational speaker to sell his books that he currently sells on amazon

im going to attach the design for reference

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/a/w5hqEnz](https://imgur.com/a/w5hqEnz)

&amp;#x200B;

this morning i wake up and the site is deactivated, it was still in development, hadnt even been activated or had a domain attached to it....had no ""banned terms"" on it because the majority of words on it were ""Lorem ipsum"" placeholders

now i get to spend my day hitting up risk operations to be told i cant retrieve any of the code i spent weeks building, and not given a reason why the shop was shut down mid-development without ever being live

this is outright infuriating and frightening.....do i literally have to save a backup every single night and live in fear that shopify will nuke weeks of hard work from orbit without explaining any reasoning

then deny you access to any of your files?

why are they so hostile to ""Partners""?

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE:**

i called in to shopify,  and told a ""shopify guru"" what happened. He reached out to the Risk Operations team. They refused to speak with me or give the guru any details to relay to me and told the guru to end the call so they could email me.

they then sent me a CANNED RESPONSE....with the WRONG SHOPIFY listed.....WOW!

The Email --&gt; [https://imgur.com/a/caeghRk](https://imgur.com/a/caeghRk)

the shopify they closed was meetstephanspeaks.myshopify.com

they referenced [pure-tropix.myshopify.com](https://pure-tropix.myshopify.com)   which is a misspelling of the actual site [puretropix.myshopify.com](https://puretropix.myshopify.com) without the hyphen

and that site was made back in 2016 and is still online with no issue

they have not responded to any further emails and wont take any direct calls....which is typically the case with shopify risk operations

**UPDATE #2:**

dropship,We Are In MAJOR Debt With Shopify,"My friend and I decided to start dropshipping, our first website did very good in our eyes. We thought we were making profit everyday, we scaled it up to 40k in one month. We decided to open a second store. The second store did 35k in 1 month. We were doing great it seemed!

Then, we started paying for all these orders, and we realized that we were actually negative with advertising, on our first site. WE were down about 6k. So we used the second stores income, to pay off the first stores, (we got a manual review and our payments were on hold, we panicked and payed for all the orders that were left) Then, we begin working mainly on our second site.

At this point, we were actually profitable on our second store, but we couldnt pay for 1200 orders because we paid off the first store. We are making about 500$ a day in profit with our second store. \*we planned on paying for these orders in about 2 weeks when we had enough money saved.

Now we are 1200+ orders in debt. 10k if we fulfilled them, 30k if we refunded. We only have 4k in our account, and shopify has put us on hold for not fulfilling orders. We never truly wanted this to happen, we are not trying to do anything bad. We just got behind and have no money to get back up.

ecommerce,My Website Gets NO Traffic,"At a loss and looking for advice.  I'm getting on average 0-3 clicks a day.

Here is a link to my store:

[https://blackmountainorganics.com/](https://blackmountainorganics.com/)

I tried running Facebook ad's, which drew minimal amounts of traffic to the website during the duration I was running said ad's, same thing with Google ad's.  I did this a few times, trying different ad approaches (honesty I didn't really know what I was doing but tried my best) and same story each time, a bit of traffic and that was all.

Not really sure what I was expecting but I guess my hope was that in time the website would begin to get organic traffic via Google searches simply as a nature of it being online as it's in my opinion that due to the uniqueness of the product I'll end up getting the most sales from people who are actively searching for what I'm selling as opposed to advertising or social media campaigns.

Getting traffic from Google searches is still the goal, I just don't know how to get there.  Should I hire a marketing/advertisement company?  Look into influencer marketing?

Developing and making the product as well as designing (including photography) and writing the content for the website is/was really my strong suite.  Even just getting 25 clicks a day would make me happy.  As of now the website is really just sitting there.

I am getting a solid amount of sales through Etsy though along with 5 star reviews!  Most of the sales on Etsy are from people actively searching for what I'm selling (i.e. ""Tallow Balm"", ""Tallow Moisturizer"", ""Tallow Cream"", etc.), which again, reinforces why I'd love to see organic traffic from Google searches as I'm positive it will result in some sales.

The ad creative itself is - apart from product and audience - **the biggest single differentiator in determining whether** **your ad will make sales or not**, and is also the difference between making a click or not. 

To help you out with creating your ads, here is a list of important and specific principles that will mean you have a much better chance of performing better with them, based off my own experiences and also the experiences of many other digital ads agencies. 

Fundamentally: what sort of ads would have persuaded you? Those are the types that you should aim for.

Unfortunately - unlike [interpreting Facebook ad metrics well](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/ds2ovu/the_ultimate_guide_to_facebook_ads_interpretation/) or [having a whole bunch of profitable plugins with objective ROI numbers to talk about](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/dsri50/my_list_of_most_profitable_plugins_on_my_shopify/), the creation of ad creatives is a very subjective topic and just requires looking at other people's ads to begin with. You can do that with paid tools or you can just find competitors you respect and see their ads at [facebook.com/ads/library](https://facebook.com/ads/library). 

Luckily, testing ad creatives and knowing which ones are actually performing well is a lot easier as there's some harder numbers there - just look for high CTR (&gt;1%), low CPC (&gt;$1), and whether there's actually any purchases above breakeven point. 

# 1. What's something immediately valuable I should know right now? 

**User generated content** (UGC) is far and away performing better universally for almost *everyone* with a reasonably successful store. Although you could spend a tonne on professional video ads, *don't.* **People are regularly disappointed by how much better UGC performs, since they spend so much more on that professional stuff.** The more native to the platform you're using, the more likely it will be a successful ad. 

When it comes to Facebook and Instagram, this means trying to get videos from people that have purchased your product before. **You can repurpose all of your reviews (or Instagram influencer videos if you have any) for your ads,** with permission of course. 

Fundamentally, UGC works at all stages of the funnel. 

# 2. Is it the right ad for the right part of the funnel? 

As I talk about in [another post I wrote about funnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/dsisc9/how_understanding_funnels_well_allows_you_to_ad/), your audience exists some part of the customer journey, but both your ad copy and image/video need to hit the right audience at the *right time.* Your ads to cold traffic should look quite different to your ads to warm traffic. 

To get more specific on what this looks like and the kinds of ads that work: 

* **Cold traffic ads** (TOFU): 
   * Needs to focus on branding, trust elements, attention-grabbing ads, and social proofing to enhance your credibility
   * If you have products that are selling really well, focus on your winners  
   * Things like single image link posts and video posts work really well 
   * Whilst collections/carousels etc. can work (and I've had them work before), I'd personally save it for MOFU/BOFU parts of the funnel 
* **Engaged audience** (MOFU)**:** 
   * Images/videos will work here too
   * However carousels/collection ads will be the new type of ad creative to include here, now that there's some familiarity, allowing your customer to really dive deep and browse your catalog more 
   * You can also start to really focus on showing **more content that shows people using your product in real life** (i.e. UGC). 
   * **Testimonials also work really well here.** 
* **Warm audience** (BOFU): 
   * Testimonials perform especially well here 
   * Discounts also perform well
   * You can combine both of these together 
   * *Dynamic creatives* that directly call out your product name from your catalog often result in a significant increase in ROAS here too 

# 3. What sort of ad copy should I write? 

The best ad copy (writing) doesn't necessarily do all of the following elements, but will almost always have at least some of them: 

* **The words you use in your ads match the words that your customers are using.** If you're new to the game, here's my pro tip: look at the reviews on Amazon of your competitors, see what specific words people are using to rave about those products, and then take some of those words and use them. 
* **Your ad calls out your customer demographic.** Most likely it's the way they like to be identified, too. So for example, if you do yoga, an ad saying ""Yogis everywhere are raving about this new fitness gear from \_"" will be more appealing than simply saying you have some new clothes in stock. **Relevancy is key.** 
   * Note that you should be careful not to go *too* overboard with this. There's no everlasting consequences from it but Facebook will disapprove ads that ""assume a customer's condition"" e.g. if you start an ad with ""Feeling sore?"" then Facebook might actually not approve that ad. 
* **Does this product solve a problem for the customer?** Call out the problem directly. 

In terms of some more specific nitty gritty details: 

* **Varying lengths all work - no particular magic here.** I've seen two liners work, full paragraphs work, and extremely long 10 paragraph copy all work for separate products. Match it to your customer and the product. 
* Stuff like emojis and links are tricks - sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but they're not universal. I've had ads perform with and without them. 

# 4. What sort of images/video/creative should I use? 

* **NOT overly professional ones.** Again, I'd like to super re-emphasize that you want UGC, *not* overdone stuff. Even if it's not actually user generated content, it should look like it. **The basic rule is: if it looks like it was shot on an iPhone and looks like it's appropriate for Instagram, then this is the right quality of image/video.**
* **Make the product at least 1/2 of the image.** It's silly to make a random coffee cup sized proportionally more than your product itself, and it does play out in terms of how well your ads perform. 
* For certain products, a bold splash of color will sometimes make a big difference. 
* For videos: fundamentally good ones are made of: 
   * An attention grabbing opening (split test these) 
   * Real usage of the product from real customers ideally 
   * Doesn't look like you're dropshipping from Aliexpress (...no matter how true that statement may or not be)  
   * They can be square or 4:5 aspect ratio, both of these work well 
* Ideas include: 
   * Testimonials
   * Demonstrations of the product 
   * GIFs showcasing your best performing *single image* creatives, all mashed together into a two frame image (powerfully simple) 
* Anecdotally, *no buttons* on a link post seem to perform better than having e.g. a 'Shop Now' button on a link post. I've only heard this from friends and haven't tested super extensively however. 
* **If using Instagram stories, make sure you're using an ad created specifically for it.** 

# 5. How much should I spend on my ads? 

This is actually a pretty tough question. 

You should generally try to have a 50x average order value worth of ad spend for a month, as a very very general rule - so for example. if your product makes you $20, then have an expectation to spend $1,000 in the month. If you don't have this kind of money, you *can* get away with less (e.g. $500), but the lower you go the lower your chance of finding a successful ad creative in time. 

Another way to think about this is to roughly spend about two times your baseline cost per acquisition per day. For example, if it usually costs you about $10 to acquire a customer through other means, then you might try to spend $20/day on Facebook ads. 

Unfortunately, it's just about rolling the dice enough times till you hit the one that really wins for you, with your money directly being the number of dice you can roll. 

That said, in terms of how you actually *run* the individual campaigns, that's a whole other topic in itself. But to keep it in general terms, you'd run some fairly low budget ad sets (e.g. $5/day) to individual ad sets in Purchase conversion campaigns, and then see what's working and what's not and do some intense optimisation from there. 

When it's working properly, it's not subtle, but actually fairly obvious. 

# Conclusion

If you read through this whole thing, you'll be miles ahead of quite a big proportion of other people doing eCommerce, or at the very least have a little bit more of a systematic approach to how you approach making Facebook ads. 

You may have read some of my previous posts before (as I particularly post a lot to /r/Shopify). 

If you like this sort of thing I'd like to be transparent and plug [this guide I wrote about an A-Z approach to Facebook marketing](https://fbadsblueprint.carrd.co/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=content_marketing&amp;utm_term=%2Fr%2Fshopify). **If you've ever wondered about what types of audiences to target, how much to spend per ad set, what sort of ad creatives work best, and those sorts of questions - then this is pretty much my brain dump to all of the above question after spending thousands on Facebook ads myself.** 

However, once again, *I've tried to make this post as valuable as possible without holding back anything.* So that even if you don't get the guide, at least you'll find something for free that you might have paid some random YouTube guru $497 (and only have gotten a fraction of that info), and that in itself is already intrinsically worthwhile. 

If you have any other insights you'd like to add or would like to disagree with, please feel free to comment below!

dropship,Winning Product #1: Magic Microfiber Towel With Full Testing Strategy Using Facebook Ads,"This week’s product is the Microfiber Glass Cleaning Towel.  

[find daily winning products](http://www.ecomhunt.com?afmc=112)

This product is selling really well on aliexpress with amazing reviews and we think that it can do really well as a dropshipping product. In this post, we’ll share with you our exact approach if we were to try and sell it on our store.

From ad examples to selling strategy, we’ve got you covered . 

This product is selling really well on aliexpress with amazing reviews and we think that it can do really well as a dropshipping product. In this post, we’ll share with you our exact approach if we were to try and sell it on our store.

From ad examples to selling strategy, we’ve got you covered

ad types =conversion&gt;purchase

 

Sometimes, we may choose the “Add to Cart” optimisation and that works too(Sometimes it can even work better than purchase optimisation). Each ad account acts differently and this is something you will have to test by yourself.

Facebook tries to scare us because we’re using a pixel with no data and warns us that we won’t get any sales. This is their way to drive us into choosing a different optimization event to milk even more money from us. They want us to start from View Content optimization and slowly progress to Purchase optimization. And by doing that we will burn a lot of money…

And we usually choose the 1 day click conversion window

 

## 2. Number of Adsets &amp; Daily Budget:

We recommend launching 3 to 5 testing adsets per campaign. You should test out different targeting options, different audiences, different ad types and not just launch 5 identical adsets.

Recommended daily budget that we successfully use: $7\~$10

 

## 3. Targeting &amp; Strategy:

Before testing any product, you need to understand who’s your target audience. In this case, we think that targeting women first is our best shot to get a sale.

But simply targeting women won’t really work… We have to choose the right interests and target those who really need this product.

We decided to test it out and target:

1. **Women who like wine** – They usually have complete sets of wine glasses and this towel is perfect to make them look sparkling brand new.
2. **Stay at home moms** – Their work is to take care of the kids and keep the house clean.
3. **General “cleaning” interests** – Interests we think someone who likes cleaning will be associated with

### Audience Size:

We usually go with audiences starting from 100k to max 1.5 million. These sizes are ideal!

**Note**: These sizes are true for Facebook feed ad placements only.

 

## 4. Ad placements:

We usually start only with Facebook feed but sometimes we can mix it up and run it also on Instagram feed. Although if we decide advertising on Instagram then we like to separate and run a new adset only for Instagram users.

It’s just something that we prefer doing but in both cases it should still work. 

We run our ads both on desktop and mobile. When we run only Instagram ads, we do it for mobile users only.

**Note**: As you see in this picture, we attached another “scare tactic” from Facebook that pushes you to basically spend more money by either raising your budget or going for a different optimization event. Do not be scared and trust us because we have spent millions on ads and so our friends. We know exactly what we’re doing!

 

It may surprise you but video ad isn’t a default ad type we launch. Sometimes a photo ad can outperform a video ad so this is something we decide based on the product. With this product, we can launch photo ads and it should work well. The customers will have no problem understanding what this product does.

We usually also prepare video ads to test it more but if you’re short on time, testing it out with a quick photo ad is ok.

 

## 6. Product Pricing &amp; Selling Strategy:

Setting a price is an important step that if done right will help you keep getting sales with a healthy conversion rate. And if done wrong, your conversion rate is going to suck or you won’t even get any sales.

I believe that most of you already understand that this product cannot be sold for $29.99 per piece. It’s not a jewelry or an electronic product that might look good enough to be bought for $4 and sold for $30+.

Probably the best price for this product will be somewhere from $9.99 to $14.99. With free shipping promotion or max $1.99/$2.49.

#### Selling Strategy:

For this product to be profitable, we will need a way to increase our AOV(Average Order Value). One of the ways to do that is offer our customers to buy more than 1 piece for a discount. This can be easily done by installing a shopify app that gives us this option. This way we may offer a considerable discount if a customer chooses to buy more than 1 piece of our magic towel. With that we have successfully increased our AOV.

For example: If we price 1 piece for $9.99 and offer 2 pieces for $16.99, our profit now will be around $10\~$11 instead of $6\~$7 if we sell only 1 piece. With a FREE SHIPPING promotion and a good product page, people will be willing to buy more than 1 piece thus increasing our AOV and total profit. And with the right audience, we may get really cheap conversions because our product isn’t that expensive.

Example of a “discount box” offered by some app in the shopify app store:",8,46,2019-11-10,ECOM,0.026439900510013103,0.6721843332052231,0.3013757821172476
shopify,How to find scalable Aliexpress products for dropshipping,"**How to Find Scalable, Winning Products On Aliexpress:**

If you're trying to get into drop shipping, you're much more likely to make money by copying what's already working. You don't need to reinvent the wheel to help you make your first successful store. . 

My strategy involves finding hot products and essentially copying what is already working. 

**STEP #1: Find Potential Products**

The first step is finding several potential products. To do this is just scroll through your Facebook newsfeed looking for dropshipping ads with lots of engagement, find whatever you can and we'll narrow it down later.

For now you just want to list of potential products that people are already advertising.

It might seem like a bad idea since that means you'll have lots of competitors before you even begin, but the truth is that competition is actually a really good sign. It shows that the product is selling and that means you should be able to sell it too. 

Before you start scrolling through your news feed, looking for products that are selling, you want to go to facebook.com/ads/preferences. Here you'll find a list of items that Facebook thinks that you're interested in.

If you see drop-shipping and AliExpress as an interest is, make sure you remove them before scrolling through your newsfeed Looking for ads. Since a lot of dropshippers want to hide their ads from other dropshippers, they'll exclude dropshipping and Ali express in their ads targeting. 

So if you skip this step, you'll miss out on a lot of potential products that you can copy. I didn't have AliExpress listed as an interest because we've been using a private supplier for a while now, but it should be listed under business and industry. If you have it, just make sure to click on see more until you get the full list of interests under this category. 

Once you have those interests removed, go to the Chrome web store and get the Turbo ad Finder extension. I know a lot of you guys have said that it's no longer working, but if you get it from the Chrome web store rather than from their website, it should work fine.

(Let me know if it doesn't because there is an alternative, but it doesn't work as well.)

Now go to the Facebook newsfeed and turn on turbo ad finder. Enabling this extension should remove any content from your newsfeed. That isn't an advertisement. This is going to save you a lot of time when you're looking for drop shipping ads as you're scrolling.

Look for any products that you can source from Ali Express. There are alternative sources for dropshipping products, but in terms of selection and price, it's hard to be at Ali, especially when you're just starting out.

AliExpress is not known for the best quality and a lot of vendors are actually pretty bad in terms of shipping things on time, but you can definitely find some quality products to drop ship on there. That's how I got started and I think it's the best place for you to get started too.

So as you’re is going through the newsfeed, here are some tips for identifying AliExpress products. 

**Tip #1 -  see if the name of the Facebook page makes sense**. If the page is called “Little Tiger” but sells folding stools, it's probably a drop shipping store. 

**Tip #2 -  Check the website.**

Most dropshipping stores are easily identified by bad product images, sales timers, and “big savings” placed everywhere.

**Tip #3 - Check the product images to see if the store is logo is printed on the product.**

If it isn't, it is most likely it's a drop shipping store and you'll easily find the same product on AliExpress.

Now that you can identify dropshipping ads, compile the list of all the ads you find by using the “save video” function on Facebook.

While you're doing this, Facebook might stop feeding you ads after you scroll fully awhile. If that happens, you should just refresh the page to get a new set of ads. 

Now once you have your list of at least five different dropshipping ads, you're ready for the next step and step two will be about how to go through our list and narrow it down to the best products.

(And just in case you think that these products can't be sourced from Ali express, I found listings for each product). 

**These are the products I found** 

1. Baby Diaper Bag
2. Folding Stool
3. Custom Dog Harness
4. Mini Projector
5. Hexagon Tiles
6. Smart Fitness Watch.

**HOW TO DETERMINE IF A PRODUCT IS LIKELY TO BE SCALABLE (i.e. A Good Choice)**

**#1 Check the # Of Ad Views**

Now once you have a list of ads like the ones we found, the first thing you should do is check the number of views on the ad. 

All views aren't the most accurate measurement for telling if the product is selling well. However. If an ad has over a million views, it's probably selling at least somewhat well. The reason it's not too accurate is because worldwide views are dirt cheap, especially when you're running a PPE campaign, but a million views is a good indicator that they're running more than just PPE campaigns. 

From our list of ads, the custom dog harness and the smart fitness watch were the only ones that had over a million views.

We won't exclude the other products from our list yet. We'll just note that these two products might be doing the best. 

**#2 : Look at The Facebook Page Running The Advertisement**

If the page is over a thousand likes AND it's been running for more than three months, then it's probably doing pretty well.

Since people can buy fake likes for their Facebook page, you shouldn't use this as an absolute indicator that the store is doing well either, but in our experience, most people, including ourselves don't buy fake “likes” for our store pages. 

Either way, you should use the number of page likes as a way to weed out weed products for six examples. 

The baby diaper bag has close to 4,000 likes and has been running for about a year plus the engagement on some other page posts. Show that the page likes are legit.

We'll keep this on the list. 

The folding stool page only has 700 hundred likes but has been running for close to half a year. That's close enough. We'll keep it on the list for now as well. 

The light up Hexagon Tiles only has a few likes and just sort of running the page which makes me skeptical about the product. I'm probably going to take it off the list, but just to make sure, I'll take a quick look at Ali Express and see how it's doing. 

The hottest listing only has a couple of hundred sales, which is not good. You want items that have multiple listings with over 8,000 orders.

On these Hexagon tiles, The pricing was also way too high at $25 for four pieces, meaning I would have to sell them for at least $50 and even then margins will be raised at and the product will be overpriced. In my opinion. Lightup hexagon tiles are looking like the best option, so I'll cross it off the list.

The smart fitness watch pages over 5,000 likes and has been running for a year and a half. These metrics look really good and their marketing angle is really interesting. They're selling it as a product for veterans and veteran supporters. I'll keep this one on the list for sure. 

The mini projector has 1200 likes and has been running for a month and a half. They also seem to have German and French versions of their store, which is really interesting since they probably wouldn't expand it to these markets until their English markets were doing well. I'm thinking this is a pretty viral product, so I'll keep it on the list. 

Lastly, the custom dog harness pageas been running for over eight year with over 7,000 page likes. I'll definitely keep an eye out for this one as well. 

So far the only products that we have crossed off the list is the lightup hexagon tiles

You don't want to be too picky about your options at this point because you'll want multiple choices for the final selection process. 

**#3 - Look at the other ads that the pages are running for each of your products.**

Go to the Facebook page and under “transparency”. Click on “See More”, then go to the ads library for the page. 

You should look for a few different things here:

1. How long they've been running the same creative. 
2. How many different as they have for the same product 
3. How hard they are scaling. 

Unfortunately, you'll only be able to get reliable information on this when an ad features a Bitly link. I'll show you how shortly.

**Diaper Bag**

They've been running the same ads since September and they also have a few different variations of the creative.

These are both really good signs since they wouldn't keep running their ads if they were losing money. 

Plus the fact that they released all these videos on the same day and kept running, that means that the product is great at selling itself. If the product wasn't great at selling, they would have only been able to get one or two of these creatives to work. Not all of them. This is looking like a potential winner. 

**Folding Stool**

Looking at the page for the folding stool, it looks like they're testing three different thumbnails, but they don't have multiple different videos running. 

The only other ad they're running is a children's toy. The fact that they're testing multiple items combined with the fact that they just started running these ads, it makes me think that they're still in the testing phase. 

Also, notice that there are Bitly Links. Whenever you see a Bitly link, usually copy and paste the link in your browser with a “+” sign at the end to check for traffic.

It will show you the number of link clicks over time, and we found that they weren’t really pushing big numbers.

I'll also take a look at their website to see why they can't scale since I think that both the product and ad actually aren't too bad. Just looking at their pricing, it's pretty obvious where they aren't selling. 50 bucks is way too expensive for this stool.. 

We'll go ahead and cross the stool one off the list.

**Smart Fitness Watch:**

We see that they're testing three new products. They've been running the fitness watch for over a month and have several different ads running for it, and have ads for other item(s) running as well.

It looks like they're doing really well and are just looking to find more products to sell. This product is definitely looking really promising. 

**Mini projector.** 

It looks like they've ran their active  ads for less than a week. They have one ad for cold traffic and another for retargeting. 

This doesn't look too good, but we'll keep it on the list for now. I'm guessing with the number of page likes they've been able to gather in such a short amount of time. 

This product is actually doing really well. Plus running a retargeting campaign. It's really only effective once you've scaled to at least a few hundred dollars per day in ad spend. 

Like I said, you want to keep your options open for the funnel phase of selection. 

**Custom Dog Harness**

They have ads that have been running since April.

They also have tons of different variations for their creative they even haven't had with the vertical format building. 

They must've been scaling pretty high to include the creative specifically for Instagram story ads.

Without a doubt, the dog harness is selling really well.

After looking at the Facebook Ad Library we have four products left on the list:

Diaper bag, 

Fitness watch

Mini projector 

Dog harness.

**#4: Check Aliexpress Orders**

They're all definitely selling, but now we're looking for the best option to narrow it down to one product. You should go to AliExpress, look up each of your products and sort by orders here. 

We'll try to weigh a few different factors to come up with the best product to sell. You should be looking at the following things:

1. Margin
2. Number of orders
3. Media Content 
4. Quality. 

Each of them are important to consider. Margins are the biggest factor when it comes to scaling high.

**MARGINS**

Since your advertising cost per purchase will increase as you scale budgets. Operating a razor thin margins won't give you much room to grow. That is if you can even get low margin products to be profitable.

I like to look for products that I can sell for at least 300% of the product costs. With absolute margins being at least $25.

**NUMBER (#) OF ORDERS** 

The number of orders on a product shows that it sells well online and that it probably can't be found at stores too easily. 

Personally, I like to sell items that have at least a few thousand orders already because that means it's been tested before. Plus reviews mean a lot more when a listing has a few thousand orders. 

Since it's hard to inflate ratings with so many real customers, you should know that having multiple listings with thousands of orders is also a really good sign and suppliers on AliExpress tend to hop on products that sell well.

**MEDIA CONTENT**

The amount of copyright free media content is important when it comes to making your website and advertisements. While you can get away with using YouTube videos and other copyrighted media for some time, I would highly recommend looking for items that have media content ready to use.

Having a lot of content readily available from Chinese suppliers is also a good sign that the product is selling well. Since suppliers want to invest into making photos or videos unless the product has a good sales record. 

**QUALITY**

Sure, you can make a quick buck selling subpar items, but you'll never be able to have a sustainable store. Since Facebook is rolling out surveys to buyers quickly these days, they all know when customers are upset with what they receive. You'll also have to deal with way more customer service requests.

Then you work with the product that customers are happy with, with enough chargebacks. This could result in large holds on your payments or the events from Facebook, Shopify and your payment processors and the, and this can mean you will never be able to try drop shipping again.

You should use these factors to get an overall picture for each product and then try to compare them. 

There is no absolute formula for this. You just want to go with what feels like the best option. So let's take a look at each of the four products we have left. 

**DIAPER BAG -  FINAL ANALYSIS**

Starting with a diaper bag. I see that they're selling for $17 and I think I can definitely sell them for at least $50 which will leave me with about $33 to spend on ads. It's not the best margins but definitely doable. The number of orders on the top listing is over 11,000 so this has definitely been selling super well and there's also several other listings with over a thousand orders in terms of media content available for the bag, I see that the biggest listing, which is the one I would probably sell as really great product images, which I can definitely use for my ads and my site.

There's also a ton of other listings with similar bags that I can take photos and videos from. This would be great for making some high quality ads without coming up with my own videos and without running the risk of taking copyrighted media. 

Plus these bags must be selling really well for so many suppliers to be creating their own content. Looking at the reviews for this bag, it looks like it's a really good quality with 4.9 stars and the supplier is considered a top brand, meaning shipping times. I'd probably fast and reliable for Allie express standards. I definitely don't imagine running into any problems with people dissatisfied about the product. With this one overall, the bag looks like a good candidate with lots of sales, tons of media content, and great reviews. The only part that's not too good is the margins, but it's not too bad either.

**SMART WATCH - FINAL ANALYSIS**

Looking at the listings for this product, it looks like these watches are only $9 at most. Meaning margins could be upwards of 500% at a minimum or about $36 conservatively. This would be great for scaling. There are a good amount of orders on these listings, but not as many as the bag. This surprises me since I know that these watches are probably selling way more units and has me a little skeptical about the quality of the product

You should know that with low quality products and especially electronics suppliers will remove listings after reviews drop too low, they will then reopen the same listing, pick the first a hundred or so reviews. Then rinse and repeat. As far as media content goes, it looks like there are plenty of listings with a wide variety of photos and videos available.

Just like the bag,  This would be great for my website and ads. 

Now back to the quality of the watches which has me concerned -  the reviews are ranging from a 4.3 to 4.7 but that's not too great considering how many orders are on each of the listings. I have a strong suspicion that these reviews are faked. 

Plus I'm careful about electronics because I know they're usually not the best quality in this price range. Considering these watches are meant to be waterproof and continued variety of sensors for heartbeat and blood pressure, I'm going to say that these will probably get me in trouble later down the line, especially if I'm trying to sell them at the margins I was predicting. I'm going to cross the Smart Watches off the list since I don't want to run into any Facebook or Shopify trouble with this store and other stores associated with my name.

**MINI PROJECTOR - FINAL ANALYSIS**

Next up is the mini projector. Before we go over all the details again, it looks like there's only one listing with good enough margins and the reviews for it are not that great.

I'm also very skeptical with the quality of this product since it looks like all the other listings are at least three times the cost plus the one potential listing doesn't have too much media content that I can use. 

I would probably have to make my own video or run the risk of using pieces of the ad from earlier, which I would rather not do. I'm going to go ahead and cross this one off the list for questionable quality as well. 

**CUSTOM DOG HARNESS - FINAL ANALYSIS**

Last up is the custom dog harness. These harnesses locally, they would have really good margins if we sold them for $50 which I think is super reasonable at that price I would have $40 for ads, which I think is plenty for a custom product like this.

The number of orders on this product aren't the best, but there are multiple listings with a couple thousand orders, so this doesn't concern me. 

In terms of media content, there really isn't much for this product. There are a few photos but nothing that really showcases a dog wearing the harness. Well, looking at the store advertising the harness, it looks like they have a lot of original photos and videos were both their advertisements and store. If I were to sell this, I definitely have to come up with my own photos and videos to use. The quality looks on point with a 4.8 almost all the listings for this product with all the photo reviews. I'm not really concerned about fake reviews for this one and unlike electronics, I don't think a harness will break too easily.

**FINAL SELECTION:**

In the end it comes down to a baby diaper bag that has great video content, but okay Margins OR a dog harness with virtually no media content, and slightly higher margins

Both the products look like their quality is on point. If you are in this situation, you could pick either one and I think it will be a great choice as long as you knew that the dog harness will require a little more work with having to take some photos and videos. 

I provide a visual breakdown of this process here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7SZpaUX4uA&amp;t=288s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7SZpaUX4uA&amp;t=288s)",13,36,2019-11-10,ECOM,0.08318209275603294,0.8867988228797913,0.03001912496984005
dropship,Is there a store checklist you go by before launching a store?,"Hello everyone!

My partner and I are close to launching our own dropshipping store through Shopify. I'm very ""attention to detail"" orientated and wanted to see if there was a guide or checklist some of you followed before launching a store to ensure launch is as effective as can be? Perhaps even some information on what the to sure you're doing after launch?

ecommerce,Had a wix site for 5 years and finally wanna switch to Shopify to tie it to the POS of the stores we have. What’s the best way to approach this?,"I work for a company that is afraid of technology. Yet, they have had clover systems in multiple locations. They don’t know the true power behind a smart POS system. 

I maintain the separate online business for the same set of stores and my huge issue is always inventory. A customer orders an item I uploaded last week, and we end up not having it. The president also will not have the site carry its own inventory. It’s a bit old school. And we all know how time consuming it is to keep paper or sheet inventories and trust the store managers enough to send accurate data. 

So my plan for a while now has been to pick one store.  Hire some people to inventory and snap photos of all the SKUs and tie this in with my e-commerce  by using Shopify and clover. 

The head office does not like change however, and giving them any ounce of extra work, or having to learn something new they are very hesitant about. So it has to be implemented very user friendly and can not stir the water too much for ordering etc. that’s why I believe if I just connect to one store and the manager can ship, I can sit back and watch the sales come in and focus on design and marketing as opposed to tracking down an item for hours by calling stores. 

At the end of it all, my percentage of sales pays for the gas and shipping it takes to even make the sale possible in the first place.  

So, having a six site with around 200+ products, what would be the best way to implement this transition?

dropship,Receiving payments when you're outside the US,"Hello everyone, I've started my store a little while ago, as I was doing an intensive project research.

My question is,

Also, I have a United States bank account, a Registered LLC with an EIN, and a physical address in the US and I would like to receive my payments into that bank account. 

Finally, when I tried to activate Shopify I was able to provide my address and EIN and Legal name of the company, but I couldn't fill in the SSN as I don't have one.

I do offer sales and discounts, but really dont feel like running a discount game is what I want to do. I am also interested in the front page layout, if you know any tweaks for a better funnel/flow  in customers journey.

dropship,How to find scalable Aliexpress products for dropshipping,"**How to Find Scalable, Winning Products On Aliexpress:**

If you're trying to get into drop shipping, you're much more likely to make money by copying what's already working. You don't need to reinvent the wheel to help you make your first successful store. .

My strategy involves finding hot products and essentially copying what is already working.

**STEP #1: Find Potential Products**

The first step is finding several potential products. To do this is just scroll through your Facebook newsfeed looking for dropshipping ads with lots of engagement, find whatever you can and we'll narrow it down later.

For now you just want to list of potential products that people are already advertising.

It might seem like a bad idea since that means you'll have lots of competitors before you even begin, but the truth is that competition is actually a really good sign. It shows that the product is selling and that means you should be able to sell it too.

Before you start scrolling through your news feed, looking for products that are selling, you want to go to facebook.com/ads/preferences. Here you'll find a list of items that Facebook thinks that you're interested in.

If you see drop-shipping and AliExpress as an interest is, make sure you remove them before scrolling through your newsfeed Looking for ads. Since a lot of dropshippers want to hide their ads from other dropshippers, they'll exclude dropshipping and Ali express in their ads targeting.

So if you skip this step, you'll miss out on a lot of potential products that you can copy. I didn't have AliExpress listed as an interest because we've been using a private supplier for a while now, but it should be listed under business and industry. If you have it, just make sure to click on see more until you get the full list of interests under this category.

Once you have those interests removed, go to the Chrome web store and get the Turbo ad Finder extension. I know a lot of you guys have said that it's no longer working, but if you get it from the Chrome web store rather than from their website, it should work fine.

(Let me know if it doesn't because there is an alternative, but it doesn't work as well.)

Now go to the Facebook newsfeed and turn on turbo ad finder. Enabling this extension should remove any content from your newsfeed. That isn't an advertisement. This is going to save you a lot of time when you're looking for drop shipping ads as you're scrolling.

Look for any products that you can source from Ali Express. There are alternative sources for dropshipping products, but in terms of selection and price, it's hard to be at Ali, especially when you're just starting out.

AliExpress is not known for the best quality and a lot of vendors are actually pretty bad in terms of shipping things on time, but you can definitely find some quality products to drop ship on there. That's how I got started and I think it's the best place for you to get started too.

So as you’re is going through the newsfeed, here are some tips for identifying AliExpress products.

**Tip #1 -  see if the name of the Facebook page makes sense**. If the page is called “Little Tiger” but sells folding stools, it's probably a drop shipping store.

**Tip #2 -  Check the website.**

Most dropshipping stores are easily identified by bad product images, sales timers, and “big savings” placed everywhere.

**Tip #3 - Check the product images to see if the store is logo is printed on the product.**

If it isn't, it is most likely it's a drop shipping store and you'll easily find the same product on AliExpress.

Now that you can identify dropshipping ads, compile the list of all the ads you find by using the “save video” function on Facebook.

While you're doing this, Facebook might stop feeding you ads after you scroll fully awhile. If that happens, you should just refresh the page to get a new set of ads.

Now once you have your list of at least five different dropshipping ads, you're ready for the next step and step two will be about how to go through our list and narrow it down to the best products.

(And just in case you think that these products can't be sourced from Ali express, I found listings for each product).

**These are the products I found**

1. Baby Diaper Bag
2. Folding Stool
3. Custom Dog Harness
4. Mini Projector
5. Hexagon Tiles
6. Smart Fitness Watch.

**HOW TO DETERMINE IF A PRODUCT IS LIKELY TO BE SCALABLE (i.e. A Good Choice)**

**#1 Check the # Of Ad Views**

Now once you have a list of ads like the ones we found, the first thing you should do is check the number of views on the ad.

All views aren't the most accurate measurement for telling if the product is selling well. However. If an ad has over a million views, it's probably selling at least somewhat well. The reason it's not too accurate is because worldwide views are dirt cheap, especially when you're running a PPE campaign, but a million views is a good indicator that they're running more than just PPE campaigns.

From our list of ads, the custom dog harness and the smart fitness watch were the only ones that had over a million views.

We won't exclude the other products from our list yet. We'll just note that these two products might be doing the best.

**#2 : Look at The Facebook Page Running The Advertisement**

If the page is over a thousand likes AND it's been running for more than three months, then it's probably doing pretty well.

Since people can buy fake likes for their Facebook page, you shouldn't use this as an absolute indicator that the store is doing well either, but in our experience, most people, including ourselves don't buy fake “likes” for our store pages.

Either way, you should use the number of page likes as a way to weed out weed products for six examples.

The baby diaper bag has close to 4,000 likes and has been running for about a year plus the engagement on some other page posts. Show that the page likes are legit.

We'll keep this on the list.

The folding stool page only has 700 hundred likes but has been running for close to half a year. That's close enough. We'll keep it on the list for now as well.

The light up Hexagon Tiles only has a few likes and just sort of running the page which makes me skeptical about the product. I'm probably going to take it off the list, but just to make sure, I'll take a quick look at Ali Express and see how it's doing.

The hottest listing only has a couple of hundred sales, which is not good. You want items that have multiple listings with over 8,000 orders.

On these Hexagon tiles, The pricing was also way too high at $25 for four pieces, meaning I would have to sell them for at least $50 and even then margins will be raised at and the product will be overpriced. In my opinion. Lightup hexagon tiles are looking like the best option, so I'll cross it off the list.

The smart fitness watch pages over 5,000 likes and has been running for a year and a half. These metrics look really good and their marketing angle is really interesting. They're selling it as a product for veterans and veteran supporters. I'll keep this one on the list for sure.

The mini projector has 1200 likes and has been running for a month and a half. They also seem to have German and French versions of their store, which is really interesting since they probably wouldn't expand it to these markets until their English markets were doing well. I'm thinking this is a pretty viral product, so I'll keep it on the list.

Lastly, the custom dog harness pageas been running for over eight year with over 7,000 page likes. I'll definitely keep an eye out for this one as well.

So far the only products that we have crossed off the list is the lightup hexagon tiles

You don't want to be too picky about your options at this point because you'll want multiple choices for the final selection process.

**#3 - Look at the other ads that the pages are running for each of your products.**

Go to the Facebook page and under “transparency”. Click on “See More”, then go to the ads library for the page.

You should look for a few different things here:

1. How long they've been running the same creative.
2. How many different as they have for the same product
3. How hard they are scaling.

Unfortunately, you'll only be able to get reliable information on this when an ad features a Bitly link. I'll show you how shortly.

**Diaper Bag**

They've been running the same ads since September and they also have a few different variations of the creative.

These are both really good signs since they wouldn't keep running their ads if they were losing money.

Plus the fact that they released all these videos on the same day and kept running, that means that the product is great at selling itself. If the product wasn't great at selling, they would have only been able to get one or two of these creatives to work. Not all of them. This is looking like a potential winner.

**Folding Stool**

Looking at the page for the folding stool, it looks like they're testing three different thumbnails, but they don't have multiple different videos running.

The only other ad they're running is a children's toy. The fact that they're testing multiple items combined with the fact that they just started running these ads, it makes me think that they're still in the testing phase.

Also, notice that there are Bitly Links. Whenever you see a Bitly link, usually copy and paste the link in your browser with a “+” sign at the end to check for traffic.

It will show you the number of link clicks over time, and we found that they weren’t really pushing big numbers.

I'll also take a look at their website to see why they can't scale since I think that both the product and ad actually aren't too bad. Just looking at their pricing, it's pretty obvious where they aren't selling. 50 bucks is way too expensive for this stool..

We'll go ahead and cross the stool one off the list.

**Smart Fitness Watch:**

We see that they're testing three new products. They've been running the fitness watch for over a month and have several different ads running for it, and have ads for other item(s) running as well.

It looks like they're doing really well and are just looking to find more products to sell. This product is definitely looking really promising.

**Mini projector.**

It looks like they've ran their active  ads for less than a week. They have one ad for cold traffic and another for retargeting.

This doesn't look too good, but we'll keep it on the list for now. I'm guessing with the number of page likes they've been able to gather in such a short amount of time.

This product is actually doing really well. Plus running a retargeting campaign. It's really only effective once you've scaled to at least a few hundred dollars per day in ad spend.

Like I said, you want to keep your options open for the funnel phase of selection.

**Custom Dog Harness**

They have ads that have been running since April.

They also have tons of different variations for their creative they even haven't had with the vertical format building.

They must've been scaling pretty high to include the creative specifically for Instagram story ads.

Without a doubt, the dog harness is selling really well.

After looking at the Facebook Ad Library we have four products left on the list:

Diaper bag,

Fitness watch

Mini projector

Dog harness.

**#4: Check Aliexpress Orders**

They're all definitely selling, but now we're looking for the best option to narrow it down to one product. You should go to AliExpress, look up each of your products and sort by orders here.

We'll try to weigh a few different factors to come up with the best product to sell. You should be looking at the following things:

1. Margin
2. Number of orders
3. Media Content
4. Quality.

Each of them are important to consider. Margins are the biggest factor when it comes to scaling high.

**MARGINS**

Since your advertising cost per purchase will increase as you scale budgets. Operating a razor thin margins won't give you much room to grow. That is if you can even get low margin products to be profitable.

I like to look for products that I can sell for at least 300% of the product costs. With absolute margins being at least $25.

**NUMBER (#) OF ORDERS**

The number of orders on a product shows that it sells well online and that it probably can't be found at stores too easily.

Personally, I like to sell items that have at least a few thousand orders already because that means it's been tested before. Plus reviews mean a lot more when a listing has a few thousand orders.

Since it's hard to inflate ratings with so many real customers, you should know that having multiple listings with thousands of orders is also a really good sign and suppliers on AliExpress tend to hop on products that sell well.

**MEDIA CONTENT**

The amount of copyright free media content is important when it comes to making your website and advertisements. While you can get away with using YouTube videos and other copyrighted media for some time, I would highly recommend looking for items that have media content ready to use.

Having a lot of content readily available from Chinese suppliers is also a good sign that the product is selling well. Since suppliers want to invest into making photos or videos unless the product has a good sales record.

**QUALITY**

Sure, you can make a quick buck selling subpar items, but you'll never be able to have a sustainable store. Since Facebook is rolling out surveys to buyers quickly these days, they all know when customers are upset with what they receive. You'll also have to deal with way more customer service requests.

Then you work with the product that customers are happy with, with enough chargebacks. This could result in large holds on your payments or the events from Facebook, Shopify and your payment processors and the, and this can mean you will never be able to try drop shipping again.

You should use these factors to get an overall picture for each product and then try to compare them.

There is no absolute formula for this. You just want to go with what feels like the best option. So let's take a look at each of the four products we have left.

**DIAPER BAG -  FINAL ANALYSIS**

Starting with a diaper bag. I see that they're selling for $17 and I think I can definitely sell them for at least $50 which will leave me with about $33 to spend on ads. It's not the best margins but definitely doable. The number of orders on the top listing is over 11,000 so this has definitely been selling super well and there's also several other listings with over a thousand orders in terms of media content available for the bag, I see that the biggest listing, which is the one I would probably sell as really great product images, which I can definitely use for my ads and my site.

There's also a ton of other listings with similar bags that I can take photos and videos from. This would be great for making some high quality ads without coming up with my own videos and without running the risk of taking copyrighted media.

Plus these bags must be selling really well for so many suppliers to be creating their own content. Looking at the reviews for this bag, it looks like it's a really good quality with 4.9 stars and the supplier is considered a top brand, meaning shipping times. I'd probably fast and reliable for Allie express standards. I definitely don't imagine running into any problems with people dissatisfied about the product. With this one overall, the bag looks like a good candidate with lots of sales, tons of media content, and great reviews. The only part that's not too good is the margins, but it's not too bad either.

**SMART WATCH - FINAL ANALYSIS**

Looking at the listings for this product, it looks like these watches are only $9 at most. Meaning margins could be upwards of 500% at a minimum or about $36 conservatively. This would be great for scaling. There are a good amount of orders on these listings, but not as many as the bag. This surprises me since I know that these watches are probably selling way more units and has me a little skeptical about the quality of the product

You should know that with low quality products and especially electronics suppliers will remove listings after reviews drop too low, they will then reopen the same listing, pick the first a hundred or so reviews. Then rinse and repeat. As far as media content goes, it looks like there are plenty of listings with a wide variety of photos and videos available.

Just like the bag,  This would be great for my website and ads.

Now back to the quality of the watches which has me concerned -  the reviews are ranging from a 4.3 to 4.7 but that's not too great considering how many orders are on each of the listings. I have a strong suspicion that these reviews are faked.

Plus I'm careful about electronics because I know they're usually not the best quality in this price range. Considering these watches are meant to be waterproof and continued variety of sensors for heartbeat and blood pressure, I'm going to say that these will probably get me in trouble later down the line, especially if I'm trying to sell them at the margins I was predicting. I'm going to cross the Smart Watches off the list since I don't want to run into any Facebook or Shopify trouble with this store and other stores associated with my name.

**MINI PROJECTOR - FINAL ANALYSIS**

Next up is the mini projector. Before we go over all the details again, it looks like there's only one listing with good enough margins and the reviews for it are not that great.

I'm also very skeptical with the quality of this product since it looks like all the other listings are at least three times the cost plus the one potential listing doesn't have too much media content that I can use.

I would probably have to make my own video or run the risk of using pieces of the ad from earlier, which I would rather not do. I'm going to go ahead and cross this one off the list for questionable quality as well.

**CUSTOM DOG HARNESS - FINAL ANALYSIS**

Last up is the custom dog harness. These harnesses locally, they would have really good margins if we sold them for $50 which I think is super reasonable at that price I would have $40 for ads, which I think is plenty for a custom product like this.

The number of orders on this product aren't the best, but there are multiple listings with a couple thousand orders, so this doesn't concern me.

In terms of media content, there really isn't much for this product. There are a few photos but nothing that really showcases a dog wearing the harness. Well, looking at the store advertising the harness, it looks like they have a lot of original photos and videos were both their advertisements and store. If I were to sell this, I definitely have to come up with my own photos and videos to use. The quality looks on point with a 4.8 almost all the listings for this product with all the photo reviews. I'm not really concerned about fake reviews for this one and unlike electronics, I don't think a harness will break too easily.

**FINAL SELECTION:**

In the end it comes down to a baby diaper bag that has great video content, but okay Margins OR a dog harness with virtually no media content, and slightly higher margins

Both the products look like their quality is on point. If you are in this situation, you could pick either one and I think it will be a great choice as long as you knew that the dog harness will require a little more work with having to take some photos and videos.

ecommerce,So Paypal lost another customer today...,"Everyone's aware about new Paypal policies about fees. They simply steal them now. Over the weekend a customer bought a $1600 product from me, and oops, it's discontinued. I try to keep site updated pricewise/availability wise the best way I can. Not in this case though. Factory didn't notify about this one being disco.  Sometimes people are hunting for those discontinued models and buying them with hope they still exist somewhere and in year I have a few sales of this nature (""I've been searching for this everywhere, found it here and paid""). Well, lost $50+ dollars just like that. Called PP. They won't be doing anything about it. Of course. 'Sorry' they said. So, yes, I'm sorry too, but Paypal is no longer accepted on my site. 

P.S. A part of the problem is also PP doesn't have a 'authorized' state so I can decide myself if I'm charging transaction or not. It just charges right away. Lady from PP told me it's actually possible but didn't explain how. At this moment I'm really pissed on PP and won't be digging into this, but if someone can confirm authorization/charge flow possible with them, I'd look into this in the future.

dropship,"Learning about dropshipping and ecommerce, i have a few question..","Obligatory apology for a newbie post. 

Some time ago i stumbled on concept of dropshipping and got interested in it and ecommerce, so i decided to look more into it and got quite hooked on the concept.

I read quite a bit about it and watched videos explaining different things. I'm not hoping for a get-rich-scheme, but see it as a way to run a business, requiring a particular set of skills and a possibility to learn some things along the way. 

Now, I believe in learning things my self. And every day I'm putting hours to aquire the skills necessary for dropshipping successfully. I've studied selling, persuasion and marketing psychology and cold reading. Right now I'm learning about SoMe, related strategies, creative content, design and branding. Next step for me will be learning how to do proper market and niche research, product testing, and proper financial management. And I'm open for looking into other subjects when I stumble upon more I need to get better at. 

With this strategy, I aspire to be as prepared as possible when i actually start and when making mistakes, be able to learn from them faster. If I decide to move on to do something else, I'll have skills to do so. I even applied for jobs in telemarketing to get experience with selling and customer service.

Is that a decent strategy or are there things i've missed?


And just out of curiosity. I've seen a lot of gurus selling courses. Most have mixed reviews ranging from being hyped to claims that all info is available elsewhere on the internet for free.

I've looked in to some courses but as I'm learning on my own, some courses began to look offputting. Now hear me out. I believe some might be truely good for speeding up learning proces and provide good information. But it looks like some youtubers are almost selling their courses as if they were get rich quick schemes, shortcuts to a dream. They offer some techniques, yet in their own funnels use tricks that they don't even mention.
Are there courses that are worth looking into?",9,5,2019-11-11,ECOM,0.02974221669137478,0.9301797151565552,0.04007809981703758

shopify,"So, um.....ever find an exact duplicate/mirror of your site/store?","This is really unusual. I've found an exact duplicate of our store. It has a similar domain name, and has mirrored our theme, all images, product entries and more.

I have no idea how this is happening. If I update our site, the spoofed site updates (product entries, /page/ content, etc). It has a Checkout page that looks just like ours. I used the Contact form, and the email came back to our store oddly. It even has the same plugins/apps, like the search we use.

It's definitely not ours, we don't own the other domain name, and if I go through the checkout process, it doesn't leave an abandoned cart in our store. Our IP is identified as Shopify, but the spoof is Cloudflare.

The domain was registered a couple weeks ago, and it was discovered looking up some info on an item we carry - seeing an entry in Google that is identical to our own, but a slightly different domain.

I've started trying to get help from Shopify, only thing they've said so far is it isn't a Shopify site/account. I'm a bit dubious. Awaiting a response from higher up.

It's worrying this can happen - if someone happens upon one of these links, they might think it's us, and go through the Checkout process, likely giving info and CC data to an unknown and nefarious entity.

I've never seen anything quite like this - how are they mirroring our site so perfectly? Can someone gain access to our Shopify assets and essentially plug into our database and pull our product info, etc, and publish it all on another domain? (How much more info can they access??) How did they duplicate our theme, including our customized edits/tweaks? How can they be pulling our assets without raising HTTPS flags? Comparing the code it's nearly identical - image files refer to the same URLs, so they're pulling our assets, not assets located elsewhere or with different filenames.

Is there a way to verify if a site you're visiting is actually on Shopify?

If you want to check it out, our domain is [vegansupply.ca](https://vegansupply.ca) \- the spoof is vegansupplyco dot club. (Not listing the complete URL to avoid any further promotion or linkage of this fraud site.) Will be submitting abuse claims to shut it down shortly, but hoping to answer some questions and figure out as much of this as possible, hopefully prevent it from happening again - this could become something really bad.

The company I work with is tech manufacturer looking to partner with dropshippers who will carry our products.

dropship,I've sold $1150 my first two weeks drop-shipping,"Figured I'd share considering there's not too many ""successful"" posts on here.

I started designing my store 3 weeks ago. Worked like 60 hours in a week, added over 500 products from Oberlo, wrote custom descriptions/titles for each item (with a decent amount of copy and paste here and there), spent 20 hours designing the storefront (bought a good theme from Themeforest), created custom graphics/images and content writing, wrote a few blog posts related to my niche. My site is FULLY FLESHED OUT. I get paid $65/hr to design other people's stores, so it isn't something I'm new at.

I actually get a little sad seeing people post their sites here, because a lot of them look like a few hours or less was put into them. Please don't waste your money on ads if you aren't going to take the design process seriously. People will NOT BUY FROM YOUR STORE IF IT LOOKS BAD. Your product doesn't even MATTER if your site looks bad. They will take a split second look and leave. Check your bounce rate. Is is higher then 80%? It's your load time or design. My bounce rate is 45%. Shopify has one of the FASTEST development times out there, because of how simple it is. I've put together people's sites in less than 10 hours. If you can afford it, go spend like $200-$300 on a designer at Upwork that has worked on Shopify stores in the past. It's great that people come here looking for advice, because it means they are trying to improve, but work on your stores a bit more first. /rant sorry

A week later I opened my store and started running Facebook ads. While I do design stores for a living, I've never done any Facebook marketing before. I wasted a lot of $$$ over the last two weeks targeting traffic instead of purchase conversions and figuring out how to properly split test. I only just recently figured out the actual differences between campaign/ad set/ad (lol).

Now, for the numbers QQ. I'm profitable at 20%. My margins are 60% after product costs, and then 40% is spent on ads. My CPC for my purchase campaign is 28 cents, and cost per purchase is $6. I'm only spending $25 a day on ads and getting a few sales a day. These numbers include my failed ads. With my new ads at $6 a purchase, my margins are 30%.

Of course, now it's really just a waiting game. I'm scared as heck to ""scale"" properly so I'm not going to touch the Facebook ads, other than turning off the losers (running a split test right now) for another month probably. Part of that is because while I do use epacket for shipping, shipping times can still be 2-3 weeks, and paypal is ""holding"" my money until the products get marked as ""delivered"" in tracking. So while I'm spending money buying products to ship, when people use Paypal I don't get anything back for up to 3 weeks. I'm supposed to buy a house soon and can't have all my money being ""held"" in Paypal as I attempt to scale. BAH.

Just... wanted to share my progress/story. You can be profitable right out the gate. I went even at first because I didn't know what I was doing marketing wise.

ecommerce,Shapeways alternatives for a jewelry e-commerce business?,"I'm planning to launch an ecommerce business that will (among other things) sell unique jewelry designs which I've created as 3d models and will be fabricated by a 3rd party. I'm looking for manufacturing options, preferably based in North America, that offer direct fulfillment on a per single item order basis that are similar to what Shapeways offers, and that ideally also have a Shopify integration. My best option is currently Shapeways, but since they only offer branded packaging options if you sell at least 5000 items per month, and I prefer to launch the brand with strong branding right from the start, I'm looking to find other companies that offer similar services. I want to make sure that Shapeways is my best option. If I can't find a comparable alternative, I'll probably still work with Shapeways but offer the jewelry items as preorder and/or small batch runs, and then do the packaging and shipping myself until I reach the volume of sales at which Shapeways will work with me on custom packaging. But if anyone knows who Shapeways's competitors might be, let me know! I want to choose the best option for my business and learn to work with them sooner rather than later.

Decided I wanted to get off platforms and setup my own Shopify store. Debated between niche store vs general store / trending products. While I think niche probably is better for longterm, it seems it's a longer building process and more work as well so opted for the genera/fad store and figured if I have a lot of success with a particular product I can always transition to or open another niche store around that product or niche. 

I've been trying different products, running different ad sets for about 3 months, no luck, not a single sale.

While many of the stores were fashion and more ""hip"" categories, I saw a lot of stores selling boring but more practical items. I began digging into this further, searching Google for things like ""replacement ikea parts shopify"" or ""replacement crock pot knob shopify"" just randomly looking for things.

I began spying on stores, looking around, I had some ideas but hadn't really taken any action. A buddy mentioned to me he was using [ShopInspect](

dropship,"1000$ Facebook ads lesson, but now on the right track 8 orders today already.","After being all amped up by our youtube guru's saying ""just go do it"" I did.......

First lesson I learned is, if you have a good Idea and hire someone on fiver to do some sort of work toward the product. Know this may be a way for them to do product research and get paid while doing it, let that sink in. 

I had a video made on fiver was very pleased with it for the price, quality ect. I get some ads going I start doing competitor research when I find a extremely close name to mine selling the same product. Now this would not really be a big deal but I looked at the ad's, same style, same watermark, but just a little better. I looked at the fiverr providers reviews to see if someone left a review for that video ""they show in the reviews"" Nope. 

Second lesson I learned, facebook ads takes a strategy that is not really learned off youtube videos. The ad sectors need to be researched just as much as the product itself. I just put a facebook ad up clicked all the interest that applied and ""Sent it"". Well I got a sale or two so I put some gas to the fire, couple more sales... increase the ad spend. Well me and all the youtube wisdom I have gained thought it grand idea to start fiddling with things like age and gender. Now mind you I only have to ad sets running with broad general interest and 6 countries.

Well I go out one night and forget I got the gas peddle all the way down, 350$ you know I just adjust it as needed. I wake up the next am 600$ boom ads. It made a couple of sales but nothing notable, I put the axe in the product shut her down and looked for the next. 

Third lesson, Advertising in the niche is not always the winner. I found my next product and this time set out to learn all about facebook ads. Listening to all the filler in most youtube guru videos is mind numbing, they could teach what they are doing in 5-10 mins but its a 1 hour long video about how they scaled from $.25 to 500,000,000. Now that I got a way better understanding I get 20 ad sets with 2 different video for each ad sets @ 20 dollar spend limits. While doing all this I say what the heck, I run 10 new ad sets for the ""Failed"" product.

Well the new product flops pretty freaking hard, but the old product starts making decent sales. Today 7 sales for $175.\*\* the ads ramping up nice today I seen them in learning mode. So I looked it up said they would optimize better after that and the results will be kinda hit and miss and I see that. Some spurts of traffic will have sales and other won't. It might be weird but I stare at the dots on the live view ""mwhaha""I am watching you!

Fourth Lesson, you need to work on ads everyday. I am finding new data everyday I can use to target new groups to increase sales. My goal is to run 5 new ad set every day to keep fresh clicks flowing.

I'm on my way starting my first dropshipping store ever, but i'm the kind of guy doing a lot of thinking before acting, this way i avoid (or try to) a lot of mistakes.

I binged many dozens hours of YouTube videos and, now, taking the pros and the cons, i think i'm on my way to launch it pretty soon.

Now, i have a question for you guys, i've seen a lot of people claiming that margins should be 2.5 or 3x not less, and be at least 10$ profit.

The item i'm planning to DS is a low budget one, costs 3.5$ and i'm planning to set the price around 6-7$, which makes it around 2x margin.

So, to break even i would need to sell at least a dozen of these to pay for Shopify + Domain fees, not talking about advertising, not sure yet to use Facebook ads or Instagram influencers, i think IG fits more my audience.

How about you guys, on low prices items, what are your margins ?

ecommerce,How shipping works?,"I'm completely new to shipping and am planning on using either FedEx or Ups for shipping, because they are the only one close to me. However I have no idea how it works.
1. Do you get the wrapper from them before hand or are you supposed to package it at the handlers? 
2. Do you get insurance from the handler ? Do you need it?
3. How can I make sure that my costume can resend the item without them paying for it?
4. How can I make sure the costumer doesn't have to pay for tax or shipping when the package arrive?
5. Where do you get the form to label the package 
6. Do you ship all the items at once

* the item is a lightweight t-shirt 

* I know that you can get a label machine to stick on the costumers location. However I don't know where you get the form from.

shopify,"Selling shirts should not be this hard, how can I make this easier?","So I've got Printful integrated into my shopify story. Works great. I designed a shirt, made it available in 3 different colors on my site. It went great. Made lots of sales. But then, I got a woman ask for it to be in women's cut. Well there are tons of women's cuts. So I added the shirt in women's baggy and women's slim fit. Then I got requests to make the shirt available in a tank top. Ok ok. So now it's a tank top too. Whew. All's good.

But now, I have a dozen shirts on my store. So I have to apply this to all my shirts. And when I go make a new shirt, I have to add 4 shirts to the store.

The experience would be much better for me and my customers if you: 1 - pick the design, 2 - pick the color, 3 - pick the shirt style Mens/Womens, 4 - pick the size. But as it is my customers are a bit overwhelmed with multiple shirts that look the same in the store but are just different cuts.

dropship,Drop shipping Diary: Day 3,"Day 3 is coming to a conclusion. Nothing miraculous has happened, I've mainly just been sending out emails, and learning how to edit images(for my logo). I haven't acquired any new affiliates today which is very disappointing. That makes 2 days dry, and so now i must rethink my approach. I was thinking about making a multi account so I could go harder on DMing influencers to get affiliates; but I don't really thing that would go too well. I'm pretty clueless on how to get more affiliates right now, I even offer a sign up bonus but that still hasn't helped much. I want to chulk it up to just improving my landing page Logo, but there has to be more to it. I've also uploaded 2 pictures to my Instagram in hopes of acquiring more followers. I think my low follower count gives a bad impression. If i had the money, i would buy a couple thousand followers to look more legit. Overall, today has been a big disappointment with a big sting hitting my morale. I can't quit quite yet; I feel like if i keep muscling through it I will find some success. I'm having some people respond to my messages but they aren't grabbing the hook so I really do have hope.

edit: I actually got 1 more affiliate

dropship,Just looking for any advice on whether or not I have a winning product,"I decided to start an ecom store about 2 weeks ago and have put together a super basic website. I really just wanted to test if people were going to be interested in my products.

So far I only have 6 products with some loox reviews. After looking at other posts I definitely need to improve my website by adding FAQ, better landing pages, and better copy. 

As for advertising, I've been using Facebook ads. I have done testing here and there and have an ad that has a cpc of .28$. So far there have been 5 items added to cart and 2 initiated checkouts but no sales:/ I have reached roughly 200 page visits. 

As for the ad I'm currently running the traffic directly to the product. I'm starting to consider that might not be the best idea. However, I want people to be directed to what they are being advertised. 

Should I run people to a landing page over a specific product?

Do I have a viable product based on what my results? 

Should I add more products?

Would it be worth my money to invest in a paid theme and a professional logo?

dropship,What are the dropshipping and wholesale websites in China?,"In recent years, with the popularity of the Internet and the development of cross-border e-commerce, many sellers will cooperate with a cross-border e-commerce platform in order to obtain better delivery channels and resources. This also shows that it is very important to find a suitable and professional platform.

Now let's take a look at some of the best cross-border e-commerce platforms in China.

**1, AliExpress**

AliExpress is one of China's largest cross-border export B2C platforms and one of the most well-known websites. Covering 30 primary industry categories such as 3C, clothing, home, and accessories. The logistics service is mainly based on postal size package, AliExpress cooperation logistics and commercial express delivery. It should be noted that the website owner does not provide a service for himself. Instead, it is a supplier or manufacturer registered as an AliExpress member, responsible for processing a one-off order.

**2，Quarkscm**

Quarkscm is an export distribution platform created by Tongtuo Technology, a leading cross-border e-commerce company in China. The platform currently has more than 300,000 SKUS, 12 categories, offering even up to 20% product discount rates. There are 7 overseas warehouses in the world, which greatly improves the delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction. The platform supports docking shopify, amzaon, joom, lazada, shopee, mercadolibre, oberlo and other online logistics.

In addition to providing quality products for cross-border e-commerce companies, Quark regularly conducts training on distribution business process services for applicants and provides personalized cross-border transaction solutions.

**3.** **ChinaBrands**

ChinaBrands is also a very good supplier with product prices covering low-end to high-end product lines.The product classification is very comprehensive, including cheap clothes, bags, shoes, jewelry and accessories, beauty, 3C products, household necessities, etc.With 300,000+ online SKUs, the logistics channel covers more than 200 countries and regions, and has overseas warehouses in 12 countries around the world.

dropship,I've finally had a breakthrough - £110k in 25 days,"So I'm an 18 y/o from the UK &amp; I've been dropshipping for a little over a year now and until October, I had probably made £10k in sales, if that (with little to no profit).

I've never been close to giving up because I knew I'd get this far but it has been a fucking grind. I've put in countless hours, late nights &amp; sacrificed my college grades for this. Anyway, I've generated £110,000 in sales in the past 25 days. I'm definitely not writing this post to boast, but more for people who are like me, out there, currently struggling with getting that initial breakthrough.

I started with roughly £150. It really can work out with a small budget, I'll admit that it isn't advised but yes, you can get where you want to be from a small budget, if you put in the work.  I had always struggled with finding winning products, I must have tested around 30 with no success but it's true, once you hit your first winner, it pays off all of the losses from the losing products. When it comes to product research, do not overthink it. This is my first winner but the day I stopped overthinking and wondering whether things were too ""saturated"", I found my current winner. 

I've never purchased a course, I have explored a few that have been sent to me for free but they're nothing you can't find on Youtube.  Youtube is your best friend.

Anyway, if you're struggling, just know if you're willing to put in the work, you'll be looking back on the days of struggle like I am now and laughing because every single second of hard work has been worth it.

shopify,Talk to your customers and make them part of the brand / experience. Don't be a faceless brand.,"Hey all,

Wanted to drop in and talk about something that most people ignore. So before launching my commerce store, I was working on a startup with a couple of friends. Long story short, we got an interview at Y Combinator, one of the biggest tech startup accelerators in the world - companies like Stripe, AirBnB, Coinbase, InstaCart etc. came from that accelerator.

During the interview the partners got stumped on 1 question: How do you know that people want what you're making? Have you talked to your users?

We didn't talk to anyone. We were building the startup in a bubble with no real communication with what our end users actually wanted. When we talked to them, we realized that there were other solutions that were more technically advanced than ours. That hurt, but it was a huge reality check and I'm thankful we found out before we funnelled in a lot of money and time.

Anyways, I eventually decided that I didn't want to be part of the startup anymore mainly because I wasn't really interested in the topic, I kind of went into the field because I thought it'd be a money maker. Instead, I thought about going back to ecommerce. I had some initial success with it before the startup and figured, hey what the heck, may as well go back.

This time, Im taking YC's advice to heart and I've spent some money building an email list + social media following for my brand prelaunch. I spent a couple hundred and I have an email list of &gt;1000 people. My product has variations - colour, style etc. so instead of shooting in the dark and hoping they like my product, I sent out an email blast introducing myself in a simple text email. I said who I was, what I want to build the company to be, and why I'm doing what I'm doing. I kind of felt like I may be annoying, but the response was actually surprising. They were an open book, sent me photos of similar products and explained why they don't like it, what they wished was improved and what styles / colors they wanted.

Now, I have a blueprint before making a large order with my manufacturer, and it's honestly reassuring. I'm going to keep engaging with them and talking with them to make sure that what I make is something they truly want, and I think thats some invaluable insight. With them engaged and involved in the process, they feel like they're actually part of the brand rather than just an end consumer. This could even lead to an awesome kickstarter!

So try it! You might be surprised at what response you get. Whether its email, social media, surveys, reviews - you should treat them like people and not as just a means to get some money. Surprisingly, taking this approach will actually help you improve. Paul Graham, one of the founders of YC, bases the entire accelerator around this ethos. Make something that people want, and the only way you can know what they want is by engaging with them.",11,21,2019-11-21,ECOM,0.04073665291070938,0.9236272573471069,0.035636045038700104

ecommerce,How can I ship all the products on a Multi-vendor platform?,"Let me explain the situation here.

I started a multi-vendor platform using Woocommerce and Dokan.
Even though the sellers are setting their stores and adding their products, I want to be responsible for shipping all items to control the quality and make sure the product arrives at the destination.
Also, since everything comes from the same country and buyers will probably buy products from different stores, I don't want each store to charge the buyers for shipping when in the end, all the products will be shipped from the same country...

shopify,First shopify month done (4842$ Revenue) .. payout &amp; accounting questions!,"Hey Guys,

I had a very exciting month, with a lot of sales .. I’ve generated a revenue of more than 4842$!
I’m so excited about this, that I started my administration and accounting with a smile. Imagine!

Imagine how fast my smile disappeared? Yes, as soon as I started to calculate the Taxes and Shopify/Paypall fees. I’m loosing around 1/4th of what I earned, shame!

However, this post isn’t meant to complain .. rather to ask some questions! Currently I’m exporting my Shopify orders into an excel, match every order with my PayPal record to see how much my PayPal fees where.  Same with Shopify. (Amount paid - Paypal amount received = fees, right?)

However, this took me a few hours to calculate .. and I can imagine there is a faster way to do this?

So, my questions:

* Can I generate &amp; download a monthly shopify invoice with all the fees they took from me?
* Can I generate &amp; download a monthly PayPal invoice with all the fees they took from me?
* Can I generate &amp; download a monthly all the outgoing shopify invoices / receipts to customers?

ecommerce,Testing and validating product ideas,"How do you rapid prototype or smoke test and validate business ideas? 

A common suggestion/strategy (and what i have used to test 3 unsuccessful ideas) for starting a business is to create landing pages to test product market fit and the demand for the product.  This makes sense to me with a development background because it lends itself to agile and lean approaches. But I’m finding it harder to believe that a simple landing page with maybe 500 words describing the product drives any conversions like it is suggested by many successful people or businesses.  You hear this advice from folks like Tim Ferriss, Noah kagen and is frequently mentioned on many of the most popular ecom podcast.  

I don’t doubt these people had success with these landing page smoke test but I find it difficult to create a simple landing page and drive air traffic to it without looking scammy. Sure my product could just be crap that no one wants or my copy isn’t driving conversions.  But I’m curious if others here use a different approach to testing and validating ideas or can share thoughts on this approach of using ad traffic to landing pages to test.

if request, i can share a link to a idea I’m currently working on.  This site has taken about 20 hours to make and I dont think that is considered a quick smoke test.  My fear is that I need to test at least 5 more ideas until i find a successful product, which would mean at least 100+ hours of just creating the smoke test.  

Thoughts, suggestions or strategies would be greatly appreciated. Happy Friday!",3,15,2019-11-22,ECOM,0.026373354718089104,0.9319431185722351,0.04168352484703064

shopify,Honest opinion about dropshipping biz model,"Do you think dropshipping is a fad that is dying out or is it an emerging trend that will still be around for five years?  
I become skeptical about business models whenever I begin to see a lot of YouTube videos or blog articles talking about how easy and quick it is to make money do a *thing*. It seems like drop shipping is the popular topic now, much like amazon FBA was a year or so ago. 

I ask because I’m looking to invest my personal time over the next 6 months into learning more and gaining experience in e-commerce.  I’m not looking for a get rich quick scheme because I don’t believe those exist. Rather I’m curious if the community thinks that pursuing drop shipping businesses would be a good way to invest my time and build skills that will be valuable for the next few years.

dropship,I would love some feedback please,"Okay, I apologize in advance if this turns ranty...I am very frustrated and would love some guidance!

I have started no less than 10 different shopify stores, spent over $600 (I know that's not a lot, but if you knew my finances you would know that's a TON!) on ads etc, spent a bunch more on dropshippers, ebay, etc etc etc, all for not one single sale.

Now you might be thinking, ok, it's your niche...well, I have experimented a bit, the latest I shut down 2 days ago because I am not paying for it until I can figure more things out. The niches I have played with are home decor, fashion (I really know nothing about fashion!) baby store, Wiccan, Dark Magic and some basic general stores. My wiccan facebook page has quite a few followers, but all the products I can source there seem cheap and not quality and honestly, can be found anywhere.

So, okay, must be page design...I have played with this as well...no idea what to change there. It all seems easily workable on mobile...

I think...THINK...one of the problems is that I refuse to work with China shippers. I don't think it is fair or reasonable to expect people to wait 2-3 weeks for what is routinely poor quality products. I am currently trying Doba, but hell, I can find cheaper products (prior to me marking them up!) basically anywhere. I have tried Spocket...okay, it works well enough with Shopify, prices seem...ehhh...ok...but in order for it to be free it would have to be under 25 products. Fine, doable, but I can't figure out what will actually sell!

I have tried IG and Twitter for marketing as well, but everyone says to either pay influencers (I did one time, got views, but no clicks) or to just keep posting content that has nothing to do with your products to gain followers etc etc. THEN start posting products.

I am a delivery driver and a single mother. I am in pain at the end of every day (people do NOT order light things!!! Thanks CHEWY! UGH) and want to leave that line of work. In order to do that, at my age and my station in life, that means I HAVE to work from home. I love people and have no problem with providing excellent customer service, but without customers, how do I do that?

dropship,First $100 Day! INSANE. AMA. Product Reveal,"Many of you may not recognize me from my other posts, as I only post about once a week.  However I started dropshipping with a jewelry store, only to realize how terrible it is to start in that specfic niche.

So I did what any sane person would do.... I put that store on hold and began to try my luck with something else that has been proven.  I chose a very holiday niche item, (one product store with different variants), so no doubt it will die after Christmas, but I have made plans for longevity with marketing and suppliers.  

You all are here for the numbers. *I know you are.* *Yes... you.*  
Let's start with the jewelry store.  I put around $120 into ads and made $68.40 dollars in SALES. not profit. just sales.  So that wasn't nearly break even, just a complete loss.  However, it was as expected because I began running facebook ads before I watched ANY videos/tutorials on it.  I was just so excited to start marketing my product that I hadn't studied ad strategies or any ad copy.

First store ads ran over a time period of 2-3 weeks.

*1-2 weeks pass by*.  I am finally ready to open my next store after dedicating all of my time to intensive research, learning marketing tactics, ad strategies, and all of that fun stuff. I pulled back on spending any ad spend on my 1st store at this point.

I learned a lot about myself and my time management during that period.  A lot of the stuff I thought was super important, turned out to just be wasting my time.  On my first store, I spent so much time testing logos, fonts, themes, and so much pointless stuff.  Meanwhile! On my second store I still don't even have trust badges! Or a logo! (a bit of an exaggeration, but I just grabbed a transparent .png image of the product I sell on Google Images).  However, I spent a lot more time on high ROI work, like ad copy/creatives, editing product pictures, making scroll stoppers, researching my audience, or even joining FB groups of this audience.

After just 3-4 days of advertising with my new strategy, I spent half of what I spent previously, but made $281.73 in sales after just 4 days.  There is obviously much room for scaling and improvement, but it's all a learning process. [https://imgur.com/gallery/i3q37aL](https://imgur.com/gallery/i3q37aL)

After understanding the value of products and competition, I normally wouldn't do a product reveal, but this product is very seasonal and with shipping times, anybody who tried to start a store would most likely get more disputes than sales if their product delivered after Christmas.  So without further ado...

The awaited product reveal...  **Christmas engraved rolling pins**. If you are interested in seeing my store, DM or message me.  I don't want to publicly post the store to inflate my traffic and screw my conversion rate.

Ran into a LOT of snags. You can see multiple spots on the graph where sales just plummeted. Facebook kept suspending my ad account temporarily because my bank kept marking any ad payments as fraudulent.... so every time Facebook tried to charge me, my bank would put it on hold, Facebook would put me on hold, then I'd have to sort it out.

Also, Shopify has also flagged my account for the past 5 days and put any payments on hold while they ""verify"" me. I have all the documents they wanted, but still kinda nervous. Have $1,000+ sitting in Shopify payment hold. Considering lowering ad costs until it's resolved but I guess I have the backup money to keep going (for now).

Daily adspend is currently $220 and it's been there for 2 days. Started off at $10 a day like most and kept increasing it as time went on. Every time I increased it, my ROAS dropped, and then got better as time went on.... so I don't think I'm going to be making any huge jumps anytime soon.

I'm no pro at dropshipping, but also not new ecommerce or web development. I already run a successful store on Amazon and get paid hourly to design other people's stores, so please don't be discouraged if you're on your like, 10th attempt.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I keep making post updates (you can see my previous posts here, but I'm too lazy to go link them). Good luck everyone and happy holidays!

dropship,Overwhelmed getting into Facebook Ads.,"Hi all,

I have a bunch of questions for the near future, but I'll stick with the most pressing for now:

**What is an effective, reliable, and SIMPLE Facebook Ads strategy I can follow to launch my Shopify store, that members here recommend?**

I have perhaps the equivalent of USD$500, one product I'm confident in which is already selling, a unique angle, a Shopify single product store still within the trial period, a .com URL, and in the background I'm working on making a much more professional store with Elementor / Woocommerce, which I'll switch to in the future.

I've been following the advice of Gabriel St. Germain and a few others who say that you need at least $500 to $1000 to really do Facebook Ads successfully. Others talk about really small budget methods. It's getting a little overwhelming trying to figure out how to start out on the right foot.

The approach that seems to make sense to me is to run a cheap PPE campaign (to validate the product, build social proof?), then use the data from that to hone in on targeting. LOTS of opinions around on what to optimize for after that.

I have the $500 to put into this now.. if I'm not successful with that then it'll be a while before I can muster up that kind of cash for something like this again, hence I really don't want to blow it all following the wrong advice.

dropship,4th times a charm?,"Hello everyone, 

I’ll be blunt. I love the idea of drop shipping, but I’m not sure if I’m cut out for it.

I first tried it in December 2018 in the automobile niche and I was following the advice of a YouTube e-commerce “guru” who made it look so easy, but it didn’t go so well. I spent around 10 hours a week on it. I made a couple sales here and there but I ended up losing. I stopped after a month.

I loved the sensation of this e-commerce business and the sales that came in, so I ended up doing it again for February’s Valentines Day 2019. I changed my niche to Women’s health and beauty (I thought it was more profitable) I followed other YouTuber gurus and I seemed to do a little better. I spent around 15 hours a week on it. I made more in sales and my ads seemed to do better but I ended up losing again but less than last time. I stopped after another month.

I wouldn’t quit, so I began again in April 2019 (again in health and beauty) and I also had started an instagram page to compliment my website. I thought I could build a following and produce content that could lead an audience to my website. I dedicated 18 hours a week on it and was doing pretty good for a while, I ended up doing the most in sales than I ever have.  After a while though, I began to “run out of gas” and it felt like homework at one point. 

Wake up, post a post on social media,  check FB ads, watch a video on health and beauty, create a social media post, work on creating a following audience, and then trying to optimize the Shopify website and repeat. This heavy schedule, combined with the fact that I was a guy who had no clue about women’s health and beauty, I lost passion for the work.

Now it’s November 2019, and I’ve explored the stock market, real estate, and other types of business, but I really miss that sensation dropshipping brings, I was wondering whether I should give it another shot, this time, with more diligence and putting more hours into it, and actually picking a niche I have a passion for. 

Anyone else experienced this? Any advice is appreciated! I really want to go for it, but I’m afraid of losing again...

ecommerce,Processor wants me to hire PFI company to do PCI SAQ – Should I get Attorney involved?,"So MasterCard contacted my processor claiming that my website has been identified as a common point of purchase (CPP). Apparently MasterCard is claiming that cardholders buying stuff on my site are now experiencing fraudulent purchases. 

It’s my guess that this happens when your site has malware. I do hire Sucuri and I have a firewall that constantly scans for errors, I also ip block my backend, etc. I’m a bit shocked but not saying it’s impossible.

What concerns me is that it seems like MasterCard has it out for me and is going to find something at all costs. The email basically says, ""after we check, we'll let you know how much we'll fine you"". Not, ""if we will fine you"" but how much. OK...

Should I get my attorney involved or just let them do the full scan. When they present some crazy fine, then my attorney should argue it? The whole thing just seems crazy. I mean who’s to say they didn’t stop somewhere else like a gas station afterwards?

Also how does this differ from Sucuri... is it just a malware scan? Or do they access all areas of the account and cart?

I'm also assuming I'd have to pay this out of pocket? Dos anybody know what this may set me back? I got the email the day before Thanksgiving... fun way to start the holiday.",18,9,2019-11-29,ECOM,0.06974276900291443,0.9072767496109009,0.02298048324882984

shopify,"For Everyone Shutdown by Shopify Payments, Here's Everything You Need to Know","# High Risk Industries

In the Merchant Processing space there's a ton of businesses, products, and industries which are considered ""high risk"". These are deemed high risk for a variety of reasons. Some of these products or services just have higher than average numbers of chargebacks, others are kind of grey market industries, and some there's seemingly no reason besides other processors have deemed them high risk. And lastly, some are just because it puts processors at risk of being drawn into lawsuits, so things like supplements and nutraceuticals. 

There's many high risk businesses which are fairly obvious ie your selling vaping supplies, weed pipes, etc. Many people would never expect something like say hair extensions or fake hair to be high risk, but it is. Shopify Payments and Stripe are both run by Stripe so the TOS, and lists of prohibited services are fairly similar. Up until recently dropshipping was actually listed on Stripe's list of prohibited businesses, but it was recently taken off. If you want to read the lists here is the list of [Shopify prohibited businesses,](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms-payments-us) and here is the list of [Stripe's Prohibited Businesses.](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses).

# What Will Get You Shutdown

One thing to keep in mind is just because your specific business or product isn't listed, doesn't mean they can't  shut you down. They purposely leave the list vague, and it says at the end, they can essentially shut you down for any reason.

Again, some obvious things that will get you shutdown, high number of credit card chargebacks, excessive returns, as well as being in obviously grey area industries like weed pipes, vaping supplies, selling college essays, etc. Anything related to selling cryptocurrency, and not just that sometimes even selling something like Ledger or Trezor wallets, just because they are in the crypto industry and keywords about crypto are on your site you may be shutdown. Anything that violates others intellectual property ie selling movie, tv, video game characters, bands, singers or celebrities merch you don't have the rights to. No you can't sell Backwoods Blunt hoodies if you don't own the rights. No drugs, supplements, or drug paraphanalia. Even adult related products are a 50/50 whether you'll get shutdown. 

# What To Do After Shopify Payments Shuts Me Down?

Many people's first reaction is to run out and start antoher store and setup processing through Shopify payments. It may get flagged right away, you may get away with it for a few weeks but this isn't a longterm strategy.

Some people will try to go through Paypal. Paypal and Stripe have different policies, sometimes Stripe is more lenient, sometimes Paypal is, so you can give Paypal a try. Here's the problem, once you are considered high risk chances of other processors considering you high risk are very high.

Here's another thing that sucks about not using Shopify payments. Even though Shopify won't let you use their payment platform and kicked you off, they are still going to penalize you and charge you an additional 2% for not using their payments so if your taking Paypal or your own merchant processing, your gonna get hit with an additional 2% on top of the 3% or so your processor is charging you. 

# High Risk Merchant Processors

There's certain banks and processors that specialize in working with high risk industries. One thing to be very careful of, in the high risk space there's more scammers than there are legit companies. Two of the only companies I've run across who can be relied upon are [Durango Merchant Services](https://durangomerchantservices.com/) and [Charge](http://www.charge.com/banners/click.php?a=johnn520) . 

Now I know many people here don't have much money and are really bootstrapping. You've been spoiled by Paypal and Stripe, a ""real merchant account"" typically costs money. Your normally looking at about $15 to $30 per month to have the account. Then to hook it up to Shopify you'll need an Authorize.Net account or another gateway, that can run like $6 to $30 a month. The true cost is about $6 but most merchant processors mark it up, so your looking at probably $20 to $40 per month for the merchant account.   

# Wrapping Up

For those of you just starting out, or early on in your business who are just discovering that payment processing is going to be an issue. Industries like this that are regulated or how to operate in can be very lucrative since there's a moat to keep people out. That said it's also goign to be a challenge for you. You'll likely over the years have ongoing issues with payments and if payments are a challenge advertising likely will be too since many mainstream advertising channels don't allow high risk industries either.

If your just starting out, don't have much experience in ecommerce, business, or marketing you may want to consider moving on to an industry that's easier to operate in. If you stick with it again it can be very lucrative, but there's going to be challenges.",9,50,2019-11-30,ECOM,0.07177428342401981,0.8949551284313202,0.03327059093862772

shopify,Shopify App Devs - What tools do you use?,"Hi there,

I have been learning about Shopify app development lately and was wondering what tools other devs are using. I've found that Shopify offers this [CLI Tool](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-cli) and I have been playing with it. Most of my experience as a dev is with Vue and PHP but I've been trying to use Shopify's preferred stack for the benefit of Polaris.

A few things I've encountered so far:

Developing an embedded app requires that I expose my dev env to the internet with NGROK. This works, but I've found it to be really slow with the Next/Koa.js stack included in the CLI tool. Am I alone here? I feel like this is really limiting my productivity.

Polaris offers a nice UI (Drop zone) for handling file uploads but of course this doesn't handle actually uploading the file anywhere. Is there a way that we can access the shop's media library, or do we need to store the files on our own servers somewhere?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",11,24,2019-11-30,ECOM,0.029757685959339142,0.930544376373291,0.039697933942079544

dropship,Common problems and how to fix them,"I made this thread as an open discussion where everyone can discuss problems they ran into and how to fix them so we  nobody has to give a guru money for info that should be free.

Fb business manager got banned. I was using a fake name so I got banned, switched to my real name and it was good for a little until i got banned again for traveling...

Now I'm on my third and so far so good. 

Chargebacks! Never fulfill an order if the billing address, cvv, or zip code does not match the original! Also orders made with paypal say like cvv unavaible, that's normal.

Customers demanding refunds for delayed shipping. Only way to fix this imo is either include the extra cost of fedex shipping or use usa sellers from spocket (free for 14 days [https://spocket.grsm.io/aidanjolly3548](https://spocket.grsm.io/aidanjolly3548)) I do both and so far so good. If you're going to be stubborn, make sure it says the same processing time as it does on aliexpress, so when customers blow up your phone you can show them the shipping policy that clearly states long processing times.

That brings me to the next point. Don't use the default return policy. it's obsolete unless your selling gift cards and dvd's.

Idk if everyone know's this but I realized the ad copy has to be consistent with the product description copy. Like...

""Discover this simple trick anyone can use to fix back pain and improve poster"" for the ad copy then ""The one simple trick to fix back pain and improve posture"" for the landing page copy. This way it makes someone with that problem wanting to read it in hopes of getting an easy fix, then u sell them on fixing their posture or whatever and they're like fuck it! I need this.

Also I didn't use abandoned checkouts emails or sms for like the first month. Looking back it rn, I had 115 reach checkout so that could've been like 20 extra sales for only a little extra money. Abandoned checkout sequences are necessary. I use smsbump (way to expensive, if anyone has a cheaper recommendation that'd be great) and smartrmail (free &amp; easy).

I'm building a brand, I'm not really doing the direct response problem solving products rn. If you're selling products like clothing, jewelry, accessories it's best to order the products first to take pictures for obvious reasons, sales instantly boosted when I used my own photos to stand out (still far from success:/) .Not as necessary with cheap gadgets.
