ecommerce,Competitive Intelligence Tool - Testers Needed,"I've been developing a competitive intelligence tool for e-commerce for a while now and I'm just about ready to start testing. I'm looking for a couple of people who run online stores to help with the testing.

The basic pitch is a tool to allow you to track price, promotion and availability changes of your key sellers across your rival stores. Know the best time to promote a product, take advantage of stock shortages, know when they discount, when things go on special etc.

**What I Need?**

Most of the backend technology is in place and I'm working on the front end at the moment. I'm after people that run online stores to help me test the functionality and suggest features etc. I run a number of stores myself but I'm looking for some external input at the moment. There's no dependence on the store technology at this point and all I need is a product feed and your main competitors to get started.

**What do you get?**

Free access to the tool for as long as you want to use it. Once it goes live it'll be a paid service but I'll wave that for anyone that can help me through this early *alpha* testing.

If you're interested drop me a line here and we can chat some more.",4.0,3,2014-10-01,ECOM,0.023096146062016487,0.9302291870117188,0.04667464271187782

Granted the page will load in under 2-3 seconds once we take it live with gzip and caching I want the user to be able to zoom in and see the metal grain, see the stickers and see any details they want. The 950x650 size seems to be a good size for this when using cloudzoom and lightbox zooming. 

So whats a good standard to go with here? Am I taking it too far or not far enough?

ecommerce,Best open source E-Commerce solution for Epicor ERP,"Hey all!    

I am reaching out to you guys to get some options on some of the best open source e-commerce solutions which I could tailor up to our future ERP system (roughly running in 2 years). 
We currently run Epicor Prophet 21 and went through a specialized company that develops e-commerce for P21 (3rd party). It does the following:    

Current Statements  
Purchase History  
Recent Orders  
Invoices &amp; Shipments  
Open Backorders  
Order Importing  
Stock / Availability  
Custom Pricing based on User (B2B/B2C)  
Custom Product Availability based on User (B2B/B2C)  
Etc.    

Our current site is a site-in-a-can and works, but has little to no customization available - everything must be done through a work order and 90% of the things I'd like to do is impossible for me to accomplish. Obviously when we move to the new system we have to scrap the old as it's licensed to that company - and it won't work with the new system. We also want to get rid of all 3rd parties involved with our website and do (mostly) everything in house or contract it out.    

I have done front-end development for over 9 years and have been doing back-end development for over a year now..    

Our new system is going to be Epicor Solar Eclipse. To go through a 3rd party, site-in-a-can they want to charge us $260k. This is the first rough number they gave us.. and it's laughable, to me at least, for what they're offering. We basically just put a feeler out..  
We know this third party is utilizing an API that's offered by Epicor, we called Epicor direct and to license the API it is roughly ~6k - it does everything we want it to do. I have heard them saying a client had gotten their API working with Magento, which is the direction I kind of want to go.    

I need an open-source e-commerce platform that is fully scalable in every facet for both B2B and B2C. It must be open source. I need 3+ recommendations please so I can research the best options.    

I personally really want to go with Magento. I've heard the good, the bad, and the ugly. Lots of people say it's nightmarish / a headache / etc. This does not phase me. I have a little over a year and a half to work on developing this with me + contractors - I'd say a year though, cause I do other things as well - and we got to keep our current site rolling, etc. Our budget is roughly ~50k-80k (this does not include the magento enterprise fee/cost).    

Is Magento reasonable? Who would you consider a close competitor that could work with what I am asking?",0.0,1,2014-10-02,ECOM,0.029868056997656822,0.9303426742553711,0.03978924825787544

ecommerce,How men and women shop differently and what the eCommerce marketer can do about it,"Are men from Mars? And women from Venus? Probably not! But they do show quite different buying behaviour. Understanding these difference is key to delivering targeted, relevant content that can push shoppers to a purchase.

Retargeting campaigns are a great way to increase conversion. Data indicates that women are more likely to open marketing emails with 14% of the female respondents in a study saying that they do so regularly compared to around 8% of men. So if you are targeting female shoppers email based retargeting is a great idea. 

Men are more likely to buy when browsing around online, with about 33% of the respondents in a study saying they first saw their most recent purchase while shopping online. So if you are targeting male shoppers contextual web advertising is the way to go. Read on to find ideas on how to account for gender based differences in shopping behavior while trying to persuade your shoppers to buy.

I have experience running my own e-commerce store so I know about setting up a store, the basics of SEO, PPC ads, site layout, load times, promotion. 

My main issue is understanding the competition and market size and what kind of analytics I should be looking at. I am aware of google keywords and google trends.

I am confident I can offer a better product and service with some mild innovations that would be interesting.

These are the main questions I am concerned with

- I know SEO is important for organic traffic and conversions but I can also expect to get good revenue out of PPC ads if I do it well? Anyone here built a store mostly on PPC or paid ads rather than SEO? Is it possible to do that?
- I suppose its not hard to say that a better, cheaper product trumps a better SEO plan?

ecommerce,Cross Domain E-commerce Tracking Issue - Google Analytics,"Hi Everybody! 

I have a client who I'm having a bit of an issue with getting Google Analytics set up for them. Mostly because they're running the world's most amazing e-commerce platform.....Yahoo! Stores. 

(And I was naive enough to think I'd never have to deal with stupid e-commerce problems after I quit working at a company that rhymes with Go-pusion. How silly of me.) 

I used the default cross-domain tracking script for Universal Analytics. Traffic is tracking, but e-commerce transitions are not. 

On the client's site, www.domain.com ,before the &lt;/head&gt; tag, the code is set up as the following: 

    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

    ga('create', 'UA-2x8x5x4-y', 'auto', {'allowLinker': true});
    ga('require', 'linker');
    ga('linker:autoLink', ['order.store.yahoo.net'] );
    ga('send', 'pageview');

On the Yahoo Stores order page, https://order.store.yahoo.net, we have the following script installed: 

    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

    ga('create', 'UA-2x8x5x4-y', 'auto', {'allowLinker': true});
    ga('require', 'linker');
    ga('linker:autoLink', ['domain.com'] );
    ga('send', 'pageview');


Is there anything wrong with my code? Am I missing a piece to get e-commerce data? Do I need to use a provider such as [PowerMyAnalytics](http://www.powermyanalytics.com/products_yahoo-merchant-google-analytics.php?utm_campaign=app_listing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=ga_partner_gallery) or is there a way to get Ecommerce tracking for Yahoo Stores without having to go through a third party? 

Any advice would be appreciated!",5.0,2,2014-10-07,ECOM,0.07828766852617264,0.8906891345977783,0.031023243442177773
ecommerce,Flipkart Get's Trolled By Competitors And Customers On Social Media,"The festive season is here and so are the ecommerce players ready with their sales and offers.

Like every year, to woo new customers, our dear ecommerce biggies are making a lot of buzz by offering sales, discounts and a lot more. Flipkart which is running this year’s Diwali sale by the name Big Billion Day today, grabbed a lot of eyeballs even before the sale began.

As claimed by Flipkart, Big Billion Day was here to offer huge discounts and exciting deals on all its seventy categories.

Flipkart’s website said:

Hear ye, Shoppers! October 6th it is! Wherever you are, with whomsoever you are, pause for a minute and mark your calendar for the Big Billion Day, for the very first time ever on your favourite shopping site, Flipkart. With Diwali fast approaching, Flipkart has made shopping for your loved ones a lot easier, with the 6th October Big Billion Day. Let finance take a back seat as we prioritise sentiments over everything else. Share the joy and spread the love!
However it turned out to be a disappointment for many, as social media was abuzz with trolls of #BigBillionDay with various users mocking Flipkart for increasing prices and then giving discounts today, for products being out of stock and various other reasons.

Flipkart claimed to give over 30%-90% discounts on most products. To check out how genuine these deals were, Mission Sharing Knowledge carried out a research using “Compare Hatke” chrome extension from BuyHatke, which helps customers to actually understand how the prices were in the past few days and which indeed helped us understand the other side of story behind the tactics of discounts and sales offered by Flipkart. The comparison shows that prices of products were increased few days before the sale.

shopify,Is Shopify Right for Me?,"Hey guys,

I'm looking at opening up an online comic book store. I've tried finding other shops that sell comics on Shopify, but only turn up results from people selling prints and other merchandise from their own self-made comic books. I'm looking to be more of a comic book store, selling both comic books, and gaming figures. Most of my items are in the $1 to $5 range, although some ""beat up"" comics will be in a $0.25 bin. 

I'm just wondering, before I go through the work of documenting and implementing an inventory of 2,000 books, if anyone can tell me how Shopify treats small stores such as the one I would be running. 

Also, I heard that there is an insane monthly fee for accepting payment from anything other than Paypal. Something to the tune of $35 a month for merchant services?

Basically, I'm trying to make my mind up on using Shopify to open a store, as FeeBay is driving me away, both because of their fees, and the sellers who can seem to undercut me at every turn (seriously, how are people turning profits selling $1 figures for $0.05?).

I'm going to end this rant here with asking for any suggestions on the best way to proceed to use Shopify. Whether to start small on the $30 plan, then move to higher tiers as my inventory allows, or just to open big, and hope for the best.

We have 3.5 employees total (including myself), located on the Midwest, USA.  My company is a reseller of hardware/software mostly geared towards the medical market.  The business basically runs itself at this point and I have been looking to start another e-commerce/online venture. 
 
Here is what I bring to the table…

-      Website Developers
-      Graphic Designers
-      E-Commerce Cart Expertise 
-      PPC Experts
-      SEO Experts
-      E-Commerce &amp; Business Expertise
-      An established physical office that has all the necessary business requirements (business address, awesome phone system, PC’s, printers, fax, etc. – no big deal).  I also have empty space available so it would be easy to expand.
-      Shipping system – we drop ship 80% but ship directly often.  Just depends.
-      Employees – my bookkeeper could use more hours, my tech guy is not as busy as he could be (good thing), my sales guy is hungry and I handle a bit of everything as needed.
Please note most of the above are outsourced.  I have spent plenty of time over the years building solid relationships with these companies/freelancers and have found cost effective solutions with great outcomes.  Most of the 3rd party solution providers I work with are on retainer for my current business and charge next to nothing to do additional work.
 
I am sort of a “jack-of-all trades” with e-commerce but master of none.  I have learned that it is much easier to find others much smarter than myself to take care of specifics properly than to try and do everything myself half-assed.  Outsourcing is the only way to run a successful e-commerce business.  There are far too many pieces and parts to try and master them all.  

I have a passion for starting and growing businesses until they can either run themselves or be sold.  I have a bachelor’s degree in marketing – nothing more.

dropship,Approach to getting started?,"I decided a few days ago to start a dropship business, after reading DropshipRedditor's epic post. I've been researching products for a couple of days, and have looked up a few wholesale dropshippers but haven't made any calls yet. I want to test my first niche/products ASAP and I'm thinking the best way to do that is to just choose a niche (of the ones I've researched), build a quick site on Shopify, call a couple of dropshippers for prices, sign up with one and get started.

I know ultimately I'll want to find the best source in my niche, but I'm looking for the fastest way to do a proof-of-concept for now. I figure if I start getting orders I can do a lot more research at that point and change dropshippers then, but for now I just want to validate and I feel like fully researching the best dropshipper before even knowing if I can drive sales in that niche is putting the cart before the horse. 

I'm good at PPC already (do it for a living), which is how I'll drive traffic, and I already have an LLC I can use to sign up with a dropshipper. 

Is that a good idea or is it important to do more due diligence on the supplier side before launching my first attempt?",4.0,1,2014-10-11,ECOM,0.06287121772766113,0.9087182283401489,0.028410514816641808

ecommerce,Question about using Amazon for customer acquisition,"I've Googled dozens of different things and keep coming up with nothing on the topic. Wanted to ask this question in a forum instead of to Amazon directly because depending on the answer, I don't want a target on my back as a seller. 

Amazon takes a huge cut on sales, as we all know. Ideally, I'd like to use Amazon for customer acquisition, so that people find me on Amazon, but make their second (or possibly even first) purchase directly on my site. I'm sure I'm not the first one to think about this, so I was wondering what's appropriate and what's [""nicht nicht""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LazrAzBP_0I) in terms of this practice. Some examples I can think of (feel free to add):

* Making company name very explicit on product pages hoping customer will Google you
* Putting URL directly on product pages
* Mentioning your URL in customer communication (whether it's directly saying something about the site or just signing off)
* Putting your website on some form of packing slip of the shipped product
* Having your website on the packaging of your product

Just want to know exactly where the line is drawn (I imagine somewhere in the middle of these examples) as if I'm just using Amazon for sales, it's bound to be an extremely unprofitable channel I'm not interested in.

Any light on eBay, etc. if the answer varies would also be appreciated.

woocommerce,Noob question: Can WooCommerce NOT take payment until the order is manually accepted or declined by the Admin / Shop Manager?,"Hi folks! I'm new to WooCommerce and having difficulty finding the answer to this question.

I'd like WooCommerce to handle one simple thing: commission orders. That is, I accept commissions to create something to a customer's specificiation, and I need the ability to decline orders before the customer pays if I cannot accept that commission for whatever reason (poor design brief, etc).

Here's what I hope WooCommerce or a plugin for it can do:

1. Customer submits order but is not yet billed.

2. Admin / Shop Manager checks order to see if it is acceptable.

3. If order is accepted, customer is billed *or* customer's already-provided payment method is processed.

4. If order is declined, no payment is taken, rather than payment refunded.

Is this plausible?

ecommerce,"Startup questions, especially about handling international shipping","Hi folks,


I am slowly putting everything together for a small store, which would sell handmade traditional dresses from local manufacturers in South-East Asia. The focus is on the high quality, the local production and the culture and history behind these dresses. As they need to be tailored to the measurements to the buyer, they will all be unique and therefore be made-to-order and shipped out one unit at a time.


So I have my business idea, I have some manufacturers lined up, but still, some things keep me awake at night:


1. Is there an appropriate ecommerce platform for this? A platform which can implement a request measurements, which I predefine? Of course I would have to build an infosite on how to take those measurements as well.


2. How do I deal with international shipping? My manufacturers, as the number of orders per manufacturer won't be that high, will bring them to a local post office and then send them out. So far so good. But I know that there are tariffs in many countries for importing clothes. How do I (easily?) obtain this information for every possible country, without digging through tons of info for every country? And how do I deal with the tariff registration process?
As the prices of the dresses might go into the 4 figures, this is highly relevant.


3. How do I implement tariffs into my prices/shipping fees? 


4. As I would like to implement a blog as well, might it be best to start the whole website/shop in Wordpress?


Hope you can give me some advice on these topics!",3.0,3,2014-10-13,ECOM,0.019199712201952934,0.9293524026870728,0.05144789442420006

ecommerce,Anyone else super annoyed with Shopify's discount feature?,"Hey guys,

Just have to rant a bit. The Shopify checkout is the same for everyone on Shopify, that's just how it works. That's somewhat ok - I would like to have more control over it, but whatever. 

The REAL problem is that Shopify asks the consumer to put in their billing info before allowing them to put in their discount code. So the customer doesn't know the total cost of their purchase including the coupon or the total dollar discount they're getting, but they're already asked to put in their info as if they're 100% ready to purchase. You have no idea how many people I've lost at checkout (which isn't customizable at all on Shopify). You also have no idea how many times I've been on an ecommerce site and randomly put things in my cart, put in the coupon they were advertising and thought ""not bad..."" so proceeded to the checkout.

Apparently they tested a million things for their checkout process and they've received sooooo many positive responses with this one... But, like, for real?? This just seems so basic. I want to know how much I'm going to pay before I commit to giving my info.

C'mon Shopify.

ecommerce,"If the product’s alive, shoot it!","Ecommerce players have been making the customer experience better over the past few years with the introduction of great on-site search and navigation, crisp well shot product images and,candid and concise product descriptions. So what more could they give customers? The answer is – Videos!

Ecommerce sites have started uploading videos for products that relate to its use or to its features. Sellers have started providing videos on large ecommerce sites like Amazon, and on some other sites, users or product reviewers are uploading videos as well. As a manufacturer or distributor of B2B products, you have the freedom to bridge the gap! Videos go a long way in helping a potential customer see the value of a product through more than just a description. Here are some other ways that videos help customers:

•	Videos show the product as it actually is, the customer gets to view product’s actual size or color
•	Handling the product is demonstrated which makes it simpler for the customer to operate it themselves
•	Major features are shown at work, which gives the customer the confidence that it will deliver what is promised
•	Your knowledge and skill in handling the product is bound to impress the customer and hence helps build brand image

So what should videos on your ecommerce site be like? Here are some guidelines to follow when creating product videos:

•	Short – Learning about the product is interesting to your customer, but during their work day your customers can’t spare an hour for a long video. Limit the video to a maximum of five minutes. If you want to explain a lot of things, make more than one video. Have each video cover a set of features that are likely to be used together, that way the customer can watch each one when they have time.
•	Sweet – What the product can do? Make sure your video covers the major features and functions. Don’t forget to cover the USP in detail. Throwing in a couple of minor features that may come in handy is also a good way to go.
•	Succulent – The video content has to be juicy! A dreary video listing out the features with a model pointing at the product is not going to impress people who have to shoulder a company’s needs. Show an employee who knows what’s what handling the product like a pro. Have the presenter make a joke or two to keep thing interesting, but don’t let that be the highlight of the video – that spot’s reserved for the product.

By making the product the star of a video, you can make sure it gets the attention it deserves.There are quite a few organizations that also upload their videos to YouTube and Vimeo;so look to those for inspiration. Whether you would like the videos to be produced in house or through an external agency is a call you’ll have to make depending on the resources at hand, either way you need to make sure that the videos are have great audio, visual and content quality.

ecommerce,I might be over-thinking this. Am I trying too hard?,"For starters, my background is in systems management/administration so I'm not scared off by doing things on the backend.  I've been making various things(graphic tees, household cleansers, kind of whatever strikes my fancy) for myself and people I know personally and the feedback has been good enough that I'm encouraged to start selling them online.

I got a VM from a hosting company, did all the systems lockdown stuff and installed Drupal.  Drupal itself works without any content.  That's when I realized I might not being using the right tool for the job.

Most of my products will have options such as size, +/- ingredients and it looks like in Drupal I need to create an individual page for each option and then link all of those together in order to display a product with dropdown options to the browser.  That looks like a lot of work to get one product up on the website.

Is there a better way that doesn't involve paying Shopify or Volution, Bigcommerce, or someone like that?  I don't have much of a budget(the VM is free), most of the things I make/sell are done in a JIT fashion so overhead is already low.

ecommerce,Deck your e-stores with some candy!,"Consumers look forward to the holiday season with a lot of anticipation as this season spells big and good deals. As someone who is trying to get the maximum bang for the buck, this is a blessing. For many stores, online or otherwise, this is definitely the time to build customer loyalty.

There is an important step prior to this, and that is getting your business ready to handle the spike in customer interest, sales and support. While most organizations do take steps to prepare for this season, not all of them entirely do what needs to be done. Sites go down, prices aren’t consistent, deliveries are slipped up, and things in general don’t go the way it should. Potential customers are no longer interested and loyal customers are forced to change their favorable opinion of your company. It’s never pretty.

So we decided to have a look at what an ecommerce store would need to do to minimize the chances of having a holiday fiasco. Here are some things that should help prepare for what should be the most wonderful time of the year:

Hanging the e-store mistletoe: Your customers are ready for the sales, but what about your store? Many a vendor has been gung-ho about the holiday season, and then faced the perils of poor planning. So here’s what you should do:
Facelift: A staple requirement, and probably one of the simplest ones, is giving your site a makeover. If you have a B2C business, this step means you make things flashy; but if you’re a B2B business, a subtle approach with some minimal decorations in your sidebar and header would be a better approach. Maybe throw in a couple of banners or sliders that announce different sales for good measure.
Maintenance: While regularly checking your site and products for missing information is routine, it’s important that a more thorough check is conducted before this season arrives. This includes load and volume testing of your servers.
Weightlifting: A very important aspect of getting your e-store ready is making sure you are well connected to the internet, and that your servers can handle any surge in traffic you’re expecting and more.It’s happened to countless vendors that they prepare for 5 times the traffic and get 7 times the traffic. The internet bandwidth they were sure of earlier slows to a crawl; the extra servers they had ready are overwhelmed and become unresponsive or crash.
Decorating the physical store: Your physical stores, if any, need to be prepared for a surge of customers to come in and try out the products. Make sure they are well stocked and have clear directions to where each product can be found. Also, the availability of a product, its variation, etc. on your ecommerce site, so that customers can immediately place large orders, or find something that you don’t have a physical store. Here it’s also important that inventory across your offline stores be synced with your online store, so that customers can’t order a product you just ran out of.
During this season, neither the customer nor you want them to stay for longer than required. This season is about making quick decisions and getting what you need; don’t let it become the hunt for ‘red staplers not blue’.

Getting your sleighs and elves in shape: While you get the online and offline stores in shape, there’s still the delivery to consider. If you offer one-day deliveries, you’re in for a rush.If you deal with an agency to handle your deliveries, make sure you get them prepared for the increase in work.Any delivery vehicles in your control should be prepared for the weather, especially if you’re in for snowfall. The weather is not your friend in most cases, and as such prepare for damage control. Get your support staff ready to handle a greater number of calls and complaints about late deliveries.
The holiday season is the time for the best sales and customer relationships; be well prepared and make the best of it.

ecommerce,My first ecommerce! Historia Posters: High quality posters of antique and historical maps. Feed back please!,"Hi everybody! long time lurker first time poster here! 
My first ecommerce store is:
Historia Posters www.historiaposters.com

I sell high quality posters of fascinating antique and historical maps ranging from world maps in the 1300s to maps of Philadelphia at the peak of the Revolutionary War. These posters are beautiful in aesthetics and very attention catching. They make for a great conversation or atleast a conversation starter and will add a ton of class to any room.

I started this store because I am a history freak and I think posters nowadays are either boring or cringe worthy. But mostly, I just really really wanted one of these and I wanted it out there and easy to get for any others who might want them too.

I've been working on this store for about 2 months now so I have alot to learn.

ecommerce,Lets do some Ecommerce math!,"Hey Everyone,

I thought it would be valuable as I do some ecommerce research to talk about the math.  Sort of like building a business backwards from the numbers.  I am not an expert at all...so this could be a fun exercise with everyones input. 

--

* Let's say I want to make $5000.00 net profit per month. (my goal)

* Lets say my profit margin on each widget averages $5.00 per unit.

* Lets say I sell each widget for $10.00

* If we assume the 1-2% conversion for visitors to your site Vrs sales (lets use 1%)

**Therefore:
**
I need 100,000 monthly visitors to my site ( 1% of 100,000=1000 conversions )

That's 1000 sales.

1000X $10.00 gross price = $10,000 gross sales.

Net = $5,000.00 

---

* Am I crazy?  Is this a good way of evaluating a business idea from a traffic vrs sales perspective?

* This can also be used to make business plans.  For example, I know I need to draw XYZ amount of traffic to be successful or hit my targets.

* Does anyone else have any calculations they would like to share?  Thoughts on my process?

**EDIT**:  Many people have chimed in and have replied to me with super positive stuff.  However, does anyone else want to share their Ecommerce math that helps them:

* Estimate traffic
* Evaluate a niche
* Evaluate competition

ecommerce,simple explanation on AdWords bid strategies?,"I'm not sure how to put this succinctly so my best shot at a TL;DR is:  Do you set your bids at a percentage of your profit margin per item?

If that doesn't make sense, here's the long version:
I have a variety of items on my webstore ranging from a profit of $3.00 (soaps) to $150.00 (guitars).  So I didn't change the original ""max bid"" settings when I set everything up, and I looked yesterday afternoon and found that I had paid $2.00 for a click on a $3.00 profit item!  This seems like a loosing game to me.  So I went back and changed my max bid on each ad/item to be a percentage of the profit for each item.  

So if the ad is for the soaps ($3.00 profit item), my max bid is $.75 but if the ad is for a guitar ($150.00 profit item) I set my max bid at $5.00 

I also tried to use keywords that would be typed if the person is looking to directly purchase one of the items in my store and tried to avoid the more general ones.  As most of my products are hand made I included the negative key words of ""tutorial"" and ""how to make"" 

Am I doing this right?  Any thoughts or suggestions on other ways to improve my conversion rate?

The themes I've managed to find are great, if you're selling a small variety of items. I can't turn up any information about people running large ""one of a kind"" item shops using Shopify, and it's starting to freak me out.

ecommerce,Great post on Shopify's Blog– Referral Marketing 101: 7 Tactics to Launch Your Own Referral Campaign,"A thorough post by Richard Lazazzera for Shopify.

3 reasons why referral marketing works:

* Precise targeting – people mostly make referrals primarily to friends who'll actually be interested in the product.
* Trust factor – people trust their friends and peers more than any other source of information about products. (Nielsen did a study about this.)
* Individual consumers can reach far more people than before.

Examples cited:

* Dollar Shave Club
*  Harry's

How to do referral marketing well:

* Great customer service + buying experience (so people genuinely have a good reason to refer their friends)
* Pay attention to your analytics to see who's already referring customers to you
* Make your product and product experience shareable (this is one of the most fundamental things all growth hackers are expected to figure out!)
* Make it easy for customers and visitors to refer your brand
Implement a referral program (vendors listed: ReferralCandy, Friendbuy, LoyaltyLion, S Loyalty: Refer-a-Friend, Ambassador, Forewards, Referrify)
* Capitalize on influencers. Reach out to popular bloggers and social media influencers in your niche and see if they're receptive to mutually beneficial partnerships.
* Reviews are referrals too, so encourage customers to leave reviews.

ecommerce,Transition from Drop shipper to retailer. Good idea?,"Hi,

I started a drop shipping store about 1 year ago and got an average of 70k in sales the first 8-9 months. I wanted to grow a little bit more and make more profit without changing my prices.

I checked Amazon Fulfilment service and if I use them instead of my supplier, I can double (even a little more) my profit on each sale. This would involve an investment of 4-5k USD which I can recover after 2 months or less. Also by centralizing my products, I was thinking of adding new accessories to my product by ordering them from Alibaba. 

On paper, everything makes sense but I never had any real experience in that matter so I am not sure if there is something that I didn't think of. This shipping price will be shipper, I will have a bigger discount and I can integrate my Amazon account to my Shopify website.

My website is now well ranked on Google (1st-3rd) place on my keywords. Since it is a niche market, it was easy to get better ranking than Costco, Amazon and my own supplier.

Besides a better margin, my main goal is to increase the quality of my service. Since my supplier is not even 1 year old, it is a pain sometimes to deal with them so I want to not have to contact them as often as I currently do. This sometimes makes me look unprofessional when I can’t even get back to my customer when I am waiting for a reply. Also, Amazon provides a same day shipping which will be really good for business in my opinion.

Is there something that I should consider before trying to change my business model?",2.0,2,2014-10-22,ECOM,0.020291665568947792,0.908876359462738,0.07083199173212051

I volunteer in an NPO for Africa for which I have created a wordpress corporate website. Well actually the word would be ""configured"" becuase I have use a third party theme and plugins. So as you will see I´m not a pro.

The problem now is that I´m trying to implement the TPV RedSys Sermepa Payment System so we can receive donations through credit cards in an easy and secure way.

Here is the thing, our bank won´t give us any help to implement the payment method and I was hoping somebody could give me some help.

So I want to create a short of widget with the following fields:

Name: donator´s name

Donation: quantity

Reason: an optional field.

Donate! (a bottom)

So after filling the details, when they click on Donate!, they will be redirected to the Redsys gateway and they only have to fill in the credit card details to finish the donation.

It would be also great, if I could have a piece of code with those fields I can put in diferent parts of the website.

ecommerce,[USA] Free return shipping strategies,"Hi there,

I'm using ShipStation with Stamps.com and USPS FirstClass Package for all my product shipping needs.

I'd like to include a return shipping label with every package I send. There are a few things I'm stuck on.

1) It seems Endicia has a pay-on-use return label system, but ShipStation doesn't appear to support Endicia anymore.

2) I can print a return label with every package through Stamps.com, but I end up paying the full price of the label right up front. I have no idea how I can get this money back, as sorting this out through hundreds of orders by requesting postage refunds seems insane. (That and the money will float for a month or more.)

3) ShipStation has a Newgistics integration and I guess one of their main selling points is handling returns, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how their stuff actually works. They just have marketing driven videos to sell their service, no really concrete examples of workflow.

ecommerce,"Two platform options, seeking your input","Hey all, I'm putting together a page for a new product set I'm launching.  I'm branching out of my service only business, and into the product based, so this is a big learning experience for me.  This falls along the lines of the subscription box model that's been very popular, so I hope to learn a lot through this avenue.  The packing/shipping piece will be done from home, going to add in the fulfillment company variable later.

I'm looking at using Paywhirl for handling the recurring subscriptions.  It appears to have great integration with both wordpress and shopify.  Here is the situation on both.

Wordpress is a great system, that I can find a free/paid theme for.  Some are ecommerce centered, so they likely have back end systems for managing it as a business page.  Though support will be limited.  I already own hosting, so the only upfront cost is the theme.

Shopify costs $15 for basic hosting a month, which has a more limited theme support, but instant paywhirl integration.  Easy theme support, almost instant setup of a web page, and full back end of tools.  Though I don't know/understand their value yet.

What I can't find are compelling arguments to go in either direction.  Is there a reason why using a service like Shopify would be beneficial? easier customer management, back end analytics tools, or shipment integration when I start using a fulfillment company?

ecommerce,Anyone using Shopify + Xero?,"Right now we're currently running Bigcommerce + Xero, and we use Paypal Payments Pro as our payments processor.  Everything is streamlined, and we love it-- Xero handles Paypal as a separate bank account, so all the fees are captured automatically and there is absolutely no manual bookkeeping for sales that happen on our website.

The problem is, we're starting to get fed up with Bigcommerce.  It's not as simple to update and tweak as Shopify is.  Problem is, Shopify sort of forces you to use their payment processor, unless you want to pay a 2% processing fee.  

If we were to switch to Shopify, our options would be to stick with Paypal Payments Pro as our processor and just eat the 2% fee, or use a 3rd party integration to connect Shopify and Xero so that somehow we don't have to do any manual bookkeeping.

ecommerce,Tips for my new ecommerce site? Good or terrible idea?,"I have had a few ecommerce sites in the past, all of which failed due to not having enough time or this thing or the other. I have a new idea which I am going to test out as soon as I get a little bit of capital, (paying a web developer to make my site, buying a few pieces of inventory, and paying a photographer) and to me it seems like a good idea, but it is so different than what I've done before that I just can't tell. I'm going to do it anyway because I'll have fun doing it, but are there things that you think might make it better? Or that I should tweak and change? Okay, so here's the deal. I just moved to a new city and have started doing some modeling (I'm a pretty young, attractive female) my favorite type of modeling is lingerie and bikinis. I had the idea, why don't I just have my own website and sell my own things, since I am capable, have the business sense, and am just modeling for people who are doing the same thing now but making more money running their business (they must be since they are the ones paying me just to model their clothing.) So I was thinking I could have my own website where I sell body jewelry, risque clothing, bathing suits, and lingerie, but it is all my style (pin-up, vintage, high-end type) and I am the one modeling and endorsing it, in a sense branding myself. I also have some connections with celebrities, and could even try and get the name out there that way. I was also thinking maybe I could make it sort of an experience type of business, so the website would be super awesome and experience-based, and also when things are shipped they come in a custom box with a complementary - I don't know, poster of me modeling the product? t-shirt? letter? What do you think? Also, every product picture would be extravagant, and I would want a poster available for every product, so if you don't want the product you can buy a poster of the photo. So is there anything you think I should change or some tips you could give me? Where can I find some wholesale clothing/ body jewelry, and how could I go about designing my own if that's the route I chose? Thank you in advance for the help!

dropship,Looking for Equity Marketing Partner for Existing Dropship Site,"Hi,

I own a U.S. based drop shipping web site that sells adult toys.  We put a lot of time and money into building a high end web site and establishing a relationship with a drop shipper.  We established an LLC and have a full time copywriter who works on the site.  We followed best practices for SEO and over the past couple of years have expended a lot of effort and money on this web site.

This web site is failing and it's costing me money.  We're getting minimal traffic and have had one order (which was nice since it actually proved that we didn't have to do anything at all to fulfill the order.)  The web site is completely integrated into our Dropship partner and we pull inventory daily and in real time push out orders which they fulfill.  The solution works but the marketing we've done has been completely ineffective.

I have two other businesses that are successful, I have lost confidence in our SEO persons ability to deliver results for this site and I frankly just don't want to keep putting effort into something that isn't yielding results.

With that said, the system is built, the site looks great and we really feel that if we had better SEO or SEM for the site that it could be pretty profitable.  So I'm hesitant to just shut it off or sell it on flippa.  I'd like to ideally find a partner who wants to handle the marketing in exchange for a significant equity stake in the business.

ecommerce,Selling my dropshipping site on Flippa. Auction closing in a few hours,"My auction is up soon. Check it out: https://flippa.com/3284887-pr-2-site-with-1-234-uniques-mo-making-176-mo

I wrote down a background story of how I built the site. It's best to read it on my [blog to get all the image and links](http://nicksid.com/how-i-built-a-profitable-dropshipping-website-from-scratch/), but here's a straight copy and paste to follow the subreddit's rules.

**---------------------------------------------------------------**

Around April 2011 I wanted to build a dropshipping website to make some passive income. Most people build something and then get zero traffic because their site is not addressing real pain points people have. I knew that if I were to build a site as someone with no industry contact, no physical store, heck no office at all, I’d have to do something unique. I had to figure out what product to sell and what would be my Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Now let me tell you a bit about me. I’m a slacker, a computer enthusiast, and a Canadian. One thing that sucks for canadians is buying things online. Shipping is always expensive and slow. Many american sites refuse to sell to canadians, or they bungle the border crossing papers leaving you with a big customs bill to pay to UPS or Fedex. This is major pain point that affects almost all physical products being sold online.

The Market insight: Canadians love free shipping

Ok so the obvious conclusion is that Canadians (pop: 35 millions) are always going to be prefer to buy from the site that clearly states that it offers Free fast shipping in Canada!. There is room for a small player to get this market In any niche where there is no one pitching this angle,

 

The product: Trailer hitches

A friend of mine in Montreal had to buy a trailer hitch for his Subaru Forester to tow his new fishing boat. He bought it online from a Texas based seller on ebay at very good price. It was delivered for FREE the next day. That’s normal in the continental USA, but it is surprising in Canada. He showed me the shipping paperwork. The hitch had come from some address in a Toronto suburb. I googled the exact address and I found out that it was a warehouse belonging to the hitch manufacturer. Bingo! This manufacturer (Curt MFG) clearly had a dropshipping program and was accepting ebay sellers. More than that, they are giving them good enough prices to beat the local brick and mortar competition. I figured I could get on this gravy train: I’d make a drop shipping website for trailer hitches that exclusively target the canadian market. The manufacturer dropships the product quickly from a canadian warehouse.

This looked like an ideal dropshipping product. Priced between $100 and $200 it allows for decent profit per sale ($30 to $60).  However the price is not too high that it causes customers to need to speak to a real person. Shipping is handled by the manufacturer so it’s a non issue.   The product is standardized and the brand is well known. This eliminate any doubt on product quality that buyers could have. Local retailer like to sell at a hefty markup. Basically you need buy online if you want a good price.

Clearly defining the USP

The Unique Selling Proposition was: Free shipping in Canada, no surprise. So I quickly built a quick and dirty website  (More on that later) with a huger header that said “FREE SHIPPING CANADA-WIDE!”. I registered a .ca domain name instead of a .com.

 

Getting traffic: Adwords and SEO

When you are starting off with a brand new domain you get zero love from Google. You will not get any traffic whatsoever. Also you can forget about social media if your selling a boring product. No one is going to share with their friend a picture of a cool looking trailer hitch! This leaves us to pay for traffic.

Google adword’s program is usually the best source of converting traffic. It makes sense since most people are going to do a google search before buying something online. Sadly everyone knows this. This means that your bigger and richer competitors are going to  outbid you to get the top spot ads. As a small guy with no sales volume it’s incredibly hard to convert adwords traffic well enough to compensate for what your spending on this traffic. The big guys have volume that give them lower cost at their supplier, lower shipping cost, better sites that inspire more trust, etc.

The secret to convert Adwords traffic

The secret to convert Adwords traffic is to get a very relevant ads to the right people for the right queries. Ideally it’s even better if you are the only one doing this. My adwords strategy consisted of making very specific ads plus my USP and showing the ads only to people in Canada. My competition at the time on adwords consisted of american competitors making no mention of Canada in their ads.

To outsmart them I only bidded on long tail keywords like “subaru forester hitch”. I made custom ads for each car models. I did this using excel to autogenerate a large amount of ads based on the car models. I’ll show how to do this in another post. So my ads looked like this:

Finding a supplier: the hard part!

I first called Curt MFG knowing that they were dropshipping for guys on ebay. I inquired about opening an account. They flat out told me no. They only open accounts for businesses that have a brick and mortar retail store front. Fuck. I told them “what about those guys on ebay?” Well they dont know about it and they dont feel like explaining themselves. Huh. I have this juicy underserved market and no way to get started without opening an actual store.

I started calling around all the hitch manufacturers, distributors, retailers. They all told me to go away or they were only willing to sell to me above normal retail pricing. I was seriously bummed out. I got my break on amazon.com . I looked up who was selling there:

Basically these guys are the top amazon sellers. They have good pricing. They are selling retail and they are willing to give amazon a 15% selling fee. Clearly for them dropshipping my orders would be a piece of cake. I looked up their websites on google. Then I emailed and called them. Just like I though they were all willing to dropship for me. Nice! I get my start with these guys with no commitment, no store front, no nothing. I just need to start selling and they fulfill for me.

Building the site on the cheap (Minimum effective solution)

I had the product idea, a traffic source, the USP and a dropshipping supplier. What was missing was a website that could convert this traffic. Building a site that sells auto parts is not easy. You cant just list your products and hope that the customers will figure out the right ones for their car model. You have to offer a menu where they their Make, Model and Year (ex: 2005 Ford Focus) and then display the right products. This feature is not standard in any shopping cart that I know of. I decided to build the site using the free open source shopping cart Magento + VehicleFit extension.

The next hurdle was getting the product description, product pricing and vehicle fitment data. Your typical car part supplier is used to selling to repair shops that call in for each orders. If you ask them to give you their product list with pricing they’ll get scared. These guys dont understand internet retailing at all.  Fortunately I had plenty of online competitors with perfectly fine websites from which to extract all the data I needed. I tried my hand at writing a scraping software, but I quickly realized it was that too hard. I had to hire someone to do the job.

Hiring a russian coder to scrape your competitor

Hiring someone that is good at scraping is going to be very expensive if do it locally. Being broke at the time, I decided to try odesk. I had good luck hiring russian programmers there for various project. I posted a job there and I found a guy who did a perfect job for $90. 

How to outsource your customer service for $2.5/h

My goal was passive income. Once sales and traffic started rolling in I hired someone in the philipinnes to do all the customer service, order processing with the supplier, etc. I found someone speaking excellent english willing to work full-time for $400/month on odesk!

The downfall: Curt screwing me out of the best pricing

I was not buying direct from Curt MFG as I explained in the section on getting the supplier. Around December 2012  US based competitors started getting in my canadian niche. They were offering retail pricing that was lower than my cost at my supplier. I tried calling Curt again now that I was selling a sizeable volume. They gave me the same bs: we only sell to brick and mortar stores. I was squeezed out of my main marketing channel: Adwords. You can only buy traffic that converts well otherwise you are losing money… Still the site now had some organic traffic that was generating some sales.

Selling out on flippa

I decided to get rid of this business on flippa.  The sites has good converting organic traffic. However the site is ugly and hasnt been updated with new products. I figure that someone else could turn this around and use the existing SEO to jumpstart things. You can probably take this site making $1k of profit/year and easily turn this into $5k profit/year just on the organic traffic if you got the right contacts in the industry.",4.0,2,2014-10-30,ECOM,0.058155154809355736,0.9121321141719818,0.029712741263210773

ecommerce,Ideal Ecommerce Business?,"Wanted to get some perspective from you guys here.

Was talking to a coworker and he long story short he was talking about leaving the company and starting his own business. 

I asked him doing what? His answer was an ecommerce store selling electronics such as servers, DIMMS, etc. basically equipment for the super technology geek. 

None of this really sounds ideal though? The margins on servers are low, shipping cost high, etc. BUT he is a technology guy so I guess he just wants to do what he enjoys. 

When you guys pick your ecommerce store do you pick the one that makes the most sense from a practical standpoint ie: looking at the margins, how easy it is to do fulfillment, number of skus you'll have, keyword analysis, etc. OR more on what's your true interest?

ecommerce,Bigcommerce fumbles by removing unique id from google feed url,"In late september bigcommerce decided to remove the unique private id from the url of customers google feeds in turn removing the only security mechanism to keep marketing data private.

This causes problems for anyone in a competitive re-sale market because their product lists and advertised prices are now publicly available.
