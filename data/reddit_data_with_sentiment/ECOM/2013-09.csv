ecommerce,What's your tip for selling unset inventories for a group online?,"Hey guys,

I just started a new gig building up an ecommerce presence for a guy, but the problem is the he doesn't have a set inventory. What I mean is that he goes out and finds cheap stuff on eBay or Craigslist (mechanical broken stuff or cars), fixes them up, and uses them in his own restaurant operations or sells them online. He has a very large inventory of items, a lot of hard to find stuff, but he doesn't get multiple items of the same product - just constant random stuff.

Obviously he uses eBay and Craigslist to sell this stuff, but does anyone have experience selling these unique things with no base supply? I'd offer a site for reference but he has nothing set up yet. . . But just imagine Diesel engines that are fixed up, cars that need blah fixed and replaced, odds and ends like that. .

A friend of mine asked me to build the site for him (thousands of products) and I've only really had experience with Wordpress. So naturally I was leaning toward WooCommerce. But after all the other factors that go into having an WooCommerce site (payment gateways, hosting, shipping options, etc.) I wasn't sure if I was making a mistake. I think the overall site would look better on WooCommerce though.

ecommerce,Choosing A Shopping Cart and a Developer for the Set up,"I'm rather new to the eCommerce scene but am trying to get our company's website up and running. We're a manufacturer &amp; converter that primarily sells to small and medium sized businesses. We're looking to expand our customer base geographically and to do higher margin but smaller orders to diversify and increase branding. This way we can increase our presence while using the website to help automate our order entry system (most of our orders are hand keyed into our accounting software, MAS 90 V 4.4) from a client's email or phone conversation.

Given our relationship with certain clients, I'd need the ability to set discount rates off published prices for distributors and large purchasers. I know I'm going to have to choose a shopping cart, and given our reliance on Sage's MAS 90, I'm thinking of using a shopping cart like Magento Community that has the user community and developer presence to get it off the ground. I'm thinking hiring someone from Elance or Odesk to start the development process on the backend of the site and install any relevant modules for integrating to MAS 90 and providing a general understanding so I can add products (we'll have several 1000 part numbers eventually) and do account maintenance for our distributors. It'd seem like my goal is to get a website up and running, eventually integrating with our accounting system since that's also how our order slips are printed and follow the product through the production process, and then develop as clean of a B2B site we can.

I know there's a lot of small things that are also needed like a SSL certificate, payment authorization (perhaps we can use MAS 90 for this?), and integrating UPS Worldship tracking back to MAS 90 and the website.

Does anybody have any advice about where to start the development process (where to get a decent Magento developer from Elance or Odesk) and if there's a shopping cart that may better fit our needs? In the meantime I'm reading as much as I can through the subreddit and definitely appreciate the community's contributions and points.

Edit: I have a budget of around $2,000 that's flexible slightly upwards depending on the level of integration",12,1,2013-09-05,ECOM,0.02373572252690792,0.9159606695175171,0.06030358001589775

woocommerce,Woocommerce premium extensions and templates,"7 years Zen Cart user here. Been convinced to make the shift to Woocommerce but feel like a fish out of the water.

I'm a small self owned online retailer and can't afford dropping hundreds of dollars on a whim while moving over to a new platform.

Which brings me to my point: Are there any places to download premium addons and extensions free of charge so I can test them? Ive seen 96down.com or something like that but I find them odd.. They charge you a membership fee (annually might I add) for what appears to be non-legal download access.. I want to reward the developers so I can get support and updates, not some random kid with a phishing website.

Hope anyone has found some good places.. Alternatively a demo site that had many of these plugins installed with admin demo access so I can properly test them..

I'm looking to really dive deep into e-commerce. I do know the fundamentals of business in a broad sense, but what I've learned through my studies and this subreddit is that e-commerce is in and of its own. I've really examined the three automated business chapters in the *4-Hour Workweek*, and I'm currently reading the *Lean Start-Up* and *Personal MBA*. However, what books, websites, video trainings, etc. would you recommend to understand the ins and outs of e-commerce? Thanks in advance!

ecommerce,I've noticed that Amazon has really had a huge effect on small manufacturing businesses in the U.S. from my experience. Anyone else seen this happen?,"Most people know that Amazon is big and sells a lot. Most people don't realize the extent to which 3rd Party companies sell on Amazon 
Marketplace (This is when a company lists its products on Amazon Marketplace, and pays Amazon a percentage of final value when it sells). The following data is from ChannelAdvisor's great blog, AmazonStrategies:

http://www.kevinlordbarry.com/uploads/3/6/5/4/3654649/2158799_orig.jpg

Take a look at 1P GMV and 3P GMV. GMV is Gross Merchandise Volume, or total sales. Third party GMV is substantially greater than one party GMV and is growing even faster, especially when you ignore digital products like e-books.

Who are these third party companies?

There are three basic types of third party companies. 

1) Amateurs (selling individual textbooks, etc.). Another class of amateurs has their own small product line and are on their way to being manufacturers.

2) Resellers, who buy products wholesale or arrange drop-ship agreements with manufacturers. They usually compete in the Buy Box with tens of other sellers for each product. Resellers can be huge corporations dealing with liquidation products, medium sized companies that are triumphs of efficiency and sourcing, or individuals doing extremely well for themselves moving product with Amazon FBA.

3) Manufacturers themselves, which are the prototypical small business and are the focus of this post. They are usually $10,000,000-$30,000,000 businesses that have been operating for a decade or a century. They own or manage factories and make physical products. Their main business is to sell the products to retailers for 20% over cost, and the retailers set prices 2x-3x over the wholesale cost before selling it to you.

I've worked extensively with three long standing manufacturers of physical goods (in jewelry, apparel, and furniture) and have spoken with about twenty more in various industries. Amazon is the first medium they've used that allows them to get their products up and connect with consumers immediately. Since their products are generally great, they start selling immediately, and this opens up a whole new world for manufacturers. 

Now, that would be good enough, right? Consumers win in this scenario since manufacturers can sell to consumers on Amazon much cheaper and with greater profits for themselves. Not yet.

Amazon's Good Deed

Like I mentioned, Amazon's easy to use marketplace is the only online medium that has ever worked out so well for companies that make products but are not savvy in e-commerce. The profits from Amazon are giving these businesses the opportunity to dip their toes in e-commerce, whether in data analysis, logistics, demand patterns, pricing, or technology

The real advantage to the world from all of this is just starting to appear: In every single example that I know of, the manufacturers are now getting the confidence to start seriously selling directly outside of Amazon, because of their experience on Amazon. A whole generation of businesses are moving to the web, to the benefit of consumers and the manufacturers. It's a complete worldview change.

Because so many businesses are experiencing the same transformation, software has appeared (the largest of which is ChannelAdvisor, but there are many) that lets companies manage sales on Amazon while expanding to eBay, Rakuten, Sears Marketplace, Newegg Marketplace, Groupon Goods, and more. It's all part of the new ability for manufacturers to sell online.

Thanks to Amazon, consumers are starting to get the choice to buy directly from thousands of businesses making amazing tangible products, which probably would not be online otherwise. 

EDIT: eBay, in principle, does the same thing as Amazon Marketplace. The difference is that eBay's reputation has been for amateurs for so long that manufacturers didn't know that mass sales can be had there. Since eBay can be posted on pretty easily with the same software that handles Amazon now, that perception is changing.",3,3,2013-09-13,ECOM,0.039601102471351624,0.9273431301116943,0.03305577114224434
ecommerce,I'm in the middle of Exploring Inventory Control Solutions,"For the past year I've been retooling how my company conducts itself.  So far I have:

Implemented Shipworks software to streamline shipping;
Reorganized the warehouse into pick areas and added bar codes to everything;
Implemented ReadyToShip Picking software to increase efficiency and remove errors in picking orders;
Hired an accountant and bookkeeper to help me turn around my accounting procedures in Quickbooks.

Now I am trying to figure out how to tie all this together with an inventory control program. 

I've looked at the more expensive solutions such as Fishbowl and Acctivate and Advanceprotech.

I've looked at the less expensive solutions such as Inflow.

EDIT:  Also added a trouble ticket and chat function through LIVEHELPNOW.net, forgot to mention that.  It helped reduce the number of emails and also gives our staff an easier way to flow questions.

Right now I'm trying out the Inventory Module that is part of QB Enterprise (since that is the QB program I use).  

Just posting this now to let you know what I'm doing, and if I figure out anything brilliant, I'll keep you posted.

If you have any suggestions, based on your experiences, I'm all ears.

ecommerce,Monthly discovery service looking to partner with a brick &amp; mortar with existing eCommerce to expand profit margin/lower CoG. Thoughts?,"Hi, I'm new the sub &amp; am currently at the wantreprenuer (I guess?) stage of development.

)

**Background**: I have 'Box of the Month"" product discovery site ready to go- I pull the trigger soon. 
I woke up with this idea &amp; it stayed with me. While sending out resumes, I took a break and spammed my social circles with an ""I have an idea. would you be interested?"" I have enough interest from my small pool of friends and acquaintances that I'm moving forward, for at least 3 months. 
I started planning, designing, building a site. I found &amp; setup payment gateways. I'm now getting ready to prep the site for launch.

**Current**: I'm sourcing my goods at retail price. These items are easy enough to find, IF you know what you're looking for and in the right place. Most online sources barely have a decent image, let alone important product information. My goal is to provide a neat and interesting discovery service with ""a sampling of items that you cannot find because of reason X, Y &amp; Z.""

**Immediate Plan**: Here's where my idea to partner with a retail establishment, which also sells online, comes into play. So far, I've focused on the experience and discovery of the items, while playing on users curiosity. I feel like moving forward I need to:
A.) Focus on user feedback while delivering a quality, fun &amp; unique experience.
B.) Lower the cost of monthly service to gain a larger audience.
C.) Maintain quality of items.

**Possibly Horrible Idea**: To achieve this, my next step likely step seems to be:  
Partnering with the store- Getting items at, or around cost, while promoting the Partner store, by linking Partner products on My ""delivered boxes items page.""

Is this a horrible idea? Will my user base abandon me for the retail site? Does anyone have any insight?",0,1,2013-09-15,ECOM,0.02131846733391285,0.9257203936576843,0.052961111068725586

dropship,Helping Drop-Shipping Wantrepreneurs,"For all you novice drop-shipping newbies, I'm exiting the drop-shipping business and I am getting rid of my personal business. I'm moving into bigger and better things. 

Because of this, I am willing to share my contacts, suppliers, and system of automation.

I've been running a drop-shipping system in a couple niches using an automated lister, and an Ebay pricing management app so that my only interaction with selling is doing the actual shipping. You can list thousands of items and manage them with this Ebay app for about a penny per listing, and with it you can control the parameters like min/max price. 

If you are a veteran Ebay seller, I can provide you with a fantastic app that lets you control your listings, set prices according to your parameters, and is cheap compared to the time spent on upkeep for thousands of listings. Increase your selling efficiency while decreasing the time investment. 

If you want to get into drop-shipping I will give you the contacts. I will not give each person the same contacts because flooding the market is counterproductive. 

I have no stake with any of these suppliers, I am not an employee or salesmen for any of these suppliers. If you want to get into drop-shipping message me and I will give you the knowledge I've acquired. I can only provide contacts and knowledge. This is not a guarantee of success. You will have to work, explore options, manage product lines, and seek out sales. 

Also, not validating myself for the ""Prove you're successful"" crowd. This isn't a pissing contest. If you don't want my information, don't take it.",1,0,2013-09-16,ECOM,0.039062052965164185,0.929781973361969,0.03115604817867279

ecommerce,Any harm in making your website sound bigger than it really is?,"I run a very simple niche electronic component website.  It's one of those sites where if you are looking for say, a USB cable...USB cables are basically all I sell.  I don't dozens of products, just a couple brands in multiple lengths.  I stock and ship my own products out of my home.

I want to increase sales, and increase my Adwords/Bing success (as everyone else big and small wants to do).   One thing I've always heard in my +10 years in sales has been the following two quotes.

#1.  ""If you want to make a million bucks, you've got to look like a million bucks.""

#2. ""Dress/Look/Act the part"".  Basically, if you want to be the major seller on the block, you need to appear to be the major seller.

With those things said.   Is there anything wrong with advertising that my business is larger than it is?  When I buy from a website online, I'm always hesitant to buy from what appears to be a smaller business.  I just don't want to get ripped off or have my credit stolen by some con artist.

I was thinking of doing the following:
Making a blog post saying we hit a milestone, say X number of orders. (inflated)
Saying I have more employees than I really have with info on them, kind of a bogus ""meet our staff"".

Is there any harm in doing these things?   I realize it's not entirely ethical, but in the end if I'm still providing a great product, quickly, at a great price and with great service...what's it matter?

I hope I didn't come off as a sleeze ball, but I can assure you I run a very clean ship!",13,6,2013-09-21,ECOM,0.04115600511431694,0.9254475235939026,0.033396463841199875

ecommerce,Reddit -- Help me help my store.,"I work for http://www.x-wear.com/ in their e-commerce/web division. We just redesigned our site, and are still going through massive changes to our product descriptions and adding our listings to Google Shopping. We're running two stores, one on Yahoo Shopping and one on Shopify. The Yahoo storefront does more business, and we're looking to really boost the sales on x-wear, our store that runs on Shopify.

I've been getting content up in the form of weekly blogs, updating all our social media, writing 300+ word product descriptions, and trying to add product descriptions where we don't have any. We have over 70,000 SKU's, so writing all of those alone would be a challenge. 

We have email retargeting software that sends emails after customers abandon carts, live chat that runs for 13 hours a day, active social media, and beyond that I can't think of a way to drive more sales to the site. *I* personally think that the product descriptions are the biggest hurdle we are facing, but a lot of my coworkers seem to disagree.

How can I help keep our web division afloat over the winter? I like my job and I very much want to keep it. This company has ignored their E-Commerce for 10 years, and I was hired to help them 'get up to speed' so to speak. We've averaging $500 in sales a week, if that.

Any tips or tricks would be much appreciated.",24,0,2013-09-23,ECOM,0.034931961447000504,0.9213752150535583,0.04369279742240906

ecommerce,I am a beginning web developer (~1 year) looking to allow customers to pay a one-time fee to access my website. What is the best way in your opinion to go about doing this?,"I have been trying to use Paypal for a while, but after being frustrated with them for so long, I have decided to see if there is anything else out there that will accomplish this task. 

**&lt;paypal type=""rant"" required=""false""&gt;**

Firstly, their website is really confusing...they have 3 separate domains, paypal.com, devleoper.paypal.com, and sandbox.paypal.com. It is really frustrating to switch between these sites because depending upon what you click on, Paypal will log you out of some of them randomly and it just becomes a really painful and frustrating experience. So 90% of my time seems to be devoted to logging in to various paypal websites and I never get anything done.

On top of that, they didn't seem to offer a service that directly fit my need. I am not shipping any product---I just want to charge a one-time $10 fee to have users have access to my site, and then I want a message to be sent upon completion of payment to my database giving them access. However, out of the countless number of confusing services Paypal offers (which takes forever to sort though), the only option that seems reasonable is ""Payments Standard"" and this forces me to include irrelevant information such as ""quantity"" and shipping details. Maybe these are just the default settings and there is a work around, but due to the confusing nature of how the website is set up, I can't troubleshoot and experiment. It constantly logs me out of one of the three sites or does some other random annoying thing.

At one point, I got something to work, but then it would randomly stop working. Then at another point, it wouldn't work, and I changed something stupid that shouldn't be the reason something goes from not working to working (like I changed some random thing like ""Item name"" or something) and it worked. 

At one point the documentation was outdated and so I was forced to ask questions on stackoverflow, but people who don't know Paypal requires programming would just close my question for vague reasons like ""we have closed your question because it is about Paypal and not about programming"". Even though my question was completely about programming.

Now the documentation is perhaps up to date, but I don't understand any of it. I need someone to ELI5.

**&lt;/paypal&gt;**

So I'm pretty much done with Paypal. I just checked google checkout but I saw that they are discontinuing it/merging with google wallet/whatever and I don't want to deal with another situation where the company is doing a complete redesign while I am trying to use their product (Paypal changed completely a few months ago while I was trying to figure out how to use it and it messed everything up).

Sorry for the long post. Any suggestions?",2,0,2013-09-24,ECOM,0.12274730205535889,0.8545774817466736,0.022675219923257828

ecommerce,Launch your site with WordPress + WooCommerce and save!,"Hi /r/ecommerce

Haven't seen much discussion about WooCommerce around here, it's pretty much *the* ecommerce platform built on top of WordPress. So you get the ease of use, extensibility and cheapness (i.e Free!) of WP without the pain of Magento or similar solutions. 

However, whilst the base plugin [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) provides enough functionality to get an initial store up and running you soon realise you might need to spend quite a bit on [extensions](https://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/) to add required functionality. This is where we come in :) We offer 40+ WP extensions, themes and plugins for only $25/month or $5 individually. See the deal here: [gplclub.org/club/](https://gplclub.org/club/)

Love to get a discussion going about WooCommerce if anyone's used it and what your thoughts are.. 

Thanks!",2,0,2013-09-26,ECOM,0.01823081634938717,0.9080022573471069,0.07376696169376373
