ecommerce,"POD is a POS when it comes to trying to compete with Amazon in, say, tshirts, leggings, dresses, etc...","Amirite?

I've got a really great site, designed beautifully, my POD designs are all designed by me, a nationally awarded graphic designer, and are well received by everyone who sees them (though none actually buy) and I'm pretty experienced running a successful ecommerce site with and without marketing having owned another $250k annually earning one in a different market (not clothing).

But I can't help but think ... even at the lowest price I can offer, say, Printful's leggings and turn a measly few bucks profit, you can find similarly designed (though not quite the same, but good enough) for literally a fraction of my prices on Amazon. Why would anyone buy from me then? Not to mention the trouble of trying to drive traffic to a new clothing website. 

It just seems like an exercise in futility. At this point, I'm only keeping it since it's a great tool to have in my back pocket when I meet new chicks here and there... They're usually very impressed, I give them my card, some even end up modeling for me.

dropship,Are there any resources available on becoming a drop shipping supplier?,"Hello,

I own a company which focuses on selling women's fashion accessories and handbags. I would like to find a way to get in touch with dropshippers to market and sell my product.

The idea would be for the dropshippers to sell the items at whatever price they want, forward me the orders, and let me deal with everything from there from logistics to customer service. 

An added incentive for drop shippers to pick my company would be a bonus commission based on how much gross sales or number of orders are generated.

dropship,Help building supplier relationship - New Customer Credit Authorization form,"Hi,

I am totaly new to ecommerce, drop shipping and building supplier relationships. I have found a supplier who is willing to drop ship the baby products I am interested in and they seem eager to move forward, and I am very excited!

So, after I acknowledged their interest to pursue, I asked for their wholesale pricing to see if the margins would make sense for me. To which they replied with a new customer credit authorization form. I am not sure if this form is necessary at this stage nor am I familiar with the form. The form requires information such as my contact, address, bank info (account#) and my other supplier info.

I would love advice on what the form is for, whether I need it now or push it to a later date once I have made sense of pricing and in general how to pursue further.

dropship,WoW... Just WoW,"Why does this subreddit exist? I have spent three days reading through posts and I still don't understand what the point of this subreddit is. People have post after post where they are asking legit questions and they get shot down like a rabid dog. They are berated for not doing their own research. Time and again are told to google... well guess what?! GOOGLE SENT ME HERE... WHILE DOING RESEARCH! 

I'm not sure if some of the folks here who answer in an aggressive manner are jaded somehow... because that's what it sounds like... but when I read one poster ask ""Should I sell on Amazon, Ebay or Shopify?""  I took it as he would like to know your experience with either. Someone else replied, ""if you're asking you shouldn't be selling at all""  Like what the hell?  

Many of you need a hug. Like seriously.  This is what life has taught me... 5 people can sell the exact same item and each can be successful because each will have their own approach, their own target audience, their own mojo.   Believe me, there is room for everyone to succeed. Stop holding on to knowledge so tight. Just because you share some of that knowledge doesn't mean it will come easily to the person you are sharing it with. Again, it seems people on here want you to do research until you sweat blood before asking for help.  For some, the hardest thing is to ask a question because they are putting themselves out there and here comes someone who just crushes you for no damn reason.

If you don't want to give information for free then just tell the person I can share my list or spreadsheets or whatever for a fee instead of being an ass and saying ""dude, when are you going to learn that no one is going to give you things for free that took them years to learn?"".  

Why make it harder for the next guy?  I don't get it. You don't have to break anything down just through a bone or two... breadcrumbs, and not just Google.  Give the person a keyword... something helpful. In fact, stop referring people to Google, it's not the greatest all the time. 

Subreddits are like communities to me. People in communities like this one should want to see everyone win. One person told another to not get excited over one sale. Just wow! It's not to say that you can't tell not so happy truths about certain aspects of the business. It's just you don't get anything out of this subreddit at all that is constructive.

ecommerce,best layout for products....,"Hello everyone.  I'm currently adding apparel to my e-commerce business and would like your opinion on the two directions I can take the layout of the items for sale.  

1)  Apparel broken down my mens and women, and by category, etc.  I hesitate to do this as I personally (what I like doesn't matter here tho) do not like to have to click thru drop down after drop down to get to the category I want.  MENS&gt;SHIRTS&gt;CATEGORY&gt;THEN SEARCH  the items

OR

2)  Just MENS and WOMENS.  Then it' just a product dump.  The frustration here is that if you're looking for a certain type of shirt you may have to scroll thru a lot of product to get to the one(s) you want.  The benefit though is that you may come across something else you like in addition or in place of your original search.  

It's a more surgical search versus a more antique shopping experience.  Both seem to have their +'s and -'s but I'm not sure which would be best for this scenario.  I had considered doing the less specific breakdown and including a little sentence about ""enjoy browsing our store, if you are after something specific, the search function is your friend"" or something like that.

ecommerce,Good conversion rate; how can I get more traffic?,"To the nitty gritty: our t-shirt shop has a well-defined niche (Disney) and we know our target demo (females 25-45). We're active on Instagram (1500 followers) but not doing much else in social. We've tried Adwords and FB ads to literally no luck yet. 

We're getting around 1900 visits to our website each month lately, and about 27 sales each month on average, hitting right around 1.4-1.5% conversions, which I think is good if not great. But we're just lost on getting more traffic. The average is around 60 per day, but it fluctuates from 20-100. Days with 20 visitors, no surprise, result in no sales. 

Anyone have any advice? While I'd love a silver bullet, I'm realistic. Do I just need to keep throwing money at the problem? The biz isn't profitable yet, but I have a good day job and wouldn't be opposed to dropping a few hundred a month if i could see real movement.

ecommerce,Conversion rate optimization Tips,"I'm here to help you improve your conversions and teach you which analytics stats are important.

#1 Improve your site speed
Use page speed tool (google it :)) to check your site and find someone who can improve/fix basic problems with your images, ...

#2 Use HotJar (it's free) 
or any other tool for heat maps. You will better understand how a visitor uses your site.

#3 Landing page 
- Find pain. Offer relief. Get paid! :)
What are the top 3 questions you get from potential customers? Answer all of them + tell them about YOUR solution = $$$
- Include multiple calls to action on a single page.
- The three best colors for CTA buttons: red, green, orange. Test red button and see what happens :) Maybe it won't be the best fit for your shop/niche/service. To get the most contrast, pick a complimentary color: one that is opposite to your dominant/primary color.
- Test different calls-to-action. 
- Use high-quality images  - This is VERY important!
- Test different images - of the product, of the product being used, of happy customers holding the product.
- Add testimonials and reviews from happy customers to boost up your credibility.
- Test prices that end with a seven or a nine. Items with these prices tend to sell better than those with prices that end with a zero.
- Create a sense of urgency.

#4 Checkout
Simple checkout adjustments can make all the difference. 
- Offer few payment options.
- Use testimonials and reviews.
- Add trust badges.
- Have a clear call to action.

#5 Thank you page
- Include an upsell or limited time offer.
- Ask them to follow you on social media and share your site.
- Add links to your best content.
- Display testimonials.

ecommerce,Do you know your numbers? (Part 1),"I'm here to help you improve your conversions and teach you which analytics stats are important :)

What does your Google Analytics stats say? Bellow, you can find few important stats that you should check every day.

#1 What's your conversion rate, average order value (AOV), transactions, revenue? 
In Analytics under: Conversions &gt; Ecommerce &gt; Overview
Tip: If your conversion rate is below 2% (for webshop) I really hope your AOV and profit is high otherwise I'm not sure how can you survive in this industry.

#2 What's your main traffic source (Facebook, AdWords, media buy, organic search, direct traffic, newsletter, ...)? What conversion rate does each source have?
In Analytics under: Acquisition &gt; All Traffic &gt; Source/Medium
Tip: Now you know your best-converting source. Push some more traffic and exclude sources that don't convert!

#3 Do you have more mobile or desktop traffic? Which converts best?
In Analytics under: Audience &gt; Mobile &gt; Overview
Tip: 90% of webshops have more mobile traffic, but desktop traffic converts better. Create remarketing audience in Facebook and AdWords and push some ads for desktop only to collect some 'low hanging fruits.' :)

#4 What is your best-converting state? 
In Analytics under: Audience &gt; Geo &gt; Location &gt; United States 
Tip: Now you can see your best-converting state. Create Facebook ads with selected states only OR exclude less converting states from targeting.
++ use Source/Medium as a Secondary dimension &gt; you will see which source sends you less converting states.

#5 Age and gender
In Analytics under: Audience &gt; Demographics &gt; Overview

#6 IMPORTANT: UTM tags
Please, please use UTM tags in your links. This will help you identify your winner's way faster. Search for more info if you don't know what UTM tags are.

Would it be possible to give me some feedback regarding the value/utility of a tool I'm currently building? While studying some tech, I ended with a proof of concept that enables e-commerce sites to engage with its visitors by showing real time/automated notifications.


What does this mean? I've imagined a few use cases like:


* User A is on a given product page. User B adds one of the last two items in stock. User A gets a real time notification regarding the stock availability.


* Site owner wants to run a flash sale? Press a button and all current visitors are notified.


* Site owner needs to shift  a given product? Every visitor that lands on a similar product gets a custom notification like ""Product 'A' trending""


All of this just by adding a script tag to the website.

I need to collect standard sales tax for my state but I also need to collect 'Use Tax' for the state of my vendor/dropshipper. This would be fine except that the state of my dropshipper has *completely* different rates for their Sales and Use taxes. 

Shopify only uses Sales Tax rates so that means I need standard tax rates for my state and then completely custom tax rates for my vendor's state.

The only option apparent to me is to add a ""physical presence"" for literally every single zip code in that state and then set custom overrides for every county, city, and town. That's completely unmanageable, and a non-starter for me.

Another option might be to set the vendor's state tax rate to 0% and then set an override for the state, several overrides for counties, and several more overrides for cities and towns. Unfortunately that doesn't seem possible.

ecommerce,"Your strategy for launching 10,000+ SKUs on Amazon in an extremely competitive market?","Hey Reddit family!

Been selling on our brand on our own website and it makes sense to open up another sales channel via Amazon. It's an extremely competitive category (cell phone cases), so looking to run AMS and aggressive bidding/promos for traction.

My strategy would be to optimize listings (copywrite/photos/back/front-end keywords), run PPC (long-tail as main keyword clicks are insanely high) for review generation and to help organic rankings.

1) Promos. I'm all for this knowing that it'll pay in the long run. What's best way to approach this? How many units? We have an existing email list so we could definitely leverage that and drive traffic to some listings.
2) Is there a way to set up, and more importantly, edit listings in bulk? Thinking of starting with 50 or so listings and growing the portfolio from there
3) PPC management - how easy is it to manage campaigns for 50 to potentially 10,000+ SKUs? Any software that can help with this? Best practices as far as nomenclature and structuring for reporting purposes?
4) Any other way you'd approach this strategy? Again, extremely competitive category.

shopify,Shopify and multiple warehouses?,"Hello,

Looking to get some information about Shopify to see if it can solve a problem a company I consult for is experiencing with Weebly.

The company I consult for is an organization for artists around the country.  This organization provides an online store, as well as booth space at various conventions (Comicon / Wondercon / D23 / etc).

Currently, their #1 problem is dealing with accurate shipping costs.  Each SKU/item potentially can be shipped from different parts of the country (e.g. each artist has their own inventory).

I'm wondering if with Shopify you can set up the location of where each item is stored, in order to get accurate shipping costs.

In addition, as they are artists, they work with multiple types of packaging. Sometimes you can fit 4 prints in one cardboard tube, sometimes it is books and graphic novels, other times they are shipping framed art, each of which scenario require different packaging and weights.

From the requirements I've listed here, does Shopify seem to be a correct fit? And does the basic plan support this? Or would an upgrade to a different plan be required?

dropship,Market Research,"For a while I have been thinking of a way to make drop-shipping easier for the thousands that do it everyday.

The idea? A website that takes away all stressful elements of drop-shipping and makes it something that it more manageable and less time consuming.

The main premise being that you would just tell us the website of which you are ordering the product, the item number, quantity and shipment address and we do the rest for you.

Once you've sent your request for your orders, we then quickly work through them and send you an itemised bill via PayPal of everything that you have ordered - you check your invoice and pay in one click.
There really would be no inconvenience at all and would clearly free up a lot of time in your day.

This also means that we would handle all the customer service problems that your customers may have. Let us know if a customer hasn't received their item and we'll refund you - as simple as that.

Now, of course, there would be a fee to use this service and here's what I propose:

3.6% fee on top of item price to cover PayPal fees. (Applicable to UK residents, may differ to those overseas).

and a selection of monthly subscriptions of which features would increase depending on what your monthly subscription plan costs.

So just as a 'show of hands', who anyone be interested if this was to be a thing?

Some were my errors and in customer's mind they are just more reasons to switch platforms.  Customer wants ""a shopping cart and not a Wordpress site with a bunch of plugins.""

Was on oscommerce before. It's too hard to keep that up to date. Same with zen.

Customer prefers source code solution she ""owns"" over rented shopify, volusion type rentals.

I've looked at magneto code and threw that out as requiring a ton of effort to support.

Features required: real time usps,  ups, special messages at checkout warning about tarrifs for some destinations (if Canada then warn about customs fee...),  auth net, solid seo,  multiple pictures per product. Speed is paramount. Updates must be automatic rather than manual code ""tree diff"" slogs.  HUGE need for historical stock reporting only because customer is always sure there's a ghost in the machine changing stock on hand. Must interface with shipstation. Must not require renting dedicated credit card man in the middle server as xcart does.

ecommerce,"Looking for the best way to handle multiple countries, languages, currencies and bank / PayPal accounts","Hi there,

I am currently working on an ecommerce store for a company that is operating in 10 countries with multiple languages and currencies. The site system is WordPress and I have yet to find a system which lets me have multiple bank or PayPal accounts so that a customer from the US sends the money to the US paypal account or to the US bank account in US$ and a customer from Germany sends his money to a German PayPal / bank account in €.
Also the content should be multilingual then. Which maybe is doable with WPML or so but if the shop can handle it itself it would be even better.

First of all: is that even a good idea or would it be better to have one central account in the main country where every customer sends the money too? It would be a lot of fees for the customers no? And who actually has to pay all the fees? For banking accounts it depends or is it the receiver? And how is it for PayPal?
Questions over questions. I hope some of them can be answered by you guys because Google didn't help me out that much and I am totally confused as to what would be the best approach in that situation.

ecommerce,Debating between SquareSpace and Shopify for Beta?,"Hey guys,

I'm working on the Beta launch of a multi-vendor e-commerce site that sells digital services. The Beta will be small - we will have about 10 stores, each selling about 3 services. I expect each store to only get about 5 orders during the period of the Beta. So that's about 50 orders total in ~1 month.

Please keep in mind that I have almost no web dev experience, but I do have backend coding experience (ML).

Basically, I'm debating whether to use SquareSpace or Shopify for this Beta only.

**SquareSpace:** I would need to manually create each of the 10 stores (which is not hard, as each store only has 3 products, and they are very simple). I would also need to manually forward purchase info to the appropriate store-owner so they could get to work. Finally, all the payments would have to flow to my Stripe account, and then I'd have to manually pay out my store owners. On the upside, SquareSpace is extremely easy for me, and I already have most of the skeleton set up. It also looks great.

**Shopify:** I have not tried Shopify at all yet, but I know it has a multi-vendor marketplace app that would allow each of my store owners to set up their own store, and receive payments and orders directly without any manual work from me. Shopify is more expensive (but that's fine) and it seems to look uglier than SquareSpace. I am also concerned about making my store owners maintain their own stores. These guys are not super tech savvy, and I'm worried they will feel overwhelmed and quit my program. I don't want them to learn a bunch of new systems just to process 3 orders, when I could just deal with SquareSpace myself and forward the orders to them.

**Overall**: I'm not concerned about scaling at the moment, and I'm not concerned about cost. The Beta is really a proof of concept, so I'd like to set it up in a way that is low-friction both for me and for the store owners. Of course, things need to work and look relatively good. Our potential customers will be relatively sensitive to how things look. Which should I choose?",6,3,2017-06-20,ECOM,0.030180394649505615,0.9313027262687683,0.03851686418056488

dropship,"100k+ in sales per month, how we got there without Google/Facebook ads. AMA","Before I begin, why we are doing this AMA:


I was asked to write this post by a fellow dropshipper I met through Oberlo’s forums who bought a guide for almost $1000 and basically completely wasted their money. I just want to say that you should never ever ever buy expensive guides on how to make a millions of dollars drop shipping. It is a total scam.  You don’t need to be told ‘pick a niche that nobody is in.’ We’ve read enough sad stories on /r/digitalnomad and /r/dropship to know people are getting cleaned from these stupid guides. We are going to respond to every single comment made in this thread for the next 30 days and hopefully thereafter and we’re going to do it for free. 


This is a throwaway account. I messaged the mods a couple of weeks ago so that they can verify our sales for an AMA but have yet to receive a response. I am still happy to verify our sales if a mod messages or posts here. Until then, here is some light proof of our sales March - June: http://i.imgur.com/UX0sztj.png


**A little about our business:**

* We are in a niche that nobody or nearly nobody is in. We’re not disclosing our site or our niche.

* We’ve never used a Facebook or Google ad, though we have tried other ad services more targeted towards our niche

* Reddit/Imgur marketing is responsible for 98%+ of our sales

* We use Shopify to run our store and we exclusively use AliExpress to buy our goods.


**Marketing**
We are a team of two. Right off the bat we decided to try some ads, they didn’t go great. After tweaking the ads, we were able to break even. We decided to go with a different route and started marketing our site through Reddit and buy upvotes to get to the front page. We decided to go with a firm that also makes content for a reasonable price. There are sites the straight up sell Reddit upvotes, but the problem is that they are not immediate. With the firm we are able to tell them exactly when we are going to post. The first hour of the post is crucial, that is when the upvotes count the most so you want to get them on as fast as possible. On our very first campaign we knew this was the route to go. The post made it to the front page and we got over 1 million impressions along with 60k clicks. We were never able to repeat that success and now get between 5k-20k clicks per campaign. We started marketing on Imgur so that we could recycle some old campaigns with new people, it worked well. The click through rate is much higher on imgur but the conversion rate is much lower.


**Site**
Our site is simple, but clean. We put a lot of design time into it for what you see. It looks like a basic Shopify template because it is. Regardless, we put a lot of time into the descriptions, selecting photos, and product tags. Probably about an hour each. We keep only 50 products on the site, we don’t want to overwhelm people. We don’t have any tacky ‘spin for a discount’ pop-up on our site or anything resembling that.


**Customer Data**
We take our analytics seriously. What’s most important is to figure out what time of day your visitors are most likely to make a purchase, that way you aim your campaigns to be viral around that time. If you don’t have Google Analytics enabled, do so immediately. We pay for Shopify’s $300/month plan and get access to their custom reports which are also quite helpful for certain situations. Don’t sweat over your analytics if you only have a few dozen sales, they don’t mean much. Try marketing towards different subreddits and use very different post styles to find a sweet spot, then use that data to expand from there.


**Common Mistakes**


**Are you dropshipping something like watches, t-shirts, or sunglasses?** All I can say is good luck. A million people have tried it and maybe a half-dozen have succeeded. Don’t dropship stupid shit that everybody else is also trying to sell. If you are dropshipping something super common and haven’t had success, I suggest you delete everything and start from scratch.


**Are you bending over backwards for your customers?** Don’t. In our experience and many fellow dropshippers, profit is made from bringing in new customers, not repeat customers or word-of-mouth. You are going to drive all of your own traffic, people are going to barely talk about your site if at all. Don’t worry too much about your reputation. This doesn’t mean you should be rude to your customers. You should still be overbearingly nice, but don’t give people refunds if they put in the wrong address, didn’t like the product, didn’t know it was from China, etc. You are trying to make two people happy: yourself and your supplier, which leads me to my next point


**Are you using a bunch of different suppliers?** Don’t. Consolidate and make sure all of your products are coming from the same warehouse or two tops. This should be obvious. It saves shipping costs, it saves time, and all of your products arrive together for large orders. Also, the more you are buying from a supplier the more leeway you’ll have with them. For example, we can request our supplier stock any item and match the lowest price we can find for it because we are such a large percentage of their business. As your dropshipping business grows, you will be able to get suppliers to do pretty much anything for you. 


These are some of the absolute core basics I could think of off the top of my head. We can answer questions about shipping, affiliate links, software, money invested into campaigns, whatever you all want to hear about we're happy to oblige.

Ask away.

i dont know if my question makes sense? but im asking because if someone orders more than 1 product then they will receive them individually. Let me know how you guys use it.

dropship,AliExpress / Amazon product association / price comparison Chrome Extension by Convenior (free),"**UPDATE:**
Multiple users have left us feedback in regard to the plugin simply displaying ""currently searching"" for some products; it's now apparent to us that this text is not concise enough, and ~~we're going to update~~ we have updated it. There are at least a couple of possibilities that might explain why you might see the ""currently searching"" message. It could be that we haven't yet queried Amazon for those specific products and thus the system is waiting for possible associations (in which case you may need to wait up to an hour or so to see results for those items), and it could also be that those items are not present on Amazon or at least that our current search techniques have not detected them (we are continuously working to improve the accuracy of our search).

The more popular or commonly searched for the items you're viewing, the more likely that we'll already have results for some of those products in our system; the number of products we are tracking will grow as more users view products with the plugin enabled.

Please note that once you do see results, they will be stored in our system, so if you are keeping an eye on a specific category or search term, you'll likely only have to wait for results on new items as opposed to all of them. Also, certain categories are better than others in terms of accuracy, sports equipment (fishing lures or fishing hooks I know for sure are pretty good) for example is good, while the clothing categories usually have less accurate association results.

Thank you for the feedback, and we'll continue to improve the plugin with the help of your feedback :)

--------------------------------------------------------


We have been working for the past couple of months on a plugin with the goal to aid dropshippers in quickly locating profitable or favourable products to sell. It works with AliExpress by automatically detecting items also listed on Amazon and displaying useful information such as images and pricing. Our product is in active development, and as such, please note that there may be bugs (if you encounter one, please let us know via the feedback mechanism in the plugin or via this reddit post).
 
Creating an account and using the extension is free - we only ask that you please give us feedback so that we may improve it :)
 
We’ve created a brief video that shows how to use the extension:

Download the Chrome extension here:

Also, please note that we currently only support Amazon.com, but depending on user enthusiasm, we will also consider supporting other sites. We are also considering implementing a feature in which users can manually confirm that a product is a match (or very likely to be a match) in order to improve our statistics and results.
 
Again, we would absolutely love any feedback, so please let us know about bugs, ideas for features, enhancements, and the like.",13,23,2017-06-26,ECOM,0.029559558257460594,0.9311188459396362,0.039321642369031906

ecommerce,"Thought our fb video would drive some traffic, or at least engagement. But, nope.

A little about our store: 
We travel and hand source products being made by artisans, craftspeople, etc in developing countries. We visited their workshops, filmed, interviewed, purchased a bunch of inventory, and now it's sitting here in the US waiting to be sold. 

I target the ad to 25-50 age in a relatively well-off city, with interests in crafts, sustainability, environmentalism, ecotourism.

dropship,I made an entire drop shipping website for fun with imported and tested products.,"Hi guys, this is actually my first post EVER on reddit.  I am a past entrepreneur that was drop shipping products on ebay from Amazon and realized that there was money to be made using this method.  I got fed up with ebay after the hassle of dealing with their customer support and how they control every single detail of your shop (e.g. throttling the items you can list with $$$ limits).  Also, it was beginning to get saturated with drop shippers copying my successful items. 
 So I decided to put together a drop shipping website, and see how it goes.  I was wondering if any drop shippers out there have any advice for a newbie trying to drive traffic to their website.  I'm sure I'll get massive hate slung at me for this type of business but I'm alright with this.  I currently use Facebook and Instagram and noticed that my website visitors have increased...barely.  Any advice?  Thanks in advance.  My website is an online jewelry store.

ecommerce,Our recent fraud experience,"Since I'm all fired up about it, I wanted to throw up a quick post to help others avoid the situation we're now finding ourselves in.

Late last Friday, a nice lady called to order a pocket bike over the phone. She wanted to get a gift for her nephew. She tried ordering with another store but since the addresses were different, they put a hold on her funds for 5 days. So she called us so she could speak with someone to order b/c she needed to get the gift out and didn't want to risk another hold. In retrospect, she was a smooth-talking, professional thief.

We allow different billing/shipping addresses. When these come in, we'll call each customer to screen for fraud. The past week had more than usual, but nothing extraordinary. 

This morning, I got a call from Volusion (we use their platform and payment processing) that some of the payments collected look fraudulent. Since then, I've been scrambling to dig out as best I can.

Investigating further, I can only imagine we were targeted by fraudsters. We spoke with some of them on the phone to verify address discrepancies. It's too soon to know the total losses just yet and I'm afraid to do the math.

* We use a Fraud Score service that is supposed to indicate order risk. Only one order scored low. I personally spoke with the low score customer who was able to verify enough detail to make me comfortable.
* Each order had a different shipping and billing addresses. All addresses except one billing address were in the greater Chicago area.
* All customer IPs were in the Chicago area
* All email addresses seemed to go with the order name and were either aol, yahoo, or gmail
* Most were free (and slower) shipping but the last few paid extra for expedited shipping
* UPS said they will cancel and return the orders in transit for a small fee. I image other carriers will too.

I called the FBI and they told me to file a report here: https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx. We'll see what comes of it if anything.

I had more success with the local Secret Service office and send the agent all the details I had on the fraudulent orders. He passed it along to the Chicago Secret Service office. We'll see where that goes.

I am calling the PD of the cities where items were delivered in the hope that they'll send an officer out to recover the item.

Depending on chargebacks and fees, this could end up crippling us. I hope sharing this experience helps someone else and will try to come back with a follow up if anyone is interested.",7,7,2017-06-28,ECOM,0.0930749922990799,0.8804194331169128,0.026505591347813606

dropship,Dropship vape products?,I've been reading as much as I can on dropshipping all I need now is a product. Or type of product.

ecommerce,Naive Question on Shipping / Pickup,"Hello
Forgive me for these questions.. I have never worked in ecommerce.

But, I plan on shipping about 10 items a day, maximum.
The boxes will be small (maybe about the size of 4 shoe boxes) but fairly heavy.

I plan on using Shopify.

I already work from home (condo) so I can prep the stuff.

But here is what I am wondering: can UPS/Fed Ex come directly to my unit in my cnodo and get the stuff? Or will I have to go to my condos drop point and drop them off? Will I see the same guy often and be able to ask him specific things? Will they usually come at differnt times?

I guess my question is : how hands off can I get with it?

THanks for your help. Any help would be great.",1,4,2017-06-30,ECOM,0.029128149151802063,0.92048579454422,0.05038604140281677

woocommerce,Customer receives another customer address?,"So I got a cryptic email from fulfilment with a screenshot, showing that a customer had received another customer address through email. Immediate red-alert turns on ""PII"", ""data-breach"", £#%$!*!?

Because we have had so many email related issues (it's honestly stupid how robust our email process has become for this client), we setup logging every single email as it's sent via injected BCC field to support address, so we can see exactly what is sent, that it is sent, to who, etc. It's a little annoying to have production issues like this, but in testing and staging no reported issues, just customers, so after ensuring DKIM, after checking spam status, ensuring SPF correct etc, we decided it's best to give support a copy, for our records, and to ensure the customer isn't being asked for details we have.

Looking at the emails, no customer has received another customer address (can't even find an email with an address field within).

This leaves us with two likely scenarios.

* Someone in zendesk (support sw) has accidentally, or via zendesk filters sent one customer another's email.
* Someone in fulfilment has accidentally sent one customer another customer shipping details.

As we're european, that's basically like shooting your face off, however you cross those wires, people's data is important. ***I'd like to know anyway if anyone has experienced a situation where woocommerce can make mistakes and cross boundaries in customer data as I haven't yet ruled it out despite overwhelming evidence that it hasn't happened?*** (don't need to know how, just if)

The main similarities for this order is that both orders involved are shipping to the same care-of physical address. (I think they are shadow drop-shipping, but IDC so much about that as other things).

 ***Should note I can't send the emails (PII), I can't mention who my client is, I don't need technical support.I Just find it to be a really strange problem, wanted to see if anyone else has encountered***.

I should also mention we are using multi-site with Woo, but I've checked there is no order in another site DB that is accidentally containing either customer details, they are both on one site of the network. I know Woo isn't really for Multi-site, it adds complexity.",6,3,2017-06-30,ECOM,0.11195403337478638,0.8677206635475159,0.020325254648923874
