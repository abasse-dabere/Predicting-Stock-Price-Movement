ecommerce,Local tax for in-state online sales?,"Ok, so I'm about ready to open the doors for our online store. We're based in Washington state and in Washington state sales tax is 6.5%, BUT there is also a local tax. So, with both combined for Vancouver, WA it ends up being 8.2% (which is where our store is).

So, I know for on-line sales that occur in Washington we charge sales tax. Fair enough, but do I also have to charge the respective local tax as well, even though we don't have a ""presence"" in that state? Has anyone really had experience with this?

I'd obviously like to charge a flat rate since it's MUCH easier to set-up. That, plus the fact that there is around 356 territories in Washington and most of them charge different percentages for local tax. It seems like this information would be available online but I couldn't find anything that said for sure. I did find the rates at the Department of Revenue but not anything about charging for it online.

TL;DR Do I have to charge both state and local taxes for in-state e commerce sales?",2,5,2011-05-25,ECOM,0.02803879603743553,0.9314419627189636,0.04051928222179413
