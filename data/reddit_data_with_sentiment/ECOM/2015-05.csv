ecommerce,Getting your first 50 customers,"For the last few months I’ve been researching the best ways for new online stores to find customers.

A lot of the advice is theoretical: 7 steps, 3 magic ways,.. But I’ve found that it is really useful to see how someone in a similar situation succeeded. 

That’s why I want to write a post on how online stores that have gotten some traction, got their first 50 customers.

I’ve already found 6 stores to write about, but I think it will get more interesting if I cover more stores and different markets.

So if your store has 50+ customers, I’d love to hear what approaches you took to get those first 50! I'll include that story a short intro and link to your store.

*Update 26/5*: Post is published at http://www.storegrowers.com/how-to-get-the-first-50-customers-for-your-online-store/",16,11,2015-05-01,ECOM,0.025766851380467415,0.9267708659172058,0.04746229574084282
ecommerce,Inventory Management,"I work for a company which sells product on site at events using Square and also through an ecommerce site, which currently is through Volusion. We're looking at jumping ship to Bigcommerce, but one of our other needs is an inventory management system that would track inventory both through square and through our site (we currently take online payments through paypal pro). 

Right now I'm looking at Shopventory, who don't have Bigcommerce support yet but say they will in coming months. Stitch Labs does have Bigcommerce support but I don't think we want to go with them. Anyone have experience with any of these? Pros, cons? Are there others I should be looking at?",23,9,2015-05-01,ECOM,0.03155684843659401,0.9351937174797058,0.03324942663311958
ecommerce,"Suggestions, please: Lots of products, easy to use.","I'm helping a friend of mine out with an ecommerce site on Volusion. It's terribly clunky, ugly, and adding products &amp; options is a pain, so we're thinking about switching carts. He's got a couple of sites, some with 30k items, but we're going to try this on a 2k item site to see how it goes. 

My two biggest requirements are: 
- Easy to use. Volusion is too much cart. I need something that's a little simpler on the back end.
- Scalable. It should work as well on the tinier sites as it does on the main monster.

ecommerce,New here... I'm looking for a hassle-free payments processor/shopping cart. My brain is mushed... Please help.,"I don't even know where to start to explain my woes, but basically, I want a simple hosted solution.  The payment processor can be the host or I can purchase separate hosting.  ...I think.  

I've looked at these so far:

-**Shopify**, only accepts credit card as payment, so No.

-**WooCommerce**, looks like it could work for the long run, but seeing that I have no clue how to build a simple website, it's currently a No.

-**WP eCommerce plugin**, can probably figure it out, but, again, no web building skills, needs hosting?

-**Prestashop**, looks like I could wrap my brain around it eventually. But I think I need separate hosting.

-**Ecwid**, I built a shop easily.  Prices seem on point.  Have an interview scheduled Monday.  Still think I need separate hosting.

-**Stripe**, successes?  complaints...?  

-**Selz**, looks new, although looks like it could work.

-**3dCart**, looks promising, do I still need separate hosting?

-**BitPay**, definitely going to add this to the shopping cart I choose.

----

Now, that being noted, let me explain what I would like to see my website accomplish:

-I need to list 5, maybe 10 products maximum.

-I would like to be able to accept Credit/Debit Cards, Bitcoin, and Amazon Payments.

-The maximum price on any product will not exceed $20.

-I would like to be able to offer coupons.

I'm sure there's more, but I just want to get my site up for the world to view and hopefully purchase some products from me.

**TL;DR**  There are too many payment processors for me to understand which one fits my business plan.  I need help.

**UPDATE:**  For those interested, I have chosen to go with Stripe/Ecwid as my payment processor/shopping cart.  I have been in contact with a childhood friend who now works in the webdev industry and has helped build many major corporate websites for the outdoor gear industry, and he gave my rough draft site a run through and says everything is smooth, legit, and PCI compliant.  So, at least I got that going for me.  Once I launch the final copy, I will update again.

From my personal experience with my first online store (not a blog post!),"I think doing good off-page SEO for eCommerce is a lot like doing a good off-page SEO for any other type of website. It mostly comes down to being good at link building.
--
I’m going to share with you some great tactics that worked pretty well for my first online store, and you can start applying them right now.

I’ll start with the easiest ones and progress to some harder methods. As you could expect, the difficult ones are where the real SEO juice is, but it doesn’t hurt to do the quick ones, too.

---

**Start by creating an Excel or Google Spreadsheet (I prefer Google if I have to collaborate with colleagues). Name it ""Link building campaign"" or something similar.**

This spreadsheet is going to be your quant-based off-page SEO campaign overview and will aim to give you a bird view of how well you’re doing. 

Add the following columns in the spreadsheet:

* **Website** - the website you want to position a link on
* **Contacted** - Yes/No; if you need to contact a person to request a link on their site
* **Replied** - Yes/No. Shows if the person has replied to your email.
* **Linking** - Yes/No. If the link has been positioned yet.
* **Contact details** - person’s details for contact if needed.
* **Asset type** - what you are going to give them in return. The asset is the benefit you offer them. With online stores this could be: A free product. A discount code for their site readers. The “thought leader” tactic - the online store owner shares a relevant experience with the audience.
* **Article Name** - your article submission for the website if applicable. Applies if you are doing guest-authoring.
Audience - what’s the audience of the website.
* **Most used keywords** - what are the most used keywords on the site. A column with a keyword overview of the site. It gives you a starting point for idea generation if you are going to write an article on the site. You can use this tool to scrap most used words on a page - http://www.online-utility.org/text/frequent_words.jsp
* **Backlinks** - what other sites are linking to the site where you want your link positioned
* **PR** - page rank
* **PA** - page authority
* **DA** - domain authority. For PA and DA use MozBar free plugin.

You can go even further and some marketing analytical stats like:

* **Traffic** - traffic that came from that particular link
* **Conversion rate** - % of successful purchases made by visitors that came from that link 
* **Number of purchases** that a visitor who came from the link made.

This quantitative data will be very helpful to track your off-page SEO campaign. 

[That's how my Link Building Campaign Spreadsheet looked for my first online store.](http://f.cl.ly/items/2M1x131I1V422x1w3d1f/Screen%20Shot%202015-05-06%20at%2010.51.30.png)

**Now:**

Once you get this done, we can get to the fun stuff that is link building.

You can apply some or most of the techniques I list here. Personally I had best results with guest-blogging and discount/product giveaway to bloggers.

#1. Put a link to your online store in your forum profile signature to get some quick links and traffic.

Most message boards use “no-follow” links that don’t bring any SEO juice. They are still worth for the traffic that comes from them. 

You can get 5-10 links that way fast.

#2. Ask for opinion for your store on message boards or sub reddits

Open a new topic and asks what users think of your online store design, usability, product selection, prices, etc. You don’t want to come out too promotional.

That's how I got my first customer for my online store for novelty gadgets and men’s gifts. I posted a “Let me know what you think of my online store” thread in a web developers’ forum. Is all about targeting the right websites.

#3. Submit your online store to business directories.

These links don’t have the greatest SEO profile you’d like, but there’s no reason not to do them. You might try a service like RankCrew or do some manual link submissions. 

*Be careful:*
Don’t submit more than three links per day! With the Penguin algorithm, you might get penalized for that.

#4. If your store has a fancy design, don’t underestimate the web design galleries.**

Submit your link to a service like http://thecssgallerylist.com/. I had great results with my personal portfolio, and we got more than 1700 views on our first day that came from web design galleries. It can work with an online store if you store has some impressive design and product photography.

#5. Share your link on marketplaces

If you sell products on eBay, Etsy and other marketplaces you can include a link to your store in your profile or where acceptable in your product description.

#6. Product and discount giveaway.

With product discounts and giveaways, I had greatest results.

With an online store, you have one great advantage, and that is physical products bought on the cheap. 

Find authoritative blogs in your niche with a big readers audience. You can track backlinks to your competitors and see what bloggers and sites link to them. To do that use a service like Ahrefs and Open Seo Stats, the former one being free.
Send an email to the blog owner that you’d like to offer a discount for his/hers readers and send them a neat gift.

With my geek gadgets stores, I approached game bloggers, sci-fi enthusiasts, and other nerdy folks. Here’s a template of the email I use.

&gt;Hi there,

&gt;I’m Kaloyan, co-founder of a new website for unusual gadgets and all other geeky things -  mengear.bg

&gt;I’m approaching you because I found out that you like the stuff we have. We do have some cool gadgets; it would be awesome if you could check them. As you are a person that's deep into that subculture, it will be useful for us if you have 2 minutes to check our site.  Share your opinion about the products we list and the site in general.

&gt;Apart from that I'd like to make a small discount for you and your blog’s readers as we believe they’ll enjoy the stuff we offer. Here’s a discount code for 10% OFF: “discountcode”.

&gt;Last but not least I’d like you to give us an address where we can send a small gift we’ve prepared for you. We think you’ll like it :)

&gt;Best Regards,
&gt;Kalo


He got back to us quickly. Later we sent him an excellent 8-bit glasses with a personalized geeky message:

**[Check here!](http://cl.ly/image/1F1y0I2a2y3H/Screen%20Shot%202015-05-06%20at%2011.43.40.png)**

We got more than a 1000 views from his site and a link from a PR4 targeted page. Everything costing us: less than 5 quid. 

#7.  Guest-blogging

This tactic involves approaching bloggers and online magazines with some great content. A natural fit are entrepreneurial and marketing blogs. Try to find the blog owner or chief editor’s email and ask him/her that you are currently writing an in-depth article about X. 
And you believe his/her readers will find beneficial. 

It’s easy to write something about eCommerce - share what worked and what didn’t for your store. Again don’t be promotional. The point here is to share insightful content. In the “about the author” section you’ll share a link to your store.

Hope this advice helps you get started with doing some strong off-page link building for your store.

dropship,"New to dropshipping, open questions","Hi there,

I'm new to dropshipping, and I wanted to make sure that I have all my eggs in the right baskets before I take the plunge.

**Current Understanding**

I am in the process of populating out my ecommerce website to contain the inventory of the distributor I am selling through. I list all of their products out at MAP and get a percentage of the profit that my distributor and I deem fit. 

Once I sell an item, I forward that sale through to my distributor who then packs it up and ships it to the customer.

**Question:** How do I process customer credit/debit cards? Do I talk to my bank and have them give me a terminal? Do I wait to forward my sale to the distributor until I can make sure that the credit/debit card actually runs a successful payment? I am currently using Magento as my ecommerce platform, is there automation software that can process all of this for me?

**Packing Labels:** Where do you get packing labels? Do I go into FedEx and say I need to order 500 packing labels and have them sent to my distributor? Are there any other personal touch kind of features that I should incorporate into the boxes that my distributor ships for me?

**Returns:** How do you process returns as a dropshipper? When the distributor ships the product, do they ship it with the return address as my address? Or do they ship it with the return address as the distributors address? If they ship it with my return address, what am I supposed to do with the product if returned? Do I ship it back to the distributor and ask for a refund? Or is it on me to eat the loss? Or do you avoid all of this by including an open box no return policy?

Thanks in advance for your help! Sorry if these are newbie questions.",2,3,2015-05-06,ECOM,0.03792879357933998,0.9345772862434387,0.027493860572576523

I have a product that I'm initially selling in Canada only, but I figure 50% of my sales potential is to the USA.

**I'm trying to decide if I should price in USD and add a slight buffer for currency fluctuations OR if I should price in CDN and let American customers absorb/take advantage of fluctuations?**

In my eyes here are the primary pros and cons for fixing a USD price:

Pros

* People always know what they're paying

Cons

* My pricing won't be as competitive if I add a buffer to protect myself


For pricing in CDN

Pros

* I can be priced very competitively in times like these

Cons

* Price will fluctuate 


Thoughts?

ecommerce,What's your complete process look like? (cart-&gt;crm-&gt;shipping-&gt;accounting?),"Hi all,

My parents run a very small site, but it's growing and I'm looking to automate as much as possible.

Right now the online cart itself is migrating to Shopify.  However, I'm trying to not get killed on monthly services for the various stages of a sales process since it doesn't make much money yet, so we simply can't justify $200+ monthly for these types of things.

Main questions:

1.  CRM - **what do you suggest using as a free CRM?**  We're not interested in pursuing anything that has a monthly fee right now.  It would be nice to at least have shopify auto-populate another tool rather than copying &amp; pasting.  It will sync with mailchimp, which is kind of cool, though.  (But of course MailChimp isn't really a CRM).  Zoho seems to be a popular free option, but I don't see any shopify integration listed.

2.  Marketing automation/workflow - the currently plan is to use MailChimp for the time being since it's free up to 2000 contacts.  We're at around 1300.

3.  Shipping - right now is just being done manually, not via a fulfillment center, but we're probably getting close to needing it in a couple of years.  What's your favorite way to autogenerate shipping labels and save time &amp; money?

4.  Accounting - right now what they have is really rough - just an excel spreadsheet , or an ancient database software running on an old laptop (like 1982 old).  We have a copy of quickbooks 2009.  I'm aware of freshbooks and quickbooks online, but again, we're trying to avoid monthly recurring costs.

What are the best open-source solutions for CRM and accounting that would work best here?

Basically just looking to improve overall logistics to make things easier to run.",12,7,2015-05-11,ECOM,0.0328005775809288,0.9346586465835571,0.03254082798957825

Things like ground beef are easy as I can package at 1lb  increments, but roasts and steaks will always weigh differently which changes the price of that item.

woocommerce,How to sort/group cart items by custom field?,"For this project, I have a slightly unconventional WC setup. I'm using the WordPress Types plugin to establish parent/child relationships between posts, the last level of which are WooCommerce products.

By default, the WC cart works like anyone would expect - it generates a table with each item in the cart. However, since this project relies heavily on the previously mentioned parent/child structure, I need a way to group all the products in the cart by their parent (accessible via a custom field). Here's an example just to be sure I'm being clear:

 Default layout:

    Product 1
    Product 2
    Product 3
    Product 4
    Product 5
    Product 6

Required layout:

    Parent 1
        Product 1
        Product 2
        Product 3
    Parent 2
        Product 4
        Product 5
        Product 6

Not necessarily in that order, of course.

Basically I just need to be able to access each product's parent custom field, then use that to delegate the products into separate groups.

This needs to be an extendable solution, since I'll also need the same layout on the checkout page, order history, and pretty much anywhere else a list of chosen products appears.

Thanks so much for any help you guys can provide.",5,2,2015-05-11,ECOM,0.031640127301216125,0.9360284209251404,0.032331451773643494
shopify,Cheapest CRM option with shopify? (preferably no monthly fee) + accounting?,"Hi all,

I'm migrating my parents' site to Shopify soon, but also wanted to get them into some kind of modern CRM and accounting system.

They have no CRM system right now (well, they use excel, and have an ancient version of ACT that's out of date), and their accounting is awful.

Which CRM systems in 2015 do you think integrate the best with Shopify, and are affordable?  I'd prefer to not pay monthly if possible (or have it be rather cheap).  Are there any integrations for open source ones?  I'm looking for just very basic features - customer info, notes, etc.

Also, what are you using for accounting?  We have a single copy of Quickbooks 2009 that's not in use, but it wouldn't easily integrate I don't think.  I'm aware of freshbooks, but really don't want to add recurring costs since this is a very small business still.

ecommerce,"Looking to re-launch a failing ecommerce site, what do you think of this setup?","I've recently partnered with a friend to relaunch his GoDaddy hosted ecommerce site that is currently getting zero traffic. I've done some frontend/backend web dev recently, but haven't touched ecommerce in years. Looking to get my hands dirty on the dev side, but within reason.

I'd rather avoid a CMS if possible because I have some specific design things I want to do with the site and I don't want to be locked into a template and specific hosting. So, here's what I'm thinking:

**Host**: DigitalOcean - I like the low pricing while we are building traffic and the ability to scale

**Site**: Custom built HTML/CSS mostly on the Boostrap framework

**Shopping Cart**: Ecwid - it looks nicely configurable but I don't see many people talking about it here

**Payment gateway**: Stripe - Don't see any hurdles here.

The biggest question for me is ecwid. I really dont want to reinvent the wheel and build my own shopping cart, but I also need it to fit my site nicely. I like the pricing model and the social integration. Plus, we currently have less than 10 products and should be able to afford a higher priced option when we are ready to scale. I see Magento is more popular here though, any compelling reasons why?

Appreciate any feedback, thank you!",13,7,2015-05-12,ECOM,0.03092813491821289,0.931352972984314,0.03771885111927986
ecommerce,New custom designed Magento store... No orders,"So I launched my new ecommerce site last week, gathered feedback from friends, family and anyone else who would listen before I started advertising my site.

I'm using Google Shopping for my PPC campaign whilst buildling out a blog for SEO. SEO is obviously going on outwith the site too.

So far, from 25 clicks in Google Shopping in the past 2 days we've had zero sales. Now, I realise the sample isn't that high but I'm concerned that we've only had one person even make it to the checkout.

Is there anything in my buying process that stands out as an annoying feature? I'm concerned that the checkout page isn't clear that you can continue without creating an account or logging in. I'm also concerned about our pop-up when you add an item to your basket. The idea was that people would buy extra items but does the up-sell actually put people off?

dropship,Some Questions; Tipping Point,"Going to give some basic info before asking questions; 

-Found a Niche that seems to be growing/trending quite a bit however each order would more than likely avg &lt; $25. 
-I found a distributor that has a ""turn key"" type site they can supply me with that I can edit accordingly 
-For an extra $500 they will auto-update the inventory they have on file daily on the site if I used the turn key site
-Apparently ""no fees"" - Says no shipping fees, no minimums, etc
(Distribution Center also looks to be a bit of a smaller one with only about 150k products available but does require me to go through the same process of filling out an application etc.)
-Looking to make some side income that is partially passive because the beauty of drop shipping is, you dont have to physically be anywhere.

Question #1:  After doing some research I see that a majority of these items are listed on Amazon already however they are clearly upsold to handle the extra fee Amazon charges.  Would it be even worth it to sell items at such a low cost that yes, I will make 20-25% margin on but it would have to be such high volume to make any real money.  Guess this is more opinion or suggestion really to people in the business

Question #2:  Has anyone heard of a company that doesnt charge shipping fees or no fees at all with no mins?  I thought that was strange.  Did I hit like a golden goose type place or something?

Question #3: Would you use a ""turn key"" site?

Question #4:  Would it be worth the extra $500 to get the inventory management system in place?  Is this a valuable asset to have once your rolling on a daily basis?

Question #5:  How do I handle a dropshipping businesses part time?  (In Question 6 you see my work schedule)  Lets say, I cant do any of this work till 6PM every night and on the weekends.  Will this hinder me being able to run this business?

Question #6:  I am 60/40 right now on deciding to move forward with this venture.  I work a full-time job already where I am from 7:30AM to 4:30PM M-F but have the weekends free and nights free.  What would be the top 3 things you would say to someone in my position.

Question #7:  Can I outsource a VA to practically handle my customer service?  If so, how would I even go about trying to train/inform somehow how to do that?

The shop sells bags and accessories, so it would either need to be a very generic review platform, or one aimed at fashion and/or crafts.

The demographic is mainly Europe, so it would either need to be aimed at an  international audience, or aimed at Europeans.

Do you know any such services or sites? Do you have any experience with such services?

---
The shop is built in Spree, so I could easily integrate a review system in the site. But that has several downsides:

* It takes the focus away. Just like I won't build a support-desk into the software, but instead use something like Zendesk, I'd rather not spend time and effort on something that is not the core business.
* It makes the shop (technically and UX-wise) more complex.
* I'd rather have the (overwhelmingly) positive reactions of people ""out there"", instead of ""hidden away"" on this site. I'd like to use such a service for discoverability too. 

Edit, removed the link, as I don't know if this violates the rules.",2,4,2015-05-14,ECOM,0.028525134548544884,0.9371862411499023,0.03428855538368225

I've done basic websites and some easy WooCommerce and Big Commerce sites but I've never done anything like Magento. They have a developer that can connect Magento sites with BlueCherry (the software that manages inventory and other things). That's the reason Magento is being used.

Basically, I am in charge of figuring out how to get Magento going. I found some templates and it says they can install the templates as well (templatemonster.com). These would probably work for what we're looking for to begin with. I have been told it's best to host a magento site on a dedicated server. If anyone has any info on this, and good places to host magento sites that would be awesome. I know that to install it there's some stuff you need to do with Mysql? I don't know much about that at all. I'm assuming that the people who install it will take care of that. Is there anything I need to know about this for when I'm looking for a hosting site?

I'm starting up an online shop and just finished coding my site. I'm now looking for a way to hook up shopping functionality. I just took a look at shopify and realized they don't allow you to upload your own files, just themes. 

Is there some way for me to get my main files hosted by an eCommerce platform and have a checkout page/ other shop pages run through them? I want the security of having a platform handle the ordering but I don't want to be forced to use a theme and not be allowed to touch the html/php.

I'm probably not explaining this in the best way but I hope it's understandable. It's vital for me to be able to keep my site because it revolves around a product customizer that is already coded. It allows the user to pick colors/designs and then sends that info to another page to process their order. This is where I would need to incorporate some sort of eCommerce features.

* Google Shopping/Merchant Center data feed 

* Front end customization: Hiding quantity when it's not needed on bundle items

* Amazon inventory connection to Magento - so we don't have to independently manage two inventories

* Add a new shipping option: International Express - $44.95 -  not guaranteed (est. 1-2 weeks)

* Cart link in header - bring back the default hover flyout from our theme

* Create coupon code that makes standard shipping free

* Front end customization: 'add to cart' button on the category page and homepage should open the theme's ""quickview"" of the product

I think it's a great idea for many reasons including 1) recurring customers as the product is a consumable 2) I have a good idea for an innovative product 3) dry food can stay 4) health + wellness is hot and easy to market. 

I'm sure I'll run into many obstacles, but the one I'm currently dealing with is how to MVP this product without buying in bulk.  I'm planning to do everything from design of the mix + design of the packages + everything on the web + shipping etc. However, what is the cheapest way to acquire 500 12oz bags to test the market? I'd do it in my garage if I could, but I believe there are restrictions in regard to that. 

Currently, I think my best bet is to find a 'packaging' company that is approved to package food, give them the raw mix + bags and have them seal it. 

If you've done trail mix ecommerce (or something like it) before and I'm overlooking its difficulty + low-margins, would also appreciate a heads-up.

ecommerce,Utility Of Filters In Ecommerce In Daily Life,"Filters in ecommerce includes product specifications like RAM, operating system, and screen size, along with other important factors for customers such as price and free delivery. The additional ability to filter by reviews can also be useful if you have no fixed idea of the laptop you want.
 
It is also important that the filters in ecommerce be added and removed easily so customers can browse by different combinations and patterns of features. Filters should be removed with one click, and the results should be updated instantly. Customers will arrive at an e-commerce site with a clear idea of what they want, more will prefer to browse, so it is important to accommodate this user behavior and make browsing for products as easy as possible and with utmost convenience.

Also Read: How To Design An Effective Ecommerce Landing Page
On both ecommerce and shopping sites, users can find products in two different ways: searching and browsing. Searching obviously means using the site search whereas browsing involves drilling down and searching through the categories provided by the website.

Regardless of which method is used, users will be presented with a product listing from which to find the product they want. This product listing can contain tens, hundreds or even thousands of products, so finding the right product from this list can be a difficult or even impossible task on any ecommerce site.

A few tips for effective filtered navigation:

1) Make it easy to add and remove filters in ecommerce
Customers may add too many filters and end up with too few results. Making it easy to add and remove filters with one click as on the Comet’s website means that customers can easily refine their searches.

2) Refresh the page quickly
Use Of Filters In Ecommerce

Though I liked the filter options on Hotels.com, having to wait five seconds or more for the results to be updated can become frustrating. Making it as fast to load and user-friendly as possible will mean more customers will take the time to search.

3) Avoid returning no results
This can also be frustrating for a shopper. So don’t allow customers to filter to the point where no relevant products are returned.

4) Present the customer with meaningful filtering options
Filters in ecommerce should be things that customers typically look for from the products in question. Do not just present data because it happens to be available for a product.

5) Make the filtering options suit the product
Filters in ecommerce, by color, makes perfect sense when looking for shoes, shirts or home furniture and accessories, but is less useful for TVs or laptops.
UTILITY
1) Providing effective and relevant filtered navigation can make a huge difference to the customer experience. It reduces the amount of cognitive effort required of visitors, and makes it more likely that they will find a product that suits them. It adds on to the convenience of customers in all ways.

2) Only a small proportion of shoppers will arrive at an ecommerce site knowing the exact product they’re looking for, while most will prefer to browse and consider different options. As such, sites need to give shoppers tools to search their product range and remove the items they’re not interested in.

3) Most sites have filters for size and color, but it can be useful to think of unique filters that are specific to your audience or product type. Effective filters can be of a great help in all ways for solving problems.

4) Getting filters in ecommerce right improves the probability of being found and allows users to find the product they want in less time, from this product listing. If users can’t find the exact product they require in the minimal time, there’s a good chance they’ll go to an ecommerce site where they can.",0,1,2015-05-20,ECOM,0.08097245544195175,0.8922814130783081,0.02674611285328865

By way of background, I'm currently using Amazon Webstore (AW) with all orders fulfilled by FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) which works well for me as I run a very lean operation and AW supports that by automatically fulfilling FBA orders that come in from [bootbutler.com](http://www.bootbutler.com) (my website) as well as amazon.com without the need for any user intervention.

Do any of you know of a way to use Shopify with FBA and have orders automatically processed like I described above?

I looked into Shipstation, and unfortunately, their software requires that a user log in regularly to ""process"" new orders, which is both unnecessary busy work, and it's bad for customers since it unnecessarily delays shipping (unless you login and process every hour, 24/7) and makes the process dependant on people with all the inconsistency that entails ...

dropship,Does Dropshipping Still Work?,"Yes. Does it still work now in 2015? Yes. Will it still work 2 years from now? Yes.

In fact, I've come to the conclusion that if you can't follow directions, and put in the work necessary to get your store up and running and make at least $1,000 a month from it, then you probably wouldn't have done very well in any other online business either.

I used to believe the negativity of pessimists online saying that dropshipping is harder now or that all the good niches are taken, but at the same time, I meet people every week who had just started and is successful, and I just started a new niche with my girlfriend a few months ago that is doing extremely well.  

So 100% honestly, if you don't think dropshipping will work, and you aren't willing to put in the work, it won't work for you. 

My advice: 

1. Stop looking for shortcuts. 
2. Don't use directories. 
3. Don't dropship on eBay or Amazon. 
4. Put in the time to learn the business model.  Take a class, enroll in a course, do an internship, or read a book.

ecommerce,Crazy customer stories...,"I once had a customer who I instantly could tell was a little… ‘off’. He kept emailing and asking me questions. I sell tech type products, so that’s not unusual… and I’m more than happy to help. But this guy would ask incredibly basic questions, and then when he ran out of new questions, he would start back with the old ones all over again. He gave me a sob story about how he was a vet, and had a “disability”… He had to rely on other people to help him set stuff up, and he didn’t have much money. Well… This was one of the few times I did something like this… I sent him a $45 accessory for free, so he could use the main product correctly.

So after a dozen emails back and forth, he gets the item. Murphy’s law… We left one of the part’s out. We NEVER do this, but of course… Of all people it had to happen to, it was this guy. So he actually calls me and leaves this panicked message about it missing the part, as if we’re just going to stiff him. I send him an email back, saying; sorry… it’s on it’s way.

He sets up the product… He of course claims it doesn’t work. I could have bet money that one was coming. I knew it did work, but he was doing something wrong. This now starts a massive exchange back and forth with him over weeks, trying to get this item to work. He starts losing his patience and tells me that he thinks we deliberately sent him a bad one, to make up for the free item I included. Unbelievable. So I tell him that I have had enough, and just send everything back and I’ll refund… He refuses and says he wants another one. Finally I somehow managed to get him to set it up right, and it worked. About 6 months later, he emails me again… He says his garage collapsed and destroyed the item. Huh? lol I lied and said we didn’t have anymore. Sorry, I’m not putting myself through that again. I counted the emails and it seriously totaled like, 60 or something. No BS. How many companies would do that?

So yeah… What’s the old saying? No good deed goes unpunished.",5,5,2015-05-26,ECOM,0.13100603222846985,0.8324409127235413,0.0365530289709568

ecommerce,Need help selecting a platform for non-traditional ecommerce site...,"Hi,


I am posting here because I don’t exactly know where to go to get the answers I need on developing a bit of a non-traditional webstore – I tried to keep this short, but it turned into a bit of a beast…so my sincerest apologies and appreciation. 

&amp;nbsp;



A quick backstory…
I’m an architect, relatively tech saavy, but not in the webdev or ecommerce world (so forgive any newbie verbage and/or stupidity). I would like to build a website to match products &amp; manufacturers with designers.  The Architecture industry while pretty technologically advanced on the day to day work end, is horribly antiquated on the product specification end… 

&amp;nbsp;


Anyways, I need to figure out how to develop a site that functions somewhat like an ecommerce site and somewhat like a directory site.  This is the problem… it doesn’t seem like any of the platforms I’ve been researching will exactly fit my need, and let me try and build a functioning, beautiful, scalable site with little capital and doing as much as I can myself.  The idea is to have a one stop shop for all manufacturers in a certain niche to display together.  i.e. I want to buy a light fixture… I can search or browse for ‘light fixture’ and be able to browse through images of products from multiple manufacturers, click the image to get to a manufacturer page with company info, links, downloads, etc - but NOT sell product, just link to manufacturers.  I have thought that this basically could function on any ecommerce platform and just not list prices, but all of the other stuff I hope to add to the site shows the limitations with ecommerce…  Directory platforms I’ve looked into don’t look that great visually (as a designer, the aesthetics of the site are vital) and don’t serve the ‘webstore’ product interface. 

&amp;nbsp;


I’ve looked into shopify, bigcommerce, ecommerce, brilliantdirectory, edirectory, magento, volusion, etc…. It seems like an unending sea of options, so rather than be secretive about the idea and take the wrong direction… I need some help from those who know more than I…

&amp;nbsp;


What I need a site to do:

&amp;nbsp;


**Kick ass, simple, beautiful landing page…**

- Imagery rich, featured products, search, about, navigation, article, etc.  pretty simple and straightforward.

&amp;nbsp;


**Basic, but non-traditional ‘ecommerce’ format**

- Displays products and info, but no prices or purchases – very imagery heavy… preferably a slick mosaic image display instead of typical product grid and text displays.
- Search, browse by category, etc… pretty straightforward

&amp;nbsp;


**Manufacturer info pages**

- Kind of a mini – webstore, similar to if you clicked a ‘see all XYZ company products’ on any other store. again, no prices
- Local links to retailers and / or sales reps
- Galleries, links, info

&amp;nbsp;


**Back end**

- Manufacturer / account login
- Manufacturers can post, edit, upload their own data and images to display on the site.  For me, this will mitigate the tedium of data input and management.
- I’d like this page to automate billing for the manufacturers.  (They pay to be listed on the site.)  Here they can see their invoices, monthly billing, as well as selecting their preferred payment details.
- Average user login - Can have ‘favorited’ products, manufacturers, personal profile, etc.

&amp;nbsp;


**Misc.**

- Community page, links, articles, local firm listings, job listings, etc.

&amp;nbsp;


Bottom line… I have a very clear idea of the look, feel, and function I’d like to see, just not the right place to start.  I also understand that I will not likely be able to implement a fully functional ‘perfect’ vision at the outset.  I’m okay with that, but I do need a platform that will grow with me.  I’d also like to automate as much as humanly possible from the outset.  A kid, wife, and full time job don’t give me a ton of extra time for data entry – I need to focus on sales and marketing.  Lastly, I also understand that I may be in over my head and need some actual help… we’ll see.

&amp;nbsp;


Dang.  Long post… so sorry.  My sincerest thanks for taking any time you can on helping a guy build his muse…

shopify,Can someone clarify how to use Google Apps for Work (mail) with Shopify?,"Hi all,

I'm looking to migrate a website from a small shared web host to Shopify, but am a bit confused on MX servers. I plan to move use email via Google Apps for Work.

Now, my main confusion is this:
In the past, the MX servers were configured at the web host, and not the domain provider (namesilo/godaddy/etc). Why is it done there, and not at the domain level?

For example, when I move to Shopify, they have no control panel to change MX settings there, only some redirects.

Once I make the move the DNS nameservers on NameSilo will obviously have to point to Shopify, but can I also change MX servers somehow there, rather than at the host?  NameSilo made it sound like any MX changes wouldn't work if you don't use their own nameservers.

ecommerce,What does your customer service email look like? (forwarding/orders@/support@/etc),"Hi all,

I'm setting up Google Apps for work for an ecommerce site, and am deciding how to best handle all of the emails.

Mail comes in from 2 main sources:

1.  Orders placed via the website
2.  Customer information from the contact page

Email needs to come out from:

3.  A from address for marketing emails
4.  A from address for personal emails (from Mike@domain or Bob@domain)
5.  A from address for receipt emails from orders

Users:  3 employees.  

I'm thinking about using these addresses:

- UserA@domain.com
- UserB@domain.com
- UserC@domain.com
- info@domain.com (or similar)

Setup:

- Have info@domain.com forward to all user accounts above
- Any user can reply to any order or inquiry
- Both order notification and customer questions come in to info@

Downside:  any bulk mailing means that users will be bombarded by a bunch of out-of-office / bounce / etc type replies.

ecommerce,Mobility in E-commerce Business,"Internet is king. Anyone who does not believe in it, is being foolish and hind-sighted. So while the internet is ruling the world, the use of technology for your business has become completely inevitable. So then, how much are you using the latest in tech for your business? Have you gone mobile yet? If not, here’s why you must!

Online shopping, once considered insecure and unsafe, has become key. It is the most convenient option, and helps people purchase things they want and need from the comforts of their homes. Everyone globally has moved to e-shopping and m-shopping, like never before.

The mobile shopping experience has further enhanced this user experience and convenience. And hence, this massive shift is something all companies should worry about and work on. Business owners, who took long enough to go online, beware. You do not have that much time to go mobile. With smartphones having taken over most of the mobile phone industry, and with people having become too dependent on their gadgets, the shops that aren’t on mobile apps will soon lose out to those have made their way into the market.

If you do not want to take our word for it, it is fine. But you want to take theirs:

·         Joel Anderson, CEO of Walmart

“I can’t overstate how mobile is changing how we interact with our customers. We have to embrace these changes.”

·         Hil Davis, Co-Founder of J. Hilburn

“E-commerce and mobile commerce have dramatically changed the way brands reach customers, making it faster and easier for consumers to make purchases on the fly while avoiding the hassles of going to the store.”

·         Miles Lee

“M-commerce remains attractive because of the fact that people carry their mobile phones with them at all times.”

Now are you convinced? If not we can share some of the benefits too.

1.       Daily deals play on the psychology of consumers

Daily or regular deals earn you more money as most of these are generated based on his/her shopping wish-lists,browsing history, etc.

2.       Coupons are a sure lure

Online and mobile shops are a one-time investment. The cost of building, managing, and maintaining them are much smaller than that of the real store. The budget for the interiors and decor, electricity, staff salaries, staff uniforms, incentives, and everything else in real stores is many notches higher than for an e-commerce or m-commerce store. In this scenario, distributing discount coupons are the most effective way to build your customer base.

3.       Secure payment gateways – the nail to the coffin

Gone are the days when consumers were worried about the lack of the online safety and security of bank details. Now, thanks to more secure payment gateways, the shopper is no longer worried about his money being at stake. And remember, the moment the customer feels safe about his cash and account details, retail shopping loses any importance that may be left.

4.       Mobility in the banking sectors have enhanced this confidence

The last thing, thanks to hackers, your parents and others from the yesteryear would have done on the mobile, is banking. But banking apps made money-related online jazz, totally secure.Banking was one of the foremost sectors that taught our generation the effective way to use internet for payment transactions, both locally and globally likewise. This has reduced bank visits by a great percentage, and made transactions, payments, withdrawals, and every other activity a cake walk.

So…

Stop denying the fact that mobiles have become an inevitable and integral part of shopping, and is only about to increase by the day. Take inspiration from Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon who says, “If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful”, get going.

dropship,Why Drop Shipping is Dead (for new players),"From doing my own research, I have come to the conclusion that unless you were an established player from a few years ago, this is a bad business model for you. Below are my reasons as to why:

1. Amazon continues to get bigger and continues to steal organic traffic searches from Google on the shopping end. 

2. Niches are tapped out. Again unless you are already established, it is very difficult to find an unexplored niche. It can happen but unlikely. And even if you successfully find a niche, expect a bunch of other players invading your market, especially considering how easy it is to create a dropshipping business in respect to capital requirements. 

3. Wholesalers/manufactures are becoming smarter. Drop shipping was so good back several years ago because businesses still didn't understand e-commerce. Now you have wholesalers who revamped their websites and using money on ads. This applies to some industries more than others. 

4. Margins continue to get compressed with heightened competition

Drop shipping seems to be a business model that doesn't work for new players anymore. It can still work if you find an untapped niche, but you'll eventually find yourself with competitors and then it becomes almost a price war to the bottom. 

Unless you can add some enormous value to a niche (which is unlikely in itself), you don't have a shot at an existing niche. Alternatively, I suggest looking at Amazon FBA if you wanted to get your feet wet with e-commerce.",7,11,2015-05-31,ECOM,0.0727228969335556,0.8908466696739197,0.03643038123846054
