ecommerce,Which e-commerce site should I use?,"Apologies if this isn't the right place; let me know and I'll post elsewhere.

Basically, I want to start selling things online, in a more independant fashion (I currently sell via Spamazon). The small amount I can store limits the amount I can sell, therefore I'm looking at a 'lots of little profits' kind of model. The features I need are:

* Free
* Inventory tracking (all five sell? 'Out of stock')
* Design templates (preferably that I can edit) provided
* Special offers/coupons would be useful

By trying to cut out the middleman (Spamazon) like this, I am of course trying to make a little more; but it also means learning about things I didn't need to know about before...

* Payment processors... pros and cons of PayPal, Google Wallet, etc...?
* ""SEO""...?

I have found [one site](http://www.freewebstore.org/website/features.html) that appears to fit the bill, but comments and suggestions regarding any potential site are more than welcome. Please help if you can :)

*edit follows*

It should also be noted that both my stock and I are in the UK, if that makes a difference...?

*another edit follows*

Does anyone have any ideas of how I could promote my store? A cool guerilla marketing technique, for example - it would be especially cool if it was something I could also apply to Spamazon while I'm still using it.",46,11,2013-06-04,ECOM,0.024691492319107056,0.9345511794090271,0.04075730964541435

ecommerce,"Manual, accurate &amp; current verification of name/address/phone for non-US orders?","I receive many credit card orders in my ecommerce business, and I manually review the ones that are flagged by my automated system, to decide whether I think they are at high risk of being fraudulent. To do this, I enlist many online services, mostly free, and some paid. Examples include Google searches, Spokeo, Pipl, and some paid services that I won't name. For US orders, this is quite easy, as I have access to powerful search tools that help me keep my domestic fraud very close to zero. But for international orders, it is much more challenging.

I am wondering whether there are services that will allow me to search and verify name/address/phone data for any *non-US countries*, **drawing from accurate, up to date databases**. This is essential for me, as AVS and CVV don't prevent many of the forms of fraud that I encounter. I am looking for tools that allow me to input various combinations of address/name/phone data, mostly because I need to verify whether people actually *currently* live in the address(es) provided on their orders.

To get a clear idea of what I mean, think about (or visit and try out) www.spokeo.com *edit: for some reason it seems that the formatting for a link isn't working - sorry about that*. I am looking for the same basic functionality, but for non-US countries and with more accurate and current data. Spokeo's database is pretty terrible for address and phone data, for a variety of reasons. I also don't need email/username searches, only address/name/phone.

I know of 192.com for UK, and I have not used paid versions of it because it has gotten incredibly bad reviews, but it seems like their database might be fairly accurate and up-to-date. Any opinions on this site?

I would also particularly be interested in similar services for: Australia, Canada, most countries in Europe, Hong Kong, Mexico, and any country in South America.

Any recommendations? Thanks for your help Reddit!",5,1,2013-06-06,ECOM,0.06247140094637871,0.914569616317749,0.022959008812904358

dropship,What kind of fees do drop shippers charge and how can you avoid it?,"Dropshipping is the easiest way to make money online .But if you start dropshipping without understanding a company properly , you may fall in problem. One can easily start dropshipping without any inventory. But some dropshippers will charge you in different ways. So you can not make profit with these company which will charge you for per order fees, monthly fees and purchasing minimums and . But if you can run your dropshipping business without any charge, so why do you bear such kinds of charge.

Per Order Fee: some dropshippers will charge per order fees. They usually charge a per-order fee to cover the expense involved with packaging and shipping an individual product. These fees are usually in the $2 to $5 range, or it can be larger. But question is that why do you bear the fees? This kinds of fees will lessen your profit. For example , if a product wholesale price is 50$ and it’s retail price is 60$, then your profit 10$ .But if you bear 5$ for packaging or shipping,then your profit will be lessen and that is 5$. Finally you have made loss working in such a company which does not bear packaging and shipping cost that means per order fee.

It will bear packaging and shipping cost and your customer will get the products directly. Once you have sold a product collect your payment.

Monthly Fees:  Some “drop shippers” may try to charge you an ongoing monthly fee for the privilege of doing business with them.

Purchasing Minimums: Some drop shippers may require a minimum purchase size, either for your first order or on a monthly basis. If you don’t meet these sales threshold, they’ll charge you a fee. So you must be careful about this company. But in the Letusdropship.com , there is not any minimum order quantity .It can be big or small. It will supply products to your customer directly.

dropship,New Supplier Directory/Network For Home &amp; Gift,"Hello, I recently launched a company called MerchantFuse, which is a network that connects retail and wholesale in home and gift.  It is free to join for retailers.

I am aware of the reddiquette around self promotions, so I sent a message to the moderator of this subreddit but I have not heard anything back.  I also noticed this in under the FAQ section ""There are a lot of places that want to sell directories and listings... None are recommended at this point."" I agree that there are a lot of crappy resources out there, and I really do hope to change that with my company.  

Here is a copy of the message that I sent to the mod:

Hello,
I recently launched a company that I think would be of interest to readers of /r/dropship, but I do not want to break the spamming rules. I thought I would check with you before posting anything.

My company is called MerchantFuse, it's a network that connects retail and wholesale in home, housewares, and gift. We help retailers find products and suppliers. We launched 6 months ago and have 550+ wholesalers and 250+ retailers participating so far, and it is free to join for retailers.

You can read more about us in this recent press: www.internetretailer.com/2013/03/20/merchantfuse-launches-b2b-home-furnishings-portal www.launchgrowjoy.com/connect-with-buyers-on-merchant-fuse/

And you can also preview profiles on our site without being logged in: Retailer profile: http://merchantfuse.com/uncommongoods Wholesale profile: http://merchantfuse.com/BlackandBlum

I wonder if there is a way to get some information out about this to some of the redditors in /r/dropship?

ecommerce,Does a lower-cost cart like this exist?,"This is probably dumb to ask, but I was wondering if anyone knew of an ecommerce cart that has simliar features as [eproShop](http://www.epro.com.pl/)? (all in Polish, sorry) Epro is very nice, and of course very nice comes with a cost, a cost too steep for me. I've looked at some of the ones that have been posted on here before, but I didn't really see everything I wanted in the demos or the websites that run the cart software.        
 [Here is one example of the eproShop in action (again, all Polish).](http://www.angel.pl/odziez-o_c_73_1.html) What I like about this is how in the example, you can search for all the items with certain flags attached to them, the red ""New"", the purple ""Promotion/Special"", and the green ""Sale"". I also like how you can have a custom image as the shopping cart/bag symbol. And I likehow you can organize everything not just by price order, but the way they are displayed on the page, how many items per page, the price range, size, color, and manufacturer. And also how you can list the manufacturer name under the item, in addition to the name and the cost.        
I also like [the layout of the item page.](http://www.angel.pl/odziez-sukienka-figl-174-sukienka-o_l_73_215312619.html) and [another example from a different shop (I also like the shopping cart on the top right, and the ""related/worth a look"" and ""also bought"" item lists at the bottom).](http://www.todler.pl/klocki-lego-city-lego-city-posterunek-policji-7498-o_l_86_1100.html)

Those are the main things I really like, I am willing to sacrifice other stylistic things for a nice item page and search functions like those above.",6,1,2013-06-21,ECOM,0.02155635878443718,0.9420990347862244,0.03634463623166084

ecommerce,Flat Rate Shipping vs Real-Time w/ Free Shipping over $xxx,"When reading our site reviews, one of the biggest complaints we see is high shipping.  We offer UPS Ground rates with free shipping over $150.  I am thinking of switching to a flat rate shipping model ($8) and doing away with the free shipping tier.  We don't have the margins to offer both.  

The way I feel, people expect to pay shipping but UPS Ground rates with the residential surcharge can be quite a sticker shock when they hit the shopping cart.  With a flat rate, we can show the shipping in the header as they shop so there is no 'surprise' when they go to check out.
