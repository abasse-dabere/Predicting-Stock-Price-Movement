ecommerce,Canadian here needs help figuring out web hosting for my business - E-commerce is confusing me.,"My customers will pay in person only, but I would like them to have to sign in to place orders online. 

What type of technologies do I need with my hosting package to allow users to use shopping cart to pick items and make an order. But also force them to sign in with their phone number, email, and home address..before they can place their order.

thanks for the help!",7,2,2011-04-20,ECOM,0.026034634560346603,0.9306309819221497,0.04333436116576195

ecommerce,Questions about Google Checkout,"I hope this is an appropriate subreddit to post this in... I've decided I have too much stuff and I want to donate or sell a lot of things. I've been looking into the tools Google provides for online selling. Does anyone have any experience with Google Checkout or their Store gadget? I just want something fast and preferably free, since I'm not looking to start a whole business or anything. I just want to pawn off some of my stuff at reasonable prices (it's mostly geek stuff, if anyone's wondering... toys, comics, etc.). eBay and Craigslist are just too much hassle since my free time is very limited. I like the idea of tossing together an inventory on a spreadsheet and having Google handle the heavy lifting.  

So, is Google Checkout coupled with the Store gadget a good option for selling off a bunch of miscellaneous odds and ends? Are there better alternatives that are free or at least really cheap? Any insight? I suppose I could just keep doing one-off PayPal transactions but that's going to get old really fast. I appreciate any help.",0,1,2011-04-20,ECOM,0.02038457803428173,0.917164146900177,0.0624513104557991
