ecommerce,Ten mistakes most of the first time ecommerce stores in this subreddit are doing..,"I spent the last day of 2015 analyzing all the “review my store” requests(upto 35+ requests in last 200 posts). After typing in ten different threads I decided to prepare a common post for everyone asking for feedback about the mistakes they are doing.

1) Not defining a) your customer b) your user. [Very imp customer may not be same as user. You need to sell to your customers but your product will be used by users]

2) Not doing in-depth research about your customers and users.

3) Trying hard to sell but not trying to solve a problem for your customers.

4) Not trying unconventional ways to get first 10 or 50 sales.

5) Not trying to be different from other competitors.

6) Not providing customer service as per your target customer expectation.

7) Not describing the product in detail or uploading quality images.

8) Not providing a giveaway’s (might be simple beauty tips every day) to keep the prospective customer hooked up with the store.

9) Not proving your authority over the niche of the products your store is selling.

10) Not having human relationship with the users &amp; customers.

I will explain in depth about any point if some users asks for it. 

P.S : I am intentionally not leaving my contact details or website or blog with every post. If somebody wants to have a discussion with me related to the post, please send me a PM.

woocommerce,Amazon Affiliate + Woo?,"Hi all,

I'm a new Woo user (but not WP). I'm playing around with an idea and am wondering if there is a woo extension or wp plugin that will let me use this type of functionality:

http://getultimatedrones.com/ -- you can add items but when you checkout it takes you to Amazon (not my site but one I found while researching woo commerce).

So basically they are using Amazon affiliates and scraping ASIN data into the site.

Is this a custom extension/plug-in or are there any out there already?

Thanks!

Edit: Viewing source I discovered they might be using WooZone. So would this be the plugin possibly? http://codecanyon.net/item/woozone-amazon-associates-bundle-pack/11240475?s_phrase=commission&amp;s_rank=23",2,3,2016-01-01,ECOM,0.02134031616151333,0.9250438213348389,0.053615909069776535

ecommerce,Weird customer behavior,"Just got an email from a customer after they placed an order. He said the following:

Then, attached to that email was a screenshot of his credit card info that he must have taken as he was checking out. ALL of his credit card info is visible. It's super sketchy and feels like I'm being set up for a lawsuit or something. 

The payment has already been captured. I can issue a refund and opt not to send an email notification. This seems like the best answer, to me, but I just wanted to see what reddit thinks.

Anyone heard of this? Any ideas of what I should do?

ecommerce,Need advice on what to call the services I offer.,"Hello everyone!

I am transitioning into a work from home position after working with a company for a few years in Brooklyn, NY. We've had some big growth as a company but unfortunately my girlfriend's Dad passed away and her and I made a decision to move back to San Diego, CA to be closer to family. Luckily my boss saw my hard work and decided to keep me on the team and is allowing me to keep the job and work from home for a small salary cut.

For employment and tax purposes I am going to create an LLC and was curious if anyone could help me with my job title and services I offer in order to prospect new clients to make up for the loss in salary.

Job description/skills I can offer:

1. EDI consultation/implementation for warehouse/order/invoicing purposes.
2. Logistics, routing/booking for large retailers (TJX, Kohls, Target, etc)
3. Listing creation (Shopify, Squarespace Wordpress, Amazon vendor/seller central, Overstock, WayFair, CommerceHub [buyspace/direct to retailer]). 
4. Product development (content creation, copywriting, etc)
5. Vendor support (communication with vendors for product updates, inventory updates, orders, etc)
6. Marketing campaign creation (amazon, adwords, etailer events)
7. Anything Amazon Seller - FBA management, Order data analysis, long-term storage fee analysis, w/e.
8. Ability to connect products with buyers (I keep very close relationships with tons of buyers).


Anyway, you get the picture. I do a lot of different things here and, as I open up my own business, I'd like to take on a few more clients to help them with these types of things... but I really don't know what to call this type of service- I've seen some people call it Marketing but it isn't really just marketing to me...

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks guys.",2,5,2016-01-02,ECOM,0.0454464890062809,0.9259130358695984,0.028640471398830414

woocommerce,'Virtual (Numbered)' product for pick up issue,"I've set up a shop that now has an issue. It's not super complicated but I can't figure out a better way to do it. 

* We're selling mountain bike permits that can be picked up in 5 different locations. 
*  The permits are in the form of bike boards which are numbered so 1 - 1000
*  There are a couple of variations ie. Student/Pensioner/Standard/Spouse. These all have different prices but the same permit is used for all. 
*  Each location gets a stack of permits 1 - 99 / 100 - 199 etc

The shop works as follows at the moment: 

*  Each of the locations is set up as a product &amp; the bikeboard allocated is then based on the number of sales. So LocationA205 - would be the 204th sale + 1 to get the correct bike board number. 
*  Users can only buy one permit at a time because of system as above
*  The variations for students/pensioner etc has been set up with a plugin that allows us to get details for each permit. Need contact &amp; emergency contact details etc for each.

The problem

*  A number of users have been allocated the same bike board when sales aren't completed immediately. They all pay via credit card so they should be completed but it's not always happening.

ecommerce,2016 Shipping Rate Changes: Adjust Your eCommerce Budgets to Accommodate,"New shipping rate changes are coming in 2016 from the big three major shippers, USPS, UPS and FedEx.

USPS (United States Postal Service)

The most notable changes are coming on January 17, 2016 from USPS. Rates for almost all services will increase and some will be phased out entirely.

Average shipping service prices will rise 9.5%

Priority Mail will increase about 9.8%, its first hike in 3 years. Priority Mail Express will go up an average of 15.6%

First-Class Mail Parcel (First-Class Package Service) rates will increase by about 12.8%, BUT – the weight limit has increased from 12.99 oz. to 15.99 oz., which is good news for sellers with products on the lighter end of the scale. For packages under 8 oz., the rate will be a single flat price.

Parcel Select will now be called Parcel Select Ground and will increase an average of 1.9%.

First Class Package International Service will rise 21.6%.

Priority Mail International goes up 19.2%, while Priority Mail Express International will rise 11.6%.

FedEx

Changes come to FedEx’s services on January 4, 2016. Across the board, their rates for FedEx Ground, Express, Home Delivery and Freight will increase by about 4.9%. The freight shipping rates are for destinations within the US (including Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands), between the US and Canada and the US and Mexico.

UPS

UPS rolls their increases into effect on December 28, 2015. Like their competitor Fed Ex, their rates will also increase 4.9%, with the exception of UPS Air and UPS International, which will rise 5.2%.",0,12,2016-01-04,ECOM,0.044100865721702576,0.842677891254425,0.11322127282619476

-Search Engine Optimization. I went through all the tutorials and videos that they offer and nothing seems to work. This is a big deal for us because without traffic to the site, we cannot sell anything.

-The templates they offer are not very responsive and are hard to work with, and the mobile versions are lacking. 

-Creating a blog through bigcommerce is difficult and it is something I have been trying to incorporate into our store design with no success.

ecommerce,Ecommerce vs. Subscription Box Model: Which would you choose if starting today?,"For you e-commerce store owners/ Amazon FBA sellers, if you were starting again today, would you choose the same ecommerce model or start with a subscription box? I read somewhere that one big benefit of the subscription box model is that it is much easier to forecast revenues months in advance and you can pre-sell, which reduces the risk from ordering large MOQs with your own funds. On the other hand, I heard that it's hard to forecast revenues with a traditional e-commerce setup, but that might not be true if you have a profitable and consistent PPC campaign set up. Also, I assume that the subscription box model is worse off in terms of missing out on Amazon and Adwords traffic opportunities.

ecommerce,Migrate from Prestashop to Shopify Plus or Magento?,"Hi,
Our website is currently running on Prestashop and we are looking to migrate to a more enterprise level ecommerce solution. We have narrowed the choice down to the following in this order:
1. Shopify Plus
2. Customised Magento CE developed by Web Dev company
3. Magento Enterprise

Has anybody any experience with Shopify Plus and have they got feedback on it. I'd be particularly interested in hearing from people who migrated to Shopify Plus from Magento and vice-versa.

We are having the following issues with our current setup: 
- Upgrading Prestashop is painful (incompatible modules).
- Hosting Issues (downtime and managing the server).
- Web Development on Prestashop (upgrades/custom modules etc...). Time delay getting quality developers and work completed.
- Prestashop doesn't have the functionality.

We would prefer to spend our time concentrating on sales and marketing and not dealing with hosting providers, developers, bug finding and trialing modules (no transparency, feedback on modules by previous customers).

Looking forward to getting some feedback from you guys!

ecommerce,Which Framework to use?,"Hey all,
I'm going to be building a E-Commerce store for a client. We're trying to choose a framework, and we figured it would be a good idea if we had user input. 

The store is going to have around 750 products, and we need it to load fast, but we do not have our own server and are on shared Dreamhost hosting.

We are trying to decide between Magento, Shopify, Shopping Cart Elite. I would like to use Magento, personally, since that would give me the most customization options. What do you who use Magento think of it? Would it work well on shared hosting?

We considered Wordpress and Woocommerce, but I feel as if that would load extremely slow with 750 products on shared hosting. 

What about shopify? Those of you who have used it, what are your thoughts? 

If you used both, which do you prefer?

Thanks!

Me and my partner are in the process of finalising our ecommerce jewelry business. Over the past few months we have been looking at instagram as a marketing platform and I have come across a number of animal themed jewelery sites.

What they have in common is that the products appear to have been sourced from alibaba or ali express and they all have significant instagram following with limited number of posts.

They also seem to use shout outs on popular animal instagram pages.

Im curious as to whether these sites are using instagress or something else to get large numbers of followers as they seem to have little or no other markerting I can find?

Perhaps they are run by those operating the animal instagram accounts?

On top of adding products daily I am marketing a lot (in my opinion). 

I am using stumbleupon, pinterest, and facebook as my main means of advertising. My bounce rate is really high at 91% on the main page. Averaging 109 visitors a day mainly from facebook. I would think since the site visitors are from my Facebook fanpage I would have a lower bounce rate. Maybe my site isn't loading fast enough. I try to change out the featured images every couple of days. Or I could have started my site at a very slow time. The day after Christmas I had 290 visitors but no sales. New years eve I only had 6 visitors and made a sale (WTH?). 

Since this is a starter site I want to learn as much as possible. I have four other sites in the works, and whatever I can learn will help me out a ton. Thank you in advance!

shopify,Working with the API console to fulfill orders,"Hello all,

I work for a shopify based company with a volume of about 150 orders a week. We're a very small business, so I manage the website and bookkeeping along with a few other things.

I very often have to fulfill only a few line items in an order and not others. This means that I sit for 45 minutes clicking through 100 orders and manually fulfilling the correct line items for each. Obviously, this is a pain in the ass, so I thought a nice little script would be able to take care of this for me. It's pretty basic programming, so I was/am fairly confident that I could do it.

However, I've had a hell of a time finding documentation or tutorials on using the shopify api gem with private apps. I would like to use a private app as opposed to a developer account because private apps don't deal with OAuth or hosting. I've figured out that the shopify api gem in ruby creates a little console from which you can access and edit your web store, which is perfect for my needs.

However all the documentation on this is very outdated, and through searches I've found many references to a shopify wiki which no longer exists. I'm pretty stuck. I know that I could figure out how to fulfill orders by line item through the console if I had some tutorial or documentation to follow. I haven't been able to find anything very helpful (besides a single page in the shopify dev docs).

Are there any resources out there for the shopify_api gem, and how to use it as a console? Also, is there a better place for me to ask about this? I've gotten fairly frustrated with all this. I would hire a developer, but 1) it's such a small project and 2) I really would like to learn the basics of developing a private app, so that in the future I can create more complicated apps for our store.

Thanks so much!

Edit: Oh, and if you're going to recommend shopify experts, I'm looking for someone to teach me how to do this development, not to do it for me. If you know of any experts that would take on such a small scale teaching product, please link me.

ecommerce,Shipping &amp; Multi-Channel Inventory w/ Wocommerce: Extensions vs Cloud Service,"Wow that is a long title.  

We are putting the finishing touches on our woocommerce site for the physical product we are launching in a couple months.

In addition to selling via our site, we also intend to sell on Amazon later this year. Another relevant fact is that fulfillment (pack out, shipping) is handled by the factory we are using for molding. We want to give them a login (whether for our site or a 3rd party service) where they can easily see orders from any channel and proceed to fulfill.

The big question seems to be whether to

A) Use our site as the means to manage all of this via extensions/plugins that integrate with Amazon (WP-Lister Amazon) and a shipping service (Stamps.com, many of those have add ons for woocommerce). With this option, anyone wanting to check orders, inventory, print shipping labels, etc would use the backend of our site for this. There usually is a one time cost for buying a license for these add ons.

B) use a web based service such as Veeqo, Ordoro, etc that pull in inventory/order data from our woocommerce shop, Amazon store and any others  and allow someone to login and manage orders. There is a monthly cost to these services.

Does anyone have experience based advise on these options that they'd be willing to share?

ecommerce,"[Help!] Trying to speed up my site and looking for feedback, tips, suggestions...","Hey everyone! About a year ago, I launch a business called Prospurly. I held an AMA in the /r/entrepreneur a few months back which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3qv4c3/im_the_founder_of_prospurly_and_have_grossed_over/) if you're interested more about the launch. 

My question today is... how do I make my site speed faster? Or is it fast enough? 

- I took a speedtest on a few speed test sites (GtMetrix, Wedpagetest, Google Developers Speed Test) and received [this](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cratejoy_vendor_images/prospurlybox/booksea-copy-1/images/Test_1.png) score from GTMetrix, which was the most understandable test for me (only partly tech-savvy). 

- After about an hour, I was able to fix a lot of issues and re-ran the report. My new test score is [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cratejoy_vendor_images/prospurlybox/booksea-copy-1/images/Test_7.png). 

- Don't want to click? **I shaved off about 2MBs of homepage size (7.12mb to 5.27mb) + decreased page load time by 2.2 sec (5.9s to 3.7s)**

It's still ranking my poorly in some areas, and I'm wondering if anyone has some magin ""1 line of code"" or piece of advice that could really help me out. Or am I over thinking it now that the load time is ~30% better? 

*Note: Any design notes, thoughts, or other tips for getting this page to convert better is well appreciated. Unfortunately, I don't have goals in GA set up well and have had so much un-qualified traffic to my site, it's hard to discern my real conversion rate, though I think it's around 2%.*

I would request members to dissect &amp; validate my assumptions and provide if I got my basics wrong or can proceed with the next steps.

Assumptions:  

1) New ecommerce stores have some paid/free means to get traffic.  
  
2) New stores are struggling to get sales because  
   
 a) products don't match visitor needs or visitor cannot find what they need.  
 b) products are too expensive or visitor considers them as expensive.  
 c) products shipping time and cost are too high.  
 d) store return or payment policies unsatisfactory.  
 e) presentation of products causes visitor to lose confidence in store.  
 f) bugs / slow response prevent certain transactions from being completed.  
  
3) e-commerce stores are willing to pay money for a new product/service which brings incremental sales.    
  
4) Store owners are willing to pay for a product which will allow visitors to invite their contacts to the store for a reward for himself and for his contact.  

5) Store owners are willing to pay for a product which will allow them to continuously send niche expert articles they write to their store visitors.

&gt; Yes. You can ship your products to us, and we will pick, pack and deliver the items to your customers when you tell us. This option, called Multi-Channel Fulfilment, allows you to sell your products via other channels such as your own website, other third party platforms and even in-store or catalogue sales but still take advantage of Amazon’s Fulfilment Centres and delivery expertise.

&gt; Multi-Channel Fulfilment is an option within the FBA programme to enable sellers to fulfil orders from sales channels other than Amazon such as their own website, other third party platforms and even in-store or catalogue sales using the inventory that they have stored in an Amazon Fulfilment Centre.

However, the other part of me knows that I can make it work. I am aware that many people have done this for themselves on a DIY, very casual basis. But I'm looking to make it more of a business. I've already made plenty of designs for people - granted, almost always family/people I know. I would upload designs but imgur is being wonky at the moment. One of my questions is whether or not I should perhaps take advantage of a site such as Etsy to market my idea? I'm not too excited when I think of opening an Etsy shop or similar alternative. I want to be in total control of my sales, and Etsy seems to be extremely competitive. I made a site on Weebly before, but that didn't work. How should I take the leap?

shopify,Any tips/advice on handling photo quality when images are compressed?,"Hi all! I scoured the Shopify forum, and I am having a hard time finding good information on ways to get around Shopify's image compression affecting the quality of pictures. I followed the instructions to save for web (as instructed by the help chat) in Photoshop before uploading, but my photo colors are off. 

I've recently started shooting my products indoors and purchased a light kit. With a little Lightroom and Photoshop help the images seem to look good when I open them directly from where I have them saved. The problem I'm facing is when I upload them to Shopify everything just looks dingy, and the nice crisp colors start having a dull grayish hue. Has anyone else experienced this issue and if so, how did you fix it? Are there photos apps I should install or is there a brightness/saturation formula that will help the images look better? Even when I try to over expose the images to make them brighter and then upload they still look off.

ecommerce,Brand Audit &amp; Valuation,"Fellow r/ecommerce redditors, a few months ago I had the pleasure of securing some great reddit feedback before my website launch. Things have been going well for the site (SEO &amp; publiciy wise). I am out of the woods yet. So I wanted to ask if you could audit my brand.

I own an online contemporary art gallery &amp; wanted to ask if you could give specific branding feedback. Answer any of these three questions - 

1. Do I communicate a clear message to the client as to what the brand identity is, and our value proposition? Is that message consistent? Would you enjoy or use our services?

2. What is my brand worth to you? Why would you choose our brand besides the gallery in your neighborhood? Do I help build your trust to buy my service? If so, why?

3.What is my brand equity monetarily worth? Dollars, cents - if you could take this company public, what would you IPO for? Coca cola's brand equity is millions of dollars because of its customer loyalty, its consistency, &amp; ease of access. Pick a number - any number.

Lastly, any thoughtful &amp; creative response is greatly appreciated. If it will help me visualize how an outsider sees the gallery - I will DM with a 12% coupon code.

ecommerce,Shopping cart for digital goods,"I want to set up a webstore to sell music files for my distribution company.  My hosting offers several different shopping cart options plus I can host the files so I don't need solutions like Payloadz.  I wanted to get input on which shopping cart would be best for my needs.

It absolutely needs:

-Digital download sales with automatic link to download location once sale is complete (I believe they usually do this via email).

-Quantity discounts.  The theme will be to create custom compilations, so each track will be .99, but if they buy 3 they get 10% off, 6 15% off, etc.

What would be nice but not a dealbreaker would be if a customer buys multiple tracks they can download them with a single link as a zip file, but that might not be feasible.

At the very minimum I would prefer it if someone buys multiple tracks, if they are given the download links by email that the links are all in a single email rather than each track in its own email.

shopify,Shopify rolling out SSL to stores - beware!,"This has resulted in a change to canonical_url which now reports the HTTPS protocol. The same change has not been applied it seems to shop.url, this still reports HTTP.

This has broken some parts of my stores that rely on canonical_url so look out!

EDIT: 
The change to the canonical_url happened in the last day or two. Having done a bit of reading I'm under the impression that you have to enable SSL on the store and this applies to Plus Plan and above stores only (though I am not sure). My affected stores are all basic plan and it would seem weird and stupid to have SSL for the canonical url, but not for the rest of the store.

shopify,Seeking to hire a .liquid coding expert,"I'm in need of a Shopify expert to do some custom coding on my website. Someone experienced and good at what they do should be able to do this work in about 20-25 hours. I'm flexible on budget, for the right person. 

My needs are detailed below in order of importance for me. My main concern right now is job #1. I'm using the Brooklyn Theme, and my site url is: crowncityscreenprinting.com.


#1: I own a screen printing company, printing apparel mainly for business clients (stores, restaurants...). Some of them have multiple store locations, with each location having a different design on the shirts that they wear. The managers of each separate store location need the ability to order the shirts for their specific store from my website.

What I need done:
Creation of separate pages for 5 business clients. These pages would be accessed via a password from the home page Log In button. When Business A, enters Password A on the home page, it will take them to the correct page for their business. When Business B enters Password B, it will take them to their correct page etc.

These pages will house a clickable name/logo of each location of the parent business. Then, when you click on a certain store location, it will take you to a page displaying the items for that particular store which you can purchase. You can choose the items you want, sending them into the cart. You then have ability to go to checkout, or return to the previous page and select a different store location, if you'd like.

Ultimately, I would require that you create a step by step guide to this process so as I gain new clients, I have the ability to add new pages for these clients myself. I have basic coding experience, but follow directions very well. 


#2:  I want minimum order quantities set up for the items I'm selling. Customers MUST order at least 15 items of each shirt style, before they're able to proceed to check out. So selecting 5 of Shirt A and 10 of Shirt B, would NOT allow you to proceed. However, 15 of Shirt A, would.


#3: On the home page, if you scroll down, you will see featured products. If you click on the Gildan G500 option, you will see it displays all of the photos of the various color options in descending order. You have to scroll forever to see them all. 

What I want is:
Remove all those photos piled up below the main photo. Then, to the right of the large main photo, have a clean looking clickable button list of all the color options for that garment style. When you click on a color option, that button highlights, and the main photo changes to show the corresponding color.

#4:  I want a portfolio photo page where I can feature photos of past shirts we've made. This will allow clients to see the type of work that we have done in the past. Obviously the ability to add and remove photos as needed is important.",6,3,2016-01-22,ECOM,0.035406794399023056,0.9327027201652527,0.031890518963336945

* Schools select the standard membership due  
* Schools select from a variable option box for each type of member (eg. Alternates are $50 ea, selecting 6 alternatives would add $300 to the base price.)  
* Final cost is calculated and the schools pay

ecommerce,Reasons why not to use Opencart,"I have been using Opencart for about 3 years now and it has done its job. However, every job can be done in a good and bad way. I just wanted to share my experience, as I think it would be helpful to other entrepreneurs in the longrun.

Opencart initially as a complete newbie to ecommerce seems to be one of the easier available options to install and use. Your shop can go online in a matter of hours, the admin panel is easy to use and understand, there are many nice templates and modules to use, there is a relatively active support community, etc. BUT...

My experience over time as my business started growing made me realize how limited the functionality of Opencart is. It lacks so many basic tools/utilities that should be integrated into any e-commerce solution by default. From shipping options, to payments, reports, newsletter functionality, abandoned carts, speed efficiency, SEO friendliness, discount/promotions, and the list just goes on. Although, many functions are available, they are available in the most basic and bare form. By no means are the default features viable for a complete and efficient e-commerce operation.

The solution to all these problems when using Opencart are the wide variety of extensions that are available to you. The list of extension is endless, some of them even free (although most decent ones that are supported are not). The extensions are great, but you will come to realize over time that you are spending quite a bit of money to build up a framework for Opencart that is typically by default in place with other open-source e-commerce solution. The matter of money put aside, there are more serious problems with these extensions...

Once you install and start using an extension you need to keep it up-to-date or it will break and cause errors. Opencart constantly comes out with new updates to its own ecommerce framework that have small improvements in them but which require most extension developers to regularly update their extensions as well in order to work with Opencarts framework update. Unfortunately, unless your extension is commercially very successful, most independent developers are quite sloppy about keeping their extensions updated. Even the ones that keep their extensions up-to-date most often than not don't test their updates clearly before releasing them, causing even further headache to you and damage to your site.

Not even do you have to deal with the regular updates of Opencart to their own framework, but the extension developers themselves may decide to update their own extensions independently of Opencart. These updates are typically due to changes in API feeds, bugs, etc. For example, a recent API feed update by the USPS caused one of my extension developers to release a faulty update that took down all JAVA functionality on my site, because it was not tested properly. The developer has since warned on not installing the updates and no further notice or update has been released since.

The problem becomes exponentially more difficult to deal with if you choose to have a custom theme. Many extensions are only capable of working with the default Opencart theme. Some developers choose to offer free theme customization to their customers, but many don't or at least unless you pay them. Once customized on your initial purchase, you will have to contact the developer on every Opencart and extension update to ask for a remake of the customization to make sure the extension still works with the update on your theme.

The problem boils down to not only you having to manage Opencart, but you essentially end up managing a series of modules. This is extremely time consuming and at times very frustrating as the updates often don't go as smooth as planned and disrupt your website and your business operations. All open-source platforms offer to a certain degree a set of extensions, but the problem with Opencart is that because its functionality by default is so minimal, you end up installing and managing way too many extensions.

Opencart has done it for me over the last 3 years, but I am ready to move on. It is a good product for a complete newbie to ecommerce to get started with, but if you are looking to build a complete and efficient e-commerce presence look elsewhere. Same goes with the mediocre web hosting solution of Arvixe that Opencart pushes.

I hope this is helpful to some. Good luck!",28,9,2016-01-24,ECOM,0.07297595590353012,0.8978469371795654,0.029177114367485046

Need your help in identifying a solution for our needs.  We started an ecommerce website and are in the process of getting the site setup. We wanted to make sure we setup the all the backend services the right way so we can scale nicely specially that we'll be warehousing our products in multiple locations. 

We need an inventory system that can help us do the following :
1. help us creat SKUs for our products what make sense (incorporate product type, classification etc.. Into the SKU numbering)
2. Help us store our products in racks and shelves in a way that the inventory system can identify the location for our packers , the solution would incorporate physical scanners to verify the packer's steps.
3. When an order via our shopify site comes in, the inventory system would inform our packer where the item is, which packaging box to use, which flyers to include with it, and have the process varied via scanning. For instance the picker would receive the order and the packaging and they flyer, the packer would scan the item ordered, scan the shelve code, scan the packaging, scan the flyer , this way the packer has a way of verifying that all steps have been done. Then once the product is processed for shipping , the item would be scanned and the system would have tell shopify to reduce the inventory level of the product 
4. As a phase 2 of our site we are looking to expand our geography to another country. So the inventory system would have to incorporate multiple geographers in multiple warehouses. 

Know of any system that is cost affective for an ecommerce site that would incorporate the above ?",5,6,2016-01-25,ECOM,0.0257868655025959,0.9399831295013428,0.03422998636960983
ecommerce,Choosing a fulfillment company,"We've noticed a lot of people ask ""Which fulfillment company should I use...?"" when expanding their eCommerce business, but not many answers which go over the process of making the actual decision. 

We wrote a how-to guide on how to choose the best order fulfillment company we thought we'd share; hope it gives some good insights and tips. (Disclaimer: We are a fulfillment company, but the guide is neutral.)

**HOW TO CHOOSE A FULFILLMENT COMPANY**

You’ve started your online business and it’s going better than you could have hoped for. With this incredible success comes a downside – you’re now spending more than half of your day packing boxes and making post office runs to satisfy the orders, instead of growing your business.

Maybe it’s time to think about outsourcing your order fulfillment. But how do you find the right fulfillment company? They will be handling a major part of your business, from inventory storage to packing and shipping and everything in between, not to mention what a big part timely deliveries are for overall customer satisfaction.

The best way to chose is to A) decide what you need and B) research, research, RESEARCH. We’ve narrowed down some key points for you to look into when shopping for a fulfillment partner.

“There are two very important things to consider when choosing a fulfillment partner. One, first figure out what your needs are and find a place that can actually help you,” offers Fulfillrite co-founder Joe Brieger. “Do they specialize in dealing with type of goods you sell? For example, if your company sells apparel, that category is known to have a high SKU count and 10% return rate. Does the company you’re looking at have experience in this area?”

The second point, Joe emphasizes, is “It’s not about saving money, it’s about a partnership. When choosing a fulfillment company, you are really bringing on a partner in your business. Choosing the right team can help your company grow; they care and want you to grow. Lots of companies out there are happy to just pack up your boxes and ship; look for a company who has the eCommerce experience to be able to share good advice and help build the relationship.”

**Reviews**

The internet has made it very easy to look up companies and their reputations, but also easy enough for some to make false claims. Trust in what real people have to say via reviews found on sites like Google, the Shopify app store, TrustPilot, etc. It’s also a good practice to reach out to some of their customers for direct feedback.

**Experience and Background Check**

How long has the company you’re looking at been around? Are they a start-up or a dinosaur? While 20+ years of experience is good on paper, are they holding on to outdated processes could be a hindrance in today’s fast-paced eCommerce and crowdfunding world? On the flipside, a young startup may not yet have the maturity to be able to take on any complicated projects or unexpected issues your business may encounter. 


**Technology/Integration**

Today’s eCommerce retailers expect – rightfully so – everything to automated, with the latest e-commerce integrations to be available right “out of the box.” Does the company you’re looking into integrate easily with the shopping cart solution you’re using; is its technology on the forefront? Will you have access to real-time data?


**Customer Service and Support**

This is so important; we can’t tell you how many businesses call us with stories of bad customer service they’ve been subjected to with other companies. Forming a strong relationship with your order fulfillment partners is key. When shopping around, ask about dedicated account managers, what the turnaround time on a support ticket generally would be and whom to speak to if an urgent issue arises. You will trust your inventory, business and reputation to them; it’s **critical** to know that there will be someone to help you if you need it.

**Location**

Choosing a fulfillment center by location depends on a variety of factors, one being your customer demographics. Do you have a mix of orders from all over the country/world, or is your product more location-centric? (You wouldn’t use a warehouse in Hawaii if your company sells, say, down jackets.) Our guide to [using a company with multiple warehouses](http://fulfillrite.com/blog/using-multiple-warehouses) goes over some excellent points on the matter.

Once you’ve decided on a few possible candidates, look deeper into their physical locations on a local scale. Are they located near major highways and shipping hubs? Travel time to shipping partners can mean a difference of a few hours to a day’s delivery time.

**Turnaround Time**

This is another question we are asked often, what is your turnaround time? This applies not just to pick and pack and getting your products out the door but also to receiving and inventorying inbound goods. (We process inbound goods between 1-3 days of receipt ship orders same-day if the order is placed by 1pm EST.)

**Costs and Transparency**

Now the big question – pricing. Before signing anything, do your homework to uncover all the expenses – set-up, storage, pick &amp; pack, account management fees, etc. Read the terms of service carefully so there are no surprises – transparency in pricing structure and fees is crucial (and is also a good indicator of the fulfillment company’s overall character.)

Once you have all the fees in a quote, you can do an estimate based on roughly a month’s worth of orders and come to a projection of what fulfillment would cost. 

Outsourcing your order fulfillment is a big step, but keep in mind it’s one that will move your business towards growth. Use due diligence in your research, get feedback from others and the right partnership will come.",4,6,2016-01-25,ECOM,0.029376710765063763,0.90702685713768,0.06359645910561085

ecommerce,Help identifying a WMS solution,"Hello experts, Need your help in identifying a warehouse and inventory management system (WMS) that can meet our ecommerce needs.

The WMS needs integrate with multiple ecommerce and marketplace channels so it will be taking orders from multiple OMS sources, but we will first launch on Shopify.

We need an WMS that can perform the following: Create SKUs for our products that follow a certain structure (incorporate product type, classification etc.. Into the SKU numbering) and have it integrate with an barcode / label printer

need the ability to assign an internal warehouse physical location for each SKU and also it's packaging requirements. The physical location needs to be detailed to the warehouse / zone / rack / shelf level, with physically scanning the location and sublocation for process flow accuracy, so the system needs to be able to dynamically read from scanners.

Automate the order fulfillment process for pickers. for instance, when an order comes in from our order management system, initially it will be shopify, the WMS would send the warehouse picker the order with each item location , the picker would have to physically scan warehouse, zone, rack, shelve and the items and scan which basket the items are in, then hand off the basket to the shipping area / department by also scanning that area for handoff. The WMS would also identify which packaging and which marketing material to include in the order before the order is sealed in the packaging for shipping. of course once the picker picks the items and scans them the multiple OMS channels need to be identified of the order and item inventory reduced.

Once the order is with shipping manager the wms needs to relay the shipping info / tracking details to the OMS to inform the end user.

Once we succeed in phase I of our ecommerce project want to be able to have another warehouse in another country but fulfilled by a 3rd party, so their WMS needs to be able to update our WMS on and sync /relay information between them. our WMS need to have the intelligence that once an order is received from the OMS it will know to which warehouse in which geography to send the order to.

So does anyone know of any WMS that is cost effective for an ecommerce startup site that would incorporate the above ?",5,4,2016-01-27,ECOM,0.039224814623594284,0.9333127737045288,0.027462420985102654

ecommerce,Setting up another site for my international customers.,"Hi, have a bit of an issue which I'm trying to work out the best way to  solve. 

Basically I have an ecommerce site (built on woocommerce) and I'm only licensed to sell my products to North Americans. So the site is therefore setup only to them. 

Now I have a new supplier who I am allowed to sell their product to non North American customers. I want to keep the original suppliers product for my current NA customers. 

So I'm just wondering how can I make it so the international visitors to my site see the new supplier products or get forwarded to a sister site or something like that.

If it matters most of my international customers come from referral links off another site of mine and to a smaller extend from search. 

Thanks in advance. Hope I explained clearly.",4,7,2016-01-31,ECOM,0.018237940967082977,0.9095774292945862,0.07218459993600845
