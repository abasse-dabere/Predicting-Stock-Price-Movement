ecommerce,"I put together some notes on how to improve ecommerce store experience, would love your input!","Every business owner loves happy customers.

Happy customers spend more, they tell their friends about you, and they leave glowing reviews.

They’re proof that you’re doing something right.

So how do you do it better?

# 1. Have a fast, easy-to-navigate site that communicates your value proposition well

As an ecommerce store, your website is your flagship. Your standard-bearer.

It’s where you make your sales, and it’s where you will be judged for every imperfection and typo.

Everlane’s site embodies the same simple, minimalist principles that its products do.

###  A. Site speed &amp; Navigation

Consumers are getting more impatient than ever.

They WILL bounce from your site if it’s either too slow to load, or it’s taking them too long to figure out what’s going on.

Too many ecommerce stores try to do too much and squeeze in so many things into their site that it becomes cumbersome.

The fastest ecommerce sites load in under 0.5 seconds.

* Avoid uploading images that have excessively high resolutions – resize your images to their appropriate size before uploading.
* Avoid using picture formats that are not optimized for web (e.g. TIF); use web-optimized image formats like GIF, JPEG or PNG instead.

Things to measure:

* Check out your Bounce rate on Google Analytics
* Check your site loading time on tools.pingdom.com
* Look at your clickthrough rates

### B: Communicate your value proposition

It’s great to have a fast, easy-to-navigate site, but all of that is worthless if nobody cares about what’s on it.

You want anybody who lands on your website to be able to quickly and easily tell what your product can do for them.

Slim wallet makers Bellroy are very good at this.

To get good at this, you need to be able to answer several questions:

* What IS your brand’s value proposition? What exactly are you helping your customers to do? How are you different from all the other alternatives out there in the marketplace? (Check out Simon Sinek’s Start With Why for inspiration.)
* What’s your brand’s voice? Are you more Disney or Harley-Davidson? You’ll want to have a clear, coherent voice throughout your entire store (and all your other touchpoints!) so that your customers come away with a strong impression of who you are. It makes you memorable, which also makes you easier to talk about.

# 2. Have compelling product pages that convert well

Every product page has just one job – it needs to convince the visitor that the product is worth buying.

It should have…

* Pricing, obviously
* Great pictures in a variety of contexts to help the visitor imagine how they’d use it
* Product details – sizing, color, material information
* Additional descriptive information that sells the product

Nisolo does a good job here.

Things to pay attention to:

* **Copywriting** – is it informative and on-brand?
* **Visuals** – are they strong and consistent?
* **Navigation** – is it simple and intuitive?

# 3. Streamline your checkout process – make sure your site is easy to navigate

This is an entire field of ecommerce specialization called Checkout Optimization, and every ecommerce store should always be working on this regardless of what you’re selling.

* Make “Add To Cart” simple and clear
* Have the “Pay Now” button staring at them at all times
* Display your cart contents well
* Offer a guest checkout

ASOS does this well.

### Offer free shipping – customers love it

Do you offer free shipping? You should! As Anna Kegler from RJMetrics puts it, “Free shipping influences consumer behavior on a deeply psychological (and often irrational) level, adding a powerful boost to your average order value.”

It’s been proven over and over again that customers would rather spend more on the product and have free shipping, than save on the product and spend more for shipping.

### Make sure your “add to cart” system is super clear

Have a pop-up window saying “item has been added to cart; do you want to visit your cart, or continue shopping?”. Cole Haan does a good job of this.

Alternatively, direct users to the shopping cart page once they add an item to it, like in the case of Warby Parker or Sunpocket.

# 4. Have a coherent, systematic content strategy

The North Face does a great job of this. Rather than focusing entirely on their products, they use their blog as an opportunity to celebrate their customers.

Your customers are buying your products because they want it to help them do something. You want to talk about that. You want to help to clarify the desire that they already have.

When they associate that with you and your brand, they’re that much likelier to decide to buy your products.

Story by ModCloth is another great example to study. The blog is a great companion and destination for potential shoppers, and like TNF’s blog, there’s zero sales content.

Blog posts cover everything from interview features with trendy individuals, occasion-specific style advice, gift guides, travel tips and advice, and even delicious recipes.

What to measure:

* **Make sure every single one of your content pieces has a job to do.** You want to be clear about what that job is, and you want to evaluate how effective you are at achieving that end.
* **Search intent.** Search traffic is almost always going to be your primary source of traffic – you don’t want blogposts to get a short bump of traffic from social and then die out. Make sure each blogpost targets a particular string of words that your customers would type into Google.
* **Think systems, not random acts of marketing.** You want to have a regular publishing calendar, so you don’t go long periods of time without publishing anything. You want to be distributing your content on social media regularly, too.

# 5. Build a great community on social media, organically

A study from IAB found that 90% of consumers would recommend a brand to others after interacting with them on social media.

Black Milk Clothing is a great example to follow here. They have lots of Facebook groups around the world, including a massive “Sell, Swap, Buy” group with over 15,000 members.

They also feature customers’ Instagram photos on their actual product pages, which gives social currency to their happy customers AND makes it easier for new customers to see what the products look like on real people.

# 6. Keep your emails bold, short and snappy

There are several parts to the email system of any ecommerce store.

* Marketing emails you send to prospective customers
* Abandoned cart emails you send to customers who didn’t complete checkout
* Purchase completion emails
* Support emails, and others

In all cases, as with the rest of your content, you want to be clear…

* **Test your subject lines.** Most customers have gotten used to stale, predictable subject lines, so you want to experiment with being informal and evocative. What would get YOU excited to open an email in a cluttered inbox?
* **Measure your open rates.** You could be sending tonnes of emails out, but if nobody’s opening them then you’re wasting your time.
* **Keep your emails simple with a clear, single call-to-action.** It’s tempting to give your readers lots of options, but that makes it likelier that they’ll move on to the next one. Give them one specific thing to say yes to.

# 7. Craft a compelling product experience

Apple is probably the gold standard here, but there are lots of ordinary retailers who do this well too.

Beardbrand is one such example of a brand that manages to create a fun unboxing experience for its customers.

What if you’re selling something that doesn’t fit into a fun little box?

You can still encourage your customers to share the product on social media:

# 8: Post-purchase – engage with your happy customers!

Dappertime encourages its customers to show off their watches on Instagram – social currency for them, social proof for future customers.

Your relationship with your customers doesn’t end after they hand you their cash and you deliver them your product.

Happy customers are incredibly valuable – they’re the source of your most important word-of-mouth.

One of the things you want to do early and often is to collect information from your customers.

# 9. Be sure to provide stellar support when things break or go wrong

Seth Godin has often written about how important and powerful it is to do great customer service, and how so many businesses get it wrong by trying to cut costs here.

A customer with a broken or spoilt product or some other unhappy scenario is going to be more emotional than a customer that’s happy or shopping around. They could leave you a terrible review or a fantastic one, depending on how you handle them. They could come away hating your brand and telling everyone to boycott you, or they could turn into a raving fan that helps you get many, many more sales.

One of my favorite stories here is of an Amazon customer service rep’s hilarious role-playing exchange with a customer, which went viral on Reddit.

# 10. Ask for reviews

Reviews are already a huge part of how the ecommerce world works. It’s obvious that this is a trend that isn’t going to go backwards – consumers are going to keep wanting more and more information about products, not less. And as consumers we trust information from one another way more than we trust information in advertising.

It’s even plausible that an effective review-getting strategy might help to establish a competitive advantage. There’s a virtuous cycle there – delight your customers, get good reviews, get more new customers, get more good reviews, and so on.

# 11. Run a referral program

The Growth team at Airbnb pointed out something unique about referral programs – they’re one of the only ways for a business to reach directly to the friends of their customers.

But you only get to do that if you’ve already sufficiently delighted your customers, so make sure that you’ve already gotten some good reviews and social media feedback.

GREATS has had some serious success with their referral program.


# Here’s a recap of some numbers and metics that you’ll want to be keeping an eye on:

1. **Repeat / referral sales volume.** This will vary from industry to industry – people seldom buy multiple mattresses, for example. But recurring sales in general are a good sign. Repeat customers are also probably more open to giving you feedback.

2. **Quantity and quality of reviews.** What’s the frequency of reviews that you’re getting? You might want to use a tool like Yotpo.

3. **Sentiments on social media.** You want to constantly be doing searches on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and so on to see what people are saying about your business. Consider setting up a Google Alert for mentions of your brand, or even use paid tools like Mention or Ahrefs.

4. **Replies to support emails.** Unhappy or frustrated customers can give you some of the most valuable information you’ll ever get to make your business better.

5. **Net Promoter Scores.** Want to know if your customers would refer your store? Why not ask them outright?

6. **Customer referrals**. If you’re getting at least a hundred transactions a month, and you’ve gotten some positive mentions on social media, it’s worth setting up a referral program to see if you can get customer referrals. There’s no better proof that people love what you do.

7. **Talk to your customers!** This takes the most work, but can be the most illuminating. Andy Dunn from Bonobos reached out to thousands of their customers to ask them what their favorite things about the brand were, then incorporated their feedback into the branding of the store. If you have customers that you haven’t spoken to in a while, reach out for a chat.

dropship,Newbie questions about drop shipping.,"First off, sorry if this has been asked before but I noticed the FAQ is broken. I tried checking there first. 

I'm looking into starting an online store powered by drop shippers. 

This post is about the first steps one must take before selling any products. I am in California, if that makes any difference. 

My understanding is that I should first go to my local city offices and get a business license. Then, submit the paperwork for the fictitious business name. Once that is done I should form a LLC. After those steps are done I should then apply for a Resale Certificate, and EIN. 

Once all of the above is complete I can then begin to set up my shop and start contacting dropshippers. 

Am I on the right track here? Can anyone provide some insight on the legal aspects of this type of business? I may be completely off here but am finding it difficult to find detailed information.

I recently started my ecommerce store and so far things are going well. I got my first clients and it seems that the website is okey. However, I want to grow the whole thing.

ecommerce,Please help with registration page design to boost registrations,"Hi, my website is for people that want to learn Mandarin on Skype with a live tutor.  My registration/signup page is at http://www.mandarintutor.com/register.  In general, people need to register first in order to see the schedule of my tutors.  I plan to make the following changes to reduce the number of fields on my registration page, in a hope to boost more registrations:

&amp;nbsp;

1) Eliminate the Username field.  Moving forward, my site won't use usernames/userid.  Instead, users will use their e-mail to login instead of a username (e-mail is critical field for my site).  

&amp;nbsp;

2) Eliminate the second password field (""Re-enter password"" field).  I've been reading that a single password field can be used instead with a checkbox or button that allows the user to show/hide the password.

&amp;nbsp;

3)  I'm thinking of moving the requirement to fill in the ""Skype Name"" field until after the original registration is completed.  I plan to reintroduce the requirement to fill in the ""Skype Name"" field when the student has seen the tutor's schedule and has selected a time to book the lesson.  It seems more natural to make the student fill in their Skype Name at that time, wouldn't it?

&amp;nbsp;

4) Eliminate the radio button and subsequent section to allow students to fill in additional information about themselves.  This information is very valuable for my tutors.  I plan to reintroduce this section along with the Skype Name field in 3), after the student has selected a time to book a lesson with the tutor.

&amp;nbsp;

By doing this, **I can reduce 8 fields down to 4** (although 2 of the fields - the Skype Name field and the Additional Information field - are to be filled later in the process of booking a lesson).  Unfortunately, A/B testing is not reliable for me because my site's traffic and registration is quite low at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

What do you think?  Any help or criticism would be appreciated.  Thank you.",6,3,2016-11-04,ECOM,0.051132023334503174,0.9236245155334473,0.02524351142346859

Those who sell apparel: how do you deal with returns, exchanges, and refunds?  I have noticed that a lot of apparel drop shipping websites simply state all sales final or ""please choose carefully, if you like to exchange, you are responsible for return shipment costs etc."" 

Although those statements are clear for the customer, I am scared that if I go that route it will deter people from ordering.

What are some best practices for handling returns, exchanges, and refunds when it comes to apparel?

I've been doing some work on an ecommerce page for a few months now. I have learned a ton, but still have a long way to go when it comes to being efficient at selling online.

ecommerce,Need your experienced advice,"Hi guys. This is gonna be a long story but Ill try to make it really cool to read with some tl;dr (too long didnt read resume for each paragraph). 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introduction**

&amp;nbsp;

Recently (2016-10-23), I launched my first eCommerce. Made with Alidropship plugin, Im selling Pug related items (t-shirt, shoes, jewelry, etc). The name is PugForLife. I created a Facebook and Instagram page. The goal was to provide pug owner low prices everyday life items so they could have a smile every time they use it.

*tl;dr: Launched an eCommerce where I sell Pug related items in 2016-10-23).*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Strategy used**

&amp;nbsp;

1- At first, I called my page in a few pug lover groups who allowed me to do. I also paid like 30-40$ in Facebook ads to get like on my page. I reached like 350 likes.

2- I tried to sell some basic stuff through Facebook ads on my page and on Facebook. Tried with pug slippers, pug beanie, pug underwear, pug watch. Paid like 75$ pubs and got 0 sale.

3- I also tried to generate traffic on my website with blog post. I rate the quality of my post on a scale of 0 to 10 a 5. It was easy reading stuff. No sale reported with this.

4- To add more credibility to my Facebook page, I paid low cost facebook ads and got like 1,000 new likes on my Facebook page. They were like from Pakistan and Indian peoples. (First big mistake here.) I have now low quality likes on my Facebook page and it gave nothing. It just cost me more if I want to pay for ads on my page.

5- Im on a lot of pug groups, and Im trying to look at what people buy when they share something. I approached people who were sharing items at higher price than what Im selling and told them I have it too for lower. It usually worked.

6- For the moment, Im trying to sell something free and tell people to only pay for shipping. Its a low cost item and I ask 5$ for the shipping. Im also trying Reddit ads.

So in resume, paid approximately 100$ in ads, got 0 sale from this. I made 200$ revenue for a profit of 100$ with no ads technics. Traffic on my website is 1929 since the launching for 4 sales.

*tl;dr: Tried a couple of things, did mistakes and spend $$ in ads for a couple of likes and no sales. What worked a little bit is writing to people who said they needed stuff directly.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**My questioning**

&amp;nbsp;

I admit that my researched before this project were unperfect. I failed pretty much everywhere and I thought my niche didnt have a lot of competitors but he does. I also didnt look on google keywords planner like I should have done it. I ****ed up here big times. So I wonder if my niche is not too small for the competitors there. 

*tl;dr: Is my niche too small for how much competitors there is?*

I also wonder if I have to spend more money to get visibility for my brand. I sure do, but it is worth the shot? I know that no one can answer this, I need to try. But the fact that Im not able to sell the most popular items from Aliexpress with Facebook ads make me think this niche is not a good one.

*tl;dr: My 0 sale from Facebook ads makes me doubt about the rentability of my niche.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion**

&amp;nbsp;

So guys, what do you think about this? I dont want to be someone whos going from project to project because its not going fast. I just want to be able to analyse the facts and act.

*Big tl;dr: Is it normal that I dont get any sale when spending money in Facebook ads to sell popular products?*

Thanks guys. Im french so sorry if my english gave you cancer.

shopify,Your Shopify store formatted as a native iPhone app,"Hi all,

I'm a developer and just launched an iPhone app: http://shopworks.io.  It's a commerce-optimized web browser for your phone.

It automatically converts your Shopify online store into an mini app inside the Shopworks app.  The advantage of this is it loads faster that a website and is easier for people to shop from their phone.  And payments are built right in so you get superior conversion rates.  Also, your items show up in the built in search results so it's built in SEO.  It's free and you get access to all the people who use the app.

How Shopworks works:
1. A shopper searches for your store or types in your store domain in Shopworks.
1. It looks at your website and reformats the html as native interface components in the Shopworks app.  
2. When orders are placed in the app, it is directly placed on your website.  There's no difference between an order placed through Shopworks and your website.  I.e. there are no changes to your shipping workflow, accounting procedures, stock quantities, etc.

I'd love some feedback from merchants, as it's in beta stage!",0,4,2016-11-10,ECOM,0.020893245935440063,0.9359995722770691,0.043107207864522934

dropship,"$2,427 in 1 month: using Instagram in SMM strategies for AliExpress dropshipping store","This is a post for everyone willing to boost their online business through social networks. I will use the example of Seven Kingdoms Mart webstore developed and supported by AliDropship team who did an incredible job of building up a relatively young business and also was kind enough to provide public access to this info.
So Seven Kingdoms Mart is a webstore based on the [AliDropship plugin](https://alidropship.com/) for Wordpress that is dedicated to Game of Thrones thematic merch. To make the webstore even more popular, it was decided by the promotion team to use Instagram shoutouts. Shoutouts mean that you find other niche related accounts with a huge number of subscribers and ask the owner to publish your own promotional posts on a paid basis. These posts should include a product image,a link to the product page, a short enticing caption and hashtags.
You need to duplicate this post in your own account and answer comments and questions about the product, and advise where to buy it.
For Seven Kingdoms Mart the strategy has resulted in 6500% increase in the number of sales in just 3 months (from March till May 2016) with the average monthly income of $2,427. The full promotion process is described in detail in AliDropship blog - https://alidropship.com/how-to-promote-a-dropshipping-store-on-instagram/, and that’s quite an experience to share with a wide audience.

dropship,[Request for Support] Please Join a Fellow Newbie Student in Drop Shipping,"My name is Low. I'm trying to learn how to drop ship. I joined a dozen forums and FB Groups in the process but something was lacking. I felt like I was the only newbie there; it was pretty intimidating and made it hard to ask questions. At the same time, everyone is everywhere doing their own thing. I needed something more...like what about a community that put members at certain level in a specific group who can help motivate and push each other forward; a place where the members are actively engaging and taking action toward their goals; a group that is constantly building momentum. How about we create this community and in it, there are category of groups with clear guidelines and milestones for when someone joins, they can quickly get up-to-date and be on their way to their first sale right off the bat? Imagine having a consultant walk you through 1-on-1 until it finally clicks ─ wouldn't that be awesome?

https://youtu.be/61SoiwJPF-8

I want this community to offer something more than just drop shipping how-to's. I want to see accountability, positivity, motivation, inspiration, and a whole lot of action. I want people to ask stupid questions over and over. I want to prove to the naysayers that making money online is not only possible but anyone with the right formula can succeed too. I want to prove that you can leverage the power of broke and still generate a sizable income with the right effort. I want people like you who want it so bad that you'll work your ass off alongside me. I want friends on this journey with me. I want to dominate drop shipping with people who are hungry and thirsty to try again and again.

But first, it takes time. 

We need results, case studies, mentors, and resources. I'm not worried about that though. The more people we have, the more answers there are. Imagine everyone applying what they learn as they go and then give back to the community. On top of that, I hope this group will offer insane value through peer support and resources. I know I will get a lot of value out of weekly meetings either through video chat or group messaging.

In a way, it's like a mastermind built on top of a drop shipping group but with optional features for those who need it. So if you're interested in joining a community like this, please, please head over to our Facebook Page @ https://www.facebook.com/groups/dominatedropshipping

ecommerce,What marketing to do as a seasonal business with one time customers?,"Three months ago we started to sell outdoor flooring and fences (on- and offline), wich doesn't sell in the winter and searches on google are low. I come from a computer science background and my partner has had a local metal construction business (and still has). I still have plenty of work to do on the website but would like to know more about marketing and social media as a seasonal business.

I imagine a potential customer would be some one who needs a fence for example and starts searching for it. Then potentially

Wich social media can work for me and how does it help us get found? Pinterest seems like a perfect fit. I'm not 100% sure about what to do on FB. I have zero twitter and instagram experience and don't know how they can benefit me as I don't think people would ""follow"" us.

Right now I'm still working on about us, FAQ, and similar essential pages and written articles that show our competence, inform the reader and help SEO.

The competition in my country seems to be sleeping and lack many social media accounts and FB isn't that active on any of them. Most online roccomendations for them seem to come from forums, advertising and mouth to mouth refferals.

However, I think it's an interesting question. The goal obviously is to get as much clickthrough as possible from that page.

ecommerce,Funnel Optimization of a eCommerce Home Page,"Client states he wants to break his home page traffic down into two channels. ""Meals on Wheels"" &amp; ""Health Care"". The current state of his page has no clear paths. He also has a video about his product he wants front and center.

Current home page. 

http://imgur.com/a/bZQuX


There was a few ways to go about this. We could setup another store view within Magento, separate domains and channel the traffic as two different stores completely. That's going to require a lot of overhead and redirects etc etc. 

The most cost effective route to take is to channel his current site into two channels. Consolidate his category structures and offerings into two main segments and offer paths for each.  

The main goal was to offer a clear path and to funnel traffic into one or the other. The hero banner will popup a video in a on-demand lightbox (not to weigh the page down with a iframe). 

Then below that you have two paths to take. Either OR. That or the menu is consolidated to the main two categories as well. 

Reworked home page. 

http://imgur.com/a/m6NzK

The deliverables are as follows.

1. Remove addtional space under and around logo. This will bring up the page fold a little higher. Have a home icon in instead of text. 

2. Restructure categories into two main segments. That should leave us with the Two menu paths of Meals on Wheels or Health Care.

2. A hero banner - Display in a lightbox (fancybox http://wpandsuch.com/posts/fancybox-youtube/ ) when clicked. The video would auto play on demand. The customer wouldnt leave the page. 

3. Take the hero text intro taken from your text block and place it below the hero banner.

4. Below the hero; two additional graphics with clear Call to Actions leading to Meals on Wheels or Health Care.

5. Remove the additional banners &amp; ""Featured Products"", clutter on the home page.

6. Inline the footer contact info, Add payment info. Trust etc.

6. PSD files.

I have recently started working for a fashion start-up and we have just launched our e-commerce website. It’s been a few months of hard work to get it to where it is now! I would love some feedback/critique from you guys regarding the store. Are we missing anything?
We want to create a brand and sell original and high quality leather goods that have an edge and personality. All the bags and accessories are designed by Gabrielle, the founder, and Kerry, her long-term friend and actually made in Bali. I only came on board a few months ago to get the business off the ground online. 
The brand is House of Tindale and our website is **www.houseoftindale.com** If you wish to check out our Instagram account and some photos we are **@houseoftindale**
We have sold a few bags in launch week with a pretty amazing offer of $150 off, and sales mainly went to people who know Gabrielle from childhood. We figure it’s a lot about building trust in her as the face of the brand.
As for marketing, we are only just starting, I have ensured everything is optimised for SEO, we have grown IG over the past few months and are running a few FB ads - without much conversion success though! Is it about the products being quite expensive? What’s your take on it?

hoping maybe someone could point me in the right direction.

I have an online woocommerce store, on which I use shipping calculator plugin for a shipping aggregator compnay that we use.
Essentially the calculator is at the top of the checkout page, the customer inputs their ZIP code, and the available courier options and prices show up for the customer to select one. The shipping charge is then automatically added.

Unfortunately I had a customer order come through this morning with no shipping charge. After investigating, I've found it is possible to a customer to just skip the shipping calculator stage and process and payment/order with no shipping charge.

I'm hoping there is some way I can enforce the shipping charge to be &gt;$0 before being able to make payment.",3,3,2016-11-17,ECOM,0.027046065777540207,0.9295424222946167,0.04341152682900429

It cold just be the product or the pricing. However if you guys could check the checkout process and let me know if I missed something or if something is off, that would be awesome. 

Shopify doesn't allow for much customization of the checkout process, at least not easily, which is frustrating. And I'm using a free theme so perhaps it would be worth migrating to a different theme for better checkouts and conversions?

ecommerce,My nightmare fulfillment centre ordeal and tips on how to pick a good one.,"Hello, I am the owner of [Bells of Steel](https://bellsofsteel.com) a Canadian ecommerce website selling fitness equipment. 

I've been in business for 6 years and am now on my 4th fulfillment company. 

Something that I have rarely seen discussed is; what if your fulfillment centre can't fulfill? Like any business they must keep staff from turning over and operate at close to capacity to maintain profits, without going over capacity and deteriorating service. 

This is exactly what happened to me and I paid a steep price. 

I had been with my 3PL (to remain un named as a legal battle is likely) for 2.5 years and had begun seeing a decline in turnover time dating back as far as Christmas 2015. It hit a pinnacle in February, when orders were taking a week plus to ship instead of 24 hours as guaranteed. 

In discussions with the owners, they promised things would change, they would hire more staff, etc. Then shortly after our talk, they fired their whole floor team, guys I really liked and basically blamed everything on them. I should have left then, but I just didn't want to deal with the move, it's a huge pain in the ass. 

April roles around, things are still bad, my business is rapidly growing and I have 3 containers coming in a few months. Again the world is promised and the fool that I am I don't trust my gut and get out. 

The containers land in September and things have come to a grinding halt. The owners ask me to come in to help with some questions, I visit the warehouse and it is utter chaos. 

Pallets stacked on pallets jammed in every nook and cranny of the place. I ask to see my inventory and I am literally having to climb over other customers's pallets to see my stuff. 

I tell the owners if they don't have everything moving and sorted within 2 weeks I will need to leave. They promise they will. After 1 week almost nothing has moved and I pull the plug. 

I find a new 3PL who are keen to take me on as I am a good account for them, they meet my criteria and even offer to ship my stuff over for free. The sales guy just wants to take a look at the old warehouse to check my stuff out. After seeing the place and the state the old 3pl had left my equipment in, he turned me down. I pleaded with him to not leave me hanging and he agreed. 

Into mid October, I have to arrange 3 trucks to go over to transfer my stuff, as every time I send a truck they make them wait for hours and then give them half a load. When the final truck is due, they switch the date on me. The demand I pay a $2000 exit fee and when I threaten legal action, they tell me they won't release any of my equipment if I want to play that game. 

Finally, into November, I am settled into my new warehouse after over 150 man hours to sort my stuff and put it away. And at the end of the ordeal I am over 20K deep factoring in lost orders, shipping fees, damages to reputation, etc. 

A hard lesson learned, but I thought I would share how I went about picking my next 3pl who I have high hopes for (but am not holding my breath). 

**Step 1**
Emailing new companies. I basically copy and pasted about 20 different 3PL's into the bcc of an email and sent them a series of questions, here's what I asked them
Do you have: 
1. Online and up to date inventory/order entry system (preferably barcode friendly). Does it integrate with woocommerce to auto enter orders? Is it an in house software or 3rd party (3rd party is ideal, in house will always be more  cumbersome)
2. 24 hour guaranteed turnover time? Would you be willing to put a financial penalty if orders go over 24 hours?
3. ability to handle returns
4. Ability to handle customer pick ups. 
5. 2 references from current customers. 

Once I narrowed that down, I would arrange a visit to inspect. Here's what I looked for and questions that I asked:
1. Depending on your product size, but in my case, at least a 40,000sq ft warehouse
2. Do they have room to expand as I grow, as in bays next door they can rent?
3. Is it clean (floor is swept)
4. How many people on the floor, how many in the admin
5. How long have the staff been there
6. Do the staff seem happy

Anyways I hope this helps. I am now deliberating opening up my own warehouse/store front, but I just don't know if it's feasible. Priority now is to get through Christmas and regain the trust with a lot of furious customers.",13,10,2016-11-22,ECOM,0.07941636443138123,0.8908604383468628,0.029723184183239937

ecommerce,Tips When Choosing an eCommerce Platform to Launch Your Online Shop.,"Hello, 

I'm currently helping my dad launch his online shop. I'm hoping that you guys could give me some advice on what to look out for when choosing your eCommerce Platform. 

All these companies provide such ""amazing deals"", but I just want some honest, straight forward deals! These marketing and tech jargons are making my head spin. They say they give you all these amazing things, but if you read the small print, SSL certificate must be obtained from 3rd party, or there's extra charges for things you've never heard of... but a procedure as simple as URL submission is included in their ""amazing package"". 

I've tried out platforms like Shopify, Weebly, Squarespace and by far, my favourite is Shopify but it's a bit more expensive, not including the commission they charge. I'm based in Malaysia and I've looked at WebShaper, but I don't like the templates inability to resize images. Looked at EasyStore, too little features.

What are the BASICS that I should pay attention to when starting an online shop? i.e. 

1. SSL Certificate
2. URL Submission
3. Domain Hosting
4. Web Hosting 
5. what else? 

Thank you so much!!! I really appreciate it.",10,5,2016-11-22,ECOM,0.01996561698615551,0.926024317741394,0.0540100522339344

I mean, anybody can look at the map sites and see what it really is... and you can just pay to hide your actual address on your domain now anyway. So I started wondering... Do I really need to pay hundreds of dollars a year for a PO box address, just to technicaly have a physical address on the site? How detrimental is it NOT to have a physical address on a site. In some ways, it almost seems more shady looking to have a PO box address, than no address at all.

ecommerce,"Buying a small warehouse/office for our ecommerce business. Question about finding ""roommates"".","Hey everyone

We are in Phoenix area and in the process of buying a warehouse building with 5 neat offices, and a huge lot in the back. This is to store our bulky items (boxes 20x24x28"" mostly), and a real estate investment at the same time. 

This place is too big for us. It can hold multiple container loads of goods. I'm also thinking of building self storage units at the lot behind. 

I'm looking for other small ecommerce people like me or you, who'd like to upgrade from the garage settings, have an office address and not a home address or PO box, and possibly receive goods by container easily, send LTL to their customers etc.

So we are not planning to be a fulfillment center (currently), but just a place for people to store their goods they sell online, a receiving dock for their freight shipments, and daily FedEx, UPS pickup place. 

Here are my questions:
1. Have you ever needed such a place? When things got bigger than garage operation (maybe bought a container of goods), what did you do?
2. If you were interested in such a place, would you have been more interested in a big warehouse that's partitioned (possibly with portable fences, and locked gates) or have an individual storage space in the back. 
3. Where can I find more people like me to have ""roommates""?
4. Any drawbacks of this setup I had in mind for me or for my ""roommates"" that I'm not seeing because I'm just too excited right now?

I'm open to any suggestions and input. We'll try to buy this place regardless as a real estate investment and to make our job easier. We're just trying to lower the operating costs of the place by sharing the spaces we won't be utilizing. 

Maaaaybe eventually, if things work out we may pivot towards being a fulfillment center too but it's not the current intent.

I'm pretty new to dropshipping. I've been researching it for quite a few months but I've only started looking at it seriously in the past few days.

I found a great website that I'd like to dropship from but the shipping would take a long time.

Firstly it isn't flatrate shipping, it's calculated by the weight of the order. This part doesn't bother me too much, I could just do shipping cost at different intervals (like $5 up to x weight, then $10 up to y weight, ect.) but the shipping says it would take 10-30 days (7-25 business days) and I don't know if people would purchase from me due to the long shipping time.

I would like to offer the express shipping option (2-5 business days) but it costs nearly $30 for a single item.

To me I have two options:

1. Sell products and shipping at their proper rates and add all shipping options available so the customer can choose what they want.

2. Make products a little more expensive to be able to reduce the cost of shipping. I'd also include all shipping options.

I'm not sure which is better. I feel like the first option would look better because products are cheaper, but with the second option the shipping isn't as expensive which could make the customer feel better about it taking longer.

shopify,"I'm giving free help (*NO* sales pitches or upselling) for Shopify users. If you need help programming, or advice converting traffic, sign up for a one-hour video call with me","Hi Shopifolk!

Let's get straight to it:

### The Offer (TL;DR)

If you have any questions, or want help with your store -- especially any technical/theme issues, or advice on making conversions -- I'll spend some time with you over video, screen sharing, working on those issues. In exchange, I'd like to spend 15-20 minutes asking you about your experience as a shop owner.

We'll spend the rest of the time talking about whatever you'd like, and I'll make myself available for followup as well.

To sign up, [visit this link](https://calendly.com/jessedhillon/shopify)

### Who I Am 

I've been spending a lot of time on this subreddit and the Shopify forums giving people feedback on their stores, or help adjusting their themes. I like helping shop owners and I'd like to meet you face-to-face, virtually :)

I'm a software engineer with 15 years of experience building websites, applications, and software in general. I have a CS degree from UC Berkeley and have spent several years working as in engineering and product management at some of the largest startups in the world.

What others have said about the same help I offered them:

&gt; ... [I] encountered several issues with the theme in the online store. Jesse has then solved and guided me along the way very patiently and quickly. He offers useful advices for the online store during the process as well.

&gt; I have no similar HTML/CSS coding experiences and yet I have managed to add/remove/edit the codes with his help.

&gt; 4 Days ago, we made the changes based on the feedback from Jesse ...  we had more orders than we were prepared to handle today. I had to run out and get more shipping supplies. (a good problem to have no doubt)

(this last one is from a shop owner who previously was not getting *any* conversions)

### The Catch

So, yes -- there *is* a catch, but it's a small one!

I'm now building a Shopify app which I think can drastically simplify management of your online store, and I'd like to talk to you about your experiences and challenges as a Shopify user.

I want to make sure I'm building something that people like you would find helpful.

ecommerce,12 Awfully Lame But So Damn True Tips For 2016 Holiday Season,"Hi everyone! Black Friday has passed away and I saw so many mistakes shop owners had made in their promotional strategy that I decided to create a funny infographic about it - 12 Awfully Lame but So Damn True Tips to Mess Up Yor Ecommerce Holiday Season.

I will publish just a written list of these nasty tips here (unfortunately I'm not allowed to show you the graphic) and maybe it will help some of you to reconsider the whole strategy before Big Christmas Sales and not making all these mistakes. 
Any feedback is welcome ;)

1.	Disregard peak season planning. Screw those promotional calendars, social media plans, KPIs and such. Just sell, that’s it. Customers will be flocking anyway – these are holidays after all. 
2.	Forget about mobile website optimization. Who on earth is making purchases via mobile devices? Those annoying tiny pics, endless zooming – everybody hates them!
3.	Website loading time, security patches, bugs and loopholes – leave all these bores to geeks and techies. Why bother putting your website to the test when everything is running like clockwork? You know there’s gonna be a spike in traffic but what of it? After all your website is not a paper bag – it won’t tear anyway.
4.	Holiday-themed content? Naah, you’re out of touch. No, seriously, who reads all those guides, inspirational posts and infographics? Throw in a bunch of time-honored coupon codes and discounts – and you are in the hot seat! It’s no good knocking around – come along, place an order and get lost.
5.	Triggered email campaigns, personalized messages and email series are all beyond your depth! You’re not Forever21, right? Email marketing should boil down to order confirmations. Period. 
6.	Holiday design is nothing more than turkey and bells. Ok, and snowflakes. And Santa. There is just no point in all those brand color schemes and trendy designs. Customers come here to purchase, not contemplate.  
7.	A huge no-no is to in-store customer support, let alone 24/7 support, particularly in social media and messengers. Let your customers ponder on their misbehavior, rather than complain and demand. 
8.	Don’t sweat the small stuff like fast or free delivery, gift packages, warehouse inventory or product bundles – shoppers will purchase what they need anyways. Let it go.
9.	SEO, the hell is that? Drop it. What on earth is the point of rewriting product descriptions, doing keyword research, publishing specific blog posts and implementing redirects – thou who seek shall find! 
10.	Coupon codes and discounts are everything you will ever need. All those loyalty and rewards programs, bonus points, in-store credits and specials simply won’t fly. Don’t sweat it!
11.	Social media, the bane of the ecommerce industry. A fat lot of use they are. Stuff them with your products, coupon codes, discounts, deers and Santa. That’s that. What sweepstakes, what QA sessions and contests are you talking about? They purchased and… good riddance! 
12.	Don’t ever bother reading about any marketing tips and techniques for peak season retailers – not for the world! Don’t store your mind with trivial. And…

Three months ago I made a post asking for feedback about a website that I was starting (rupeerama.com) called: Reddit, do you think my online dollar store (free shipping on all products) is a good idea? 

I wanted to post a quick follow up post to provide an update to the community on how site is doing.

Rupeerama isn't doing bad. I have not seen the explosive growth I've hoped for, but acknowledge that it takes significant time to build a good organic online presence and a trusted brand. To date, I've been able to generate close to $2000 in sales from over 180 orders, from scratch. In processing these, I've started to learn how to better manage suppliers and customer expectations. A hurdle I continually face is shipping times, but customers seem to understand that in order to pay the price that they're paying for the product, something has to give. 

Site traffic isn't as high as I'd like it to be despite good conversion metrics. If anyone has good feedback on [freely-cheaply] driving good amounts of traffic, please share.

Social media presence is strong, with a good number of users and customers interacting through twitter and instagram a couple times a week.

My next areas of focus are:

Expanding the assortment to 1000+ products
Developing a ""marketplace"" where users can upload their own products
Investing in facebook and instagram ads to better understand ROI
The beginnings of scale

Reddit, if you have any feedback, please reach out! I've incorporated the past feedback that users have provided into the product that Rupeerama is today, thank you for that. 

The engines have been fired, it's time to start pushing the pedal.
