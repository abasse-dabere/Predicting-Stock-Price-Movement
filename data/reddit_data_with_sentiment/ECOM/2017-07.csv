ecommerce,Design feedback on e-commerce platform for YouTubers?,"Hey r/ecommerce,

I've been setting up the Beta version of an e-commerce platform I'm building.  I'd love any feedback on how to improve the design!

**URL**: https://www.idol8.com/

**Purpose**: An e-commerce marketplace that allows YouTubers to receive custom-video commissions from their fans.

**Technologies Used**: SquareSpace

**Feedback Requested**: I have no web dev experience at all, so I'd love any advice about how to make this site look more polished and professional. All feedback welcome!

**Comments**:  For the Beta, we will have 10-15 YouTuber stores set up, but I've only set up 2 stores at the moment. Could you please suggest how I might improve the look/UI of the site? Any general thoughts?

shopify,Tracking important metrics is KEY to succeeding in ecommerce. Here are the 10 essential metrics you need to measure and improve in order to grow your online store to 6-figures and beyond (I've also included suggestions on how you can begin optimizing these metrics!),"The best ecommerce entrepreneurs are obsessed with metrics. In fact, it’s this obsession with measuring and optimizing that allowed their stores to grow so fast.

However, they don’t optimize every single metric available.

Instead, they only optimize the right metrics.

What are these metrics?

Here are the [10 essential ecommerce metrics](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/ecommerce-metrics/) that will create a huge impact on your business when you track and optimize them.

**1. Sales Conversion Rate**

Here’s a simple example:

- Imagine you have 1,000 visitors coming to your website every month.
- Let’s assume that your conversion rate is only a measly 0.1%.
- Which means… out of every 1,000 visitors coming to your website, you’re only getting 1 sale!

What does that mean?

It means that you’re losing money every moment you do not optimize your conversion rate.

**Formula For Measurement:**

(# Of Sales) / (# of Users) x 100% = Conversion Rate

**How To Track:**

The best way to do this is to set up a Google Analytics goal.

**How To Improve:**

A - Use High Quality Images

A case study done by Visual Website Optimizer showed that larger, high-quality images improve sales.

Czech ecommerce retailer Mall.CZ improved their conversion rate by 9.46% after using larger product images with product description.

B - Add Trust Badges

Trust badges are badges that verify to visitors that a website is legitimate. The trust seal company (a 3rd party) collects data that confirms the website is authentic and not a scam.

Why is this important?

One of the key concerns a visitor has when first visiting your website is whether your website is legit. 

And trust badges help allay that anxiety.

Blue Mountain Media (a digital agency) improved their conversion rate by 42% after adding a simple VeriSign seal.  Virtualsheetmusic.com saw an increase in conversions by 31% by adding a VeriSign trust seal. And by adding a Norton Secured (SSL) trust mark, US Cutter, a supplier of vinyl cutting supplies increased their conversion by 11%.

C - Add Customer-Submitted Reviews

Has other people purchased this product before? Is it good? Will I be making a good decision in purchasing this product?

Help your customers by adding customer-submitted reviews to your product pages.

This allows them to read through and get affirmation that what they are doing is correct.

Express Watches improved their conversion rates by 58.29% simply by adding customer reviews to their product pages.

D – Add Live Chat

It’s proven: live chat increases conversion.

In one of Monetate’s test they conducted on ecommerce clients, adding live chat to their website increased the average order value by 3%. Another company, eztexting improved their conversion rate by 31% simply by adding live chat.

With the addition of live chat, potential customers can now communicate with customer service managers who can answer questions and close them.

E – Improve Your Value Proposition

The value proposition is the #1 reason why your customers come and buy from you. It should describe to him or her why they need you, and why they should choose you.

Improve your value proposition by making it crystal clear why they are there and how you can help them.

Pro-Tip: For more strategies to improve your conversion rate, check out this post on [ecommerce best practices](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/ecommerce-best-practices/).

-----------

**2. Website Traffic**

After you’ve taken the necessary steps to improve your conversion rate, it’s time to look at traffic.

Imagine these numbers:

- You have a 5% conversion rate.
- For every 1,000 visitors to your website, you are now making 50 sales (Wow!)
- And if you keep that number constant, the MORE visitors you drive to your website, the MORE sales you make!
- If you manage to get 10,000 visitors to your website, you’ll now have 500 sales!

**How To Track Traffic Stats**

You should be able to see your traffic stats from the ecommerce platform that you are using. For more information, check the Help Guides of your ecommerce platform.

**How To Get More Site Traffic**

A – Social Media

According to Gary Vaynerchuk, the Internet IS social media. No doubt, social media is a huge channel for entrepreneurs and marketers to leverage and reach their audience. 

Find out which platforms your customers are gathering at, and actively engage them there.

Pro-Tip: Here are [5 ADVANCED ways](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/social-media-ecommerce-traffic/) you can use social media to drive traffic to your store.

B – Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

“SEO is dead,” declared marketers after their websites got penalized by the almighty Google. 

Nope.  

SEO is not dead. Bad SEO is.

SEO is the art of “pleasing” search engines so that they will rank you higher. And as Google begins to refine their algorithm further, there are signs that they are now focusing on user experience (UX).

That means…. Good SEO is even more important than ever.

Good SEO is helping search engines do their jobs better. If you optimize your on-page SEO, create great content, deliver fantastic experience to your users, there IS no reason why Google will punish you.

Plus… It is estimated that a whopping 30.5% of all ecommerce traffic originates from search engine traffic.

If you’re not utilizing SEO… You’re missing out.

Pro-Tip: Here’s a guide on [how to increase search engine traffic](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-increase-search-traffic-to-your-ecommerce-site/) to your ecommerce store.

C – Influencer Marketing

Social media has empowered many individuals to build their personal brand and curate a huge following.

These people are known as influencers.

Influencer marketing is simply the process of building relationships with these influencers to get your products in front of their audience.

These influencers are trusted by their following to make good recommendations, and if you do this correctly — can drive huge amounts of traffic, social proof and sales to your online store.

Pro-Tip: Here are examples of how HUGE brands have leveraged [influencer marketing](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/influencer-marketing-examples/) to grow their businesses.

**3. Email Opt-In Conversion Rate**

Email marketing remains one of the most profitable channels you can pursue for your ecommerce store. In fact, email marketing has been shown to provide a 40X ROI over other channels, including social media.

Also, the side benefit of collecting the emails of your potential customers is the ability to control your audience.

If you build your business off Facebook, Instagram or Google, a single change in their algorithm or policies can bankrupt your business overnight. However, if you own a email list of your customers, you have the ability to sell them products over and over again without being punished.

That’s the power of email marketing.

**Formula For Email Opt-In Conversion Rate**

(# of emails opted in) / (# of users) x 100% = Email Opt-In Conversion Rate

**How To Track Opt-In Rate**

There are 2 ways in which you can do this:

A – The Manual Way

Every email service provider should be able to show you how many emails are opting in into your list daily.

B – The Automated Way

The second way to do this to set up a conversion goal. Head to Google Analytics, set up a conversion tracking goal by adding the tracking code to your “Opt-in Thank You Page”.

How To Improve Your Opt-In Conversion Rate

A – Add An Opt-In Offer

Give people a “carrot” to opt-in.

Instead of telling them to opt-in into your site for no reason (or “get updates”), tell them WHY they should opt-in to your site.

Here’s how SkinnyMint did it: [Image](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/skinny-mint-email-opt-in-600x340.png)

B – Ask For Emails More Aggressively

Now, by no means am I suggesting you to add opt-in boxes at every empty space you have in your website.

But you can definitely do better.

Some businesses bury their opt-in boxes at the footer of their website — which makes it hard for visitors to opt-in.

While you shouldn’t spam your visitors with opt-in boxes… You CAN become a little bit more assertive when it comes to asking for their emails.

You can…

Use a Welcome Gate: [Honest Company](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honest-company-welcome-gate-600x363.png) 

Or Exit Intent Pop-Up: [Image](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lumo-lift-opt-in-600x361.png)

C – Change Up Your Offer

Already offering something, but still getting poor opt-in rates?

Then your offer might not be something your target visitors want.

Try A/B testing your offer (most email tools should allow you to do this) and see which one performs better.

**4. Revenue By Traffic Source**

Famous advertiser John Wanamaker once quipped:

“Half the money I spent on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.”

Though this quote was made 100 years ago, it still rings true for many businesses today. 

We spend all our time, effort and money trying out different traffic sources, but have absolutely no idea whether they are working.

That’s why it is important that you track this metric known as “revenue by traffic source.”

Only by doing this will you be able to identify the traffic source that is working… so you can double down on it.

**How To Track**

If you have set up your ecommerce tracking properly (refer to Metric #1), you should be able to view this in your Google Analytics.

**How To Improve**

A – Stop Spending Money On Channels That Don’t Work

If you discover that there is a particular channel that isn’t delivering results to you, stop spending time and money on it.

Yes, even if that channel is utilized by ALL of your major competitors.

Why?

Because every company is unique in its makeup. By testing multiple channels, your job is to find the channels that is RIGHT for your company, not the channels that is used by everyone else.

If that channel isn’t working for you, abandon it and focus your efforts elsewhere.

B – Double-Down On Profitable Channels

Spot a traffic source that is way over-delivering on results? This is your chance.

Scale up that channel. Invest more money and time in it.

------------

**5. Customer Acquisition Cost**

What if every customer you acquire is making you a loss? What if you’re spending more to get a customer than what the customer is spending at your store?

Horrifying thought, yeah?

To prevent this problem, you must measure your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

Customer Acquisition Cost is the average expense of gaining one customer. This includes everything from marketing and sales expenses to salaries and overhead associated with attracting and converting a visitor to a customer.

**Formula For Customer Acquisition Cost**

(Total Sales and Marketing Expenses) / (# of Customers Acquired )= **Customer Acquisition Cost**

**Pro-Tip:** To calculate your CAC accurately, here’s a [good guide](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/customer-acquisition-cost/).

**How To Reduce Customer Acquisition Cost**

**A - Improve Your Sales Conversion Rates**

A higher conversion rate means that you’re converting more of your traffic into customers, which means getting more sales with the same number of visitors.

Spend the same and get more sales = YES!

We’ve already discussed how to improve your sales conversion rate in Metric #1, so simply hop back and take a look.

**B - Leverage Referrals and Word-of-Mouth**

If you can get every customer to refer one new customer to you, then give yourself a huge pat on your back.

Why?

Because you have effectively slashed your CAC by 50%!

Every successfully referred customer costs you NOTHING to acquire. All it takes is for a satisfied customer to tell his/her friends to spend at your store.

**C - Mix Up Paid Channels With Free Channels**

Paid marketing is great.

But it's not the only way to get traffic.

In fact, there are many free channels out there you can leverage to get more sales. You can choose from channels like:

- Social Media
- PR
- Online Communities, e.g Reddit
- Content Marketing

To reduce lower marketing costs, experiment with free channels to see if they can drive sales for you.

**D - Invest In Your Customers**

Your customers are your lifeblood of your business.

When you [invest in them and their satisfaction](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/customer-experience/), you increase their likelihood of recommending your store to their friends. You encourage them to make repeat purchases because they love you. 

Provide excellent customer service to make them happy. Help them make better, informed decisions. Make the entire purchase experience fantastic.

-----------

**6. Average Order Value**

According to ConversionXL, there are only 3 ways to grow a company:

- increase the number of customers,
- increase the average order size,
- increase the number of repeat purchases.

This is #2 of the THREE ways to do so.

Average Order Value is the average dollar amount a customer spends when they make a purchase from your website.

Imagine this:

- Online Store A drives 1,000 visitors a day to his store; while Online Store B only drives 100 visitors per day.
- Both stores have a 1% sales conversion rate, meaning A gets 10 sales/day and B gets 1 sale/day.
- Store A’s average order value is $20, while Store B’s average order value is $200.
- The result? Store A has a total revenue of $200, and Store B has a total revenue of $200 as well (despite having lesser traffic.)

Which means:

The more the customer purchases in a single order… the more profit you’ll be able to make.

**Formula For Average Order Value**

(Total Revenue) / (# of Orders Placed) = **Average Order Value**

**How To Improve Average Order Value**

**A - Upselling**

Upselling is the art of encouraging your customers to spend more than they had originally intended.

This includes:

- Making them buy something more expensive than the product they originally wanted.
- Buying something that complements their original purchase

Here are some examples of how to do upselling effectively:

Using different wording to make a more expensive product more lucrative:

Recommending products that will complement an existing purchase:

Bundle Sales:

**B - Offering Free Shipping For A Higher Purchase**

You could tempt your customer to add more products into their cart so that they would qualify for free shipping.

This is something Amazon excels at:

**C - Offer Discounts On Minimum Purchase**

Tell your customers that they could get a larger discount if they hit a minimum purchase target.

**D - Incentivize Them With A Freebie**

Tell them that they can get something free if they 1) buy the more expensive product or 2) hit a minimum purchase target.

----------

**7. Customer Lifetime Value**

According to Tech In Asia, the customer lifetime value (LTV) refers to the amount of money each customer is expected to spend on your products and services.

Why is this important?

Knowing your customer lifetime value will allow you to make several important business decisions. For example:

- If you know your customer LTV, you will then also know how much you are able to spend to acquire a customer. (It also means if you can increase your CLV, you can increase your CAC.)
- You will also know how much you are able to spend to service and retain that customer.

And so on.

**Formula For Customer Lifetime Value**

There are many ways to calculate the LTV of your customers. Here are [3 formulas](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-calculate-lifetime-value/?wide=1).

Confusing? It is. Here’s a [quick CLV calculator](http://www.clv-calculator.com/free-online-clv-calculators/online-clv-calculator/) you can use (warning: not for businesses with complicated CLV.)

**How To Increase Customer Lifetime Value**

**A - Increase Your Customer’s Average Order Value**

If your customers consistently order more at every single purchase, their lifetime value will increase.

**B - Build Long-Term Relationships With Your Customers**

When your customers love you, they are more loyal and more willing to buy more of your products. If they stay loyal to your brand, their customer lifetime value will increase.

Do this by being honest and transparent with your customers. Keep them updated on what's going on , and what's in the pipelines for you and your store.

You can also reward your best customers regularly and let them know you appreciate them. All of this help build loyalty to your store.

**C - Create Brand Loyalty**

While there are many detractors of the Apple fanbase, it remains true that Apple has created avid loyalists that will purchase anything they create.

How do you begin building a ""cult"" of fans like Apple, who are loyal to your cause?

While this is a huge article in of its own, here are some quick tips:

- Build high-quality products
- Invest in awesome customer service
- Make sure your branding efforts are consistent throughout all your marketing, product and design initiatives.

**8. Percentage Of Returning Customers**

Most businesses focus too much on getting new customers in the door -- and then neglecting people who are already customers.

Their journey doesn't end there.

After they have bought a product from you, they can buy _again and again and again_.

And it is better (and cheaper) for you to focus on your existing customers, as it costs 5x as much to acquire a new customer than to keep an old one.

**Formula For Percentage Of Returning Customers**

(# of Returning Customers) / (Total Customers) x 100% = **Percent of Returning Customers**

**How To Improve Customer Retention**

**A - Go The Extra Mile To Delight Your Customers**

Go the extra mile and make them love you. Deliver extraordinary service and surprise them occasionally. 

It can be something really small like a digital gift certificate or a personal handwritten Thank You note.

And research says it works - reciprocity is far more powerful when started by surprise.

[Warby Parker](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/warby-parker-marketing-story/) did something similar - replying customer questions on Twitter with personalized YouTube videos:

**Bonus Point:** The videos delighted their customers so much that it went viral!

**B - Implement A Customer Loyalty Program**

Reward customers for staying loyal to you. Encourage them to come back to your store often to redeem rewards, gifts and discounts.

**Pro-Tip:** Here are [31 loyalty program examples](https://www.candybar.co/blog/loyalty-program-examples/) you can model from!

**C - Send Regular Newsletter Emails**

Communicate with your customers often. Send regular email newsletters to inform them of upcoming sales, product releases, company updates and so on.

**D - Organize Meetups And Offline Events**

Want to build a better relationship with your customers?

Meet them face-to-face and build trust! You'll also be able to get important customer feedback lost during online communication.

In fact, this is how [Xiaomi](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/xiaomi-marketing-strategy/) grew to become such a huge smartphone company:

If offline events are tough to organize for your niche, then take a leaf out of Black Milk Clothing's book.

They created local Facebook groups and pages dedicated to buying and swapping their products -- and then participated in them.

----------

**9. Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate**

Shopping cart abandonment rate is the percentage of online shoppers who add items to a shopping cart and then abandoning it before completing the purchase.

Shocked that people do that?

Don’t be.

In fact, 68.63% of visitors abandon their shopping carts.

Why do they do so?

Here’s an idea of why:

Measure your shopping cart abandonment rate -- and then test different strategies for reducing it. 

**Formula For Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate**

1 - (# of completed purchases) / (# of shopping carts created) / 100 = **Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate**

#### **How To Track Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate**

Follow this exact [step-by-step guide](http://blog.lemonstand.com/cart-abandonment-google-analytics/) to learn how to set up Google Analytics to track Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate.

**How To Reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate**

**A -  Reduce distraction during the checkout page by removing everything else on the page. Let the customer check out smoothly.**

**B - Educate the customers about the number of steps required to finish the checkout.**

**C - Use remarketing to get them back to the cart**

**D - Send cart abandonment emails**

These are emails sent to your potential customer after they abandon the cart. The purpose of these emails is to get them to come back and complete the cart.

### **Ecommerce Metric #10: Net Promoter Score**

&gt; ""If 40% of your users say they will be very disappointed without your product, you have attained product-market fit."" - Sean Ellis, Founder, Growthhackers.com

Although Sean meant it in the context of product-market fit, it is still important to measure customer satisfaction no matter which stage of business you're in.

Why?

Because the true measure of a long-lasting brand is how much its customers love and support them.

So how do you measure customer satisfaction?

Use Net Promoter Score (NPS).

The NPS is a very simple survey that measures how likely a customer is to recommend your brand to a friend.

#### **Formula For Net Promoter Score**

The NPS is calculated based on the rating to one single question:

“On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company’s product or service to a friend or a colleague?”

Then, based on this rating, customers are classified in 3 categories:

**A - Detractors**

People who give a score lower or equal to 6. They are not excited about the product or serviec and will likely not purchase again.

**B - Passives**

People who give a score of 7 or 8. They are somewhat satisfied but may skip to a competitor if the opportunity arises.

**C - Promoters**

People who give a score of 9 or 10. These are people who love the company’s products and will evangelize the company by repeatedly purchasing and recommending it.

#### **How To Track Net Promoter Score**

Whilst you can physically send an email to all your customers to do the NPS, it’s better if you automate the entire process using available tools.

Tools that are available include:

- Customer.guru
- Promoter.io
- Delighted
- Wootric
- AskNicely
- SatisMeter

#### **How To Improve Net Promoter Score**

**A - Reach Out To Detractors And Passives After The Survey**

People who have answered your survey are people who have taken the time out to show you their dissatisfaction.

As much as you dislike to hear it, who better than to talk to provide valuable feedback on how to improve your products and services?

Reach out to them and find out what exact problem they are facing. If it’s a small issue and solvable, do it. If it’s larger, take note of it and promise to fix it.

You’ll be surprised how effective this is in turning your detractors and passives into promoters.

**B - Reward Your Promoters**

Promoters who love you are a sign that you’re  doing well. Make them even more loyal to your store by rewarding them.

**The story so far**
It's been a busy few months, having expanded from Amazon FBA to creating my own site.  I've spent a lot of time learning from r/ecommerce and similar subs, as well as reading a ton of related books.
Trouble is, despite all the reading, and doing my best to incorporate as much as humanly possible into it from all the advice I've found on the sub, I've had no orders so far from the site.
I've tried some adwords, and various bits of social media marketing, and I'm getting some traffic, but no actual paying customers yet...  I wondered if only having Paypal as a payment option was what was putting people off, so have added 'Pay with Amazon' too.
I figured, rather than spend a ton of money on advertising a site that isn't converting, I'd ask you folks for your educated opinion first.

I'm fairly Internet and computer savvy and would say I have a fair general idea in what to do, but where I get stumped is:  
  
Shipping:  
like how should I be packaging things to be mailed appropriately, how to determine the correct type of mailing (I've honestly never really posted anything but a letter in my life), how to determine the costs of shipping, how to incorporate the shipping cost into the price of the item, how to make sure I'm not accidentally screwing myself over with the costs, etc.  
I should add that I'm pretty useless with math. As long as it can be done on a calculator I'm sweet.  
Websites/apps:  
where should I sell my items, what websites/apps are decent, what to stay away from, etc  
Advertising/description/promotion:  
the only thing I really do know is that my pictures for the items need to be well done and I'd like to have them on a human than on a hanger. I have no idea how to write product descriptions or what to mention such as, if I should take measurements of the items and include them in the description.

dropship,Starting from nothing to a store launch and first sale in two weeks: drop shipping first impressions.,"I stumbled upon this sub two weeks ago and was really intrigued by the concept of drop shipping. I’ve since started a store I really like and I’d like to share some first impressions. I started the store mostly to learn about supply chains and social marketing. Also, I figured I could throw away ~$1,000 on gambling options trades or I could invest in an actual business I could control. Finding a niche was easy for me. I have some hobbies that I’ve been doing a long time and I was excited to 1) Find products that I personally want to buy and 2) Help other people find these products as well. I also have a lot of built-up natural content related to my hobbies that are a great fit for the store.


In one day, I managed to start my LLC, apply for copyrights, buy a domain, select 100 products from different suppliers, and build a theme. I really wanted to protect my brand name and image from the start. Even if I don’t break even on these upfront expenses, it continues to amaze me just that I was able to build this global foundation simply from my couch.


The next day, I spent time organizing the products and suppliers. I hired a graphics designer and a SEO person from two totally different countries on fiverr for cheap (and they’ve been doing a great job). Then, I decided I wanted a business address different from my house for some privacy, to give the impression of a brick and mortar store, and to handle any potential returns. Luckily, I have a buddy that owns some random shops around town and he let me drill a mailbox to one of his warehouses that says “Suite 101”.


The next few days were spent casually adding/removing/refining products, consolidating suppliers, adding content, and signing up for small misc. things like analytics, social media accounts, bank accounts, local taxes, etc.


By July 4, I was ready for a soft opening and launched the site. My goal was to get some initial followers and interest using the morning of the holiday (when I figured a lot of people would be looking at their phones). I played around with facebook boosting some posts, removing boosts, changing audiences, etc. for $6 and I made a sale. I like that you can stop a post from boosting and use the balance on something new mid-campaign.


So here are my first impressions:


1)      I really don’t see how facebook ads can be sustainable for a small business. By the time the afternoon comes on the east coast, the site is flooded with ads. If the feed refreshes, you can’t even get back to an ad you saw previously in your feed without searching for it. At $3/day to boost a single post, this seems crazy.


2)      However, there seems to be an effective way to “hijack” fb ads. I noticed that when I shared posts from other companies related to my niche that I was basically getting free advertising. For example, an NFL team might boost a post for a month straight at a substantial cost and there may be 5-10 shares on the post. Anyone can see who shared the post. So, if I sell footballs and I share a NFL post that has thousands of comments on it- it is a really easy way to get my brand out there.


3)      I don’t see how violating Reddit’s TOS is sustainable either (e.g., by vote manipulating). Sure, you could make some quick money with targeted campaigns, but I don’t see how this is good for your brand name over time. Eventually, your brand name will be labeled in Reddit simply as spam and eventually you will run out of niche ideas.


4)      There was a lot more manual work involved with my first sale than I expected. Meaning, I had to mark the sale as paid, buy it on aliexpress, set up an aliexpress account, manually enter credit card information, manually change shipping information, add the tracking information to oberlo, etc. Perhaps all of this was necessary because it was my first sale, but doing this for even 100 orders would be awful.


5)      Several friends and other local business owners that have seen my store are impressed and don’t realize how straightforward it is to setup; to the extent that they would like me to develop their own store. I know people sell these services online to people already aware of this model, but it might be worth your while to approach local businesses about setting up an online presence if you are in need of steady income (and it may just help your local economy).


6)      For my own store, I think my best approach moving forward will be to partner with blogs in my niche that have a lot of existing followers. There are a couple of obvious solutions to doing this: send free products to a blog to review or host blog content in my store in exchange for product placement. But maybe there are other partnership business structures I am missing?

ecommerce,Dropship Question,"Hi beautiful people,

I order from aliexpress often for myself. Thinking about drop shipping niche products. But, when they deliver the items in the little packets, it usually says 'value' price for the item.

For example, I ordered a seat cover, it said its worth 2 dollars when I paid a bit more.

ecommerce,How would you go about this?,"I have a pretty decent opportunity to make some extra money. I work for a chemical supply company and can get stuff dirt cheap, like cheaper than anyone else you would find online. We basically supply companies, that supply other smaller companies, so we're at the top of the food chain as far as variety and distribution goes. 

I don't really want to get into hazmat yet, at least not until I'm more familiar with the laws, and licenses that I will need.

So at this moment I have a few options. 

I can sell non-haz materials and ingredients to small businesses that make their own bath products (Bath Bombs, Soaps, Body Scrubs, etc.)

I can choose to make my own bath products and cosmetics. 

Or I can do both at the same time.

I dont want to get in over my head though because I'm alone on this at the moment. I also never sold anything online before. 

I was thinking about starting small, selling ingredients to people, that way I can gain some rep and get somewhat of a steady income to put towards manufacturing. I just dont know if I should focus on 1 brand for everything or if I should keep the supply business separate from the bath products business. 

If I do start selling actual bath products, I would like to offer kits to people that like to diy their own stuff. 

I feel like this is a great opportunity. I just dont know where to start or even how to go about running a business in general.

Should I go right into it and create a name, tax id, and an official website? Or should I kind of go off the books for a little while, selling on eBay and etsy just until I make some money to reinvest into something more official?",8,6,2017-07-07,ECOM,0.02566530369222164,0.9397186636924744,0.034616075456142426

dropship,Dropshipping site Woocommerce site giveaway,"Hey all, 

This is a bit of a long shot but I've got a site developed and live that I've never thrown any adspend towards and am completely over running (I never really did anything with it other than use it as a sandbox to do some custom development on the Woocommerce checkout for my other sites.)

I want to give it away to someone who has a genuine interest in either extreme sports or gadgets (it's a 360 degree camera site).

I designed it to be 100% drop shipped products, all off Aliexpress. It's going to need a bit of work (things like optimising images and videos) as it's running a bit slow currently.

It's been live for about 10 months now and I want to find someone to either give a dump of the php database and files, or sign the current hosting over to completely. 

Why? I just don't want to see it go to waste as I've put a decent amount of time into it and it looks pretty good. I've got too much on my plate to run it (I am a digital marketer by trade and I already have other ecomm sites on the side). I never put any advertising to it but I believe it's a pretty cool niche that can draw some revenue. 

Let me know in the comments why you'd like to be gifted it - I don't want to hear from any ""I haven't had a job for 12 months and I've got 6 kids"" kinds of people. I would rather give it to someone who is hungry to learn or expand their drop shipping network.

woocommerce,Enabling price filter for your price altering plugin,"So recently we were checking out wholesale pricing plugins for a client. Every plugin we checked had the same problem. Everything worked as far as cart updating prices and catalogue display, setting user to be wholesale (via role), but the price filter widget that comes with Woo seemed to ignore the wholesale pricing...

We checked into the code and found a nice splodge of SQL. Of course pricing filters cannot be used if you're checking SQL, so we looked for a filter for the meta-value and sure enough found `woocommerce_price_filter_meta_keys`

If you author one of these wholesale plugins, or have a site constrained by such limits, here is the code for how we fixed for fixed price. All you basically have to do is return an array of suitable values as a list of meta-keys.) Also I don't care if you bundle this with your theme, or plugin, I just think it's not ideal none of the plugins we found (top of wp plugin index for term ""wholesale woo""), written for WooCommerce use this filter.

    function use_wholesale_price_in_woocommerce_price_filter($meta_keys = []) {
        /* the implementation of the below function doesn't matter as it will be different for each of your plugins
           if in-doubt add a capability 'wholesale_user', and just make it check for that user capability */
        if(is_wholesale_user()) {
            $meta_keys[] = '_whatever_the_meta_field_for_wholesale_price_is';
        }
        return $meta_keys;
    }
    add_filter('woocommerce_price_filter_meta_keys', 'use_wholesale_price_in_woocommerce_price_filter');

    function is_wholesale_user() {
        return current_user_can('whatever cap or role you give to wholesale users (try not to use wp or woo built-in caps)');
    }

    function wholesale_custom_price_filter_query($args=[]) {
        if(is_wholesale_user()) {
          unset($args['price_filter']); // remove existing price_filter

          $min = isset( $_GET['min_price'] ) ? floatval( $_GET['min_price'] ) : 0;
          $max = isset( $_GET['max_price'] ) ? floatval( $_GET['max_price'] ) : 9999999999;

          $args['price_filter'] = [
            'relation' =&gt; 'OR',
            'price_filter' =&gt; true,
            []
          ];
          foreach(apply_filters('woocommerce_price_filter_meta_keys', ['_price']) as $field) {
            $args['price_filter'][] = [
              'key'     =&gt; $field,
              'value'   =&gt; array( $min, $max ),
              'compare' =&gt; 'BETWEEN',
              'type'    =&gt; 'NUMERIC',
            ];
          }
        }
        return $args;
    }
    add_filter('woocommerce_product_query_meta_query', 'wholesale_custom_price_filter_query', 10);

This is literally all we do, it fixes the problem we had. It doesn't make any attempts to deal with % based discounts (why calculate this, and not just store the % and the updated flat-price value on save of the product?)

Hopefully this will help someone, if not, I might submit to the plugin directory as a lightweight reference plugin augment plugin. Sure we could roll our own, but that seems like a lot of effort, would increase our responsibilities, and isn't playing well with others.

**Update:** Looks like it was split between two plugins; I've brought the other plugin in too. Essentially the WooCommerce system should have a for-each to enable multiple pricing fields. It doesn't so we make it play nice. What would be gold is a way to instead of say OR, say if there is no wholesale meta key use standard price. We also do not want to calculate based upon price exclusive of tax in any circumstances, but modify as you will for your own plugin.

**Update 2:** Looks like price ordering also needs to be altered. It should be a reasonable expectation that even with discounts, any item that is cheaper should always be cheaper. Probably need to hook the `woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args` too to undo any naive sort by price logic.",0,3,2017-07-08,ECOM,0.07367711700499058,0.8900833129882812,0.036239597015082836

We are having trouble on creating a sales funnel. I have gathered some data from paid ads on Facebook, last week we paid 35 dollars over 7 days and got 57 clicks to the site. None of them converted.

They are probably interested but not ready to buy. We got very good reactions from the ad, lots of likes and comments on it.

ecommerce,[Review] Having issues making conversions.,"Some friends and I started a company last year selling underwear with pockets.

We launched in September and had some online success from paid advertisements on Google and Facebook through to Christmas. We took a break from advertising after this and worked slowly towards building our brand. Things slowed and started to look a bit bleak, but In March with did an Outdoor Travel Show and had great success. 

Since the show we have put about $600 into paid advertisements on mostly Facebook and some Google with 0 conversions. I'm not experienced in online marketing so my approach has been to throw things at the wall and hope something will stick then build off that, this unfortunately has not happened. I have targeted many different things, from 'women 50-60 just returning from a trip with a male friend with a birthday in 2 weeks' to 'men 30-50 who are fans of pages about diabetes' (apparently the pocket is a great place for an insulin pump at night). I've tried broad and niche demographics with nothing sticking. This has caused us to wonder if the lack of conversions is perhaps from our website.

I have now rebuilt the site, the approach is similar but I've streamlined some of the content. Since the minor rebuild I was keen on finally seeing conversions... still nothing. I've had Google ads running as well as our usual clicks from Facebook and Instagram posts. 

Sorry I've been ranting so much, this is the first time I've reached out for help, hopefully I haven't overloaded anyone with information. 

I'd love it if people could take a look at the site and let me know what they think, how a purchaser would see the site/product, and if there are any glaring issues you can see that would warrant our conversions.

Any help is hugely appreciated.

ecommerce,Legal questions regarding trademarks and domains,"I have a domain name that I have had for years and never used, let's call it ""Industries"" and its kind of like my favorite name for a company. I have just recently started using it as a platform to blog and promote all my random ventures in ecommerce and other areas. 

I did a google search to see if the site was showing up and it is along with my Facebook page and logo! However, I stumbled across another company that has the same name with an INC at the end located in CA (I'm in WI). They have a trademark on a sketched design and use it to sell socks and other apparel with this one design that I would never want to use. This one design is assigned to ""Industries INC"" but they don't use their own name as a website and have no active Facebook or social media under Industries INC but are instead using Indus Sock's.

Are there any issues with me keeping my domain/company name down the road? I do some t-shirt design but nothing major and will never sell socks. I'd rather break ties with my favorite domain sooner than later as I'm just starting to build up the blog and site.

shopify,Just got kicked from Shopify Payments for selling Disney and Marvel merchandise! Help!,"A little background:

Last year I converted my comic and video game store's inventory over to Shopify in order to launch a webstore. 15,000 items, 4 months, and lots of money later, we made the conversion and everything was more or or less fine on the Shopify side. Nice site, easy to use, etc.

Then a couple of weeks ago we receive an email from Shopify's risk team asking for proof of authorized reseller status for Disney and Marvel merchandise. Fine right? At first they say that invoices count, so we provide our invoices from our distributors, our tax ID number, and mercantile license. They then say it's not good enough and we need a written agreement between us and Disney and Marvel. The only problem is, no such thing exists as far as I can find. I contact Diamond Comics, our main distributor for inventory and the only distributor for comics in North America and they don't understand what Shopify is asking for either. Comic shops are not required to obtain permission from brand holders to sell these items as far as they know. I even contact Marvel Comics and get a hold of their VP of sales. Even he isn't familiar with any such agreements existing. This isn't about IP use or IP licensing to produce products, which of course requires an agreement and has easily located application processes online. This is about reselling merchandise that is available through distributors and manufacturers that carry Disney and Marvel items (not Alibaba!).

Long story short, Shopify removes our ability to use Shopify Payments until we can provide proof. This is how we process cards in the store and online, and Shopify is our entire platform at this point.

Can anyone help? Does anyone have an example of such an agreement and how they obtained it? I'm not looking for a similar agreement with a brand like Nike or Chanel, I know they have application processes for authorized resellers. Disney and Marvel do not have any such application, again, as far as I can find. Shopify was unable to provide any examples of any agreements with Disney and put the blame on Stripe, saying it was their policy and they were being hammered with fines for stores selling Disney merchandise.

I have a feeling they're attempting to crack down on bootleg merchandise and in the process catching legitimate retailers like myself who only carry official products obtained through distributors. Amazon has a similar policy, but they have a brand verification process that we have been able to follow just fine that includes using authorized suppliers as proof.

Once they're fitted perfectly, they're protective, they stay in your mouth, you can talk and breathe. But if you fit it incorrectly, it's providing little to no protection and its uncomfortable. Despite this, some people (especially kids) will still wear horribly fitted guards from us because its better than their last guard. Or they'll say the guard doesn't work and leave a bad review.

dropship,Started my store this month -- made $447.60 yesterday!,"Proof: http://i.imgur.com/NDvfKag.png

Obviously, I didn't pocket all of it. 

I spent $125 in FB ads and $136.84 in product costs -- so I came out with $185.76 in profit once everything was calculated.

Yeah, this probably doesn't sound like much to a lot of you out there, but I'm proud of it! And I'd say it's not bad for having my store up for less than a month.

Anyway, I've been a lurker here for a little bit and I noticed a lot of you guys have trouble with picking a niche, generating sales, or just making your store/brand look appealing.

So I wanna share some of my insights and things I've learned over these past 2 weeks on my journey to hopefully help you with yours.

&gt; ## Details of my business:

* **This is NOT my first store:** I've had 3 stores prior to this and although I was able to generate sales (usually within the first few days of having them up) none of them were really profitable. So this is my FIRST real PROFITABLE one. 

* **I use the Shopify / Oberlo combo:** I just like how it's mostly automated and I don't have to do much work.

* **This is a GENERAL store:** But I have pockets (or categories) of niches within this store -- and all of my FB ad targeting is to specific niches.

* **Although this is a general store, I DO have branding in place:** The stuff that StiffnHard guy has been posting around this subreddit is GOLD. Listen to what he says. Branding is hugely important when it comes to eCommerce -- especially with all the shitty dropshipping sites that are popping up nowadays.

* **I use the ""FREE, Plus Shipping"" model:** If you don't know what that is, it's basically where you sell a product for 'free' but make the profit with the shipping costs (I charge $9.97). I do have 'retail' products that I sell, too. But I use my ""Free, Plus Shipping"" items to get people into my sales funnel. 

* **My profits are somewhat consistent:** I've been trying to scale hard these past few days but before that I've had consistent sales and profits from the get-go (and by this I mean, when I put a certain amount into the ad spend, I came out with a proportionate amount of profit).

* **I only use Purchase conversions for my FB ads:** I've tested a few other objectives but they don't work as well as Purchase conversions (this is mainly because Facebook will send you different types of people first in your audience depending on the objective -- for example, if you choose PPE, Facebook will at first mainly show your ads to people who are most likely to engage with your ad, then once it's hit everyone in that audience it'll move onto the other groups of people in that audience).

* **My ""Free, Plus Shipping"" profit margins are razor thin so I make the most money through UPSELLS:** So get yourself an upsell app ASAP. I recommend Boost Sales by Beeketing.

* **I offer a super generous guarantee and my customer service is second to none:** I also eat up any of the costs that my customers might have to incur because I honestly believe customer retention is way more important than customer acquisition. So I will always take the little loss as long as I make my customers happy. Of course, there are some that'll just be a complete pain in the ass, but those aren't the customers you want anyway. 

* **The apps I have installed on my site:** Boost Sales, Abandonment Protector Plus, Conversio, Google Shopping, MailChimp, Oberlo, Pixel Perfect, Product Reviews &amp; Product Reviews Addon, Tracktor.


So those are just the quick details of my business before I go any further.

Now, I know I'll get a lot of hate for this, but I actually 'learned' how to create a successful eCommerce store from gurus. 2 of them, to be specific. One of them was Ben Malol and the other was Adrian Morrison. 

I won't lie, I was sucked into their courses after I saw their ads on FB (but, fortunately, I didn't spend a single penny on them *cough cough*). At first, I thought these guys were bullshit. But then I actually tried out what they taught and I started making sales. 

And now I'm here finally growing a business that makes me money. It almost feels like it's not real lol.

Anyway, lemme hit you with some random tips or things I've learned:

&gt; ## Tips &amp; Trix:

* **Don't cheap out with your suppliers on AliExpress:** I did that a few days ago because the supplier had a 'cheaper' price, but it ended up biting me in the ass. Because even though the supplier's product page said they ship with ePacket, they ended up shipping all of my orders through China Post. So I had to take a loss on that and ship out all the items again using a different supplier with ePacket. (If you do see a supplier offering free ePacket, PLEASE make sure to contact them and ask them if they really do send it out with ePacket. This will save you a ton of headaches.)

* **Create a second account on AliExpress and VERIFY YOUR IDENTITY WITH ALIPAY ASAP:** This deserves an all caps because once you do start generating sales, AliExpress will flag your account as fraudulent, especially if you're new, and won't let you order anything. This happened to me, but fortunately I had a second account on hand that I could fulfill orders with. I then verified my identity through AliPay and through the appeal process (which, weirdly only pops up once you've been flagged), and now I'm good to go.

* **When running your ads, don't just increase the budget of your successful ad set:** For some reason, this makes the results all wonky. I think it might be because Facebook takes a couple of days to optimize your ad set for the budget you set it at -- so if you randomly increase your budget it'll use that same optimization for a higher budget which will throw it off course. Or it might just be placebo. I dunno. But it's always better to be on the safe side. So, instead of increasing your budget, DUPLICATE THE AD SET, then increase the budget of that new ad set. 

* **Filter your Facebook pages:** Because of the inherent nature of dropshipping (aka your higher prices than average), there's going to be a lot of shitposters. So filter your FB page to automatically hide comments that have certain keywords in them. If you want, I can send you the list of keywords I specifically use. 

* **Your sales won't be uphill 100% of the time:** Certain days will generate more sales while others will make you panic and think your business is doomed. Saturdays are the worst for me. Thursdays are fucking amazing (I actually made the $447.60 on Thursday hehe). 

* **For my niches, I like to pick ones where the majority of the demographic is around ages 30 - 65+:** Why? Because older people have more money. Plus, they're less tech and promotion savvy, so they're usually the ones who like to take advantage of my ""Free, Plus Shipping"" offer. 

* **When you pick your niche, choose people who are PASSIONATE or people who IDENTIFY with a group:** You want to sell passion products or sell products that help people identify with the group they want to be identified with, if that makes sense. For instance, I'm an entrepreneur so I'll like products that make me identify as an entrepreneur -- that may be a book on business/marketing, a shirt that has an entrepreneuric (is that a word?) quote, or just something along those lines. Passion products are similar, except instead of it being an identity, it's just something that I love. For example, I love playing PS4 and I will buy up just about any PS4 game that looks half decent (I probably spend thousands every month on games alone). 

* **Don't be discouraged if you don't generate any sales:** It's a numbers game. But, not only that, you need to TEST, TEST, TEST. Heck, even before choosing a niche for your store, you should be TESTING which niches are profitable. A lot of your ads and products are gonna fail, but that's normal. What you want to do is fail quickly (and preferably cheaply), so you can move on to find the profitable products/niches.

* **Run test ads at $5/day before scaling:** Start CHEAP. Don't dump hundreds and hundreds into advertising without first validating your products/niches. Of course, if you sell a higher priced item, you can afford to spend more on testing, but the principle is the same. Test quick and cheap. 


That's about all I can think of off the top of my head.

woocommerce,Is WooCommerce a viable platform to allow users to sell their things online for a fixed fee?,"Hi all,

I want to create a website for local classified ads. I'm planning to start it as an MVP, so functionality will be as follows:

- Sign Up,
- User Accounts,
- Upload Products, images and assign categories
- Product gets listed for set amount of days (depending on fixed price - higher gets product listed for longer)
- Search for Products,
- Filter Products
- Display Products with seller's basic contact details

I'm pretty sure this is possible with Woocommerce, but is it viable? I'll be continuing to add and build functionality onto the site into the future, and it may get pretty custom, so I'm also considering the alternatives. Perhaps Laravel would be more well-suited?

So my question is, because it isn't anything I would need to look into...... is who does the graphic design/logos for you as a drop shipper? Are most of you doing it yourself? Where do you look to hire help? Is there a need for a freelancer/company that would target these start-up businesses? I know most of you run ads on Facebook, but are you also managing the account itself (posts,likes, shares, comments,etc)?

Xposted to r/dropship hence why the question is drop shipping geared but I'm curious about all startup businesses.

ecommerce,Would Appreciate Feedback on Niche Ecom Site,"Hi, 

TL:DR - what's wrong with my site www.swathecollective.com

A little background - I'm recently unemployed (left job, moved cities to be with my husband) with a background in economic consulting (very left brain, right brain is sadly.. so weak) 

In a nutshell, decided to try my hand at selling clothes online that I purchase wholesale. I picked maxi dresses as a niche. I'm super private and basically a clueless caveman when it comes to social media but am focused on the economics of the business which might be to my detriment. I don't want to invest too much $$ in inventory without seeing if this thing has legs, but on the flip side, maybe no one wants to buy anything from a site that has only 12 styles of dresses. Chicken or egg?

My big questions:
1) Do you think I need more inventory
2) Do you think I need to invest in professional pics (ones on site are provided by my wholesaler)
3) I added fake ""sold out"" styles to beef up the site, but I think it might be annoying. Thoughts?
4) I anecdotally hear that lots of people are doing these kinds of sites (boutique clothing resale)  and ""killing it"" mainly through IG following etc. Heard the same?

In fact, there is nothing - just a header/foot. The rest is just a WYSIWYG edit. Is that normal? It seems odd that I cannot drag/drop a new section in. I also don't see the ""add section"" button. Nothing but the header/footer.

Thanks for helping a noob out!!

dropship,"My store has almost 1k in sales in 12 days, but I have run into a problem...","Hi guys, 

I started my first dropshipping store, took about 2 months building the site and finding my products and suppliers.

I've surprised myself and had some very early success, in 12 days since launching I have just under 1k in sales and counting.

However, my problem is this:

The last few orders my supplier has shipped have come with tracking numbers that have my customers' packages going to the wrong address.  I have reached out to the supplier for further clarification but have not gotten a response.


My orders up to this point have gone flawlessly, quickly shipped to the correct address.  I have read on some other forums that aliexpress suppliers sometimes make mistakes pairing the correct tracking number to the correct order, i'm hoping this is the case.


My question is, has anyone had any similar problems?  Any packages sent to the wrong address?  Any wrong tracking numbers given but the package was actually delivered to the correct address?

If so how have you handled this?  I have more orders coming in and am getting discouraged this will continue to be a problem, especially due to the fact that my supplier seems to be no where to be found when it comes to answering my questions.


Also, I have an order that should have arrived to my customer by now, the tracking number said it was delivered yesterday but to the wrong address.  Should I reach out to this customer and ask if they received their package, also debating how exactly to word that email.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and reply.

ecommerce,WooCommerce art store - feedback and impressions,"Hi Reddit,
I've built a site from scratch for my wife to start selling her artwork online (she's had reasonable success at craft fair's and at a small area she rents out of brick and mortar store but no such luck online).

I've recently moved it from a crappy shared hosting platform to a VPS and I think that's dealt with a lot of woes I had in terms of performance/loading times and sometimes errors or unavailable. But as much as I seem to optimize I can't seem to make progress with end user's getting to the cart very often, let alone a conversion.

I've dabbled with all the usual advertising methods to drive some traffic - a bit of SEO etc but feel like I'm out of touch in terms of eCommerce and modern talk of landing pages etc. My own views are likely biased but I think the site is functional, relatively simple to navigate and looks ok - (although i do accept mobile/dynamic site for smaller screens could do with some work).

Would appreciate some general feedback on look and feel - and any advice on how to get people further along in conversion chain or even make conversions. Product is very Niche so that could be half the issue - I've just not found the right visitors yet. But would expect a little more (have analytics etc to track) add to carts from some of the targeted stuff we've been doing.

Concerned that we need more images of artwork and more ""sales speak"" without being sure how to go about it.

I am in the process of creating a store through Shopify, although I plan to purchase a new domain name, soon after I add inventory and products to my site. To start off, we are in the Hats and Embroidery Business and have been for the past 20 years. 

Because technology has cut traffic in retail stores and in malls, where our store is currently located, Shopify is the next chapter. So let me explain my problem and quesitons, in hopes for a helpful collection of answers and advice: 

1) I am currently in the process of the ""free trial"" so does this prohibit me from creating a new page easily? I am not familiar with coding. 

2) I want to add a catalog inside of the main menu which takes the user to a new page that narrows down their search by including different links such as ""team hats"" ""design hats"" ""kids hats"" ""custom hats"" etc. But I am not sure how to efficiently create that subsection without purchasing any kind of service. If Possible. 

3) Is it possible to shift the sidebar onto the top of the site? Or do I have to use a different theme? (i am using SIMPLE - the free theme)

4) Because we are also offering a custom option, embroidering, could you guys recommend any kind of help that would make the experience the best possible system for the customer? Including an ""upload"" button, ""Fonts &amp; Size"" options, etc. (Of course, we will disclose that the logo or design they'd like will have to be approved to avoid any copyright infringement conflicts"".

2. As for the prices, I have no idea how I've priced some of that stuff because I was using the rule of 3. Is there any way to be notified when the sellers on Aliexpress change their prices?

3. I had a blog related to this store but it was hosted on Wordpress so I could see if there were any views, as you know you can't check that on Shopify and I do not know how to use the Google analytics. I have worked on the blog and now I am not sure if I keep them both or not. For now, the same posts are scheduled on both sides...

woocommerce,Square for WooCommerce,"So, we have decided to implement Square for WooCommerce at one of our 5 facilities for the remainder of the year as a 'test run' of sorts. The benefit of connecting our online store to our brick and mortar location is huge for us. And, the fact that there is no contract or monthly charge for service other than card processing, is a big plus too. 

Now, here's my 1 problem:
We are a golf management company with multiple courses. 

- I have used WooCommerce Bookings some and it's an okay, out of the box option. I can see it working for one golf course, but not the 5 we will eventually have on this platform. 
- Square bookings is a friendly interface, but definitely limited in what it can actually do. 
- I looked into Scheduleicity and I'm having a hard time believing it can do what we we need. 

So, does anyone know of  really good booking software or plugin that can be used for golf courses? Or, am I better of developing this aspect on my own and copyrighting it?

&gt;Along with Games development team i do have team/company which is dedicated to web/mobile applications development and also mainly marketing.we tested and gained profits.

&gt;Now we have decided to make it a business model.

&gt;How this works?

&gt;&gt;These sites need legitimate reviews and positive feedbacks from real customers without fraud. We can get 100 positive reviews for 5products i.e 500 reviews in 3,4months or even in less time.

&gt;Are we doing this already?

&gt;We doing it in India and also USA,USA stores have huge returns.

&gt;Indian store latest snapshots of sales below!!

&gt;One month sales



                             &gt;&gt;Almost 3 lakhs   INR in a month














&gt;10 months revenue 



                                   &gt;&gt;18 lakhs change INR in 10months



&gt;What we observed in Indian store is that there is lot of return policy and refund/cancelation request.



&gt;&gt;USA stores have less cancellations and headache and have constant sales and increases as reviews grow.
We have a dedicated team who look after store needs like:

&gt;Looking after products

ecommerce,Where did you start?,"I have recently purchased the necessary machinery to manufacture a product. 

I have no prior experience so my intention is to create a few different designs of my product and list them on ebay. 

Simultaneously, I intend to list the products on Shopify or some similar ecommerce website. However, at this stage I do not intend to invest in any form of advertisement. 

My plan is to see how the ebay listings go while I build up designs and inventory. Then once I have a decent sized catalogue on the website and have a feel of what sells, I will invest in targeted advertisement. 

My concerns now are:

- being new to ebay I can only list 10 products per month. I can increase this by paying a monthly rate to becoming a verified ebay store but at this stage I don't think it's necessary until the sales begin. 

- my product is related to a niche topic and I don't think Facebook advertising will benefit greatly. Rather I plan to advertise on forums related to my topic. Am I likely to get better results this way? 

Obviously there isn't much of a plan here but I'd like to hear any input. 

Where did you start. What recommendations do you have and what changes would you make if you could do it from the start?",2,4,2017-07-21,ECOM,0.017168229445815086,0.9085911512374878,0.074240542948246
ecommerce,Looking for a simple online catalog with buy now (external link) button,"I'm looking for something that can produce a catalog page similar to [THIS page](http://imgur.com/Uh9oU3f) where it has the ""buy on amazon"" and ""buy on google"" buttons.

A free wordpress theme would be ideal for what I need this for, and have found catalog extensions, but that button is a $50 add-on.  The site I am doing is just going to serve as a catalog of sorts, and the button will take the viewer to the page on a different website where they can order an item, so each button link will be different depending on what item they are looking at (so not just a button with a link that is copied on to all pages).

2. If someone buys it , do i email them again with the info of the buyer and they send the product? and also i give them the wholesale cost? do i send the wholesale cost manually?

3. Does all the work is done manually with emails and contacts etc or is there a way to automate the process?

dropship,Questions on picking a supplier (I use Oberlo-Shopify),"New to this, and I have many questions for picking a supplier. I'm using the Oberlo/Shopify combo. I'm looking at Aliexpress and Oberlo Supply for potential suppliers. I know some of my questions are pretty basic, but I'd love to know everything that you think I should know about all these. So, my questions are:

1. How do you choose a good supplier from Aliexpress?
2. Is Aliexpress the best website for finding/buying from/communicating with suppliers?
3. What are the benefits of using Oberlo Supply?
4. Ideally, how many suppliers should I have?
- Is it best to just have 1 supplier for all my merchandise?
- I have multiple specific categories (around 4-5), can I have 1 supplier per category?
5. What are the inevitable issues that I will face from a) the whole dropshipping process, and b) new and foreign suppliers? Any suggestions to be forward-thinking and prevent (or address) these issues, when it comes up? (e.g. policies, regulations)

I have already reached out to some potential suppliers. Those that didn't reply, I feel like they will be difficult to communicate with in the future. So, I try to only pick suppliers that I can have a good communication with. BUT, I really like the merchandise of those that didn't (or haven't yet) replied.

I come from a sales background so I'm all about creating the ""funnel"". Where do you get most of your traffic from? Where are the best/easiest places to start? What kind of conversion rate would you expect from social media to website? 

Essentially I want to first start with a goal of 5000 website hits per month, from there I'm hoping to convert ~3% to sales which would translate to roughly $3000 profit/month.

So i plan to start a dropshipping business with baby clothes. 

I choose Shopify because they encourage a lot the dropshipping, they even have a complete guide on how to dropship with Aliexpress.

So im building my shop, to do thing the right way, I sent an email to Stripe that seems to be the official partner of Shopify that encourages dropshipping, to make sure they would work with my business.

After few questions about my business, they told me that my business is listed as prohibited.. they wont be able to work with me.

I understand they want to avoid scams as much as possible,
But what i find sad. Is that there is not even a trial to make sure it is a scam. They can shut my account down whenever they want anyway..

ecommerce,Where to start a marketplace website? [x-post from r/startup],"TL:DR - I want to start a open network marketplace website (like Air bnb, uber, Angie's list). I have an entrepreneurial and corporate marketing &amp; sales background but coding illiterate. Where would I start?

I have an idea that uses a similar premise to Uber or Air BNB. Users can list their good/service (my idea is niche) to an open network marketplace. Is that even what this business model is called?

I work a steady corporate job for a Fortune 500 company. I consider myself business saavy and I've started a few small-time side hustles and sold one business. I have some experience with website building platforms like Squarespace and Shopify. However, my idea would need more of a complex structure. The best I can think of is Airbnb where person A lists their space for rent, person B finds it using search criteria, and we facilitate the transaction.

My idea is scalable where I could start on a local geography and scale. Where would I begin? Must I outsource dedicated coders? If so how/where? What is the best way to estimate costs?

Also I may complicate things by having person A post free, person B a fee/subscription to use. Instead of charge by transaction.

We are not a middleman, I know this is probably cliche, but you will be buying direct from the manufacturer with us. We provide fast shipping around the world. Let me know what else you would like to know.

----------- edited on 8/05/2017 -----------

Recently I've been getting these questions so I thought I would insert them into the body of this post for others who might have the same questions:

&gt; Do you have higher quality photos without watermarks?

* Absolutely! In the Drop Shippers membership dashboard, find the Reseller section. In this section click the pictures. There will be higher resolution pictures without watermarks in that section.

&gt; Where is the link to sign up for a dropship account?

* On the website there is a link to register for a normal membership account. Click that link and complete the form.
Confirm your email address.
Contact my colleagues over at customer service and ask them to upgrade your normal account to a dropship membership account. Don't worry it's free.

The drop shipping account will allow you incentives, some of which include circumvention protection. We know allot of buyers might try to circumvent our drop shippers after their first purchase.

For instance, let's say a customer buys from you on your drop shipping website. Later on that customer reverse traces our company and starts ordering directly from us. I'm sure this happens to allot of drop shippers. That's sad, because allot of revenue is lost this way. Well, not here. Our system is set up to still pay you out if your customers comes to us after initially buying with you. Thus, that customer is always your customer. That’s the way it should be right!

Currently, you'll receive 40% of what the customer spends on our website. That's right, you'll still get paid and that commission is 40%. Therefore, while you are in your membership dashboard, I highly suggest that you click the ""Social Money"" Area. Get your social money code and link that in all your videos on youtube, vimeo, twitter, facebook, etc.

The ""Social Money"" link records your earnings. If the customer spends $350.00 on their order, your ""Social Money"" Commission will be $140.00. You'll see this amount in your ""Social Money"" portion of the dashboard. This is real money and will be paid out to you in cash or on your next order. Whichever comes first.

Other incentives include discount shipping, free shipping, percentage discounts, review rewards (currently 20% discount off your next order), and so on. The list goes on, contact customer service for more specifics after your account is approved.


----------- edited on 8/04/2017 -----------

* Drop Shipper(s): when you decide to open up an account, ensure that you contact customer service and ask them to up grade your account. It's free. Have questions, let me know. I'm here.

* Distributors or Retailers: Don't want to drop ship? Not a problem. Our product lines can produce 500 to 500K pieces of what you need - ON DEMAND. We can help you stock your warehouse with inventory, today. Contact me for questions or support.

I was waiting to hear back from the mods, but thus far I haven’t heard anything. Without further ado, I’ll just place the link here for all to see and visit.

Our website isn’t the best and if you experience some issues, due let me know and I’ll report them to the IT department. They normally remedy known issues quickly.

After you visit the website, let me know if there is anything that will fit your niche. We are always coming out with some interesting items, so if you don’t see something that you can make a niche out of or add to your existing niche, let me know what I can help you with other than what we showcase.

The prices on our website are wholesale prices. When you create a free membership account, you’ll have access to the quantity prices.

You can shop with a membership account or you can shop without one, it is your choice. There are coupons listed on our front page. You can use those coupons with your purchase at any time.

There are various incentives that come with a membership account. As mentioned above you can combine your membership account with the discount coupons listed on our website.

With a membership account, you can leave feedback and receive 20% off your next order.

We always provide incentives. Here are some examples:

When you hit a certain amount of cash sales in a calendar year, you open up more incentives.

* $250 – receive free shipping on your next order

* $500 – select a free product of your choice

* $750 – percentage discount (added to your account)

* $1000 - access to what I like to call the Gold list (Distributor Pricing)

As you can see, your membership account can be customized so that we can best take care of your immediate and direct needs. No two accounts will ever be the same. Let us know your requirements and we’ll help you set up your account for drop shipping savings.

Also with a membership account, make sure you take advantage of social money.

If you have any questions please feel welcome to let me know them. Should you decide to sign up, let me know or talk directly with Cassandra Spencer. Tell her I sent you and she’ll take care of you as well.

We find it more efficient as you all know to communicate with our web form. If you chat with Cassandra, use our web form. Cassandra or any of my colleagues will be eager to assist you.

ecommerce,Ecommerce recommendation,"Hello all,

I'm trying to help my cousin choose a good ecommerce platform for his business. He is providing winemaking supplies and kits, and would like a catalog style where he could input the items and then the customer can browse and buy directly, without him needing to speak with them directly to complete the sale. 

What would be some good suggestions for ecommerce options? I've looked at the included options that Wix, GoDaddy, and Wordpress include, but I'm not sure those will work they way he wants.

I am using a translator to switch my site to Spanish when ever i get a Spanish speaking customer but my question is how will my Search option understand? If i go to Amazon even though its in English and I search for a product in Spanish say Vestido (dress) all the dresses populate. Is that because the People have Uploaded the Product with both Dress and Vestido as a tag or is the search engine automatically recognizing the language and pulling every other product by language.

ecommerce,[Mod Post] Rule updates and a friendly reminder,"Hello, /r/ecommerce, PandaProphetess and Co. here. We've got some rule updates and a friendly reminder for you. The sidebar has been updated to reflect these changes. If you feel more clarification is needed for these rules (or any rules we have in place) please let us know in the comments.

Rule 3 revision:

Original: When reviewing a site for a user, please be civil and constructive.

Now: Be polite to each other. When reviewing a site for a user, please be civil and constructive. Do not attack, harass, or stalk other users. **Violation of this rule will result in an immediate ban.**

Why? We recently had a user in our subreddit who followed another user around multiple subs, trolled through that user’s history, and harassed them. While the harasser’s reasoning was “just” from the outside looking in, **this type of behavior is against Reddit’s site rules.** It should go without saying that we will **not** tolerate harassment of any form in /r/ecommerce. If you see this type of behavior, please report it immediately.

**New rule:** Absolutely no posts will be allowed in which you are trying to sell your existing ecommerce store (rule 5).

Rule 5: **No selling of stores** r/ecommerce is not the place to sell your existing ecommerce store. Under no circumstance do we allow users to post their stores for sale here. Those types of posts are best directed to r/entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, or offsite. Users who violate this rule will be banned, due to the risk of fraud and dishonesty it causes.

Why? We feel the risk of fraud is too great to allow users to sell their stores on our platform. We do not condone transactions like this in our subreddit. Further, this subreddit was designed for the free exchange of information, not as a place to make a quick buck off your existing store.

---

**Friendly Reminder**

Be excellent to each other, always. If you see negative, hateful, or harmful comments/posts, **report them.** Your mod team is, unfortunately, only human, and we can't watch every single post. We need your help to keep that garbage out of our sub.

dropship,Kill my store,"According to my Facebook pixel I have gotten 160 visits, 18 add to carts and 0 sales. Although I have a feeling that it's been more like 5-7 unique add to carts. The pixel confuses me a bit. 

My store is 1 1/2 week old.

My facebook ads direct people to offers such as this one: 

https://galaxynorth.com/collections/dogs-animals/products/loving-chihuahua-necklace

It's a general store right now because I'm testing different products/niches. 
Maybe that's the reason why I haven't gotten sales yet - that people don't feel directly spoken too? They might come into my store and think, ""Let me check if Amazon also has it.""

I just dropped the shipping for free items from $10.75 to $7.49, which might help.

woocommerce,"Square payment plugin ""Error: Square was unable to complete the transaction. Please try again later or use another means of payment.""","Okay, I've already sent a support ticket to WooCommerce about this but since they outsource their support to a third-party contractor in another country who is demanding that I give them administrator access to my website to fix it before anything else, (really?) I am looking elsewhere for help. 

I've googled the heck out of this problem and it seems very common, but there is no solutions online. The default response from any official source is ""Please send us a ticket in private."" and I wish they would post how to fix this publicly. 

Anyway... here goes.
I am using a ""pay invoice"" process, and customers are to pay the invoice listed in their ""My Account"" page. On the payment page, (which is the ""order-pay"" endpoint) it lists an overview of the order/invoice and the square payment fields...this is not a normal ""cart-&gt;checkout"" flow. 

When trying to pay, the error message appears: ""Error: Square was unable to complete the transaction. Please try again later or use another means of payment."" -

Online searches indicate lots of others having this exact issue and  that the Square plugin is looking for field information that is not being provided during checkout. Either a ""card_nonce"" or email address. I don't know what ""card_nonce"" is but I believe it is the latter, despite there being an email address associated with the order, it seems that it is not being processed during the transaction. There are a fair number of complaints about this problem but I cannot find a solution. 

A common idea in troubleshooting this problem is that whatever theme I am using (Brigsby Premium, btw) is using a custom page for the ""order-pay"" endpoint and does not include the email address field. As far as I can tell this is not the case for my site. 

The problem is that I am not sure how to go about adding a WooCommerce field into this template by myself without instruction.

Anyone got any ideas?

ecommerce,Creating an online shop for an existing local business,"Hi guys, I'm new to this subreddit :)

So, I recently started working at a local auto parts shop. This has been struggling for the last months, maybe years, to keep up with the competitors. I believe a great reason is because we have no online shop.

So, I'd like to try setting up one. I would like to create something as simple as possible (for starters anyway), like, somewhere where we can input some of the articles we have for sale, and people could order, choose to pay to a paypal account, throught bank transfer, or on collection. Then, for keeping things simple, we should recieve an email in the store's address with the order.

I've looked at stuff like Shopify and WooCommerce, but I'm not sure if this is the way to go. I'm also willing to learn web design etc on my own, as I plan to use it further down the road.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks in advance.
