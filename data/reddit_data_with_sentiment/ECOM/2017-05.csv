ecommerce,"I want to find out the exactly bestselling models - not the niche, category, brand etc","Hi everyone!

On internet I could find many resources of how to find bestselling products but most of them talk about a niche, category or brands. I already have my niche and suppliers and I would like to know how to use websites or tools to find what exactly products are the best seller.

For example: Oakley sunglasses. I know they have very good sellers and some dont sell at all. The collection Holbrook is very famous. The black model with red lens is very popular. The white one with green lens has no sales at all. What I usually do is to check the models with more reviews on Amazon or number of sales on Ebay. It's ok but I'm wondering if I could have more resources to get better information. 

Anyone could help me to improve my research?

ecommerce,Trying to get into Drop Shipping,"Hi everyone. I've been lurking for a while and noticed this is a great community.
I am looking to start an E-Commerce site using the Drop Shipping business model. I am a Front End Developer that's looking to generate some extra revenue on the side.
Here's the thing. I'm not looking to make a tons of cash with this project. I am just trying to turn a profit. Seriously I would be happy making anywhere between $200-$500 a month. More than happy really lol. I've read tons of guides, and have a good grasp on the business model and the ppc scene. I have a few niche ideas however I am still weary and need some advice.
Given the low overhead since I am a web designer myself, how likely is it that I'll make any sort of money? I guess I am just looking for votes of confidence or some stories of success. I am not trying to earn a salary like income or anything, just profit at all. Is this likely???

I just created a mastermind group (currently has a few members) with the aim of it to provide support, accountability, and value to a small group of members, along with the hopes of nurturing strong lasting friendships that go beyond business.

I'm a senior in college who is graduating in one week. I have enough runway for three months of grinding, and I'll stop at nothing to make sure I'm earning enough by the end of summer from my newly established eCommerce business (currently in its infancy stage) so that I can tell corporate America to f@&amp;$ off.

-weekly conference call 
-daily slack interaction 
-holding each other accountable

woocommerce,"I spent the last 3 month developing an app to ship your WooCommerce Orders directly from your iPhone &amp; iPad. What do you think, guys?","Howdy Mates!

**TLTR;**

Yeah, I spent the last 3 month developing an app which helps you guys to ship your incoming WooCommerce orders straight from your iPhone using the built-in barcode scanner. It's kind of a side-project, but as the demand is kinda huge, I decided to release it to the public as the official WooCommerce iPhone App lacks those fundamentals, unfortunately. You will find [some screenshots here](https://picklist.pro)

**Why?**

Basically I figured out that there is just no real-life order handling tool for WooCommerce. There are some solutions out there like ""PickingPal"" or ""Print Invoices &amp; Packing Lists"" but if you start using them and hand them over to your staff, you will feel the pain ;-)


**What? **

If you look at the big players and the masters of order handling like Amazon, you will recognize that their success in business is all over automation - mostly due to intelligent order handling tools on mobile devices...

That's why I started PickList for WooCommerce, which gives you the ability to pick and ship your incoming orders from your iPhone etc. (actually an iPod touch for $180 is sufficient). It provides you guys with some clever order handling principles, which you would learn within the first year of your ""Logistics Management"" studies xD

**How?**

You just hand over the device with the PickList app to your ""warehouse"" workers and they will see all the open orders ready to be fulfilled. 

After they taped on an order, PickList will present them with a pick list including the item's image, name, variation attributes and last but not least the SKU. They just scan the item's barcode or confirm the right pick manually (if your items don't have barcodes...). Once all items from on order are picked, the order is automatically marked as ""completed"" and your customer gets notified about that his / her order is on the way. Easy, huh?

**Installation?**

No fancy or complicated ""warehouse management system"" just the most powerful order picking essentials packed into an app for WooCommerce. Installation takes like 1 Minute, but see for yourself [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYT1BmriRuU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYT1BmriRuU) (sorry for the German accent, at least we can call it ""Made in Germany"" xD).

Tell me what you think guys,
Daniel

Men's and Women's site: shoptigertree.com
Kids site: Cubshrub.com

For POS reasons we had to open new accounts which sort of nixed the old way of doing things so we built out a new site for the kids store. 
There are a few things I know aren't working like the banner on the kids site is just temporary and not super engaging, we're still working on getting descriptions back on everything as we lost a bunch of data in the switchover, same on the men's and women's store now with the copy.  The copy stuff I will have sorted within a couple of weeks and I am working on now. Beyond that I sort of feel stuck and would love some advice.
I feel like we have great products, as evidenced by our sales in store. I think our flat lay photography is up to standards and our editorial/model shots are great.  We do maybe 4-5 sales a day online which I think is probably alright for not doing any marketing at all but I feel like our websites should be challenging our physical locations at this point and they just sort of limp along and are maybe 5% of our overall sales. 
I am willing to put a lot of time into this but overtime I sit down to work I feel a mixture of overwhelmed and aimless. I always struggle to put money into marketing because the sites never really ""feel done"" to me.  I will say I did some retargeting last year with pretty good results and got good data on when my tipping point based on my traffic was for the ROI starting to go down the other side of the bell.
I would love any advice on the sites themselves and changes you think should be made and where my time would be better spent.

As the title explains, I have a customer who input the wrong shipping address on an order. She screwed up the house number and actually put a house number that is non existent (so the package did not end up at a neighbor) 
She actually did this for two orders. One item ended up making it's way to her. The other was marked as returning to sender, but never got returned. 
She now wants me to send a replacement for free, saying she paid for this item but never received it. In my mind, I fulfilled the order and due to her mistake, it's her loss. 
If it were another customer, I'm inclined to be courteous and fill the order, but this one has not been the nicest.

woocommerce,Purchase Orders?,"Hi everyone!

I need a solution for purchase orders.  I know that WC provides a premium (paid) plugin for purchase orders, and I was just about to purchase it, but decided to come here first and see if there were any other solutions, as well as see if I could gain any insight about how the WooCommerce Purchase Order Gateway plugin works.

I'll be the first to admit that my knowledge of purchase orders in general is VERY limited; I've never worked with them personally.  What I'm told is that we would need: 1) a way for the customer to turn their cart items into either an invoice or a quote, which they could download/print as a PDF, and then the customer's company uses that document to create a purchase order.  Then, 2) the customer would submit the purchase order to us whenever their company completed it, and as soon as our company manually approves the purchase order, then 3) WooCommerce would go ahead and release their purchases to them (because the purchase order is a promise for payment and in this case, the promise for payment is from a government entity so it's ""guaranteed"").

So, first off, do you guys know of a plugin for WooCommerce that would facilitate this process, or at least parts of it?  I can't find ANY except for the one I mentioned.

Secondly, if the WooCommerce Purchase Order Gateway plugin is the only option, that's fine, but has anyone here worked with it before?  Can anyone tell me which parts of the above process I described, that it handles?

ecommerce,A little disappointed with the new Amazon Merch shirt quality. Bella+Canvas vs. American Apparell,"So I'm assuming we have some Amazon Merch sellers in here, maybe some of you guys even have your own Shopify stores and use Amazon Merch as your dropshipper. As most of you probably know American Apparel is no longer in business and that is who used to provide Amazon Merch's premium quality shirts.

They switched to Bella+Canvas. I was really optimistic about the change as I had seen many designers and Youtubers and screenprinters raving about the Bella+Canvas 3001 model shirts. 

I'm not sure if that's what Amazon is using or not but either way, I'm somewhat disapointed in the quality of the shirts. Don't get me wrong, its nothing like a hanes shirt and it's not like those crappy teespring shirts, but it's also not as good as the old American Apparel IMHO.

The shirt seems to be about half as thick as American Apparel. The tag also feels much cheaper more like a mattress tag where as the American Apparel shirts had a really soft tag. I can also see through the Bella+Canvas shirts where as I couldn't see through the American Apparel shirts.

It's not as if Amazon was being cheap, American Apparel obviously isn't even an option but a little disapointed in shirt quality.

I've spent the last decade running my own executive search business which has been great but in the last 6 months or so as the economy slows I've been doing more and more resumes and cvs. This is kind of an accidental business but I'm running with it as I'm making money and getting great feedback and it just keeps growing.

My question is about courses however, I've seen some demand to create an online course for people on resume and cv writing, LinkedIn profile writing, cover letters etc. Basically the whole gamut of the job hunting process.

Now I've trained people in multiple industries in person but I have literally zero idea about doing it online.

Anyone run online training? Pitfalls? Advise? Etc. Any info would be appreciated.

I'm thinking about launching an e-commerce website in a very small niche : Time Capsule. 
I would like to make this accessible by anyone not only schools or companies. This is what I have so far :

Products : Dropship from aliexpress at first time. Move on to stock in the future. 
Not only sell time capsule but also a whole package with ervy tools needed to bury it. 

Website : Blog with article bi-weekly about some famous time capsule or some advice

Ads : no idea yet. 

Clients : mostly young adults with children. Most of the clients are buying one time and that's it. So I have to really impress during the sale and the experience in the website.

About a year ago I offered free theming help for stores on here and basically everybody I have dealt with thought that changing around their theme will finally bring them sales which obviously never worked. Most of the stores I have helped out are either closed or still have no sales and I feel there is a problem to address here.


As the title suggest I am looking for a few people who are having trouble getting sales with their store to test a future product of mine. The whole thing is basically in it's infancy and I want to make sure that people actually get something out of it before releasing it to the world. It's free for all testers obviously and you might learn something as a side effect! 

I am looking for around 10 people and it would be amazing If I could find them right here! Even better if you have tried some of the original Shopify guides and videos with limited success.

woocommerce,Shipping Options,"Hey Team,  

I've got an issue at work that is apparently my job to fix that you guys might be able to help with.

Im from New Zealand and we ship stuff all over the country. We use postcode shipping at a rate of $15 for the south island and $10 for most of the north island. 

My issue is that when customers decide to buy some big items. Not necessarily lots of items, but a few big items, we still only charge them $15 and it costs us about $30-50 for south island shipping. 

Im looking for something where i can keep postcode shipping for our site and then add on extra shipping on certain products

For example:

A customer buys a t-shirt and also a hockey gear bag

They get charged $15 for the t-shirt but because they have the gear bag, they get the oversized item charge which adds an additional $15 onto the order so their total shipping is $30

Any ideas? We already have hundreds of products on our site so i dont want to go through and add a shipping class to each existing product.

ecommerce,Importing goods to USA from Russia,"I'll be importing some canned food from Russia (basically a box of random Russian food items). Long story short, was going to order a pallet of them but this route proved to be very difficult and extremely complicated, especially communicating with Russian couriers so im going to import them one by one in their own parcels.

Ill be importing a small batch of 12 separate packages at first to test the waters. They're valued at $8 USD each and weigh about 2kg and cost ~$15 each to ship.

They'll be sending by Russian Post. I believe Russian Post switches to USPS once in USA, but I cant confirm this. USPS states they have ""No brokerage fees"" and I read the De Minimis Value is $800 so I wont be charged any sort of duty or tax since its below this threshold. 

This is also a food-item bundle so this is FDA territory.

Questions:

1) Will be be safe from tax / duty / tariffs since the packages are below $800?

2) Will I need to get involved with the FDA since this is a foodstuff?

3) Any other concerns you see reading my post? If these packages arrive without hassle, I'd like to do the same and import 100 more, do you think this would complicate issues?

dropship,Dropship Band Merch,"I was looking at adding some band t-shirts to my dropshipping site.  I've found a ton on aliexpress I want to use. I'm wondering to what extent I should worry about copyright.

I feel there are a few routes:

1.) Just do it and nothing will happen
2.) Do it and get a cease-and-desist from certain bands
3.) Do it and maybe face more legal action

Another point: It looks like for some bands that if the shirt is in the $5-$7 range it's an actual shirt that would be sold in stores whereas shirts in the $12-$14 range are (possibly) printed to order. My assumption is that the prior situation might have some deal with the label.

I know people shy away from selling name brand articles because of the likelihood of it being fake, but what about this situation? The bands are doing the same thing (i.e. getting a supplier to make shirts for $5 to markup to $20 at shows).

One last point (not sure if people would know this): How does a site like hottopic.com do it? I doubt they have a 'deal' with every single band whose shirts they sell, and if you're going to say they have a deal with the record label, there are always shirts they have from random old-school punk bands where I doubt they made deals with each (or maybe they did.. I don't know).

ecommerce,Starting a local clothing marketplace using Shopify or Magento?,"Hi Ecommerce!

I'm a 21 year old guy and I've been brainstorming a lot lately. I'm quite interested in starting a website/small company that allows users to register as a seller then list their own fashion pieces (clothes, accessories, shoes etc) to eventually be sold. Once sold, the seller ships/couriers said product to the buyer.

The site will ideally appeal to thrifty young people who are into a street/thrift fashion aesthetic (mid-high end). Think ASOS marketplace or grailed.com but based locally rather than internationally (for now)

The idea is that if the website gains popularity over the coming years, I will begin to charge a small commission every sale as a way to actually monetise the site. 



I have done a little bit of research into Shopify and Magento, but i'm not too sure which of the two would suit my needs in terms of creating an actual marketplace that is user driven. 

Pardon me if I sound inexperienced or ignorant about the magnitude of this project. I'm still at the drawing board and have yet to write up an actual business plan. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

woocommerce,Length + weight-based product prices,"Hi guys. I’m setting up a woocommerce website for a steel company.

They sell steel by length, but also by weight.

There are three different price categories for the lengths, as they have to cut the steel if a customer doesn’t buy a full piece. This creates labor costs, so it becomes more expensive.

For example, prices for a 4 meter long steel plate. This thing weighs 1KG for a full length:

*Price A: &lt;0.5 length: $9.90*

*Price B: &gt;0.5 length: $7.50*

*Price C: full length: $6.50 (yes, a big piece of steel is cheaper than a small piece)*


Now this is doable.



The thing is, there are also discounts if the customer buys a lot of it:

*Price D: &gt;0.5 tonne: $5.80*

*Price E: &gt;1 tonnee: $5.60*


These two weight pricing categories override the prices in lengths once they are relevant.

Very small, very old school, fake drop shadows, etc.  The photos haven't been updated since when the site first launched around 2005 or so.  There's hundreds if not a few thousand products like this. The site has about 15,000 active products at any given time.  Very few of the manufacturers supply adequate photos, so I end up photographing most of the products.

They also have very little content on the site.  No articles about their niche.  There are projects and ideas, demonstrating how to use the products, however this page is the least popular page of the main navigation categories.

My area of interest is to to go in-depth with SEO as far as creating useful content, shareable content, building backlinks, all that.  But the other side of the argument is, ""You spent all this time creating content to get people to your site, and they see poor photos of your products, they're going to be unimpressed and leave"".

So, I spend all my time taking new product photos, but fancy photos don't get anyone to the site.  Product photos aren't going to create shareable content.  I'm not taking any amazing photographs or anything, but they're better than ""decent"".

ecommerce,Need suggestions to replace my digital delivery system,"Since 2012 I've used a small PHP script called Firesage Checkout to deliver digital downloads to my customers.  It cost me $25 and used no database (dynamically-generated ""buy now"" links) integrated with PayPal so that once the $5 fee is paid the time-expiring, masked download link is displayed (and emailed) to the customer.  It has worked nearly flawlessly for me with over 1000 sales in those five years.


I've recently upgraded my site.  New domain, new responsive layout and new features.  The author of Firesage no longer supports the script and I hear that sometime this year PayPal is going to require SSL certification for ??? and the author has no intention of upgrading his old script.  Essentially, while it is still currently working, the script will be dead in the water soon.


On top of that, I would like to be able to offer a true cart for multiple purchases at once instead of the simple ""buy now"" single purchase button under each product.  I will also be selling some physical products as well, although I don't need complicated options for that... I can include shipping into the price and don't need inventory tracking.


So... I've been trying to find a replacement.  CS-Cart ($385), Squirrelcart ($169 + $45), Sunshop ($200 or $500) and X-Cart ($495) are all contenders... but none of them have me excited.  They all seem cumbersome, complicated and would require me to populate and maintain a separate database with all of my items.  They seem a little spendy, but since I've brought in $1000/year since launching the site I don't mind a small investment.


I'm hoping that someone might be able to point me in a better direction.  Here is my wishlist:

- PHP script that I can own (license) and host, if possible

- easy plug-in hooks for buttons and cart contents so I can turn my current site into the storefront

- time- and attempt-expiring, masked links to protect my self-hosted PDF files from getting stolen

- instant download link displayed AND emailed to customer

- no database (dynamically-created buttons based on unique item name)

- integration with PayPal (open to other gateways, but that seems to be easiest for all)

- reasonable cost (max $500)


Thanks guys...   I'm fairly new to Reddit and I can't get over how awesome this community can be!!

ecommerce,Brick and Mortar looking to take ecommerce from local to national need advice.,"Here goes!
I have been tasked to grow our ecommerce from local to national in a well established market. I have been reading and learning for a few months now. I would be lying if I didn't say the longer I research the more apprehensive I become.
I can't be super specific to what company I work for. The business is similar to a hardware store in the scope of customers, vendors and SKUs we have access to. The company has more than 100 vendors and 100,000+ SKUs. We do have access to third party software that provides us descriptions, specifications and photos of each SKU, which is super helpful. That is what our ecommerce solution is currently utilizing. Ideally, we would like to sell on multiple market places not just through the website itself.


The Brick and Mortar has been in business for more than 50 years and has multiple locations but they are all in the same geographical area. Our current ecommerce solution is optimized for local and has excellent SEO (locally). We come up organically on the first page for most broad searches in our industry. We also use AdWords, CPM/CPC and facebook ads but have a very modest budget for digital advertising.


I'd love to push the company to an omnichannel solution but ownership would like for the online and physical presence to remain separate. The main reasons is because the ERP is antiquated and they believed that integrating it into the ecommerce solution could become very expensive (ERP is homegrown and the language is signature basic). Perhaps there is an API that would allow for integration that I am not aware of.


There are multiple reasons I am pushing for a omnichannel approach, here are a few. I'd like to allow local online customers to have the option to pickup in store via the website. I would also like to set up login credentials that would allow customers to see their individual pricing. Like a hardware store, we have customers/contractors that would like to order their materials online and then stop by a location to pickup before they go to their jobsite. Without integrating our ERP there is no way to ensure these items would be in stock. It would also help cash flow to sell items we have in stock as opposed to drop shipping them straight from the manufacturer. Omnichannel would also allow the company to capture web users and bring them in to our physical stores. Ultimately this approach would improve our brand's image, if implemented correctly.


Looking at information provided above, for a company which has a large amount of vendors and skus, what are the positives and negatives of creating a custom site vs using an existing ecommerce platform? From what I have read most ecommerce platforms are created for small businesses that do not handle a large amount of skus. From what I have learned Mangento and BigCommerce could potentially work. There are a lot of ecommerce platforms are there any that would be a better fit?


Would you recommend the platform solution or hire someone to create a custom solution (and why)?
I have a lot more questions but will stop here for now! Thank you for any information you can provide... I'm in over my head here :)",6,7,2017-05-18,ECOM,0.02248300239443779,0.9294294118881226,0.04808758199214935

dropship,My Burning DS Questions (Oberlo),"I'm 19 years old, and I've been selling digital goods on the Chrome web store as well as selling tangible products on eBay for 7 months now. Now I'm looking to create a special DS website using Shopify and Oberlo.

My most burning questions/things I need to know still:

1. Issues with branded-products while dropshipping: I don't plan on selling any name-brand on my DS website. Nothing like Apple, Samsung, etc. obviously. But I'll still be selling Chinese brands. Do I need to worry in this case? I in fact do have a PA resale permit, so I'm hoping that helps.

2. Shipping to US and Canada: Yes, I know I should stick to ePacket. But if there's a way to get products into my customer's hands faster then I want to do that. The US and Canada are the 2 primary countries I would like to reach. However, I've noticed that there are also Aliexpress suppliers that have warehouses in the USA. This is pretty awesome for DS, because the shipping times vary from only 7-13 business days. My issue is that if I want customers in Canada to buy from me, will Shopify/Oberlo automatically be able to tell customers what items they can/can't order based on their shipping address? Because while there's free USPS shipping from these US warehouses, they do NOT ship to Canada. I'm open to using a Shopify plugin, whether paid or gratis.

3. Advertising: I work for Staples, so I get a discount on promotional things like banners, flyers, car magnets, and more. Yay or nay to car magnets advertising my site/URL? As for online marketing, I've used Project Wonderful before and think that it's a nice platform to reach niche audiences on niche websites.

4. Viewing COG at a later date: Something I've contacted Oberlo about, but they haven't gotten back to me. I've pushed a lot of products to the store so far (the store is not live, but it's nice to see how it's coming together). But now that I've pushed everything to my store, there's no way for me to view the CURRENT cost of goods (COG) for the products I pushed unless I painstakingly click every one and check the price on Aliexpress. Am I missing something here?

5. Capital: My number 1 beef with Oberlo is funding to place my orders from Aliexpress. I am 19 years old. How am I supposed to sign up for a business credit card for such a high limit? Granted, some of my current cards are over $1200, but they are store credit cards I can't use anywhere else obviously. I was thinking of using PayPal exclusively with Shopify, but then my TOTAL fees per transaction (Shopify's BS 2% for not using their gateway and PayPal) is 4.9% + $0.30. I would like to know if any of you have done this, because if I could use PayPal exclusively, I have a PayPal business debit card I could use on Aliexpress, and it would take the money I just received from buyers and put it towards their actual order. The card takes from PayPal balance first, then my bank account. What are your thoughts/opinions on this? Is nearly 5% + $0.30 too much you think for DS when I can choose my own markups?

Any guidance on these topics would be appreciated. Thank you so much!",4,4,2017-05-18,ECOM,0.033143945038318634,0.9338857531547546,0.03297032043337822

One way for ecommerce store owners to expand their reach and find new potential customers is joining an online marketplace.

Storenvy and Tictail have been around for some time, while Inktale is the new kid on the block. There are advantages and drawbacks to each of the platforms. For example, Storenvy and Tictail collect commission fees on marketplaces sales, but you can sell pretty much any kind of product there, while Inktale offers a selection of products that you can sell your designs on, but they don’t collect commission fees and they handle customer support for you.

dropship,"Finding a joined up order management system, integrated with a dropshipping solution?","So I've been in business a while now, selling furniture and homewares and I am migrating to Shopify from BigCommerce. Up until now I've been doing everything manually. This is incredibly time intensive and prone to error.

With this migration, I want to implement automation around our shipping and order management. I am specifically looking for a system that allows us to manage our orders with our dropship suppliers automatically by sending them POs, allowing communication with them via the app, and allowing invoices to be sent back by supplier (integration with Xero a huge bonus), with the critical component being to send a shipping label or 'con note' to the supplier. Why would you do that, you ask? Well, some of our suppliers offer freight for us, others don't!

ecommerce,What platform to use for 300k+ digital products (PDFs) that can be uploaded by a script?,"Not to be too vague, but I have developed a method to determine when a company has submitted filings with the government that contain mistakes. These mistakes could be very costly to a company (thousands to millions) and most companies would almost certainly want to correct the issue. 

My process would grind through government databases, find these common mistakes (usually by human error- typos, checking the wrong box, etc.) and send the company a letter by mail offering to identify the mistake for a low fee (TBD, but probably $100-$300). Clearly on the front end I would only send a few thousand letters, but if there's enough traction I could end up sending 300,000+ letters. Unfortunately, these government databases rarely, if ever, include email addresses, so I'm stuck sending letters. 

The letters would contain a code which the company could type in to an online store and then buy a 1 page report that explains the mistake made. 

The likelihood of companies buying the report is pretty low (but the math works out even for single digit percent sales), and, generally, no one unaffiliated with the company would be interested in the report. So the majority of my 'inventory' would go unsold. 

I'm looking for an ecommerce platform that allows the uploading of digital products (PDFs) via an API or some other script. My process will need to send the letter and then add the product online for the company to buy.

ecommerce,Getting shipping right,"I have a small ecommerce/manufacturing business. We make our own products, so we obviously don't drop ship. 

The biggest problem we run into, at least operations-wise, is accurately shipping exactly what the customer orders. There are two problems we face:

1. We have several very similar products, so there is a high chance of confusing two parts. For example, some parts are visually identical, but work at different voltages. Everything has a unique sku, but we need a system to guarantee the right sku is packed with the order.

2. We will often get orders for multiple pieces of the same item. Our packing slips prominently highlight the qty if it is more than one, but we still have an unreasonably high error rate on multiple part orders. 

How do other small ecommerce companies handle verifying that the shipment accurately matches exactly what was ordered? 

I'm wondering if there is an inexpensive barcode system that will let me scan each item as I pack it and check it off the list, and beep if the item is incorrect? I know there are fulfillment management solutions that do this, but I don't have a lot of budget to invest, and from what I have seen those tend to run into the big bucks. 

Or, rather than high tech, any other ideas on how to guarantee everything is right? 

One thing that won't work for us is a simple weight-based test. Many of our parts are lightweight, so the packing material will often be a larger part of the final weight than the parts, and it doesn't address the voltage differences.

ecommerce,Legality of selling brand-name items on a Shopify storefront.,"I can’t find much information online about this sort of thing so I’ll lay out the details and hopefully I can get a definitive answer from someone here who has experience with this.

Skip to the TLDR if you don’t want the long-winded backstory.

So I recently graduated college and am working for my fathers warehousing company. The company is in the process of moving to a larger location in order to accommodate their biggest client. 

Anyways, he assigned me to sell off inventory that was confiscated from an older client who couldn’t pay their bills. He said that as long as we get $20,000 for everything he will be happy because thats how much the client ended up owning him before they cut ties. 

After about a week of taking inventory I can already tell that this client abandoned A LOT more than $20,000 worth of product. My estimate puts it between $80,000 and $100,000 worth of inventory. Now I know I won’t be getting nearly that much after fees and everything but I digress.

Currently I have been selling these products on our Amazon storefront which already has a good history from when I did something similar a few years ago. All of these items are very expensive brand name items. Calvin Klein, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Swarovski, Swatch, Furla, etc.

Amazon is annoying because they require brand approval in order to sell most of these brands. I have been able to list the Swarovski and Furla items plus some sunglasses but the 700 or so Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger handbags require special approval. 

I have been trying to contact both of these brands via email but none have gotten back, so I mailed a letter to PVH, their parent company, yesterday.

All of this makes me want to abandon Amazon as a marketplace and set up a Shopify store, which I already have experience with, and sell these brand name items on there.

TLDR: I had a few questions about the legality of selling brand name items on a Shopify store.

1.) Is it even legal to sell brand name items without the brands permission? I have documentation showing that these items are genuine and documentation showing that we do in fact own these items.

2.) If I do get a Shopify storefront going, is it legal to advertise specific products on Facebook and have them link to our store? Or would these brands come after me for that?

3.) If it is legal to sell the items, but not legal to advertise specific products, would it be okay to just advertise our stores home-page and have customers find the products on their own?

An answer to any of these questions would be a big help for me in finding out where I should go next.",3,2,2017-05-23,ECOM,0.05001000314950943,0.9220489859580994,0.027940988540649414

ecommerce,Anyone customized their eCommerce site based on location of user? What's your opinion on this?,"I was reading a post (link in the comment below for those interested) about customizing your eCommerce site based on the location of each user. 

The reason for doing this is that by offering personalized content you have a higher chance of turning a visitor into a customer. I thought this would be really hard to do, but after reading this article, it looks like it's actually not that hard at all! 

I was interested to know if anyone has used this method? What do you think of it? Have you seen results? (And what sort of results?)
If you haven't used it yet, do you think it's worth trying? Would you consider it for your eShop?

The main 3 arguments of why one should do it in the article are: 
Culture -- You can customize the products customers around the world see based on their weather (this West Coast vs. East Coast in winter), local holidays, and other events.
Currency -- Shoppers can see items in their own currency which they understand better and is much more familiar. 
Commute -- you can create maps with your physical locations based on proximity the proximity of each user.

Are there other examples in the e-commerce world where multiple users perform activities for a singular purpose? Or an e-commerce platform which promotes group behavior?

I know that Amazon offers his fulfillment option which is, if I understood well, where you can send them your inventory, and they're shipping it for you. For this, you need to sell on their website.

My question is, what if I want to sell on my website too, and use their fulfillment option?

1- Sell on my website
2- Go on Amazon, order my product from them to my customer.
3- Customer received its order from Amazon.

ecommerce,Website review,"Hey fellow Redditers,

**A joke to make this worth it**: What's the difference between a dirty bus stop and a lobster with breast implants? One's a crusty bus station and the other's a busty crustacean.


**Onto the meat**: 3 years ago: I started printing my photos on wood and people bought them up. I made about $10k over the course of 2 years, but $ per hour it wasn't worth it (lots of long nights).


**1 year ago**: I figured out how to scale this without building everything myself. I have a vendor that creates the physical prints and I'm partnering with photographers to provide the content. Started creating and tweaking.


**4 months ago**: I quit my corporate job to pursue this full-time and follow my gf while she travel nurses.


**Now**: have the draft site more or less up and running and looking for feedback.


**The concept** is we handpick talented photographers and curate their photos. Then, we use a top-rated vendor (US) to produce and dropship high-quality prints (i.e. museum quality). So... you're not sifting through 1000's of sub-par photographs, getting cheap sh*t or paying 4-figures for good, authentic art. If galleries are Bugatti and Art of America is Kia, we're aiming to be the Grand Cherokee/4Runner of the art world.


I'm still recruiting photographers, so what you see on there is just a start to make the gallery look legitimate. I'm hoping to have 20-30 good photographers on board before making a marketing splash.


**My two main questions**: 
1. The concept - would you buy? If not, why? 
2. The site - I know it's not perfect, but where have I already gotten off track?


Rip 'er apart... I'm in a place where I can make changes without much sacrifice.

Thank you infinitely. For those with sites... you know how valuable this is. I'm eternally grateful (even for the not-so-nice comments).

You all have probably heard about hand spinners by now. Love them or hate them, we are selling tons of them in our physical stores. I'm not going to disclose how much in a public forum, but we are sitting on a LOT of merchandise and I want to move it.

We have already built the site and it has been live for about three weeks. On its best days, the site converts at 3% but this past week has only been 1.3%. I believe with some tweaks, we can get it consistently to 3%. In order to be profitable, I need a cost per conversion of $3.

I hired a professional marketing company to help and told them my $3 target and they claimed they could do it. With a 3% conversion rate, that pencils out to roughly $0.09 per click. They assured me this was possible and after two weeks running with it, their CPC was between $.50 and $1.20. Not sustainable.

So, I am looking for an experienced marketer that can take an existing site with existing inventory and fulfillment infrastructure and get us the traffic and conversions we need. I am flexible on how the deal is structured. If you don't have experience in this, I don't want to be a guinea pig.

ecommerce,How necessary are business formalities when testing products?,"Hi all,

I have an idea for a niche that I'd like to test but am curious how much of the business 'formalities' must be met in order to do so.

Quick history, I opened a Shopify store about a year or so ago however ended up closing it soon after as a result of the niche not being very viable, as well as getting involved with another initiative. Before opening this store I started an LLC, opened a business checking account, rented out a UPS Store box and a number of other business formalities, many of which, in retrospect, were probably unnecessary.

This time around I just want to test a few products without getting carried away with all of the above. However, would like to appear at least somewhat legitimate to potential buyers.

Questions for testing products:
1) What should I use for an address? I feel like using my home address would look a bit amateur. Do I even need to designate one?
2) What about a phone number..?
3) Can I have purchases going into my personal checking account? What might be the best way to go about this? (Stripe, Shopify Payments, etc)
4) At what point is it really necessary to establish a formal business structure? Can I just stay a sole proprietor for awhile?

dropship,Is this a good drop shipping niche?,"I found what seems to me like a great drop shipping niche.

I've never actually ran a drop shipping site though so I am hoping to get an experts opinion.

Traffic

Traffic seems great for the niche, huge market/search volume. I only plan on using bing ads for traffic. Keywords such as ""Buy my product"" and ""specific product name"" are between 0.17-0.30 per click.

Profit margins

The average profit margin seems between $300-$500 per product however I don't have a wholesaler (just looked on alibaba)

Competitors

There for sure is a good amount of other companies selling these products however with the cost per click so low I can't see that being a problem.

Is it just me or does that sound like a good niche?

dropship,Advice on getting started,"Hi all first time posting. I've been considering drop shipping for years, and with the availability of apps like Oberlo and Shopified it seems more appealing than ever.

My question(s), besides any general advice you can offer to a newbie, are: 

Are these apps as good as they look?

I've looked around online and haven't found much in the way of authoritative or reliable quantitative reviews (Oberlo is on trust pilot but for the vast majority of reviewers Oberlo is their only review). That said Oberlo does seem tone slightly better here as it was featured in Forbes

Which is the better of the two currently? (the couple of resources I found on this were dated)

Are there better alternatives or any pitfalls I should be aware for?

Thanks in advance for any insight and advice you can offer!

It's a women's clothes store I setup for my wife so she can have some extra income.

I was getting more traffic from Facebook Ads and I was about to stop the Instagram ones when I received the order notification.

My setup is a basic Shopify store with the Minimal theme. My vendor is located in the US so my delivery time is 3-5 days. My margin is around 40%-ish. Well in this sale the shipping rate ate my margin because I forgot to setup the shipping rates on the Shopify store! :(, but still got a margin of 12%, including Shopify fee.

This is my first store, and it took me two days to put everything together. I'm very excited!

So I was thinking I'd get something along the lines of Wix, where I can have an attractive landing page, portfolio on one page, request form on another page, then a link over to my Etsy store (which I'd like to keep, at least for now, as I get pretty good traffic through there).

Marketing would be the most important part of my product in my opinion. Any good strategy or advise to start making my first sale is appreciated, any thoughts?
