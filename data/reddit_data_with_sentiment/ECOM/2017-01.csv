ecommerce,Best way to Sell Underwear?(X-Post),"Hi everybody, hopefully you're all having a nice day.

I'm looking to create custom underwear, but the problem is that all the companies I see supplying these don't offer bulk deals.

My questions: 1.Do you know of a company that will print pictures on underwear for bulk?

 2. If this isn't the case, would I be able to buy bulk underwear from one source, then send it to another to have them print something on it? Also, how accurate would these be in terms of location of the image? If you know of any companies, I'd love to know.

3. Does Amazon offer Print On Demand for underwear? I can't seem to find anything on it.

Thank you SO MUCH.",5,4,2017-01-01,ECOM,0.025458358228206635,0.9277886748313904,0.0467529334127903

ecommerce,Tips and feedback for my website,"Hey guys, I opened the doors to my online baby boutique two weeks ago and I'm having trouble getting visitors. I spent countless hours designing my website for the best user experience and finding the highest quality baby toys and apparel. I had a rather succesful opening day but traffic has since dropped off. I invested in Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and reddit ads with little to no return and I'm regularly posting on all 3 channels. I am also working on increasing my instagram followers count. I am currently rewriting all my product descriptions so they are original and more seo friendly. Should I be doing anything differently to make sure my products are being viewed by potential buyers? I have yet to make a sale and am getting nervous that I could be doing more to improve my chances of success. If you could look at my website and let me know if there's anything I could change or if you have any tips on how to get more traffic that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)

shopify,New to Shopify Theme Development,"Hi there. I am a professional web developer and I am trying to help a friend start a shopify store. I found a few starter themes (timber, slate, etc.) to begin development on and Theme Kit. I just have a few questions regarding theme development.

1. What is going on with slate? I like the directory structure, but all the links on NPM to the github repo return 404's. Is it not open source anymore, or have they abandoned it?

2. How can I setup the config.yml file to hit my API key? From what I can tell, the slate generated config file doesn't show an example for the key, just the password, theme id, store, and ignored files.

3. Once I get this working should I add node_modules to the ignored files so that is prevented in being uploaded to the shopify site?

ecommerce,Facebook marketing: DIY or Expert provider?,"As most entrepreneurs, I fancy myself as a learner and DIY guy.  Part of me thinks FB marketing should be easy, I can learn it myself, and that many social marketers are snake oil salesmen.  The other part thinks I will be money ahead by paying for the service, not wasting money on failed efforts, generating more sales and ROI quicker. I suppose there is a middle ground where I pay a person, then learn from them and ultimately take over the marketing. 

I am curious what your experiences have been with Facebook marketing (google adwords too if applicable).  Did you have success using an expert?  Did you try an expert only to find they recreate what you would have done on your own?

woocommerce,"Come join the Rocket Squirrels, a team of webdevs on Slack","Hey everyone,

Nearly 2 years ago I posted on here that I wanted to gather a small team of web designers, coders, and webdevs, to create a Slack team. The purpose behind the group is to create a team which can help each other with troubleshooting, share industry news and best practices, as well as keep each other sane during those long projects.

I'm really happy to say that over the past 2 years, 16 people have joined the team, and now we're looking for the next group of skilled webdevs to join us!

We are looking for people who are moderately experienced in either web design, programming / coding, graphic design, digital marketing (doesn't matter which field you prefer), WordPress, sysadmins, hosting, devops, or any field related to the ones above.

Most of our members are self-employed, freelance, or employed, with varying skillsets and experience. There's no commitment, chat when you're free. We chat almost every day, though it's always second to work commitments.

If you're interested, you can enter your details [on our signup page](https://rocketsquirrel.signup.team/) and we'll approve your application, then you'll be able to join the Slack team. Alternatively if you'd like more information, please send me a direct message.

shopify,Help/advice on creating an online Sneaker/Streetwear Store on Shopify/Big Cartel,"Hi everyone,

From Canada, and thinking of creating an online exclusive sneaker/streetwear store (with resell prices to reflect the resell market aswell as discounted items). There are currently a few sites on Shopify/Big Cartel that sell sneakers (Nike,Jordan,Adidas) at a resell price (higher than retail), so I am assuming it is OK legally?(without an account or affliation with said companies). The Purpose of this site, would essentially be to get rid of shoes in my collection I don't want anymore, or to sell a few big ticket items I have. I have heard many good things about Shopify and just wanted to ask some questions to experienced individuals.

1) Do I need a registered Ontario (Canada) Business License in order to register/create/run an ecommerce store on Shopify?

2) Are there any legal barriers to selling (Nike,Adidas,Jordan) products on my site without an affiliation with them? I don't want a nasty email from said companies. I am just looking to sell what I don't want in my collection essentially (no full size runs), and will not be constantly adding new stock every day/week. 

3) Do I need a company PayPal account to link to my store for payments? If so, do I need a registered Ontario (Canada) Business License in order to create a Company PayPal account?

Any advice/comments would be greatly appreciated!

ecommerce,What to do when expectations surpass what is realistically possible?,"I started working for a B2B wholesale bussiness a couple months ago. They had the idea to start selling their products online (B2C). They sell a ton of different product types ranging from electronics to textile, suitcases and many more. 

The website has been running for over 1.5 years with little to no succes. They hired me to change that. When I first started they had no meta-descriptions/titles and they had a very broad Adword campaign running. Aside from the products there is 0 content on the website.

I managed to double the CTR and (more than) half our CPC on Adwords. The bounce rate has come down from 90% to around 60%. All product pages (over a 1000 products and increasing) now have meta-titles and descriptions. There is (obviously) next to no organic trafic. The (paid) trafic has gone up and the sales have followed. Yet my bosses expect more.

I'm stuck now. I can recommend boosting the Adwords budget but it's already costing more than the revenue the website is making. I can recommend to start writing content but our website has so many different products and types of products I don't know where to start. It is hard to find a USP because we have no niche and there are more established websites selling the same products. Backlinks are hard to come by because we only sell stuff others are selling too. The only thing we got going for us, is that the online market in our country isn't saturated yet.

I feel like they should abandon the whole 'lets start a website with 1k+ products' idea and should start focusing on a single product group. Adding more types of products as time goes by. But they are invested, they bought a very expensive website and are determined to become the Amazon of our country (and beyond).

So, what should I do?",2,4,2017-01-05,ECOM,0.026672102510929108,0.9311521053314209,0.04217580705881119

ecommerce,Question about selling eCommerce Store and valuation.,"So, I began a Shopify store last fall and managed to generate $47k in revenue since then. My product is very gift oriented, so sales just completely blew up during the holiday. I stopped marketing to focus on a major life event, so sales have stopped. I have virtually zero organic traffic, 95% of my sales are generated by search, the rest by some social retargeting. Profit margin is in the 15% - 20% range, and it could be much higher with more efficient sales channels.

I'm thinking of selling the website to move on to new things, as this was a fun experiment, but I don't have the energy to keep it up right now. **Would a site like Flippa be the right place for this? Are there other marketplaces? How do I valuate the site to ensure I'm getting the right return?** 

Next year, with the kind of experience I developed, I think this site could do double that revenue target, so I think that could be a huge selling point for a potential buyer (or I could just sit on the site till the holidays while I try other things).",5,3,2017-01-05,ECOM,0.01956336386501789,0.9004214406013489,0.0800151526927948

woocommerce,Include User's Role Type in Order Details,"Hello,

We currently sell products at two main price levels, retail pricing and discounted dealer pricing for customers that meet certain criteria.

I was able to find a plugin that allows me to create custom Wordpress User Roles, and a second plugin that allows me to set separate pricing on items based on user role - When used together, results are just as expected. (Specific Plugin names/authors available upon request)

I've been hitting a wall trying to accomplish one last bit pertaining to this area of our store, and that is the following:

I want to write a bit of code that determines the role of the user that placed an order, and from there passes the information to the Admin order details area as well as the Admin new-order E-Mails.

I've taken a look at the wordpress E-Mail Templates, Order screen templates (none of which seem relevant to admin-specific order reviewal), as well as written several basic functions, and I'm either get PHP errors upon placing an order/resending order E-Mail or with my last approach I would simply get my current (Administrator) role echo'd.

In the confusion I built for myself over the past few days I've completely started fresh aside from the first two mentioned plugins, so all E-Mail templates and order templates are stock, and any custom functions I wrote have been discarded.

Can somebody please point me in the right direction? I'm sure there's a few ways to go about this and none of my ideas are running deep enough with my limited knowledge of PHP.

Our plan is basically pretty simple. We are going to stabilize the software by first dropping a lot of dependencies, ie some modules work for as far back as v1.2 and the supported php version is 5.3. So we are going to clean out all of that and start fresh with code that is just supported in this release. Then we are going to start adding features. Features that most leading ecommerce platforms have standard, then start branching out into more advanced features. 

If you are a developer and would like to join us, please sign up on our site. We need people to help write code, design things, write documentation, all kinds of things really. 


If you are a merchant and have used PrestaShop, please tell us your pain points or problems you have encountered with it so we can try to address them in our first release. 



If you are a merchant using another platform, tell us what you love about the other platform. These could be features that we can add to ours.

ecommerce,Anyone trying or wanted to use Instagram for ecommerce sales?,"My friend and I are currently working on a tool for Instagram sellers that allows people to purchase directly from the photo/post.

If you utilize Instagram, you probably know they limit you to only one clickable link in your bio. So either 1) your customers have to click on that main store link and search through your products to find what they are looking for or 2) you place a URL into your post. They then have to copy the entire post (can’t just cut the link), paste it somewhere, then copy the actual link. 

Both ways are pretty annoying. We allow the customer to click on a post which will bring them to a replica site that you can link to all your products. So it will essentially look just like instagram, but each post takes them to the actual product, eliminating extra steps and time to get to your checkout page. There are a few companies out there that have similar tools/functionality, but cost upwards of $2000+/month. So mostly only big brands use them. We want to focus on smaller brands that may not have the budget or need extra functionalities.

Currently, we have a few small and medium sized brands beta testing. We wanted to see if anyone here would be interested in something like this.

ecommerce,Advice on validating a product,"Okay, so I have some questions that are driving me crazy. I would love to hear your thoughts. 

I'm getting started on a project and have a bit of a dilemma. Right now I'm starting an ecommerce clothing business and I have a few questions: how good should my product be before I launch a test? and am I thinking about testing in the right way? 

Background: I think there's a market for cashmere sweaters with pockets (not the actual product, but the concept is the same). To initially validate my idea, I created a ""coming soon"" landing page to advertise the product. I ran a few Facebook ads to drive traffic to the landing page and collect email addresses. The results were promising: 3 cents a click and a handful of email addresses. Because of the promising results, I decided to create an ""MVP"" batch of sweaters to get baseline conversion metrics and to see if people will actually buy the product. 

Problem: Since I wanted to move as quickly as possible, I took a few shortcuts. Instead of producing the sweater myself, I bought 25 unbranded cashmere sweaters and sewed pockets on myself. The resulting product is, in my opinion, a bit shitty. I think the sweaters will photograph well and look good on my site and in Facebook ads, but they're not the product that I had in my mind's eye. I definitely wouldn't buy them (but that's probably because I have an idea of what they could be). At the end of the day, they're just okay. 

Anyway, I have a few questions: 

1) Should I sell them anyway just to get the funnel metrics? I've already blown some $$$ on the initial batch of sweaters. I would make the next version much much better. 
2) If I do sell them, how much of an impact on brand, which is currently nonexistent, will there be if I have an unhappy customer in my ""MVP"" batch? How do I mitigate unhappiness? I plan on disabling FB comments for my page 
3) I plan on getting customers using Facebook ads. Anything I should know in advance? 
4) What's the best way to solicit feedback from initial customers?",6,3,2017-01-06,ECOM,0.027352605015039444,0.9296618103981018,0.042985543608665466

ecommerce,eCommerce - What Nobody Is Telling You,"eCommerce has become for many a promise to a better, richer, brighter future. The are thousands of hours in videos online on how to build a “7-figure-shopify-store” or “How to Get 1 cent clicks to your Shopify store” we have all seen it, from one Guru to the next everyone is posting the same information with their own little twist. Yet, how come is everyone still struggling to make those same strategies work for them?


And how come from time to time do we see what I call the “Unicorn Case”, where someone inside a group shares their success story and when asked for advice they just give you the same-old advice we have heard before. “Just hustle and make sure your Facebook Ads are on point”.

 

Com’on… we are smarter than that. We all feel there must be something MORE to it then just creating a shopify store with cheap products and good facebook ad copy.

I’m here to tell you there is actually more…

I’m here to tell you what nobody else is telling you about eCommerce.

Sit tight.

 

What nobody is telling you about eCommerce in one word is… TRUST

 

Trust is the very foundation of every single business online or offline.

Before you begin to sell ANYTHING to ANYONE in any situation you must build a relationship with that person and everyone knows relationships require trust.

 

So the first step to creating a successful eCommerce store is not building a store on Shopify. 
You must begin by interacting one-on-one with people who are already interested in the Industry you are planning to target. Then as you continue to interact with individuals you will naturally start to understand what this audience are looking for in certain products. What their pain points are, what they wished was out there in the market.

Then you actually begin to give them what they are telling you they are missing. Take what you learn from interacting from these individuals and write useful articles, give them an inspirational quote, share something funny that is relatable to them, make them feel good, make them feel they belong, whatever type of content you create make it FOR THEM.

This is the opportunity for you to be bold and put yourself in a position as the go-to guy or brand for their needs. This is not the time to offer a FREE + SHIPPING OFFER.

 

We all hate when someone just talks to us because they want to sell us something. When someone is coming to you with the pure intention the sell you something, you can actually see it coming, it’s almost like we can smell it, and it fucking stinks.

NOBODY likes to be sold to.

 

So why would you be that guy?!

 

Forget about your free + shipping offer for a second, because this is the time to build a relationship not your wallet.

 

Oddly enough, as you begin to implement this philosophy of doing business…. You begin to see you actually start making more sales by selling less.

 

This is actually how I first started making money online.

 

So back in 2015, I was struggling to find a way to actually make money online. I had watched hundreds of hours in training! Anything from SEO to e-commerce to affiliate marketing.
I was always chasing the one new thing. Nothing ever stuck. So nothing ever made me money.

 

At least not until I started to do things for others. By this point, I had mastered specific parts of doing SEO and I realized I was actually pretty good at finding good expired domains (don’t worry if you are not familiar with SEO, this is not the point) so I decided to offer my help to any member in the group.

 

What you have to understand here is that this type of help I was providing was costing them more than $400 for every client they had and most of these people had around 5 -10 clients.

So I started to get a lot of messages on facebook from people thanking me for offering such help at no cost, and I was getting message after message all saying about the same thing. It got to they point where I actually couldn’t help all the people that were messaging me.

 

This is when I decided to start charging for my services… and guess what? People actually loved it because even though they were now paying to do it for them, I was actually delivering way more than anyone else in the market.

And in a single week I made the same amount I was making with my 9-5 job. That’s when I realized the power of giving first.

 

This is the message that I want you to understand today. To build a successful e-commerce store you must begin by giving.

 

Now the question some of you may have right now is… how do I begin to give?

There are many ways to start giving to your audience so I decided that instead of creating another blog post tutorial. Instead, I’m going to launch eCom Site Duel",14,6,2017-01-07,ECOM,0.04492805525660515,0.9188123345375061,0.036259640008211136

dropship,Launching Dropship website,"Hello /dropship This is my first time posting on here

as some of you, i am also trying to break free of the enslavement system that is known as corporate america, &amp; the typical 9-5 jobs although i dont work for a corporation, and i am very happy with what im doing for work, i have been thinking about launching a dropship website, or several. i have bought a few domains &amp; hosting, i have selected a few niches for each domain, i have sourced for items for days, compiled lists of items that i would like to sell and items of interest, as well as just additional ideas.

my main concern at the moment is that, when im sourcing from AliExpress, and for example; i decide to list a pair of sunglasses or a shirt, on my website (which will be Wordpress + woocommerce) could i possibly get a copyright infringement ?

if im not including the BRAND name in the title name, and there are no trade mark logos on the shirt, or on the picture such as watermarks, would that be alright?

another example, Aliexpress often sell brand name electronics such as Lenovo and other generic brand names, if i list those on my site could i get hit with a copyright infringement?

technically.... you're selling an item you dont necessarily have in stock (unless you buy wholesale), once the item is sold, then you buy the product from the seller on Aliexpress, then they shipping it.

Accoding to the First Sale Doctorine ""The first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 109, provides that an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display or otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the interests of the copyright owner.""
i am not sure if im over thinking it, i definitely want to avoid any copyright issues,
Im almost debating private labeling something but at the same time i dont want to invest in alot of $ on a product,store it etc

I am looking for ways to improve conversations rate and increase number of reservations.


Do you think providing a discount for advance booking is a good move? Will you do it and if yes, how will you do it?


Pros i see - it can increase the number of bookings

Cons i see - it can decrease the profit per sale, it can decrease number of the last minute bookings (the customer might think why should i pay more than the 'earlier' guys)


Possible ways of implementations.

1. we can just put it on the website for everybody

2. we can show it only to guys who is not in city yet by IP filtering (who are likely to do advance booking, vs last minute booking when in the city)

3. we can show it when person selected the date he is interested in saying 'get x% off for booking y days in advance'

4. we can show it as cart saver when the person will try to leave the site.

Our average booking is 14 days in advance.

I think trying:

5% off - for 7 days in advance

10% off - for 14 days in advance

15% off - for 21 days in advance

ecommerce,He's never advertised on Facebook,"A friend of mine (and his partner) manufactures a niche aftermarket motor sports product, sells for approximately $500.  He also has built up an organic following on instagram and has an outdated ecommerce site.  He's never done Facebook advertising at all but does around $4-10k per month in sales. 

I'm looking to build a niche ecommerce brand.  The first one I'm trying is an outdoor sports apparel brand. 

I would love to reap the low hanging fruit that he hasn't captured on Facebook.  I'm willing to invest advertising dollars to do this. So far he is not. 

Option 1: Become admin on their Facebook account and start selling. I pay advertising. Work out deal where I get commissions on items I sell via Facebook using the pixel. Challenge is will be tough to get them to pay high enough commission if I'm paying for advertising, and not sure how reliable it is to track these sales.  Benefit is they already have a following.  

Option 2: Continue to create my own brand, shopify store. Sell their product using my own Facebook campaign.  Work out deal with them where I am distributor, but they fulfill orders.  


Option 2 seems cleaner.

ecommerce,Looking for the best way to go about selling products for someone else.,"Hey,

I'm in the process of starting an online store in a rather niche but large market.
I have some of my own products to sell but I have been contacted by someone else in the industry who is looking to sell his own products.

I am based in the UK and he is US. His particular product is something similar to what I am currently designing for sale over here already, but I have said that I could possibly advertise them on the store for US customers only, for him to fulfil delivery on his end.

My site will be aimed at both UK and US markets as there are digital downloads available so I feel that there is definitely opportunity for his product to gain some attention and sales.

I would probably be looking at taking some form of commission from every sale on these products. Is there a standard fee %?

Also, what kind of agreement should we have in place if this was to go ahead?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

So i want to build a platform where i have a specific product stack - Lets say for example books and i only want to sell these books in my store. Now the idea is for everyone to sign up as a seller and then CHOOSE the books one has and wants to sell so someone else can buy them. 

I took a look at a few Shopify and WooCommerce Multi-Vendor Plugins but neither did i find something really good nor have i found any info about ME (as the admin) deciding which products are to be sold. All of these plugins let the seller enter the information about the books himself whilst i only want the seller to enter the ISBN and maybe the conditions of the book and nothing more.

ecommerce,How would you approach product inventory management with primitive suppliers?,"Hi All, I have a conundrum which I am attempting to tackle and thought i'd run it past the community before I go too deep. 

So the challenge is that I have bought a dropshipping business that has roughly 50 suppliers dotted all over Australia and the suppliers aren't particularly tech savvy or proactive on the communication. What this means in practical terms is that I can have products that have changed in price, or been discontinued, or are out of stock and I won't know about it until I get an order. This could cost me a sale of $2000+. 

What I am planning to do is a massive product audit, gathering product spreadsheets from each supplier, and then cross-referencing with our own product export from Bigcommerce and spotting what products should be deleted, hidden or added. I plan to hire someone off Upwork for this task and employ them to do this process regularly. 

Obviously the preferred approach would be to have feeds from every supplier, but they are primitive af. 

I'd love to hear how you would tackle this? And please don't say dump the suppliers or pivot business as neither is practical.",5,7,2017-01-14,ECOM,0.04874926060438156,0.9225509166717529,0.028699839487671852
ecommerce,How to start your own ecommerce store if you are not from the US?,"Hey guys! How are you?

I have been reading the top posts and all have been really interesting so far. I have tried starting a couple of stores. One was related to the pet niche and other to outdoors. For the first one I ran a couple of ads but decided the product/brand was not different, Basically didnt provide any value or uniqueness. The second one I didnt bother running ads as it isnt really unique. Link to the store if you want to see: nullemoutdoors.com  Still not even tried sending traffic to it or nothing.

I want to start a brand, something unique and different. My main problem is that I live in Argentina. I have always wanted to sell to the US, but with dropshipping I cant really change the products much as contacting the supplier through alibaba and ordering the product with the changes. Plus shipping 12-20 days sucks if I dropship.

I have two options. 

1) Try to contact suppliers through aliexpress to change the items to what I want, dropship them and sell them to the US

2) Start my own brand here in Argentina (Opportunity here is endless, ecommerce is not strong here yet but people are really searching for lots of things online, checked through google keyword planner, and there are little to none stores to provide what they want). File the paperwork to become an importer and start something here.

This is insane as the contents of the package only equal to about $15-$18. I have planned to sell my product that costs me $15-$18 for 50% profit margin so I was looking at about $30ish dollars. I knew there would be a shipping charge but I did not expect it to be this large. With shipping included, the cost of everything for me to buy is going to be $35-$38. This is such a let down as I was looking to charge $30is dollars for my product.
My box is self packaged and weighs about 9lbs 3 ounces. Its dimensions are about 18x12x4 inches, and that leaves a little but of wiggle room. The cheapest shipping rate that I have found is USPS and the retail price is going to be about 20-22$. Does anyone know how I could get this down? Maybe a business account with them?

ecommerce,"Just hit my $1,000 per day revenue goal with my third attempt at a Shopify / AliExpress / FB Ads dropshipping store. Ask me anything! (except my niche/site ;)","Finally hit $1k per day revenue today after almost giving up some months ago: http://i.imgur.com/PhEL4gQ.jpg

This is the result of nearly an year's worth of learning, testing and losing almost $4,500+ in two failed stores which I had to sell on Flippa for a negligible amount. Both of these failed stores were in the clothing niche and if there's one thing I want to tell you it is this: Ali Express and clothes do not mix. NEVER sell clothing from Ali Express because of the inevitable sizing / quality headache.

I have spent countless hours watching videos on Facebook Advertising, dropped $500 on a paid FB ads / Shopify coach (Travis / Kingpinning, famous guy) and spent even more time on niche research, product selection, building out the stores on Shopify myself and managing the ad campaign, other social media such as Instagram etc and lots of other things.

With all that effort and money put in I was close to giving up with my funds almost drained but I got lucky with my 3rd and current store. 

I found the right niche / products, with very happy customers (almost no returns!), and also really nailed down FB ads as well as Instagram influencer marketing which bring in the bulk of my sales.

I have only just started scaling up some of my winning adsets / products and today is the first $1,000+ revenue day. Profit margins are usually 90 - 100% (I sell most products at almost 2x of cost) and I am spending $100 per day on advertising (FB and some Instagram) right now.

My next goal is $1,000 daily net profit / $2,000+ daily revenue either by scaling up this store further (haven't even touched Adwords etc yet) or by launching another store in another niche.",89,65,2017-01-18,ECOM,0.16910067200660706,0.8018189072608948,0.02908041886985302

ecommerce,Which e-commerce platform should a freelance dev choose?,"Hi,

I'm a freelance php dev working on WP, WooCommerce and small apps using Slim as of now.

Want to expand my skills. I have OpenCart, Prestashop and Magento in my list. Which one is the better choice, technically as well as market demand/profitability/future growth? Also, if there are more good php-based e-commerce platforms apart from these, please share.

From what I've read so far, (and please correct me since I'm still forming my impressions about these), Magento is enterprise grade, OpenCart has some issues because of their founder(?) and Prestashop might be better and kind of like between the other two in terms of scalability?

While it feels natural to me that I'll be targeting the small scale sector, but it would be nice to go with something that scales well. Magento I believe is bad for small scale, and needs specialized hosting also?

dropship,Looking to be critiqued on my business,"Hello DS redditors!

After reading some threads, I'd like to ask for a honest critique of my DS business/website.

My idea was/is motivational posters (with a twist). I want to do more than just posters, but I wanted to do an MVP first to see if things would sell. I currently have 6 different posters with some in 3 different sizes and on-top of that: Framed and Un-framed versions.

The idea came from Instagram motivational accounts. You would think: if tons of people are liking these posts and surely some would buy too...

So I created the website (shopify), and did all the graphic design myself in Photoshop. Using stock images from Unsplash and quotes that go with them.

I purchased some ads and my market is around 25-36 mostly Male. Interests: Business, Entrepreneurship, Digital Nomads etc.

I had 2 posters made, and they are quite spectacular. But just because I might buy something doesnt mean other people will too...

But I digress.


For additional info, I am posting links to the Google Analytics Console (pics). 

Total views since launched is approx 100. And although 100 isn't alot to go on yet, I still would like some feedback since my Bounce-rate is sky-high. I find it interesting that some visitors would return (I think 1-5 of them might be me though).

I am using Printful, and although their service, products are great and located in California, they are expensive (suggestions on lower-cost suppliers)?

I've designed my shop with your help -- thanks! 

You guys were all so generous in donating your time to help me and I can't thank you enough. It's great to know that as long as you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn Shopify, you can do it without spending thousands and thousands. 

A little work and perseverance certainly pays off! The hours I spent laboring over codes and tutorials has produced a store I can be proud of. But now for the selling part.

I am wondering if there are any video coures -- paid or free -- that teach the ecommerce side of things. In other words, say, targeting and setting up a Facebook campaign, what plug-ins to use for which types of stores, etc.

For something like this, I'd usually turn to a resource like Lynda. Unfortunately, they are a bit dry in this ecommerce Shopify section. So I ask you, my dear dear friends -- 



What professional ""Lynda-like"" quality video resources are out there that teach Shopify based ecommerce step-by-step for the modern, 2017, Shopify store owner?

When I called a representative, they also told me that any amount that gets released after this limit, counts as part of next month's limit too! That means if I keep going over this limit every month, I'm going to get a surplus of funds I can never touch in my PayPal account.

Have you all had experience with this? How long do I have to be with them to increase this limit?

ecommerce,"Today we just hit 1K per day with shopify/dropshipping, what we’ve learned so far","Boooom http://imgur.com/3pbe71W

I think I finally hit a point where I am able to share my modest experience and some golden nuggets to everyone in Reddit.

Started half way in november, manage to hit over 33K revenue as I’m writing and today was our first 1K per day YEY. 
 
I am still a newbie at this and learning every single day but here are the top things that helped us grow.

1. Find a business partner, someone you can work with. Someone you can bounce product ideas off and brainstorm on optimization and scaling. This is not easy and there is ALOT of work to be done. You may think you can just hire VA’s but trust me, we currently have 4 VA’s and have things semi-automated, but realistically nothing can be fully automated and still requires a lot of attention and managing. Twice the power, twice the testing and capital :slightly_smiling_face:

2. Must hire a VA for emails and orders. This took most of our days and started to stress us out. There was no way for us to grow if this continued.

3. Instructing your VA is almost more important than hiring one. Detailed instructions will prevent work from having to be redone.

4. Make automation one of your top priorities. More time = more time to strategize and grow your business.

5. Abandonement Protector. Hands down, the the best app out there. Has helped us generated over 3K since using it. 

6. Hate to repeat what everyone is saying. TEST TEST TEST. Don’t expect anything from you first $5 campaign. Use different ad formats. Gif ads have been amazing to us. Forget those lame red boarders around your ads. Remember when someone doesn’t feel like they’re buying from an ad, they are more likely to buy.

7. Learn learn learn! Not so long ago I came across the blog of a guy (you can google something like megarno shopify magician I think) selling high ticket shopify/Ecom courses at like 10% the price, so bought from him for couple hundred dollars some education material worth thousands and it was one of my best moves. I know it’s a bit a gray zone but it’s all what I could afford when I’ve just started so I don’t regret it.  

8. Cash is king - stay on top of your cash flow to ensure you can afford running ads as well as paying for cogs.

I hope this help.",32,26,2017-01-26,ECOM,0.026416728273034096,0.9207058548927307,0.05287742242217064

I was wondering which are the most important metrics when it comes to Retention for your eCommerce stores? What is the methodology that you use for tracking that? 
Do you make cohort analysis and on what basis?
Do you measure the time between orders (total, for specific segments, for specific products/product categories, combined segments and products based), and do you take better marketing decisions on that? What software do you use for that analysis?

All experience that you share would be very helpful to me!

I have ""do not allow backorders"" and ""Manage stock"" checked, but to no avail. I have even tried deleting the product and creating a new one from scratch - and yet the problem persists. We are having a hard time with this as it means we are working overtime and some orders are delayed.

dropship,Recently I made over a $988 in one week purely accidentally and with some luck,"I read reddit posts allot, I spend allot of time in my favorite subs getting ideas on this and that, mostly obsessing about how to make a living.
Recently, I was exposed to affiliate programs and drop shipping. I thought I might give it a shot, since it seemed to be a hot topic.
At the time that I was studying all that I could bare to get my eyes on, I got a product that I really loved as a Christmas gift. It's funny how odd things happen and go together.
I like to build, hack, mod, fix, and maintain stuff. Mostly odd, stuff. For instance, our expensive coffee espresso machine. It's really high tech, and cost allot of money and Jura service technicians charge a fortune for repairs (simple or high-risk repairs).
I started out posting links in few forums that I've been a member with for some time. I ranted on about how I fixed my Jura coffee machine. Well, most of my rant was asking questions and getting step by step suggestions on how to fix the darn thing. Some where in one of the links I was asked where I got my screwdriver from. I posted a social link, and a few people bought the same screwdrivers. I got a payment for referring them to the site. I posted more links on twitter, Instagram, FB... You get the point.
Fast forward - a few days later.
I came to reddit and StiffnHard answered a few of my questions, which was a big help. Thanks.
This is when the fun started, I went into drop shipping.
After getting a drop shipping account with the same company, I started posting listings on market places and also taking low key orders by way of PM or DM (on twitter). BAM! Orders started flowing in.
Went to the site, placed the orders. Orders arrived in about 3 days or less. Got some referrals from those customers and seriously a week later - I'm pulling in a G.
Stoked with the reality of this, I'm thinking about opening a shopify store. I'm thinking, that'll be another stream for revenue. Combined with the market-places, social media, craigslist, I could probably double or at least triple what I've already done. 
What do you all think about that short term plan?
Also, will this stream of cash flow stop or slow down?

I took the plunge today. I quit my only source of income. 
I have £1700 and I want to make money online, wether that's dropshipping, web design or anything really; I'm gonna go for it.

Some things I'm good at/willing to learn:
•Selling things.
•Have a very professional manner on social media which I could implement onto a website.
•Previously traded on eBay until I got suspended for no reason; which seems to be a common thing now a days.
•Willing to learn how to trade stocks.
•Willing to learn how to advertise &amp; run social media accounts.
•Open to quite a variety of things; I just want to get started with something.

I would also be quite interested in starting a local service business when the weather picks up.

What is the best thing I could do with the £1700 and some of the skills that I possess?

I also do private label, but just barely a year into that, so I'm still learning tons there.   If I'm able to answer your question I'll be sure to tag you in the comments and let you know.",6,3,2017-01-30,ECOM,0.024680158123373985,0.899422824382782,0.07589705288410187
dropship,Looking for current dropshippers with bulk ordering interested in a partnership,"New startup I'm working on has a lot to do with selling product -  But since my experience is in business - The ins and outs of dropshipping is beginning to take a toll on my patience as far as dealing with suppliers while trying to start this business. 
So what better way then just hiring individuals that are already established with there suppliers?

This is a real opportunity for current dropshippers that can vastly increase traffic to your products and/or products you can get at great prices -

Requirements -
At least a few years of dropshipping under your belt. 

Have a current website with proof of revenue(dont care about how much - just as long as you know how to operate it)

Have at least a few suppliers that can offer BULK DROPSHIPPING(ie. I will sell 100 of your products and place the entire order in 1 block)

If you are niche specific please specify which niche you would like to work with.
Please tell me a little about yourself(location/age/marital status(jk))

Little more about this -
I will be selling BULK items - Sometimes 20 in 1 order maybe 50, maybe 100. Lets say 20 would be minimum and 200 would be maximum. 
**All DROPSHIPPED FOR DIFFERENT ADDRESSES.(IE 20 ORDERS 20 DIFFERENT ADDRESS/100/50 AND SO ON)
**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART**


If you want to share prices and your margin requirements that would be helpful.
NAME BRANDS WOULD BE A PLUS

Looking for all niches with pricing no more then $200 

Please be located in the united states
Suppliers must be located in the US

I dont want to know your suppliers - I need to know the products you have or can get IN BULK that can be DROPSHIPPED

ecommerce,I Surveyed 300+ 6 &amp; 7 Figure Store Owners To Understand Who's Winning Now and Why,"Hey all, Andrew from eCommerceFuel here.  I've built and sold a few stores and now run a Community for experienced store owners.

I surveyed 300+ high 6 and 7 figure store owners this Fall to figure out what's working and what's not in eCommerce, and just released my results in what I'm calling the State of the Merchant.

A few interesting stats:

- Companies that are manufacturing their own products are growing 50%+ faster than retailers / dropshippers.

- The average store owner surveyed has revenues of approx. $750K and makes $132K in profit. 

- Pet Supplies, Beauty, Tools and Home Improvement are the best converting categories.  Electronics, Home, Jewelry and Clothing are the worst.  The overall average conversion rate is 2.10%.

- Stores in Europe and Australia have significantly higher conversion rates than those in the States.

- Despite it's dominance, most merchants (51%) still aren't selling on Amazon.  

- 55% of store owners would rather be attacked by an angry swarm of bees vs. a wild, hungry bear.  (This was an actual survey question).

- The average store owner has a net worth 5x larger than average.

There's a bunch more stats which you can see at the full post linked to below.  I also created a detailed info-graphic summarizing the data in case you're more of a scanner.

Finally, I'm releasing the entire raw data set as well.  So if you want to slice and dice the data yourself - or investigate some other areas (there's more than 50 data points for each store owner) - you're able to.

dropship,ePacket expands to 30 countries!,"**The biggest problem with selling products from China:**

* All of you out there doing dropshipping most likely use the free shipping method = all your customers get pissed off for 30-40-60 days before their package arrives. That is all about to change (for a lot of locations)! 

* Honestly, the biggest setback for this style of ecommerce is the long shipping = customers don't trust you = you don't make sales. Having to write ""typical shipping is between 3 and 7 weeks"" on your site turns away an enormous amount of customers. Not to mention the absolute headache you get from all your customers being pissed off when their package hasn't arrived or their tracking is slow.

**Why you should be excited**

* ePacket has expanded to cover 30 more countries! For those that don't know, ePacket is an extremely cheap shipping service that is offered by merchants in China / Hong Kong. It basically means you can ship products to countries in 2-3 weeks vs 4-6 weeks. Not only that, it also has **BETTER TRACKING**. You can easily set it up so that your customers get emails in real time updating them on the progress of their package. This. Is. Huge.

**These are the countries that now have epacket - time to update your ad demographics!**

* Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibralta, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States.

ecommerce,what comparison services do you use?,"Hello reddit,



I have developed a module that helps with data export from webstore. The module is quite versatile, you can generate any data you want. However to prepare a proper template can take some time. Especially if the resulting xml/csv file must meed some criteria, such as allowed characters in product id, etc.



One of the main use case is to generate a feed for comparison services. In order to make this module more usable, and to save user's time, I'd like to add some default templates for most commonly comparison services, so my users can integrate with them with a single click of mouse.



I've already created templates for Google Merchant centre, and for the biggest comparison services in my country - seznam.cz, heureka.cz



If you could share with me what comparison services you use, it would be very helpful. Also, if you export data from your shop for any other purpose, I'd love to hear about that. 



PS: I won't share link to module, as this is not a self-promotion post. PM me if you would like to know more details",2,3,2017-01-31,ECOM,0.019549572840332985,0.9355953931808472,0.04485505074262619
ecommerce,How to make a one time QR code for tickets?,"I've done extensive research for at least two hours, but I can't find what I need.

I'm setting up an online store in Shopify (at this stage) that provides people with daily deals around the city of their choice. These deals may be something like:

* Get 50% off at Sushi Today
* Get free fries on Friday at Burger Box

My issue is that I only want people to be able to scan their ticket ONCE. I don't want people to re-print their ticket and take it to the store to redeem the offer a second time (or more), as they've only purchased it once. 

The most promising thing I've found is Scanova (http://scanova.io/index.html), but I wouldn't mind something a little less expensive. I'd be running in excess of 20 deals concurrently (as there's various cities), and that would mean I have to subscribe to the pro plan.

I can't believe I've found this so difficult to find. How do I make a QR code that's only valid for one use? Maybe I'm searching the wrong things.

I'd love a Shopify plugin (or Squarespace), and the most promising one is Evey Event Management, but they cost $20 per event per month. As I said, this cost would be ridiculous per month because I'd be up in excess of 20 ""events"".
