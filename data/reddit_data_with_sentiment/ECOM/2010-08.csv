ecommerce,Need a shopping cart that keeps track of unused portions of coupons. Can anyone recommend? [More inside],"I'm in the market for a shopping cart provider who not only can let me issue coupon codes, but can also let customers save unused portions of their coupons.

In other words, if someone buys a $20 coupon but then only buys $15 worth of stuff from my site, the shopping cart provider should ""save"" the left-over $5 so that the customer can use it by entering the same code during a subsequent purchase.

My current cart can issue coupons, but for unused portions of a coupon the only thing I can do is manually issue a new code. I'm about to do a promotion involving 200 coupons so I do NOT want to have to keep track of all that myself!

Can anyone recommend an advanced (but relatively affordable) shopping cart with the functionality I've just described?",2,3,2010-08-14,ECOM,0.023038310930132866,0.9414451718330383,0.03551653027534485

ecommerce,"Anyone ever write articles for ""article sites""  to promote their own business or website? [crossposted to /r/smallbusiness]","Theoretically, writing articles is a good way to advertise your expertise in your field and to promote your site directly (with a link).

I've written for American Chronicle, but the problem is the article page doesn't have an outgoing link to my site -- readers have to go to my author page, then click on ""Author's site"" (which is too many clicks and thus a nonstarter as far as I'm concerned).

Can anyone recommend other article sites based on their own experience?
