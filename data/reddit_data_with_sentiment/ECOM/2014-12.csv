ecommerce,"Just got a bunch of possible fraudulent orders, what should we do?","Over this weekend, we received a bunch of suspicious orders from random countries that were not placed in the same countries as shown in the billing addresses.  BigCommerce labels them ""Possible Fraudulent  Orders.""

I noticed that a lot of people were being directed to our site from a forum on altenen.com.  After doing a[ little bit of research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud#Carding), I came to the understanding that altenen.com is a community for credit card scammers, and our website was posted as a ""cardable site.""

I have a few questions for anybody that has advice to offer:

1. How can we double check to see which orders are legit and which orders are from scammers?
2. How can we warn the owners of these credit cards that somebody's using their stolen credit card numbers? 
3. Which authorities can we report this to?  
4. How can we protect our website in the future to not be considered a ""cardable site"" by scammers?

ecommerce,"Mass Customization: Geschichte, Entstehung + Vorteile","Was ist Mass Customization?
Mass Customization, auch als kundenindividuelle Massenproduktion bezeichnet, ist ein Produktionskonzept, bei dem einerseits die Vorzüge der Massenproduktion genutzt werden und andererseits dem wachsenden Wunsch des Kunden nach Individualisierung seines Produktes Rechnung getragen wird.

 

Massenware auf den Kunden zugeschnitten: Geht das überhaupt?
Viele Menschen der älteren Generation werden dieses Gefühl noch gut kennen: Massenware vom Fließband - wie Konserven oder Waschmittel - konnte man immer schnell und günstig erwerben. Doch sollte es etwas individueller oder ausgefallener sein, wurde es sehr schnell teuer und die Zeit bis zur Fertigstellung lang.

Auch heute noch lebt die Industrie vom Fließband, viele Produkte sollen in kurzer Zeit zu günstigen Preisen angeboten werden können. Sobald aber individuelle bzw. persönliche Kundenwünsche ins spiel kommen, wird es gleich merklich teurer.

Doch in der heutigen Zeit des sich immer schneller entwickeln technologisch Fortschrittes ist es nun möglich, automatisierte Prozesse individueller zu gestalten um aus dem festgefahrenem System der Massenproduktion auszubrechen. Der Kunde erstellt sich mit einer Konfiguratoren-Software sein Produkt nach Maß, welches dann im laufendem Prozess der Produktion einfach berücksichtigt wird, ohne dass es dadurch teurer wird.

Die junge ""Generation Facebook"" schätzt in diesem Prozess vor allem eines: Mit den individuell gestalteten Produkten können sie sich von der Masse abheben und ihr selbst erstelltes Produkt in den Social-Media-Kanälen vorführen. Dagegen schätzt die ältere Generation eher die Funktionalität der Produkte, wie den Komfort maßgeschneiderter Schuhe oder Lebensmittel für Allergiker.

 

Was bringt die Zukunft?
Der Trend, sein Unternehmen nach Mass Customization auszurichten, hat in den letzten Jahren einen wahren Boom erfahren, der so schnell nicht wieder abreißen wird. Dieser Trend ist sogar schon so weit, dass Kunden ihre über eine Software selbst erstellten Produkte bequem von Zuhause aus an einem 3D-Drucker ausdrucken können. Oder denken Sie einfach an die vielen T-Shirt- und Möbel-Konfiguratoren, die bereits auf dem Markt sind. Wir sind gespannt, was die Zukunft im Mass-Customization noch bringt und wo der Trend uns noch hinführt.

ecommerce,eBay to my own site.,"Hi everyone I hope this is the best place to post this.

I have been selling little over 7 months on eBay was going good so far everything in one place etc.

Now it is turning out that 

1. Ebay is not gonna allow me to sell certain products on their site.

2. Small percentage of buyers have learned to game the ebay system. They buy a product say its defective after they have received it and they dont have to return it if they open a case and ebay refunds them the money. This leads to my topseller discount dissapring along with my top rated badge.

2.1 loosing the toprated also causes me spots on eBay search engine.

2.2 Competitors can cause your business to come to a stand still on ebay.

3. Final value discount is important on invoices because it covers all overheads and you lose the discount  if you lose toprated status.

So i have decided to launch my own e-commerce site.

1. I can sell whatever I want.

2. Dont have to worry about competition screwing with my ratings.

3. Don't have to worry about customer ripping me off because, i will have control over returns and exchanges.

But I am having trouble deciding where to start.
Because initially these ecommerce companies  (shopify etc.) lead me to believe that i pay one flat fee and i have my site up and running.

Now it turns out that I also need shipping and payment gateway both of them require a monthly fees and percentage per transaction.

Does anyone know what might be the most economical way transition from ebay to my own site?

I calculate ebay+PayPal fees around 12% per transaction for me. It is around 16% when I dont get my top rated discount.

And that does not include overhead from ebay returns etc. and ebay forcing me to pay return shipping and i get stuck with used or wrong products being returned.

Can anyone reccomend the best e commerce web solution for my situation? Far as saving on fees and still having things like integrated shipping to start.

ecommerce,4 steps to make advertising work for your online store,"I finally convinced my friend I could help him fix this.


We were sitting in a coffee shop, looking at the screen of his laptop. 


It had been a while since I’d seen Steve. He had been working as a consultant for the last 4 years, slowly moving up the ranks.


""The work still is really interesting, I'm well paid and working with big companies."" But something was missing.


Over the years he had a growing feeling that he wanted to do something different. Not a new job in a different company, but something of his own.


After a lot of thinking he had decided to act on the feeling. That’s why he bought an online store a couple of months back.


Ecommerce was a whole new world for him. So during the first months he had been learning the basics of products, pricing and promotion. Afterwards he had tried to grow the store any way he could.


“Advertising doesn’t work for me.” Steve said.


He knew I’d be asking him about this because that’s what I do for a living: running advertising campaigns for other clients.


“It’s way too expensive for me to get new customers. I’ve spent a lot of money and the sales just aren’t there.”


After talking to him for a while he got more silent.


“I am ashamed of the amount of money I have thrown away.” he said quietly. I looked at the totals on the screen and quickly did the math. About $4500 spent on advertising, slowly trickled out over the last 6 months.


I told him I had seen this before. It is easy to spend money on ads, but getting a return for it can be damn hard.


From what I had seen about his store and his numbers, I knew that there was room for improvement, lots of it. So I offered to help him turn things around. 


From his enthusiasm it was clear that he wanted his store to succeed more than anything. It was his dream for a different kind of life, one where he would be in charge of his job!


So we got to work.  



**Step 1: trimming the fat**


“Advertising is a numbers game”, I told him.


""You put money in, more has to come out.""


If that equation doesn't work there are 2 reasons. Or you put in too much money, or not enough has come out.


He had spent the biggest chunk on Adwords campaigns so we started investigating where he could trim his advertising spending.


Luckily he had enabled the conversion tracking so we could see which campaigns and keywords brought him sales, and which didn’t.


After seeing hundreds of Adwords accounts one thing had become clear to me. The main goal of Google’s advertising platform was to make Google more money. And in the process they made it hard for business owners to avoid the pitfalls the search giant had set up.


“On Adwords, there are three magic tweaks” I said. “These do not only limit your spending, but make sure you get more qualified visitors to your site”.


* Switch off the Display network and **limit your campaigns to the Search Network**. You want your ads to appear next to relevant search queries, not on video sites, games or random mobile apps.
* **Add negative keywords**. Monitor the actual keywords that your advertisements trigger. If keywords seem irrelevant, be sure to block them. This prevents unqualified visitors from ever seeing your ads.
* Use narrower **match types**: People usually put a lot of thought into the keywords they want to appear next to.  But by default, Google will use broad match. This means that they will show your ad when people are looking for other keywords as well. This includes synonyms and misspellings, but Google takes this way too far. They will try to show your ad for any search query that is even remotely relevant. If your keyword is about sport shoes, they will include any type of shoe or sports equipment.


30 minutes later, we had finished making the necessary changes to Steve’s Adwords account.


His face was a mix of disbelief and confusion. Seeing the actual keywords and websites he had wasted his money on, it sank in how unaware he had been doing it all wrong.


I didn’t give him much time to fully process that, because we were on a mission!  



**Step 2: figuring out whom we are selling to**


“Who are you trying to reach?” I asked him. 


“Everyone that needs the products that I sell”, Steve answered.


I had seen this before. Store owners get busy running their business and forget the most essential thing, their customers.


“Who is it that buys from you? Are they men or women? Young or old? Students or young parents? Geeks or car lovers? Seniors?”


He knew exactly who was buying from him. Young people between 17 &amp; 25 who love outdoor music festivals.


“Why do they buy from you?” I asked.


“Most of them need some new gear for a music festival they’re going to. Or they want to buy a little gadget as a gift.”


A lot of store owners know who buys from them and why, but they don’t show it in the design of their website, the language they use, the product images or the products they sell.


""When a qualified visitor lands on your website, he should feel at home and know that this is his kind of site.""


When I finished telling this to my friend he understood what I was talking about.


He was selling the right products, but his images and language were not at all connecting with his target customers.


A lot of business owners are afraid to choose one type of customer to focus on, because that means they’ll reach fewer people.


But what would you rather have: a store that targets everyone and sells to no one, or one that speaks to a small group of people that love everything about your site and your products.


This wasn't a small tweak we could make in 5 minutes. There were hundreds of little details he could change to get a better fit with his audience.


But we were on the right path. We’d made sure to attract more relevant visitors and improved his site to connect better with them.


Now it was time to see how we could get more of these visitors to buy.  



**Step 3: clear the path for your visitor**


Instead of just visitors, Steve needed more buyers on his website. People that add products to their carts and complete the checkout process.


Although an important part of a store, it is one that gets little attention.


People usually use the default options that are part of their ecommerce platform.


Looking at the whole shopping experience, there are two big parts:


First we try to inform people, introduce them to our products and help them select the right one. And then, when they’ve made up their minds, we have to get out of the way and make it as easy as possible for those visitors to buy.  


To know which part of Steve’s store wasn’t doing well, we calculated 2 ratios that would tell us where to focus our attention:

* **Ratio add to carts/visitors**: how many visitors add something to their cart?
* **Ratio sales/add to carts**: how many of the people that added something to their cart actually make a purchase?


His sales/add to carts ratio was the smallest so we started there.


Depending on the platform your online store uses, there are a lot of differences in length and layout of the checkout process. But there usually is one step that causes a lot of visitors to bail.


Finding and fixing it will do wonders for your sales, and it will increase the impact of any marketing campaign you run for your store.


I put myself in the shoes of a potential customer on my friend’s site. While I was going through the process I started thinking out loud: what I saw, what confused me and what I didn’t understand.


When I was done, Steve had already written down 10 ideas to tweak this process.


I told him to do this more often: ask people you know or even strangers to visit your website and talk through it. You’ll quickly and cheaply get feedback on how you can improve the process.


The biggest hurdles for visitors usually are when they have to fill in some information.


But his store, a lot of people were leaving the checkout process when they discovered the shipping cost. Until she went through the checkout, a visitor on his site had no idea about what it would cost to ship the products.


So a lot of people started checking out just to see the actual price.


I smiled. This was very valuable.


“How so?” he said. “I can’t afford to offer free shipping, so I want only the people that are genuinely interested to see the actual shipping costs.”


“Just be straightforward with your customers. If you can't offer free shipping, be transparent about it up front. That way your customers don't have the feeling that they're being cheated.""   



**Step 4: Have a backup if she says no**


People usually don’t propose on a first date. It takes time to find out what makes the other person tick.


The commitment is smaller, but the same goes for your store. Convincing visitors that have never heard from you or your store to buy on their first visit is hard.


My friend’s store had only been around for a year and he hadn’t made a lot of sales. So few of the people landing on his website knew about the brand.


Visitors that are looking for a specific product might do some more research and come back later. They ask a couple of friends where they bought their gear or visit competitor sites to compare products.


Other visitors might not be ready to buy yet. They land on your site expecting something else or are just getting to know what’s out there.


In fact, on average only 2% of all visitors make a purchase. 


That means that the group of people that are *just looking* is a lot bigger.


So you have to find ways to increase those odds.


“How can we do that?” Steve asked.


“There are two tactics that I always implement. They are easy to set up and can dramatically improve results.”


When people are visiting your site, get them to leave their email address. Promise them exclusive deals or useful information in exchange. If you send a newsletter to them, you'll have multiple opportunities to sell to them.


Retarget them. You might have seen advertisements on Facebook or on other websites with the product you were looking at last night. Some people find it annoying, but companies do this because it works.


“Even if this is the only thing you implement, customers interact more with your brand and it will increase the odds of people buying from you.”


A silence fell while he processed all of this. We'd been sitting and talking for two hours straight. His head, and mine as well, was buzzing.


“So when are you going to switch your ads back on?” I asked him.


“Well, first I’ve got some homework to do”, Steve said smiling as he glanced at his notebook. “But I just know I can get this to work. Slowly this time and by keeping a close eye at the money in and money out”.


I knew he had a lot of work to do. But I felt good knowing that I had managed to give some new energy to his dream.",0,1,2014-12-09,ECOM,0.03269825565318266,0.9089178641637167,0.058383879562218986

shopify,"Reddit: How customizable is Shopify, really?","Hi all. I am a 21 year old engineering student that was fortunate enough to get an internship at an e-commerce startup over the summer, and I quickly fell in love with all the possibilities that surround the e-commerce ecosystem. I had no previous experience as a developer, and I was hired as a business analyst and quickly went on to take all the business intelligence responsibilities, including learning some SQL and mastering excel. 

Now that you know my background, here is my problem: I want to set up my own online store, and after ingesting as much information as I could through blogs, podcasts etc. I am still not sure which path would be the best to follow. I started out by quickly teaching myself HTML+CSS (which I enjoyed immensely - I had to take a basic C++ course in school, and front-end development is something completely new to me) and figuring out what I want my website to look like. I like the long-format websites (see: www.cookitboutique.com) but I also have another dilemma: my store would be a subscription-based service, where the customer can select 6 items every month to be shipped to their homes. 

Can this be built on Shopify? Should I try to build this myself by mastering HTML+CSS and learning Javascript? Or can I get this from a theme? I like the California theme on Shopify, but I am not sure I will be able to customize it enough to get it to what I described above. 

Should I jump straight to Magento? What are your thoughts?",8,1,2014-12-10,ECOM,0.021923677995800972,0.9260451793670654,0.05203110724687576

shopify,Is there any way to enter numerical data for your products?,"Hey,

I am wondering if there is any way of entering in numerical data for your products. For example, if I am selling books, some books have 115 pages, others have 152 pages, some have 172 pages, etc.

Is there any way of taking my book product, having a property called ""Pages"" that takes an numerical (integer) value? 

The solution does **not** seem to be to add the number of pages as a type. Because types are understood as words/strings, and not as numbers. In result, even if you entered in the number of pages as a type for every single book, you would not be able to sort by ""more than 100 pages"", since the # of pages (as types) is treated as a string (a word) and not actually as a number, so you cannot do mathematical operations on them.

dropship,"I have a few products and a few suppliers, now what?","I'm a total noob to this, been looking into it a while.

I basically see it happening a few ways: some people buy access to lots of dropship suppliers online, then repost the products for small markups. But lots of people can have the same stuff.

Some people research online and find a place that dropships already, or at least ships to the USA and around, and deal directly with them and post their products.

I'm in Asia and have access to some suppliers.  A few questions:

How hard is it to ""dropship"" with a company that doesn't already export?  Would I more or less need to pay an exporter, or do it myself?  

Let's assume I find a good supplier to some bulk items, I get good photos and they already export bulk.  Where do people most commonly sell?  Just amazon and big markets? Or trying to contact shopping centers or whoever the bulk customers would be in the USA directly?

woocommerce,Send user a custom (random) url after confirmed purchase?,"I can't find a solution anywhere, but here is what I'd like to do. 

I have about 500 url's that all link to random ""scratch cards"" 
Example:

URL 1 = Winner
URL 2 = Loser
URL 3 = 10% off

What we are trying to do is once an order is set to processing (once payment is received), when we confirm the payment we send a notification email to the customer noting that their order is in progress and include a custom random URL with this notification. 

The process is as follows:

1. User purchase product

2. Order is set to processing

3. We review the order and accept it. 

4. Order is set to In Progress - a custom random URL is sent out to the buyer

5. Buyer goes to URL, fills out form + random benefit

6. Form is Reviewed

7. Order is marked Completed. 



All i've found so far is the order notes coding change to have them show within the orders notification emails, however they show ALL of the order notes which looks messy. 

I can't find a plugin or code anywhere for this. 

Primary goal is to send the user a custom and ramdom URL from a set list automatically while selecting an ""In Progress"" order status.

ecommerce,Looking to transition fulfillment to amazon or a like company - seeking advice,"Hi All,

I started an ecommerce site back in march. Right now I do all fulfillment in-house. I order stock routinely and store what I can fit in my residence. 

I am now to a point where I have built up enough capital to start expanding and buying more inventory and add to the current selection without any outside investment. 

I have a good paying full-time job that I am not willing to leave as I am not making enough from the site. I would however like to start outsourcing warehousing and fulfillment. 

I was thinking about going with Amazon and just getting my SKUs and barcodes in order. Plan would be to order inventory to my residence, QA the inventory, send QA passed inventory off to Amazon or a like company for warehousing and fulfillment. 

Info:

* 15 - 40 orders per week
* 3 products with 30 varieties (size / color) 
* International shipping, but could definitely switch to domestic only
* Shopify site

Does anyone have any experience with Amazon fulfillment and have any advice on how to get started? Anyone have any experience with a like company such as shipwire? Any idea what I should expect for  costs? How badly will it eat into my margin. 

My products end up costing me 2.50/unit and I sell them for $12 avg a unit. I pass the cost of shipping onto the customer.

ecommerce,Secret Store Business proving key contributor to Indian ecommerce,"In any country, there are key economic indicators which can show the trend for the national economy. In the United States, this includes the number of housing starts. In other countries, this could be the sale of a specific consumer item, like computers or beer. In India, there is a basket of goods which comprise the consumer price index, any of the items on the list can be considered as a key economic indicator. The way things are going, one of these days, lingerie can become one of those items, even if informally.

Economic Sector Indicator

Although it is not far-fetched, the sale of lingerie per se may not be a good indicator for the economy as a whole. Rather, the sale of lingerie by secret store businesses can be an indicator for growth within some sectors of the economy. Specifically, the sectors this represents include the young adults, in their early twenties, to the early thirties, who are upwardly mobile, and employed in the corporate sector. In addition, this same segment of the market can be used as an indicator for the buying power of women in the middle- to upper class market. These are the segments which are creating waves when they do online lingerie shopping in India.

These segments of the market have shown to be have a rapid growth in disposable income, which translates to buying power as well as savings. The growth of the corporate sector in the past 10 to 15 years has made an enormous impact on lifting this segment of the population, and in the economy as a whole.

Leading the Economy

There is a boom in the lingerie market. Whereas the traditional low-end of the market was mainly home-made or poorly made, this was also the portion of the market which sold the most. However, the biggest growth in recent years is in the premium and super-premium market.

Growth and Trends

Online stores, as well as foreign brands have taken a foothold and helped push the market to new heights. From 2009 to 2014, the total lingerie market had a compounded annual growth rate of 18.3%. The women’s lingerie market comprises 52% of the volume but 66% of the value of sales. The higher average selling price accounts for the difference. The growth rate in the past five years has fueled speculation that the women’s lingerie market can become the next fashion trend.

What fuels the growth is the growing purchasing power of women, as well as the formerly mid-market young adults. In any growing economy, it is expected that affluence would push the selling power of the lower income classes to upgrade from the mass-market and economy product lines to the mid-market. In the same manner, the traditional mid-market is also expected to upgrade to the premium and super-premium. In the case of the Indian lingerie industry, the percentage of the mass-market and economy segments has maintained their market shares, while the premium and super-premium market have grown a lot.

Thinking about the Future

There is no doubt that with the continuing growth of the economy, it would also continue to feed the growth in the lingerie industry. With that in mind, there seems to be no end in sight for the upscale lingerie manufacturers, as well as the rest of the branded major players. The online stores have also made plans to take advantage of the expected growth and are signing up more foreign high-end labels. As a fashion statement, there is a lot of growth which can still be expected from the Indian lingerie.",0,1,2014-12-16,ECOM,0.0193721204996109,0.8849557638168335,0.0956721156835556

The Reynolds Company is one of the leading electrical supply wholesale distributors in the US. We helped them take their site live this November with CIMM2 at the helm. We wanted to know how they found CIMM2 and so after a quick check they came back to us with impressive results. Their new site was doing extremely well, in the very first month they’d seen a 2x increase in the number of sessions and a 3x increase in the number of visitors and page views they were receiving. We were also happy to learn that CIMM2’s mobile optimization was helping them get more than 2x the number of visitors from mobile devices, and desktop traffic too had doubled in a single month. And this gives a great fillip to their omni-channel ecommerce strategy.
SupplyFORCE is a leading provider of Maintenance Repairs and Operations (MRO) supplies and has been using CIMM2 to power their eCatalog and eCommerce capabilities for over two years now. Recently their chief operating officer, John Ludlam, told us why they’d chosen CIMM2 over other ecommerce platforms when they had to make the decision.He told us how only CIMM2 was the only platform that owned and offered all the capabilities they were looking for.

ecommerce,The Definitive Guide to eCommerce Discounting,"Discounts, used properly, can be a powerful addition to your eCommerce toolkit. They have the capacity to make your online business significantly more profitable. But to get it right you need a bit of psychology, some sound business analysis, and ideally some smart technology.

Offering discounts might not seem the most obvious way to make your eCommerce business more profitable. And if you approach discounting without a clear plan, or the tools to evaluate whether it’s working and the wider impact on your business, you might just be foregoing margin for no benefit.

DISCOUNTING IS A STRATEGIC ISSUE FOR ANY ECOMMERCE BUSINESS AND NEEDS TO BE APPROACHED WITH THE RIGHT METHODICAL MIND-SET
I’m sure you don’t need me to remind you that selling online is almost always highly price-sensitive. So a clear pricing strategy that includes intelligent discounting is essential if you want to achieve anything like your potential sales and profits.

Remember your brand

But before you go and apply discounts indiscriminately across your product range to create more sales, think about the effect on your brand. There is a well-known furniture retailer that is famous for having near perpetual sales. They are probably quite successful; but do buyers really believe they are getting a top class sofa at a bargain price? Would a brand like that ever be able to move into a more upmarket, higher margin market?

Discounting needs a lot of thought and planning - and here are some points you need to consider.

What type of discount?



Ultimately, there are only three types of discount:

A percentage discount on a product (which could be 100%)
A cash amount discount on a product
Get a product for a fixed, reduced price
Where the complexity - and art - comes about in setting up your discount comes is both setting up the discount’s conditions:

“spend £50 or more…..”
“buy one of these….”
“buy any 2 products in our seating range”
“enter the discount code FREESTUFF at checkout”
And determining what elements get discounted when the conditions are met:

… and get free delivery
… and get one free!
… and get 10% off your entire purchase
If your eCommerce platform offers you the ability to control the conditions and application of discounts - and it should - then you can start to tailor your offers in the way that produces the maximum results for your business. The most popular options used by our customers are these:

Free delivery - this can be as a one-off offer or triggered when you spend over a certain amount.
Specific cash amount discounts
% discounts
Multi-buy and volume-based discounts - which can also be linked to free delivery
Combination offers - buy several items together at a special price or ‘get the look’ for £50
BOGOF or its many variants
Free gifts over a certain spend
Discounts can be applied to the entire cart or individual items and they can be time-limited. You can also trigger a discounted price on an item when a related product is placed in the cart - if you have the right tools.

Do we really need so many options? Yes we do. Different products and different customers respond better or worse to different approaches. Having one discounting technique is like trying to win The Open with just a putter in your bag.

Your room for manoeuvre with eCommerce discounting is largely governed by the capabilities of your CMS. If you have to apply (and remember to remove) discounts manually, your flexibility will be very restricted.

The most effective discounting model for a particular business may is not always intuitive or predictable, and some models have a greater appeal for particular customers. For B2B, for example, volume-based discounts are often the most effective; a business buyer can understand the logic and see how shipping multiple items in one package reduces costs - the value of the offer is clear. Volume-based discounts are also not likely to dilute a premium brand.

The more flexibility your CMS allows, the more opportunity you will have to implement the discounts that will have the most appeal and drive the behaviour you want.

Reasons for Discounting



The value of discounting is much more sophisticated than just increasing sales volumes. Overstocking and clearing obsolete lines are common triggers for discounts. Others relate to customer service and cash-flow.

Discounting can influence a number of key business metrics. Every day that you hold an item in stock has a cost. You have to provide physical space, heat, light and staff on top of the wholesale price. When you factor in the cost of the capital you have tied up in stock, you may well make a different financial decision than if you just analyse the gross margin on each product you sell.

The difference between being a real eCommerce business and a business that sells things online often comes down to how well back-end systems work together and integrate with the online store. You need to understand how the entire business works before you can have a really intelligent pricing and discount strategy.

Take volume-based discounts as an example. If you don’t understand how much it really costs to pick, pack and ship individual items, what basis do you have for creating volume-based discounts that make financial sense? Do you just pick a number that sounds about right?

Discounting can have a direct impact on stock turn, which is another key measurement for any business with significant sales volumes.

Discounting also works well for customer re-engagement, both with abandoned carts and with existing customers who haven’t visited your site for a while.

Results with abandoned cart emails can be spectacular. If you additionally offer a discount, you can tell those customers that you really want their business and potentially negates any price comparisons they may have done since viewing the item on your site.

Exclusive discount codes for customers who haven’t returned to your site for a while can also have very high conversion rates if they are properly targeted based on sound CRM data. It’s usually effective to make these offers time-limited to create a bit of urgency. Leaving people with the option to use a discount at an unspecified later date usually means they don’t do it at all.

Why measuring is so important

I said earlier that the effects of different discount models are not always intuitive or easy to predict. We ran an email campaign with one client that offered every recipient a discount code qualifying them for free delivery on their next purchase, irrespective of the value. We split-tested this with a similar campaign that offered free delivery on their next purchase if they spent more than £50.

Which one do you think was more successful? Interestingly, the second option significantly outperformed the first. The only difference was in the condition required to qualify for the discount - enter a code, or spend a fixed amount - and exactly how this played out in individual minds is not obvious. Our belief in this case is that the target demographic behind the campaign was not comfortable or experienced using vouchers or discount codes to qualify for discounts, and were more familiar with spending an amount to qualify. This is why knowing your customer base is so important.

What it also says is that the terms of the discount have to be crystal clear to have the maximum effect on sales. It also underlines the importance of perception. Some customers may perceive free delivery to be better value than an equivalent cash discount - and some might think the opposite.

It’s not just about cutting the price

The way your eCommerce site presents discounts has a massive impact on the success of the campaign.

First off, there’s no point implementing discounts unless you make it clear. Have a look at how Brunel Engraving highlights discounts on its best-selling items:



The flashes across the photos and the strike-throughs make it clear that deals are available and what they are.

The strikethrough approach is continued into the product views as you can see here:



In fact it’s always a good idea to keep the discount on view right through the journey from product selection to check-out. At no point do you want the customer to be wondering whether what they are seeing is the original or the discounted price - this just causes doubt, delay and abandoned purchases.

And finally you can see how the site handles multi-buy discounts:



Note how they show the percentage discount, unit price and the saving per item. The discounted price is crystal clear.

And finally, when the product is in the cart:



Not only do we show the original price and discounted price against each product, but we show the overall saving achieved in the totals. Order confirmation screens and emails show the same lines.

This is another critical, underestimated element of discounting - effectively communicating to your customers the discounts that have been applied.

If a customer expects a discount and it isn’t clear that they have been awarded it, they will often question the amounts they’ve paid. If that happens, you’ve lost out on two counts where you should only be winning: a customer questioning your prices is not as happy as one who knows that they’ve got a bargain, and your precious time is now spent investigating the order and managing the customer rather than fulfilling their order.

Measuring what works



I’m sure you knew we’d end up here eventually. Successful eCommerce means understanding what works, which means you have to be able to measure it. Setting up goals in Analytics and measuring real-time data will tell you whether your discounts are driving the behaviour you wanted.

Similarly A/B split testing can quickly tell you which type of discount and which methods of presentation are most effective.

If your discounts are not actually increasing sales, all you are doing is throwing away margin. If that’s the case you want to recognise it and try something else as quickly as possible!

Where do people go wrong?

There are many reasons why discounting might not deliver the business results that people hoped for. Here is a brief checklist of common issues:

Showing a discount box when there are no active discounts. This potentially tells your customer that somebody else may be getting a discount that they haven’t been offered. When you have live discount codes you probably have to show the box in the check-out for all customers, but why invite resentment when there are no codes to use?

There’s also a risk that somebody will do a Google search for discount codes before completing the purchase. And once they are in the ‘land of Google’, who knows where they’ll end up.

Offering an easy to find but trivial value discount code can be a useful tactic to get around this issue.

Not keeping customers in the picture. Show them the discount they are getting and why they are getting it, right through the purchase process. This reminds them that they are getting a deal, and confirms how much they are saving when they hit the ‘buy now’ button right through to order confirmation.

Assuming one size fits all. We’ve talked about the variety of discounts and the many ways they can be employed. These have evolved for a good reason: different customers respond positively to different offers. You’ll only know what works best for your customers by experimenting and measuring.

Hopefully this has convinced you that discounting is a strategic issue for any eCommerce business and needs to be approached with the right methodical mind-set. It’s an important area where your eCommerce agency should be helping you by providing the right expertise and tools to deliver the results you need.

**Do I need a Tax ID to work with dropshippers if I'm outside the US?**

&amp;nbsp;

Anyone from anywhere can purchase access to our Membership and still get a lot of benefit. 60%-70% of our listed wholesale suppliers will work with international retailers. That means over half of our 8,000 listed suppliers will work with you! If you are interested in a specific country, and only want to work with wholesale suppliers in that country, you are welcome to contact customer support and they will check for you. **Keep in mind, that since International rules differ from the US, there is no tax ID involved like you would need for the USA. So you will typically not need a tax ID in order to work with US wholesale suppliers. However, you will still need to obtain a registered business name and any other documentation required to prove you are a legitimate retailer. So you will need to check with your country or region to see what you need to show you are a genuine retailer.** Quick tip! In a search engine, type Starting a business in XXXX and replace the X’s with your country name. There are a lot of great free resources out there that will provide you with what you need to know.

ecommerce,The 3 Ecommerce Apps you Need Right Now,"The holidays are heating up – meaning you are running low on spare time and pulling in (hopefully) lots and lots of orders. Here are the three apps you need this season and beyond to help you manage your stores and enjoy the holidays.

Shopify Mobile

If you have a Shopify store, then you need to download their free mobile app. Designed to operate exactly as the desktop version, Shopify mobile will allow you to run your store and keep an eye on orders when you are traveling this season. From your phone, you’ll be able to receive order notifications via text or email, update in-store products and prices with connection to Shopify POS, fulfill orders or contact a customer, manage your inventory, take and upload a photo, delete an old product, change a price, etc. Like Shopify’s desktop version, Shopify mobile connects you with free 24/7 phone support.

Etsy Card Reader App

Free for Etsy sellers, the new Etsy card reader allows sellers to complete transactions offline at trade shows, craft fairs and anywhere on the go. Etsy sellers who sold at physical locations were often worried about overselling since they couldn’t connect to their online storefront. The Etsy card reader connects to each seller’s store front and syncs inventory, so that regardless of how much they sell, they have an accurate data feed of items when they’re selling on the road. If you’re an Etsy seller and plan of setting up a booth at a local craft or holiday fair this season, you need this app.

Ecomdash

To connect your website, marketplaces and physical storefronts, you need a robust inventory management tool. Ecomdash will provide up-to-date data on how much inventory you have at all times, and in which sales channels or brick-and-mortar stores. You can set low-inventory thresholds to alert you when an item gets low on stock. After setting reorder business rules, once an item reaches a certain low-inventory level, we’ll remind you and facilitate communication between you and your supplier. With our new Vend point-of-sale integration, you can now connect your online inventory to what’s in your stores, so that you have a true map of all of your stock. Ecomdash will pull in sales orders from all omni-channel locations automatically, so you will have real-time data and fulfill orders faster. In addition to auto-communication with your dropshipping services, those who run their own warehouses can also print pick lists, packing slips and shipping labels from within ecomdash. Ecomdash is accessible from any device with an internet connection, so you can manage your entire omni-channel system from anywhere while you travel this season. We even had one customer manage his business from the Dominican Republic, and in just 10 minutes a day.

You desrve a break this season. Make sure you have the right apps to help you manage your stores so that you can spend time enjoying your family, the season, and some much needed rest. We wish everyone the best of luck this holiday season and great success! Do you have any apps that you swear by, especially when the going gets tough?

I am at a bit of a crossroads and really need some advice from the community. 

I am in the throws of setting up an online store. I started on Squarespace, mainly due to the drag and drop nature of the software, beautiful templates and the cost. I am quickly finding that it wont work in the way that i want it to due to the ecommerce features being very basic.

* Be able to schedule products
* To have my ""hero"" product as the main page
* Be easy to use for someone with no technical ability

I have been looking around at some other hosted cart solutions such as Shopify, Bigcommerce and 3D cart. They all have their pro's and cons. The big ones being the transaction fee Big-commerce and Shopify charge.

I have just finished a re-design with a Graphic Designer and have the exact look and feel that I want to implement but I really feel like I am banging my head against a wall.

ecommerce,Bought an e-commerce site on Flippa.. starting to get cold feet,"Hey guys,

I recently purchased this site on Flippa based upon the brandability of the domain and the traffic/revenue statistics that were being reported. I think it's a great niche and my initial strategy is to give it a redesign and develop an awesome content section to attract Google rankings.

https://flippa.com/3425805-survival-gear-ecommerce-store-1-700-uniques-mo-making-338-mo

The seller has been mostly responsive in getting everything over to me albeit a bit slow but the more I think about it the more I'm starting to get concerned. I am wondering if it is possible to falsify the numbers that the seller is claiming and if so then I've definitely been screwed. The site does have a few longtail keyterm rankings which I guess i good.

Anyway, I'm wondering if you guys could let me know your thoughts and if there any specific questions I should ask the seller to help determine if I've possibly been scammed. 

I have another 14 days to dispute the sale with Paypal and maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I just know that there are a lot of scams on Flippa. Except for the design, the site seems to have a lot of promise. 

Please let me know your thoughts - thanks!

ecommerce,How important is a logo in the head of your website?,"I've been messing around with my website, trying to get the layout as user friendly as possible, while still keeping the focus on product sales.

Here is the site: [Smoky Mountain Beard Co.](http://www.smokymountainbeards.com)

The biggest thing I'm struggling with is the header.  When I put a logo in there, it seems to compete with the scrolling product banner for focus.  When I just go to plain text with my company name, my eyes immediately go to the banner.

I'm doing all of this on my own for now (bootstrapping).  If things continue to improve, I will eventually hire a firm to take care of all of this.  But for now, your opinions are very valuable to me.

Thanks!",13,0,2014-12-31,ECOM,0.018714165315032005,0.8888095021247864,0.09247633069753647
