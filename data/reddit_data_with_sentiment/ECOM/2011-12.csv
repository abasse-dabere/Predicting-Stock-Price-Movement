ecommerce,Setting up an ecommerce website using an opensource product,"Hi guys,

I'm looking for some advice and possibly some assistance with setting up an ecommerce website for myself.

I'd like to keep costs down and use one of the available opensource applications. I wanted to know which ones have the best potential of offering a really good end user experience and also a secure environment.

Could someone tell me how long it might take for a project to configure the website side of the business, I have a logo and a basic theme and I'm not looking for anything fancy, design wise, I'd be very happy with what is available out of the box for the moment.

It would definitely be very handy to have a filter interface for my products, ie. prices, colours, desingers, etc. I understand this property might only be available via purchasing plugins for some of the applications.

If someone could recommend the best application for my purpose and also where might be the best place to find someone I can hire to help me set it up it would be appreciated.

I'm UK based, specifically in London.

Thank you.",0,1,2011-12-24,ECOM,0.017054729163646698,0.9128401875495911,0.07010503113269806
