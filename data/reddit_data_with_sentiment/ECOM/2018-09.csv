ecommerce,Fashion e-commerce won't sell anymore. What can I do? What is wrong?,"Hey guys, this is actually an e-commerce from my girlfriend, and I'm giving my best to help her.

I'm not sure if we can post our website link here, but it is a fashion e-commerce focusing on gothic and alternative clothes.  We live in Rio, Brazil.

&amp;#x200B;

Our biggest sales comes within the days when new clothes arrives (new collection), which comes in about once every 40-60 days.

Our biggest marketing is instagram (25,7k followers), facebook (12k likes).

We do e-mail marketing on mailchimp, we have a list with around 3k people. Our result here is not really good when e-mailing.

&amp;#x200B;

Website is nicely done in Wix platform and we have 2 payment methods. Product selling price is fine and not abusive.

&amp;#x200B;

We created a really nice culture with our product, our clients like them so much that they take pictures and they tag our store on instagram, which is really nice way of marketing. Our photos on insta get around 200\~500 likes, sometimes above 1k.

&amp;#x200B;

We are doing a giveaway on facebook right now, and we send some products to some famous bloggers that are in our niche so they post on instagram and can boost our sale.

&amp;#x200B;

We yet don't do SEO, nor use salesforce, nor use google analytics. (Our knowledge gotta increase, we gotta study about this, if you guys could recommend topics in this area I'd appreciate)

We do everything better than our competitors, our product is better, our website is better, but still they have more sales and more followers on instagram/facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason our sales are stuck, we are not getting any more sales recently. There are no more than 3 days that we launched a new collection, we just did the giveaway, we did the e-mail marketing, we are constantly posting on facebook/instagram our product.

We don't sell internationally yet, but are in our plans.

&amp;#x200B;

What could be wrong?

Any ideas?

dropship,Dropship Lifestyle - Too Expensive,"So, I took the Dropship Lifestyle 10- day free mini course, however, you only have 24 hours to watch each video. To get unlimited access to all the videos will cost you $47, which in my opinion is a little too much for such a course. Most of it you can find for free on YouTube

Anton Kraly , the founder of [Dropship Lifestyle](https://paytoplayscam.com/dropship-lifestyle-review), seems like a cool guy and has been very successful with dropshipping, still, I wish the main programs were little more affordable.

They have three plans

* ​Basic - $1297
* Premium - $1497
* Ultimate - $4997

The ultimate plan is sort of like a done for you deal plus you get a invite to their annual Bali retreat.

When there are extensive resources and training guides on places like Shopify, Oberlo and Alidropship, I don't understand why these courses are so expensive. Plus, as the course only teaches you paid advertising methods, your expense will be even more.

I also read that the company pulled a fast one on its affiliates after it became well established, apparently it pulled its affiliate program without notice and know you have to be a paying member to promote it. Seems to MLM for my liking.

ecommerce,Looking for recommendation for ecommerce solution that is not Shopify,"I’m looking to launch a webstore for niche cut and sewn tactical gear for military and special forces in the United States.

Recently, Shopify banned all stores that sell guns and ammo. Accessories to weapons are in the grey area and our industry's customer base is starting to boycott Shopify stores because of the sudden banning of these products.

There is a big migration at the moment from Shopify to gun sales friendly ecommerce stores because of this.

All politics aside, I need to make a decision on what solution to choose for our new online store that we do not have to worry about our products getting banned out of the blue and that our customer base will not boycott.

**The key features we need are:**

1. Clean Shopify store theme look 
2. Simple to use and maintain (I’m tech savvy, however there are only so many hours in the day)
3. Not that expensive (Under $20 per month to start out if possible) 
4. 360 Degree Spins for products (using webrotate or similar)
5. Ability to imbed youtube video overviews of our products and installation/setup instructions
6. Facebook Sales Integration
7. Instagram Sales Integration
8. Will not ban gun, ammo and gun accessories sales like Shopify did

**Current options we are looking at:**

Big Commerce

* Pros: Checks all the boxes above
* Cons: Pricey, and the themes do not look as clean as Shopify from what I've seen so far

Word Press with WooCommerce (Hosting on Siteground) plus custom theme

* Pros: Checks the majority of the features we need and more
* Cons: Lot of work to get setup and maintain

ecommerce,Possibly switching to shopify and 1 printify question.,"Hey everyone.  I posted this in /r/shopify also, but wanted to post here as well.

I've been against shopify for awhile, and for no reason to be honest.   A user convinced me to check it out, and now I'm thinking about signing up.  I signed up for the 14 day trial, and I have a few questions.

I currently use wordpress with woocommerce and I like it, however I like the simplicity of shopify more.    With WP, I'm always tinkering with the website because it's never ""perfect"" for me.

Anyway, I sell premade items and custom items.    With shopify, what's the best way to sell custom items?  I want to be able to have a page where they upload their design and tell me all of the info, then I quote them a price, and i would also like to have it where it shows up in the shop page, is that possible?

Someone told me, since right now I'm only making 10 sales per month on average, I should sign up for a development store.  Is that a good idea, or is it against the rules?

I'm wanting to eventually grow and have many more sales, but I've been focusing so much on getting the WP site just the way I want it, that I neglect my actual product and I need to quit doing that.

Anyway, that's my main concern, the custom items.

Now my printify question, on woocommerce I am using printful, but thinking of switching to printify.       I currently have stuff I make at home, and also have items that ship via printful.  With printful, you have to sync everything in your store, then de-select the ones you dont want sent to printful.   How does that work with printify?      I want to have the home made items and items from printify all on one website.

dropship,How to find your target audience and partneship opportunities (influencers) with Audience Insights,"Many people starting out with drop-shipping aren't sure who their target audience and, subsequently, who to target in with their ads.

I will show you how you can use Audience Insights to find targeting ideas ( demographics and interests), how to get inspiration on ad copy and creatives and, lastly, how to find influencers from within Audience Insights.

# What is Audience Insights?

It is a free tool by Facebook that provides marketers with valuable information on two types of audiences: a)people on Facebook and b)people who are connected to your page.  

You can find it [here](https://business.facebook.com/ads/audience-insights).

# How to use it

Click the everyone on Facebook and enter some rough estimates on who your target audience is. Say you have a sports apparel store!  Let's say that your potential audience is men and women aged 20 -45 years. Enter the age range and sportswear as interest, and New York as your target region and next we will go through Demographics, Page Likes, Location and Activity tabs to get ideas who to target and/or partner with.

**Demographics tab**

Here are the notes that you should keep: 

What is the primary subset of your audience? Check out the age group, the gender,relationship status, education level and job title. This gives you a brief idea of your target audience and can be used as a broad targeting option.

**Page likes tab**

Here is what you need to pay attention to: 

Go through the pages that are similar to you. Open them in a new tab and see their follower size, the engagement on their posts and how often they post. This is important as people will visit your Facebook Page. Imagine they find it empty? Why should they buy from? They cannot trust you. By looking at their page it can help you with:

1. Your post schedule for your page
2. Page post ideas in terms of creatives (video, post buttons etc.)
3. Topics to post about. 
4. The tone of voice used in their posts.

Go to the Info and Ads tabs within their Page and see the ads they are running. DO NOT COPY. Use this as an inspiration for the type of ads you could run. See the type of imagery they use. The type of ad copy. The tone they use. The offering.

Use these page names (that are similar to you) as interests in your ad sets. 

You will find that some pages aren't similar to yours. Go through this Pages to find potential influencers or brands to partner with (usually under the brand/celebrity Page category)

**Location tab**

Here you will find the ideal cities and languages to target. You will see that for example that there is a high percentage of, say, spanish speaking people. Consider either running ads in spanish or targeting ONLY those who speak english. Facebook has the [Dynamic Language Optimisation feature](https://newsfeed.org/facebook-enables-marketers-to-reach-international-audiences-with-dynamic-language-optimisation/) that helps you in such cases. 

**Activity tab**

Here you can see how likely is your audience to **like posts and click on ads**. What this means for YOU that you need to craft engaging ads to beat the competition from other Pages.

I hope this helps. 

[Here](https://newsfeed.org/how-to-use-facebooks-audience-insights-to-find-and-understand-your-target-audience/) you can find screenshots and an example of how to use Audience Insights in the fitness niche.

We decided to give Needls a try and spent $1,550. This generated $0 in sales. We didn't realize how poorly the campaign was performing at first because Needls hides sales data in their dashboard. Instead, the dashboard suggested that we had received dozens of ""conversions"". When I spoke to customer support, they were unable to define exactly what these conversions are. We've worked with several other agencies (MuteSix, Social Blue, Shoelace, Adroll) and have a good idea of what to expect in terms of ROI. Generating absolutely $0 in sales on $1550 in ad spend over the course of several weeks is a **BIG RED FLAG**.

​

I posted a while back looking for some help on my Master's dissertation which I am doing on dropshipping. I've tweaked the primary research question a bit since then, I'll be doing my dissertation on Marketing in the Dropshipping Industry. I have now opened the study up to anybody who has a dropshipping store in operation currently.

I'd greatly appreciate anybody helping me out with the short survey. All information given will remain confidential and all names will remain anonymous. I'll leave the link for the survey below but if anybody would prefer to be interviewed via Skype or phone call, that is an option too.

ecommerce,Follow-up: Looking for testers for an Instagram marketing experiment,"Hi again,

I recently posted about a low cost marketing idea I've been developing with a couple of clients. You can read a quick intro here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/9a5ovo/can_i_get_your_feedback_on_a_lowcost_marketing/

Here's the TL;DR: I developed a system that helps brands growth organically on Instagram. When customers buy from your store, we contact them asking them to share a photo of their product with their friends. If they do, we reward them with a small coupon for money off their next purchase. This, along with the hashtags they'll use in their post, creates a genuine image for your brand without you needing to be ""active"" on Instagram.

I've been ""productizing"" the implementation and I'm almost at the point where I'd like to run a beta test with a couple of stores. To avoid repeating my initial post, you can find more info on the product in the original post or here: https://fantap.io (@mods, let me know if you'd like me to delete this link).

The beta is completely free, and I'll work closely with you to ensure any outbound communication being sent is OK (I'm not here to spam your users or ruin your brand). If you're on Shopify that's cool, but if not no worries just leave me a message and we'll figure something out.

-	Clearer app listing pages - now all the key information a merchant needs to select an app can easily be found in the redesigned app listing pages
-	Enhanced search and recommendations - the optimized app store search engine is more intelligent about serving merchants and built for them to see personalized recommendations best suited for their store.

This is pretty much transcribed from my video, so those who prefer to watch instead of reading:  
[https://youtu.be/XAU\_JmgiN3s](https://youtu.be/XAU_JmgiN3s)  
1. Not having enough startup money  
\-it's difficult to start with $20. it can be done, but it's hard. this means you need to spend a lot of time to make up for the money you don't have.  
\-the best solution is to make some money before starting. sell stuff, take on some freelancing work  
2. Selling oversaturated products  
\-stay away from saturated products. examples are dad hats, dog and cat necklaces, keychains, or watches  
\-these are possible to sell with great marketing, but you're just making it harder on yourself.  
3. Following everything that gurus and courses say  
\-there's great content and knowledge out there, but listening to random advice from people with not track record many times doesn't work out  
\-UNDERSTAND what you're doing, rather than blindlessly following tutorials  
\-create success for yourself  
4. underestimating marketing  
\-marketing is the most important part of your dropshipping store  
\-don't use oversaturated influencers, or facebook ad keywords  
\-don't think that if you run one facebook ad, in the first week you'll make $200. it took me a couple of weeks and over 30+ adsets to finally find a winner when I first started.  
5. attitude  
\-attitude is extremely important  
\-know that dropshipping take a lot of time and effort, there's no easy way out  
\-mentally prepare yourself for the grind

shopify,Confused about item price variations,"I will begin by saying Shopify may not be the best platform for what I'm trying to do.  There is no shipping, it's a local business.  It's a soup club for a specified amount of weeks, and there's a few variations that *greatly* affect the price.    


I see that Shopify does not natively support this.  I create a product, and need it to have 4 ""add on items"".  Each item increases the price.  So the only app in the marketplace that I've found that does this is ""Custom Products by HulkApps"".

\- presentation/website

ecommerce,[Shopify] Which Pop-Up Types to use?,"Hey guys!

I’ve yet to implement pop-ups for whatever reason and I’m wrestling on which pop-ups to use.

So i’m wrestling whether to use exit intent pop-ups (followed by email sequence), OR a general welcome subscription (followed by email sequence), OR both?

The software I use allows me to place these pop-ups with an array of condition parameters.

For example the exit intent one can be placed for users exiting on cart page, or exiting in general which also has a condition of which product page they exited from. Meaning the pop-up I send to the user will be specially made for whatever product they were shopping for. So if it was product x, it sends the product x pop-up

The general welcome subscription allows me to have the pop-up go off based on the user’s scroll activity and/or how long they’ve been on the store and furthermore I can also set a condition for which product page they’re on Meaning the pop-up I send to the user will be specially made for whatever product they were shopping for. So if it was product x, it sends the product x pop-up

I feel as though too many pop-ups will just result in rubbishness, but the lack of at least one is hindering my store.",4,4,2018-09-08,ECOM,0.030224887654185295,0.9407864212989807,0.028988659381866455

I installed Wordpress and and WooCommerce along with the default WooCommerce Theme. We were doing well with the default setup.

However, we ran into an issue when it comes to Variable Products and creating Variations. We have three attributes i.e. Color , Size and Fit.

* Color : Black , Blue , Green
* Size : S , M , L
* Fit : Male and Female

So this leads to 18 variations 3 colors x 3 rises x 2 fits

We would like to show 3 different colors but instead of uploading 18 images for each of these variations we would like to do only 3 images for each of those colors. How do I achieve that ?

The issue is not 18 but what would happen if we had 10 colors and 5 sizes :)

I know there is WooCommerce Variation Swatches and Photos plugin but I am unsure if that is the solution because the documentation doesn't outline how to do it at a specific attribute level. Did I miss anything ?

ecommerce,[FB Ads] LAA $5 too low for consistence?,"I have several products with over 400 purchases and I have created 40 (US) LAA's for each of the products based on custom audiences for the 4 main events; view content, a2c, initiate checkout, and purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the  40 $5/day adsets for the 40 LAA's, I generally find about 2-4 that are getting at least a sale every other day with several Initiate checkouts (so those can later be converted through emails). I then find 2-4 more that are inconsistent but overall still maintain a high enough ROAS, low enough CPP, and low enough Cost Per Initiate Checkout (for email conversions) that I keep them up. 

1. Now i'm wondering if this is just me or if this is what is expected with such low budget adsets? My BEP is around $10 so should I move up to $10/day adsets?
2. Furthermore, once I bring those 40 adsets down to 4-8 working adsets, should I duplicate the working ones to $10 budget? I know people say 25% but every guide I see says 25% only for interest targetting and that for LAAs you can kind of double down on your duplicate. 
3. What if the OG adset had ROAS of let's say 3.5x and CPP of let's say $5, then the $10 duplicate has ROAS of 2X and CPP of lets say $9. Should I be manual bidding the duplicate?
4. Finally, with these kinds of adsets, do you guys note that this results in days of shit sales followed by a day of surge sales? Or is this just me?",3,4,2018-09-10,ECOM,0.044593993574380875,0.9245356917381287,0.030870309099555016
ecommerce,Retargeting Like a Boss,"Ever feel like selling to cold traffic is getting harder and harder? Me too, so it's time to up your retargeting of potential customers using the magic of Facebook.

The key is to not be like the herd and retarget every single visitor to your site, that's just wasting a lot of money of people that have just bounced or are just not that into you....I mean your brand.

Here's what I recommend as a starting point, our retargeting is a whole lot more sophisticated but this is a good starting point:

1. Add to cart not purchased 3 days – Optimise for clicks
2. Add to cart not purchased 7 days excluding 3 days – Optimise for clicks.
3. Add to cart not purchased 14 days excluding 7 – Optimise for purchase
4. Add to cart not purchased 21 days excluding 14. – Optimise for purchase.
5. Viewed product 3 days – Optimise for clicks.
6. Viewed products 7 days excluding 3 – Optimise for add to cart.

dropship,Come on!!! You gotta Up Your Game!,"Seriously people!

If you are new to this business you gotta up your game!

90% of the sites shared on here look like they were built by the same person. If you want to do well in this game I will give you the secret.

&amp;#x200B;

ready...

&amp;#x200B;

Create a bloody BRAND around your niche and get behind your business!

&amp;#x200B;

Stop thinking you can build a free trial site and make money. Yes some people get lucky but most of you copy that same shit. You're also seeing people get lucky when big trends come round like new lights for camping or fidget spinners!

&amp;#x200B;

People buy what they WANT not what they NEED.

&amp;#x200B;

However people do buy crap they NEED for cheap and are happy to wait for it.

&amp;#x200B;

People don't buy products. They buy the transformations the product gives them. They buy the benefit. They buy the convenience. They buy the dream. They buy the fun. They buy the feeling they will get using the product. They will buy the time it saves them.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to sell a gold whale necklace because it's shiny is pointless. 

Trying to sell a gold whale necklace that donates profit to a whale charity and has a blog post and videos all about saving whales is way, way easier. And guess what, there's probably a brand behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do this:

1 - Blog every week about your products

2 - Create videos about your products

3 - Prove why people can trust you

4 - Show you are a real business

5 - Get a phone number

6 - Retarget visits

7 - grow an email list

8 - Share valuable content about your products or related to your products

9 - Show the benefits of your products

10 - Educate people about your niche

11 - Start a community

12 - Start a movement

13 - Create a yearly event/competition/giveaway

14 - Create a google &amp; Facebook shopping feed

&amp;#x200B;

That's just the start....

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and one last thing. If you just want to sell 'products"" you're up against sites like gearbest.com and they have way more budget than most of you starting out.

&amp;#x200B;

Spend a week studying EVERYTHING, ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING Gear Best do and you'll already be ahead of most people in this game.

&amp;#x200B;

Does their payment gateway work directly on your store or does another page open up for payment?

The rates seem the most attractive for our location, but they seem to be anti-POD.

ecommerce,When is the best time for a company to begin investing in SEO?,"Let's assume a VC backed company or anyone on the founding team with a background in SEO should begin SEO from day one. They will have enough time to see the SEO results begin to really pay off in a year or less. 

For everyone else they can not spend most of their time and money on SEO because the company will go out of business before a well run SEO campaign really starts to scale. 

We have been recommending that SEO should begin once your projected annual revenue reaches 6 figures. Companies should begin with a focus on Google Ads, Email Marketing, and Social Media. Other important things that can wait include Facebook Ads, Branding, PR, and CRO (we specialize in e-commerce). 

Is this the best advice possible? Should companies start SEO earlier, later? Thanks in advance for any feedback!",7,5,2018-09-12,ECOM,0.01788291148841381,0.9149572253227234,0.06715986877679825

I'm new to this dropshipping game and for the past month I've been playing around in my spare time. I have an idea, a niche-ish market, a brand identity and a solid list of products I'd like to sell. I've been in touch with suppliers and am in the process of sourcing all my products as well as piecing together the Shopify store.

- be in business for at least 6 months
- 3 of those should use aliexpress
- 7 should do dropshipping outside of aliexpress
- optional: have an ebay store
- use woocommerce ( we will support woocommerce, ebay and aliexpress at launch)
- optional (but will help the selection) if you can somehow prove you did not start yesterday and have a 1 product store that sold 0.

ecommerce,Advice needed for my lingerie brand,"Hi everyone,

Im pretty new here, so I hope this is the right place to ask for help. Two years ago I started my own lingerie brand (design and sampling myself) and I think it's been doing pretty ok. At least Im making some money to survive but not a lot. So Im here today to seeking advice about how can I make my business better and bring me more sale. In exchange, I can answer mostly everything that's fashion production related. Or any questions that you would like to ask tbh. I went to school for fashion design, worked for high end and streetwear brands and had experiences working with sample house/production factories in US and China. (p.s. English isnt my first language so my post a bit off lol)

A lil about the brand and my process. All fabrics I use are organic cotton and eco friendly fabric and combine with body jewelry. I design and make my own samples, but my production is in China and I speak the language as well. These are what I did so far:

\- Site link [https://www.theendlingerie.com/](https://www.theendlingerie.com/) I did it through Squarespace, all images are original. My monthly trffice can be from 2k-4k depending on the month. They are mostly direct traffic or from the brand IG. Due to the price of my product, my conversion rate is pretty low, usually around 0.2-0.4 but some months can go up to 0.79 when there's a sale. My site probably needed some improve, would love to hear what you guys think! I know I don't have a typical black n white product shoots but I really love how I present the products.

\-Currently I have 2 stores working with us wholesale (but not crazy amount), 1 consignment, 2 drop shipments (these two stores bring us basically 0 sale). But most of the sales are from my website. I wasn't sure if I should have more wholesale account or focusing on my e-commerce. At the point, I def feeling e-commerce more but would love to add couple wholesale account as well.

\-The only marketing I've being doing is Instagram, I got 28.2K followers and all of the wholesale/consignment/shipments were from IG. The first year, I did a lot of gifting to influencers and it really helped me grow the brand awareness. But I got a bit frustrated this year, since all of the influencers aren't paid, so I got to keep following up and sometime they ghosted out. And it didn't really bring me as much follower as it used to be and I can't never know if it really brings me sale. I also did paid IG ad once a while and did giveaway sometimes. Recently, I've notice my engagement are acting really weird. Some posts can get 100-200 likes and some can get 1k+ likes.

\-I have also tried, Youtubers, Tumblr, Pinterest but not not consistent. I would love to get into more Youtubers but I have hard time finding the right ones that I feel really represent the brand.

\-Started Google Ads few days ago but...its really difficult for me so I think I may giving it up lol, Im not sure if its worth it.

\-Facebook ads, just stared FB Catalog sales, not sure how it will go but we will be. For me FB ads are way more easier.

\-This summer I released the first swimwear collection but it didn't do well. Because our new fabric supplier delayed our production time, as a result, it delayed our collection releasing schedule till June. (most of the brands start market in April). I'm not so sure if I should still go for swimwear next year or focusing on just lingerie. There are still quite few innovatory.

Really appreciate anyone who finish reading this and would love to hear what else I can do more!

shopify,Messenger promo / Automatic response through fb,"So as you can guess first of all I'm trying to do this for little or no money to get my foot in. I've had some success, but I've basically broke even at this point.

Anyway my original intention was to have a 'like &amp; share sale"" to give my page some merit &amp; bring in a little cash flow even though at first it would be pennies on the dollar - 'get things rollin' so to speak. I created an add, I had decent reach, no prospects, but here's the other problem. I would have to go in &amp; individually match people who shared &amp; liked the page then send them the code. Which I was like 'Yeah, it's a bit of work, but okay. It's only good for 220 sales anyway.' but what I hadn't thought through was contact. Just cause I have someones profile doesn't mean I will successfully give them the code. I need it to be automatic &amp; sure. I could setup a mailing list, but that's hard to link to fb - sloppy. 

I saw in a workshop video on somebody else's Shopify page they had an add on I can't find. It's titled ""Reveal discount by subscribing to our messenger list"". What I ideally want is a way to automatically send this discount code either after a potential customer likes &amp; shares which seems impossible, or after they subscribe to our messenger which seems completely doable. I just don't know how. What software do I need?

* Include some form of discount or deal in the adcopy

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I do IG Stories only is because I consider this a form of decently warm retargetting. Not as STEAMING hot as web events let alone specific ones like Initiate checkout but still pretty warm. I have had tons of success retargetting web events with IG stories only (like over 15x+ ROAS even for View Content Event) so I'd think i'd do something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

The ad copy itself is a video of a customer using the product and talking about why they like it. The ad copy uses a gif or two in the ad itself that attracts my niche. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, retargetting video views for me in this style clearly isn't working and I don't even want to try feeds again for retargetting video views (or web events for that matter) so that's out of pocket. Only major difference between this and web events is that web events I generally use a 10-12 second looping boomerang type of ad copy of a customer using the product. This is because web event traffic already know how the product works and why it's a potential purchase for them. While video views don't yet hence why I choose to do a customer video for an ad copy.

dropship,"""Always charge for shipping"" - Right or Wrong? Your opinion...","So I was watching a very insightful video of Gary Vaynerchuck and when he listed products on ebay or amazon he stated *""The seller should always charge for shipping.""* 

Now overall, on Ebay for example, i believe it is 80% of the products on there come with ""free shipping."" Which is appealing for buyers. 

However, I believe only the more established sellers can do this and benefit from it as they either have inventory (stock), local dropshippers or they have a dropshipper/ supplier offering free delivery themselves. In my experience, some dropshippers offer free shipping but sometimes are not very reliable and sometimes take 2-3 weeks for delivery. You have to be very lucky or have a lot experience and good relationship with a dropshipper who can offer free shipping in a timely manner.

There are no shortcuts, people selling the idea that you can find some pot of gold at the end of the new hot product ranbow are full of it.  


Just do it, you can spend all day researching and trying to “learn everything” you’ll never learn what you need to know till you start.   


Who cares what these bozos are selling. What do you want to sell? Where are you gonna get it? What are competitors charging, where you gonna sell Amazon, Shopify, multi channel. Is the product going to have a high refund rate (electronics, clothing), or high reorder rate (supplements, skin care). These are questions you should be asking.   


There is no secret course, here’s the real secret and all you need to know. Just do it.   


Don’t waste your time trying to find some “fad”  
product that you can make money on for a few months then jump to the next product. These guys selling courses on “how to make money on Amazon or Shopify” are so full of it. Don’t waste your time or energy, with these garbage courses.   


You wanna make money in eCommerce pick a product and do it. It’s hard work, it takes brains, balls, and bucks. Anyone who says otherwise is likely trying to sell you some junk course.   


All those big flashy numbers look great, but here’s what your not seeing or thinking about.  


\- inventory management   
\- insurance   
\- sales tax   
\- employees/contractors   
\- refunds/customer service   
\- content  
\- design   
\- reviews   
\- suppliers   
\- supplier lead times   
\- cash flow   
\- inventory cash flow   
\- advertising   
\- customer service   
\- constant R&amp;D new product launches   
\- inventory aging   
\- income taxes   
\- competitors   
\- Merchant problems/Amazon problems  
\- legal/lawyers/regulation   


And on and on...  


You can make a lot of money in eCommerce, we do, but we always have months where we lose a lot of money. I can show you screenshots all day long of huge top line revenue from various platforms we sell on. This means absolutely nothing.   


If your looking to make fast easy money get a job or find some short term hustle that will be over in 6 months.  


If you want to make real money build a business that is sustainable and long term then pick a product, grab your balls, and get ready to work hard and long hours.  


Instead if asking “what product you should sell” ask how your going to sell it.   


The real truth is if you wanna make money in eCommerce get ready to work harder then you ever have, get down in the trenches buckle up.

dropship,"One of the most common issues in eCommerce: traffic, but no sales. Has anyone ever had this problem?","Hey there, /r/dropship

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I would like to thank you all for the great feedback on this thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/9e14en/dropshipping\_is\_good\_creating\_a\_brand\_is\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/9e14en/dropshipping_is_good_creating_a_brand_is_much/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Following this thread, I asked many of you what the most frustrating thing was about running an eCommerce store. **The overwhelming answer I received: having site traffic, but no sales.** Have you ever had this problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this feedback, I went and researched what the most common reason for non-converting traffic is. I found that the biggest challenge (especially for dropshipping stores), is having high quality product descriptions.

&amp;#x200B;

In light of this, I put together a step-by-step product description planning document and video guide to help people turn their descriptions into copy that converts. Google doc and video links below.

&amp;#x200B;

ecommerce,[Advanced FB Ads] How to Make Deadly Retargeting Campaigns and Be Everywhere at Once,"To do this, I’m going to assume you…

1. Have at least 500 sales through your site with pixel installed correctly.
2. Are spending no less than $100/day on Facebook/Instagram Ads
3. Have some sort of cold-traffic campaign that’s predictably bringing people to your site

First, you want to create your retargeting campaign. I like naming it “Hot Traffic - \[GOAL\].” For example, if you’re optimizing for sales, you would call it “Hot Traffic - Sales.” Maybe you’re still building up your pixel so you need to optimize for add-to-carts. Call it “Hot Traffic - Add-to-Cart.” When you start getting massive amount of traffic, naming conventions become super important. You’ll be able to look at data and patterns will scream at you in seconds. This will help you optimize your ads faster down the road, therefore you will scale much much faster.

Next, you want to delete the initial adset and ad that Facebook creates for you. We won’t be needing it.

Create a custom audience of the people who came super close to buying but for some reason just didn’t follow through. Where on your site is this breaking point? I like to think of it as the “leak” in my system and retargeting campaigns plug it. That’s the only logic behind creating custom audiences. I see people try and get super creative when it comes to this part. If you get too creative with your audience, you’re going to blow up your whole campaign. Keep it simple.

Sometimes you’ll have multiple custom audiences. For example, people who have visited your site, and people who have added to cart. At this point, don’t make too many though. You can start really drilling down into retargeting later on. For example, Nike can show only basketball shoe retargeting ads to people who only visited the basketball shoe pages. Save that for when your budget is &gt;$1,000/day.

When your making your custom audiences, split it up by months so you have the same audience but by different time periods. Example: “Visited basketball shoe page (30d)”, “Visited basketball shoe page (60d)”, “Visited basketball shoe page (90d).” This is a great way to test how long you can keep someone on the hook, which will be super valuable down the road. Lots of shops get slowed down and eventually take a nosedive because they didn’t do this.

Create adsets in your hot traffic campaign that serve as a shell for these new custom audiences.

Next, you want to start duplicating your winning ads from your cold traffic campaign into your hot traffic campaign (retargeting campaign). I see so many people try and get fancy with this. Big mistake that will cost you lots of money. If you already have ads that are winning in your cold traffic campaign, why on earth would you ditch them? Don’t fall for this trap that stop 90% of marketers.

A word on budget - don’t get greedy. Keep your emotions in check. Once you get a nice ROI, its easy to hike a budget and bet big. You don’t want to bet big on your first winning adset. Slowly increment it upward. Once you see that the campaign’s engineered properly and can handle a large cash input, you’re good to go.

Once your campaign is ready for big pushes, do it. Don’t be scared. I call this the “Scale Bomb” because you will literally bomb the living hell out of your competitors.

dropship,How we making money by Shopify based on Dropshipping,"**TRUTH NO.1:**  
**Doing with the dropshipping is extremely hard than you imagine.**

Since October 2017, my team and I discovered that,many sellers from Amazon and Aliexpress, in addition to setting up shop on these platforms, more and more of them start to use Shopify to build their own online store.

As we all know, on the case of Shopify,whether selecting products, traffic acquisition or sales conversion is much more difficult than that on Amazon or Aliexpress.

However, with the traffic saturation of the major platforms, not only their rules become more stringent, and the amount of commission also increasing continuously.

When it becomes more and more difficult to find a breakthrough point for our team,I led the team starting the tour of Shopify in March 2018 to see if we can try this out.

E-commerce is a long chain business, probably because we still keep the old e-commerce thinking, so we are very cautious when making any decisions.

The result is that although we’ve been used third-party tool such as Shopify, it still takes us almost one month before the website can be formally launched

What is more?  
We stepped into uncountable traps in the next 4 months.  
Finally, at the end of June, we made our first $100 thousand revenue. 

Which worth mentioning is that after testing our advantage product of Amazon at FaceBook, we found that it’s not a good idea to start from them.  
In able to accomplish this task, we finally become one so-called “ Dropshipper “

As a result by now, looks like we might have found some skills and methods,but when going through this experience, I have to admit there are countless mistakes.

In order to communicate with more online store owners.  
(**ESPECIALLY for some Shopify experts, we really hope to hear opinions from you**)  
I'll try to share some experience in this thread and keep updating, regarding what we exactly did in.

1.Category and Niche Product selection

2.Facebook ADs testing

3.Things we've done to improve our store data.

On one hand, I was hoping to help newcomers to avoid some basic traps  
（**I'm not going to sell any course in this thread**）  
On the other hand, I was expecting to communicate and exchange opinions with the senior experts in this industry, in the meantime find out our deficiencies.

ecommerce,"Am I Employable, If So What Pay Range Do You Think I Should Pursue?","I've never worked 'in ecommerce' but over the years I've worked on many different eCommerce projects some for clients and some of my own. I've built over 100 Shopify stores to date, managed teams of up to 7 (fashion buyers, designers, developers, marketers), have experience developing robust processes and systems as well as marketing (FB, IG, Pin, Adwords). 

I've had some experience in each facet of ecommerce from developing customer service processes to scaling viral Facebook ads up to over $3000 revenue per day, to building out Shopify stores and designing robust sales funnels.

For reasons I'm unwilling to disclose, I'm currently facing serious cashflow issues and I'm exploring the idea of getting 'a proper job'. 

I could continue as I am, but it's difficult to scale any idea when cash is tight. It seriously affects your cognitive bandwidth and is very difficult to spend uncertain money when it is your last. 

What role would you recommend applying for? 

Here's a summary of my 5 year experience:

* Shopify store design, setup and branding. Over 100 created.
* Project management. Managed teams of up to 7. Developed efficient processes so team members can work autonomously. 
* Adwords: Scaled a project profitably from $0 to $700 per day in 2 days. 
* FB Ads: Scaled a project profitably to $3,500+ a day within a month. I generated $1,000 per day for my last client. 
* Funnel Optimization: Abandonment emails, remarketing, display, DPA, product page design. 
* Development: Basic HTML &amp; CSS. 
* Sales: Closed around $40,000 of project work last year. This included designing a process oriented pipeline with scheduled follow ups. 
* Sheets &amp; Modelling: Very good at creating projections in a marketing context and calculating various key metrics. 
* Profit maximization: Helped a client go from $3,000 per day to $4,500 by pushing upsells, cross sells and restructuring pricing. 
* Business knowledge: Solid grasp of almost all basic to intermediate business concepts from management consulting frameworks, to marketing theory and accounting processes. 

I do not have an Undergraduate degree as I dropped out to pursue ecommerce. I got started with $100 worth of jewelry. My logic is that I would learn more valuable skills being in business, as opposed to studying it. I still believe this is the best choice as I would be 1 year into an entry level position with limited real world skills and experience. 

So how much am I worth? And what should I apply for if at all?

ecommerce,Creating An eCommerce Funnel To Get A Job?,"So I've had an idea which I think is quite novel. I'm an eCommerce entrepreneur and consultant seeking to transition to a salaried position.

The idea is to create a digital CV / Landing page which is setup like a product page and then create an ad funnel driving CEO's, marketing directors and recruiters to it. It's going to be quite humorous with things like 'only one left' and a shipping and returns policy. The add to cart button will lead to a typeform where the interested party can give contact information, the role and information on their company.

For generating traffic I will use a combination of advertising techniques, I'll use a few video ads for cold audiences and then remarket with carousel ads on FB and display as you would with any 'normal' product.

I'm thinking that this approach would prove a lot of skills, such as landing page design, lateral thinking, a range of advertising techniques, funnel design and optimization etc.

ecommerce,A local e-commerce marketplace,"Hey /r/ecommerce,

Together with two partners I'm in the midst of launching a local e-commerce marketplace.
We are bringing together local shops (grocery store to bookstore to fashion boutique) to present them on one centralised platform.
Only people from our city will be able to place orders and we will deliver the goods ourself the same day and at no extra cost to the consumer (stores will pay a small fee). The goal of this is to strengthen the position of brick and mortar stores against e-commerce giants like Amazon.
Everything is in place, from the shops to the cars and delivery drivers. But now our e-commerce partner who promised to build our platform has informed us that he will not be able to fulfill our order.
Now we want to take this into our own hands (and only contract out specific things like SEO etc.) and so my question is: Which e-commerce platform would be best suited for our endeavour? I've been playing around with Shopify (and the multi vendor marketplace app) and so far it seems good enough and there seem to be apps to cover most of our needs. But maybe there is a perfect solution out there and I just haven't found it yet?

The to 3 things we need from the platform:
Multi vendor interface: Orders have to be redirected to the specific stores so they can be prepared for pickup.

Vendor visibility: We want to present the stores as an integral part of our platform and so they need to be presentable in a good way. Vendor profiles and the ability to place the corresponding vendors logo under each product are important.

Good data import structure: We will be handling quite a big inventory (the bookstore alone has 900,000 available products). The ability to interface with inventory control systems, not just CSV files would be great.

TL;DR: Want to sell stuff from local stores to local people via ecommerce because people are too lazy to walk to the store. What do?",7,5,2018-09-23,ECOM,0.019541168585419655,0.9247093200683594,0.05574951693415642

Dan is an absolute champion, a no holds barred type of Aussie larrikin that takes no shit. If you're a ""Guru"" with no real results he's got you in his sites.

Dan and I met a long time ago circa 2011 after we both had our initial start online. I had just started Bambino Brands and he was running a Facebook page called NoExcuseFitness. We connected and have obviously kept in contact ever since embarking on a very similar career path while never actually having worked together.

I hope you find inspiration for your own online endeavors!

So without getting wishy-washy about how much I respect him let's get stuck into it.

# Shopify Success Story: Dan Nikas and $5,000,000+ in Year 1

1. **Your Name:** Dan Nikas
2. **Company:** GearBunch
3. **Monthly revenue (average):** $350k USD
4. **Number of founders:** 2
5. **Number of employees (excluding founders):** 9
6. **Location:** Australia
7. **Start date:** December 2016

## Where are you based? Do you have a family? What do you do for work and fun?

I’m currently based in a small coastal town called Yamba in New South Wales, Australia. I cut my teeth in e-commerce selling custom t-shirts on Teespring. It was during this time I teamed up with my business partner Luuk, who is an awesome designer.

My motivation to do what I do is my family, I’m married with 3 young kids, and every decision I make is based on improving their lives.

To take my mind off business I love watching Rugby League, chilling with my mates, hanging with my family and exercising.

In terms of work I look after the marketing and managing the team that controls the backend of our store and customer support. Luuk looks after the design side of both our store and products.

## What did you do before getting started online?

Prior to getting involved in e-commerce I had a successful career as a Police Officer in Australia. I joined the Police when I was only 19 years old and over 17 years I climb the ranks to eventually become a Detective Sergeant in the Homicide Unit.

Unfortunately, the job took its toll on me resulting in my being medically retired at the age of 36 *\[Damn, that must make you like 50 now? \~ Ronnie\]*. Fortunately, in my spare time, I had been doing a bit of online marketing and found that I had a real knack for it.

My primary goal as a Detective was to find people who didn’t want to be found, further to that I had an ability to get people to do what I wanted them to do whilst have them believe that it was their idea. Turns out both of those skills translate really well to marketing, the added bonus is people were no longer trying to hide from me, they leave trails everywhere for me to find them.

## What do you sell in your store? Who’s your target audience? How long have you been selling online?

We currently sell leggings, sports bras, shoes, hoodies, and swimwear. Prior to GearBunch, Luuk and I were doing pretty well selling t-shirts, but we weren’t the only ones. The market was quickly becoming saturated and we were finding it more difficult to stand out. So we started to look into other apparel.

We knew the market and knew we could sell pretty much any clothing item. But we wanted to find the right product to stop hitting the same problem we had with the t-shirts.

We looked into big sellers of apparel and noticed a growing trend for active gear. What we realized is these major players all only offered general items. What I mean is they designed the items to fit their brand. It means you just end up with, like Adidas/Nike/Under Armor’s summer/winter/fall/spring collection.

It creates a boring selection, and it’s actually pretty backward when you think about. So we flipped it on its head. We instead decided to put the customer first. Rather than trying to fit products to the brand, we created customer avatars and created specific items to appeal to that demographic.

By turning things on their head and putting the customer first, we saw our stock literally fly off the shelves. In our first month of operation, we were achieving $100,000 in revenue. After just one year, we hit nearly $5,000,000 in total sales.

## How often do you launch new products?

We launch approximately 10 new designs per week when we launch a new design. We also make it available across all of our product lines.

Our design team is constantly looking at current trends around the world to determine if we can create a design that could complement the trend piggyback on it.

We also lis...

ecommerce,Is the dropshipping model saturated ?,"Hi everybody,

I'm new to this section but as a student currently, I was wondering about joining the dropshipping ""game""; but it looks like it is some kind of saturated, sometimes. 
Would you have other possibilities than a Shopify store to suggest ? (Please not a course that costs 600$).
Maybe Amazon ? But isn't it difficult to play against so many resellers ? 

Thanks in advance !",9,6,2018-09-24,ECOM,0.039071228355169296,0.8996080756187439,0.06132064759731293
ecommerce,Ecom Category Management with Multiple Sales Channels,"This is going to be a pretty broad and subjective question and I understand it can be different for every business. But, any insight would be appreciated.

I'm trying to introduce Category Management into our Ecom operations here. I know it's necessary because we carry thousands of SKUs across multiple categories. One person can't be an expert in all of them and therefore, unable to balance the average margin we need from each. 

The hangup I'm having is with how it would work with multiple sales channels. We have our branded channel and we also sell on all major marketplaces. So, do you have a few category sales managers with access to multiple channels or do you have category sales managers for each specific channel? If you go with the former, youd also need someone to still ""own"" the marketplace itself, the relationship, the policies, seller metrics, etc.

Hope someone can help! Thanks.",4,5,2018-09-24,ECOM,0.02413487806916237,0.9190125465393066,0.056852567940950394

shopify,Turning Tag pages into sub collections - SEO,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an SEO and newly working with a Shopify site (not sure how I've avoided Shopify in my 6-7 years until now!). 

&amp;#x200B;

The site has about 10 collection pages and some 'Tagged pages' which site 'underneath' these collections. 

&amp;#x200B;

As tag pages are just filtered versions of the collection, they inherit everything from the collection page, including H1, any page content/descriptions etc. This is obviously an issue as having say 5 tagged collection pages means essentially having 6 x the same page. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is justification for creating the tag pages as collections (or like sub collections) themselves for this site as: 

1. Can justify this on search volumes
2. There would be so few pages with only the current collections on the site (if tag pages were removed)

My question: 

Am I best to canonicalise the tag pages to their original collection pages (assuming this is not already done), or, what I would like to do which is create the tag pages as collections themselves. The issues with the latter are that (as I understand), you cannot redirect a tag page, and I cannot seem to get rid of the tag page anyway. As I understand, I would need to remove all reference to the 'tag' from all products currently using it. This isn't very helpful if I want to create the new collection pages based on the tags the products are using. So, for example lets say I have the pages [www.example.com/collections/shirts](https://www.example.com/collections/shirts) and the tag page [www.example.com/collections/shirts/mens](https://www.example.com/collections/shirts/mens) and I want to create the tag page as [www.example.com/collections/mens-shirts](https://www.example.com/collections/mens-shirts) (or however the structure would be), I would want to redirect [www.example.com/collections/shirts/mens](https://www.example.com/collections/shirts/mens) to [www.example.com/collections/mens-shirts](https://www.example.com/collections/mens-shirts) which I cannot do, and to create the page [www.example.com/collections/mens-shirts](https://www.example.com/collections/mens-shirts) I won't be able to use the tag filter 'mens shirts' to tell Shopify which products to show because I will have deleted it.

&amp;#x200B;

As a test I have created a collection page out of a tag page, now both are indexed in Google which is clearly no good. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best thing for me to do to enable this site to rank for the tag terms without creating a complete mess? :) 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any bright ideas (and can understand my rambling) or experience with this, let me know!

Just to give a bit of context, a couple months ago, I started an online business selling herbal vaporizers and other herbal accessories within Canada (meaning we only ship within Canada and plan to only accept Canadian Dollars). After weeks of advertising, I made my first sale earlier this week (yay!). However, I also got an email from Stripe (the ecommerce payment processor) saying that they will have to turn my business away because of the “high risk” nature of my business. 

So now, I have to find another payment processor for my business. I was wondering if anyone here had a similar experience or could refer me to some trusted payment processors.

Here are some constraints:
1. Willing to process payments for a vaporizer retailer
2. Process my payments in Canadian dollars (to avoid the cost of currency conversion)
3. Easily integrated with a Shopify ecommerce website.

I will be selling products like shirts, phone cases, tote bags, mugs, etc. I'm wondering, should I put my logo on my designs? If I were to, it would be small and fairly inconspicuous. I can see the pros and cons of both sides. Adding my logo is good for branding and putting my company name out there.

ecommerce,"What is the best way to charge accurate shipping prices? Analyzing 120,000 orders.","We've had our site up and running for about 10 years now with about 120,000 orders since launch. Shipping charges have always been a sore spot with us. We ship alot of heavy, fragile, and awkward sized items. The ecommerce platform we use is Volusion and we ship everything via Fedex. We enter the approximate weight of the item in our backend and additional handling charges based on the item. What the customer pays in shipping is usually pretty close to our actual shipping costs. But what happens far too often for my liking is a major discrepancy in what fedex charges and what we collected from the customer. Usually where we don't charge enough in shipping, but also sometimes benefiting us where we charge too much.

My goal would be to charge shipping rates as accurately as possible to our customers. We have a ton of data from Fedex after shipping 120k orders. I know going through every item we sell and getting accurate measurements and weights would be a good start. However we have over 15,000 items and doing that would just not be possible currently with our lack of time and staff available to do so. Is there any kind of  SaaS, AI software, companies that specialize this this... to analyze our orders shipped (items shipped, quantity, cost). After analysis it would revise shipping costs within our backend.

Right now we offer free shipping over $75 on the whole website, however if we do that and someone orders $70 worth of meat and $10 worth of honey, we will lose money on the honey order since it ships separately.

ecommerce,How do you choose which sales channels to market to? (PPC),"Hi folks. 

I’ve been pondering this for a while and wanted to see what r/e-commerce thoughts were. 

I have a small (full time) online business sell on a number of popular sales channels, Amazon and the like. We have a reasonable social presence and spend around $2000/mo on online marketing via FB, Google etc. My question is what would best practice be when it comes to directing that paid traffic to a sales channel? I currently alternate between sales channels, directing most ads to our website one month for example and then directing to Amazon the next for example. I figure that’s not optimal.

I know from one perspective, my website should be the primary place as I can capture not only converting customer data but also retarget and get email subs. The other perspective is Amazon and other sales channels give ranking boosts to higher traffic (and converting) listings, meaning more visibility to other shoppers on that platform- so it also makes sense to direct traffic to them.

I know I can’t be the only person in a similar position so I’m curious to what you do or would do.

Let me know if you need more information to give an educated response, and thanks in advance!",2,4,2018-09-30,ECOM,0.01450883038341999,0.9151958227157593,0.0702952966094017
ecommerce,"Need Something, umm, Delivered?","Can I check my ear for pitch? I mean sales pitch. I received an email offer today in my Gmail *promotions* inbox for Google Express. I believe the offer can be read two ways (but I'm not sure). 

1. If you are not involved in Internet trade, that is, just an avid buyer, the offer looks like a promotion for an aggregated sales platforms search. 

2. Or, is it also a pitch to drop shippers -without overplaying their hand? Can Google Express be used for that purpose?

My store is a niche product. I make it myself. I offer free shipping, cc payment (but no PayPal), and my ""market plan"" involves direct mail. No pressure. Long game. I don't like hucksterism -and it will never be my style. 

So, I might not get the possible drop shipping potential of Google Express.

A fact which may be pertinent is I received the email promotion within 24 hours of obtaining a Google *Analytics* registration. I don't expect to need it, but it's another cool feature of my store.

I would expect Google to notice a detail like an Analytics registration. Does Google's Analytics department think I am setting-up a drop shipping Business?",3,4,2018-09-30,ECOM,0.02360510639846325,0.9364970922470093,0.03989776596426964

woocommerce,Using WooCommerce Subscription for custom sized deals.,"Hi there,

Going to try and make this straight to point.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on a project that uses WooCommerce + WooCommerce Subscriptions to handle online payments to clients. Basically generating emails, invoices and payment pages and the orders will be created manually via the Admin dashboard instead of providing a front-end store to the clients.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we have two models of selling:

1) Fixed subscription products that cost X per month and have a initial fee of Y. First invoice. X+Y have to be paid and from then onwards X will be charged every month - all clear here as it matches the purpose of WooCommerce Subscriptions

2) Custom deals where our Sales Rep make different sales per client and normally close the deals on a agreed total price for a specific time (usually 6 months).  This deals can have 3 or 4 products and the product price is negotiated with the client so it's not a fixed price (it might include discounts).

&amp;#x200B;

It's this second situation where I need some brains to help me out on a workaround as we want to provide a recurring payment for this. e.g. A deal closed of 1200 $ will be paid over 6 months. 200$ every month. Technically this is instalments payment mode but WooCommerce Subscription offers Automatic recurring payments and we want to use that in our advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

In my head,  I plan to create Simple Subscriptions products and when creating the Subscription in the admin panel, we will change the price of each product accordingly, to match the agreed price per month and make the subscription end after 6 months. If there is any kind of discount, it has to be calculated before hand or adding a negative fee to match the price. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would this be a good practice or is there a simpler way to do it?",0,2,2018-09-30,ECOM,0.03358909860253334,0.9357149600982666,0.030695917084813118
