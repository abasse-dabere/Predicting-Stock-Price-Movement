ecommerce,What style of product pages have the highest conversion?,"This was originally a Quora question we found that we wanted to answer further.

The product pages that have the highest conversion (in our opinion) are those that do one thing well: engage your visitor. 

Here's how you can further engage:

**Use great product images**

The more visually appealing and detailed your product images are, the more trust you will build with visitors, and the higher your conversion rates are going to be.

[Gear Coop] (http://www.gearcoop.com/) does a good job of showing multiple product images, and the rollover zoom allows the customer to see the detail as if it were right in front of them.

**Answer All Your Users’ Questions**

Pages that perform the best can answer all the questions a visitor might have about your product. If they’re looking at a shirt, make sure you have a user-friendly sizing guide that’s unique to the product.

Check out how Backcountry [displays] (http://www.backcountry.com/burton-sidekick-reflex-snowboard-binding-womens?skid=BUR00ZQ-SMO-S&amp;ti=UExQIFJ1bGUgQmFzZWQ6V29tZW4ncyBTbm93Ym9hcmQgOjE6Mjo=) their sizing guide for this pair of snowboard bindings: comprehensive and unique to the product. Additionally,  you can sell more on your product pages by suggesting similar or complementary items that the user may also be interested in.

Both The Clymb (would link to their product page but you have to create a membership to view products) and Backcountry do a great job of presenting their potential customers with more products they may want to buy.

**Add videos**

People who watch a video of your product are as much as [85% more likely] (http://blog.crazyegg.com/2015/03/05/videos-boost-conversion-rates/) to make a purchase. It can be expensive to create a product video, so if you are on a tight budget be sure to carefully select which products you want to make a video for.

JetBoil does a great job of featuring a video on [their product page] (http://www.jetboil.com/Products/Zip-Cooking-System-Carbon/), as the product itself necessitates a visual. For example, their video for the Jetboil Zip Cooking System shows a comprehensive detail of each component of the system, what accessories it's compatible with, and leaves the viewer with all their potential questions answered.

**Social Justification**

Social justification like product reviews act as ‘social proof’ of your product’s credibility. When customers can see what other buyers think, they’re more confident in making a purchase. 

Another form of social justification you can implement is user generated content (UGC). This could be Instagram photos, tweets, videos, and more.

You can feature images of your product that your customers have taken and posted on Instagram like Oiselle does on their website. [See how] (http://www.oiselle.com/shop/running-bottoms/running-shorts-and-skirts/distance-shorts) they encourage customers to “share their #flystyle”? Showing your product in real life adds “social proof”, shows how you product looks on different people, and is easy to include on your site.

**Ready for Mobile**
Your mobile site should offer a completely *different* experience than your desktop site. 

Addressing things like hierarchy of information are crucial to conversion rate optimization. Since you’re dealing with limited real estate on mobile, it’s very important the user sees the most important information immediately. BassPro has a separate mobile site and their product pages do a good job of prioritizing the info. Most important in their design: photos. Then, they have other information that visitors highly value: description and reviews.

Really consider mobile as a separate channel, and your process in optimizing product pages for mobile will become much more clear and focused.

Those are a few ways to become more engaging on your product pages and (hopefully) get your conversion rate moving in the right direction.

ecommerce,How do you evaluate new product opportunities?,"I have developed a tool for quickly evaluating new product opportunities and am looking for some feedback on what other functionality might be beneficial to add.  What I have so far is the ability to upload a spreadsheet of products that you are considering including product cost and we then go out to Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Shopping.com, etc. and return the pricing for the products in the list.  With this, we return the results in the tool and via email with a calculated margin based on the products uploaded.  The idea being that if you submit thousands of products, you can quickly evaluate the most profitable opportunities and know whether there are a lot of people selling the products or not.  It sort of has a dual purpose in that you can evaluate new product opportunities and also track competitive pricing on the products you already have.  
&amp;nbsp;

So, what other things do you do for your e-commerce store to evaluate new products?  # of reviews for a product?  CPC costs for keywords related to the product?  
&amp;nbsp;

A few details:  

* We have a list of about 10 websites so far that we are evaluating against and will continue to add more as time goes on.  

* When you upload the products, we allow for additional costs such as drop ship fees, shipping, etc. to get a true gross margin calculation.  

* After uploading, the tool returns results in less than an hour.  

* Of course, if you are interested in trying it out, send me a PM and I'll set you up.",2,2,2016-04-01,ECOM,0.024680200964212418,0.9269023537635803,0.04841741546988487

Due to the volume of other areas I need to focus time and money on, I'm leaning towards Shopify for my store front. I know all about their short comings, but came up with what I hope is a strategy to mitigate them. Will this work? 

1) Build my store on the Shopify platform (takes me no time at all as I've done them before)

2) Build all my content and Blog on Wordpress. I'm already paying for a modest hosting package so I can just slap a blog up fairly quickly. I have no issues getting the blog up in a few days, it's a full store that would be just too much right now. 

3) On the blogging site put a ""shop"" buttom that links off to my Shopify site

4) When I have the time/money/experience/validation of my product finished, I can migrate the store portion of the business over to the Wordpress site with something like woocommerce. I'm assuming it's a fairly simple 303 redirect at that point if I'm smart about my architecture at the start. It's possible I never close the Shopify store if the results are good, but I'd think long term I'd eventually want everything on a custom WP site or custom HTML.

ecommerce,Have you ever bought things from a foreign website?,"Hi Everyone,

I am a graduate student in Taiwan, I am currently doing a research about cross-border online shopping.I want to figure out what possible factors that may attract people to go cross-border online shopping, therefore, I made a questionnaire to let everyone who meets the qualifications to do it. I prepare a lucky drawing(10 quotas of $15 Amazon gift card) to encourage people for doing this survey. Hope you can help me to know more about this issue, and to complete my thesis. :)

The qualifications for participating in the survey are listed as follows:
1. You are an individual buyer (not a buyer for an organization) who has shopped on a foreign website or considered making a purchase via a foreign website at least once in the past 12 months.
2. The product to be purchased requires physical delivery across national borders. Digital goods and services that can be delivered via the Internet are excluded.

You may provide your email address for a drawing. If your survey responses are complete and valid, you may be one of ten lucky respondents to win a $15 Amazon Gift Card. The winners will be informed via email.
The email address will not be used for personal identification purposes.

This is the online questionnaire's link, if you are interested, just click to start!! :)

ecommerce,Question about efficient integration/setup of ECOMM Platform + Payment Processor + Accounting Software for automatic bookkeeping...,"Hi guys - new reader in this sub, lots of useful info here, thanks for all your hard work and opinions! I confess I am VERY new to the entire ecomm and retail world, so forgive my naiveté... 

We are still in the early phases of launching our online store and want to set up everything to be maximally efficient/automatic with with respect to the flow of orders placed into bookkeeping on accounting software. We are starting completely from scratch, so not tied to any legacy set up. It will be an online-only store...

I currently plan to use Xero for accounting (seems optimized for mobile/cloud, cleanest design and best support for multi-currency). So now I am researching btwn Stripe and Paypal for payment processor. My partner is handling the web-design and I believe is debating btwn Shopify and Squarespace. (EDIT: So maybe I've answered my own question already: I'm digging into Shopify's offering now and see they have a full payments gateway offering which is powered by [Stripe](https://www.shopify.com.au/payments) and can add a [PayPal gateway](https://www.shopify.com.au/payment-gateways/australia))

Everything I read about the integration plug-ins for either Stripe or Paypal into Xero seem kind of horrid, and it's a process that I would think should be quite straight forward, so am I missing something? 

[Stripe Integration Reviews](https://community.xero.com/business/discussion/2211421/)

[PayPal Integration Reviews](https://community.xero.com/business/discussion/2213052/)

There seem to be 3rd party solutions to ease this set up, listed [here](https://stripe.com/docs/integrations) - but isn't this adding an extra middleman (and monthly fee) unnecessarily? Am I overcomplicating and should just use the POS services built-in to Shopify or Square? I think I'm on the cusp of a lightbulb moment just need a little guidance..

TL;DR: Looking for wisdom about the triangle relationship btwn Webstore, payment processor and accounting software.

Thank you all in advance and best of luck with your businesses.",6,3,2016-04-06,ECOM,0.0396307073533535,0.924534022808075,0.03583521395921707

I'm in search of a plugin that will allow us to perform an **ACTUAL** one-click checkout after a customer has completed a purchase.

Do I make the product variable, then have the framing as an attribute? Problem is I will have different framing costs and each will require a different image. (What I mean is each product will have a different picture when framed - there is only one framed image per product).

shopify,Under attack: Seeking Fraud App with rules specified here,"Hi there  
We are currently under attack. Our store is chained to our warehouse with instructions to immediately fulfill every order as it comes in, so I need something that will cancel orders for me. I have notified the warehouse to hold orders to all countries excluding first world until we sort this out.    
We've been using Shopify's Fraud Filter app, but its filter options can be beat with multiple cards and a proxy. Here are the rules that our fraudsters consistently fail:  
""The credit card was issued in X, but the billing address country is Y.""  
""The customer's credit card used for this order has been associated with fraudulent transactions.""  
""Unable to process a payment for $XX.00 USD on the Visa ending in 1234."" repeated attempts on multiple cards  
I'd like to try some AND boolean on all combinations of 2 of these and see if that helps.  
What are you using and what works? Will any of these apps allow us to write the above rules?

ecommerce,Need a good recommendation for VPS hosting with WooCommerce,"Disclosure:  This post will contain several noob questions/statements that may or may not make you laugh.  With that being said, I am ready to create my website for an e-commerce business.  I have chosen WooCommerce as the platform to build my website, and I am in desperate need of a good recommendation for hosting.  I have done ample research, but since I am new to e-commerce, I am struggling to find the best hosting company.  I do not want shared hosting.  I want VPS hosting with decent support, great loading speeds, and good integration with WooCommerce and other Wordpress plugins.   I don't mind paying up for good hosting, but I don't want to overpay for something I don't need.  If I get lucky, and one of my ads draws in a lot of traffic, I do not want my website to falter so reliability and uptime is the most important factor.

I have read so many forums and webpages advocating for this service vs that service, and it's hard to distinguish the paid vs unpaid recommendations.  I was looking at Dreamhost, but I read somewhere that you can't build your Wordpress website through their service so it was not recommended for someone new to Wordpress.  When I was in college, I could code full websites in HTML, but I've forgotten most of what I knew back then so working with Wordpress or any form of web development is a new concept to me.                                             



I also looked at Siteground, and their ""go geek"" plan that runs $30 a month.  I was heavily considering that option until I read on several forums that their customer service was absolute garbage.  I've read that GoDaddy sucks, BlueHost is not that great, and HostGator leaves much to be desired.  I've also read several articles online that recommend companies I've never heard of.     



Can anyone recommend a good, reliable, hosting company that works well with WooCommerce and the majority of Wordpress plugins, plus has decent support if I run into issues along the way?  I would really appreciate any help or input.",9,2,2016-04-13,ECOM,0.04726710170507431,0.9230501651763916,0.029682686552405357

I have searched online and read of the official Woo plugin to turn your online shop into a catalogue. This is one solution.
I could disable the site entirely, placing a temporary landing page explaining we're away and will be back in action soon.

ecommerce,HELP TEAR MY BUSINESS APART!!,"Hi guys!

Firstly I'd like to apologize in advance for not having anything valuable to share. In fact I'm here because of that lack of knowledge.

I'm here today for some feedback and thoughts about my small e-commerce business. A bit about myself, i'm a 22 yo currently enlisted in the army and just doing this because i enjoy it. I've spent most if not all my free time working on this (it's about a week old)  Its become my reason for getting up every morning and staying up late every night. It's on my mind constantly, the first thing i think about and the last when i sleep because it combines art, photography, writing, fashion and business; all of which I love and am interested in, and doing this allows me to blend that all together :) I will finish my army term in August and after that, it's university for me.

I'm largely here to take any insight/advice/criticism. (I've already approached the business, startup and entrepreneur subreddits)

My site: [Ryanyoung!](https://www.ryanyoungempire.com)

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Young-1026148980764453/)

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ryanyoungempire/)

On to my site.

I'm just 1 guy behind this. All the photos and designs are mine and i use Printful along with Shopify. (if anyone has any questions regarding both platforms i'll be more than happy to answer them as best i can).

Between the 2 I don't actually take away much profit (about $1-$3 per sale). I knew this before I took the plunge and I'm fine with it really. It was an itch I've been long meaning to scratch but excuses just kept coming up. Between army and university, I don't think I'll have very much time to do everything myself. And I can't hire anyone when there's no business yet to work at :/

I guess my questions are:

1) I understand marketing will be a HUGE part of this. I'm reading up as much as i can about it along with fb ads, instagram etc if anyone has any tips/advice about this i'd be forever grateful. ELI5 how and what little/not so little things I can do to improve my site.

2) No one knows that i'm doing this, not friends nor family (i guess i wanted to be sure i could succeed before telling anyone i'm doing this. If i do fail, then no one needs to know and i'd have learnt something from this adventure). I'm turning to strangers on the internet because I won't have to deal with niceties and false compliments, though in good nature, hinder me from actually fixing/learning and improving on anything.",10,5,2016-04-18,ECOM,0.03596288338303566,0.9274038672447205,0.036633316427469254

ecommerce,Critique/troubleshoot welcome.,"Hello, and thanks in advance! 

First a bit about us.

 We are small business that has been selling online for nearly 8 years. We are primarily an ebay business but we have a real brick and mortar storefront. Most of our products are surplus industrial parts from businesses. We are also dealers for a line of new OEM electric motors, mixers and air presses, ect. Up until last year we grossed about 300k on average however last year sales were drastically reduced and this year appears as though it will be even worse. We haven't altered our way of doing business except for getting equipment for better photos, more information in listings, wider product offerings, selling on new platforms. However, as I mentioned sales have all but dried up.

Second what we've tried.

When we first noticed a decline we started running some small 10% promotions which seemed to help for a short while but that eventually quit working. Just last week we ran some 40% sales and unfortunately didn't notice the slightest change in sales.

I thought to check prices and went through almost all of our 2k listings to check if we were indeed still competitive and we are.

We ran a google adwords campaign but I feel that any increase in sales that may have resulted were offset by the cost of the campaign though I cannot be certain since ebay doesn't allow you to use google analytics to check even the most basic of web traffic.

I made sure our listings were as available as possible. Ebay lists our products on google shopping. Our business is on facebook, twitter, google.

Last

Ebay has an analytics tool through terapeak that shows impressions to clicks and as of the 17th we had 0 impressions through search down from 18k the previous day. We are a 100% positive feedback seller with top rated status so I can't think we are being hidden in searches.

The sales have dipped everywhere we sell, however, and I can't help but feel like we're missing something. I think the elections, current scrap and fuel prices play a role in our industry but we're at a loss. It feels as though we have become invisible.

ecommerce,Tips for managing you facebook page?,"I figured you guys would be the best to ask for this one, 

A huge proportion of my conversions come from Facebook ads since my target audience seem to be the folks that think the internet starts and ends with FB.  

As my facebook business page has continued to grow it has become more and more difficult to keep on top of comments across all my ads and posts simply because the facebook comment system is a mess.  

Trying to sift through 100's of comments that are in **no particular order** just to find the few new ones is starting to take up way too much time.   

I figure my options are, in order of preference.

* You guys tell me about some setting I have missed that displays facebook comments in chronological order.
* I spend a weekend fumbling my way through building a tool to display comments properly.

woocommerce,Coupon Code for free product add-on?,"Does anyone know if it's possible to create a coupon code to give the customer an add-on for free? For example, a product costs $100 and embroidery costs $6.50, I want to give them a coupon code for the free embroidery.

This gets complicated as I have different prices for each currency, so I couldn't simply create a $6.50 coupon code (and even if I did, there isn't a way that I can find to only allow the coupon code if a product has the embroidery add-on).

ecommerce,Absolutely in over my head.,"So I applied for a customer service position at a local business with a heavy focus on keeping up with their customer questions and issues across multiple ecommerce outlets (amazon, ebay, bigcommerce, etsy and what not.) 

After quitting my old call center job and diving head first. This position morphed into a nightmare of search engine optimization, dealing with different rules for the different ecommerce platforms, and just plain cleaning up a really big mess made by people who didn't know any better. The couple that own the business are older and after seeing numbers their business has been exploding the past few years and it's all thanks to Amazon.   

I don't want to leave, the pay is great for where I live. It's just I've been an underachiever my entire life and turning the ecommerce of this little mom and pops business into a well oiled machine will do wonders for me and my families future.

I'd appreciate any pointers, good faith, resources for study, good forums or subreddits for any potentially stupid questions I may have anything. There's simply so much information and so many things I need to do that I don't even know where to begin.

ecommerce,Suggestions for determining free shipping minimum,"An international company I work with would like to include an amount for shipping/customs/logistics within their selling prices, and offer free shipping on larger orders. 

Our inventory is just about 100 items, ranging up to $600 without any shipping added, and up to 40kgs/88 lbs. The customers would have the option to ship air freight (more expensive, charged by weight) or sea freight (cheaper, charged by cubic meter). For the most part, once an order comes in, we will have to request a shipping quote for the delivery and with high shipping costs, it looks shocking to a customer with a heavy orders quoted with air freight. Also, if we offer free shipping on everything even with an amount added into the price, there will always be a small but heavy order that results a bigger loss due to shipping costs than we are willing to eat.

Are there any good ways to come up with a minimum order amount or weight or anything that isn't a complete guess for a free shipping minimum? Or is a calculated shipping cost on every single order just a better way to go? Currently the sticker shock of seeing the costs is causing some customers to decrease or cancel their orders.",10,3,2016-04-21,ECOM,0.09286056458950043,0.8783862590789795,0.028753196820616722

ecommerce,Need help with international shipping!,"I recently moved to the United States from Canada and am about to launch my online business in a week! I'm still in the midst of trying to figure out what to do about international shipping. The american to canadian conversion rate is already so high that adding a crazy shipping rate on top of it will chase away customers. 

Here's a little info on my business: I'm basically selling modest clothes for people of different faiths that want to dress modestly but fashionably. There are limited options that aren't flat out ugly, so I want to be able to reach as many people as I can when it comes to sending stuff out. I use USPS flat rate shipping for the US but the rates I've looked into sending stuff to Canada are like $30+! I can't exactly do that because the most expensive product I sell is 65 dollars. &amp; with the conversion, my Canadian customers will be paying over 100 CAD for one dress (which essentially conflicts with my whole modest pricing thing). 

Since I spent most of my life in Canada, 90% of my supporters (from social media) and email subscribers are from there. So I think I'll need to provide some sort of affordable shipping solution sooner rather than later. 

Any advice on that? Thanks in advance.",4,5,2016-04-23,ECOM,0.02235664241015911,0.925781786441803,0.05186158046126366

ecommerce,"Overnight(ish) success, how should I handle it?","Hey guys, I've been lurking around the last few weeks and decided to go ahead and create a throwaway account as a good portion of our business comes from reddit.

We've been lucky enough to be a bit of an overnight success... In the last 9 weeks we've moved over 1000 units of our product with sales growing each week from our big cartel store.  I've had a ton of great customers and lucked into a (~50% profit margin) product I can manufacture in house. 

Here's the problem... I'm pulling my hair out barely keeping up. We moved ~200 units in 24 hours last weekend alone and the ship robot queue keeps growing.  We'd like to expand into FBA but I'm afraid of not being able to keep up with our big cartel sales. To make matters worse, I work 50 hours a week in a job that I can't just quit without significant financial distress.

Where do I go from here?  I'd love to be able to devote myself to this full time by years end.  Do you guys have any tips for a lucky newb that jumped headfirst into the deep end?

Thanks!

ecommerce,Wix vs. other platforms for very small stores,"I currently work for a company that I love, but I'm limited in the number of hours I can work for physical/health reasons. In order to supplement my income, I was considering opening a very small webstore, possibly with a partner. My starting funds are rather small; $250-300 by myself, more with a partner but not much. I did a lot of research into Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, and a little less looking into StoreEnvy and related sites.


My question is, since my store is starting out very small, would it be good to start off with Wix? I'm decent with design and the templates they offer are nice, plus the price point of their services is excellent for me. $20-30 a month is almost nothing compared to the $80 I'd be paying for the others per month and if the store ends up flopping, it'd be less money lost.


Also, if you've got first hand experience with Wix services, I'd love to hear your opinion of them.
