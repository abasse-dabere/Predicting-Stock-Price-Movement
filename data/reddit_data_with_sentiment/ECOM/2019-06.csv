I have compiled everything I did below in hopes to find some answers, and if it helps another beginner then even better!

**Store**

To start my Shopify store is [modernmuscleshop.com](https://modernmuscleshop.com). I also have an Instagram page @ModernMuscle.Official with 12k followers and fairly high engagement (30-50%). I haven’t used in a month due to being on vacation, but before I left I gaining 700-900 followers per week organically with no promotions.

**Product**

Air Freshener: [https://modernmuscleshop.com/collections/interior/products/car-air-freshener](https://modernmuscleshop.com/collections/interior/products/car-air-freshener) The reason I chose this item was due to its stats on AliExpress’ dropshipping center that said it was and still is selling between 300 to 500 units per day.

Just some Facebook ads (which are cheap - like $5 a month!!), and you’re off!

My questions are this:
1. Why haven’t I made any sales? All my products are the same as my competition and I copied and pasted their descriptions and ads. Why aren’t I getting their sales???
2. Can someone here build my store for me??? Write my copy?? I just want to make money and honestly this is starting to feel like a real job and stuff and I just want money lol

I would be so grateful for someone to open up my mind and clear my path for other ways around.

ecommerce,Brand Name and Search Competition?,"I've come up with a reaaaaaaally good name for an online T shirt store I'm starting up, but there are 2 problems with it: it's been bought by HugeDomains and being offered for $2,000, and it's also a trademarked name that is shared by a big video game extended name (ex. Uncharted 2: ***Among Thieves***). My niche has nothing to do with the video game, and I called the US Trademark people to make sure it would be okay. But a few thousand people search for this phrase every month, I assume for the game, and there are 50 million Google search results for it. So I'm concerned that maybe the competition on Google's search algorithms wouldn't be worth the good name?

I've come up with a backup name, which is good-ish but not quite as good. Instead of being powerful like the first name, it's more like it would make people nod and say ""yeah, sure. I get it."" It's for $10/year and has only 7 million Google search results, no trademark.

A plan that I was thinking of is that I could sell on sites like Redbubble, Etsy, Teespring, etc. (or even the backup domain) until I have enough in sales that I can buy the powerful domain (I'd be okay with reranking) and to have market validation before dropping $2k on a name.

Original post link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/bwdn3g/reached_a_milestone_my_slackshopify_side_project/

----
**Full post text below**

I've always been inspired by reading the stories of other entrepreneurs on here who are trying to build profitable side projects so I wanted to share my own personal milestone!

I just got my third paying customer for my Shopify+Slack app, which is called [Shoppy: A Better Slack Bot](https://apps.shopify.com/shoppy-a-better-shopify-slack-app-by-emerald-io). Shoppy connects with Shopify stores and sends order notifications and order summaries to Slack. The reason I built it is because other Slack+Shopify apps out there didn't include tracking, tags, and discount information in their alerts, which meant I was spending way more time on reporting versus actually growing the Shopify store I managed.

So I made Shoppy, launched it on /r/shopify, and it went...badly!

Once I had a real user, I discovered a bunch of bugs that I couldn't have figured out if I didn't get a real customer. I emailed that customer, and he thankfully worked with me over 3 days and a bunch of emails. Eventually, we got it working for him, and from there, I started getting more free users.

My first paid customer happened about 2 months after that, but they never really reached out. It was the 2nd paying customer that really took Shoppy to the next level.

They were a massively successful health brand, and they needed the automatic daily, weekly, and monthly order summaries to work. Unfortunately, they had broken, and I didn't really know why the broke. But, this brand upgraded to paid and said they would be happy to pay if I could fix it. I told them I was on my honeymoon, but I would be back in a few days and I would get right on it.

Once I came back, I started gchatting with my point of contact at the brand, and we worked together on getting the notifications to actually send automatically and I added in-Slack slash commands for her (like **/shoppy help**).

They ended up being my third five-star review, and from there, I was able to get my third paying customer about a week after.

**So since launching in late December 2018, I'm now at 3 paying customers, $45 in gross monthly recurring revenue, and about $15 in profit per month!**

It's not a ton of money, but I'm noticing the time between paying customers is getting shorter and shorter and retention is going up!

I hope this story inspires you to keep building because if I can go from no programming experience to a slightly profitable side project I know you can too!",28,58,2019-06-04,ECOM,0.11872635036706924,0.8468948006629944,0.03437889739871025

Any advice? I only have enough money to do one website, otherwise I would do both to compare directly. I've read that the best conversion categories are beauty and tools/home improvement and the worst includes electronics. The smart equipment fits into both tools/home improvement and electronics, while the beauty product (obviously) fits into just beauty.

Thanks in advance for the advice!

Edit: more factors I forgot to include- the smart equipment is made in America and for US shipments would only be 7 days in contrast to the beauty product, made in China, which would ship in 20-35",13,8,2019-06-04,ECOM,0.04930463433265686,0.9120367169380188,0.03865864500403404
ecommerce,Spotting freight pickup scams?,"Background: I run an ecommerce store with lots of LTL freight shipments. I don't ship internationally, due to the huge time suck.

I have gotten many badly worded ESL emails over the years from people posing as customers and wanting to pick up a pallet order with their own freight forwarder. 

I don't know exactly how the scam works, but I assume some guy posing as a carrier will show up and take the shipment, and then the customer will claim his real carrier never picked up and do a chargeback on me. So I have avoided all of them.

Today a Canadian logistics company wants to send a carrier to pick up and bring an order to Canada. Native English, legit looking email and website.

So far I'm going to request a wire payment instead of credit card, and ask what freight carrier they're using.

Here's what we've been up to in the 40 days (as of June 4th) since launch:

* 💬 Conversations with 100+ Shopify store owners from 10+ nationalities (Google Translate FTW!)
* 🏆 #1 ranked app for [WhatsApp](https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=whatsapp) keyword
* 🛍️ 2000+ active Shopify stores
* ❤️ Highest-rated “WhatsApp Chat” app on Shopify with [raving 5-star reviews](https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button/reviews)
* 💻 2 major iterations launched (v3 introduced a paid plan)
* 🌟 Featured on the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/)

How did we do it? I'm glad you asked!

## Why we built a micro-SaaS

In my previous post, I explained ""[What is micro-SaaS?](https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/build-website-using-gatsby-netlify)"". In this post, I'll explain why I picked micro-SaaS.

I've been enamoured with the startup world and coming up with ideas to startup ever since I joined the industry, back in 2015. I've dreamed and imagined and fantasized about building billion $ startups so much, I was consumed by it.

It's a cultural thing - you work for startups, you live in the startup capital of India, you read startup blogs and you discuss ideas with your friends in social gatherings. So of course your mentality becomes one that is constantly seeking and evaluating potential ""[unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance))"" startup ideas.

I never paused to consider that the entire world around me is building small, local, profitable businesses around me.

If you walked down the street near your house this morning, chances are you crossed about half a dozen different ""businesses"" that are operating and thriving (if they weren't, they would shut down, as they do not have millions of $ in funding to burn cash). I started to appreciate the beauty of a [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business).

A startup that is successful often has many things going, including and not limited to

* validation of core value proposition
* working channel(s) of acquisition
* providing continuous value or retention
* great product and customer service

Guess what, a local business has a clear and well-validated core value proposition, they have a channel of acquisition (street walk-ins, or Google SEO), and they are already providing continuous value else customers would stop coming and the business would shut.

As I became increasingly frustrated with the ""how do I come up with a [Zero to One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one)idea"", my mentality shifted from the obsession with ""unicorns"" to

* is this problem real and validated?
* is there an acquisition channel we can tap?
* would users come back?
* can we build a great product and provide excellent customer service?
* can we grow a business to $100k/yr in revenues?

I also accepted that not everyone, and not all the time, does one have to aspire to build a unicorn. I can just build a business. And having never actually run a business before in my life, micro-SaaS seemed like the perfect launchpad into the world of business.

Sankalp and I spent months discussing these questions before we both bought into this concept, and believed in it, and therefore decided to work together towards it.

## Why Shopify and the e-commerce market

**Short answer?**

My friend [Shashank](https://twitter.com/shashankkr9) runs a thriving and highly-profitable Shopify app called [PushOwl](https://pushowl.com/). His journey, his learnings, his success taught me and inspired me and made me believe in Shopify as a platform. He also helped me realise just how [HUGE the e-commerce market](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics) is (have you heard of Amazon?).

📷

**Long answer?**

Back in 2017, I tried my hand at building an online store. [Dropshipping](https://www.shopify.in/guides/dropshipping/understanding-dropshipping) was the 🔥 back then, and I wanted in.

I did manage to build a store that raked in \~$500/mo in revenue, but after multiple copyright violations (that's what happens when you source generic products from Aliexpress) and a lack of general understanding of how an e-commerce business is built, I shut it down.

Aftwards, I took the time to understand what makes a valuable e-commerce business. I could understand and relate to people who started out of their homes, packaging their own products and selling to a niche audience, making a livelihood out of their business.

I truly wanted to enable and support these people, especially considering that I'm trying to do the same thing.

In the previous section, I highlighted how ""is there an acquisition channel we can tap?"" is an important question. Turns out, Shopify's app marketplace is a potential answer.

I also asked ""can we grow a business to $100k/yr in revenues?"". Thanks to the humongous size of the e-commerce market (in trillion $), the answer was YES.

**But why Shopify, and not Atlassian or Slack or Google Chrome Extensions?**

* we were familiar with Shopify
* we knew about e-commerce due to my past experience
* we knew people in our network succeeding with Shopify

All these tiny reasons and more made Shopify the most obvious choice for us.

## Uncovering opportunities on Shopify

In the first section, I highlighted the questions that need to be answered in order to have a shot at building a successful business. Let's apply them to Shopify.

Browsing the [app store](https://apps.shopify.com/) was a perfect way for us to understand what problems e-commerce store owners face, and care about. Shopify breaks things down by category and sub-category, giving you a very granular idea about the different types of problems you could solve.

📷

Additionally, you could type in keywords on the Search bar, and that would give you more ideas about what problems to solve. I used Shopify's search autocomplete as a heuristic for sufficient demand.

After all, why would Shopify's search team include a keyword in autocomplete if it didn't have enough demand?

📷

Before narrowing down, we did a very general approach by researching the entire app store. I personally visited every single page on the Shopify app store, under every category and sub-category, which helped me in creating a mental map of the ecosystem.

It also gave me ideas on how to evaluate any particular idea.

**Is there enough demand?**

* is the problem being solved a ""keyword"" in Shopify's search autocomplete?
* are the existing apps for that keyword getting new reviews? Since new reviews are a signal that new users are searching, installing, using, and liking the app enough to write a review.

**Who are the competitors? Can I beat them?**

* what is the average rating and #reviews that my competitor has?
* how strong is their recent reviews? is it all 5-stars? if so, is there a way for me to beat them?

**What are the competitor's strenghts and weaknesses?**

* what keywords do people use in positive reviews? what keywords show up in negative reviews?
* are there enough negatives that give a newcomer an opportunity to make a better product and acquire users?

📷

*(screenshots from my research spreadsheet...ssshh)*

📷

**What is the business model of competitors?**

* are they charging a very high amount (say &gt;$50/mo)? if so, is it because of costs, or can I build the same product and price it 5x cheaper at $10/mo?
* is the app free/freemium? if so, are they using this app to drive business to another? can I compete with a different business model?
* what features are my competitors charging for? can I make those features available for free and find a way to monetise with something else?

**What is the tech effort involved?**

* can we build an MVP in 2 weeks? can we build out the entire product and feature set in 2 months?

**What keywords, categories, and sub-categories do they rank for?**

* how do I acquire new users? Is there a keyword where they rank #1? If yes, can I beat them? If not, can I rank #1 for a different keyword in the same domain?

**Market outside Shopify**

* can I launch the same app for other e-commerce platforms like [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/), [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) etc. in the future and expand my market size?

## Solving tech challenges while building a Shopify app

If this is your first time building a Shopify app, I highly recommend that you start from their excellent [documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started).

During development, you are sure to get stuck at many places. If you are unable to resolve something on your own, your first response should be to check the documentation.

It's not very likely that you would find answers on Stack Overflow, hence I recommend joining a Facebook group full of helpful [Shopify App Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/shopifyappdevelopers/).

This group was recommended to me by Shashank, and it helped immensely as the other developers are friendly and helpful. And now I'm paying it forward by recommending it to you.

## Ranking on the Shopify app store

Shashank helped us understand the lifeblood of any Shopify app - ratings &amp; reviews.

How to get them? The answer is no hidden secret.

1. build a beautiful and easy-to-use product
2. provide 11/10 customer service
3. optimize store listing for right keywords
4. win!!??

From Day 1, we were obsessed with serving every user with the best possible customer service. In the process, Sankalp and I ended up chatting with 100s of Shopify store owners from countries like Brazil, India, Mexico, Colombia, Spain, United Kingdom, South Africa, Morocco, Chile, China, United States, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, Denmark, Pakistan, Netherlands, Costa Rica, and more.

Sometimes, we spent hours talking to customers about their business and trying our best to help, even when it wasn't related to our app! This is a perfect example of ""[do things that don't scale](https://dothingsthatdontscale.com/)"", as our customers were overwhelmed with how far we were willing to go to help them.

As a result, we have 100+ reviews on the app store, and are rated 5-stars.

📷

From Day 1, we also ensured that our app was simple, and easy-to-use. We paid extra attention to the first-time setup, making it a breeze. All the fields that a user needs to configure would be pre-configured out of the box. Only the phone number field needs to be populated, and our user is good to go!

In the store description, we made sure to include keywords such as ""whatsapp live chat"" and ""customer support"" in an organic manner.

We were also very clear on the search terms we wanted to rank for, and our store listing reflected that.

📷

## Monetising our Shopify app

In order to acquire users, we launched v1 of WhatsApp Chat Button for free. Our aim was to provide a bare minimum feature set that every other app was providing, but give it away for free in order to attract users.

This set a simple flywheel in motion:

more users &gt; more conversations &gt; more reviews &amp; ratings &gt; higher search ranking &gt; more users

In v2, we added the most common feature requests which included basic customisations to the button design, display position, etc.

In v3, our focus was to provide premium features that users had been asking for during conversations. We also wanted to ensure that a paid plan didn't affect any of the existing users, so we decided to keep the base feature set free forever.

📷

By keeping the free plan, we essentially want to ensure that our acquisition channel remains strong and that users prefer us over alternatives.

v3 with our first paid plan was launched on June 3rd, 2019. Since the plan comes with a 7-day trial, we are still awaiting results on trial-to-conversion % at the time of publishing this post.

## What's next

Our immediate plan is to launch v4 and v5 in the month of June.

To collect information about what features to build in an automated manner, we designed a simple Google form and added a link in our dashboard saying ""Vote for the next feature"".

Here are the results:

📷

The goals behind of launching v4 and v5 are

* provide more value to our user base
* to make our product more resistant to competition
* charge a higher monthly subscription amount

This is how we will do it:

**1. Abandoned Cart**

E-commerce shops already send [abandoned cart](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/shopping-cart-abandonment/) notifications using push, email, SMS. But what about doing this over WhatsApp?

Since this cannot be completely automated (API limitations), we are focused on building a solution which allows a store owner to send \~100 abandoned cart messages per hour manually on WhatsApp.

Our feature will remove all the manual work except one - actually hitting the send button from inside WhatsApp.

In our survey, we found store owners more than willing to spare 30 mins/day to send abandoned cart notifications. Why wouldn't they, when it could lead to &gt;$1000 in additional revenue every month?

**2. CRM**

Store owners want to stay in touch with their customers. After all, it is more [valuable to retain customers](https://www.shopify.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies) than spend more to acquire new ones.

This could involve sending lifecycle messages, follow-ups after a product is delivered to ask for feedback or review, or informing customers about new launches that may interest them.

We want to build an easy way to enable this behaviour over WhatsApp.

**3. Pixel Retargeting**

What if you could retarget people who were interested in a product, but didn't see through to a purchase? [Retargeting ads for e-commerce](https://shoelace.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ecommerce-marketers-guide-to-advanced-retargeting.pdf) is no new concept.

It's proven to work and there are several great companies such as [Shoelace](https://shoelace.com/) that are built on top of this concept.

The key is to understand context: who to retarget? what to retarget them with?

**4. Better designs for WhatsApp Share**

Currently, we offer 10+ premium chat button designs to our paid users. We plan to make them available for the Share feature, so that a store owner can have matching buttons.

📷

We also plan to add new templates like a sticky button, and a pop-up message. The aim here is to help shop owners initiate more conversations with their store visitors.

## That's all folks!

I hope readers of this post find value, especially if you're planning to build your own Shopify app.

If you have more questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Just drop me a message!

ecommerce,How on earth do you drive traffic to a brand new ecommerce store?,"I see a lot of stuff about email marketing, lookalike audiences, conversion optimization and retargeting being the best way to acquire business for existing stores but I’m struggling to find a ton of information on what the best way to gain traffic for a brand new store starting out. As far as marketing costs can afford to go ~300$/mo in the red a month but would hope that wouldn’t be for long.

Because of my store concept, i’ve put myself into a tight spot to find traffic in the infancy stages of the business.

I know t-shirt businesses justifiably get a  bad rap but try to trust me when I say it’s going to be quality apparel, a nice website, and a unique take.

**SEO** will be tough because it’s apparel and the niche is pretty untapped online, so no one’s really searching for it. **FB+Insta ads** are tough; I hear it’s hard to find a profit margin on AOV orders value of under $50 which would most likely be the case. **Social Media** is a long term plan and it’s going to be tough to find enough quality content to post before there are people posting on instagram wearing my apparel. **Affiliate Marketing** - Plenty of relevant blogs so I suppose I can just ask but not sure if they’d want to associate with an unproven brand. **Micro-Influencer** -  I hear this is pretty hit or miss but might be my best bet.

shopify,"Sleep Easy, Schedule Your Themes Without Shopify Plus","Hey everyone! I've been managing Shopify stores for the last couple of years and one thing that always kept me up at night was running promotions and scheduling content. There are plenty of apps out there that let you schedule banners and promotions but none that I found that allowed you to simply schedule a theme to publish. There is Launchpad, but that's only available with Shopify Plus. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I created [Theme Scheduler Pro](https://apps.shopify.com/theme-scheduler-pro?ref=reddit). It's an easy to use Shopify App that allows you to set a date and time for a new theme to go live. This works really well for running promotions. No more staying up late waiting for your promotion to end! You can duplicate your current theme, make some changes and schedule a time for it to go live with Theme Scheduler Pro. Rest easy knowing your theme will publish at the time you choose.

shopify,Followup: Dealing with cart abandonment,"Last week I [asked around for some feedback regarding things we try to do to take care of cart abandonment](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/bwaju4/how_do_you_deal_with_cart_abandonment/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;amp;utm_term=control_1)

I’ve been exploring some bigger than usual changes for one of our brands after having grabbed most of the low hanging fruit, meaning having marketing automation infrastructure, paid funnels, email in place and a good followup structure. The brand is profitable but would grow several times faster with a lower abandonment rate. In spite of that, I started developing an allergy to the idea of accepting a 60%+ abandonment rate. 

So I started exploring some fundamentally different approaches that might turn the results on their head. Talking with some of you and several merchants like me, I came across something pretty interesting which as a product guy, I’ve decided to go ahead and build. 

While peeling back why cart abandonment was high, one of the questions I asked myself was whether I was alienating users because of pricing, and whether some form of dynamic pricing might help reduce abandonment. If I could figure out what someone was willing to commit to pay before they added to cart, and I could acquire a lot of those offers, I could realistically start moving more product and drop my cart abandonment. 

But then it struck me. This isn’t about price at all! Being able to move inventory at will is the actual crux of the issue and it’s a merchant issue. It’s as I expected: the way we sell is creating a natural ceiling for our cart conversion. To enable a totally different result, we’d have to use a totally different approach, one that takes into account the fact that shoppers have become privy to discounts and they are using their shopping carts (basically) like a wishlist

So here’s what I’m thinking. 

The goal is to enable merchants to clear out inventory profitably and at will. That would inherently give them the superpower of being able to move more product, and by extension drop the abandonment rate. 

My thinking:

* the shopping experience is evolving

* shoppers are saving the items they like in their cart and are holding out for a price that works for them

* they have become privy to common ecommerce patterns and common push activities aren't helping

* ""industry average 60% abandonment rate"" is whack, and it's due to the way people are using their cart

* i’m going to enable shoppers to tell merchants what they'd be willing to pay for items that sit in their cart for extended periods of time and then authorize a prepayment in case it is accepted

* merchants will be able to analyze incoming offers and their margins, pick and choose the inventory they wish to move and even activate several cohorts all at once

* this create large amounts of profitable unfulfilled orders at will and gives retailers a brand new way to serve their clients while having the ability to move product faster profitably while reducing cart abandonment rate. 

I’ve started to prepare some specifications for this, and I intend to get it built, but I’d love to know if anyone else would want to use this in their store (in which case I’ll release it publicly)",12,6,2019-06-08,ECOM,0.04866817966103554,0.9222255349159241,0.029106218367815018

dropship,Continue running FB ad sets past 24 hours if no conversions?,"If I have 10 x $5.00 (purchase objective) ad sets running (for a pet product that I'm selling for $18.00 with free shipping), is there any reason to continue running any of the ad sets that didn't  get even a single ATC in the first 24 hours?

dropship,Debunking AliExpress Myths + Underrated Feature,"I've been following this sub for well over 2 years, giving my advice where I can but I feel like this needs to be laid out in a single post. This is for beginners who are hesitant to get into dropshipping and those who have been burned and start spewing loads of BS as to why their experience with dropshipping was less than mediocre. 

**Myth: ""Dropshipping is Dead. Everyone sells the same crap on AliExpress and it's oversaturated"".**

**Truth:** Yes, a lot of dropshippers do sell products from AliExpress and if it's a popular product, there are probably at least 100+ shops selling that exact same product. Does that mean you can't get your piece of the pie? Absolutely not. The problem here with people that feel this way is that they don't understand the concept of added value &amp; branding. As a customer, if you place an ad in front of me with a cool product but I land on your site and it's slapped together with basic AliExpress descriptions, low quality images, no reviews, minimal to no branding, why in the world would I buy from you? 

**Solution:** BRAND BRAND BRAND. Shopify recently released the State of E-commerce and the #1 thing driving sales and returning customers was brand loyalty. You do NOT have to go to the extent of having items private labelled with your logo, but within the niche that you're working in, without a solid brand you're destined to fail. As an example, I'll give away one of my current sites that's doing about $10k/month in sales: www.savetheturtles.ca 

I took a trendy product/niche (reusable products) and created a brand and a mission. There was a problem (single-use plastics in our oceans), there was a solution (reusable straws), and there was a mission (donate a portion of sales towards saving the turtles). None of my products have my brand on it, but customers don't care. The site makes them feel connected to the brand and want to back the mission with their money. 

Not good at creating brands? That's fine. You go the route of a single-product store and look like the expert/originator of that product. Example: Moon Lamps (I do not suggest you try selling this product in 2019). Instead of slapping it inside your general store, make a completely separate site BUT you need the domain to match an originator ""feel"" such as www.moonlamps.com. While it might be rare to find these domain names, if you keep an eye on trends or new products, you're guaranteed to find a suitable domain and BAM you now look like the originator, making you more trustworthy than www.johnsdeals.com. 

The other aspect to branding, is the sales pitch. As mentioned above basic AliExpress descriptions just don't cut it. SELL ME THE PRODUCT. You are a SALESPERSON! Tell me all the reasons I should buy this product, all the problems it solves. Show me GIFS of the product in action. Layer that with some review photos from Ali but text from Amazon and you've got credible social proof. I want to know that the product I'm buying has been purchased before and that people gave it two thumbs up. 

**Myth: ""AliExpress is garbage. No one is going to wait 25-30 days for a package to arrive""**

**Truth:** China to USA does NOT take 25-30 days if you find a supplier who ships same day, packages will arrive within 7-14 days and if it takes longer than that it's a customs issue. International orders however do sometimes take that long, but most international customers understand that it will be a longer wait. Also with the advent of Amazon, it's understandable that people can become annoyed by the lengthy wait times for parcels from China. Many people look to finding local suppliers but that usually involves cold-calling, contracts, and a less than automated shop in terms of ordering, tracking syncs etc. 

**Solution:** Rather than attempting to spend countless hours/days finding local suppliers, one of the most underrated features on AliExpress is the ""Ship From"" search option (see screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/15LWCzB). I don't think I've seen one person mention that AliExpress ships from the USA! While the product selection is less than if you were to ship everything from China, suppliers are catching on that there's a demand for items shipped from the USA. Most trendy products now have an option to be shipped from the USA. Say goodbye to long shipping times (4-7 business days now) and hello to return customers because they were satisfied with how promptly they received their products. Keep in mind that orders shipping from the USA can only be shipped to the USA, but I assume the average person who starts dropshipping understands that the USA is the largest purchasing audience. 

BUT, not all products need to arrive fast. If I'm unable to find a product that ships from the USA, as long as I follow my method of branding and the product is an absolute necessity to those purchasing or just so damn cool they need to have it, they have no problem waiting (my personal experience). I do get a handful of customers asking when their product will arrive or how long shipping will take, but you avoid frustration by providing customer service above and beyond anything the big boys can offer.  

While I am sure there are more myths to debunk, those are the two most common questions/critiques I see of dropshipping in this sub. Hopefully debunking those myths and offering up some solutions motivates the beginners in here to bunker down and rethink their approach or if you haven't already, dive in and get started!",41,155,2019-06-09,ECOM,0.04134503938257694,0.9231138527393341,0.03554106131196022

dropship,10 Ways to Make Your Products and Services Stand Out in a Saturated Market,"How does a business make its products stand out in the crowded market? Answering this query represents the holy grail of marketing. Each and every day, thought leaders and marketers invent new messaging ideas and repurpose content of all types. If your messages fall under this category, your aim is to lift them above the category and get them to stand out in the marketplace. Here are ten ways to move closer to the marketing holy grail.

￼

Focus on Helping People, not making the Sale

People will buy your products when they know you care about them. Whether you are selling in person, writing a sales letter, or doing a sales video, your audience is silently watching to see whether you care more about selling your products more than helping them find a product or service that will best serve their own needs. Don’t be pushy. Focus on the customer to the extent that you almost cease to exist. 

Guarantee their Satisfaction

Offer a strong satisfaction guarantee. If the customer doesn’t get the expected results from the product, make it clear that you know you don’t deserve to be paid. This strategy makes people more comfortable buying from you and also costs nothing.

Offer a Marketing Hook

Offer information as an incentive for additional contact. The “hooks” should provide something of value to interested prospects. Here are some good examples of hooks: 

• Give us a call today for a free ebook
• Download our free mortgage calculator

These hooks increase the attention your website gets and your response rate as well.

Be Human

Don’t fall into the pit of forgetting that customers are human beings. Most businesses forget this and fail to make an impact in the market. In the face of big data and social media automation, these factors often seem to disappear. Focus on authenticity, trust, and passion so as to make your audience find it reasonable to interact with you. On social media, post photos and videos of your team members being themselves and converse with your followers and ask and answer questions, instead of using it strictly as a promotional tool.

Talk to Real People

We sometimes forget to talk to real people. The truth is that every day, were are using various tools such as BI dashboards to evaluate the current status of metrics and key performance indicators for our business and know how to connect with your customers. While it is appropriate to do this, don’t forget to get involved in real conversations with real people for more insight.

Show Yourself

When showing yourself, remember to demonstrate how your products are different from those of your competitors. Develop an authentic voice that cuts through commonly used business jargons. Also, use simple tools like Wisestamp to create your own signature.

Read More

Reading more will increase your intelligence, creativity, empathy, and brain power. With these, you are more likely to succeed in the world of business.

Build on Your Strengths

Find what is already working for you and built on it. Measure what is working for you using conversions, not vanity metrics. Use tools such as Optimizely to help you make changes on your websites so that you can tell what to do to serve your clients better.

Position Your Business as Experts

Your prospects will not contact you merely because you are experts. Demonstrate the expertise to them, and only after doing this right will they have a reason to do business with you. Treat them with respect and deliver on all your promises in a timely manner. 

Take Action

If you have been marketing your products for a few years, you must have heard these nine marketing ideas? How have you used them to grow your sales? For many marketers, these are not new ideas, but they have not put them into action yet. Take action to see results.

ecommerce,"Posted this in an Ecom FB group and got a lot of people saying it was helpful, thought I'd share it here as well","Something that I've noticed when people come to me asking for an audit or consultation is that 9/10 times Ecommerce owners have the exact same issue in regards to their ads and why they aren't converting well.

So although I'd love to take more money for this advice, it just doesn't feel right because it's literally the same thing over and over again.

I'm a marketing person, I'm not a guru, I'm not some millionaire entrepreneur, I may run an agency but we're pretty modest. Believe me I am well aware of the ridiculous over saturation of the marketing industry with people who don't know what they're talking about.

Okay let's begin.

This won't apply to everybody obviously, each store is different, you may have a different issue but to many of you this is going to change your business.

Facebook Ads are great, I love social media advertising, BUT IT IS NOT MARKETING IT IS A MARKETING TOOL.

The entire platform is a tool to deliver a message or content in which there are different ways to do so. Facebook Ads are a tool to deliver CONTENT. A lot of you may be sitting there now feeling anxious because you're thinking ""does that mean I need to buy a camera? record a video? edit? Make something creative? And the answer is YES! You need to create something captivating, something entertaining, something interesting, be CREATIVE!

I'm so serious, 9/10 times I go into a consulting session or audit, I see that a company is using some half assed ad content of stock imagery or even a video and when it doesn't work well, THEY CHANGE THE AUDIENCE TARGETING! Heres some advice, DONT CHANGE THE TARGETING CHANGE THE CONTENT!

The content is what makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE. Sure the targeting is important also, but if you create the right content, it will reach that audience eventually anyway because of the engagement.

I could go way more in depth with this, but this post is already super long and I have to go do exactly that\^.

Hope this helps folks!",29,50,2019-06-11,ECOM,0.025288956239819527,0.9297974109649658,0.0449136458337307
shopify,"If you’re not retargeting, you’re losing money","One of hopefully the first things you’ll learn about Facebook ads is that it’s pretty unusual to just hit a home run out of the park. Actually, I just wanted to briefly mention that retargeting campaigns using Facebook ads will often yield you the highest return on ad spend. 

Audiences can be thought of as cold, medium, and warm. Cold audiences are the people who have no idea about your website, that you’re showing an ad to the first time. Warm audiences are people that have taken valuable actions like viewed your product, added to cart, or initiate checkout. 

Generally speaking, a return on ad spend (ROAS = amount spent divided by amount earned) of 2.00 would be typical, 3.00 - 7.00 is not unreasonable with a good offer, and I’ve seen it go as high as 28.00 (ie spend $1 and get $28 back) with particularly well priced and good offers. 

There’s plenty of tutorials on how to do this (just google it), but I wanted to point out that this is a very important piece of the Shopify puzzle, if you’re running Facebook ads.

Running a 14 day VC/ATC campaign (excluding purchases) is a good way to start at a $5 per day budget. If your frequency creeps above 1 per day, then definitely lower your budget (as it means you are showing the same ad to the same people too many times). 

In terms of creative, a dynamic carousel typically works well. Again, won’t go into the details here, as there’s other people who can show you how. 

There’s other forms of retargeting - eg Conversio/Klaviyo, Recart, SMS - but Facebook ads is fairly easy to set up too. I think it’s definitely worth a shop if you’re getting a fair bit of traffic to your store already. 

I spent a few thousand in Facebook ad spend for my own Shopify store and retargeting still does the best out of all the campaigns I run usually. Other marketers echo the same results, too. 

Just thought I’d contribute some content of value to this sub, hope it’s useful. Can drill down more into specifics if you feel like asking.",24,46,2019-06-11,ECOM,0.03430059552192688,0.9157262444496155,0.049973178654909134

shopify,5 mistakes you're probably making that cost you money - Part 2,"The first article was a success and a lot of you asked me for a second part. So here it is 🙂

If you missed the first part, you can check it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/buz3fg/5_mistakes_youre_probably_making_that_cost_you/).

## Too Many Apps:

This happens way too often – New store owners that install a crazy amount of apps when they didn’t even bring 1 visitor. Fortune wheels, scratchcard popups, “someone from \*random country\* bought this” notifications, counters and more…

Save your money! Having a successful dropshipping store is not an easy task. With advertising costs going up on almost every platform, every dollar you save counts and you must manage your budget wisely in order to have a better success rate.

Focus on finding the right product, optimise your store so it loads up fast and install only a few must have apps. Apps like Abandonment Protector that does a great job reducing abandoned checkouts(we have no affiliation with this app).

And you should also compare app prices. Sometimes you can find more than 1 app that does exactly what you need.

## Spending Too Much On Design:

Repeat after me: “I will not pay $100 for a logo. I will not buy a premium theme when I can install one for free. I will save my money for the important stuff first!!!.”

It drives me crazy when I hear how much time and money beginners spend on their store. I know a lot of successful dropshippers and they can create a good looking shopify store in a couple of hours while investing only a fraction of the money.

I know that having a good logo and design on your store is important, but it doesn’t have too cost you so much. You can get a normal looking logo for $15\~$30 and install one of the free themes and trust me that your store will look great!

You don’t need to pay hundreds of dollars as if you’re an offline brand going online. Keep your store simple, fast, clean and everything will be alright.

## No Sticky Cart Button:

One of the most important lessons I learned – What’s obvious to me isn’t obvious to my customers.

When I browse online and swipe down to read the product’s description, I then swipe up to find the “Add to Cart” button to order the product. This is obvious to me and to you but unfortunately such simple task isn’t obvious to A LOT of people.

So by not having a sticky cart button, some of the customers get lost and leave the store. Or tap back and end up on Facebook again, getting all confused and stuff…

**You have to chew everything up and spit it out for your customers.**

\*Some themes have a sticky cart button by default and some don’t. If you don’t have a sticky cart button, you can get one by installing an app.\*

## Not Recording Your Customers:

By not recording your customers, you will have a really hard time understanding what went wrong.

For example: A customer clicks the “Add to Cart” button, goes to the cart page and leaves. Not a special case, really common actually… But upon checking the recording of my store, I noticed that the item was added twice to the cart. So my customers were a bit confused and didn’t know how to remove 1 item so they left without buying. It also could be that some of them thought that it was a “cheap trick” to get them to buy 2 items, so they left.

By recording your customers you can see how they respond to your store, identify bugs and fix them. You can use Hotjar to record your customers. Easy to install and you won’t need more than the free plan.

## Not Transferring Your Customers Straight To Cart Page:

If on your store clicking the “Add to Cart” button doesn’t transfer the customer straight to the cart page, then you’re losing money as we speak!

Some of the themes (Free &amp; Premium) have an ajax cart or some other cart style installed by default. If that’s the case on your store, go and change it quickly so your customers are transferred to the cart page.

This is a really important setting that can affect your store’s conversion rate. These stylish slider/popup carts may look good but they drastically reduce your store’s conversion rate because it either confuses your customers or it doesn’t look good on their mobile device.

And it’s preferable to get our customers to quickly buy the product and later we can offer them more stuff. It’s much easier to convert an existing customer 😉

ecommerce,Best E Commerce Platform? (Currently on Shopify),"Hey Guys, I have had my store on Shopify for quite some time now, but am consistently running into a number of issues which are making me wonder if this is the appropriate platform for me.   


The biggest issue is Lack of customization for themes: It looks like you buy a theme and thats what you get. You can obviously add apps for this or that, but adding apps seems to hinder speed and performance and ends up adding alot of $$ to my monthly shopify fee.    


I hired a 3rd party web developer to make fundamental tweaks to my current shopify theme.  however whenever any other work is done to the site that always seems to butterfly out and cause issues with the site. I feel like I am constantly trying to get the site to work properly and have the theme customized to how I would like to it flow and feel.  


Does anyone have recommendations for a platform that is similar to Shopify but is more access-able to customization through coding?  IE they use a more standard web language rather than their own customized shopfiy langauge.   


Keep in mind I am running a clothing store, and that I have ALOT of products to list and have neatly sorted etc. And I also personally know nothing about coding or web design, everything I need done to the site will be done through hiring someone.

shopify,Do lazy dropshippers skew the success rate?,Real question: do you think most ecomm / dropship sites fail because the person puts in zero effort and doesnt do any proper work to making it a long term project and success and just think its a get rich quick effort.

I think there are a lot of people on this sub who do try to put in the work and make an hinest effort and dont see success for one reason or another. But I also see a lot of crap.

ecommerce,Why A lot of E-Commerce Shops Fail (Even when they are bringing in $50k-$100k/MONTH),"Edit 1: So it appears that several people have reported this post to the admins, mostly because they’re uncomfortable taking advice from a stranger on the internet. I’m going to put a disclaimer on any posts I make in the future to try and avoid any headaches for the admins, I truthfully enjoy that I’ve been able to do something positive for a few people here and would like to continue doing so unless that is going to cause an actual problem. Thank you.
——————-

Hey so if you saw my post the other day you'd know that I do marketing and consulting for a lot of e-commerce shops and a lot of them come to me with the same exact questions. You guys liked the advice I gave the other day so I figured why not waste some time today as well giving out some more.

&amp;#x200B;

The advice is actually in similar perspective as the last post. I gave the argument that a lot of the time the issue in your Facebook ads is the content not the targeting. Well today we're talking about analytical data and how it's probably clouding your judgement.

&amp;#x200B;

So I often sit in meetings with new prospects and clients who want to grow their business, and one of the first things I  notice is a lot of the business owners are HEAVILY focused on trackable data for their product (rightfully so, you want to be able to see the numbers of whether something is working) But man o' man I sit there and have to get them to understand that focusing on that data too much can lead to disaster. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are two types of marketing strategies, Short-Term marketing strategies and Long-Term Marketing Strategies.

A short-term strategy is something like Facebook Ads, which is simply &lt;Create content, target audience, and watch immediate sales and data&gt; Which sure for any business doing less than $50k in revenue, keep doing that until it grows more. On the other hand, long-term strategies involve creating a brand name for the company this is simply another way of saying ""your companies reputation"" It involves how people think of your company, whether it's trustworthy, whether the customer service actually cares, what vision people see when they hear your companies name. All the big (and moderately big) companies in the world have built a brand name for themselves to make the company seem more approachable and inviting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things like this are built over a long period of time, BUT the return you get from building a brand is MUCH higher than the return from short term marketing, that's because with a well known brand, you don't need to spend the same amount of money to get a customer, people genuinely want to be YOUR customer. 

&amp;#x200B;

And how do you build a brand? Organic tactics for long periods of time, Outbound engagement on social media, creating viral actions that people talk about through social media (reference [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) who recently went viral when someone made a post saying they asked to return their unopened dog food when their dog had died and Chewy not only said yes but sent them a handmade oil painting of their pet, after the OP posted this it turns out Chewy has been doing this for years.) There is no way to track whether that action was positive through day to day analytics, it took time to see if it would make any difference, yet it still felt like the right thing to do, and they continued paying someone to make the paintings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this helps inspire some ideas, I tried not to ramble too much. Enjoy your Thursday Folks!",26,66,2019-06-13,ECOM,0.03142787143588066,0.9295647740364075,0.039007361978292465

ecommerce,[UK] Best way to handle returns on a card game?,"Hi,

I’ve created my own card game that I’ll be selling on my shoplift store. My product will be shrink wrapped/ have a cello wrap.

As I’m in the UK, customers can ask for a refund within 30 days as long as the product has been unopened.

My question is, how do I handle returns on a product like this if a customer has opened it?

My initial thought was to offer a 50% refund as the product has been opened provided they send the item back, is this unacceptable?

dropship,My awful experience with Printful - Any Alternatives to suggest?,"I have been attempting to start up a POD T-shirt business for the last month or so to sell some horse-themed designs that I came up with late last year. I eventually found Printful as it is the big dog in the POD game. I did an initial test order and it worked wonderfully, I had my product in about 5 days and everything went without a hitch.  


I decided it all looked good and I launched my Shopify store. I got two domestic orders relatively quickly, but then issues with printful began to arise. It took about 8 days before they even started the fulfillment process, and as soon as they did they told me several of the shirts that my customer ordered were discontinued and that I had to edit the order. I talked to my customer and had to explain that even though we had the order for over a week we had to make a change to it. She was frustrated but understood. I made the edit and ten days later the fulfillment process still isn't finished, nor has it even begun on the alternative color shirt that I had to choose for my customer. It will end up being about 3 weeks total before she gets her product.  


The second order was from this same customer (she had forgot two other shirts that she wanted). It took even longer than the first one to start the process, but then when they finally did start I got the same discontinued message and had to go back to the same customer and explain that we had the same problem as before. This one still hasn't even begun the fulfillment process. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to Printful support and they explained that there is no way to estimate when the products will ship (nothing I can tell to my customer) and no way to mitigate the risk that the ordered products become discontinued. Basically nothing I can do but wait as my customer waits.  


I dont think I will be using Printful anymore. Any suggestions for an alternative?",12,22,2019-06-14,ECOM,0.14457574486732483,0.8302126526832581,0.0252116359770298

dropship,Terra e-commerce...I dodged a bullet,"I figured this would be the best place to get some kind of clarity i guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw an ad on IG for this dropshipping site

[https://terra-commerce.com/](https://terra-commerce.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

I went ahead and tried to schedule a call and after a few times of no one calling, i finally got through to someone and they explained the whole mentoring/prebuilt aspect. I signed up, feeling a little more reassured and under the assumption my payment would be done through the site. After signing up they then tell me I'll get a google pay request to pay the 175 for both services. And not too long after, I get a message from a mentor who's email is riddled with errors.

&amp;#x200B;

I think nada of it at first but then I message him again and even on a simpler email there's errors which, makes me even more suspicious tbh.  But fuck it, im desperate at this point and send the 175. Surely for this amount of money, Day later, I hit him up asking whats up with the progress and i hear nothing back. Then I do some more poking around the site and their legal section has basically nothing on it. There's Terms, Customers and Partners, Policies and Procedures, and our space and partners are listed but there's no detail on any of em. I even poke around here and see that theres 2 posts advising against the site. Luckily enough, the payment didnt go through so i declined the request....WHEW.

dropship,What FB ads strategy are you guys using?,"I have tested 27 products on my store: [http://storenextblock.com](http://storenextblock.com) and have spent over $850 in adspend for NO SALES! 

I use the conversion objective as 'Purchase'. Do a single $10 Adset with a target audience of 500k to 2M people depending upon the interests. 

One key thing to note is that FB shows ""&lt;10 conversions"" no matter what type of targeting I select. 

I close the adset down if it has no purchases after 3 days. This has been the case with most of my adsets.

Coming to the ad creatives, I use the most high quality images to make a short 6-10 second video via Facebook's editor to showcase my products, I have also made multiple ad videos myself by taking clips from Youtube and other places.

I don't know what exactly I am doing wrong. I would argue most of my products meet at least two of the common criteria-

1. Rare / Not available at Walmart

2. Makes the customer look good 

3. High perceived value

4. Ads show social proof / spark curiosity

shopify,Shopify SEO Tips: your step-by-step guide to rank #1,"While Shopify provides the store owners with various inbuilt SEO hacks and techniques, they are certainly not enough if you want to stand out from your competition. Follow these tips for Shopify SEO and make your store visible.

In this digital era, setting up a store that is technologically advanced, loads with lightning speed and with perfectly optimized user-generated content cannot necessarily get you to the top rank. This is where a well-planned SEO strategy comes into action This blog gives you some quick Shopify SEO tips which will help you stand out from your competitors.

**Improving SEO for** [Shopify store](https://www.perceptionsystem.com/shopify-development-company.html)**:**

When it’s an online store, the basic concern is how to get a customer to your store. In a recent retail study conducted by Google, it was discovered that more than 75% of customers seek refuge to a search engine to find their desired product.

Shopify has a lot of inbuilt tricks and techniques that can help you achieve top ranking.

Here are some of the best Shopify [SEO tips](https://www.perceptionsystem.com/seo-services-company.html) to help you get more visibility to your online store.

**STEP 1: Simplify your Shopify site structure:**

To make your store user-friendly, it is important to have a simplified site structure wherein the product page is easily accessible and does not have to go through the unnecessary hierarchy of categories and sub-categories before landing to the desired product page.

This way, a customer can spend more time on your site, and explore it generating more business.

This is how your site navigation should be built for your customers:

**Homepage » Category Pages » Product Pages**

**Homepage » Category Pages » Sub-Category Page » Product Pages**

Thus, a simpler site structure lets the search engines crawl your site faster and rank your products higher.

**STEP 2: Plan your keywords:**

One of the most important parts of Shopify SEO is choosing the right set of keywords. To plan and select your keywords, you need to do proper research first.

Put yourself in your customers' shoes and think of them in this way:

*What phrases will your customer be using while looking for the desired product?*

Make a list of such keywords.  You can also take into account [Google Adwords’ Keyword Planner ](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/)to do thorough keyword research for your store.

**STEP 3: Optimize your File Names and URL**

One of the major areas concerning Shopify and SEO, which is often neglected, is your URL. Your Shopify site URL must be short, clear and keyword rich if possible. Often, more than one URLs are generated for the same page because of various methods to get to the same product.

The search engine identifies this as duplicate content and is harmful to your page ranking. Shopify takes care of this and generates canonical URLs, which prevents multiple URL creation.

Read more about [canonical URLs here](https://www.shopify.in/partners/blog/canonical-urls).  
 

The same feature implies to your filenames. While uploading any file, make sure it is optimized for SEO, which a proper keyword containing descriptions.

**STEP 4: Build links for your store:**

Search engines use backlinks to find out how much the community values your site. This is an off-page optimization strategy that helps build reliable backlinks for your site and can be achieved by the following means:

**Supplier/Manufacturer Links**

If you are a drop shipper, get yourself an authorized retailer link from your manufacturers. Send them an e-mail requesting to link your store with their website.

**Influencer Voice/Marketing**

Influencer marketing generates more content and links for your store then any other practice. You might be mentioned at a number of places without you being aware of it. Use [mention.com](https://mention.com/en/) to find such places and add these links to your store.

**Step 5. Optimize Your Shopify Products Pages**

After setting up the right site structure and choosing the list of keywords, your store needs to be optimized for SEO.

&amp;#x200B;

**What pages to optimize?**

Set your title tags by keeping in mind the following context:

&amp;#x200B;

**Keyword 1 – Shop for Keyword 2 – Store Name**

**Optimize the title and meta description for Products:**

Create a unique meta description for your product and category pages. However, remember to avoid stuffing it with keywords.

Next, optimizing the **alt text** of all the images with the correct set of keywords can help give a boost to your rankings.

That’s it, inventors! Follow these quick steps and quickly escalate your keywords to Rank 1. Do not forget to make sure the site speed is up to mark. A website with less load time and seemingly interesting products attract more customers.

dropship,Dropshipping Beginner,"Hi,

I'm planning to start dropshipping but I have hit a wall. Let me introduce myself first. My name is Kelvin and I am trying to make money online. So far I have an affiliate website which is doing quite well and growing.

And I plan on getting into dropshipping. After researching and putting the necessary things into place. I realised I have hit a wall and it'd big. The wall is payment processors.

I have search high and low on how process customers money and I can't find any solution. I am from Ghana, West Africa. So this is like solving the problem on hard mode.

So far what I have done is to create a paypal account thanks to a friend. I also have a payoneer account. And recently I had a transferwise account which has been deactivated. I had no money in it. The only thing I have done is to link it to my paypal account. That's it.

I have Stripe but verifying the information is a pain because my country is not in the list. Transferwise would have things easier. But like I said its blocked. I also don't want to risk my payoneer account.

So the plan was to get a virtual US bank account. But can't seem to find any other services that does that. I really want to learn and get into dropshipping. But this thing is holding me back. What's the point of dropshipping if you can't process payments?

I can't also go to the US to create a bank account. I was thinking of getting this virtual US post mail to create one. Is it a feasible option?

If there are alternatives to Payoneer or transferwise. I would like to know.

&amp;#x200B;

ecommerce,Google Shopping doesn't allow watermarks but I worry about competitors stealing product images - is this the wrong mentality?,"In my niche I'm selling the same brands and products everyone else is.

But I'm more focused on bundles of items and goto great lengths to produce great imagery to showoff and highlight the products as much as possible.

I use a very subtle watermark on these images (people still steal them, I've seen ebay listings using them etc), so atleast I have the small benefit of some branding.

Google Shopping is the next step, but as they don't allow any watermarking for the product images I'm very hesitant to start a campaign with watermark free imagery.

Is this the wrong mentality to have?

Is it more damaging to my business to not pursue a potential source of new sales  than it is to risk competitors using my images to sell the same products.

ecommerce,Pre-sales questions over the phone,"We have a website selling items from about 10 dollars to 5500 dollars. We publish a number on the website for people to call for with pre-sale questions. 

In analyzing my data, I find that the people who call in and speak with us for more than 5 or so minutes (or email a lot, for that matter) aren't all that likely to buy. It may be that we are just bad at selling, but I truly believe we have a good product that offers a good value relative to the competition. I just tend to find that we end up talking on the phone with people for 30 minutes about how their uncle used to have a similar product, or lengthy discussions about competitor products they used to own that didn't satisfy them and often get nothing more than a ""well, I'll think some more about it and get back with you guys."" Meanwhile, someone else will have spent $3000 on the website with us without so much as an email inquiry. It makes me wonder if handling the incoming inquiries is ""worth it."" Quite often, we are spending time explaining information to callers that is clearly expressed on the website. Perhaps I've been spoiled by e-commerce, but I often think that if you have to answer a question that was already answered in the first sentence of the product page, the caller isn't really interested in the first place.

Don't get me wrong, I really like to talk to people about what we offer. It is quite literally fun for me to come to understand their needs and talk to them about what in our line addresses that. I just can't help but think that we might be devoting a lot of time to people that want to take a test drive but never actually intend to buy, so to speak.

shopify,10 proven ways to optimize your Shopify store,"10 Ways to Optimize Your Online Store Performance

 

As an owner of an eCommerce store, we all have our priorities, but when it comes to the online store performance, every one appears to be on the same wavelength. That’s because the very survival of an eCommerce site depends on how it performs instead of what it delivers. Even the best-designed website offering the most in-demand products will not amount to much if it’s not able to attract qualified visitors to the site.

The success of an eCommerce store is strongly tied to the online traffic and its conversion rates. The greater the online traffic, higher will be the conversion rates resulting in increased revenues and profits. The opposite is the case with reduced online traffic resulting in lacklustre online store performance. Below you will learn 10 ways to optimize the online store performance for increased online revenues and profits.

1. Pick the Right Domain Name

The importance of choosing the right domain name cannot be emphasized enough to improve your online store performance. The domain name you choose should be related to what you are offering to the customers. For instance, if you are selling shoes and sandals, you must ensure that the domain name contains one or more products that you are offering on the site

Remember the shorter the domain name, the easier it will be for your customers to recall the name.  So, when planning to buy the product or services consider using “best-shoes.com” or “affordable-sandles.com” instead of “best-affordable-shoes-sandles.com”

2. Include High Impression Relevant Keywords

In order to boost online store performance, you must include high impression andrelevant keywords in your website content. The keywords should be included in the website title, headings, body, and product, and meta description of the every page.

Including relevant keywords will ensure that your site attracts qualified targeted customers, while using high impression keywords will increase the chance of obtaining maximum number of online visitors. You can get detailed information on high impression and relevant keywords by using Google’s Keyword Planner tool.

Just keep in mind that you should avoid overstuffing the keywords in your site’s content, otherwise Google will penalize your website. You must try to keep the keyword density to 1% on a single page to stay safe.

3. Make Contact Information Visible for the Visitors

Another way you can optimize your online sale performance is by displaying the contact information prominently on every page of the website. It’s recommended that you place the contact information in the website header. This will make it easier for online visitors to contact you to get more information about the product or service, and eventually make a purchase.

4. Display Products on the Main Page

According to a consumer study, around 71% of shoppers preferred to have the product displayed on the front page of the website. This was regarded as an influential factor in making a purchase from the online store. You should consider displaying your most popular products (in terms of sales) on the front page of the website. This will have a positive effect on your online store performance.

5. Focus on Link Building

Link building is among the most important tasks for boosting search engine rankingsand online traffic. Search engine determines the popularity of your website by the quantity of high quality links that point to your website.  The more popular your website in terms of inbound links, the greater will be its ranking in SERPs.

6. Optimize Page Load Time

Page load time refers to the time it takes for the website to display its content on the screen. A faster loading time will create more pleasant user experience. This will provide benefit to your online store in two ways:

·         It will decrease the bounce rate that refers to people exiting the site immediately due to slow load time

·         It will improve the search engine rankings as Google places sites with faster page loading speed higher in the search results

The end result will be improved online store performance due to the increased online traffic and conversion rates.

7. Submit Site Map to Improve Search Engine Visibility

You must submit a site map to improve search engine visibility. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing use site maps to determine which content to include in their search engines. Submitting site maps will ensure that the search engines properly index all your WebPages resulting in increased store performance.

8. The 10-Seconds Tests

Most online visitors leave a site in about 10 seconds if it doesn’t offer a clear proposition. In order to properly evaluate the site, you must put yourself in the shoes of the customers and ask the following two questions:

·         Do I want to stay on the site for more than 10 seconds?

·         Does the site offer clear value proposition i.e. why I should buy from this site?

If you cannot answers the above questions, it’s time that you consider revamping the site. You must get in touch with a professional website design firm to determine the areas that you need to improve your online store performance.

9. Address Potential Problems

As a website owner, you should be empathetic to the feelings of the customers. In other words, you must proactively address potential problems and objections regarding the product to boost your online store performance. A generous returns and replacement policy will provide assurance to the customers that the company would compensate them in case of defect in the product resulting in improved online performance.

10. Promotional Offers and Discounts

Customers are always on the lookout for special deals to save cost on purchase. You can significantly boost your online store performance by offering promotional offers and discounts to the customers during special occasions like Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.

So, the next time you get down to designing your ecommerce site, make sure that you incorporate all the tips and advices listed above to outshine, outpace and outsmart your digital competitors.

shopify,"Facebook Ads Pro Tip: When starting ads, don't use Purchase objectives, use PPE instead","Just going to drop some valuable information here for people who are just starting out with Facebook ads or those who have run a few already.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One of the very common tactics for using Facebook ads profitably is using **Page Post Engagement** as the conversion objective for their *first* campaign, rather than going straight for the purchase.

There's a few really good reasons for this:

* Most importantly, it allows you to **collect data quicker**. By looking at your CPC, CPM, and CTR for your ads, you can tell objectively which one is the winner, and if you're spending even as little as $20 you can usually see one starting to outperform the other.
* The second main reason is that **social proof on Facebook ads will help your conversions.** It does so from both a technical perspective and an intuitive perspective. The technical perspective is that it's believed Facebook lowers your CPM and therefore your cost IF your audience/post is more engaging, as it's seen as more relevant to its users - which seems consistent with Facebook's overall goal of wanting to keep users on its platform longer. The intuitive perspective is that a post with 1k likes and 100 comments that say ""I want this product"" seems a lot more legitimate than an ad without any, and - especially on Instagram ads - you see a pattern of social proof really making a difference to conversions.

That said, *most* people (and I'm talking successful YouTubers who dropship as well as digital agencies who manage a few million in sales) would start to use the data they got from their PPE campaigns and *then* create a separate campaign where the winning ad is used with a Purchase objective campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Many people ask the question: ""**what conversion should I optimise for?**"" Facebook officially recommends optimising for as high up the funnel as is possible to get 50 actions per week (e.g. if you're not getting 50 purchases per week, but you are getting 50 AddToCarts per week, then use AddToCart as the optimisation objective). **But in reality, most people find more success optimising for the Purchase objective** (**after they've proven a winner with the PPE campaign**). I've only ever seen &lt;10% of people ever actually make better purchases from a non-Purchase-objective conversion campaign, and they were testing like crazy (few k ad spend per day) so it was a rare diamond too.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: I think my post has been slightly misinterpreted from what I meant to say.** As several others have rightly pointed out, you’re not going to get sales from a PPE campaign by itself. **Purchase objective is far superior and Facebook optimises for purchases better if you use a Purchase objective**. 

The actual point I was trying to make with this post was that you should distinctly use PPE to 1. Find your winning ad to quickly, 2. Build some social proof. However, **you will want to create a Purchase objective campaign with the winning ad/audience from the PPE.** PPE is a data collection exercise, not a sales exercise. 

The specific reason for this post is sometimes newer people just go straight for a Purchase objective campaign, without having any clue what their winning ad is. So PPE prevents that. You may not get sales but your CTR/CPC will guide you.

dropship,[HELP] Characteristics of a winning/profitable product,"Hi guys,

Newbie question alert.

So I just paused the campaign of 1 product after more than 2 days of testing and am trying to learn from its KPIs for future testings. Here are the details and stats:

CBO campaign, 15 single interest adsets. Daily Budget: $40

Results after 2.5 days:

Amount spent: $100

CPC: $.52

CTR: 1.1%

CPM: $5.82

Unique link clicks: 174

Unique ATCs: 15

2 purchases

From these numbers, I did some math and am kinda confused.

In the case above, it costs **$.5 per visitor**. So to get **100 visitors** the cost would be **$50**. Let's say your store has an average conversion rate (**CR**) of **2%**, so you would expect to get **2 purchases** per **100 visitors** on average. Regarding the product, assume you have a **margin** of **$15**, and so **2 purchases** would earn you **$30**. But since you are paying **$50** to get the traffic of those 100 visitors, you are actually **losing** **$50-$30=$20** in total.

So, for you to be profitable either CPC has to reduce so traffic would cost less or CR increases so there are more purchases, or margin increases to cover ad expense. However, and I can be wrong, according to what I researched, CPC of $.5 and CR of 2% are pretty standard. So the only option left is to either pick a product with a higher margin or increase AOV through upselling and cross-selling. In details, each purchase has to be of $25 value to break even ($25\*2=$50) and more to be profitable. In terms of ROAS, $50 revenue/$50 ads spent=1=BEP.

Since I'm totally new to the game, I would appreciate if anyone could justify whether or not what's said above is correct. Also, are winning products that are scalable basically those with good CR (like 4%-10%) and good margin (&gt;$25)?",13,12,2019-06-22,ECOM,0.029936688020825386,0.9000856876373291,0.06997757405042648

ecommerce,"Need advice on creating a ""merch store"" for my indie game","I'm the owner and operator an indie game brand, and I want to create a merch store for it, because it'd probably be pretty quick to do and I already have some stuff that would be good on shirts etc. (I've made some one-offs for live events which I could put up for others to buy).

However, it's been a fair few years since I last looked into this so I don't know where to do it. I first looked at SharkRobot, where some of the merch shirts I've bought in the past are based, but it looks like they only partner with people at their discretion and I'm not really big-time enough to approach a business like that.

Where should I go? I thought people here might be able to make some recommendations. Ideally, the site needs to serve the following requirements...

* Allow me to set up some kind of storefront/landing page which features my designs
* Allow users to buy things **without** having to go through an extensive account creation process (i.e. they do Paypal checkout or one-off orders or similar)
* Offer tee-shirts; this is the primary reason. Other merch is nice also, I mean why not, but shirts are the main purpose

So I have set up my site, set up my products; pretty much everything on the site is ready for customers.

I have used Facebook ads in the past, and have always been able to turn a small profit, but I have never pushed myself to scale up. I think it’s the fear of losing a lot of money, and spending it and never being able to get it back.

shopify,How to nail your cart abandonment emails,"Hey Reddit! Did you know that your cart / checkout abandonment email is *the* most powerful automated emails for your Shopify store and could recover a significant portion of your lost sales? But you’ve gotta do it right.

(Spoiler: you’re doing it wrong if your first abandonment email includes a discount.)

Over time, I’ve been developing a simple ten-step process to send really effective cart abandonment emails. Here’s how it works:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Focus on customer service**

Your email should make customers feel wanted; by being friendly and supportive, not pushy. Going all-in with a heavy-handed sales pitch (like offering a discount coupon) and using cheesy urgency (“oh no, we’re running out of stock”) won’t do the trick.

Instead, send a gentle - and genuinely helpful - reminder asking if they need help with anything, including a direct link to the checkout. Here’s a great example from Ugmonk:

[https://www.reallygoodemails.com/industry/ecommerce/offering-you-my-personal-email/](https://www.reallygoodemails.com/industry/ecommerce/offering-you-my-personal-email/)

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Segment your cart / checkout abandonment emails**

Segmented emails have a 14% higher open rate, and a whopping 100% higher click-through rate than their unsegmented counterparts ([here's the study from Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/effects-of-list-segmentation-on-email-marketing-stats/))

When it comes to cart abandonment emails, an example of segmenting would be by cart value, cart size, customer type (new vs. returning), and whether or not a customer already has a discount applied.

My favorite? Offering a free shipping discount to first-time customers to make it easier for them to try the product

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Grab readers' inbox attention**

126 emails drop into the average inbox every day. To get eyeballs on your cart abandonment email use a specific subject line like ""Your Brand Basket"" and send it from a friendly email address like [yourname@yourbrand.com](mailto:yourname@yourbrand.com).

No need to reinvent the wheel here, and yet I still see brands sending cart abandonment emails from a noreply address...

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Send mobile-first cart abandonment emails**

A non-mobile optimized email that’s slow to load, hard to read and tricky to interact with will be deleted faster than you can say “cart abandonment”. Oops.

Here are some quick tips to make sure your cart abandonment emails look good on mobile:

* Body copy: 16px+
* Headline: 22px+
* Calls to action: Touch targets (make sure they’re tappable)

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Personalization is the name of the game**

Don’t just personalize someone’s name. Try to personalize products too, and set it up so that your emails dynamically insert the specific product that your customer had in their cart into the cart abandonment email itself.

Nothing is more effective at reminding your customers how excited they felt when they first saw your product as an image showing it in its full glory.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Do not send all image emails**

Words should communicate important information; images should enhance those words. Not the other way around. An image-heavy email will be slow to load, and quickly deleted… and will almost certainly mean your email ends up in the spam folder.

[https://twitter.com/lovevalgeisler/status/1115602280273682433](https://twitter.com/lovevalgeisler/status/1115602280273682433)

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Have a clear call to action**

Vis-a-vis point 1: cart abandonment emails should be friendly, not pushy. So your CTA needs to follow suite: “complete my order” or “finish checking out” should seal the deal.

As Joanna Wiebe from Copy Hackers [suggests](https://copywritematters.com/calls-action-tips-smart-marketers-know/), a good rule of thumb when it comes to writing calls to action is to put your reader in the midst of the action.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Send multiple emails**

One nudge, two nudges, three nudges: always send more than one email to rescue abandoned cart revenue, ideally over the course of 72 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Keep your discounts close to your chest**

This is my biggest pet peeve. Introduce discounts as an incentive in emails two or three — you’ve nothing to gain from offering a discount in your first cart abandonment email.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Send the first email 30-60 minutes after abandonment**

Any sooner, and it might be too high-pressure. Any longer, and you risk losing momentum. Strike while the iron is hot… but not *too* hot. And remember, now is not the time to offer a discount. Just reach out with an attitude of helpful customer service.

ecommerce,Anybody here run a boutique-style ecommerce shop single-handedly with products that you don't make?,"I have a couple questions for people like me:  I sell merchandise manufactured by others (typically other small companies).  I've designed my shop around my personality, with a strong story and a personal connection.  My value add is fast response to customers, fast shipping, focus on the customer and not solely profit and being friendly and relatable.  Kind of a small town shop vibe that's online.  

This is what a lot of ""new"" marketers say to do (which is different from the ""pound them with ads and email campaigns until they buy"" old-style marketing).  So this approach is working for me up to a point.  One of my product lines is selling very well, but I don't think it will sustain the business enough to even bring me a salary.  This is my 4th year and my numbers are creeping upward.  Great trajectory, just very, very slow.  I want to increase the sales of the other product lines.

This year I've been running constant Google ads.  Marketing is my weak point, so I'm learning as I go.  I'm always struggling with trying various ideas:

* move into a brick and mortar (because in-person vending events bring me a lot of money, but will need a loan to get started)
* hire someone to do digital marketing, likely the best way to maintain my personality in the marketing but is more than I can afford without a loan
* hire digital marketing consultancy, maybe cost less than hiring a full time person but not sure how to maintain my personality through what they do
* keep doing what I'm doing but increase my google ad spend
* just take a chill pill, continue what I'm doing and be patient

So the reason I asked for people in a similar type of shop as me, is I'd like to know if you also have this struggle.  I also want to hear from people who do NOT make their own products, because then you have less competition.  When you make your own products you can make them distinct from the competition but when you sell the same things other people sell then it's all about ""why you should buy from me and not Amazon"".  In addition to the list above, I wonder if my distinct personality and story are just not enough to convince people.  Not coincidentally, all the products that don't sell well for me can be found on Amazon and elsewhere.

Okay, so if you're in the same boat as me and doing well, can I ask what approach you took to bringing in sales?  How much on average do you spend on marketing per month?",17,8,2019-06-28,ECOM,0.0386376678943634,0.9178133010864258,0.043549004942178726

I run a few Shopify stores and have spent about $6 - 7k in Facebook ads, so just starting this thread to say that the truth is that you should test a LOT rather than just assuming your Facebook ads aren't working. You basically need to hit the right audiences with the right creative and the right offer, in order to convert.

So if you have any particular ads about Facebook ads that aren't solved by an easy google search, please fire away and I'll try to answer from my own experiences. I don't do $15k/day of ad spend like some people do, but just wanting to share a bit of useful knowledge/guidance.

ecommerce,Question about print-on-demand,"Hey guys,

I'm building my wordpress + woocommerce store in a niche that I really like. I'm still very new to this business and have just started out, so please don't blame me for my inexperience.

The products I want to sell are T-Shirts, Posters, Mugs, maybe engraved glasses and then some other niche related stuff.

I started looking into Printful prices, and realized that it will be nearly impossible to make this store profitable, since the cheapest ""good quality"" T-Shirt (Bella Canvas 3001) costs me 13.61€ + 4.45€ shipping to Germany, so in total 18,06€. Since I do not have a way to drive free traffic to this store, I am almost guaranteed to lose money with paid advertising, because of that slim profit margin.

Everything above 20-22€ for a T-Shirt is too expensive in my opinion, so this would leave me with a very slim profit margin of 2-4€. It's even worse for posters since they cost me around 16€, and I wanted to sell it for this price.

Mugs same story, cost me around 14€ so can't even put a margin on it.

I am wondering if anyone has a realistic solution to this, to me it's not a solution to sell a mug for 20€ or a T-Shirt for 25€, or a poster for 20€ because that price is gonna turn away most customers. I have also researched quite a bit into different print-on-demand websites, but most of them look kinda crappy, have bad reviews or have similar prices.

ecommerce,How do you start selling online if you already have a physical store?,"We have a small clothing store and we were thinking about selling online from the beginning but when we started to take action we hit some roadblocks, the thing is we can't find a good and efficient solution for managing our inventory, taking photos, editing the photos, getting the dimensions and other data about the products that we want to sell online.

Creating the website is not a problem for us, we're going to use Woocommerce, we thought about importing our products from a CSV file that we are going to create and will contain the products information, prices, image URLs... instead of creating each product manually in the dashboard, but this is going to be time consuming and maybe not that efficient.

We thought that there should be a better solution and we would like to ask you guys how are you doing this?

What are the steps that you take to publish a product for sale online?

Are you using any special software or plugins? Should we just continue using a CSV file to create the products data?

Thanks.",13,9,2019-06-29,ECOM,0.025137826800346375,0.9270556569099426,0.04780648276209831

ecommerce,Selling dog toys online.,"So i plan on drop shipping dog toys online. This will be my second drop shipping store, I had a jewelry one but that did not workout because i did not realize how hard and competitive that niche was. so i scrapped that and decided to go with something easier. 

Dogs are the most popular pet and i have one of my own so i do love dogs, I plan to use him for taking photos as well. 

What do I need to know?

Is this good for starting?

ecommerce,Looking for feedback,"The e-commerce space is something which has been really fascinating me for a while. Been going through the subreddit, youtube, twitter, etc., and research on how people are running their online shop...trying to understand how they handle their day to day operations.

- My hypothesis is that a lot of store owners start out with interesting products and then have issues with scaling because of: 
 - technical issues + 
 - customer support + 
 - digital marketing ofc +
  - not having enough time to understand the analytics which can lead to effective marketing.


- I have freelancer friends who do customer support, digital marketing, machine learning and me ofc whose been doing web dev for some time now, so I've discussed with them and they are interested in offering their services to help store owners. This way we could be the technical backbone of stores.

- The mechanism we would be having would be a productized service. For a fixed price every month we handle all the marketing, customizations and customer support for your store. 

- By the way, during my research, I've been reading on how many customers abandon the cart during the checkout process...one way to tackle that would be with sending them an email nudging them to complete the checkout (something which can be covered in the digital marketing offering). 

- Store owners can solely focus on their products and their business.


Now it can very likely be that the product is something people don't want and the above said efforts would likely fail in that condition, but my hypothesis was assuming that people who have their products validated by markets and are now having a tough time in scaling.


What do you guys think?

- Have I diagnosed the right problem?
- Do you as store owners prefer an in-house team in comparison to outsourcing such issues?
- What change would you want/need in such an offering to make it work for you?",6,11,2019-06-30,ECOM,0.06151014193892479,0.9102449417114258,0.028244882822036743
