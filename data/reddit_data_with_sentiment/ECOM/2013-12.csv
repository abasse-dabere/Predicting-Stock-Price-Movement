ecommerce,What is the conventional wisdom these days about niche-specific landing pages on a single domain vs. a bunch of separate niche sites?,"Our site is in a domain that has a lot of sub-niches which we'd like to optimize for, but we would like to keep everything under a single domain unless there's a compelling reason not to. We'd much rather build one solid brand rather than try to get many niche sites launched. Is it still possible to build landing pages for the niche/category and properly rank them organically? 

I ask this because I see a lot of talk lately about micro-niche sites. I can see the appeal of these for sure, but our business model involves having a broader offering. I'd like to ensure we aren't shooting ourselves in the foot by having a broader focus.",2,4,2013-12-01,ECOM,0.012156027369201183,0.8894557952880859,0.09838816523551941

shopify,Our lookup system no longer works,"A few weeks ago we noticed that our lookup system no longer worked on our shopify store. We're an auto parts manufacturer so having a year &gt; make &gt; model lookup is critical to our business. Shopify support explained that they recently made an unannounced change, and now our lookup only reviews the first 1000 parts, meaning the drop-down boxes no longer list all of the options and the whole thing is broken. The support rep indicated that this would be an easy enough fix for a dev to do, but I cannot find someone reputable to get it done. Anyone have experience with this or can point me to a resource?

The first product can be brought into America at $140 each LCL (in multiples of 27- $10 added due to shipping). The second must be brought in by container which costs $4k to ship and each would then be about $20 each freight cost.

Online retailers currently sell the item for the prices listed above with blanket $20 shipping fees.

Another easier option was to QRCODE a link to a custom landing page on the coupon and simply look at the landing pages visitor log. Mobile devices would invalidate any concrete results on this method. 

My client previously had no intention of using online resources for the Ad so a offline option would be more preferred.

ecommerce,Need help deciding on a platform,"Hi,

I currently work for a company with a strong web presence; producing ~£4mil a year revenue, all running through Magento. 

Come the new year, we'll (more than likely) be green lighted to re-platform, now this is where I am seeking help. I am quite a fan of Magento; whilst I acknowledge it can be an absolute pain in the arse - and has caused me no end of headaches and sleepless nights, I do not think there is a realistic contender out there for it's place in the market. It is stable, flexible, a solid 3rd party module market and can scale well (if done right).

Having said that, others within the company are keen to pursue other avenues - specifically rolling our own. The key projects for the new year are: integrating an ERP, entering multi currency and multi language markets, and potentially whitelabelling for other companies. In rolling our own, I see some long slogs ahead on integrations (payments gateways, ESPs etc) that for a more mature platform would alreayd have been built, tried, tested and on the market.

Knowing that Magento supports this out of the box, and having worked with it previously is a key plus for me.

I would really like to hear any other POVs on it, as I feel it would help me make a better informed decision. 

Thanks",9,2,2013-12-12,ECOM,0.010979419574141502,0.7988178133964539,0.1902027577161789

Basically, I'm thinking of opening a small, online, digital marketing agency with a focus on generating content for companies Facebook/Twitter/G+ pages.

I notice most small operations have real shoddy Facebook pages in particular. Horrible designs, badly photoshopped (MS paint?) images that they post, crude polls/competitions etc...

I might approach some websites like so:

Do up a small proposal document with some examples of my work, potential ideas for their sites etc... 

My service would cost a site €49.99 per 'pack'. 

A pack is:

1. Facebook page re-design
2. 5 relevant images for Facebook posts
3. Banner/avatar for Twitter
4. One Facebook poll/competition 
5. Mini-analytics report

Would you, as an ecommerce owner, take kindly to being coldly approached in such a manner? Or does my idea suck? 

Ps. I know I'll only end up making like €5 an hour. Maybe less. I'm broke, lost my job, need cash and am a full-time student. This stuff is kinda related to my degree so it could be a good experience. 

Thoughts?

ecommerce,I'd like to share my path and get any suggestions/advice from people who are further down the path than I.,"I started buying video games on craigslist and selling them on Amazon when I was 18. I would only buy games I could double my money off of. Made enough to pay for college (with the help of grants.) Went and got my degree. Graduated in January then in March I went back to selling online. I am now 24. Two months ago I started diversifying my inventory and have been selling those items on eBay. Link to store sales for Amazon and eBay: http://imgur.com/a/kT8Yu

  

I'm thankful for buying/selling video games because that's how I developed the lens through which I understand all business. It is also how I developed my infrastructure. By infrastructure I mean the solutions to questions any online retail business will have: how to store inventory, how to make each customer is happy and if they are not, how to make sure they contact me first w/o leaving negative feedback, what is the most effective shipping schedule, and the most effective shipping supplies and how to structure accounting statements. I developed a system that addresses all these issues very well and I thought that meant I had a real business on my hands.

Wrong. Used video games are not scalable. Without a brick and mortar store to do trade-in's I have no way of getting new inventory unless I go out and hunt for it. So after realizing what I have is really a pseudo business, I began to ask myself what a real business is. Seth Godin, in his start up school podcast, says a real business makes money and continues to function even when the owner is sleeping. And I think he's right. A pseudo-business crosses the threshold once it becomes self-sustainable. 

So, now that's what I'm after. I've seen on this subreddit (trolling motors and the hippie eCommerce store featured the other day) that building something like that online is entirely possible. I believe that my Amazon/eBay experience give me highly translatable skills but I also believe that there are huge gaps in my knowledge. Combined, these gaps probably make up the majority of the success of an eCommerce store.

1. HTML, CSS to the point where I can design a store
2. SEO and how to drive traffic
3. Knowledge of programs that cater to eCommerce stores i.e. shopify, Magento, etc.
4. Understanding and recognizing niches

Anyhow, thanks for listening. I give kudos to all of you who are trying to set up stores or who have stores already, especially those of you who are supporting yourselves through it. It takes a special kind of courage to leave the cushy office job and make the leap toward entrepreneurship.

I'll leave you with the quote that pushed me over the edge when I was debating entering the corporate world or going off on on my own. Undoubtedly, you all have read it and if it's banal by now I apologize.

Just wondering if any of you have had experience in having an eccomerce store designed?

Currently we use a fairly common theme. We are constantly getting great feedback on the design and I wouldn't want to change the overall look greatly, but there are some little things I would like to change/add to make the store more 'mine'. 

It is using WooCommerce and I would love to keep it if possible. However it seems Magento may have to be the way to go.. 

Would love to hear what you guys have done, who you used and roughly what it cost.

THANK YOU!","A year or so ago, /u/DropshipRedditor posted a AMA around his business. At the time this didn't register, but it stuck in the back of my mind. 

6 months ago, I decided to try setting up a business. I had no delusions that it would make me rich, but I thought it would be a really good learning experience. 

My site is www.caringcoffins.com. It's not the most feel-good business to have gone into, but the people I have met have all been beyond lovely. Every product we have sold so far has (touch wood) been delivered on time, without any flaws.

There are still things i'm not happy with about the site (my bounce rate is too high, I feel my call to actions could be better), but people trust the site enough to buy from us. 

Caring Coffins hasn't cost much in terms of start up expenses, but it has taken time, patience, and persistence. However the satisfaction of receiving our first was incredible. 

If anyone is thinking about giving it a go, I can't recommend it enough. Even if it doesn't work, you'll of learnt hugely important lessons. 

Next year I'm going to start another project. Again, I don't expect to get rich, but the more mud you throw...

This would also be separate from the payment processing itself (which I already use Stripe for).

ecommerce,Template use among different ecommerce engines.,"Hi all

Starting up an eCommerce site and I wanted to give a few a try (namely Volusion, Shopify, and maybe Magento Go). I want to purchase a template but I want it to be easily transferable between different engines and work with their tools (order management, content changes, payment transactions, etc) in case I end up switching. Doing a bit of research, it seems that certain solutions only favor templates built specifically for them.

Any help?

ecommerce,Need some advice on start-up website,"Hi all, need some advice.

I'm starting up a website dedicated to selling relatively cheap jewelry (about 200-300 products initially, then more later). I'm looking for 
some advice on how to go about it and what tools to use. I want the 
website to look very modern and easy to use (www.baublebar.com is a very good example at what I'm striving for). I'm looking for a good inexpensive way to begin this.

1. How should I design the website? Buy a template? Hire a designer?
2. Content management? Any recommendations on tools such as Drupal?
3. Shopping cart and transactions? Are tools such as Shopify a good way to go?
4. Order management and processing? How would I receive, process, and follow-up on orders?
5. Coupons, promotions, email marketing?

Basically, how would you go about this?

We're based out of Northern CA and produce and market a high quality, California-Produced Beef jerky. We launched about six months ago and have been doing well so far, though not growing as quickly as I have wanted. We've focused mostly on Northern CA retail distribution, as well as festivals, special events etc. 

One thing I feel I have neglected is really building the site up more than a simple placeholder/basic ecommerce site.

We were featured this morning on www.CoolMaterial.com and then picked up by www.Uncrate.com. This has led to our biggest day by far. Right now we're at 1292 visitors, 35 orders totalling a little over $1000. The most orders we've ever gotten in a day has been 8-10. 

http://imgur.com/mHz3Uoh

This is insane. We've never had this kind of traffic before. I honestly don't know what's the best way to leverage all these visits, orders and views. If anyone has any advice, suggestions, I would gladly take them.

Also please, any tips on our website, branding, logos, literally anything. It would all be greatly appreciated. Anything you like, dislike, be honest. My ego has been destroyed many times on the long journey of starting a business so I can take it, I swear. Also, sorry if this is rambling at all. Today has been crazy.

ecommerce,Look for some Reddit advice for e-commerce platform.,"Hey Reddit, 

I currently run a store using Volusion with less than 200 pages. I'm not a programmer and can make my way around, but more of an ecommerce marketer and business manager. I have a good understanding of SEO, marketing, customer design and user experience...

I'm looking for advice on a new project I'm starting. We have an item that is a higher ticket item for the recreation community - families and camping. Price tag is below 7k per unit. Once we gain traction I'd like to add to the store with complementing items and likely lower ticket items (above 100 but lower than 7k). 

I haven't messed with an e-commerce store using Wordpress - what's your take? What about an amazon hosted store site or google. 

I have started several wordpress sites and other sites on platforms such as homestead and google, not e-commerce. I've also had experience with the major players such as ebay, ebid, esty.

ecommerce,to stay or start with a new platform,"Dear Ecommerce Folk,

I'm a longtime Redditor and when I'm not wasting time here, I've had an online business, homepatterns, for several years. It has kept me busy, but now I'm ready to step it up a notch. However, I need a little help to know which way to proceed. Essentially, I design home plans and put them online. I am currently using Magento. My former developer has left the business and now the site is a bit broke on IE. So, first off, I need to get that repaired but I don't have any idea what is wrong with it. Anyone who wants to check it out and let me know what to look at can see a broken page/post [here](http://homepatterns.com/index.php/default/buckley.html) Thanks for any tips on how to get this fixed by a professional. 

I feel like the Magento website is slow and a bit more than I can handle. But I think it is not optimized as my developer was just learning it. I am not sure if I should keep it or not. Which leads me to my ultimate need - a new website. I don't need to reinvent the wheel. There are several websites by well know companies that I could emulate. I'd love to have their functionality with my current ""theme"" or look/feel.  These are my competitors: [eplans](http://www.eplans.com), [builderhouseplans](http://www.builderhouseplans.com/), [homeplans](http://www.homeplans.com/), and [houseplans.com](http://www.houseplans.com/) which is the most up to date, I think. What platform do they use? Is it possible to achieve something similar with Woo and WP? I was thinking of using this WP theme [estatement](http://estatement.bonsaished.com/) and customizing it to fit my needs. Search options are the most important aspect of my site and this theme is a nice fit in many ways. But I'm just not sure of the WP platform for what I want to achieve. I'm a small company willing to invest to get started but would rather not have a lot of running and updating costs.  With those precedents, what platform do you consider the best alternative? Stick with what I've got and improve it or start over with a better system? I would really appreciate any advice on upgrading my website, but there's also a real opportunity for work here, please PM me if you are interested.

ecommerce,I have a basic idea for an online business but have no idea which direction to go in.,"I am interested in starting an online shop selling cables to order. Ideally the customer would state the length they want, I would make the cables and then ship it out to them.

So far I have concluded I would have more luck flogging out of classifieds but I don't think that really counts as e-commerce.

Is starting off selling on ebay / amazon viable given that both websites aren't geared to selling custom items I am not sure it is.

I am sure there is a small niche that I can fill, I am yet to find someone doing this, the closest thing I have found is an American site selling in per-determined lengths.
