ecommerce,"I like fashion and accessories, but I can't actually make anything on a professional level. How would someone like me go about creating an ecommerce and act more as a ""buyer"" and choose the inventory the store sells, rather than actually making and selling stuff?","I pay attention to fashion trends (to an extent... some don't need the encouragement!) but I am very good at knowing what styles stick around and sell. I don't have a degree in merchandising, but I have been working under several retail companies (commercial as well as specialty) since 2008 and have seen what styles most customers appreciate and always come back to time and time again. Along with that, I also have the equivalent level of experience in customer service and sales on both a base and commission rate. Not that this experience replaces a degree, but I have seen first-hand what works and what doesn't, at least for the stores in the region I worked under (Florida).

Unfortunately, I don't know how to make the clothes I love. So, I just need a little guidance on how to start an ecommerce possibly acting as the buyer and/or head of customer service (preferably as a buyer) rather than a designer.

Thanks in advance! I really appreciate your opinions and your time. :)",0,2,2013-11-05,ECOM,0.020096637308597565,0.9084828495979309,0.07142051309347153

How does this normally work?

Also, on a related note, what steps do I need to take to become official?  For example, do I need a tax identification number? how much does that usually cost and do i need more than that?

ecommerce,"Would love the community's feedback: New Inventory, eCommerce, and Social Media Management Platform.","Hello eCommerce Redditors!

I’m with a young startup that was hoping you’d be interested in trying out our platform to see what you think/find bugs/ make suggestions etc.

Our site is Shopseen.com. The platform is free to use and is a one stop shop to manage your inventory and seamlessly push your products to ecommerce sites (Shopify, Etsy, Storenvy etc.) and social media sites (Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr….you get the idea). Our goal is to be your main platform to manage inventory and sell/promote your work.

Any and all feedback would be much appreciated. I have been a long time lurker to reddit so this is somewhat new to me. We'd love hear your thoughts on things: like how the platform looks, how it compares to others in the space, what you would like to see out of a platform like this. Thanks!

ecommerce,Is this a copyright infringement?,"I am thinking of creating a product similar to one that is already in existence. 

Basically, I hope to create a poster that has 1000-1500 Chinese characters. The poster I am referring to has 1500 Chinese characters that is in order of use. The Chinese government released a list of the most popular characters, and this business has utilized that list. 

So what I would like to do would be to create a poster that is similar, but maybe with 1000 characters. Given that the list of characters, and order is not from the creators of the poster, but rather the Chinese government. Would this be a copyright infringement? 

A similar question: 

Could I create a poster similar to theirs, and at what point would it be a copyright infringement?

You see, I believe they have a great product, but their business model is subpar, and I'd like to compete with them. Any advice is appreciated!",2,2,2013-11-20,ECOM,0.04226988926529884,0.9286304116249084,0.02909972332417965

ecommerce,"ecommerce ""feeder"" site drives sales to my main website. ~20 pages of product info, each with a link pointing to the main site's product page. Leave it as-is or convert it into a standalone site with ecommerce integration? Or leave as-is and launch on a different domain?","I'm worried about sabotaging the referral sales I'm already getting on my main site through this domain, but at the same time I feel like I'm losing out on conversions from people who are consciously annoyed at being directed to a different site for purchase, or those who are generally just too confused by the redirect and interruption in the regular process flow.

It's probably apparent that I'm leaning towards converting the secondary domain into a standalone ecommerce site. I'm worried though that I could be missing part of the equation here, and I might end up with less direct sales on the site if i were to convert. And maybe if I had left it the same, the amount of referral sales I'd be getting would outweigh the potential sales from converting to standalone.

Another consideration, this whole dilemma is predicated on the notion that this certain domain will carry some kind of power. The domain ranks well for related search terms, and drives a fair amount of referral conversions (sales).

I plan to switch the site from it's current architecture of a 960 grid with vanilla html and cass, to a site powered by WordPress and WooCommerce. I freelance to pay the bills, and most of my work is stuff just like this, but usually I'm integrating a shopping cart into an existing site that was previously doing no commerce, or improving an existing ecommerce website that was already standalone.  

Will switching the architecture of the site so drastically impact it's rankings on Google? I believe the domains greatest strength at this point is its high native listings, which drive referral traffic to my main website. Am I going to lose this native listing if I switch the site's architecture?  

Would I be better off launching this website on a new domain with no previous rankings or anything to risk?

* I have a main ecommerce website.  
* I have a second domain with ~20 pages of product information.  
* The second domain ranks well in Google native search.  
* Product pages on the second domain have links pointing to the product pages of my main domain, driving referral sales.
* I think I would get more conversions if the checkout process were integrated with the second domain.
* I think people might drop off when they are redirected to the site, either consciously because the practice annoys them, or simply because they are confused.
* Will I tank the domains native rankings if I change the architecture?
* Am I better off launching the new ecommerce site on some new random domain?
* Am I about to make a huge mistake?!",3,1,2013-11-20,ECOM,0.2680772840976715,0.7076334357261658,0.02428927831351757

ecommerce,Sales are Good but no where near 08 pre-crash levels. Need Critique!,"I posted a few months back. Figured I'd follow up with a another update.

Our main traffic and sales come from Winches and Jeep Soft Tops.

http://www.clemson4wheel.com/shop-by-brand/warn.html

http://www.clemson4wheel.com/shop-by-brand/bestop.html

Guaranteed 30 + hits of direct traffic to each one of these categories from the product manufacturers a day. These are pretty high dollar sales with the average sale being close to $1,000.

The first link, Warn - Has a 2.5% conversion rate while the Bestop link has less than a 1% conversion rate. I would like to have a 4% + conversion rate which Ive read is optimal for high-mid range priced products. The drop off rate for these pages is around 30% with the bounce rates being around 15% on WARN and around 20% on Bestop.

The layered navigation was getting a bit cumbersome on the WARN landing page so as you can see I'm doing an experiment with the side bar navigation on that category to try and improve page views and conversions. I had the feeling customers were overwhelmed with our sorting options.

Ive got 75% of the products tagged with Titles and Meta Descriptions. 98% of all 3,000 products have good product descriptions and multiple images where it applies.

Ive added custom ""help"" type content with high destiny keywords - you can see on the right col menu on the WARN landing page labeled as ""Warn Resources"".

The site still has a few CSS bugs that I need to fix but a lot of the pages have very minimum w3 validation errors.

Over the last months Ive seen our impressions drop 10% only to spike back up to our normal levels this past week.. Our clicks from targetted keywords are ZERO. Yes, ZERO.

Despite hours and hours of on-page SEO my efforts have yet to pay off. All of our search engine links are direct searches for our shop/site.

Our social presence has spiked to an all time high with 2,000+ page likes. Facebook accounts for our 3rd highest incoming source of traffic behind the direct manufacturers links. Unfortunately I cant say this has resulted in a increase in sales.

I have plans to redesign the category splash images on the home page soon to try and reduce drop off rates from the home page. Something simple and clean either displaying categories or both products and categories. As it stands now our site wide bounce rate is hovering at 40 %.

What do you think? At this point Im leaning towards optimizing and improving our current revenue makers while still trying to get Google keyword traffic. I'm kind of in a slump tho - Not really sure what I should prioritize or focus on next.

Opinions? Recommendations? Design Tips?

ecommerce,'Affiliate Coupon' plug-ins?,"eCommerce newb, I had an idea for a site in which people could help me promote my products in their videos/on their own site.  

I would assign them a coupon code that belongs to them.  Once a costumer decides they want to purchase something from my site they would enter in their coupon code at the checkout and a portion of that sale would automatically get credited to the owner of that code.

Are there any WordPress plug-ins that would allow this?  Could Shopify accomplish this, some other platform?  If not, what platform would you suggest that might be best to develop this capability for?

ecommerce,eCommerce Marketing Recipes,"I'm testing an idea for a project and wanted to see if anyone here would be interested.

I see a lot of ecommerce site owners getting overwhelmed with the amount of digital marketing advice on how to grow their business, so I'm creating a membership site that offers proven strategies and tactics and guides you through them step-by-step. These marketing ""recipes"" will tell you what resources you need and exactly what to do to implement.

These recipes would come in both video and text format but I'm open to other mediums too :). 

If you're wondering who I am to create such a resource: I've helped a bunch of businesses from various industries create great marketing systems over the last 5 years, including several ecommerce sites. It's an industry I'm quite passionate about, and figured this would be a great way to serve it.

Initial idea for pricing is $39 a month.

Who's interested? 

Open to any and all feedback :).

Thanks in advance,

- Tom",4,1,2013-11-28,ECOM,0.018370119854807854,0.9101464748382568,0.07148343324661255
ecommerce,A Better Way to Ship Products,"I have an idea for an ecommerce site. The products I'll be selling have a good margin but the cost of S&amp;H make it uncompetitive with existing retail prices. Simply put, nobody in their right mind would buy these products on my store even though they're cheaper than traditional retail - because S&amp;H eats any savings. 

However - my problems are caused by bulky retail packaging. 

Do you think it's a good idea to remove items from their packaging for cheap (way cheaper) S&amp;H. I was thinking I could offer the customer two choices (packaging or no packaging) so there are no concerns that I'm selling knock-off merchandise. 

Thoughts? 

Would you mind not getting original packaging if you were saving money?",11,6,2013-11-29,ECOM,0.03638728708028793,0.9053491950035095,0.05826355889439583
