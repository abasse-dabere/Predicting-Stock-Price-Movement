I'm looking for a multichannel e-commerce solution for listing at the moment 250'000 items and increasing to several European Amazon, ebay, Rakuten platforms and for the own webshop (which is also in planning - Prestashop, Magento and Shopware are considerated at the moment). Automated stock sync is desireabled but not a must have, because of the daily based update. 

Some requirements: Amazon repricer and a permant blocking of several barcodes (which can still be included on the daily stock lists but should not get uploaded).

I've already taken a look at Linnworks, but they don't support 250k items for the Amazon repricer. Another possibility is Neteven, but there is no possibility for them to block barcodes, and I'm not sure about the price of 2.5% of every sold article through marketplaces (no provision on sells on the own webshop). 4Sellers is for the beginning with five- to six-digited investment too expensive.

I would gladly hear all suggestions, even if they do not completely match my needs.

shopify,Checkout App for my surprise gift website,"I'm working on developing my surprise gift website right now. In essence the site sends customers a mystery gift right to their door for either $10 or $20.

Upon checkout the customer will see a pop-up window that will allow them to pick what mystery gift the next customer will receive (out of 3 items from a bank of about 40 total).
Then another pop-up window will appear offering the customer the option of adding any of the previous 3 items to their cart for a discounted rate. 

So what I need the App to do is:
1) make the 1st pop-up window appear 
2) populate it with 3 gifts chosen at random from the bank of 40
3) Store the customers choice and add it to the next customers order
4) Offer the customer the option of adding any of the 3 items to their own cart

I know there are services out there such as https://www.shopgate.com/uk which will do this for you, however it is on a subscription and transaction fee modeil so I was hoping that a cheaper solution exists without having to design a mobile site from the ground up.

ecommerce,I've got a &lt; 2 minute multiple choice ecommerce test up and would LOVE some feedback!,"Hi everyone!

*First things first, if this is in any way against the sub's rules or otherwise uncool please downvote to oblivion. I don't want to be ""that guy""*

So here at my job we create and distribute multiple choice quizzes that assess various user skills in &lt; 2 minutes, and we really want to make our tests as balln' as humanly possible.

We start off writing our tests with a few experts or professionals in a skill and then build them up with questions submitted by our users themselves. This gives our tests awesome agility, range, and flexibility, but also opens the doors to a little misinformation.

With that in mind I'd be beyond appreciative if some people from /r/ecommerce would take a few minutes to quickly run through the test and answer a few questions to make sure the quality is up to snuff.

Even just taking the test will help us figure out what questions are too hard or too easy, but if you'd like to go above &amp; beyond you can leave a comment explaining exactly what you feel about a specific question.

&gt; If you're interested the test can be found here: http://smarterer.com/tests/ecommerce?ref=snuecom

**DISCLAIMER**: You DO have to sign up for the website with an email or social media account, but I promise we don't send off any spam. Honestly, if you see any sort of email you don't want I'd be happy to take care of it myself (joe@smarterer.com) I know can often be a deal breaker, so I won't be offended if you're not into signing up.

Again I'd be super appreciative of any help, but only if you'd like to give it.

Thanks! 

-- Joe

*PS: Via my post history you might notice that I have some similarly worded threads up in other subs. I promise that I really do treat each post individually... it's just that they're basically the same idea, and the ol' copy/paste is a bit more efficient than trying to think up unique ways to express the same message each time.

I'm not really sure what this means or how to go about it. I tried creating an import shipment via UPS, but it came out to about $80 for a tiny package. The contents are only worth a few bucks. Can anybody clear this part of the process up for me?

I figured there might be some providers that offer a backend where you can define products, categories, paytment methods, discounts and stuff in a back-end that they provide, and that let you build your own front-end in any language or platform you wish, using API calls to tap into the back-end.

ecommerce,Help me setup an ecommerce website so I can sell my magic cards to pay for my heart transplant,"Hello,

I'm trying to raise money for my heart transplant and I've been selling magic cards that I win or trade for a profit.  I'm pretty good at magic the gathering and I win a lot of cards.  So I sell them to pay my medical bills.  Well I would like to do this full-time.

Right now I'm selling on ebay/tcgplayer have cut into a lot of my profits.  About 11% in fees.  This week alone it's cost me at least $25 in fees for my $170 in sales. I sell about $500-600 a month.  I realize hosting will cost me money, and SSL will cost me money to accept credit cards.  Along with the 3% fees+.40 per transaction.  

I was thinking of getting a godaddy hosting so I can sell cards through wordpress.  I don't need SSL really as long as I can accept paypal.  I believe they take 4%+.3 per transaction.  And I can easily print postage through them to the people buying my cards.

I called Godaddy and they'll do hosting+domain for $72 a year.  Right now, I'm mainly selling on facebook and some websites to people just through paypal alone.  So having this website would make it easier and I think it would make people feel safer than buying off a guy on facebook.  Plus I can maybe give people a 5% coupon code for a first time purchase.  

Here's a facebook shop I have going right now to my shopify account.  I think you need a password to view the product though since its just a trial account.
https://www.facebook.com/alphabeastgames/app_410312912374011

Tell me what you guys think.  This is the website I made to help raise money for my heart transplant.  I know it sucks, but I can't do much else.

ecommerce,"""Seems like a bunch of e-commerce business would find this useful."" - Hiten Shah","Hey /r/ecommerce- I just wanted to post this here to see if I could help get some feedback on a business idea I am building.

I made that the title, because it was a real piece of feedback from someone I know lots of people respect, Hiten Shah.

The idea is fairly simple: help you convert more of your traffic.

How? 

-By using geolocation technology to identify where your users are located (generally), and then displaying them a popup if they are located within a certain radius.

The first time I tried to launch, I could not get people to effectively test the tool.

Since then: ~600 hits, 27 beta users, only 9 treats were made, and only 1 person even tested it out. No one has even logged in a second time.

Ouch. I was really hoping to get some more testers. But instead of trying to force people down a product that isn't right, I want to focus on the feedback I got.
The biggest complaints were:
-The opt-in process sucks. Most users will opt out.
-Too unclear about what it was actually for.

I have reworked the technology, and tried to hone the marketing messaging.
I recorded another (very short) video that demonstrates the update here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn5Q5BOTrBU

If you want to see a live demo (and you are within the USA), just goto the home page http://GeoTreat.com. You should see a popup.

That is why I am here, /r/ecommerce. I am seeking feedback, and ideally test users.

dropship,Is it worth it to hire a web developer as a business partner or freelancer to create a dropshipping company?,"I'm making the business plan for this dropshipping company I want to start in several months right now and I want a little advice for creating the actual online store. Without boring you with all the details, I'm trying to make a global disability equality awareness brand.

So I want to create it using Shopify and Ecommhub (with several other services). I really want to create this with a web developer to hire as a business partner. I'm slowly teaching myself coding, web design, and computer science myself, but I don't think it would be efficient for me to run/continually evolve the website and tech end. I have a pretty rough disability (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) so there's no way I could physically do it all myself too.

I'm going to be looking for a web developer through Meetup.com and networking. I'm located near Boston so it shouldn't be too hard considering all the amazing schools around here.

Do you all think it's worthwhile for me to find one as a business partner? I'm looking to pay them equity AND cash (cash for the creation of it, each hour of coding they'll do after its built, and for each completed project). I want them to help me build it, continually evolve it, create an affiliate program, maybe create an app, help me use API's, and several other things.

Should I just look to hire a freelancer to create my shopify site and hire a web developer to join my team after? I know there's many talented Shopify freelancers on Shopify's site, elance, and any of the freelancing sites. I know they're expensive but my site will be the heart of my business and I want it to be beautiful and efficient.

ecommerce,Need help from the experts! Can anyone answer a few questions about PCI and PA-DSS Compliance?,"Hey /r/ecommerce!


I’m a sr. account executive trying to understand PCI compliance and PA-DSS compliance and I feel like I’ve gotten in over my head. I just need help with a few answers from people who know more about this- so thank you in advance for reading!

The client my company is working with is building an ecommerce platform using Magento Community Edition. They are classified as a level 4 merchant with less than 20,000 transactions per year. For payment processing, they have an account through First Data. We're using a Magento extension with an API connection to First Data's Global Gateway e4 Web Service to process all CC payments.  http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/magento-firstdata-api-payment-module-originally-linkpoint.html

During the check-out, a user enters their information through Magento's front-end page, and once they hit 'purchase' the information is sent through an encrypted SSL connection to First Data for payment processing.

So I have a few questions on how we can help our client pass compliance testing and ensure our systems are up to the industry standards for a level 4 merchant.

* As a level 4 merchant, do we need to be PCI compliant?
* What kind of security do we need to put in place to pass compliance testing?
* What is the difference between PCI compliance and PA-DSS compliance?
* As a level 4 merchant, does Magento and the API extension need to be PA-DSS compliant?
* How do other merchants get approved using the Magento Community Edition?

Thank you so much if you can offer any insight!
