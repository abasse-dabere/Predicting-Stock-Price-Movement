dropship,Are there any Japanese dropship companies?,"I'm interested in dropshipping goods from Japan, like toys, video games, and especially electronics, worldwide but so far I've only found 2 companies that dropship stuff from Japan, neither of which has what I'm looking for.

I was hoping to find something similar to AliExpress, but haven't yet. 

Could anyone point me in the right direction?

edit: I thought I'd add the list of companies that I've found, just for research purposes. Please note that I haven't done business with any of these companies and can't really vouch for their reliability. Taken from the post below:

&gt;As for the companies I've found, first there's goodsfromjapan.com (https://goodsfromjapan.com/). It seems like they sell novelties more than anything.

&gt;Then there's Yunomi (https://yunomi.life/products/dropship). They do private label matcha dropshipping for a fee. Not a bad product, but I'm not looking to dropship foodstuffs right now.

dropship,Canadian selling in $US headaches,"My shopify stores is making some $$ which im thrilled about.... but

There's a clusterfuck of issues because I'm a Canadian selling in  $US.  I want to set up an account or method where one bank account can be used to receive payouts and also spend from it to fulfill orders. Please advise guys!!

More context: shopify payouts falied to go into Canadian bank account, suspected reason is because it's USD going into CDN account. So I opened up a joint $US account with my partner (account is still with canadian bank) Will see if this is a fix in a couple of days when next payout is scheduled.

Also I want to use this account not only to recieve payment but also to fulfill orders but the bank tells me that's not possible.

ecommerce,My first business closed it's first year at $165k in sales. We only used Instagram for marketing and spent less than $1k on ads. Here are a few things I learned.,"In no particular order, here are a few things that helped contribute to a successful first year.

INSTAGRAM RELATED...

1.  [Assuming your target audience is under 35] Live on Instagram. Don't just post though- follow people/business you truly enjoy and interact with them genuinely, as another human.

2.  Play it straight and don't buy followers or likes. The goal is to attract potential customers, obviously bots and paid followers aren't going to be buying. And it's not worth the appearance of success. As a consumer, it's easy to spot fake interaction which can damage your brand. Don't stress over the amount of followers you have (we only have 15k, but they are 100% real. Grow organically.

3.  In addition to #2, don't out kick your coverage in terms of the number of people you follow. If you don't have time to interact with your whole feed, don't follow thousands of people in hopes that they'll follow you back. Again, it will damage your brand.

4.  Collaborate with other companies with the same target market. It will help pull in real followers.

5.  The algorithm is your friend. There isn't some wizard formula to showing up in people's feeds. Be active in it and stay up on interaction, post regularly, respond to DM's, watch stories, etc. Instagram itself is a business after all, they just want you using their product. Don't take shortcuts.

6.  Use the business analytics in the app, they are solid gold for learning who your demographic is, what days/hours your followers are most active, top posts, etc.

7.  Don't be afraid to be personal. Share videos of yourself talking on your stories and using the product in your day to day life. We share photos of our kids helping pack orders, people love small businesses.

8.  Giveaways will generate many followers, but don't do them too often. My opinion is no more than 8-10 times a year.

9.  Involve them in making decisions. This was an amazing strategy we used. Ex 1: ""Help us name the next product and if we use your suggestion we'll send you one for free!"" Your customers might have more good ideas than you might anticipate. Ex 2: Polling two potential product options on a story. Get them invested in the development.

10.  Get in and interact in that explore feed, it's a surefire way to reach potential customers without being spammy.


GENERAL BUSINESS PRACTICES...

1.  Free shipping or death. Build it into the price if you have to. People hate paying for shipping. Also don't skimp on the service. Be on par with Amazon if possible. We ship everything USPS Priority which is extremely fast (1-3 days across the entire US / 7-9 internationally)

2.  Have a generous return/exchange policy. The cost of losing potential sales outweighs the cost of returns/shipping cost.

3.  Out of stock is a good thing. Sure it can suck to decrease sales, but IMO it's heavily outweighed by the benefits of having a more exclusive product. On-the-fencers won't be on-the-fence anymore.

4.  Rarely do sales! They are like a drug because it's such good short term success, but you and your customers will become dependent on them, which will damage the brand and obviously the margins. If possible- treat your prices like Apple does.

Here's the spreadsheet that owns my life.,"I've been the ecommerce manager at an international sporting goods company for the past 6 months. I put together this spreadsheet in my first few weeks when I saw my goals going into Q4.... they were astronomical but I knew the only way forward was to let the data decide. Don't freak out. Let the data drive, always.

[The attached spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1924OclRQhW3vETjCVJ14DPaJL6bLmgf9Dzq3iwd8xxY/edit?usp=sharing) has all of my numbers removed and a bunch of place holders.

*shameless self promotion, this thing has helped me project sales to within 5-8k months in advance. It's safe to say our controller loves me because she knows she can always count on my cash-flow projections! 

TLDR - Simple spreadsheet I use every day to project sales, set goals and forecast revenue. Simple, and with good GA numbers, this is really all you need.

shopify,Looking to help two store owners optimize their page speed.,"I am working on an in-depth guide that will educate Shopify store owners on how to optimize their page load times. These load times can have a direct impact on your conversion rates and per Google - are likely to have an impact on your organic search ranking as well. 

You can check your Google PageSpeed here: [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

**What I Offer**

I will help two Shopify store owners get as close to a perfect score on Google and Yahoo's page speed tools as possible. This will improve your page load times and potentially your conversion rates. 

*Note: I need your help because I need average store owners following my directions to ensure that they are not only accurate but easy to read and follow. I will not be performing the work of optimizing but instead only providing consultation as to how (in detail).

**What I Require**

Both store owners will need the time and commitment to follow-through with the entire process. I wish I could give you a time-frame and or quantify the workload but this varies greatly by how your theme is structured. 

**What's the Catch?**

None, honestly... I believe in publishing quality content and that means knowing that my readers can not only read it but can follow it without issue. The best way for me to vet the information is to have people do it and provide feedback. 

**Finally**

As much as I would love to help everyone I will only be able to help 1 or 2 store owners at most. To qualify you need to run your home page and a product page through the tool above and let me know the scores (desktop and mobile) for each in response to this post. 

Of course, once the guide is 100% finished I would be more than happy to post it here for everyone else to take advantage of as well.

*Note: This is not likely to be a five minute process, you need to be committed to doing what's necessary to improve your store. This is very likely to require you to put in a few hours of work, if this is not something that you're prepared for then please do not bother submitting your website for consideration. *",3,3,2018-01-03,ECOM,0.022390039637684822,0.9305623173713684,0.04704765975475311

ecommerce,"1.8% Higher Conversions on My Webstore, Just By Using a Different Finance Company","If you’ve ever wondered if you should add financing to your ecommerce store, as an option for people who may want to buy your products, but perhaps are having a hard time coming up with the cash up front, I’d like to strongly advise you to go ahead and make the move. Especially if you sell big-ticket items, like furniture, appliances, etc.

When you offer financing, it can heavily influence your customer’s decision to buy. And not surprisingly, it can also lead to bigger purchases as well. 
 
I’ve been offering financing on my website for a few years now, and I can say with confidence that it's been a key driver of new sales. It can be a great way to gain a whole new segment of customers that you wouldn’t otherwise have –those who want to buy, but aren’t able to plunk down all of the cash up front. 

Of course, before you rush out and add just any old financing option to your website, I’d like to caution you to take the time to research your options before you commit. It’s worth spending some time looking into what’s out there, since the company that you choose to go with could have an impact your conversion rates. It’s also good to make sure that you’re going with a trustworthy company. Your reputation’s on the line and if your customers have a bad experience, you can be sure that it’s going to reflect badly on you.
 
For me personally, I’ve found that there’s a big difference between financing companies.
 
So when I first started offering financing, I used Community Finance, and then Affirm. They were both decent options, but when I made the switch to Bread I noticed a real difference in conversions. It seems Bread really has it together in the marketing dept. and have optimized their process for ecommerce stores –and that, it turns out is a key driver of conversions. We were getting about 1.4% conversions with Affirm, but with Bread it’s in the 3.2% range.
 
I’m not affiliated with Bread in any way (aside from using them myself) but I thought I’d mention my experience to encourage you to track your conversions, so you can find out for yourself which company works best for you.
 
If you’re thinking about offering financing, I’ll quickly give you a few tips for finding a company that’s a good fit for your business.
 
First, talk to multiple companies, since they all seem to focus on different niches and have different risk tolerances. You'll want to find one that specializes in your industry, for best results. They’ll know how to reach your customers, and will know the ins and outs associated with the business as well.
 
Next, make sure they can provide real time approval versus delayed approval. This is key since the longer a customer has to wait, the less likely they'll be to go through with their purchase. 
 
Also, ideally you’ll want to find an option that will allow the customer to stay on your site versus going to their site. Nothing worse than sending your customers on a wild goose chase. Keep them on-site!
 
Costs. You’ll also want to ask about their costs. Will you get paid in full upfront? Do you pay a monthly fee, or will you have to pay a percentage for each transaction? A monthly fee is often better, especially if you’re making more than a few sales a month.
 
Flexibility. What’s their APR structure like? Are they willing to compromise on that? Don’t insult your customers by going with someone that’s going to charge a 160% APR, it’s just not worth it.

Do they integrate with your website design? You don’t want a huge flashy logo promoting the financing company. Bread, for example, really integrates well. They can offer financing to customers at any stage in the sales journey, which is helpful. So, for example, they can show customers that they could get that new couch for just $89 per month; instead of $1500 up front. Bread also gives you a lot of control over the messaging, and aesthetics of the financing options; so you can customize it to make sure it’s in line with your website’s colors and design. They also let you customize the loan terms as well.

ecommerce,Bootstrapped from $30 investment to over $100k/mo e-commerce brand in just six years.,"Hi /r/Entrepreneur, it's Pat from Starter Story, where I do interviews with successful e-commerce entrepreneurs on how they got started.

Here is my interview with Eric Bandholz, the founder of Beardbrand, the wildly successful men's grooming brand and e-commerce store. Hope you enjoy. :)

### Background.

I’m Eric Bandholz, the founder of Beardbrand. Beardbrand is a men’s grooming company that makes products for your beard, hair, and body. In addition to that, we also create a significant amount of content on our YouTube channel.

I serve as the Creative Director and make sure that the brand stays true to our original vision and is communicated appropriately.

We’ve bootstrapped the business from a $30 investment to seven figures in a short period of time. We’ve been expanding our product offerings with the goal of getting towards that 8 figure mark.

### How I came up with the idea.

Before starting Beardbrand, I was a financial advisor at a big bank. I felt the corporate pressures to look and behave a certain way and it was too much for me. So I left that career, grew out my beard and started a graphic design business.

As I rocked a beard in the business world, I heard a lot of typical bearded stereotypes - Grizzly Adams, ZZ Top, and Duck Dynasty. While those are interesting people, they weren’t lifestyles that I personally identified with.

It was after attending an event with other bearded individuals similar to me that I realized there was an entirely new group of beardsmen. I coined the term “urban beardsman” to describe myself and people similar to me. An urban beardsman is a typical dude who doesn’t fit the traditional stereotypes that come with a beard.

Beardbrand was created to unite urban beardsmen and give them the tools they needed to feel confident about being themselves. That meant creating a lot of content (blog posts, videos, and talking on podcasts).

At first, we started with regular posts on Tumblr because that was the easiest platform to generate a bulk amount of content quickly. In addition to that, I wrote a few blog posts and created a few YouTube videos, but it was a very modest community. I think we had 300 YouTube subscribers after 12 months and only a hundred daily visitors to our blog.

After about a year of creating content, we launched an e-commerce store to sell men’s grooming products and it’s been a grind ever since. Gradually, I reduced my commitment to my graphic design business and put those efforts into Beardbrand as it got traction.

### The process of starting Beardbrand.

We launched the Beardbrand e-commerce store a few days before I found out that my wife was pregnant with our first child. That gave me a tight deadline to grow Beardbrand to the point it could support our family or else I’d have to go back to the corporate world.

In those very early days of Beardbrand, there was a bit of luck on our side. First, we were pretty much the only organization that took growing beards seriously (today everyone and their mom talks about beards &amp; beard care). Because of that, it was easy for us to get noticed.

In November of 2012, I was contacted by a reporter from the New York Times who was doing a piece on beards. I told my co-founders about it and suggested that we take advantage of the publicity and try to sell some products on an e-commerce store. It was at that moment that we decided to monetize the brand.

We started our store by carrying a different brand’s products. I was familiar with a small beard oil &amp; mustache wax manufacturer (think Etsy level business). So I reached out to that person and asked if we could resell their products at standard wholesale prices. He agreed, and we added two types of beard oil and one mustache wax available for purchase on our website. I believe the initial order was about $100 worth of products.

For the platform, we decided to go with Shopify and built the website with one of their free templates. I used the photography from our manufacturer and wrote the copy myself. Because I was a graphic designer, I was able to build the website in about two days. We launched on January 28th, 2013, just two days before the New York Times article went live. I made a post on Facebook, and ironically the first customer of Beardbrand was also my first customer of my graphic design business.

Then the New York Times article was published, which ended up driving about $515 worth of sales over the next seven days and gave me the motivation to grow and expand the business. In these early days, I was fulfilling the products myself and running them to the post office. Eventually, we partnered up with a fulfillment house so that we could focus on our marketing efforts.

We are a truly bootstrapped company - no outside money, no bank loans, no debt. My co-founders purchased their shares of the company as we launched and we rolled any profits back into the business. We didn’t pull any cash out of the business for the first ten months, and then after that, it was a very modest salary.

I’m fortunate to live a modest lifestyle, and my wife has a job that could support both of us. Without that, our story might be completely different.

We were lucky to be the company to build a new industry - beard care. As the market leader, we were able to parlay that into copious amounts of PR which helped accelerate our growth. Our early wins were that NY Times article, but also we were included in some best beard oils articles that included our products. Those other articles ended up ranking well on Google and drove a good part of our business.

Those articles were great, but our most significant PR event was appearing on Shark Tank on Halloween of 2014. The exposure from being on Prime Time TV is like none other. If you want to see what that did for our business, check out the write up I did over on Reddit.

We’ve continued to have a lean mentality with our product launches and offering. We create small initial batch runs and modify our products based on the feedback from our customers. This minimizes risk and allows us to continue to grow as a bootstrapped company.

It was about 7 or 8 months in that I felt the business had potential to support me and my family. We were doing about $25k/month at that time, but still not pulling anything out of the business. I’ve always thought Beardbrand has had potential to do 9 figures, so we are grinding away trying to figure out how to do that.

### Attracting new customers and growing.

Our top priority for getting in front of new customers is through content creation. Currently, we are publishing one YouTube video per day, along with a matching blog post. YouTube has been an excellent platform for us. It’s really the only social media channel that still has insane organic reach. The other nice thing about YouTube is that it’s really hard to do well, so it keeps away a lot of competitors.

YouTube is always changing the algorithm so it’s important to understand their motives and create content that falls in line with what they want to share. As of this writing, that means content that grows user's watch time and is advertiser-friendly. You have to be prepared to change your strategy based on the platform.

Once we get them to our website we then try to drive them into our Beardsman Quiz funnel which allows us to capture their email and get them in our email flow.

We’ve always had a preference for owning our audience as much as possible. That means creating our own content and collecting email addresses. I think it’s a longer and slower way to grow, but leads to a more stable business model.

After people visit our website, we will also remarket to them using Google Adwords and Facebook. Currently, we don’t have a channel that makes up a majority of our sales. This is a blessing and a curse. I think it helps level out our sales, but it prevents us from growing exponentially if we were exceptional at one of our channels.

### What would I do differently if I could go back?

One of the internal themes we rolled out for 2017 was “focus” and I think that’s something that I wish we implemented earlier in our strategy. We tried to do too much too quickly, and it spread us pretty thin. With our internal push for ""focus"", it meant the team could look at the things we did well, and figure out ways to improve it. Before, we were just trying to identify how to grow as quickly as possible. Now, we are able to improve profitability, inventory management, marketing tactics, product development, and project management. There’s still room to improve, so that’s why we’ll continue to keep that them going.

Our other big mistake was not committing to a hiring process and our reluctance to come to terms with being a business manager, rather than just a founder. A small team of 4 or 5 is easy to manage as everyone understands what to do, but when you get above that, communication becomes harder. If you don’t have the right people in place, everything slows down.

We follow the topgrading hiring strategy, and we’ve found it really helps us find the right team members for the company. I wish we started off with that from day one.

### Competition.

You know, I can’t really control our competitors. If they are infringing on our trademarks and copyrights, we’ll have our legal team go after them, but otherwise, we focus on our customers and how we can make their experience even better.

We’ve had a countless number of copycats, and last I checked there were 1500+ beard care companies. We simply try to do things that are 10x better than what anyone else can do. It’s why we are pushing a video a day, blog posts all the time, and world-class customer service. Amazon will never be able to touch us with what we provide to our customers, and very few will be able to integrate handsome design, excellent customer service, and a bustling community for their customers.

### Plans for the future.

We like being independent as it allows us to focus on our customers and what’s best for them - rather than paying off debt or getting returns for investors. Personally, I love Beardbrand and being part of it. It would be fun to grow it to a point that I’m truly out of the day to day and can focus exclusively on the vision. We are still a few key hires away from that point.

Our strategy now is to get better at what we are currently doing. We’ll be integrating more analytical based decision-making processes as well as expanding our product offering. There’s a bunch of products I want to roll out to feel like we have a full line of men’s grooming products. In addition, I want to build the company to be thought of as a men’s grooming company rather than just a beard care company. That’s going to be a big hurdle, but I think we can get there.

Right now things are pretty good for me and we’ve got a really good team in place. We still struggle with selling quicker than we expected, but that’s a good problem. My other big project is to find a marketing channel that allows us to scale our business significantly. We’ve tested a lot of channels, but none are delivering the results I want.

### Tools I use.

We are big fans of Shopify and are a Shopify Plus customer. That being said, I was a little annoyed when they jacked the price up significantly. Even at the higher rate, I think they bring a significant amount of value to the business. If they continue to raise prices, we’ll have to re-evaluate that decision.

Our email flows are built on Klaviyo and they are serviceable. They’ve been making some nice progress with their platform over the past couple months in terms of design and speed. Email marketing is a big part of our business.

Speaking of email and website, one of our trusted vendors is Fuel Made and they designed our website, as well as set up our email flows. They are great at hitting timelines and delivering on what we ask. That being said, we do design mockups in-house and send it over to them; which will help with the production process.

Reviews are crucial to the success of an online business and we are currently using YotPo. Like Shopify, they’ve jacked their prices up over the years which is a little bit frustrating, but right now it’s serviceable.

ecommerce,Should I hire marketing experts + how scalable is it?,"I am at the moment selling on Ebay, Amazon and a few other platforms selling small leather goods in the UK. I am in the process of setting up my website. Turnover currently is $8000/month with just the marketplaces.

I had 2 thoughts, maybe it’s naïve to think this way but I would like some thoughts/nuances.

Thought 1:

To get traffic and sales on the website, I will need to do marketing. Now I am no marketing expert at all, I have some very basic knowledge of the different PPC’s. However, I am not confident I can pull of the marketing by myself.

Sure, I can learn Google Adwords, Social media marketing, Media buy (banner advertising), Google Display Network, Google Shopping, Email marketing, Bing ads, etc. I realize that it will take me ages to learn all of it (after that period I am not even sure if I will be an ‘expert’ at it, most probably not).

So I was thinking hiring marketing experts for the following 2 reasons:

1) They are the experts, they are in this industry and they work day in day out with paid advertising, they know what they are doing
2) I will lose a lot of money by trying, tweaking, optimizing, and eventually after 6 months I will realize I just can’t do it because I am no expert


Thought 2:

Is it scalable? 

Let’s say I hire an expert in 1 field (Google Adwords for instance). As an example I start off with $500 and after a few months of testing, tweaking and optimizing, the expert gets me a good ROI and gets me $2500 every month after that (times 5 the monthly ad budget).

Now if I put back in the $2500, can it be scaled to $12500? Then take the $12500 and make more?

Yes, definitely there will be a ceiling I will hit, after that I won’t be able to make more without giving up on the ROI. But is it really that quickly scalable or am I missing something here?

Let’s say I do this for each one of the fields (social media, Google Shopping, etc.), can you exponentially grow (up to certain point ofcourse), meaning could you jumpstart your business this way?


Questions:

1) Is this the right approach? Should I hire marketing experts right from the start instead of trying to do it myself? (Thought 1)

2) Is it scalable? Or am I just naïve? (Thought 2)

3) Is it better to hire different freelancers/agencies for different fields? A different freelancer for Google Adwords, different freelancer for banner advertising, etc. or hire on all-in-one agency? (I would rather not depend on 1 person/agency but have different people for each one)

4) How does a small business with not much investing money find experts? Do I just go to google and type in ‘ad agency Google Adwords’? I am a bit afraid of getting ripped off by agencies + their fees must be huge I assume for a small business like mine.

Do they work with a fixed fee every month? Or is it also possible to find someone that does it for a small amount to start off with and then when it scales, asks for more (win-win situation for both)

5) If I hire experts, besides asking for their portfolio, website and average ROI they are currently getting, what else should I ask for?

ecommerce,"First store, 0% conversion, where to focus?","Hey /r/ecommerce,

This is my first store (dropshipping). I started it after encouragement from an acquaintance and semi mentor who I no longer have contact with. 

I originally started with the expectation of doing nothing but free+shipping. I've since refocused into turning it into a brand, focusing around the twitch platform. 

The store is slick-gamer.com. I run an affiliate program through leadDyno and adwords display ads campaign which nets me ~300 visits a day ($25 budget, ~500 clicks). I have made effectively zero sales in the two months the store has been live.

I'm not a designer. I took the theme as a suggestion from previously mentioned acquaintance. I've done my best to restructure product titles and descriptions (something about SEO, plus the generated info is jarringly bad). Likewise, I've done my best to alpha channel primary images for products. I've cut prices down to ~15% markup after assuming that was the culprit. No change.

Things I think might add value, but not necessarily drive sales: 

I'm building out a service for streamers to have a slot on the front page when they are live with a similar viewing experience as Twitch. It's ready to go, just collecting influencers. 

Personal merch pages, unlisted from the main site and unique to the individual influencer. Again, this is ready to go, just working on collecting. 

I'm all ears for suggestions and constructive criticism!

dropship,"In my first month, I just learned a hard, valuable lesson","To make a long story short, I found an item I could sell for a little over $500 and make a $62 net profit off of. I figured since I was making such a nice profit, I'd donate a portion of the sale to charity. 

I chose to donate 10% of the profits. At the time, I mistakenly thought this meant 10% of the *net* profit. Big mistake. 

I just got an email thanking me for my charitable donation of $52. It seemed a little high but then it hit me: I chose to donate 10% of the *gross* profit. Not net.

ecommerce,Is it launch time with the list I have?,"Oh boy, So I work for a company with 17 Souvenir, Gift and womens fashion shops on the strip.

Since the one thing our company has that alot of others don't is the sure volume of foot traffic from the strip. So I set up a campaign in every store saying get a free gift by texting this info to this number. I buy closeout souvenirs like magnets, key chains etc. Some gifts do better than others and some locations do better as well. After 2 months I have close to 10,000 solid emails.

ecommerce,Expensive item + expensive shipping. Need your input,"Hey everyone

I have a Woocommerce store where I sell niche and bulky items. My products are also available on Amazon but for higher than my total shipped price.

Here is the dilemma. My items are priced $205, $265 and $305 based on the configuration. And flat rate shipping is $50 as they get charged same dimensional weight of 90 pounds. As you can see my shipping cost looks like it is up to 25% of my products. Everyone is so used to “Free shipping” people don’t want to pay hundreds for shipping a few items. Plus when the item doesn’t arrive in 3 days they send me an email saying they paid so much for shipping and it still has not arrived.

Adding shipping into the price makes my products look about 20 25 % more expensive on the first page. And there is this issue with the returns if I include the shipping. I have very low return rate but when it happens, currently they know that shipping will not be refunded and they need to pay the return shipping. Should I implement a return processing fee of $50 per item?

What would you suggest?",7,3,2018-01-06,ECOM,0.027949253097176552,0.9247148633003235,0.047335926443338394

shopify,Brooklyn Theme &amp; Facebook Pixels,"Hello,

I am working on my shop and try to get Facebook Pixels functioning. I use the Brooklyn theme and added the Facebook Pixels ID to my shop.

Facebook Pixels shows me only 4 events: PageView, ViewContent, AddToCart, InitiateCheckout

I added 
5 custom conversions (according to youtube): AddToCart: URL contains /cart   ///   ViewCollection: URL contains /collections   /// 
  ViewProduct: URL contains /product   ///   Purchase: URL contains thank-you   ///   Initiate Checkout: URL contains /checkout or /checkouts

1.
I recognized that Purchase can't work because Brooklyn doesn't use /thank-you in any URL. How I can solve this? I can't create a custom audience with Purchase as event (I think it is, because there is no activity yet).

dropship,Legal side of dropshipping,"Hello /r/dropship,

I have just recently discovered dropshipping and I am in a position where I can dedicate all of my time (i.e. work full time) to creating a dropshipping business.

I get the general idea of how it works etc., however I have a couple of questions related to the legal side of things. English is not my first language and I am new to this so excuse my lingo if  I use incorrect wording.

1. How do you tax your earnings? Do you own an LLC, are you a sole proprietor or just don't pay tax? To clarify, I am a EU citizen but I want to create a US-based business in Delaware (LLC) - I don't want to create an LLC in my home country. 

2. How are you protected against faulty/dangerous goods and similar claims from the customers? For example, let's say I start dropshipping stuff from AliExpress on Shopify. Let's say it's clothing and I have not tested the stuff myself, just picked suppliers based on positive feedback. One day I receive a claim from the customer that the goods damaged/are dangerous to their health or something where a simple replacement/refund is not possible. Customer might even threaten to take legal action against you. 
How do you deal with stuff like that? What do you include in your T&amp;Cs/FAQ to protect yourself from legal issues that might arise due to health concerns/risks/injuries etc.?

I will be very thankful for your insight. Feel free to point me to other resources too.

Thanks.",8,6,2018-01-08,ECOM,0.09141390025615692,0.882767379283905,0.025818707421422005

ecommerce,Selling Items from Booths,"What do you guys think? I was thinking of taking items that dealers have in booths at local antique shops and posting them online, of course with permission of the dealers. Are there any legal stipulations with the businesses that the booths are at? Ideally how it would work is like this:

A dealer has an item for (say) $100 at a booth at their local antique shop. With permission of the dealer, I would place that item on a website along with the rest of their collection and many others, and upcharge it on the website so I can cover shipping costs, as well as make a slight profit for myself. So say I charge $130 for this item online. That gives me the $100 to go to the booth and pay for the item myself, and then $20 to ship and $10 profit for myself.

Obviously every item would be different, but that is essentially how it would work. Since I would be going to the booth and paying the asking price for the item to the store where the booth is, I don't see any legal issues with it, at least not with the business where the booth is.

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",6,2,2018-01-08,ECOM,0.016408773139119148,0.8632949590682983,0.12029627710580826

dropship,Too many sales... [Serious],"Hi friends, 

So we've found a niche and scaled up to the point where we're doing about $30-$35k in revenue per day across 1k+ daily sales. We're currently using Dropified to fulfill orders with auto captcha, but we're finding that it's becoming almost physically impossible to process the orders as quickly as they're coming in. 

While this is obviously a great problem to have, I'm not sure how to proceed at this pace logistically. I've hired 2 freelancers on Upwork to basically be fulfilling around the clock, but they're not making much of a dent in the ~3k orders we have outstanding on our end (and not to mention the ~2k orders our suppliers have yet to ship out). The outstanding orders just continue to pile on.

I've scaled down the advertising a bit so that we can catch up and reduce the ""processing"" time our customers have to deal with, but I'm planning on scaling back up once we've caught up. I've reached out to the supplier about accepting CSVs of our orders, but they said they'd prefer we kept using AliExpress (any ideas as to why? We've done 10,000+ orders with this guy so he's very reliable). 

So basically the question is, how can we continue to do high volume using Dropified? Is it just physically impossible to do much higher volume?

Shopify promotes selling tickets online but I couldn’t find any themes that would fit.

thanks in advance",6,3,2018-01-09,ECOM,0.013001072220504284,0.909506618976593,0.07749228179454803
shopify,Quick Tricks to Increase Shopify Sales,"Thought I'd share a few tips on things you should change (if you haven't already of course) on your Shopify store to immediately improve your conversion percentage. I've labelled these out below, but have also uploaded a video found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=239OGYKdtBc) if you'd like a more in-depth run through on the below. 

Generally, these changes focus on store trust and credibility, but have a pretty big impact. Personally when I first started off, I made the below changes and saw an increase of roughly five or so additional sales per day. Quite profitable especially if your ASP is high. 

**Removing ""Shipping and Taxes Calculated At Checkout""**

* In your Shopify Admin search panel, search for ""Language"" 
* Scroll down and search for ""Manage Checkout Language"" 
* Click on the ""Cart"" tab at the top of the page 
* Scroll down and find the sentence, either deleting it or altering it.  

Psychologically, customers do not like seeing a potential fee on top of the product cost after they've added the product to cart. Personally, I like running free shipping campaigns, so I found success in changing the line to ""FREE Shipping Included"", which obviously gives them further incentive to proceed to the next step, checkout and ultimately convert. 

**Removing Order Notes** 

* Find ""Theme Settings"" in your Shopify admin panel 
* Click on ""Settings"" 
* Click on ""Cart"" in the left-hand side theme pane 
* Uncheck ""Order Notes"" 
NB: This may vary in certain Shopify themes 

Unless you're in a business wherein notes are required before purchase eg. SAAS, I'd recommend removing this box all together as again, it's an unnecessary item that may deter the customer from converting. The cleaner and simpler the checkout process, the better.  

**Removing “Powered by Shopify** 

* From your Shopify admin panel, go to ""Online Store"" 
* Go to ""Themes"" 
* Click ""Actions &gt; Edit Code""
* In the sections folder, open the footer.liquid file 
* Ctrl + F and search for {{ powered_by_link }}, or just search ""powered"" 
* Delete the tag. 

Simple one but keeps the website looking professional and standalone. It also links out to Shopify's website , which is great for Shopify but not for our business.

**Adding Trust Badges to Product Page**

* From your Shopify admin panel, go to ""Online Store"" 
* Go to ""Themes"" 
* Click ""Actions &gt; Edit Code""
* In the sections folder, open the ""Product Template Liquid File""
* Find ""addtocart"", usually at line 100 or so depending on your template file 
* Below this piece of code, you want to add your trust seal image hosted on CDN/Cloudfront. I've uploaded a specific piece of code with the image hosted already, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=239OGYKdtBc) and copy paste. 

Side note, be sure not to overload the site with trust badges either. I've seen stores with trust badges littered all over the screen and it looks very unappealing and ironically, more dodgy than ever! 

**Customising ATC Button**

 From your Shopify admin panel, go to ""Online Store"" 
* Go to ""Themes"" 
* Click ""Actions &gt; Edit Code""
* In the sections folder, open the ""theme.scss.liquid"" file 
* Ctrl + F and find ""Link and Button Styles"" - do note certain themes name this section differently such as the Supply theme, so you'll need to do some digging around for the section 
* At the bottom of this section, just before the next section, type the following in: 

&gt;AddToCart {

&gt;width: 380px;

&gt;}

* Note: A hashtag should be included before ""AddToCart"" (couldn't insert it due to Reddit Markdown formatting). Also, the ""380""px should be altered to properly fit your own store layout. 

This one's often missed even when trust badges are added to the product page. It's essential to change the size of the ATC button in order for it to remain a focal point of the product page as we obviously want as many customers to click on this. 

Also worth adding trust badges to the header and checkout header by editing your logo in Photoshop and adding in trust badges manually. 

Hope this helps guys, relatively simple stuff but has significant impact on conversion percentage.

- Have the product delivered any day in the coming 7 days, but only between 8am and 5pm

ecommerce,Question(s) about limited time discounts,"Hey everyone 

Last week I asked about shipping and got insightful replies. Therefore here I am with another set of questions and dilemma 

Just a reminder that my main products are priced between 250 and 350 shipped with 50 dollars in shipping cost.

My products are seasonal. It is agriculture and hobby related and booms in early spring and peaks at late spring and summer, and start dying down in mid September. Anyone who buys the items between mid November to early January probably won’t be using it till spring.

In late spring the volume for add ons increase and slow down in mid summer. 

So here is the question

If I want to increase sales through limited time sales (like I did for Black Friday), should I do it in the season or out of season?

Making them at the beginning of the season may increase the conversion rate, but discounting them at the off season would help me turn the inventory into cash and reduce my warehousing costs. So it is more like huge discounts on TVs before Super Bowl, and Christmas decoration sales after holiday season.

I don’t want to make sales too often as it would reduce the average value of the product. How can I keep the value? Should I just include a related tool as a gift at the original price of the item?

My sales in November were slim to none. A few people asked if we were going to have Black Friday sales so we decided to make one. Turns out everyone was waiting for that and sales were good for that week.

Which brings the dilemma about seasonal pricing. Like having high season vs low season pricing. I know people won’t be using them in winter. Anything bought in high season would already be in use. 

How about price protection? Do you offer something like that on your site? As in if you reduce the price for a sale, do you give refunds to people who bought it in like the last month? When we did our Black Friday sale, we only had like 4 orders within he last month so we emailed them, let them know we can either refund or send them a gift that is valued quite high in our website with their next order. We are praised with our customer service, and that email back alone asking refund or gift brought additional orders. 

Anyways, I would appreciate your responses.

Thanks",2,5,2018-01-14,ECOM,0.06356272101402283,0.8904989361763,0.04593830928206444

ecommerce,"I'm getting slammed by orders from stolen credit cards, help?","I'm using WooCommerce and Authorize.net and have turned on any of their fraud detection settings I can find that sound helpful. 

What I'm currently doing

* Require CCV code
* Require matching address and zip
* I don't ship to mail forwarding addresses
* I don't ship when the email address is something along the lines of ""cklef4926@gmail.com""
* I no longer ship to mismatched shipping and billing addresses
* I always google maps search the address to validate it
* I don't ship to non-US addresses
* I don't accept orders from IP addresses outside of the US
* I always check the IP address to make sure it originates from the same location as the shipping/billing address
* I am extremely cautious of orders that pay for shipping and don't take advantage of my free shipping for orders over $150

I'm currently dealing with a chargeback from an order that had a matching shipping and billing address that had a real home address and I spoke to him via email. 

Right now I get more orders that are fraud (most are stopped and unable to check out) than I am getting real orders, but I still have to deal with lots of orders from stolen credit cards that make their way through the checkout process and are accepted by Authorize.net as valid credit card info. 

Most of my traffic comes from SEO. I should be getting more orders than I am given napkin math of average low conversion rates and my traffic. 

Do other eCommerce shops have this many fraud orders come through?

I have come to the conclusion that our entire credit card system is abysmal. It's WAY too easy to steal credit cards and use them.",31,15,2018-01-18,ECOM,0.06030874699354172,0.9102712869644165,0.029419954866170883
ecommerce,What is the REAL cost of returns?,"I’m in the process of closing my store and doing a post-mortem on what went wrong.  One of the things that stands out is how costly the returns were to us.  When we were in the middle of it, I didn’t really realize it. We were busy enough that the cost of the shipping is what we really considered the cost of a return because it was the most obvious.  Then, any disposal because we could write that down to zero. But, with the other stuff that we took back and tried to re-sell, we ended up incurring a lot of costs that weren’t apparent to me at the time.  When I add up the cost of shipping and then estimate the time lost waiting for a return, the time to process a return, and any discounts we had to use to resell, I have the loss at about 25-30% of the original sale price. With a return rate of 26%, that adds up.

This is far from the only reason  we failed but it didn’t help. I know that if I try to do this again, I’ll focus hard on improving our returns process and trying to cut these costs.

Has anyone else done this kind of math and, if so, what is your real cost of returns?",15,13,2018-01-18,ECOM,0.0403655543923378,0.9190113544464111,0.04062306508421898

What does it entail and how do you go about offering such a global service?

What I Have:

* Website with SSL set-up to host app
* Amazon AWS server that will need to communicate with 4 input fields within the Shopify app page (in Shopify Admin)
* Working development app made in Python/HTML/CSS/JS. Only visible to install and use from my local machine. Python uses Flask to create an app to communicate with the Shopify development store.

What I Need:

* Help running the Shopify App from my web server (or AWS) so that it can be listed publicly and installed using a non-local URL.
* JS Code that can then be used from within the embedded shopify app to communicate with the AWS server.
* Might need help saving/reading from MySQL DB via Python.
* Might need help working with Shopify's REST API in order to create payments / get other data from Shopify. 

I've been fussing with SSL / Getting the Python app to communicate with my webservers database all day and I've realized I just don't know enough about web development/communication to reliably get it set up. I'm hoping to hire a developer that will help me set all of this up either via instructions or by simply just doing it for me. However, please note that if the hired developer would rather just set everything up on their own I'll require them to sign a non-competition/NDA in order to protect my product.

ecommerce,E-commerce best legal practices advice / insight requested,"Hello everyone,

I’m looking to start my own e-commerce online (Shopify) Business. I already have my vision, products and ideas etc now what I have left to do is actually implement it.

I’d rather make sure I set everything up legally correct.

I know I need to apply to tax where I have nexus, but in order to do that I need to define myself as a sole proprietor, LLC, or corporation.

This is my biggest road block right now. I understand the differences i.e sole proprietor is simplest but offers no protection of my assets (which sounds scary). Though I don’t intend to sell anything illegal, who knows what random person could sue over. 
An LLC sounds fitting , but is only valid in one state.. would this mean if my online store (shipping everywhere) ships to somewhere outside of my state I’m doing it illegally? Also I’ve heard that people get LLCs from somewhere else like Delaware - could this be illegal ? I live in Wisconsin but my store will be online through Shopify (most likely drop-shipping before growing into personal branding)

My other concern is that I’m just starting out and I know there is a possibility of my idea not actually working out (sales and all). What then? I’ve paid for a company name that is not relevant anymore so if I want to try something new I’d have to reapply for new company names? 
(My company name reflects the type of product I’ll be selling)

First of all: if a customer would like a return, how do we go about it? As in, are we urged to use a paypal account and just transfer them the funds in full? (Assuming the product is low cost price and we can afford to do that)
Is there any source that you can show me that explains returns, policies, etc?

Second: how legitimate are the youtubers that post the tutorials, success stories, etc? I would love to follow them and their stories if they are going to help, but I also don’t want to sit and watch if they are going to be of no help, and their reason for posting is simply their own income.

Lastly: other than returns, what are the financial risks of dropshipping on shopify? I can only think of returns, and the shopify monthly costs. Is there anything else? I understand that you may lose money on influencers if it doesn’t bring customers, but that’s just learning!

ecommerce,Can't find solution for ecommerce multi-level approach,"We are looking for a solution that enables this scenario:

We, as manufacturers, have main inventory of all our SKU's.

Distributors logs in to online store and places orders online to us. We fulfill to distributor.

End consumer shops in open online store. Can choose delivery to home (closest distributor or dealer with stock fulfill) or pickup at store (closest dealer with inventory fulfill).



It all has to be in one ecosystem, so that we as manufacturers can see the whole chain of orders and inventory. So it's not about just providing the distributors with a white label site.

dropship,Tutorial: Print on Demand for Beginners,"[PRINT ON DEMAND FOR BEGINNERS &lt;Part 1&gt;: SETUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrnNt16l7U)

Hey fellow redditors 

For those interested in Print on Demand, which has always been around but is recently blowing up in popularity, I've linked a [video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrnNt16l7U) for people just starting out or looking for additional strategies to supplement their current store(s). 

If you have any eye for design, I highly recommend at least trying your hand in Print on Demand. In comparison to dropshipping products from your usual suppliers, POD is a relatively simple business model without the usual headaches such as shipping time, returns, customer service, niche competiton etc.

I've had a number of questions relating to POD, so thought it'd be useful to share with everyone a free step-by-step tutorial - nothing paid, no edits, no BS. Just a straight forward tutorial. The tutorial will consist of: 

- **Part 1**  Shopify, billing and POD setup
- **Part 2:** How to create winning designs and strategies
- **Part 3:** Driving traffic via Facebook ads and influencers 
- **Part 4:** TBC based on feedback, potentially how to scale 

Hope this helps, so if you're just getting stuck into POD or want to jump right in, be sure to check out the series!

Checking on the article they linked I read about collaboration between web of trust and facebook, so I registered my domain there and I'm waiting for the ""seal of approval"" from web of trust.

I checked there and my website actually is not inflicting any policy, (I sell fashion items such as rings and stuff, nothing copyrighted or anything).

The way facebook is marking me as spam is not letting me post my domain name, share it, or create ads trying to promote to the domain.

Today I registered a new domain and changed it in shopify, after doing this, I posted the url clean in my personal profile, as private post (just to check if facebook would allow me to post it). all good there, and one hour later I receive the notification that my post was removed due to my domain being spam.

I don't really know what to do. I would like if anyone that could know what is happening could take a look at my store or my domain to tell me what could be happening that is causing these flags. 
I believe that for this you will need my domain, (which is logical) and I haven't read rules against posting it, but if it's the case I'll remove it (or a moderator).

ecommerce,Review generation plugins for a Magenta store,"Hello,      
Wondering if anyone here uses review generation plugins to send review emailers. I've checked yopto and avejana so far because they both offer ability to submit reviews within the emailed itself.      
I think that's important as it saves several clicks.      
Anybody used either of these tools and your experience with them? Or you old you recommend any other plugin for a fairly large magento store.

shopify,Graphic Designer taking on a Shopify project,"Hi Everyone,

I have a client looking to create a Shopify site and I told her I can take it on for her. I only have minimal experience in using it, but I have used other sites like Squarespace quite a bit. My background is in branding/web/print design and I know some basic HTML/CSS. I know Shopify uses Liquid coding. That brings me to my question. My client wants to use a theme from Shopify and customize it. I started to look into it, and it seems a little overwhelming but not too bad. How difficult should this be? And how much coding should have to be done?

ecommerce,"How to decrease your stores checkout cart abandonment, starting immediately!","I went to a furniture store a few years ago looking for my first sofa. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes as a salesman greeted us the moment we stepped through the doors.

He walked us around the store and explained the benefits of each sofa. We knew that the store offered a unique 5-year, interest free repayment plan. It was pretty fortunate —  we didn’t have £5000 in cash to spend on a sofa.

Eventually we found one that we liked, and told the salesman that we were interested in buying it. 

We were sat drinking a cup of tea on our soon-to-be new sofa when he returned with the paperwork. He asked again about the style of our living room, and reiterated how well the new sofa was going to fit in. He explained that he’d been selling the sofa for over 30 years, and that it was actually the same one that his parents had owned throughout his childhood. And they still had it. Why? Because the store puts every sofa they sell through rigorous testing to make sure that they won’t split.

He said they were so confident in the reliability of the sofa that it came with a 20-year guarantee. Even if we just didn’t like how it looked in our living room, we could simply let them know within 30 days and get all of our money back.

Finally he explained that it was a good job we’d stopped by that day, because the sofa normally costs 20% more, and it would be back up to full price a couple of days later. We were getting a classic, reliable sofa. Risk-free. For a great price.

We bought the sofa.

Advertising pioneer Claude Hopkins once said: “Advertising is multiplied salesmanship. It may appeal to thousands while the salesman talks to one.”

Just as advertising gives one the power to multiply the efforts of a single salesman, selling online is an amazing opportunity to sell to multiple customers with a single checkout process.

But only if you ask for the sale, and only if you persuade your prospect to hand over their money.

My point is this: when a prospective customer puts a product in the shopping cart on your website, they are simply raising their hand to say “I’m interested.”

It’s the equivalent of me telling the sofa salesman I was ready to buy. But he knew the truth. I was ready to buy, but I was not ready to hand over my money.

Neither are your prospects.

They want to be reassured that they are making the right decision. They want to know that they’re not taking a big risk. And they want to buy straight away.

Imagine that the sofa guy had simply responded to my interest by saying, “Thanks. Take a seat. It costs £5k. Here’s a card reader. Just leave it on the side when you’re finished. Thanks for your business.” What do you think would have happened next?

I’ll tell you. I would have soiled myself at the thought of taking on £5k debt for a sofa. I would have wondered what would happen if we didn’t like the sofa when it arrived. I I would have convinced myself that it would be better to go home and think it over. And I would have snook out of the door without the salesman seeing me.

Yet, this is exactly what most website checkout carts say. It’s why many, many prospective customers abandon their online purchase. And I don’t need to tell you that it’s a hell of a lot easier to leave a website than walk out on a salesman that’s looking you straight in the eye. Which means one thing: websites must be even better at closing the sale than an individual salesman.

So here’s the remedy. A simple 4-step process for closing more sales.

1. Create an offer that’s hard to refuse

2. Erase all traces of risk from the prospects mind

3. Insist on action and tell the customer exactly what to do

4. Make it easy to give you money

I don’t want to drop those abstract ideas and leave you hanging. But I also don’t want to make this so dense that it’s hard to act on. So if you’re already selling a product or service, implement these two things to immediately to decrease your checkout cart abandonment rate, and increase sales....

1. Add a testimonial right next to the pay button

2. Define a guarantee that places ALL of the risk on you, and explain it to your prospects.

Why? Because there are never more doubts, objections, fears, running through a prospects mind than immediately before they hand over their money.

Reassure them that they will get the outcome you’re promising, by showing them the words of somebody that already has the result.

Then overcome all of their objections by taking on all of the risk.

A note on guarantees: just like the rest of your copy, the guarantee is all about the prospect. If you’re worried that an amazing guarantee will increase returns: don’t be. It might lead to slightly more returns, but the increase in sales and revenue will win out.

Here’s the crux of it: when you really do take on all of the risk, your prospect will think, “wow, they must be really confident in this”. And they will buy. If your product or service is great, they won’t return. If it’s not, work on making it great first.

I’ll give you an example. There’s a company that sells underwear containing fragments of gold. I can’t remember their name, but they used to advertise on Jay Abraham’s podcast. Anyway, they offer one of the best guarantees I’ve ever come across. The underwear isn’t cheap. It contains GOLD. It’s USP is that you can wear them for a week and they don’t smell. Disgusting if you ask me, but pretty funny. Anyway, the guarantee goes like this: buy a pair and try them out. If you don’t love them, get all of your money back. And keep the underwear.

Sure, it’s probably pretty difficult to re-sell underwear. Especially when they’ve been worn for a week. But can you see the value in the guarantee? There really is no risk. You can buy them and get your money back if you decide that normal underwear will do just fine. It stands above most guarantees, though, by removing the need to return the product. You can just keep it. No time, effort or money required from you to return the product. Zero risk.

Another example.

The maker of an electric sewing machine offered to send a machine to people’s home, so they could use it for one week, for free. It even came with a man to show them how to use it. The ad said “let us help you for a week without cost or obligation.”

90% bought the machine.

To summarise: for an immediate increase conversions on your sales page and checkout cart… prove your worth and shoulder all of the risk by adding a testimonial and pre-eminent guarantee very near to the pay button.",5,9,2018-01-31,ECOM,0.0314647126942873,0.9203864634037018,0.04814880155026913

shopify,Making a Shopify App With Node and React?,"Hi all,

It seems that Shopify apps are mainly supported in ruby/rails. 
However, I'm more of a JS developer so it'd be better for me to use Node.JS along with React.js to create this app. 

Does anyone here know of any good app skeletons using node and react?
Also, a part that I'm having trouble comprehending is how my app would be displayed within the dashboard using the EASDK. 

Would it be called into an iframe and the uri be changed to my app's uri? Or would the uri of the shopify store be the same but only have the iframe load inside once the authentication by my server is complete? 

Thanks
