dropship,[Dropship.Place] Join our Amazon-eBay dropshipping webinar. 1st Feb 7PM PST,"Hi there, we at https://dropship.place are working to create the best dropshipping automation tool. It currently handles Amazon to eBay dropshipping and by handle I mean you can scrape for hot products, list them, get them repriced and process orders in batches.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I really mean it when I say it can scrape for products. We have made it so easy that I don't believe it's possible to make it any easier. You can feed it random keywords and it spits out possible dropshippers. Then you can scrape them to find their asins and then analyze those asins to check out the best offers and sales data on eBay. Easy as pie. We've also made the listing, repricing and ordering as smooth as possible.

**Webinar on 1st Feb, 7PM**

ecommerce,How to analyse your competition (Beginner friendly),"*I have no affiliation with anything shown below. Just some good fun competition analysis.*

**If you want to see some analysis in action, I have a 5 minute breakdown on dollarshaveclub.com here: https://youtu.be/8HvTcD0AXNI**

Hey Guys! The easiest way to get into a niche is to completely understand your ‘competitors’. Many people struggle with this phase of starting a business, and many people just don't do it. This is crazy. The amount of information you can learn from a competitors site is insane. From this quick guide hopefully you will see how that is true. Lets get started!

**The basics:**

This is the bare minimum I would say you should do. Learning what ads they are running, how well they are performing, and how their sales funnel works is SUPER important.

1. Start with this. Like their social media. Focus on facebook, twitter, instagram and youtube. These are the key essentials. View some of their content and take note of what they post and when they post. Take screenshots.

2. Go to their website. Read each page. Take note of all the plugins they are using. If they use a recent sales plugin, take note of how often they have been making sales (it will say 3 minutes ago, 15 minutes ago, 19 minutes ago). Keep track and estimate what they are making. If they ask you to enter your email for a coupon, do it. Take note of the words they use and the emails they start sending you (Do they appear in the junk box?)

3. Assuming they are remarketing, you should now start seeing their ads in your feed. Keep scrolling through your feed on each social platform and keep your eye out for their ads. Large companies will start showing up instantly. For each ad you see, take note of the number of likes and shares. Read the comments and see what the general vibe of their audience is. Are they tagging their friends, complaining or saying thanks?

**The More Advanced:**

Let’s get into the fun stuff. 

1. Add the product you are interested in into your cart. Fill out your shipping details (or fake ones), then close the page / never finish your order. Now keep an eye on your email inbox / junk mail. See if they send you a recapture email, and if they do record it.
2. If you wish, purchase their product and look at all the pages, the thank you emails, and see if they start marketing to you / determine their email strategies. Take note of how long it takes to get to you, their packaging and any promotions included with the product.

3. Go to similarweb.com and put in their website. Take particular note of:

* Global rank (below 100,000 and they are a big player)

* Category rank (if they are not very competitive, see who is higher)

* Traffic overview: If you are dealing with someone who is in the hundreds of thousands / millions a month, they are a big dog and likely have a well set up and researched sales funnel + will be much harder to compete with

* Traffic by countries: Are they targeting one country in particular? What are the top three? This is a good indication of where their ads and marketing are focused.

* Traffic sources: This is interesting and can be hard to understand. Basically search means their brand is well known, or are ranking for popular terms. We will look at SEO later. Direct is self explainatory. Referrals are interesting – if it is a high percentage, see which pages are referring traffic, and see if you can also jump on board.

* Search: If they are pulling in a lot of organic search traffic, look at what keywords they are ranking for. Use google keywords to determine the difficulty of ranking against them and figure out if it is worth the effort. Are there easy long tail keywords floating around?
* Social: take a good look at this. What social media pages are winning? Are they pulling traffic from free forums and other such sites you can push your way onto?

* Audience interests: There is a bunch of golden information here that you can use to target your ads.

* Similar sites: See who their competitors are. Rinse and repeat what you have done above.

**You now know a lot about their site. You must therefore ask yourself: Can I beat them?**

**Have fun and stay safe!**",7,7,2017-02-02,ECOM,0.028817085549235344,0.9292241334915161,0.041958753019571304

ecommerce,Where to sell my e-commerce store.. help me calculate my site worth.,"Hey everyone.
I want to put my e-commerce store up for sale. It is for a specific niche but can reach a very wide demographic and be purchased for use year round. I don't want to share the url just yet because I am thinking about potentially keeping the site if I do not go through with the sale.

I just started the site last month and it has been decently successful.
I've made 47 sales with a gross income of $500 with minimal advertising. 
It costs me about $5 to get 3 sales with an avg profit of $7 (including money spent on advertising).
I run all my marketing through my Instagram page which has about 1600 followers right now.

My Conversion rate is about 2.63% based on a total of 1,700 visitors this month. 

I've tried my luck with flippa with other sites but am wondering if there are any other outlets where I would be able to sell my site. Also, I'm wondering if it is reasonable to price the site at ( Monthly Gross X 12 ).
 Should I use another way to value the site? I can only image the monthly revenue growing so I feel as if my current evaluation would be undercutting myself.

The product is completely dropship with the only overhead cost being my monthly shopify subscription.

I want to sell this site because I want to focus my time on other side projects and the extra money would be nice right now.

The price that I came up with was 2,400 - which would include all socials, current marketing plan, knowledge about my demographic.

I am wondering if there are any sellers out there that wish they could use a certain piece of software or kind of software that just isn't in their budget.  Maybe a dashboard to manage multiple marketplaces?  A repricer?  A simplified/cheaper version of some existing software you already use?


I am a programmer that is already very familiar with bunch of ecommerce APIs (Amazon, eBay, Shopify, Newegg, ShipStation, working on Lightspeed) and I am trying to gauge if there is a demand for simpler/cheaper ecommerce tools.

ecommerce,Am I Being Scammed On Alibaba?,"I need to order a large number (500-1000) of a single product to sell on my Shopify store. They have sent me a price list and everything looks good apart from the shipping and the cost to have my logo printed on the box and the product. I don't have any experience of ordering in bulk from china so I don't understand the standard prices.

[Here are the full sheet of the cost per quantity.](https://i.imgur.com/UBZmLO4h.jpg)

**Summary of costs**

* Product sells for $1.22 per piece (good)

* To get the box and the product private labelled costs $0.6 per piece extra (bad), this is almost half the cost of the product. Is this normal?

* Shipping by sea seems fair in lower volume (bad) , but she did quote a higher price when I first asked her what it costs, which gives me the suspicion that they are inflating it. Also it's weird, if I order 500, 1000 and 2000 the shipping increasss $70 each time but when I order 4000 the total cost of shipping triples from 2000 (it cost $200 to ship 2000 and $600 to ship 4000). Which is strange.

* Shipping by air prices are ridiculous. **The air shipping costs more than the products and the scaling of price as the volume increases is odd as well.** 500 pc which costs $600 dollars will cost $500 dollars to ship by air, when I double the order to 1000 pc the cost of shipping TRIPLES instead of doubling, to $1500. When I quadruple the original 500 order to 4000pc, the shipping prices increases 12 times. $4800 for 4000 pieces, $6000 dollars to ship.",15,8,2017-02-06,ECOM,0.04761095717549324,0.8909085988998413,0.06148047000169754

ecommerce,How are companies able to ship low-priced yet weighty items cheaply?,"I have a small web shop, and a few of my items are a bit heavy (7 lbs) and shipping them across the country is very expensive (nearly $30, even with my small business account with ShippingEasy). This high price of shipping really cuts into my profit margin.

However, there are many companies that ship relatively inexpensive but heavy items (for example a $15 gallon jug of cleaning agent which weighs 8lbs). How are they able to do this? I know that high-volume sellers get better price breaks, but is the price break THAT significant to make this profitable?

I typically ship with USPS, and their ""Parcel Post"" option, which was supposed to be a slower, but cheaper option, is usually MORE expensive than Priority Mail! WTF?? I've looked into FedEx and UPS, but the prices are about the same. And no, my heavy items don't fit into USPS Flat Rate boxes :(

UK-Launch first then international so multisite/language and currency is a must. 

Must integrate with multiple apis trust pilot and sage etc. 

Microsoft Nav integration.

ecommerce,Does a commerce store exist that allows for different payments to different people depending on the product?,"Greetings, 

I am looking to build an commerce website, but I have multiple sellers looking to sell various products through my site. I want to set my site up so that depending on which product is purchased, the payment goes to a different place.

Example:
Customer purchases a ebook from my store - Payment goes to Joe. 
Customer Purchases a video from my store - Payment goes to Hannah. 
Customer purchases a photo from my store - payment goes to Corey. 

Do any platforms exist that would allow for this to work? Also, would these services require a transaction fee? Thanks for your help!",5,3,2017-02-08,ECOM,0.03271633759140968,0.938747763633728,0.028535906225442886
ecommerce,"To dropship, or not to dropship...","That is the question.

Or at least, that's been my burning question for the last several weeks and it's eating me up mentally. 

So I'm fairly close to launching a site catering to pretty niche crowd. At the moment, most of my designs are t-shirt based which are being fulfilled by a print fulfillment service via my shopify store. I'll be keeping an inventory of other items though (totes, mugs, jewelry, etc), but I'm already waffling on if my concept of dropshipping the t-shirts is a good idea or not.

The pro side of things, the customers have a nice color selection they can choose from, my studio space is small so I don't need to stock huge inventory, and it has minimal upfront costs.

The downside is wait time of shirt delivery, out of my control quality concerns, and / or customer service issues with the t-shirt printer.

So here is my question: Is it a bad idea to start with a drop shipping service now, but eventually stock inventory later? Would customers get frustrated having color options taken away from them? Do customers get frustrated if they have to return an item, have to go through the dropship service instead of me? Or should I just take their return, have a new item printed up, then rushed to them? Actually I think I just answered my own question on that one. haha

Anyway, I'm curious what other folks think about this. If anyone does something similar or does it differently. I'm completely open to suggestions. Also, I'm using Teescape as the print service if that matters. 

What stinks is the closer to launch I get, the more my brain becomes a doubting Thomas. I'm beginning to wonder if it's purposefully picking at every detail it can in an effort to prevent the sites password being unlocked. I swear, our brains are our own worst enemy at times.",9,3,2017-02-08,ECOM,0.1605067402124405,0.8157710433006287,0.023722218349575996

One thing that would help make the decision, is if one of the platforms had an app where my customers could build their own subscription box. In other words, I want my customer to be able to add whatever products they want to a subscription service. 

The way I see this working is that they would just add products to their cart normally, then from the cart page they can choose to subscribe to all the products they added to the cart. So the app would have to allow for any combination of products and any price.

dropship,Working whilst travelling!,"Hi guys ,

I've been running a few of my own online stores whilst also running an eBay &amp; Amazon store . 3 months ago sales for one of my niche products on eBay and Amazon absolutely sky rocketed! I had booked to travel New Zealand and Australia for 6 months and this scared me as I began thinking I would not be able to manage all these orders.

To my amazement i am still able to complete the whole order process with a few life saving apps and processes I have put in place. My supplier is an absolute saviour and has adjusted to my specific needs and is still able to fulfill all the orders I give him. I am travelling now and had some hiccups at the start with the banks blocking certain payments for products but used a superb app that was not blacklisted by my bank so I could still pay my supplier!

What I'm saying is you can literally work from anywhere (literally an iPhone!) with dropshipping! I wrote a few weeks back about getting involved In a dropshipping video course I am putting together , so message me your email and I will add you to the list when it is completed!

I'm trying to hit a techy geeky stoner niche. I'm considering doing a free + shipping promo just to get some attention.

Also, I was initially doing free shipping worldwide, but now I'm considering doing some free + shipping campaigns (which inherently means that won't work). I've set up my shipping so that it's free if the user buys 4 regular priced items or more. Given the mark-up and the cost of the items I'd do free+shipping with, I think that's fairly safe.

shopify,how we built our store without paying Facebook,"Up until my last business, each and everyone was bootstrapped.

We had no ad budget to waste in the cash sucking black hole commonly known as: Facebook.

We had to scrap for each and every customer when we started our first eCommerce store 4 years ago.

Since then we have appeared on the BBC1 TV Show Dragon’s Den, now rank 1/2 for the most popular keywords in our niche and have a manager and distribution centre, effectively running our business on autopilot.

After being interviewed on the Shopify podcast about how we did it, I have had quite a few people ping me with questions…

(After all, Facebook has enough cash without us Shopify players giving them more)

1. Have a cause greater than cash

Give your customers a reason to connect with your brand, a mission, a story.

We decided to rally against the conventional wisdom about male fashion with the motto: “Men should wear what they want as opposed to what they should”.

This connected powerfully with a niche customer segment.

2. Encourage every customer to create and share UGC

When strapped for cash, you need your customers to bring you more customers. If you have a strong brand they are more likely to do this as they join you on the crusade.

SO powerful… simply because their small but engaged social following are actually real people (not fake followers on “influencer” accounts) and as they are friends it is reasonable to assume they could also be interested in your brand story.

3. Celebrate your customers

If someone does share, make a BIG deal out of it.

Post it on your channels and tag them (massive social proof) and drag that content back onto your site (again, massive social proof).

(We are building a tool to automate steps 2/3, comment below if you want to Beta test, for free of course)

4. Reward with discount codes that can only be used by F&amp;F

When someone does help you out, you must reward this good behaviour. But that does not mean you need to stop them from spreading the world. 

Hand out exclusive discount codes that cannot actually be redeemed by them, but by their friends and family.

If done correctly, on average, each customer you find, will bring you 0.5 more customers, fuelling a viral buying loop that will skyrocket your growth.",13,11,2017-02-14,ECOM,0.019282590597867966,0.9207719564437866,0.0599454790353775

ecommerce,"Influencer Marketing - Tips for low cost, high return, and creating valuable partnerships?","Hi /ecommerce!

My TL;DR backstory for asking this question:

I started a store to house my designs last week: shopclssy.com. It's currently in ""soft launch"", where I've mostly advertised to friends, am spending most of my time designing and launching on IG/FB in product batches, and capturing marketing information to launch fully soon. I've also been experimenting with FB ads, but don't plan on increasing ad spend until I have a larger stock of items.

My fulltime job revolves a lot around ""influencers"" in the beauty space, so I have some grasp on how substantial influencer marketing really is. I'm targeting Instagram influencers in the fashion sphere to partner with Clssy, and have been sending out two versions of partnership offers:

1. The influencer buys whatever they would like from the site at cost (e.g. if they would like one case after our talk, I send them a one use coupon for x-profit off their order). In turn, I ask for at least one promotional post with the item(s), and I offer them a unique discount code to offer their followers to track their sales. They get $1 of every sale made, up to $100.

I have had one person take this offer, even though they put out money up front.

2. I offer one free product of their choosing, in return for one promotional post linking to my IG. 

No one has chosen this offer.

I have reached out to 8 influencers with less than 4k followers, and received two responses of their upfront cost (about $100-150 per post, which I can not afford), and one who took me up on the offer.

ANYWAY, on to the main question:

ecommerce,What I learned from starting a drop shipping store.,"Not sure why but the entrepreneur in me has always wanted to start a drop shipping store. So I opened a store up using Shopify, uploaded my product, ran an add on Instagram and waited. 3 sales came in my first day. A few the next..and by then end of the month I had 87 sales. You must be thinking, wow this is awesome! Well, I guess the order volume is, but I'm drop shipping from Ali so that part not so much. 

The seller that I'm drop-shipping all my products from offers e-packet ( which is a shipping method that you want if you’re doing drop shipping).Great! So all my orders were placed and e-packet was selected (mind you I had to pay $2 extra for this). Now, the flood of emails come in. ""Where is my order?”…”What’s taking so long”.. So I go into Ali and check all the tracking numbers to see whether or not my customers are receiving their packages. Low and Behold NONE of my packages were sent using ""e-packet”. I immediately contact the seller and the response I get it “Sorry we cannot send you product via e-packet”. Then why is is offered upon purchasing the product?! Shipping time was now increased to a max of 45 days. (Ridiculous) I’m about as frustrated as my customers who have ordered their product and not received it after waiting on month.

I start replying to the emails and eventually have to make a template, because they’re all emailing about the same problem. Most customers are understanding, some are not. Some take to Instagram and comment every single post on your profile bashing your company. For those specific customers, I went on Amazon, bought my product, bit the bullet and ate the shipping cost, and sent it to them USPS Express. Not sure if they’re happy or not but I might be able to enable my comments again :)

I decided to write this up because I had to authorize my first refund and have learned a valuable lesson in the process. My key takeaway from this is simple.
Dropshipping is not for me. 

I have since placed an order for actual inventory and the shipping time for my product should be decreased from 30 days to 3 days ( If I survive). 

TLDR : Buy your test product before you start shipping to customers and absolutely make sure that the seller can actually use e-packet to ship your product(s).",19,19,2017-02-17,ECOM,0.19081521034240723,0.7859470248222351,0.023237789049744606

dropship,"8,000,000 handmade products to drop-ship","Hi Everyone, 

This new platform allows you to drop-ship from the list of 8 million products that are handmade and unique. The good thing about handmade products is that they are low quantity so the margins are high (very low competition - you can mark it up as much as you want); It's not like Aliexpress that hundreds of people drop-shipping the same products. This platform automates the entire process as well if you own a Shopify store.

I found out they offer a drop-shipping reseller program which got me thinking about opening my own shop online. One of the things I can't figure out is what I actually need to pull this off. The supplier is located in Thailand and I am living in Texas.  My questions are:


*Do I have to collect sales tax from customers? If so do I need an federal EIN? State EIN? I don't plan on having employees. 


*Do I have to actually make a business like a LLC for this?


*Where is my ""business"" actually located? Is it my room in Texas? Wherever I have an internet connection? Thailand?

ecommerce,11 year old e-commerce site-Need Advice,"I apologize if this somewhat long-winded. I started my site back in 2004 and use a cart called Shopsite.  My site was doing close to $800K in revenue about 5 years ago and slowly started a death spiral to where it's doing roughly $200K now.  Luckily, Amazon has picked up the slack and then some so business (overall) is still good.

I've gotten to the point where I feel I NEED to switch shopping carts and I'm going to go with Shopify.  I have a list of roughly 60K customers and feel that the tools within Shopify/Klaviyo, it might allow me to extract some more value out of them and get rid of dead leads.

So when I registered my original domain, it was mainly for SEO purposes and has dashes in it.  I've since registered the direct .com version of the name and originally was planning on building the Shopify site on there, then 301 redirecting my old site to Shopify.  My domain is very, very specific to one thing that I sell and it's basically been my bread/butter.  However, I've expanded into other products since selling and was wondering if I should take the opportunity to build a site that is more all encompassing, while redirecting my old site there.  Here are my options:

1) Do the plan above and redirect old domain to new ""direct hit domain"" on Shopify.  Keep the site small and focus on the same niche, possibly add some ancillary products to build out the offering.  As an example, it would be the equivalent of toastersdirect.com while adding in products like coffee makers, bread makers, etc.

2) Redirect to a slightly broader domain name that will allow me to add a lot more products (same category) and still have the domain name make sense. Using the example above, this would be something like kitchengeardirect.com or something.  In this case, I could still advertise toasterdirect.com, but it would essentially just redirect to kitchengeardirect.com

3) My 3rd option is to basically do both, but on seperate sites and with a little crossover between the 2. 

In case anyone is wondering, I think my brand name has gotten a fair amount of traction since I've been selling so long.  For example, my site has about 10% of the visitors coming after searching my brand name.  So, it does make sense to have my direct hit domain name, but they'd end up finding my site either way.

Any thoughts?",10,6,2017-02-17,ECOM,0.03877343609929085,0.9318168759346008,0.029409658163785934

Thanks in advance for the help. 

&amp;nbsp;  
**EDIT**
This is more specific information that I added to a reply.  Not sure if it helps explain my request or not.  
&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;The database comes from a large distributor who then gave it to various web design affiliate companies.  The distributor then recommended those companies to re-sellers like my company.  So we've paid one of these web design affiliates to ""run"" our site that we use to sell to the end user.  However, they've done next to nothing other than keep the database up to date.  They provided one generic layout and the back end software to keep product information and cost.  Beyond that everything was left up to us.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Plus, their platform is so limited that we have little to no options for customization or additional plugins/features as they don't allow full access to the software.  Literally all that was allowed were banner changes and a few content pages.  Plus our rep from this web design company thinks computers are run by magic and can't open anything that isn't directly on their desktop.  So we've been stuck with basically the same site for a few years, and although it has 70,000 products, the layout isn't great and it's severely lacking in features.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Recently the distributor has made the database available to re-sellers that buy X dollars worth of inventory from them.  I'm told(by someone from the distributor who seems to actually know what they're talking about)that it's structured really well for integration into various platforms and CMSs and that they'll provide limited help for small problems related to the database.  So I think it won't be as difficult of a task as it could be.  Plus it's thousands of dollars cheaper haha.",4,5,2017-02-18,ECOM,0.046781837940216064,0.9259386658668518,0.02727946639060974

shopify,Opening my first Shopify store,"I have been doing lots of research for a while now, and I think I'm ready to take the step to opening my shop (women's attire). A little of what I've been doing before getting into question:

I've researched tons of drop shippers, and have narrowed it down for the time being (I plan on using multiple, and possibly integrating some Etsy/local sellers eventually). 

I've delved more into Facebook advertising; we used it for our service business in the past, but stopped due to word of mouth (ergo, I only learned the very basics). 

Now for the questions:

1. I see these beautiful shops and websites with amazing photos; if I wanted to do something like that, would I have to purchase the items and photograph myself, or do drop-shippers offer a variety of photos to you? I want to present the content attractively.

2. Email solutions: I have yet to obtain my domain, but would like to use an associated email for the business; does Shopify offer email solutions, aside from fowarding services, or should I use a provider such as Domain? If you use the Shopify forwarding service, what are the pros/cons?

3. Advertising: what has been the most profitable for you? I plan on using Facebook initially, and integrating Instagram at some point. What works for you?

4. SEO: I've heard a lot about this, and while I'm competant and willing to learn, I'm far from being an expert on things technical; is this something I need to learn, or that Shopify will help me with?

ecommerce,Supplier for branded packaging? Bags with custom printed toppers?,"I have some miscellaneous items I'd like to be able to easily package in branded packaging that looks decently professional.

I'm thinking one or two sizes of bags (fairly thick, heavy bags) with a cardboard topper that has my branding printed. The toppper could be stapled onto the bag like you see with a lot of miscellaneous items hanging in stores on pegs etc.

Can anyone recommend a good source to get these bags and custom printed toppers? I certainly see some results on google, but prices are higher than I'd like at the places I've seen. Also there are a million places to choose from so I'm hoping for some recommendations from your experience. I'm hoping for something like $0.10-.15 per bag+topper (small-medium size bags) to keep costs down. The couple of places I did a mock order were quoting like $125 per 250 toppers, not even considering the bag cost.

dropship,Do you dropship with Aliexpress? Increase your margins,"UPDATE 

As of March 9th, Aliexpress pulled the plug on cashback from Aliexpress pocket, as a result you cannot get double cashback anymore however you can still get up to 10%.

I have discovered a way to add 20% to your existing margins using Alibonus which is an Aliexpress cashback service, I have written a review from a dropshippers perspective of it on my blog here https://dropshippers.blog/2017/02/06/alibonus-aliexpress-cashback-service-review/

Alibonus offers 10% max cashback however we can go even further by doubling that using Aliexpress Pocket.
http://sale.aliexpress.com/__pc/pocket.htm

Example:
Product costs $100, so normally we get $10 cashback from Alibonus if we buy it with cash, instead we first buy Aliexpress Pocket balance worth $100 for which we get $10 cashback and then when we purchase the product using Aliexpress Pocket we get another $10.
You can see it in my example here https://i.imgur.com/4bElnR4.png

For some people doing 100 orders a week this can really increase your profit by thousands.

ecommerce,Amazon FBA?,"My wife and I are entering the e-commerce world. We plan on focusing business locally and from our website in the beginning, but I have also been doing research on Amazon FBA. I'm learning that everything I've found on FBA has very low margins. I'm beginning to question if I could ever make a profit there. I know its possible, but it just seems a bit daunting currently. 

Are there any go to sites that offer quality products that have not been saturated on Amazon? I've been looking at Alibaba and Global Sources, but everything just seems to be knock off. I also don't like how anything has any UPC or product info listed. Is it common for this information to not be included? 

Another random question, do you guys try to order and have vendor send directly to Amazon? It seems that vendors who don't ship directly to Amazon are the vendors whose products aren't clogging Amazon. Is it worth the shipping cost to receive the items then ship them myself to Amazon?

ecommerce,Building a service-oriented ecommerce site -- Looking for help building a form submission system that takes payment.,"Hey there! I've been trying to get an ecommerce site built but I'm having trouble finding a good set of plugins for wordpress.

Been trying to find a plugin or simple combination of plugins that will integrate with wordpress to take a form submission (with file / image uploads) and take payment and then stick the files in dropbox or similar service, or send via email to a destination address if payment clears.

I've looked at doing it with woocommerce and a few of the more common form plugins for wordpress but it doesn't seem like they integrate very well. I'm not above paying for the right plugin but I don't necessarily want to start throwing money around immediately only to discover that a certain plugin won't work with square or stripe, or requires some additional plugin that costs more and introduces redundancy.

Anyway have any ideas on things I should research to accomplish this workflow? It seems simple in theory, the issue that crops up consistently is integrating a payment system. Getting a proper form made hasn't been an issue. I have an existing Square account that I'd be happy to use but the rest of the site is built on Wordpress, so I don't necessarily want to switch to their Content management, though if people tell me that's the answer I could be open to it.

ecommerce,What eCommerce platform best suits my needs?,"First and foremost: it has to be buy-able, so I can host it on my own anywhere I want. Pricing doesn't matter.
I do have some very basic webdev (html/css) skills. I do programming so picking up skills in this region is not a problem (saying that because I heard about wooCommerce).
So, here come the bulletpoints:

* Whole site has to be account protected (or at least email+password assigned by admin). No account == no entry at all

* There will be no payments through the site

* Will have at least 1000 products (hobby range)

* Not necessary for all the products to have their own pages - could be listed one after another based on category, but all products should have photo, price, in-stock number, eventual restock time

* Shouldn't be too hard to add new products, and change stock amount/restock time

* Customisable, bonus points if there's plenty of tutorials and help to do it

* Basket system - customer can add things, but they will be deduced from in-stock only after staff approval. Basket should be sent by email to both staff and customer. Or customer only if there is some order-picker system available.

* We really would like to have some customer accounts system in place (as mentioned, to use the shop) and keep basic order/customer info.

ecommerce,Need some feedback recovering from a conversion rate drop over a year ago,"We dropped a full percentage point in conversion rate at the beginning of 2016.  We re-designed our site from a table-based site to responsive design in August 2016, assuming conversions would increase, but it actually stayed stable for a few months, until it started declining again at the beginning of this year.

The suits are in panic mode at this point, and we're drastically re-designing the site again. They're convinced it's the navigation/structure of the site, but looking at the data, I struggle to understand how the navigation is the culprit as the conversion rate dropped before we even re-designed the site.

I have to believe it's something else like our free shipping threshold is too high or we have poor product descriptions or poor product photos which is making people bounce.  The bounce rate actually dropped about 1% after the site was re-designed, but has slowly started climbing up again since December.

I don't see anything that indicates users are getting frustrated that they can't find what they want and are leaving the site.

Will I have to create my own script to take that into consideration the amount of characters they are engraving for the pricing or is there an app I haven't found yet that will do that.

Also, we charge a minimum. If they got that plate with 2 characters on it the total comes to $2.40 but the minimum overall price would be $6.00. Is that possible also?",2,2,2017-02-24,ECOM,0.029581140726804733,0.934455931186676,0.03596293553709984

ecommerce,Confused about integrating ecommerce website &amp; CRM. What's your approach?,"I think i may be overthinking this at this point, so if anyone can knock some sense into me, I'd appreciate it. 

&amp;nbsp;

My partners &amp; I have set up our wordpress + woocommerce ecommerce site. Email via ZOHO (free version). We're trying to keep initial costs low during the setup and upgrade as required. 

&amp;nbsp;

My concern is that I would like to keep orders, customer inquiries, communication organized from the start.

&amp;nbsp;

Eg. &amp;nbsp;

- Orders are placed on site
- Woocommerce transfers order to CRM where myself or my partner can update the status of the order
- CRM emails updates to the customer
- CRM adds customer emails to specific lists for future email/newsletter campaigns 

additonally

- Customer emails/inquiries are managed by CRM and allows us to see who is managing the issue/inquiry
- Past communication from the customer is recalled with new inquiries. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've started reading into CRM software to tackle this but I'm confused as to what wordpress plugin's or independent CRM services to use.

&amp;nbsp;

I understand that this may require multiple tools, but if anyone can point me in the direction or suggest what they are currently using, it would really really help.

I've looked at ZOHO crm and a woocommerce plug-in so far.",8,3,2017-02-25,ECOM,0.051694776862859726,0.920253336429596,0.028051836416125298

The scenario is that I have a product (a light switch) which is for all intents and purposes, the exact same product but sits in 5 categories (vehicle types, such as Ford, VW etc.)

Is it better to have that product available across 5 vehicle types, but as a single product, or create 5 products, which I could obviously rename and have a single instance of the differently named product in each of the 5 categories?

If it turns out that having a single product tagged into the relevant 5 categories is the right way to go, is there a way to create a unique url for the product in each of it's categories?

shopify,Shopify establishing secure connection slow while using Comcast,"I run a website called Laptopmountain.com and use Shopify to host it. Couple of days ago I installed the Instant search + app to help my customers navigate through my laptops. After I installed it, I did notice some odd things happening. First is that my home page slide show wouldn't appear for 20-30 seconds. I can see on the bottom left corner it says establishing secure connection... That takes about 20-30 seconds. Once that completes the slide show will then appear. 

Why is this a problem? Because if I go to my home page and then immediately click on laptops before the establishing secure connection has finished it won't load the Instant Search + app and on the left hand column it only displays my product tags with no filter, which looks horrible and will drive people away. 

I started doing some testing and here's where is gets weird. I use Comcast for my internet and when I connect to my Shopify site using Comcast I have this establishing secure connection delay. If I use my T-Mobile hot spot, iPhones LTE, or connect on the same computer and browser using a VPN it won't have any issues. I also started going to other websites hosted by Shopify and they all have the same connection delay.

Another thing I noticed is if I go directly to my laptop page while on Comcast it will always load the filter no problem: https://laptopmountain.com/pages/search-results/collections-laptops. I run into problems when I first land on my homepage and then try to go to the laptop page before the establishing secure connection has happened. 

I have had my brother in California using Comcast have the same problem. My friend down the road using Comcast has the same issue and my father 30 minutes away in downtown Denver has the same problem. We all use Comcast and it seems that other secure websites like banks and Facebook have no problem establishing a secure connection in less than 5 seconds. 

If you use Comcast or another ISP I would really appreciate if you could test to see whether or not you are experiencing the same problem as me with my website and other Shopify sites. Also, if you have an explanation for this, or a fix I would be so happy. Thank you everybody.",3,2,2017-02-26,ECOM,0.12364248931407928,0.8539025783538818,0.02245498076081276
