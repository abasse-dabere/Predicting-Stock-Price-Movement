shopify,appending link_to_tag text ( or just link_to _,"I want to have a list of tags in a collection but I want to append them.

shopify,[Hiring] Is anyone very familiar with ajaxify.js?,"I'm looking to hire someone that can help me with shopify's ajaxify.js

I'm looking for an expert that has used this before, and is superb at JS. I can't afford extra bugs being introduced, and would rather pay premium for someone who really knows what they're doing.

Here are the current problems:

Background: ajaxify.js doesnt seem to support an 'add to cart' button thats on the collection pages/homepage (I don't like forcing them into the cart detail page to click add to cart). The entire script seems to work on a single ID though, and I need it to work with multiple buttons on the page. It DOES actually work about 90%... but:

* I want the id's to be changed to classes in the css and js, so that there is no invalid html, and the js follows suit
* Currently when inventory sells out, it places the notice under every single 'order now' button on the homepage because of this whole ID thing. its probably search for a forms on the page or something.
* There's a hard to reproduce bug that I haven't figured out how to trigger yet. Basically during rare times, when you click order now the response from cart.js doesnt have a token, its just an empty json response. So the end result is that you click 'order now' and the ajax cart pops up, but the item doesnt get added - it continues to say 'empty cart'. I assume this might also be related to the ID thing, considering the only thing i changed on this theme was adding the multiple buttons on homepage, and the bug doesnt happen if you click on a product image and add to cart from product detail page.

Please PM me with rate and a description of your experience as I described in the intro of my post.

ecommerce,Best 5 e-commerce platforms,"E commerce business has set new prominence and records for online community. The market has grown with a rocket speed and changed the mind-sets of people bringing their confidence towards Online shopping. According to Forbes, “For the full year it estimates that US ecommerce will generate $262.3 billion in sales, an increase of 16.4% year over year and slightly higher than the 16.2% increase last year. By 2017 eMarketer estimates that there will be $440 billion in sales for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.8%”. Now that’s really a massive expansion to the online marketing entrepreneurs.
Whenever a person plans to start an e commerce website, the first puzzle that strikes his mind is which platform to choose for development of his ecommerce website. With ecommerce growing at a rapid pace, the e commerce platforms for website development are also growing at a fast speed providing e commerce business owners with a variety of options to go with. Let’s discuss some of the top e commerce website design and development platforms ruling the market now.
Shopify – Shopify is one of the most popular platform with around 75000 sites using it as an e-commerce platform. It provides a wide variety of add-ons with attractive as well as professional templates to choose from the storefront. They provide a 24/7 customer support to the users with variant ways of getting connected with them. More of business start-ups come up with choosing Shopify because of its easiness, providing good looks and fast speed, and also that it is SEO compliant. It comes with unlimited bandwidth of adding products &amp; other impressive features which makes it most popular. The only concern being the price goes a little higher than other platforms.
Magento – It is a powerful tool with rich features and is well known for its large numbers of plug-ins and extensions available in marketplace. It is a robust platform giving its users high level of functionalities &amp; customizability. One of the best thing about Magento that makes it one of the best content management system used till date is that it is highly scalable &amp; there would be no need to upgrade to other platform on further scaling up in future. For small businesses, it can be too complex as it needs enough server space to work efficiently at high speeds.
Volusion – Volusion also has a big share in the market, covering more than 90% of its market in US delivering its customers a large variety of features with a user friendly interface. It provides a reasonable cart to offer abandoned cart recovery and decent monthly plans availability is there. To its cons. I would say the add-on store is not that large enough like Shopify and BigCommerce provide and also there is no blog setup available.
BigCommerce – BigCommerce is another known platform claiming 17% of the top 100,000 sites which are using hosted e-commerce solutions. It is more popular in small to medium sized web stores. Till date, around 57,000 sites overall have been developed on BigCommerce. It provides a user friendly interface and a large knowledge base which is catered by the BigCommerce University as help resources. It began as a software product developed by Interspire that could directly be installed to your website and became famous after transforming to a hosted shopping cart. It possesses Google trusted store certification assistance and gets easily blend with Google shopping, eBay, etc. BigCommerce has standard range of plans available.
DrupalCommerce – This is exclusively for sites built on Drupal 7 platform. Drupal is one of the most used and reliable open source CMS framework for design &amp; development of websites. It allows the user to build any type of e-commerce website making hardcoded assumptions as low as possible about the business needs of the owner. The smooth integration of DrupalCommerce with Drupal CMS framework gives a top valued outcome over other platforms especially when it comes to content marketing &amp; blog integration. It follows an easy implementation of Search engine optimization strategy.
 
These are some of the most popular tools available in market today, there are many more like WooCommerce, 3dcart, Etsy, etc. Which platform to choose totally depends on the size of your business, your business strategy and of course your budget. These three factors are enough to make you decide what should be your platform. If you still have a confusion, come to us.

woocommerce,Pick and choose subscription options?,"Hi, I've looked at many different WooCommerce plugins, but I'm not seeing the best solution for what I need, and I'm wondering if anyone here has any ideas? Here's an example scenario of what I'm trying to accomplish:

Given a selection of products, a customer chooses a basic subscription service (say, $50/year), and can pick and choose 5 different products as part of their subscription. This could be access to a video, an eBook, or whatever else; any combination of 5 products (or however many the subscription plan allows). The larger scope of this plan is that these subscriptions will be grouped by different people. For example, a customer can subscribe to David, and choose 5 of his products, and/or they can also subscribe to Timmy, and choose 5 of his products as well, 2 subscriptions total. There doesn't need to be mix-and-match functionality between different groups; picking up to X products should be self-contained within each group. 

Currently, I'm using the Groups and Subscription plugins; if I need another plugin to get this kind of functionality, please let me know.

No actually physical work is involved (red flag?), and you basically make use of a technique called arbitrage, to find Amazon Prime listings for a cheaper price, and then sell that product on Ebay. I am not involved in this scam, but from my digging, this is what I found just from roughly 15 minutes of searching.

1. You pay $20 to watch a few videos. By this time you are into it.
2. You end up paying thousands of $$$ for ""training"" on how to maximize your profits because you are so into it by this point.
3. You need to find others to sign up, because you get a cut, and you have already lost thousands of dollars. (the MLM side of the scam).
4. You are then told to break the TOS of Amazon, by relisting items from their site on Ebay. This part is important: If you don't already have an Ebay account, you will be forced to purchase all these items before hand. Think about that and if it's really a good idea to you. Furthermore, if you already have an Ebay account in good standing, why would you need to participate in DSD?
5. At this point, your sales are probably flat (since you put very minimal work into it), and you will need to recruit some people to help make your money back. Then you are told to go write a blog, make a youtube video, or some other way of internet marketing, in order to recruit more people to your scheme. It's really pathetic ya'll, just look it up on youtube or Google... (Along the lines of ""I MAKE $5000 PER MONTH!!! type posts)
6. After this point I don't know what happens, since these internet bloggers all seem to be millionaires living happily in the South Pacific or something, and their blogs all just vanish into thin air. Goes to show... 

If something seems to good to be true, then it is, no question. It's veeeerrry hard to make money on the internet, anything which says otherwise is most likely a scam. This is only after a few minutes of researching, so please feel free to add to my post and let others know what is going on. This scam is really taking off, and we need to nip in the butt before it does too much damage to already slim margins we are working with.

EDIT: TL,DR: DSD is a scam using arbitrage to sell products on Ebay which are listed on Amazon. This scam is going to drive down your profits, in the long run, unless it is put to a stop, which shouldn't be hard, since it is against Amazon TOS, so give them a shout about it, or face losing business!",7,5,2015-02-05,ECOM,0.07185672223567963,0.9002666473388672,0.027876634150743484

woocommerce,Question: Customizing woocommerce with gravity form product add-ons,"Hello r/woocommerce 
 
Please excuse me if this should not be the place to ask questions like this.
I am a WP newbie and am currently setting up an online shop with WP and woocommerce. Since it will be highly customizable product I have gravity forms product add-ons for woocommerce installed which allows me to add a complex form with product options to a product.
 
Now what I'm trying to do is to have this form triggered from the product page via button (""customize this product"" for example) and displayed in a lightbox. Here is an example of how this works: http://www.editsuits.com/product/blue-s120-2/. The default is that the gravity form is displayed directly on the woocommerce product page.
 
How would I need to accomplish this? Do I need to make the adjustments in woocommerce, gravity forms or the template?

First get SumoMe. It allows you to use custom script &amp; HTML.
here is a video explaining how to get started https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59id2CLc4ew

Once you get to the point where he is showing you how to setup a newsletter pop up stop. Click on **advanced** on the left hand side. Input this into the code box. http://pastebin.com/q8YhCMJS

This is set up to have an image of your coupon on top. Then a paragraph. Then the call to action buttons.

Obviously put in your image source etc...

Also the dimensions of the print window can be adjusted. You should be able to customize most aspects of the pop up.

And with SumoMe you can control when / where you want to show your pop up.

Like I said if there is any interest I can post better instructions, answer questions, or whatever.

I am starting with about 1000 common products, but I am thinking forward to include a Vendor portal where companies can include their specs on my site.

I want to automate the following:

*Charge companies a monthly/yearly cost to host their product manuals on my site

*Once subscription is active, they can add their parts and PDFs

*If they don't renew their membership, the products get taken down.

I see a lot of subscription, membership, and vendor options out there but I don't know how to work them together to produce the desired effect described above. Most of them assume vendors are selling a product and that requires a commission. That's not the case with my site. The end user will be receiving free products.

I've seen this question a lot of times, but since each case is a different case and people in this subreddit are so helpful and nice, I'm daring to ask this question again.

I found this nice growing niche on something on I like, and I'm currently in the process of making this website, searching for reputable vendors etc...

Hypothetically speaking, lets say this website is going to be about gift wraps.

The big question is which platform should I use to start?
 I'm currently bootstrapping, starting with an ecommerce store and a blog, but with a plan to be like bodybuilding.com, being the #1 website on my niche with tons of articles, forum, and a whole community around it, so it definitely has to be scaleable.

- Prestashop, the themes look awful and from my little poking around it seems like very app, extension is very expensive
- Shopify, nice themes, but I heard u can't buy thru back channel and people on this sub hate it.
- Bigcommerce, looks easy like shopify and nice themes, currently leaning towards it.
- start with bigcommerce, shopify and later on move to magento or something else

ecommerce,Niche research struggles,"I have been STRUGGLING with niche research lately. I think it has to do with a combination of analysis paralysis and procrastination. I've opened and closed a couple of stores and I really believe the main factor for their failures was due to weak main keywords. So now I'd like to build a store from strong keywords. 

My question is, would anyone lend any tips on how they find and validate niches for business? I'm not asking for the recipe to the secret sauce but rather would love some ideas for the process so I can apply it to my own searches.

For instance, right now I have a list of general interests I have. From there I want to write down all of the keywords associated with those interests. Then, I would try to go as far ""down"" those keywords as possible, hopefully yielding some long tails. 

Once I have those long tails, I will plug them in to google trends. If the trend is declining I'm probably going to pass on it. If trends look okay, I'm then going to use keyword tool to check the volume. If they get more than 4000 local searches/month they are winners.

Finally I'll want to check the top ten of the serps to see  if the competition is beatable. I have long tail pro to analyze those metrics. 

So that's basically what I have. Am I missing anything? Are their other tools you'd recommend I use for any of this? Thanks for reading!",2,1,2015-02-10,ECOM,0.07788614183664322,0.8786759972572327,0.043437834829092026

ecommerce,ECommerce to Boom This Valentine’s Day: 5 Things To Do To Boost Your Sales,"More than $20 billion dollars will be spent in one day, making this one of the biggest shopping days of the year. 

Had a so-so holiday season? Don’t fret because Valentine’s Day is right around the corner. This global celebration of love transpires into one of the biggest shopping seasons around the world and rakes in more moolah than Halloween, St. Patrick’s Day and the Super Bowl put together. Needless to say, merchants focused on gift-giving catalogs are making a mad rush to be ready for this shopping spike.

According to Business Insider, 53% of women would dump their boyfriends if they don’t get a gift on Valentine’s Day. More than 9 million pet owners will buy gifts for their pets. 11% of America will get engaged and the highest number of at-home pregnancy tests will be sold a month later.

Jewelry, flowers, candy and condoms will see their highest sales this time of the year as well. All this means that consumer spending will be really high across several categories this February 14th. Here’s a glimpse:

Revenue generated during Valentines Day

In 2013 alone, Valentine’s Day generated about $20 billion of sales across the United States and is set to cross that figure by a huge margin in 2015. Popular categories include flowers, chocolates, jewelry, clothing and accessories, novelty &amp; hobbies, electronics, adult &amp; lingerie, travel, wedding, home décor, animal, books, music and health.

The clear winners amongst these product categories are flowers, candy and jewelry, so online merchants selling such items need to be well-prepared for this day celebrated by more than half of America

On this day, when a third of America types a romantic message on their mobile, more than 40% of the gifts will be purchased on mobile. Online merchants need to brace themselves for the huge traffic that is expected from mobile devices and provide a compelling mobile experience that converts traffic into sales.

There are several fixes merchants need to make to be mobile-ready – the most important ones being loading fast, looking good and having a smooth checkout flow.

To many merchants who sell products in romantic categories, this is going to be the biggest time of the year – probably even bigger than the recent holiday season. So you need to pull out all the stops to serve your customers, particularly mobile shoppers.

With Valentine’s Day less than a month away, now is a good time for florists, candy sellers, jewelers and merchants in neighborhood categories such as health, hobbies and fashion to start thinking about discoverability and conversions.

Here are 5 things that merchants can do to maximize their Valentine’s sales:

1. SEO: Online merchants need to build their SEO profile so they are discovered when a user searches for “nearby florist” or “Valentine’s Day jewelry”.

2. Sharing: Shoppers should be allowed to easily share their favorite items on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest to increase the likelihood of referral traffic.

3. Recommendations: For shoppers who visit their site, merchants need to make recommendations on the landing and product pages for similar or related products. This usually results in higher average order value.

4. Infrastructure: Shoppers are impatient and demanding. Mobile shoppers do not wait more than 4 seconds for a page to load. Merchants should make sure their site loads quickly.

5. Push: Merchants with apps should start sending out push notifications about special offers, early bird discounts and new inventory that might be of interest in the context of Valentine’s Day.

So spread the love this February 14th and keep couples glued together with your fancy gifts and a great shopping experience!",0,1,2015-02-10,ECOM,0.03478147089481354,0.9158450961112976,0.049373481422662735

ecommerce,Can Someone Evaluate These Ecommerce Business Ideas?,"I want to start an online retail/information website, I have a lot of experience building websites but I am not all that creative when it comes to coming up with something unique or new. 

I narrowed down my ideas to a few possible choices: 

1. Camping/Outdoors ecoomece store, along with a blog that will updated regularly for related information, reviews, etc. 

2. Reptile Supply: ecommerce store for cages, lighting, etc. 

3. High-End House Furnishings/Fixtures - Sinks, lights, furniture, etc. All high-end items. Sort of like a mini-overstock or wayfair. 

The biggest challenge I see with any of these 3 is finding reliable suppliers to drop-ship directly to my customers. My other idea was to just drop-shop directly from overstock/wayfair and just do the ""gift"" option for all orders so the customer does not see any pricing or anything. Not sure how well that will work long-term. 

Do any of these ideas seem like they would be worth pursuing? My goal is $1k/month profit within the next few months.",2,2,2015-02-11,ECOM,0.03232993185520172,0.9258185029029846,0.04185162112116814

ecommerce,Ways to get feedback on e-commerce sites,"Hey guys,

I'm wondering how ya'll get feedback on a) products, and b) your site / checkout from your users. Do you usually rely on customers emailing in, or is there a better way? Or, do you typically know before posting a product how well it will fare so it's kind of useless to hear what people think?

We had this pain-point at my previous company because such a small number of people would email in or fill out surveys, so I'm thinking about hacking up some code to solve it. The way it would work is to ask a question like 'Is there anything getting in the way of your order?' and then the user can click around the page to point out what's a blocker. Or, on a specific product it would let the user leave comments on what they do / don't like.

It would be great to hear all and any thoughts, and what, if you had a magic wand which built you the perfect solution overnight, you'd conjure up.",6,3,2015-02-12,ECOM,0.04768525809049606,0.918684184551239,0.03363059088587761

dropship,Shipping Times with Chinese Drop shippers,"I've found a niche with minor competition at best. Naturally, this is rather exciting and provides plenty of opportunity, but along with that come many problems. Mainly the fact that I cannot find any dropshippers/wholesalers in North America, and everyone is in China. With them being in China, their shipping times are insane (nearly a month). That's not a viable option, but unfortunately, they are the only source(s).

I'm essentially looking for any solution or ideas you guys may have had to deal with this problem, or past solutions you've arrived at. Would it at all be possible to cut these shipping times to something reasonable? ~10 days being a reasonable amount in any way?

ecommerce,Building an eCommerce Venture with Magento,"One of the most primary decisions to make when looking to establish a new eCommerce business online is choosing the platform on which you build your venture, and there are many.
The Growing market of Content Management systems (CMS) offers an unlimited variety of eCommerce solutions that differ in scale, pricing and flexibility. While each seems to provide for different sets of needs, it seems that more and more online stores, and particularly the larger stores, choose to work with Magento.

Of course, there are alternatives to Magento, which can also provide a good solid ground for building your eCommerce venture. These include many small systems, as well as WooCommerce which is a WordPress-based solution, and Shopify. Both of these are great for small stores, and they are relatively simple to handle, but they become problematic when large scale inventory and shop customization are involved. So if you wish to create a large store, Magento might be more suitable for you.

**Some background about the Magento CMS**

Magento was first released in 2008 under the name Bento. Since then, it has switched hands and names until finally reaching it’s present owner – “eBay”. Magento has been regularly released in numerous editions, the latest one being published as recent as February 2015 – as we write these lines.
Today, according to builtwith.com, Magento’s market share consists of almost 9% of the entire internet, but when looking at the top million sites – i.e. the million sites that make the most revenue per year – we see that Magento is responsible for 14% of them. True, the success of your eCommerce venture depends on many different variations, but the infrastructure provided by the Magento CMS definitely gives a solid ground for success.

The main benefits of Magento

**Budget**

The initial installation of a Magento store is almost 100% free. All you need to do is download the free version of Magento, setup your hosting (which could cost initially about $20 per year max), choose one of many free themes and start inserting your products.
Magento is perfect for eCommerce by default, because it was designed for this exact purpose, so things like managing your inventory, special promotions, coupons, payment gateways and product attributes are made to include all the options you could possibly need. It is also mobile responsive and designed to cope with extensive customization. The default installation comes with all these robust tools built-in, so unless you have any specific requirements, it should be enough as a starting point.

**Endless Possibilities**

There are many themes to choose from, some are available for free and some require a premium charge. As for Magento extensions, out of all open source solutions, Magento includes the largest variety of possibilities for store owners, with every feature you could possibly think of already available on the extensions marketplace.
These include extensions that can do just about anything: Encourage Newsletter subscriptions, add magnifying glass to product images and even turn your store into a Dropshipping Marketplace!. There are several brands tat develop Magento extensions, you can check some of their online shops for solutions: CM Plugins, Extendware, Fooman and more.

**Community support and Shared Resources**

The immense community of developers who are already using Magento is a huge advantage that provides free support: there is no feature that hasn’t yet been developed; No problem that hasn’t yet been solved and dealt with, and all of these solutions have long ago been documented and published, so they are widely available on multiple online resources.
Similarly, if you need to add a feature that is not included in your default theme, it is very easy to find it among the huge variety of extensions available for free or for sale on the Magento extensions marketplace.

**Challenges**

Along with its robustness, comes also a challenge of the system being heavy, which can be slow if not operated properly. For this reason, it is recommended to have a proper hosting.
Another challenge is that sometimes, the common shop owner might find Magento a bit too complex to customize, so in cases where you want to have unique features, the help of a Magento expert becomes a cost to consider.",0,1,2015-02-15,ECOM,0.02582104690372944,0.9371195435523987,0.03705943003296852

ecommerce,How do I set up a profit-sharing plan?,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm totally stumped right now. If anybody can provide any assistance, it would be really appreciated. 

I work for a small company that does ecommerce, mostly via Amazon and eBay. We've been a small business for almost a decade, and we've been chugging along okay so far without a real marketing department. This year my CEO has tasked me with digging into online marketing, doing everything from SEO to website redesign, to creating content for blogs, to solidifying our brand, the whole shebang.  And to incentivize me to not leave the company, he wants to set up a profit-sharing plan to augment my low salary.

The problem is, he wants ME to propose the details of the plan and submit for approval.  Now, nobody in the company knows what to expect from this coming year's marketing activities, so nobody has an objective idea of how much the marketing team deserves.  Also I don't have the faintest clue what a typical profit-sharing plan looks like. I don't want to risk asking for too little because this prospect is one of the few things preventing me from leaving, so if I don't get enough at the end of the next fiscal year, then I would've wasted more than a year's time.

Are there any good resources for creating a fair, performance-based profit-sharing plan?

EDIT: to clarify, the profit sharing plan is not the kind that adds to retirement, it's distributed annually.",5,1,2015-02-16,ECOM,0.038863442838191986,0.9247468709945679,0.03638967499136925

ecommerce,The eCommerce Store Sold Out in 6 Hours (Viral Marketing Trend),"In this post, we are going to  share the best takeaways of “Shinesty” eCommerce business success steps of going viral.

Identify an under-served niche
When they started out, it was a small store concept – more of a part-time endeavour and they chose Shopify as their eCommerce platform.

“I thought if not anybody else, the prospective business would atleast serve me”. - Chris White, CEO and Co-founder at Shinesty

They focused on designs connected with the patriotic side: Eagle jackets, Red, White and Blue shorts etc.

Build a brand that reflects your own personality:
The one thing common to fast growing clothing brands is the emotional connect they have with customers. All three of the founders are often sarcastic and have a sense of humour that’s ‘in your face’. Shinesty is an extension of that.

“They regularly post interesting stuff. It is funny, ridiculous and reflects our lifestyle. He believed to introduce the brand subtly and let the engagement take care of the rest.”

The team had their ‘aha! moment’ when we started getting incredible feedback on social media.


Talk to your first customers and learn:
They used talk to every single of their first customers. They asked them questions like – why they are buying from us – on what occasions do they wear the clothing etc.

Going viral:
‘Google Trends’ is a good place to checkout online trends and gauge interest in your niche product.


Always be operationally prepared: 
“Customer service is priority for us and we are working hard to fill the gaps. We sell crazy clothing to make people laugh, not mad  “

This includes industry equipment for science equipment used in companies and labs as well as other types of equipment sales for maintenance. I have worked for companies small and large, but want to work for myself if possible.
  
  
I have built eCommerce websites, but never learned about adding **drop shipping** to a website so that when someone puts in an order, I don't manage manually. Rather, I have drop shipping set up so that when an order comes through, it fires off to the original manufactures in order to drop ship the order. I believe the best way to make money off of this is to have a slight mark up on the product on my site and having the drop ship ordering fulfill at a lower price.

ecommerce,Shipping for Beginners,"Hi


I am very new to ecommerce so this question is almost certainly stupidly basic, but I can't seem to find an answer online. I have never shipped anything before. 


I understand the software aspect of shipping (to a greater degree), but how do I actually get the product to the customer.


For example if I have 50 products I have to ship per month. If I have everything ready to ship from my house (product in box, fully labeled) where do I go to ship them? 


If I am using UPS or Canada post, do I physically go to UPS with all of them and drop them off? (assuming product is small in size). 


What if a business has to ship out 500 products per month. What do they do? 


How does your business ship their products?

woocommerce,How to Customise Shipping Costs and Avoid Abandon Carts on Your Online Store?,"Everyone who’s managing an online store has seen the scenario when customers show interest in your products, add them to their cart and just nearly buy them, but suddenly change their mind and abandon their shopping cart.

There could be many reasons causing such scenarios: It could be that your site’s loading speed is too slow, checkout process is too complex, or that your customers simply found a better price on one of your competitor sites. However, recent studies have shown that out of all the possible reasons, the number one factor causing customers to abandon their order half way through the checkout process has to do with unexpected shipping costs. While there are many ways to recover abandoned carts, there are several measures worth considering that can lower your shipping costs, making your products more affordable and attractive.

**What can you do to lower your shipping costs?**
how to reduce shipping costs and increase conversions on your online store
Firstly, you should thoroughly research your shipping options. Remember that your shipping price is a lot more than just a few extra dollars. For many of your potential customers, its what makes the difference between choosing to buy from you or from someone else, so exploring the different couriers and shipping companies available, you might choose to prefer a slower delivery for a better price, or change the packaging you use to reduce the overall package weight.

**I’ve reduced my shipping costs but customers are still intimidated**
If you’ve done all of the above and still hadn’t managed to reduce your shipping costs and prevent abandon cart scenarios, here are some alternative tactics:

**Offer free shipping**
Naturally, the idea sounds frightening at first, but think of how much money you spend on marketing? Free Domestic shipping doesn’t cost you much, however if publicized properly it can be a major lead generator, so you should look at it as an investment. Let everyone in the world know that you’re offering free shipping, and you will most definitely see an increase in orders. That being said, you should check your margins to make sure you aren’t cutting on your profits.

**Offer Flat Rates**
Another way to tackle high shipping costs is to calculate the average cost per order, and then create a general shopping rule that applies the same shipping cost to all orders, regardless of their size, distance etc. This way you can include the shipping price inside the product price, making the checkout process easier and quicker. The major disadvantage to using this method is that to some customers, such as locals or people who’ve purchased your smaller items, shipping might still be too expensive, while larger or further away orders will become cheaper.

**Setup a shipping calculator**
Shipping prices tend to change from time to time, so if you want to be transparent with your customers, you can set up a real time shipping quote calculator that takes information such as package weight, distance, and the customer’s preferred courier, and outputs a specified shipping price relevant for the day of purchase. Seeing all the data as-is will add to your reliability. However, that still doesn’t ensure that you’ll get more orders, plus getting such a feature up and running with no glitches can cost quite a bit to set up.

For traditional sellers, the process of selling would mean that one has to buy the inventories or goods, put them into a warehouse, pack them, acquire payments from customers, get FedEx to collect and track the delivery. 

With dropshipping, sellers can shun all these steps and enjoy worry-free selling experiences. This process is beneficial to the buyers too.

This helped encourage SEO and build a strong link juice on the sites that were using CM Tooltip, but the best part was yet to be revealed, and we soon realized that our baby was growing into an ultimate blogger’s money making machine!

**How can CM Tooltip help YOU make money online?**
If you’re a blogger, and if you’re registered with affiliate programs, you could be using CM Tooltip as a tool for presenting your affiliated products and promoting them across your entire website. You will not need to place any ads on your site at all, nor will you need to write long blog posts about how great those product are, because obviously, readers don’t like that. In fact, once you’re done with the initial set up of the plugin, you will not need to do anything at all!

**Settings up the foundations- How to get started**
Install and activate the CM Tooltip eCommerce edition on your WordPress blog or website
Create a new “term-page” for each of your affiliated products
Add an excerpt or a read more tag to your “terms”, to create short descriptions that will appear in the tooltip
Under “Custom related articles”, Add your unique affiliate link, directing your readers to purchasing your affiliated products
Alternatively, if you want the tooltip to link directly to an external site, add the link under “custom term link”.
Start mentioning your affiliated products in your content like you would normally do
And You’re Done!

**What will you get?**
Every time you mention a product name, a tooltip will appear upon hover-over, giving a quick overview of the product and linking over to the “term-page”, which has now been transformed into a product page.

In addition, you will see a brand new page called “Glossary”, which is generated by the plugin to index and link all of your products in an alphabetic order of either tiles or list. Links to this page will appear on every single product page.

On the product page, you can elaborate about the product, add images and videos, and even integrate an amazon API to display user-generated recommendations (if you’re an Amazon affiliate).
Finally, if you make your product page engaging enough, people will go over through your affiliate link and purchase your affiliated product, allowing you to make money online without any special efforts other than blogging!

I've come here to gather some feedback from the community. What are some of your own issues you wish you could quickly identify regarding product data feeds?

Fixing even the most minor of feed issues can vastly improve paid channel performance. There is a tool which has been launched recently from a company I often have business with. This diagnosis tool can help identify errors in product data feeds which are used across channels such as Google Shopping, Amazon, Ebay and Comparison Shopping Engines. 

###Tool Features

- Identifies broken product offer URLs (Error 404 – Page does not exist)
- Shows you which product titles and descriptions have too many characters.
- Can display information on which product offer URLs are redirecting to the wrong product.
- Provides warnings when product image URL links are broken, in the incorrect format or not displayed on white backgrounds.",5,4,2015-02-24,ECOM,0.13358420133590698,0.8378520011901855,0.028563790023326874

ecommerce,Do you need personalized product recommendations?,"I'd appreciate some opinions from ecommerce business owners:

Our solution tracks visitors' engagement data with the site, and uses it to figure out the best product recommendation for each individual based on the past and present behavior. 

Currently our technology is used for personalized retargeting, but we think that sites might benefit from a unified personalization solution which can be used across all communication channels (site widgets, email, mobile app, etc).

While there are plenty recommendations solution, the good ones are predominantly for the IR500. Also none offer a true unified / cross channel personalization platform.

From our perspective some of the clear benefits of a single solution are:

* single integration (no need to install/manage multiple services)
* Sharing data/analytics delivers improved performance
* consistent communication (no need to recommend things that were already recommended elsewhere.
* cost saving

I integrated Stripe on a client's e-commerce and after 6 purchases Stripe sent an email asking for authorization about selling certain products on the website. Basically my client deals with high-profile brands. I want to mention that my client has p/o and invoices for any of the products on the website, everything is as good as it gets.

After Stripe sent the email, my client replied asking for more information on this regard (we are also using paypal for 7 months now and this never happened) and what kind of documentation Stripe need.

Well, that was on Feb. 20, and since then Stripe has yet to respond. We are sending emails every day, meanwhile my client's funds are frozen and won't be transferred to my client's bank until he provide authorization.

What do we have to do about this ? How is it possible that when asking for info about services Stripe will reply within hours, but about this problem it won't. 8 days passed and we are more and more worried and confused because no one will help or respond.

What actions do we have to take at this point ? I tried #stripe on freenode, I searched more into this but I couldn't find anything useful.

I recently started an online business drop shipping electronic goods. Its doing quite well and I have about to hit 10k in revenue for the first month.

 My question is regarding stripe as I am using them primarily for accepting payments (I don’t use paypal as I have had horrible experiences with them in the past).


I’ve had to provide proof of ID with stripe in order for transfers to my bank account to take place, which is fine, I’ve submitted my ID and its approved. What I did read though, that there is levels of verification. Such as proving your business exists by providing an ABN (Australian business number, I’m in Aus). Currently I don’t have one and am in the middle of working that out. 

However, I cannot afford for any payments to be frozen. So I was seeing if anyone knows:
Does stripe ask for anymore verification other than id and proof you own the domain? And if so, is there a monetary limit at which they will ask for further verification, ie. 20k in sales and I will need to provide my ABN?

- Customer Groups (Regular, Wholesale)

- Custom Domain

- TLS/https

- Compliant with European tax rules

- Multiple languages (German and English are a must)

- Payment: Credit Card and Pay by invoice if you are in the wholesale customer group.
