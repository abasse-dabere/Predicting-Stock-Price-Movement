ecommerce,Online marketplace - high escrow fees? Alternatives?,"Hi all,

We are wanting to create an online marketplace for our industry where items can be bought and sold (pretty standard), but it would involve the customer receiving the item, inspecting it, and only if satisfied, sending payment to the seller (so both parties need to be happy essentially). In order to protect both parties, it seems that some form of escrow is the only solution (unless someone can propose an alternative). 

The only problem is that escrow.com (in US) or mangopay (in Europe) are the only two options I can see. We are based in the UK, but our industry deals in US dollars, which is another complexity perhaps. The main issue is the transaction fees that both these services charge. For instance, even on their lowest percentage of 0.05% of order size (for wire transfers), this still amounts to $1,250 on an item sold for $250,000. This becomes an issue because these high value items are often scarce in the market and margins are low on these as it is. For a seller to take a $1,250 haircut just because we need to charge this to cover an escrow fee is asking a lot particularly when we'd need a transaction fee of our own on top to cover our own expenses of running the marketplace. Credit card escrow fees are up to the 2-2.5% range, which is even worse, and all our customers could quite easily just use our marketplace to source the material and then conduct their regular business outside the site (as is the case right now with wire transfers directly customer to customer in the industry).

Does anyone know of a better way around this or an escrow like service that is more what we would need? Maybe we're barking up the wrong tree by even thinking about conventional systems for this.  Maybe we need to consider bitcoin or something, but that's a little outside our wheelhouse.

All thoughts appreciated.",3,3,2017-09-02,ECOM,0.030821291729807854,0.9271907210350037,0.04198792949318886
ecommerce,Looking for a designer / advice,"We run a wholesale business and are trying to sell our products directly to consumers via a Shopify website.  I have created the website with a shopify theme.  [https://phillytowel.com/](https://phillytowel.com/) We are getting okay traffic (especially since we are just starting out) around 50 hits a day.  But we are getting no conversions.  I know that our prices are in line with Amazon and big box stores or maybe a little lower but we are not getting any sales.  I have installed mouseflow to see what is going on with the visitors and almost every time they land on the page and then jump right off.  We have an average visitor duration of 40.9 seconds and an average of 1.38 pages per visitor  

So, suggestions would be helpful, but I clearly don't understand how to build a website that either A) looks good or B) people trust enough to buy from.  I don't need a super fancy website and we only have two products to sell both this two variations.  I know how to do all the back end integrations with our fulfillment operations and I am doing an OK job at getting people to the site.  Is there anyone out there who would be able to revamp our site so that we could actually get some conversions?  I can give you more product photos and whatever copy you need.

dropship,Setting up free + shipping as well as shipping zones on Shopify,I've googled search this and found a blog that kind of answered my question but If I wanted to promote a free + shipping for a product for different countries would i have to create a separate shipping zone with manually calculating the rates for each?  How would I separate one product to be free + shipping and have it not affect other products?  I've read that weight needs to be manipulated to show the product as free and then shipping rate would depend on the country's carrier.

shopify,Question about Salehoo and Dropshipping,"I am working on a Dropshipping website. I will be selling bicycles and related components. The website will run on Shopify. 
As everyone knows, finding reliable suppliers is not easy and I am staying away from Aliexpress so I started looking for suppliers/manufactors. 

I heard about Salehoo but it is a paid service so I got some questions before I decide to buy it or not. 
I know Salehoo is a database with hundreds of suppliers for dropshipping. I am focusing on EU market for now so obviously EU suppliers would be the best option for me. 

I have two questions. 

Will Salehoo tell which suppliers have a Shopify app?

Anyone knows how is the cicyling market in Salehoo? Do they provide suppliers for every single market? I dont want to buy the service to later realise it doesn't fit my area. 
Good quality photos of the bicycles is an important thing for me as well. Anyone who bought Salehoo kind enough to help with with his one?

Hello there. So I run a website and I dropship watches. This is definitely not my first shopify as I have experienced a lot of failures before. I decided to use instagram influencers to promote my free plus shipping watch.

The product costs were about $50 all together and on top of that the Shopify monthly subscription + hurrify was $33.99. I am very happy that I made sales but I am making a loss right now ( about -$38). I am currently running a $5 a day retargeting campaign on facebook ads (to target those who clicked on the site but did not buy). Can anyone give me some help or advice please. It will be much appreciated!

ecommerce,Receiving international payment (USD) to China based Paypal?,"I'm hoping someone with some experience or knowledge about China based ecommerce can help me out here. So far any search just yields information about receiving payments from Chinese customers, which is not what I'm looking for.

**The situation**: My wife (Chinese citizen) wants to register an ecommerce business here in China. It is entirely western-facing and all products are sold in USD, with customers primarily in North America and Europe. I've helped her register a company outside of China up until now.

**Problem**:  Receiving USD and withdrawing to a bank is a breeze with Paypal, but there is a $50 000 USD limit in terms of how much you can transfer to an individual in China per year (same thing going out too). She needs that money to get back to China to continue to reinvest though.

**My Question**: Is it possible to set up a Chinese Paypal account to receive payments just the same as any other and link it to a Chinese bank account? This would be significantly easier in terms of managing cash flow, and if it meant just basing the business in China, paying taxes here, etc, then I think that's a better solution. I just can't find a lot of information about running an ecommerce business from China and how to manage the cross border transactions.

Another issue I worry about is if she registered the business in China, but continued to receive funds abroad (Canada) that are then sent to China regularly (still need to figure that out) - is it possible that this could catch the CRA who might wonder why large amounts of money are drifting in and out of an account all year? We could explain it, but could that land us (let's face it, probably me) in any kind of trouble?

I'm looking to move to a new booking app for the events company I work for. We schedule monthly events and sell tickets for these on our website, roughly 50 per month.

Every booking app I've seen doesn't have this functionality.

This cloud software allows you to:

1) optimize your pricing and Google Shopping performance by automatically keeping your Shopify prices competitive with people selling the same product on Amazon/Walmart/Google Shopping and other marketplaces 2) target specific competitor's e-commerce stores by putting in the URL of a competitor's product page and adjusting your product's price to automatically beat or match the price of the product on that page.

Note: the software would always stay within your required margins (it wouldn't drop your prices below an acceptable level), it will increase your prices if your competitors are higher than you, and it would also allow you to specify a minimum price to sell your products for limitations like MAP pricing.

The reason we wanted to do this, was so that we could have more than one page that could be constructed with rich formatting components like images and text blocks, the way that you Shopify's ""Theme"" (Home) pages are.  We use this for our ""How it works"" page, which is in addition to our home page, as well as campaign specific landing pages, where I want to show different content to visitors from different sources.

A freelance Shopify developer working for us found this Hypervisual tool within the Shopify app store, which enables rich format editing without need to know code.  He then further customized the modules for our specific needs.

We now also use this for creating variants of the homepage for A-B testing.  It is possible to do this via Optimizely directly, but not if you want to test major layout changes.  So now I create clones of the homepage using Hypervisual, then use Optimizelty to switch traffic between them.

shopify,"Request for feedback! Building a free plugin to use voice (alexa, google assistant, siri) to help you sell more to your customers! What do you think matters?","Hello everybody, I'm Philipp from Berlin.

**I'm working on building a service for shopify to let shopify owners seamlessly enable ""voice-commands"" for their customers.**

**How it is supposed to work:** Our service connects with your shopify-store and builds an automated set of commands for the products which you offer. Let's take Amazon Alexa. After connecting to our service, your customers will be able to say for example:
""Hey Alexa - activate #yourshopname. Add #yourproductname to my cart.""
Or
""Hey Alexa - activate #yourshopname. Rate #yourproductname with 5 stars.

**Current Status:** Right now, we are at a hackathon in Berlin. And we started working on this service yesterday and our aim is to get the first version live until Saturday 1pm (CET). Three voice-expert developers and myself are working on this (they just came back to Germany from a 3 month stint in a New York Voice Accelerator for a different product).

We are doing this project for fun and to play around with the voice capabilities of Amazon Alexa. They opened their API for this type of work 2 days a go, so this is a bit spontaneous :)

**What we need:**
To the shopify owners out there: We are looking for your views on ""voice-shopping""! Do you see this as a relevant channel for you? Why yes, why not? Which type of actions would you like your customers to be able to do with voice? What else would you like to do with voice?It would be great to get some feedback from you guys and girls!

I think voice can really be a great way to reach tech-enthusiasts right now, and by 2020 (when all smartphones will have voice assistants, according to Gartner) voice-shopping will be everywhere!

dropship,Letting your customer know your dropship sources,"My two dropship sources are Printful and an established stationary shop that I worked out a deal with (not to be named, sorry). Since these products are printed with my designs, a customer can't go and buy directly from them. So I've been considering putting up pages about these two companies on my site. 

The reasons being:  
1. I already explain to the customers that different products come from different warehouses since they potentially pay shipping twice (I don't bake shipping into the product cost.)  
2. I think that the established nature of these two companies lends credibility to my shop. I can talk about their quality which the customer can verify since these companies are successful.

Downfalls would be that a customer could see how much I am marking up products from Printful (I only mark up $5 for each shirt) which I think I'm okay with since they're paying for a designed shirt not a blank one.

- Neither will allow me to set sales tax on some items in the bundle (physical) and not others (digital) even if I set the price of the child products
- Bundles distort reporting if you assign them a static price, as the sale is attributed to the bundle sku and not the individual items in the bundle

ecommerce,Best e-commerce solution for my store?,"Hello /r/ecommerce,

I currently have a clothing store that uses Big Cartel as its e-commerce solution.  
The monthly fee is not that expensive ($30) but I'm missing many features like multi languages, etc.  
I only have around 100 products on my store and I don't need many advanced features. I just want to be able to have a store in various languages and currencies and that supports shipping fees, expeditions, discount codes, PayPal &amp; Stripe, customer registration, customer support (tawk.to) and other basic functionalities.

I've been looking on the Internet, Reddit and many other places about what would be the best solution for me. I know HTML and CSS and I have basic notions of PHP, Twig, Sass and JavaScript. I have looked at WooCommerce and Prestashop and don't really know what to choose.

The pros of WooCommerce are that I already know Wordpress, there are lots of themes and plugins and the community is huge. But in the cons, Wordpress seems to often encounter security issues, it's not a software dedicated to e-commerce and it seems you have to supercharge your website with many extensions in order to have a proper store with all the needed functionalities.

On the other side, you have Prestashop that is dedicated to e-commerce but the community is way smaller, the themes and extensions are pretty expensive and many people are complaining about the various bugs, the slow development and the overall speed of Prestashop.

But I've also seen that around one year ago, some developers have forked the project. It's named Thirty Bees and their goal is to correct the bugs, get rid of many dependencies and start fresh with a clean code base.

Since I only need an e-commerce platform (no blog or other things), Prestashop would seem like the ideal choice but with the bugs, slowdowns and other things, WooCommerce seems more stable and friendly. And what about Thirty Bees that would seem like Prestashop without all the bugs and all?

So, should I use Prestashop to have a purely e-commerce platform with the support of the community, should I use Thirty Bees to have a *cleaner and faster* Prestashop or should I go with WooCommerce in order to have an easy and friendly solution with all the ressources and support from the community that goes along?

If anyone could help me, that would be much appreciated!

dropship,Thoughts on Ali Dropshipping Plugin,"I am starting to read up on drop shipping. Currently I have a small store on eBay and have made a few drop ship sales (less than 10), i believe partially due to the very competitive market i am selling in - watches. I am doing this partially because I like watches and have some understanding of them and generally which ones to look for.

I plan to open my own website (and when I turn 18 also sell on amazon) and have discovered this plugin for drop shipping called Alidropship. I don't know whether I am allowed to post links to external business so if not then please let me know, but [here](https://alidropship.com/plugin/) is their website. 

I was hoping to gain some more info on what exactly it does, and whether it is worth buying ($89 one time fee), or whether it isn't too hard to just learn the skills myself. They seem to be pretty legit - i got a pretty decent PDF book from them which basically helps you understand drop shipping and how to find a niche and things like that.

tl;dr: Is Ali dropship plugin worth buying

dropship,How to Keep Your Branding When Dropshipping,"Hi everyone,

Major newbie over here; thanks for your patience with the amateur question.

I'd like to launch a dropshipping business, but I'm wondering - if I use dropshipping - wouldn't the dropshipping supplier that I go through send the product using their own company name? Which would mean that the customer would be able to see for themselves that I'm essentially just a middleman, and go directly to the supplier next time they buy.  

A business model where I was shipping out my inventory myself would allow me to nicely package my product, with my brand's presence on full display by way of the boxing, tags, etc. But with dropshipping, are you essentially just forgoing your delivery package branding in lieu of more convenient shipping fulfillment benefits?

Would love to hear how you all go about with this - thanks a bunch.",12,7,2017-09-11,ECOM,0.03433304280042648,0.9308083653450012,0.034858573228120804

shopify,"Stay Away From Shopify For Health, and Beauty related Items","I'm going to catch a lot of flak for this, but hear me out. This isn't even a guaranteed stay away, but I want to let people know potential issues that you will be dealing with when you sell on Shopify. Now don't get me wrong, all shopping carts have issues, but shopify's issue is with their Risk department which is a bit unusual.

As you know shopify charges transaction fee's from 0.5 - 2%, unless you pay for Shopify Plus, which this will not apply.

I have switched to shopify and have spent a lot of money switching my platform to shopify. I've called them up several times to make sure everything would be okay, I wanted to process using Shopify Payments so I wouldn't have to pay the 2% transaction fee, I sent my ID, and all the documents they requested, and now they send me this generic message.

&gt; Hello,

&gt;Max from the Risk Operations Team,

&gt;We value your business at Shopify but it looks like you are selling a product we can't support on the Shopify Payments Gateway as it violates the Shopify Payments [Terms of Service](https://www.shopify.ca/legal/terms-payments-us). We are unable to accept payments for pseudo pharmaceuticals (meaning any product that makes a health claim including things like supplements, vitamins, as outlined here here

&gt;We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We will pay out any current balance to your bank account and you can continue to use Shopify to power your business, but you will need to change to a different payment gateway in order to process payments for the products/services you currently offer.

&gt;You will not be able to process payments until you add a new payment gateway. You might want to think about using Authorize.net in conjunction with a merchant services account from National Discount Merchant Services to see if they are able to help you to continue to process payments for your business- you can reach them via phone at 310 359 9091. You can also reach out to any of the integrated payment gateways available to Shopify merchants and listed here to see if they can process payments for your business.

&gt;We understand the inconvenience this may cause, and we’re here to answer any questions you may have.

&gt;Regards,
&gt;Max
&gt;Risk Analyst | Shopify

Now, a few complaints that I have are:

1 - Their terms of service never mention that.

2 - This includes ALL supplements and Vitamins. Even though their wording says one thing, they do something completely different. It does not matter if you do not make a health claim, they see it as all the same.

3 - They don't actually give you a real response, they just give you curt generic responses.

ecommerce,How I built &amp; launched an e-commerce clothing store. For free.,"I wrote a blog post on it via Medium which has links and pictures to make it a little more exciting but anyhow:

Well, it started with frustration. And no, I’m not talking about building the store. I’m talking about how frustrated I was with the shit quality of clothing out there. I’d buy some shirts for cheap and they’d be ruined after 5 washes. I also couldn’t find shirts that I liked looking at. I always ended up buying packs of blank shirts. It got boring. Not only for me, but probably also for the people looking at me.
I had always wanted my own clothing line but just had no idea what it would be or what the idea behind it would be. It was earlier this year when my clothing line idea was sparked. But that’s another story.

Finding a supplier

O.K. so I wanted to build my own e-commerce clothing store. First thing I did was test out some shirts. I looked up a t-shirt guy in the area and hit him up. My number one priority at this point was to test the quality and sizing. Was the shirt going to fit how I wanted it to? Did it feel nice? Was the shirt going to shrink awkwardly? Was the shirt going to deteriorate after a couple washes? I checked out a bunch of cheaper shirts and tried them on. NOPE! The t-shirt guy then told me about another, more expensive brand but he didn’t have any in stock. In addition, one of my biggest mistakes — I ordered 4 test shirts with vinyl print. What. A. F***ing. Mistake. (Down below I share how to get sample shirts for CHEAP). The fit was terrible and the vinyl print melted in the dryer.

That cost me 200 f***ing dollars. You know what’s great about mistakes though? You learn from them (well, most of us do).
After this t-shirt guy lost all credibility, I found another local shop nearby. I went in and tried on as many shirts as I could. I also inquired about their more expensive shirts but quickly turned them down when they mentioned the cost per shirt ($20+). I bought a couple blank shirts (more expensive) and wore them, washed them, dried them, and ultimately, tested them. Dissatisfied. I put that process on hold to see if I could figure something out with a drop shipper online.

Development Background / Hosting

Before I continue, a quick background on my development experience. I took a full-time Front End Web Development bootcamp in Toronto (at HackerYou). I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Wordpress and a ton more. But what I really learned was HTML, CSS &amp; Wordpress and not so much of the JavaScript part (seemed to have a hard time making sense of it). After graduation, I never worked full-time as a Web Developer. However, I did do some freelance work with Wordpress. Since I am a developer, I already have a hosting account with InMotion (they’re awesome) and I can host as many sites as I like. **Disclaimer — I DID pay about $15 for my domain name with Hover (they’re awesome as well).

E-Commerce Platform

It was time to find an e-commerce platform. I know people think Shopify is everybody’s Lord and saviour but if you’re cheap (or smart with money like me ;)) then you’ll find a more cost effective way. And that’s what I did. I found out that if I built a Wordpress site, I could integrate WooCommerce and one of their themes to make it look and act like a store. I could then integrate with Paypal and/or Stripe using a simple plugin to handle payments. I opted for Stripe mainly because the customer doesn’t need an account to make a purchase (FYI — both of their transaction fees are 2.9% + $0.30).

While doing a considerable amount of research, I found out that Printful (which is a popular drop shipper) integrated with WooCommerce. Again, I just downloaded it as a plugin and then linked my Prinftul account to my WooCommerce store. I have nothing but great feedback for Printful,
1. If you get stuck, they have numerous videos on YouTube that help you troubleshoot, sync products or integrate Printful with WooCommerce.
2. They have on-demand customer service via instant messaging on their site.
3. You can order samples from them for 20% off.
4. They have more than just t-shirts. They also have mugs, socks, pillows, towels &amp; more…

Security

I really didn’t want anyone to have to worry about the security of their personal information and therefore managed to obtain a free SSL certificate using the Cloudflare plugin. Basically what an SSL Certificate does is convert ‘http’ to ‘https’ and typically costs around $99/year.

My Takeaways (and hopefully yours)

1. Do not partner with a local shop (it’s expensive and you’ll most likely need to order in bulk)
2. DO partner with a drop shipper (it’s cheaper and they have the ability to print and ship one product at a time)
3. If you have a friend who’s a developer, see if they’ll host the site for you. Take them out for dinner or somethin!
4. Go to a t-shirt store (or whatever products you want to sell) and try them on. This is the cheapest way to test. And if you’re still unsure, get a sample order from Printful testing different brands.

I remember thinking a couple years back how cool it would be to have my own e-commerce clothing store…aaaannnnddd now I do. Overall, it was pretty simple and it cost me nothing but time. Now I just have to learn how to market it for free :)

Hope you enjoyed and hope it helps you build your own e-commerce store. Feel free to ask any questions!

edit: Relax, people. I just wanted to write about how I built an e-commerce store for basically 2 reasons - 1) I hope at least one person can learn at least one thing from my experience. And 2) I'm pretty proud of myself for building it. I'm not trying to encourage, promote or sell anything. I'm simply sharing a personal experience that I believe can help someone.",6,3,2017-09-14,ECOM,0.035276918672025204,0.9155763983726501,0.04914666526019573

ecommerce,The social media trends you need to know to sell more online this holiday season,"I've spent the past 2 weeks collecting data, scouring the web for resources and figuring out what ecommerce entrepreneurs have to be doing with their social media presences this season to sell more online. 

Here's what I came up with:

Video marketing: 

Particularly making use of vertical video, which is this season's major trend. Why? Because vertically (on your phone), the video takes up more space on your screen than a horizontally filmed video, which will fit to the width of your screen. 
 
HubSpot stated that 50% of consumers look for a brand's video content before buying something from that online store. Think about that. And then go make some veritcal videos. 

Personalized advertising:

Use Facebook's Dynamic Product retargeting. Segment the hell out of your lists. Create custom audiences based on factors like geography and demographics. An easy win: sent your Canadians a Thankgiving special - Canadian thanksgiving is Oct. 9th this year. 

Disappearing stories:

Paricularly Instagram stories. They have crazy high engagement, and Tim Ferriss said that the ""swipe up"" feature (available for verified accounts only) yielded higher conversions for his book sales than any other marketing tactic, including Facebook live. 

I wrote it all even more in depth for the Printful blog if you want to check that out. But I thought I'd share my main findings here with you guys.",3,3,2017-09-15,ECOM,0.025597592815756798,0.9374330043792725,0.0369693897664547

I'm having alot of trouble trying to get emails to be sent after someone places an order. I have tried everything I can find through google but still having no luck. So far it sends emails to users after they've made a purchase, but it doesn't notify us when someone has placed an order.

So far I've tried to switch the email, from our custom handle info@websitename.com over to gmail, orders.website@gmail.com

I've tried using postman STMP and set that up but still no luck.

shopify,Merchants Affected by Chargebacks and Shopify Admin Needs to Read This Post.,"Full Disclosure; this post makes for a slightly lengthy read but it is necessary to get my point across. If the details do not apply to you, please move on. If however, you find the details apply to you, then please focus on discussing solutions. 

The Perpetrators: Chargebacks have come to plague many stores on a daily basis and the customers get emboldened daily. It is no longer limited to High Risk Orders but also includes Low Risk orders that are approved by Chargeback Protection Services. This opens a whole new window of opportunity for anyone to simply make a purchase online, wait for their item to arrive and then open a chargeback, enabling them to keep the money and the item. This clearly places the Merchant in a lose-lose situation with no recourse. I liken the position of the Merchants to that of a sitting duck, certain the hit can (and will) come from anywhere regardless of whether it be a Low, Medium or High Risk Order. Merchants now come to refer to it as the ""cost of doing business"" but it begs the question how long will this persist and how long before that cost frustrates you to the point that you can no longer afford the cost of inventory?

Chargeback Protection Services: The promise of securing your business from fraud and Chargebacks is a boat any Merchant who has experienced chargebacks would readily jump into with the hope that the chargeback nightmare would be over and all their troubles taken care of by subscribing to a Chargeback Proction Service provider in exchange for parting with a percentage of each sale. It's easy math to do and an easy decision to make as any hesitation you may have had is replaced with frenetic clamour the first time you have to deal with a chargeback on your own.

Unfortunately, my experiencae has indicated to me that current Chargeback Protection Companies (I have used more than two) do not help (and i say this with no malice or negative intent towards them). MY experience has led me to believe that their business does not protect/prepare them for actual Chargebacks when they occur and they can only take so many hits before it becomes unprofitable for them to support your store and meet up to their commitment/promise that led you to subscribe in the first place. Let's face it, how can they protect you if they have no protection to offer?

The Almighty Banks: We're all customers but the category of customers that influence decisions are not Merchants for the simple fact that we are a very small category when compared to the everyday individual customers (which we as Merchants are also part of when you're not wearing your Entrepreneur's hat). Policies have to be made that are more suitable to ""everyone"". This means that Banks guarantee safety in credit card use to customers and live up to that commitment by taking potshots at the helpless ducks.  

The Shopify Platform: Shopify has irrevocably changed the face of e-commerce and I don't know if you have been following up on their growth in the stock exchange, but you should know the platform has grown immensely. Their growth is largely due to their unique service: making it possible for ANYONE who has the slightest ember of aspiration for owning their own online business to do so. Forget looking up the stock exchange news (I know you're too busy running your e-commerce store), you may notice that wait time for chatting with a Shopify Guru has gone from you waiting in a queue of 3 to now having to wait with 70 to 100 other merchants on the virtual queue before you're attended to. My point, however, is not about the queue. My point is, regarding Charge-backs, Shopify can only play the role of a spectator. Of course, when you're too busy to respond to a charge-back, there's a system set in place to submit whatever information is available on the order such as tracking details, etc. That is as far as Shopify's involvement goes. I must mention that Shopify's Guru will also readily and effectively direct you on ""HOW"" to respond to a charge-back when you need help to do so.
  
The Merchants: The reason i left this Player as last is not because i am saving the best for last. It is because the Merchants are the last player to get consideration (if any). The Merchants are the true victims of e-commerce credit card fraud. The Merchant is excited to receive an order, then he pauses to see if there's a red or orange caution sign on the order and if you have a charge-back service you go to see what the verdict is (more often than not, the verdict is the same as the one provided by Shopify Fraud Analysis). If you don't have a charge-back protection service, then you go through your internal review of the order trying to determine whether to cancel or decide that the order may be legitimate and the high risk report is wrong (this type of reasoning soon stops after a series of High Risk orders you took a chance on results in chargebacks). In the positive outcome that you see a green light and everything ""looks"" good, you prepare your order, ship out the item, and get your payout... until the day the hammer drops on you in the form of an open charge-back notification. You go to check it and it's a Low Risk order so you know someone is sitting somewhere and having a laugh at your misfortune and getting one over on you while moving on to the next unsuspecting Merchant. So you submit a charge-back and state all the facts as you know it despite knowing in the back of your mind that you'd be surprised if the bank decided in your favor. The loop continues. Does this sound familiar to you? (It would really suck if this experience is unique to my store wouldn't it). Well moving on... 

Having been a victim of this too many times, I decided to direct my energy towards some constructive thinking for possible solution. Unfortunately, me alone on my work desk cannot do anything about it and the key word here is ""alone"". Merchants need help and we cannot individually help ourselves because the elements involved are simply not within our control once a chargeback is opened. 

Some of the Top Solutions I came up with are stated in bullet points below: 

* A Chargeback Protection Service that can actually work with credit card companies/Banking industry

* Charge Merchants for Chargeback protection service

* Set up an escrow account that holds the deducted chargeback while a claim is being investigated

* Actually have the issue investigated so that repeat offenders who actually prey on Merchants are documented and denied credit card for a period of time (too much? or too myopic a solution? I don't know i'm not a banker)

* Credit card companies/banks set in place an authentication process such as OTP for customers to use with their credit card online. This limits the possibility for someone to simply use your credit card because they have the card details. They'll need the phone where the OTP is sent or your email details or whatever smarter delivery method for the OTP (Is this too much? Am I not seeing the bigger picture?)

* This will ensure customers are not worried sick when their credit/debit card goes missing unless their phone is missing too or their email account has been compromised. 

* This limits the amount of ecommerce fraud, distributes the responsibilty amongst players, allows the Merchants business to have one less issue to deal with and overall makes ecommerce platform safer for all parties involved. And yes, it trickles down to everyone and overall economic growth (don't let me get started on that topic). 

These bullet points were made for easy consumption but, of course, we all get the picture i'm trying to paint here don't we? 

This got me thinking of the many legitimate arguments that can be made against this solution. However, one cannot deny the fact that something needs to be done to fix this gap that affects Merchants who currently do not have a collective voice. One argument that i had a quick answer to was ""WHO"" the service provider could be? The response to that was ""there are many"" entrepreneurs, insurance companies, even existing Charge-back Service Companies and as we know, it is impossible to have a monopoly over such services. That doesn't mean we can't find a company uniquely suited for liaising between the financial institutions and the all the key players.

The most obvious who could provide this service is, Shopify. Shopify is currently inextricably connected to all the major players, most importantly the merchants. They are in the best position considering they single-handedly have the largest platform for Merchants. Merchants, such as the ones affected most by this situation, are individually responsible for payments in the current solution. The continued success of current and future eCommerce merchants coming onboard the Shopify platform should no doubt, be a very important factor atop the list of interests for Shopify. 

DISCLAIMERS: 
This post is not meant as an attack on any party or an invitation to open a platform to negatively discuss any of the players mentioned above. It is for the sole purpose of discussing solutions on chargebacks and hopefully bring it to the attention of Shopify. 

This post is influenced by my experience and may not apply to anyone who has not experienced chargebacks. 

This post is made in the hopes that some form of solution can actually begin to take shape that will benefit stakeholders even if it's made up of mostly Shopify (present and future) merchants.

dropship,Would someone be willing to help me a little?,"Hello, i wish that you are having a splendid day. I am set on starting my Shopify store and go on in my e-commerce adventure very soon, and i really need to make it work, because it would go really dark for me if i don't, and i am willing to put whatever effort that needs to be put. 
I, as everybody who starts, have watched as many youtube videos as there is, and now have extended my quest for knowledge even further on reddit. I have chosen my niche, which is cats by the way, because i absolutely love them. And i have come to assume that starting with the ""Free+ shipping"" model is optimal since it does seem to provide a willingness to buy on the customer's perspective that wouldn't otherwise exist. 
However, i have , through personal experience, come to question the many of what the self-proclaimed charlatans claim. I have tried once to make money on Kindle, and i was soul-crushingly disheartened by the results. 
They all rely on convincing you through the sheer fact that the pot is just stupendous, that astronomically tiny numbers of it would make you more than you had hoped. 
Seldom does that happen i think, or maybe it was just my case. Therefore i would like to ask if anyone would be gracious enough to give me some of their most appreciated time and offer me guidance? at least through the lunching phase. 
I seek only to gain around 500$ a month from this, if more, i would be extremely delighted. 
I don't want to make all the millions that they keep tossing around in those Youtube videos :D. Just 500$ would be so sweet( please, don't think that i am not ambitious, cause i am). 
Whoever would be kind enough to decide and offer me their advice, they firstly shall receive my eternal and undiminishable gratitude. Along with strict obedience and a mind that is quick to learn. 
If you had read up until this point, then your time and attention are much appreciated. 
I just want to make this money to buy myself some good education. The supreme goal and dream which i live solely to achieve. In case you ever wondered for my reasons.

ecommerce,Beginning SEO for e-commerce interview with Cyrus Shepard formerly head of SEO at Moz,"Today we have the first in a series of interviews we are conducting over the next several weeks about SEO and e-commerce with some of the most prominent members of the SEO community. Today’s interview is with Cyrus Shepard, he used to be the content and SEO director for Moz and is now a consultant and owner of Fazillion Media. If you have any questions or want clarification on anything, comment below.

Our questions are in bold and his answers follow in regular text.

**What percentage of time would you recommend for new e-commerce sites to focus onsite versus off site for their SEO strategy?**
80%. It’s a high number, and I mean by that is “get your house in order” first before tackling external marketing. The problem with most new e-commerce sites is low engagement, poor site architecture, and other SEO problems. While these are issues you never stop improving upon, I hate asking visitors to my site when it’s a sub-par experience.


At the same time, you need a minimal amount of traffic for testing. PPC is good for this validation stage (and beyond). Once you get your engagement numbers to a place where you know your site isn’t a total embarrassment, that’s the perfect time to expand outreach.

**Do you have any tips for smaller e-commerce sites trying to rank against the bigger players like Amazon and Ebay when they sell the same products?**
Yes! Amazon uses a standard template for products so it’s actually quite easy to differentiate yourself, but it can take a lot of effort. The most obvious areas merchants can add unique value to their product pages are:

Product videos – This is your secret weapon. Set up an in-house studio and start producing short but high quality review videos that show actual people demonstrating the product, product size, options, etc. This vastly increases user engagement and has the side benefit of increasing sales. Also, your competitors can’t copy it.
Text descriptions
Photography
Reviews


**Do you think every e-commerce site needs a blog?**
Blogs can be a big waste of time if they feel perfunctory or simply exist as a goal on the junior marketer’s annual review. The truth for 90% of small businesses is that nobody wants to read your blog, and nobody certainly wants to link to it.

But!… if you create something truly great to share, you should do so. E-commerce sites need to realize that the content they create has to compete with the top content out there for attention. If you feel your post deserves to rank #1 in the SERPs, then go for it! If instead, you approach writing blog posts the same way you do writing your Aunt Erma on her birthday, you may want to rethink your strategy.


**What is your feeling on using JSON + LD in a SEO strategy? If you are for it, how far do you recommend going?**

Personally, I mark up everything I can. If limited on time, I find the smartest strategy is to search for my product on Google, and see what rich snippets my competitors have won for the SERP. Then make sure you have the same type of markup.

Certain JSON-LD markup types are a given, such as product, reviews, business info, etc.

**How important do you think site speed is to an e-commerce sites SEO strategy?**
Site speed is always in the top 3 things of everything you should work on, no matter what. E-commerce sites can get particularly bogged down with poor shopping cart software, plugins, tracking code and the like. It’s not even primarily a ranking consideration with me. The correlation between conversions (sales) and site speed is so pronounced on every site I’ve ever worked on, it would be malpractice not to continually address it.


**Do you have an opinion on using Google AMP for e-commerce sites?**
Right now, e-commerce sites don’t get much extra visibility for using AMP, so the primary benefit is speed, which you can accomplish easier in other ways.

That said, Google is pulling more and more AMP pages into it’s maw, so it’s something to keep an eye out for.

**What are your suggestions for starting a link building strategy for a new e-commerce site?**
First tackle the low-hanging fruit: Legitimate industry directories, trade shows, sponsorships, trade organizations, and local listing distribution. Even if you don’t have local locations, you should at least get your headquarters distributed using something like Moz Local.

After that, it’s all about PR. This will depend on the specific product offering, and it’s significantly more challenging than the low-hanging fruit. It’s also where most e-commerce sites fail.


**Do you feel social media has an impact on a sites rankings?**
The answer is “yes, but it’s complicated.” The short answer is to drive relevant traffic to your site through all channels, and this can have a positive–albeit nuanced–effect on your organic search traffic. Typically, there’s no need to go crazy on social media investment. Be smart.",11,6,2017-09-18,ECOM,0.04500287026166916,0.925995409488678,0.029001746326684952

Shopify recently pulled their plugin on WP, and now only offer a buy now button. As we have several hundred items to sell, does anyone know an easier way to integrate these items without creating hundreds of listings? Apologies if this has been discussed, I searched and only found questions relating to Shopify vs WP, none about plugin integration.",6,3,2017-09-19,ECOM,0.0272710882127285,0.9272324442863464,0.045496441423892975

ecommerce,Read Before You Post - Concerning Bannings,"You old-timers here remember the sub the way it was a few years back - the entire front page of our sub was nothing but promotions - use this service, check out my site, try this platform, etc.  You couldn't find any useful information due to the spam. 

We got feedback from you all and changed the rules to the sidebar rules you see now.   Lately mods have seen an increase in spam attempts yet again.  Many post in blatant violation of the rules, while others attempt subtle side-stepping of the rules, with no history or interest in any type of positive contribution to our sub.  Typically a user will be warned, but I see now that is mostly pointless, because those who do it are mostly throwaways.  We instituted an automod rule where new accounts had to wait 48 hrs before making a post, so now throwaways will wait about a month and post anyway.  

Such accounts will be banned without warning.  Sometimes this will catch an innocent poster who made a simple mistake, and they can easily message us for an appeal.  I work through the mod queue regularly, and it is getting deeper and deeper with spam crap.  A more hardline approach is, in my belief, justified and needed.

This won't affect most any of you regulars, and I know I speak for the other mods as well when I say that we appreciate your continuing to report such posts and users.  

Spam, after all, is only good on a sandwich. . .

TL/DR - Read and abide by sidebar rules or be banned

**EDIT - In case you are on mobile and they may be difficult to see, here is a copy of the sidebar rules -** 



**RULES** - This is a self-post only sub.

1 - **Please do not link to sites or blogs within your post content.** Linking to your site for review or for examples of specific issues is allowed and encouraged. Other than sites for review or specific issue examples, please post any other links in the comments section.

2 - **Do not post promotional content here as it will be reported as spam and removed.** Occasionally we will have a sticky post for just such submissions.

3 - **Be polite to each other.** When reviewing a site for a user, please be civil and constructive. Do not attack, harass, or stalk other users. Violation of this rule will result in an immediate ban.

4 - **Disclose your affiliation** If you are affiliated with a company or service that you are discussing, it is proper form to disclose that information for the benefit of all readers.

5 - **No selling of stores.** r/ecommerce is not the place to sell your existing ecommerce store. Under no circumstance do we allow users to post their stores for sale here. Those types of posts are best directed to r/entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, or offsite. Users who violate this rule will be banned, due to the risk of fraud and dishonesty it causes.

shopify,Combining Printful shirts and an item from a different source?,"I want to have a Shopify site that sells Printful shirts as well as a single small ""accessory"" that would come from a different source (probably Alibaba?).

I could get an order from Printful sent to me and the accessory sent to me, and ship it out myself,  but I'd really like to be able to have Printful print the shirts on demand instead of the upfront cost of buying in bulk (the accessory is cheap I could bulk order that up front).
I've tried to look into a fulfillment center but they seem to have pretty steep fees for such a low margin item, plus with shipping from Printful to the fulfillment center, then shipping to the customer, it would get expensive right? Plus doesn't solve my issue of needing to bulk order up front.

ecommerce,So I SOLD my tee shirt business...,"I've been working on a tee shirt brand for the past two years. I didn't make a million dollars like I had dreamed... so I sold it. 


I sold my business because I didn't have the time or money to scale it quickly. Someone who loved my brand, reached out to me and made me an offer. I feel he could take it to the next level so I'll chalk it up as a win.


If you want to start a a million dollar ecommerce empire you start a tee shirt business right? Thats what I read, so I went for it. However, the only profit I made was when I sold the brand. Was it a complete failure and waste of time? HELL NO. I'm glad I did. And if you have a tee business I encourage you to keep going. Read on...


I learned a TON about ecommerce by starting my own tee shirt brand. I developed an idea - turned it into a real brand - built a sexy &amp; functional ecommerce website - created a following of passionate fans - all things you DONT learn in class or reading a book. 


A tee shop is the perfect business to start. By ""START"" I mean - get a shop up and running and learn BUSINESS. For sub 100 bucks you can jump on Shopify create a storefront and integrate with a manufacture to make your tees, and create a legitimate business. I'm sure some have made a lot of money, but I bet many more just give up.

  
HERE is what I learned by starting a tee shirt business...

  
- DONT advertise. Don't waste money advertising in the beginning. Bootstrap. Don't spend any money until you have the perfect product, know your audience, and have learned the most efficient way to reach them. 

  
- TEST. Before you order 500 tee's of a design you love, test it. I printed a HUGE (and expensive) run of my first design. It was also my worst selling design. Try your designs DTG first, if you find a hit then order a large run - its the only way to make any real margins. 


- KNOW your audience. Think your tee's are made for 20 something males? Prove it. I thought the same thing until all my orders where coming from 30-40 year old women. Design &amp; test. 

  
- ASK QUESTIONS. Ask your audience what they think of a design, or a color, or the weather in Florida. They are honest and honesty brings sales, not guessing or magic. 



- ENGAGE. Jump on social media and talk to people. Don't just talk about your tees or products. Talk about current events. You will find SO much inspiration and make so many valuable relationships by engaging with real people. 


- GIVE. The apparel business has changed. Its no longer a luxury or limited industry. Find a charity or social initiative and give to it. People appreciate this like you would not believe. Also, GIVE your tee's to people in exchange for an opinion, review, or just cause - I'm not just talking influencers, but real people. They will tell EVERYONE and not expect anything in return. ""Hey - I see you follow and like our posts. I love your style and would love to send you a tee. If you like it, leave a review and tell your friends.""


I'm sure there are a hundred other things to mention. I'd love to hear what others have learned starting a tee shirt business....",21,24,2017-09-21,ECOM,0.028009867295622826,0.9379880428314209,0.03400212526321411

Everyone was always saying that it is oversaturated already and it's not worth it. So I actually just said screw it, and there was a moment of realization about the fact that it's just the work that you put into **ANY** of these ways to make money that matters. 

I won't get into many details if there is no interest in the project overall but I can say that I now own my first e-commerce shop! :) 

I have been living, breathing and sleeping Shopify and drop shipping for the last few weeks. I believe I got to a point of creating a somewhat trustworthy looking shop where people would not be afraid to put in their credit card information.... 

However being the only customer of my shop at this point I was looking for some feedback on it and this community just hopped into my mind because I see great people here who are not afraid of helping beginners. So any discussion just regarding this topic or Your honest feedback on the shop would be greatly appreciated.

shopify,"Shopify Just Changed The Terms of Their Partner Program Removing Payments To Partners, Forces Everyone To Accept","No more commissions on referral's credit card fees collected by Shopify....even from previous referrals.  You MUST **keep selling for Shopify** to collect the referral monies owed *previously.*   You need to sign someone new up every 12 months minimum to retain your earnings.

Shopify has the nerve to write:  *Full transparency keeps us honest.*

Here is the email they sent:

&gt; Today, we’re launching the Shopify Partner Program 2.0 — a reimagined partner program that prioritizes long-term investment back into you, our partners.

&gt;Not only have we launched a new look and feel to the program (which will roll out later this week), we’re also introducing new features, and doubling down on providing you all the tools, resources, care, and support you need on your journey to success.

&gt;If your goal is to start or expand your business, enhance the quality of your clients, or simply make more money, we’re here to help you get there.

&gt;Here are the most important things you need to know:

&gt;Improved 24/7 Priority Partner Support

&gt;Instead of a Partner Manager, you’ll now work closely with our specially trained, 24/7 Priority Partner Support team to troubleshoot any questions you may have. As a Shopify Partner, you’ll be bumped to the top of the queue whenever you reach out to support.

&gt;Here’s how to get in touch with our Priority Partner Support:

&gt;Help Centre: help.shopify.com/partners
&gt;Phone: 1-866-752-0324
&gt;Email: partnersupport@shopify.com
&gt;Live Chat: Within your Partner Dashboard
&gt;Once you’ve achieved three development store referrals, you’ll earn a Growth Coach — a personal Shopify contact whose sole job is to help you maximize your business, win more projects, and guide you on the journey to becoming an ecommerce expert.

&gt;Revenue share updates

&gt;As of October 1 2017, we’re implementing a new plan to encourage partners to remain active in our Partner Ecosystem. After a merchant referral, you’ll have 12 months to work with us again before your revenue share from previous referrals resets to zero.

&gt;For every development store you create that becomes a paid Shopify plan, you’ll continue to earn 20% monthly recurring revenue share on their subscription fees, as long as the merchant stays on a paid plan, and as long as you remain active in the Partner Ecosystem.

&gt;There are multiple ways you can remain active in the Partner Ecosystem to preserve your revenue share, including:

&gt;Development store referrals
&gt;Affiliate link referrals
&gt;Upgrading an existing merchant to Shopify Plus
&gt;Don’t worry — you have a full 12 months to carry out one of these activities before your existing revenue share payments could change.

&gt;Additionally, merchant transaction fees will no longer be included in the monthly recurring revenue share, after October 1, 2017.

&gt;For more details, read our updated How to earn documentation. If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, reach out to us at partnerfeedback@shopify.com.

Unfortunately, I rely on them to market and sell my products accounting for probably 80% of sales. We have tried using other forms of marketing, however shopping adwords is the #1 conversion performer. 

The problem though - is that because we rely on them so much they have full control of our business. And when things go wrong we can't do anything about it.

For the third time in a year our Merchant account has been suspended without any warning. All three suspensions have been through violations which we are not guilty of. Twice for not having a refund policy - we had a refund policy clearly shown on the website. We actually used Googles wording/suggestions the first time to prevent it happening again. Today we have been suspended because: Account suspended due to policy violation: no online purchasing means

We have several payment options across our checkout. All of them have been functioning just fine up until this point. It is not a complex checkout with an easy flow, 2 clicks. 

My problem with them is that no warning is issued. It's a ruthless shut down. Followed by up to two weeks of unhelpful communication through a team that have no actual influence on pushing the issue forward. They have a ""specialist team"" who are only special at avoiding work. The loss in revenue takes months to recover. If you ask them for a case review after the problem is resolved, they can not offer any information. I think it's purely because Google are in the wrong and they have no real reasons for the account suspension.

If this has happened to you, how do you handle the hit on your business? What other forms of marketing do you use, that actually have product sales results? 

Last note: How much longer can Google get away with this? Surely they are causing a lot of damage, especially to small businesses.",6,8,2017-09-28,ECOM,0.5966957807540894,0.38293758034706116,0.020366674289107323
shopify,New Shopify app launching tomorrow enticing social sharing - details,"Hey folks!  

First off, I am NOT an app developer, nor do I work for this company and I'm not compensated for anything here.  I was a beta tester in this app (and have been using Shopify for 5+ yrs), and think it is freaking awesome so I wanted to share it with you including a pre-reg link for trial &amp; reduced pricing.

* **App:** Revenue Ripple
* **Developers:** Buzz Behind
* **Type:** Marketing
* **Pricing:** Free to try, Promo $19.95/mo
* **Link:** https://revenueripple.com/prelreg  or https://apps.shopify.com/revenue-ripple

**What is it?**  RR is a 'social sharing' app for Shopify.

**What does it do?** RR entices customers to share their purchase or your company (whichever you configure, and can be configured per-product) with one of their social networks IN EXCHANGE for a discount (which you set up) or free shipping (again, defined by you).  Discount is automatically applied after the app verifies the social share was made.

**How does it work?** The easiest way would be to just look at my site - https://manelinehaircare.com - but once you add an item to the cart, a slide-out will appear showing Free Shipping or your Discount, as well social media icons for FB, Twitter, G+, Pinterest and LinkedIn.  Once the buyer clicks on the social sharing button for the network they choose, the discount is automatically applied to the cart.

**Why/What's the big deal?** Getting clients to share their purchase with their friends (or your company) is absolute GOLD when it comes to 'advertising'.  Most of us are already paying to market to the friends of our clients, but with this coming FROM the client himself, it has SOCIAL VALIDATION.  And that is something you just cannot buy.

Further, most everyone is giving away discounts and/or free shipping, but have no idea as to whether that discount is causing sales to close.  This app clears it up.

I'm a small guy in e-com, and currently have a 24% completion rate for people using Revenue Ripple on my site.  It is DEFINITELY working.  I'm getting sales from friends of my clients, and that is a big deal for me.  Revenue Ripple claims 50+% improvements, and before they could be approved in the Shopify app store, they had to PROVE this to shopify. 

At the end of the day, this app generates more sales for me than 5-10x the cost of it in PPC advertising.  I think this is going to be a game-changer.

Also, RR just emailed me an offer for Reddit including a webinar and app discounts.  Just for you!

ecommerce,New eCommerce - Pet Supply (Spain) / Review,"Hi!

I just launched my first ecommerce and I would like to have some feedback from you. The website is: http://www.mascootienda.com It's a pet supply ecommerce. I already did a few sales, about 20 but is far to be profitable.

I tried to sell this product doing FB video ads: https://mascootienda.com/collections/frontpage/products/anti-spill-out-design-dog-feeding-water-bottle-outdoor-sport-travelling-kettle-bowl-drinking-plastic-pet-products-newest

and also this one:

https://mascootienda.com/products/limpiador-de-patas

For the first one I had a few sales but the clicks were too expensive. People in the comments like it but they finally don't buy it. Even they ask where to buy it. Strange.. The purchase rate was about 1.5%

For the second product, the CTR of the video ad is crazy, about 15%. I'm buying clicks with the min price that facebook allow, 0.01.

so, I'm having a lot of clicks but people is not adding the item into the cart... what is the problem? the audience? the page? the ad? the price? How can I check it?

The ad is a video that explains very well how it works, and people is watching it with average of 50%... so... they are supposed to understand the product.

Still I have a lot of tests to do, but I will appreciate your feedback.

ecommerce,Facebook/Insta Ads Listening To Your Conversations?,"After a couple of odd ""coincidences"" I've been keeping a close eye on Facebook and Instagram Ads and how they relate to conversations I've had within earshot of my phone. I'm starting to feel like it's not coincidence and wondered if anyone else is having similarly targeted ads? 

Examples: 

Someone tells me about Aveeno hand cream for eczema. I didn't Google or search it in any way. A day later I have a FB ad for Aveeno. 

I was telling a friend about a home brand I purchased from years ago and the nice stuff I bought. I've not shopped on their website for years and then I suddenly see an advert on Insta for them. 

Just this evening I'm talking to a friend about drinking Smirnoff Ice's when we were younger. Lo and behold...an ad from Smirnoff appears in my Insta feed. 

A colleague joked ""no wonder I'm single"" and a few hours later they had an ad from match.com. 

I told my husband that I bought the wrong size industrial bar for my ear and then FB has an advert with an earring sizing guide! 

I know that Siri listens to me, ready and waiting in case I ask it something. But this seems like extreme listening in. Anyone else get the same thing? 

If so, I'm surprised that this is a thing but as a marketer I'm keen to do this for my company! ;)",15,4,2017-09-29,ECOM,0.04945752024650574,0.9221452474594116,0.028397252783179283

woocommerce,Need some suggestions on a Woocommerce theme please,"Hi all! I'm building a website for a friend's business and I need a template that has several components. I have been searching around and find a few that come close, but I haven't found the perfect one yet. Any suggestions would be very helpful. Here are the criteria I'm looking for:

1. Product filter sidebar: I like the Ajax filter abilities and want something that allows to make the filter list generate by AND and OR so multiple types can be selected at the same time. For example, green shirts AND blue shirts in both SM and LRG, all using tick boxes or whatever in the sidebar. Then a button to clear all filters. Ideally, results would be generated on the shop page in a default order I choose, like in stock items first, or featured items first, etc. It also needs to be able to have subcategories in it with drop downs, and quantity numbers beside the names, [like this for example.](http://www.designsandcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/search-filter-screen-1.png), but with a quantity shown option.

1. Yith plugins compatible. I have access to all of them, so I just want to make sure they are compatible should I need to use anything that's not natively included in the theme.

1. Instagram feed along bottom or side.

1. Mega Menu (not a deal breaker)

1. Top bar, able to add store details and possibly newsletter signup in top bar above main header slider.

1. Revolution Slider, mainly for home page slides.

1. Newsletter signup, with optional pop-up window and sign up from cart/checkout.

1. Product alert for when back in stock, sent to email. 

1. Product wishlist

1. Blog page with recent posts shown on home page and product page if we want to.

1. Badge management for In Stock, Featured, New items, etc., preferably without an additional plugin because those seem to not work right all the time (Yith compatible if no native one included in theme)

1. Cart messages for ""add $$$ to cart to receive free shipping"" and others (Yith compatible if no native one included in theme)

1. Recently viewed items slider on bottom or side, also ""Things you may also like"" and ""featured products"" sliders.

1. Order tracking with clickable USPS link (Yith compatible if no native one included in theme)

1. Abandoned cart feature (Yith compatible if no native one included in theme)

1. This one may be tricky - or simple and I'm not that smart, which is highly probable - but we want to be able to offer the customer in the local area to add a delivery option for us to bring the items to them directly, for an additional fee of course. But it has to be addressed based obviously.
