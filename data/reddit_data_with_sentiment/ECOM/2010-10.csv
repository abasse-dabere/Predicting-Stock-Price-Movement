ecommerce,Questions about WePay,"Has anyone checked out [WePay](http://wepay.com/)? I was wondering some things about it:

* Does it let me take money in currencies like the British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro, or Indian Rupee, even if I'm in the USA? If so, what are the fees for this?

* Does it have a limit on how much money can be moved through an account per a certain time period?

* What if I sell a plugin for WordPress through an LLC business type. I'm aware that WePay has an API. I mostly only see WePay being discussed for organizations and people, not for businesses. Can I use it for a business? I was thinking that if I set up the payment system, and someone doesn't pay me, then I don't deliver the plugin to the user.

* How are charges contested? What if the customer reports something bogus to WePay, already has my WordPress plugin downloaded -- can WePay force me to return the money without even having the power to contest that the customer's statement was just a bogus scam to rip me off as the seller?

* Any other major differences with PayPal that I should be aware of?",4,3,2010-10-27,ECOM,0.03472939133644104,0.9363328814506531,0.028937695547938347
