ecommerce,"Feedback needed: no sales yet - Launched a month ago, selling stylish Japanese products","Hi everyone,

Here's my store: http://www.thejapaneseselectshop.com

Launched about a month ago, soft launch. Narrow assortment --I know--but I'm adding between 1 to 4 products every two weeks. The products, I believe, are pretty nice and desirable. Prices are reasonable, as a matter of fact I'm cheaper than most competition.

I'm getting anywhere between 20 to 70 visits per day. Traffic is coming from Facebook, Instagram and Quora. Blogging will come later, not a priority at the moment as for now I'm focusing on design and product selection.

My issue is that most people abandon their cart. I've gone through the checkout process myself, it's not the most beautiful thing: I need to use Paypal as in Japan there's no proper credit card gateway system but I refuse to think it's what scared those people away.

Feedback much appreciated and thanks in advance!

ecommerce,How to list similar products without getting slammed by Search Engines?,"A partner and I are in the process of setting up an online High End Art Materials Store.

We are planning to have a separate page for each and every shade of paint/pencil available, however as they are fundamentally the same items all of these would share the same main description with changes only in the Barcode, Color and SKU number fields.

Have read online that duplicate content on a lot of pages will make the Search Engines effectively filter us out. Any advice on how to avoid this?

ecommerce,Is it better to launch fast then fix or optimize but be very slow?,"As my partner and I look towards launching our online Art Materials store, we often have a debate and could think of no better community to weigh in with their considerable experience.

However let me give you a bit of background first.
Background: We are setting up an online store for the sale of high quality Art Materials. Additionally we will also be selling through the large marketplaces currently active in order to maximize sales channels. We have the advantage of partnering with a large importer of Art Materials in India who carries close to 6000+ SKUs.

Our Challenge:
Our SKUs are a very large number as there are a lot of items which have variations only in terms of color, being Art Materials this isn't a big surprise is it? Creating unique copy for all these products and making each shade of color pencil or paint sound unique seems like a huge task which is impossible in the three weeks from today we have given ourselves to launch.

We plan to create very simple yet accurate descriptions for our products almost like bullet points to speed up the process. They will have a lot of duplicate content as in most cases color pencils will only differ in terms of their color or brushes in terms of their size. 

Given the emphasis the entire internet seems to give to unique copy though we are questioning our approach.

What are your thoughts? Launch with the simpler descriptions and fix them slowly later or Optimize each one painstakingly and then launch each product as we get done?

If you need any more info to help you offer advice do leave a comment or shoot me a direct message.

TL;DR: Launch huge no of products with simple similar descriptions or at a snails pace with unique content for each product?",4,3,2015-12-01,ECOM,0.0199165977537632,0.9333540201187134,0.04672934487462044

shopify,"Shopify, woocommerce or hiring someone for $500 + ?","Hello Reddit,

I am in the market to start my new business venture selling boxed sealed foods. 

I have the products and box shipments pricing down. I just need a website now to start getting customers. 

I'm looking at designing my website through shopify, but I have no knowledge of designing websites, SEO, or anything that comes after, how do I promote my page other than instagram, fb and youtube? 

Also, I would need a customer subscription button which shopify charges at $20 a month along with website $29 a month so that's already $49 a month and I have to do all the website design etc and no help of SEO.

I found a designer on youtube and he is offering $500 for website + SEO and $40 a month for 1 year then $9 a month from there on and he takes care of everything. 

Also, my local craigslist ecommerce services offer the same thing, but webeminence's youtube videos makes me sound like he know what hes doing much more than local craigslist. 

Would this be a good investment to start my business? I mean, the website is all I got in terms of selling my product and I want to make it the best and drive the most traffic possible to it. 

Start up money within the thousand is not an issue since I have a day job, I realize at $10 a box profit , it would take me 60 customers to regain from this investment, but all is worth it if I get customers, rather than using shopify and not getting any customers. 

An example of website I want to ""duplicate"" would be universalyums.com for reference.

ecommerce,Looking to get involved with my girlfriends online boutique.,"So, long story short I helped my girlfriend set up a big cartel site last year after her vintage brick and mortar store didn't do as well as expected. She has a small online presence and has had some decent stretches of consistency within her sales. Only problem is she's constantly scouring for new stock (selling vintage clothes is my idea of hell) she has a really good eye for it but it often comes in dribs and drabs. I've always preached that she needs something else to help push the store along.

A niche has opened up in our area, where a similar business that sold jewellery has moved on to sell different things. I've proposed to my girlfriend to step in and take the spot. She used to buy things from there all the time and it did seem to do well within its own right. Obviously she liked the idea and she's now deadset on learning the craft of jewellery making. 

I've advised her to step away from bigcartel and find her own domain. At the moment most of her traffick comes from her social media accounts. I'd like to do some local advertising and think a proper web address is more professional.

What I'm asking for is some suggestions on things to read. Ive lurked the sub for a while but never got my hands dirty. Id like to get fully submerged in the world of ecommerce .

This really is about two problems wrapped up into one. We sell fabric and use the Measurement Price Calculator plugin to allow customers to specify the length of fabric. We'd like to use the weight of the shopping cart items in an API call to Australia Post to get an shipping quote.

Items that aren't fabric i.e. that are sold in complete units would have weight as normal.

Is there a problem with tracking the shopping cart weight with a session variable or would it make more sense to add another piece of meta data for the line items to track individual weight?

ecommerce,I've built my own E-commerce + ERP + CRM solution for internal use. Do you think going commercial might be a good idea?,"I'm an entrepreneur but also a developer. Been in both fields for long time.

To keep things short. I wasn't satisfied by the features of the off-the-shelf solutions (not to name 5 to 6 digit pricing for ERP systems), so in the last few years I've written my own complete solution from scratch. 

I have my own custom CMS, and on top of that I've built my own shopping cart, but also an ERP + CRM system. The whole stuff is completely integrated, meaning that all orders from the website go straight into the ERP, even if residing on different servers (public website on an public host, ERP on the Intranet). So you can invoice them with a click, or manage customers with the CRM module, again with a click. So basically it's a one-does-it-all solution, built to be fast and flexible. You don't need another program, not even a website if you want, it's all included. The  product's target would be small to medium enterprises. It will also integrate with Wordpress sites if necessary, via a plugin.

Regarding features, here are some examples. You can build a website, track conversions, track visitors and everything, even share resource accross multiple websites or domains. Then list products, customizable shopping cart, get orders, manage stock inventory, prepare and print receipts, invoices and pro-forma, local, import and export invoices, manage customers, sales reports, and so on. The ERP even has some neat useful plugins like calendar/reminder, label printing (printing custom labels for packaging), tracking cheques, customs tarriff codes, package weight calculation, automatic currency exchange ratio update, multiple companies, multiple departments, multiple inventories per company, transfers, ISO9001 document management, employees, ticketing/sales tracking, and a lot of other features I'm not going to mention because this is a long list already. One of the significant advantages of the system is that it's built for speed and volume, handling 1000's of SKU's, 1000's of orders, and so on. It has been in internal daily use for 2 years already without any issues.

My question to you is the following. 

Do you think it is worth offering this solution as a commercial product (under SaaS model)? I'm not sure what the potential of my solution is, given the fact that there are so many other solutions out there already.

I'm considering offering a fully managed, ready-to-use solution that includes hosting and everything. (The main advantages being, ready-to-use, fully integrated E-commerce+ ERP solution, cross-platform (runs in browser), fast and reliable, and the possibility of further customization based on customer request).

Any tips would be appreciated, thanks!

**Edit:** I've just realized that there are 2 completely different customer segments here, different needs, different pricing. Maybe there are other potential segments as well. They difference is set by the ERP features. So basically I have a 2-in-1 solution without knowing. Those 2 portions are clearly identifiable and can be clearly separated, and I think the features should narrow down as to the needs of each of these individual segments of customers.

On one end, there are the high-end ERP customers that will require a full-blown solution with all the features, whole nine yards; having deeper pockets and higher demands (E-commerce + CRM + ERP). 

On the other hand, there will be customers that will want only E-commerce and CRM for their features, for example some of the neat ones like multi-site, multi-server integration under a single central account/CRM. These customers will obviously pay less per month, but setting them up is also cheaper.

**Edit2:** I also want to give a big thanks to everyone that posted comments below. I'm getting tremendously valuable feedback here; exceeding all my initial expectations.

ecommerce,Photography Feedback,"Hey,

I launched a site (www.antandre.com) a couple of weeks ago and one thing that has been nagging me is my photography. 

1. I sell fine jewelry in the 400-1500 price range, so I understand that the image quality has to be good.

2. I'm also on a shoestring budget, and jewelry photographers charge around $10-30 per image. I instead used someones jewelry studio in their office, took raw images, and had them touched up through upwork. 

That being said, I realize that my photography might not be perfect, but I wanted to know what people thought. 

Do all the images need to be redone? Just some of them? Does anything look inconsistent?

ecommerce,"Thought I understood cross-border shipping, but now I'm super confused","So, I have two different online stores shipping 100% Canadian-made products across Canada and the USA.

**There are 3 types of fees** that items can get hit with when crossing the border:

* Customs brokerage fees: a fee to manage getting shit over the border
* Taxes: the sales taxes applied to the product based on where it is shipping to
* Duties: extra fees based on what the item is to protect domestic industry

**Here was my original understanding on what happened with each** based on talking to the manufacturer for one of my store's items AND talking to the customer service of the label re-seller company who sells me discounted UPS labels AND talking to Canada Post's customer service who helped me in the past as well:

* Customs brokerage fees: a flat $25 that's unavoidable and always gets charged to me (gets waived on shipments under $250 though)
* Taxes: whatever the country's sales tax is this gets applied to the product and I can choose whether it gets charged to me or the receiver (I didn't want to make things complicated for our business so I set the customer to pay them and I charge them no sales tax when they buy from me)
* Duties: my understanding was that by default, all Canadian-made goods do not get charged a duty as long as I declare them Canadian-made on the customs invoice (as a result of NAFTA)


The **UPS brokerage folks** just called me asking if I had a NAFTA form, which is free to fill out. Apparently I sign up and renew once per year and just need to attach the form to every shipment. They **tell me that**:

**If I DON'T attach a NAFTA form**

* Customs brokerage: gets charged to the same place the taxes are getting charged
* Taxes: get charged wherever I ask them to be charged
* Duties: get charged to the same place as the taxes and will be charged even on Canadian-made goods if I don't attach this form indicating I participate in NAFTA



**If I DO attach a NAFTA form**

* Customs brokerage: will NEVER be charged on shipments containing only Canadian-made goods
* Taxes: will NEVER be charged on shipments containing only Canadian-made goods (although they were less sure here because I know in Canada I have to charge the local sales tax rate to each province then remit the summaries by province to CRA each year, so it doesn't seem right to me that Americans buying from Canadian can just avoid sales tax altogether and I didn't really get a straight answer)
* Duties: will NEVER be charged on shipments containing only Canadian-made goods

Anyone with a lot of experience want to shed some light? Would be great if you could include actual informational links as I've been getting a lot of inconsistent information from multiple sources and don't know who to believe because there are always aspects that someone is unsure about.

woocommerce,How to Build a Cart Where Every Item Can be Customized by Buyer,"A client has asked me to a add a shopping cart to their Wordpress site that allows every item to be customized. Since everything is customized, pricing has to be done manually.

The order flow should go something like this, the customer sees a list of items, they click to add it to their order, and modal pops up asking for quantity and customization notes. Once their cart is ready, they submit the order, along with a bunch of custom fields.  The company will price the order, then the customer should be notified they can pay online.

ecommerce,Looking for a developer geared flexible ecommerce platform - any suggetions?,"I'm new to ecommerce, but am interested in using an ecomerce platform to build a shopping portal. 

I have three specific needs, and I'm having trouble finding a platform that would necessarily be suited for all three.


**First: I'd like the front end of the portal to be heavily and easily customizable.**

I'd want to do a lot of a/b testing, in a number of areas, so having the ability to change not just the appearance of the site, but also things like the checkout flow would be vital. This rules out, for example, shopify, which form what I've seen has a fairly inflexible check out process.

**Second: I'd to be able to sell products that are a bundled collection of smaller products.** 

As a comparable example, I could be selling candles. I'd want the customer to be able to purchase these in packs of varying sizes (4, 8, 16, etc). I'd want these packs to be customizable with varying numbers of candles, x of a scented + y of b scented + z of c scented etc. Because of the many variations, it seems unreasonable to represent each variation as an individual product, or as x number orders of one candle each, but I'd also have to make sure that the order preserves enough information to send to the manufacturer.

**Finally: I'd like to the user to be able to sign up for these packs as a subscription service.**

Perhaps monthly, bi monthly or even weekly.

At one point,  I thought of trying out Alibaba to manufacture my own men's underwear and perhaps private label them, though I thought the best way to sell them was via Amazon as I don't have much funds for marketing efforts, but that too seems less possible due to Amazon requiring UPCs code which are quite expensive. And I can't seem to find any companies out there that wholesale these brand name underwear products either.

dropship,Dropshipping Business 8 Month Review. Using the power of arbitrage to make extra money on Amazon.,"Over the past 8 months I've been using a dropshipping technique that I wanted to share and also promote to others to join me. Below is a step by step process what I've done to help others benefit from the tools I've used and hopefully to make extra money on the side. I started in March and have had over $400K in sales.

Sales image: http://imgur.com/vzMYvmX
Last 30 Days Sales: http://imgur.com/RSS3Unh

First, I educated myself on how to dropship. I used a platform called DSD which was introduced by a friend of mine. www.saleswithbryan.com is the landing page of the introduction. I do subscribe and paid for the service. $20/mo to learn to sell on eBay and $499/one time payment to learn to sell on Amazon. I've been asked many times if it is worth it. For me it was as I've gained back my purchase in profit within a month. The opportunity cost for not purchasing must be much more because the training and access gives you detailed answered to selling on Amazon. The price you pay for having Amazon holding your funds or cancelling your account because you don't know what fulfillment latency and order defect rates are when you start out are not worth learning on your own, which most people do.

Month to Month breakdown:

March -April:  Started off small by listing 5-10 products each week, finding items from Walmart, Academy.com, Home Depot, Wayfair, Toy's R Us, ect.... March and April I had $19K in sales. Orders totaled 70 and I handled the entire account, from sales, inventory checks, returns and customer service. 

May - Used same listing tactics to have around 70 products. Yielded $50K in sales. 
    - Hired a Virtual Assistant for $4.95/hr to handle all inventory checks which involved 30 min/work per day. 
    - Started recording vidoes of ordering items from websites/handling customer service/processing returns.
      ( I did this to train another Virtual Assistant)
    - Use Cash Back services such as Upromise.com/EBates/CoinRebates to receive additional cash back to make my profits increase.

June - Capped product listings at 100. Sales at $60K for June. 
    - Hired VA #2 to start training and learning Amazon account process at $6/hr. from Elance.com
    - Increased credit card limits to fund more orders so I can sell more. THIS IS IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO ADD SALES. I have access to $50K in credit which allows for more orders to be placed.

July - Sales at $50K
    - Account gets ""pending locked"" because of higher than normal cancellation rates. Amazon holds my funds for 2 weeks but I appealed and the account was unlocked and I had access to may payments.
     - Started training videos for Virtual Assistant to place orders 

August - Sales at $72K
    - Virtual Assistant #1 turnover. Was not performing tasks each day. Trained VA #2 to handle VA#1's tasks
    - Hired VA #3 for $9.75/hr to process orders. She worked for about 1-2hrs/day. I decided to pay more because she was located in the US and had access to my credit card information. 

September - Sales at $30K
   - Sales slow down because VA#2's could not work for a month. Had to delist many products and handle customer service myself.

October - Sales at $0
   - VA #2 still could not work. Put account on vacation as I was traveling for 3 weeks.
   - Contacted Accountant to review accounting procedures for Tax Return. Used his advice and did bookkeeping.
   - Used Godaddy.com Bookkeeping to import all sales and expenses for Tax Return.

November - Sales at $36.
   - VA#2 was back online and started training another VA to handle customer service as well.
   - last two weeks of sales increased for Thanksgiving sales
   - VA #4 trained and started using the account for customer service.

December 1st-12th- Sales at $99K
   - Large increase in sales
   - Cash flow issues as credit cards have been currently maxed out. 
   - Largest profit per month

So here is my overall sales: $400K, profits of about $20K which is about 5% gross profit per item. Profit margins were small to start as my account was new and had to learn how to price items effectively. Some items I lost money. Now profit margin is 8-11% for November and December.

I hope this helps to give others a blueprint and advice on how to approach dropshipping. Message me for any questions as I'm willing to train people on how to do this. 

Cheers,

ecommerce,Why am I not getting any traffic? What am I missing here?,"Hey everyone! :)

You guys and gals always give such amazing advice and I've always followed it, yielding amazing results. But the one thing I'm still perplexed about is gaining traffic. I don't know how to do it and i don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

I have used FB Ads in the past.
I have Google Shopping currently. 
I use Ad Words currently. 
I give out free items to fashion bloggers.
I post regularly on instagram, twitter, fb, google + and tumblr.
I blog on my website.
I use other free marketing tools such as online forums, wheretogetit, and more. 

Still nothing. I have made a few sales. Last week I was ecstatic when, for the first time ever, I made 2 sales in one day. I know it's a way smaller scale than what many of you are used to, but I figure in due time I'll be making a ton of sales. 

I changed my site after the suggestions I received here months ago. It's easy to navigate and I think the photos look nice. Usually I have abandoned carts, but I have apps put in place for that (checkout recovery). I even use referral services (referral candy). 

Still nothing.  I know if my traffic increased, more sales and the word will get out. But for some reason, despite all that I'm doing, I barely hit 30 visitors a day. 

Here are my google analytics stats for the past month (Nov 14th - Dec 14th):

1) due to pricing differences per customer, it may be necessary to have clients login to make their orders so they only see their pricing - is there a good platform/module for this?

2) many of the orders made each month are the same (restocking their raw materials) so are there recommendations on a subscription type service that would automatically bill them and send the order each moth unless they specify otherwise?

Our current software we use is:
OsCommerce,
Quickbooks, 
authorize.net

here is how we are processing orders:

1. receive order on oscommerce admin.  payment is ""authorized"" but not captured on authorize.net (in case back order, etc we only take payment when we ship).

2. When order is ready to ship we manually enter customer information as new customer in quickbooks (this takes time especially when entering 20-30 orders for the day).

3. manually create invoice in quickbooks to match oscommerce. 

4. ""receive"" payment in quickbooks. 

5. Capture credit card on authorize.net

We are in the process of switching to magento which will I think have addons that help with this process but I am not 100% sure yet.

Looking for advice regarding e-commerce platforms for B2B companies.  As a bit of backstory, I work for a company for which most of its business is B2B, and that has a complex pricing structure in it's backend ERP.  Either through quotes or signed agreements, we end up with prices that are unique to the customer on specific items, and/or % discount on list for the balance of the items.  Then, there might be ongoing promos that might supersede these prices for a short amount of time.  We also have complex surcharges that are computed in the backend.  

I know that our ERP solution has an integrated e-commerce platform, but I am wondering if the trendy e-commerce platforms (Magento, Shopify, etc) would support these custom prices / charges, and how this would be integrated.  What we are trying to do is display our catalog of products to these customers, but still make sure their complex pricing scheme still reflect on the site's prices when selling to an authentified customer account.

Anyone having experience with such a complex integration, and any advice as we head into this project?

ecommerce,Advice needed: Handling a marketplace's data privacy handling incompetence.,"Long story short: My company does business with an online marketplace which allows the downloading of CSV files for order fulfillment that holds some sensitive customer data. This includes names, addresses, phone numbers, what they bought, how much they paid, and possibly their email addresses.  

The company tries to hide the actual URL of the CSV files through a not-so-clever redirect, however when there is a server error, it shows the real source of the CSV file. One can then use a simple script to download all of the orders:  

for ($i=1000000; $i&lt;2000000; $i++){ shell_exec('wget http://static.marketplace.com/orderdata/'.$i.'CSV');}

This script can be used even without being logged into the marketplace back end. Also notice that this can be used even if I'm not the vendor for fulfillment and they are not using SSL for encryption.  
  
I have sent this marketplace numerous requests on what they will do about the data being public going all the way back to 2011. There are many hundreds of thousands of orders and customers. I keep getting these one-liners about how they're ""working on it"". I have run it up the chain to the CIO and gotten zero response. Is there anything else I should try? Are there any official avenues I can use to get this data locked down via authentication and SSL? In the end, I'm just trying to protect our mutual customers.

**Update!**  
  
I had a conference call with the CIO and other managers. They stated that they are working on revamping the back end. They more or less admitted to the problem, but tried to weasel their way out of their accountability to their customers by saying I was ""hacking around"", requesting data that isn't meant to be public. I pointed out that it wasn't hacking and that it was plain as day on their server. I explained that this type of breach has probably existed for a number of years. She told me that they didn't know of anyone downloading the orders - I asked how they knew this - did they check the server logs? She didn't know what I was talking about at this point. She then tried to blame it on the ""old system"" and that she'd been a CIO for 21 years -  I should have asked ""Did you attempt to secure those old systems too?"". However, I'm in a festive mood - Christmas is 2 days away, so I let them off the hook and said that I hope they fix it quickly. I recorded the conversation and will be following up in the coming days.",6,5,2015-12-22,ECOM,0.0903543010354042,0.884045422077179,0.02560029737651348

I've created an online store: http://newselect.co/ using WooCommerce, but I can't figure out what is a good way to allow credit card as a Payment Gateway as WooCommerce doesn't seem to have that by default.

I've done a lot of searching and found a few free plugins like [this](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-paypal-pro-payment-gateway/) and [this](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-payment-gateway/), and also found a [paid extension](https://www.woothemes.com/products/paypal-advanced/) from WooCommerce themselves.

I just need some perspective from you guys about which one I should go with. I'm on a tight budget so I want to avoid getting something very expensive like what I've linked above. I'm also a web developer so it should be very difficult for me to implement an option and I just need to be guided in the right direction.

Also, I will really appreciate a feedback for the website :)

Thanks!

ecommerce,Expanding product offerings / logical ecommerce arrangements. Need advice please.,"I have a outdoor clothing company and am having some success with it.  When I started, I had 3 weights (think lightweight/windbreaker, midweight/hoodie, and heavyweight/parka).

Getting started,  I simplified the offerings going from the 3 product lines mentioned above, to just the lightweight one, with a men's and women's model, and different colors.

I would like to expand out again, perhaps seasonally, but my question is how best to lay out the site.

Looking for advice - do I have pages at the top (Men's &amp; Women's) only and then expand into light, medium, heavy - or do I have that as a main tab?

shopify,"How do I search only ""title"" ""tag"" and ""vendor"" without issue? Where can I get help?","#  Update: Can someone recommend a search APP that searches more than the default search engine?  (title/tag/vendor) Thanks.

I tried forums, customer support, stackoverflow and the IRC.  (no one responded except customer support that said they don't know)
I'm pretty sure most people know the answer to my question.

If I use this default search 
    
    &lt;form method=""get"" action=""/search"" id=""search-home""&gt;
                    &lt;button type=""submit"" value=""search""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;input type=""text"" type=""search"" name=""q"" placeholder=""Search"" value=""{{ search.terms | escape }}""/&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;

Then it doesn't properly search every item that has that tag/title/vendor.   It also ends up searching information it shouldn't (a products description and some other hidden parameter I haven't found out) so it'll end up searching items that I didn't ask for.  

My solution was this, but it came with bugs.  
    
    &lt;form method=""get"" action=""/search"" id=""search-home""&gt;
                &lt;button type=""submit"" value=""search""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""type"" value=""product"" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""q"" class=""searchtext"" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text"" name=""original"" placeholder=""Search""/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
    
        &lt;script&gt;
        $(document).on('submit','#search-home',function(){
         var searchtext = $('input[name=""original""]').val();
          $('.searchtext').val(""vendor:""+searchtext+"" OR tag:""+searchtext+"" OR title:""+searchtext);
        });
    
        &lt;/script&gt;

The main problem this caused was I can't use spaces in my searches now, and another issue is if I try to append *  at the end to allow partials, then I can't search ampersands.  
When I type **gold candle** the result is **/search?type=product&amp;q=vendor%3Agold+candle+OR+tag%3Agold+candle+OR+title%3Agold+candle&amp;original=gold+candle#fullscreen=true&amp;search=home**

What do I do?  Or where can I get help with this?

Already contacted my theme designer website (premium theme) and they were no help.",3,1,2015-12-31,ECOM,0.020540693774819374,0.9391107559204102,0.04034854844212532
