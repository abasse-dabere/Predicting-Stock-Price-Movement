ecommerce,Best way to do repeat custom orders on shopify?,"Hi guys,

I have a concept in mind for a new fashion store that I want to set up on Shopify.

My idea is that people will have the option to buy either pre-made or bespoke fashion items.

To create a bespoke item, I will get them to respond to 6 multiple choice questions which will inform how the item is designed. I will also need to add in some additional info myself to make the item truly unique.

Once the item is created, I would then like to give the customer the option to easily re-order the same item.

Does this sound like something that would be doable on shopify? 

Could the custom orders be stored in each user's account so that they can re-order them in future? The problem is that the customer's answers to the 6 questions won't be the full extent of the custom item, because I will need to look at the answers and add details myself. Not sure how this can be implemented?

dropship,"Total noob here, just some questions!","Hey guys! 

So i heard about drop shipping on Youtube and decided to do a little research and so far it seems like something i could get into, just some very important things that i'm still confused about.

\- Legality

Is dropshipping even technically legal? It just seems to easy to be able to pretty much sell someone elses product.

\- Refunds

How would refunds even work at all? Seeing as you are shipping someone elses product, how does customer service even work?

\- Losing money

So at the moment it appears to me that there's not really any real upfront cost to dropshipping, so what do people mean when they say that they've lost lots of money? Would that be from mishaps from sales / returns / possibly even getting in trouble with someone you're reselling from, or just failed advertisement or something like that?

Anyways that about all the questions i have for now :) Thanks for any replies!",6,4,2018-08-02,ECOM,0.20192930102348328,0.756716251373291,0.04135451465845108

ecommerce,Looking for Store Owner Perspective - Product Manufacturer Selling Online Directly,"We run a small candy company, we've been making and selling only wholesale for about a few years now and we have a good chunk of wholesale clients.

I'd say 98% of them are individuals who sell in their own stores (Candy Store, Gift Shops, etc.) and only a handful of them sell online (maybe 15 of them - 4 of which primarily sell online). One of those happens to be one of our largest customer.

I really respect and value the relationships with our wholesale clients greatly and they will always be my top priority -- that being said -- we have a pretty large amount of variation to our products and it's quite rare for people to offer our whole catalog of flavors, etc. Honestly, I don't expect anyone to sell everything either. It's just a lot, I know first hand how hard it is to inventory that all and keep it in stock.

We get a lot of emails from potential buyers looking to get our products and when they don't have a local store we try to point them online but either a retailer doesn't sell all the flavors they want or they're split up between multiple sources. I want to be sure we're giving people what they want and the availability to buy the product. It doesn't feel good to leave a conversation saying. ""Sorry, I guess you can't buy it..."" when someone wants our product and we obviously have it on our hands.

We plan on starting to sell online via our site directly soon here. The plan is to offer everything we have **at the same price as the highest retailer online** so we're not undercutting anyone. We also won't offer the same ""Spend X and get Free Shipping!"" kind of deals any of our retailers do. It'll just be a way to end the availability issue for us.  We're not going to make a killing selling direct like this or anything -- it's **100%** about the availability.

\------ 

**SO** \-- That being said, that's where I want some perspective from individuals who run stores. Would you be annoyed or upset with a source if they started selling online directly at a higher or equal price to you? Would that damage the relationship? 

I've convinced myself the brick &amp; mortar shops wouldn't care less -- but -- am very concerned about our online retailers .

shopify,"Courses, faking sales, dropshipping in 2018, and more","Recently I published a video, and since then people have been questioning dropshipping:
https://youtu.be/5k3B3af0GaU
I wanted to talk about this topic once and for all and start a discussion in this great community, so feel free to comment, upvote, downvote, whatever it may be to share your opinion. 

In the past couple of months, dropshipping has become extremely competitive. Most people who are trying to get into dropshipping simply can't.

However, many youtubers and gurus are making it even worse by saying ""how easy it is"", how dropshipping is the best business to start in 2018.

But, they have a reason to lie to you. The money is made in the vision that dropshipping works, not in dropshipping itself. People are making massive amounts of money because of dropshipping. However, not because they are dropshipping themselves, but because they sell to dropshippers.

Quite simply, in my opinion, dropshipping has become one of the hardest business models to sustain in 2018.

There are a couple of reasons:

1. Amazon

Amazon has become insanely dominant, and people go to Amazon instead of other ecommerce stores.

2. Consumer education

People know now about dropshipping, Aliexpress, and methods like free + shipping. People don't fall for it easily anymore.

I think this is the main reason dropshipping is becoming so difficult.

However, if you are starting dropshipping or have a store, don't give up. I encourage you to try dropshipping for the experience, and what you can learn from it. But if you are looking for an insane amount of income, with out putting in much work, it's not worth it.

Creating a full time income with dropshipping is possible, but it's only for people who truly want it, and are willing to dedicate massive amounts of time to growing their brand/business.


This is my opinion on the current state of dropshipping. Please comment your opinions.

ecommerce,Question on product validation,"Hey guys, a buddy and I are validating a product with a prototype before we place our first order. We are looking to set up a web shop to find out how many visitors that follow through with a purchase. We will ultimately have to tell them we are out of stock, but it will give us a sense of if there is demand.

Is this still a common way of validating products? If so, are there any web shop services (Eg. Shopify, Tictail, etc) without terms and conditions that require commitment to follow through on a sale if we make one?

We want to avoid building our own web shop to start with, but need to be able to do the above.

My goal like many others is to make enough to leave the 9-5 life. I'm not going to give up, just need some assistance.  I search for passion products. Products that solve a problem.  

I've seen articles/videos where people say to go for a niche. I chose to go general so I could test many products, find winners. Based on audiences I would make my store a hybrid store focusing more on a specific category but still testing for others. I currently have a Health and Beauty, Home and Kitchen, Gadgets, and Pets categories. I started my store in June and have only made 1 sale. The customer was in Morocco. I'd like to eventually get to a place where I'm only targeting US.

shopify,Venture Theme Edit - Showing QTY Available,"Im hoping someone can help me out with a little code tweaking.  Im not an expert, but I know a little about coding and have made little tweaks here and there.  I'm on a very tight budget and would like to be able to do this myself. Any advice is appreciated.

In the Venture theme, you can click a checkbox when editing the them for ""Show stock when less than 10 products available"" I have done that, and its working, but not exactly as I want.  It only shows when the inventory is between 1 and 10, it's not showing when I have 0 inventory, and I want it to.

I think I've isolated the code that controls it, but I'm having trouble tweaking it. In the product-template.liquid, I found this:

            {% if section.settings.stock_enable %}
              &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;span id=""ProductStock-{{ section.id }}"" class=""product-single__stock {% unless current_variant.inventory_management and current_variant.inventory_quantity &lt; 10 and current_variant.inventory_quantity &gt; 0 or  current_variant.inventory_management and current_variant.inventory_quantity &lt;= 0 and current_variant.incoming %} hide{% endunless %}""&gt;
                  {% if current_variant.inventory_management %}
                    {% if current_variant.inventory_quantity &lt; 10 and current_variant.inventory_quantity &gt; 0 %}
                      {% assign qty = current_variant.inventory_quantity %}
                      {{ 'products.product.stock_available' | t: count: qty }}
                    {% elsif current_variant.inventory_quantity == 0 or current_variant.inventory_quantity &lt; 0 and current_variant.incoming %}
                      {% if current_variant.available %}
                        {% assign date = current_variant.next_incoming_date | date: ""%B %-d, %Y"" %}
                        {{ 'products.product.will_not_ship_until' | t: date: date  }}
                      {% else %}
                        {% assign date = current_variant.next_incoming_date | date: ""%B %-d, %Y"" %}
                        {{ 'products.product.will_be_in_stock_after' | t: date: date  }}
                      {% endif %}

              &lt;/li&gt;
            {% endif %}

Can anyone make suggestions about what to edit?   

Ideally I would like to be able to add a prompt when there's zero stock.  I've added another piece of code in also (see below), but its only showing when the first variant on the list is at 0, but not when the other variants are clicked. I think I just have it in the wrong space and need to move it.

      {% if product.available %}
     
        {% assign how_many_in_stock = 0 %}
        {% for variant in product.variants %}
          {% if variant.available %}
              {% assign how_many_in_stock = how_many_in_stock | plus: variant.inventory_quantity %}
          {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
        {% if how_many_in_stock &lt; 1 %}
        &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
        &lt;p class=""low-stock-notification""&gt;&lt;B&gt;**** PLEASE CONTACT TO CONFIRM AVAILABILITY. THIS ITEM MAY REQUIRE ADDTIONAL LEAD TIME.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

shopify,Shopify tips for making : how to get more people to register for mail,"There's no doubt that email marketing is important, and in fact, according to research, companies can earn 40 dollars for every dollar they spend on email marketing. So email subscribers have higher response rates and are more connected to your business than other channels.

So, how do you get people to subscribe and buy things?

Next, get authorization from your potential customers.

For many e-commerce companies, a lot of people choose to provide in the mail, short-term discount or the next few days of sale.

In addition to these material incentives, some of the ideas that your target customers value, or ideas, can also be an incentive to subscribe.

1, A women's clothing e-commerce company can write some seasonal fashion guides to help women understand the latest fashion trends and know how to match them.

2, Book e-commerce can provide certain bestsellers, or free sections of the latest books.

3, No matter what your industry, if you can come up with an attractive enough reward, it will be a powerful tool for you

Create a high-conversion landing page

Once you've decided what you're going to give, your next step is to create a landing page, sometimes called a crush surface. A landing page is a page on your website that focuses 100% on getting people to register.

1, Add the landing page url to your social media profile

2, Promote through Google and Facebook ads

3, Connect it to a blog post

4, Link to email

Your landing page needs to contain a compelling headline, some text or video about signing up for the bonus benefits, and a form to register your email.

Put in the strategic registration form

In addition to your landing page, there is a strategy to get more people to sign up, which is to put the registration form properly.

A lot of mail marketing software, will provide the registration form generator. You simply drag the generated code in and put it in the url you want.

Here are some popular apps:

Mailchimp

Aweber

Constant Contact

Campaign Monitor

As we all know, when we are looking at the web, we cannot see the end from the beginning, but only select some parts. So here are some places to think about it

1. Navigation bar. This can be a space for people to fill in a mailbox, and then there's a ""add"" button underneath, and of course the text can be changed: 'subscribe', 'sign up', 'get updates',' get exclusive discounts', 'get our free fashion guide' and so on.

2. Your sidebar. This could be an email box or a name or address box. Then add some of your registration rewards.

3. Your ""about"" interface: after you tell your visitors about your business and products, contact them and subscribe for more information.

4. At the bottom of your blog post, if people can see the bottom, they are interested in your post and are ready to take action. So at this point, put a registration form, the conversion rate will be very high.

5. In the footer of the website. If some visitors jump right to the bottom of your page, but still look at your footer and are interested in your business, you still have a chance to get them to subscribe.

Your checkout page. One of the best ways to get a mailing list

Keep in touch

As you get more and more people on your mailing list, you need to make sure you're always in touch with your subscribers. To do this, there are two options.

1, Often send updates, such as weekly, daily and monthly reports, which are mainly news about your industry that the audience is interested in. These content, had better compare high quality, and have independent content, can have better conversion rate thereby. This option is very useful for companies with new product launches

2,The second option is put the guests on an automated response list. This is a set of emails that you've set up for your implementation and will automatically send them at a certain time.

The most important thing to create your list is to get the customer's authorization and create value. To get customer approval, think about what kind of rewards or quality content you can offer to get people to sign up. Once you have people on your list, focus on the balance between sales and quality content.

dropship,Newbie question. When choosing suppliers on AliExpress,"When choosing suppliers, I know the rule of thumb  is to check for positive reviews and sales. My question is this: is this specific to each individual product? Or just the store overall.

ecommerce,Printing product codes on address labels for easier picking? (Shopify),"EDIT: Managed to solve this one myself.
I use the Order Printer app by shopify where you can edit in liquid. The code needs to scan the order doc so instead of

{% for item in line_items %} {{ item.sku }} {% endfor %}

Hope this helps someone

Thanks for all the input guys!

Hi there,

Due to work and study I have to hand over my work to my partner. The issue is that I am still having to print off address labels using an app in shopify (otherwise I get charged and I use a 3rd party delivery service) and then hand write product codes for picking. I have to process 80 at a time and I'm losing my marbles. 

Is there some kind of simple way of doing this? I have seen apps that assign random SKUs but that isn't what I want. I want address labels to contain the variant so others can pick it easily. For example if a customer bought a XS white tshirt it would read 'WT XS' then the address.

I can't seem to get the liquid code working for it either even though I've entered SKUs in shopify by each variant. 

I think this will probably go over a lot of people's heads but I thought I would ask!

Thanks a lot!",8,3,2018-08-07,ECOM,0.03188356012105942,0.9259942770004272,0.04212217032909393

dropship,Is it worth drop-shopping over-the-counter (OTC) medications in Canada?,"So my friends and I are currently studying pharmacy in Canada and we are developing a health platform that consists of a blog on evidence-based medicine for treating minor ailments. One of the ways that we were thinking of monetizing the platform as a small side-hustle is selling certain OTC medications (only unscheduled products, as schedule 2 and schedule 3 medications require transaction to be in a pharmacy). This is our initial path for dipping our toes into the startup world to gain traction, get users, and get some funding.

Would it be possible to do this through dropshipping? I was thinking an advantage of this would be that we can sell to consumers at a lower price compared to other retail stores and be able to deliver it directly to their homes. However, I'm worried about the shipping time it would take for customers (I read it can take 3-5 to 42 days for shipping). As well, users on our platform can just go to a nearby drugstore to buy the products. What do you guys think about this method? Are there any trusted wholesalers that would sell OTC medications (preferebly in Canada or the states to reduce shipping time/costs)?

Any other ideas for monetizing a health platform? We were also thinking about using our blog as a source of revenue.

dropship,Some noobie Questions,"Hello everyone

I don't know if you get bothered by this alot, but I'm hoping for some advice. I'm a young entrepreneur and have a company doing OK in insurance and consulting. But I always wanted to get into selling products, and my target is actually living off of it! So I take this very serious.

Now I found dropshipping for myself. But I'm not really 100% sure how to get into it. I mean I learnt from my first business that I'm very disciplined and stay motivated for a very long time. I'm also financially pretty well off, so I can use like 1'000-2'000 USD a Month to invest into ad's and so on for dropshipping.

But now to my questions.

1) is it better for me to build a seperate store to sell the products, or is it easier for beginners to sell on amazon, ebay and so on?

2) does it make sense to use help like shopify or oberlo, because I find it pretty confusing and hard to find suppliers at all?

3) I'm from Switzerland, so I guess it makes sense for me to sell the products into central europe, or doesen't that affect me at all? I mean, if my suppliers are from asia for example, I can sell to anywhere anyways, no?

4) and last question: how do I easily connect my shop with my suppliers, so I don't have to order manually each order I get at my supplier myself. Cause I think that would just eat too much time I can invest in reaching more customers.

Sorry if you're tired of posts like that, but I'm taking this very seriously and seek for some good advice. And my questions didnt really get answered by the guides I found, because it relies pretty much on experience.

Thank you very very much if you take time to answer some of these questions for me!

dropship,Question regarding packaging...,"Hey everyone, I have been wondering about this for a while. How do customers feel when they receive your product in Chinese or AliExpress packaging? Because surely since it’s coming from the Chinese wholesaler, the packaging &amp; additional promos contained in the parcel are going to be in Chinese or at least Chinese &amp; some (hopefully competent) English, right? Does this not tarnish your brand image? Is it possible to organize a custom packing for dropshipping with AliExpress / Shopify (for example)? 

I just don’t want to (for example) have a really cool &amp; clean English brand called “COOL STUFF” &amp; when the customer picks up their much-anticipated package it is covered with random foreign symbols, advertisement for “AliExpress” &amp; sloppy English lol. I would imagine this would not result in that customer returning.

ecommerce,Gamification - will it work in upsell app?,"Hello Guys, 

I just want to share with you an idea of innovative upsell application dedicated to Shopify platform at first stage but also to other ecomm platforms in the future. Before I invest more time and resources to this project it would be great to know your opinion about it.

Do you think this idea makes sense? Would you be interested in joining tests for this kind of application? 

Main idea behind the app is to use gamification to increase basket value and at the same time total store’s sales value. The process will take place in the Product Detail Page. Customer will get opportunity to discover extra discounts by clicking small button next to the “Buy now” button. It won’t be obligatory. Everything will be delivered in a way that will not interfere with the purchase process. No annoying pop ups at all. Only small button. When the Customer decides to check proposition he will get the chance to play simple game for example scratch game (you scratch by moving cursor left and right or up and down on the scratch surface). Every Customer will win super promotions based on number of additional products added to the basket. He will be able to choose which discount is the best for him. For instant % discount, free delivery or freebie. After clicking on the selected promotion he will be instantly redirected to checkout page. Discount and additional products will be automatically added to the basket. Of course promotion won’t be obligatory. Customer will have possibility to finish an order without discount and extra products. To generate urgency effect the time will be limited. Thanks to the app customer will receive discount in very nice and friendly way. He will have feeling of winning something. It will be his lucky day. It's the magic of gamification. From psychological point of view this is the best way to present discounts and promotions to customers. In addition we skip irritating pop ups. All statistics and efficiency metrics will be available from administration panel. Visual effects and texts will be fully customizable. The store owner will be able to choose the product pages on which game will be available.

I can send you presentation/demo. Please let me know if you are interested.

I will appreciate your feedback and remarks. Thanks a lot!",5,7,2018-08-09,ECOM,0.02190796472132206,0.9277617931365967,0.05033022165298462

ecommerce,How to manage multiple email accounts on iphone (moved from Android),"I have been an Android user and I am fully integrated into the Google ecosystem.

Recently I moved to iPhone and realized that sending emails from multiple address is pretty hard with iPhone.

&amp;nbsp;

I am trying to figure out a way to set up email accounts.

I have my own business going on while being employed and also I have different personal emails.

I have 15 email accounts to send the emails from.

If I were to use the gmail account, everything is fine.

&amp;nbsp;

But the problem is that iPhone does not let me seamlessly go back and forth between an email address link online (even email address in my contact) to gmail app on ios. It always leads me to the mail app.

&amp;nbsp;

Since I travel a lot, setting up 15 accounts will drain my battery very fast. If setting up multiple accounts would not drain my battery, I will be fine but still not happy from setting up all those accounts.

Is there a solution to this? Or should I just suck it up?",7,6,2018-08-11,ECOM,0.04993269592523575,0.916774332523346,0.03329295665025711

My idea is to run a multi-vendor e-commerce that will allow small business owners to put up their art. However, I'm working on a tight budget (already used most of it) and I'm having issues with figuring the most cost-effective way to allow vendors to manage their stores.

So I'm asking, using WCmarketplace as the plugin (free version) is it possible to:
1. allow the user to have some control of their store design, I keep trying to find how vendors would see their store on the free version but vender registration leads me back to my account on the frontend.

2. would a cheap fix be for me to set up and modify vendor stores from backend until I can afford the frontend addon

I was wondering how the CBD niche is growing, and what the upsides and downsides are. I realize that the marijuana is gaining ground in societal acceptance, even though most CBD is made from hemp, but these two are in the same boat.

I understand too that you need to find a high risk payment processor. I was wondering is this aspect of the business make for any difficulties? Also, does the demand and markup (from say wholesale) make it a worthy business? Thanks in advance.

ecommerce,I asked a the owner of a content agency that builds thousands of product pages' content for large e-commerce companies that rely on search engine traffic for sales. Here's the process that he shared with me.,"I recently did an in-depth Q&amp;A with an owner of a content production agency that serves thousands of product pages to e-commerce companies every month about a topic that I've seen far too many solo-e-commerce-players struggle with ever so often: Product page content.

E-commerce SEO is a different beast compared to traditional landing pages and articles. You don't have as much freedom in terms of what content and headings you can add and there usually is a rigid structure. What e-commerce content pages lack in flexibility, however, they more than make up for with strong structured-data affinities that can result in money-making organic traffic.

Product description pages are the front-lines of converting visitors into customers. The right description can convince a visitor to take the plunge, or become convinced that whatever their needs were in their web searches can be fulfilled by your products.

The expert that I talked to has a large team that produces optimized content for online stores' product pages with strict targets for SEO, which is not an easy feat. There's only so many ways you can write about a pair of blue jeans, after all... Which is why they have a set of rules by which anyone can build high-quality content for their product pages. I'm listing these down in full below in a step-by-step format, which I'm sharing below for anyone who's looking to optimize their product content:

* Create a list of your biggest competitors. Guys who you want to be in the next 1-3 years.
* Run their category pages through Ahrefs and SEMRush to check what keywords they get their traffic from.
* Sort those keywords by search volume and pick one that can serve as the primary keyword for your page
* Look up that primary keyword on Google to see what yoou're competing against. Sometimes these will be competing stores, sometimes they'll be blogs or other kinds of pages.
* Open the top-ranked pages and build notes on the following:

1. *How the pages are introducing the content. What is the first paragraph on the page and does it accurately and instantly address the intent of the visitor?*
2. *What other “questions” does the written text “answer” for the visitor?*
3. *What content is on the page that I wouldn’t have considered added, but is absolutely helpful to to the visitor.*
4. *What content on the page is fluff and unnecessary.*
5. *What information is common among all of the pages I’m analyzing?*
6. *What information can I add to my content that is helpful to the visitor and is missing from one or more of the pages I’m analyzing?*

* The answers to these questions will give you everything you need in regards to what you should be including and what information should be omitted.

Now you'll have a clear idea of what the bare minimum is for your content to be able to compete with the rest. For a starting point, try to include at least 25% more information and length to gain a clear advantage. If there's anything you can add to keep your visitors interested in the page (such as detailed product comparisons for example), then all the better.

There you have it. A 100% solid industry-standard guideline on what content you should have on your product and category pages. If there's anything missing, do let me know and I'll do my best to address it.

As a weekend/evening fiddle, I’m selling custom designed POD items (T shirts, phone cases and mugs) on eBay and am receiving a tidy little profit from this. 

I have a small Instagram page where I’ve organically grown to 2K followers around a niche I have recently really focused on. 

I’m wondering, does only selling on eBay put potential buyers off? Or alternatively, does it encourage more sales due to its security? 

If it would enhance my sales I’d love to dedicate some time to starting my own website, it’d really expand my experiences in ecommerce. Also, eBay has a 10% FVF (Final Value Fee) so a Shopify checkout would take a smaller portion.

2. Since my initial campaign was targetting MOBILE, I wanted to see which devices were performing the best - Maybe you need to edit your landing pages, sales pages etc to be more Mobile friendly for all devices regardless of their size across the board

ecommerce,How is your company calculating and filings online sales tax? (United States),"Hi everyone!

I’m in the process of replacing/improving my companies current process of calculating, reporting and filings for the different states sales tax requirements. With the recent “South Dakota v. Wayfair” decision we have been actively trying to take steps to make sure that we are collecting the correct sales tax amounts while registering and reporting in the different states of the customers we do business with.

I have been unable to find some good technical documents on the current best practices of online merchants for calculating or filing with the different states (Texas is the WORST!). And was wondering what some of the system or companies your business might have partner with or deployed.

Currently my company has been using an in-house sales tax database that is created &amp; updated from a ‘flat-file’ we purchased from Thomson Reuters (Originally from TaxDataSystems) that includes additional information for the different tax rates of states, city, county &amp; MTA/SPD (districts). This has allowed us to quickly calculate the correct total sales tax matched to the Zip+4 address.

However, recently Thomson Reuters had an error and no longer provides the MTA/SPD names &amp; reporting codes on the ‘flat-file’ they provide and now we are unable to correctly report the sales tax that we collect for the MTA/SPD.

When we have reached out to Thomson Reuters for support on this issue, it has been met with the response of “It will be fixed sometime in early 2019”. This is because they believe the file can still be used since it still has the correct tax rates broken down to the furthest level. Which is true for calculating &amp; collecting, but it does not help us with the reporting &amp; filing; Since we need to document the sales tax collected for the different states MTA/SPD based on the different names &amp; reporting codes.",8,7,2018-08-16,ECOM,0.04459159076213837,0.9276590943336487,0.02774931862950325

Hey guys,

I guess I'll start by telling you a bit about myself, briefly. I was born and raised on the west coast of Canada and was able to secure an athletic scholarship to play lacrosse in the United States. I finished my Bachelor's degree in Physical Education there last year and developed a keen interest in dropshipping while I was studying. I made my first sale during the holiday season dropshipping from an online retailer to eBay, but didn't have the ability to open my own Shopify store or fully dive in, due to time commitments with my sport and academics. Luckily enough, I was able to continue my education by pursuing a MSc in International Business in the United Kingdom and have continued to research the dropshipping industry throughout this year.

I'm just wrapping up the one year Master's right now, writing my dissertation. For the dissertation, I have chose to research the world of dropshipping. More specifically, I am looking to interview those who use dropshipping as their primary source of income. If I have trouble sampling this specific of a group, I may open the study up to those who operate a dropshipping business alongside their full-time job. I am hoping to better understand the motivations, daily operation, positives and negatives involved with this type of e-commerce. The interviews will be semi-structured in format, likely via very short (&lt;30 mins) Skype/phone call or email and all information given will remain entirely confidential and anonymous.

Thank you very much for your time!

shopify,Real Dropshipping Advice,"Hey guys,

I've been doing dropshipping for about a year, and I've been pretty happy with my success so far. I wanted to make this post to clear up any confusion people have, as people are really getting it twisted.

For those of you who don't like reading as this may be a long post, here's the video version:

[https://youtu.be/iTvhNi3ANZc](https://youtu.be/iTvhNi3ANZc)

I wanted to talk about this topic once and for all and start a discussion in this great community, so feel free to comment, upvote, downvote, whatever it may be to share your opinion.

I'm going to lay it out there, DROPSHIPPING IS HARD. There is no get rich quick scheme or ways to make money fast without any work. For example, nowadays I can create a successful Shopify store fairly quickly, but this is only because I've been through the failures and rough times and learned from my mistakes. I think experience is truly the best teacher.

In fact, one of my students couldn't figure out how to get sales, and sat down with her and asked her how much time she was spending. She said she spent a lot of time for a week, and if it didn't work, she moved on. I told her she needs patience. So, she spent 6 months tirelessly working on her store, and she's doing extremely well now. 

It takes hard work and patience. Most people forget about the patience part. When I started my first dropshipping store, I spent about 3 months and gave up. The next store I ran, I made a commitment to keep going, and I still have that store today, and has been one of my biggest revenue streams. 

Some other pointers:

In my opinion, it's time to move away from using the dog keychains, necklaces, etc. Even methods like Facebook ads and Instagram influencers have become extremely difficult to sustain. I am expirementing with Reddit ads, as I think it is an untapped audience great for marketing. I encourage you all to come up with different marketing methods such as Reddit, Pinterest, Groupon, etc.

And, one last thing I wanted to add is that blindly following Youtubers, mentors, course instructors, etc. is not a good idea. You have to create success for yourself and cannot just copy other people.

Secondly, is there a way I could update all the prices through a spreadsheet? Because we have a formula that we could make on Excel, and we'd get the costing for all combinations, all based on raw material prices (paper, ink, etc.) that we update weekly.

shopify,Need help with Inventory keeping on Shopify. Our products have several variants and not sure how to keep the count correct,"So for example one of our products is a type of ziplock bag, we'll call it Bag A. 

In our warehouse, we have 5,,000 of Bag A. 

On Shopify, we sell Bag A in variant quantities of 50,100,500,1000, and 5000. Each with increased price breaks for purchasing a bigger quantity.   


The problem we're running into is keeping a correct inventory count online because of the way the variants and shopify inventory seems to work( we could be wrong).   


The way I thought it would be is to set it up like so : 

(5,000 total of Bag A)

\-Variant 1 ""Qty 50"" : 100  (5,000/50)

\-Variant 2 ""Qty 100"" : 50 (5,000/100)

\-Variant 3 ""Qty 500"" : 10 (5,000/500)

\-Variant 4 ""Qty 1,000"" : 5 (5,000/1,000)

\-Variant 5 ""Qty 5,000"" : 1 (5,000/5,000)

I'm dividing the quantities from the overall inventory count. Because out of 5,000 bags we would have 100 50 packs we could sell, or 5 of the 1,000 packs. etc etc. 

But when you got back to Shopifys ""Product"" page, it show's ""166 in stock for 5 Variants""  when I'd like for this page to somehow show our entire onhand stock of 5,000 bags. 

Does anyone know how I can fix this? Obviously i'm doing something wrong. Maybe theres an simple or easy app to integrate that makes inventory tracking better. I've checked out Orderhive.

ecommerce,Recommendation about the order of an individual checkout process,"We're building an individual checkout process and due to technological limits (SAP, don't ask...) we can not A/B test something I would love to A/B test, so I hope to get some opinions. 

The checkout process consists out of 4 steps. 

1. Selection of service (simple, 1 or 2 interactions)
2. User data (shipping and billing address, additional information, lots of but very simply ""no-brainer"" text fields)
3. Delivery configuration (just 1 or 2 interactions but you'll have to double check against you calendar and might have questions about it)
4. Order overview and confirmation

I'm still unconsidered about the order of step 2 and 3. Is it better to place a large but easy form first or a smaller but from the view of the user more complex form first. 

As said, this would be a classical A/B testing thingy, but our framework doesn't allow to do so.

I'm about to launch my first ecommerce store this week and I'd like to include testimonials on the main page to build visitor confidence/trust. I don't want to write fake testimonials as that just doesn't sit right with me. However, the only testimonials I have are from coworkers at my office and family/friends who bought the product before the site launches.

I did read on their dropshipping page, that with their ""your own website"" dropshipping service you will pay $49 monthly, but only sourcing products won't cost anything, or at least thats how i understood it, so I chose dropshipping only, guess what I did get fined $49.

Next day I sent another email as a reminder, but no news since then.

I lost $49, and now I am not sure if I am going to be billed another $49 next month, maybe I should speak with my bank. I see that this $49 bank statement says its ""blocked until 10th October"", maybe they can source it back?

ecommerce,Critique my website that connects shoppers to niche ecommerce stores,"Hi guys, 

I am looking for some advice on my website, [Dowango](https://dowango.com). 

Dowango is a website that allows shoppers to discover niche e-commerce stores.

I have been working on it for the last few months and have recently improved its graphics. I ran some Facebook ads, which did not convert well. 

I understand that I need to fulfill a need for both sides before they find it to be useful. Shoppers would choose to use the website only if it has high quality stores, and high quality stores will only choose to be added if there is a strong presence of shoppers.  

As you are a part of the target audience, I would really appreciate if you could provide some feedback.

Would you or would you not use a website like this and why? Can the visuals be improved? How can it be improved to better meet your needs? What are your concerns about such a site?

dropship,"Tired of all the ""gurus"" out there funneling you in to sell you shit? I'm a suicide survivor and want to help others where I was never helped.","Seriously. No hidden motive here guys. Just genuine value :). I've helped thousands of people mostly on social media for completely free and have asked nothing in return. I'm happy to do that for you here as well.

​

Why do I do this? I was born with a crippling hormone disease, and was suicidal for most of my life. I left America with only a backpack, and while living in Southeast Asia, I cured my disease all on my own. For my whole life I was discarded by the people that were supposed to support me. I was given up on. I was fed to the wolves and attempted suicide as a result of it coupled with my disease.

I have never received any help with my disease OR with my success and ultimately breaking through, and I can take that energy and channel it into bitterness, or I can channel it into positivity and help save as many people from being scammed and save as many people from suffering as possible. The lack of support and help has continued on into ecommerce back when I was first learning. I want to help people avoid as much suffering as I've been through my entire life.

​

Do you guys dropship or run ecommerce stores?  [This little intro is 2 minutes so I can introduce myself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdaxfi8kAWY) I'd love if you take a look. I offer tons of value that all the ""gurus"" charge for. I give for free. I'm trying to build a community of like minded individuals hungry for success who want to learn without being funneled into the ""live webinars"" that aren't actually live, and all the other marketing tactics out there that are just trying to sell a course.

​

​

Some might say I'm trying to shill my Youtube channel, but that's a risk I'm going to take. Because I know how much value I offer and I put so much work into it for you guys and ask nothing in return. I know if I even impact one life positively here on reddit, that I can save a person a lot of heart ache so I will happily take accusations of being a shill for my channel.

​

I receive messages all of the time from people in tears because they have been ripped off by ""gurus"" who've sold them a dream. The ""gurus"" banned me from their facebook ""support"" groups when helping people within there because I helped too much. If I help to much for free, the people in the group are less likely to be susceptible to buying a course. There's value in some courses and I'm not knocking them, but let's be honest, 90% are scams and thousands is not tens of thousands of people a day are being scammed and dreams are being shattered. So I want to do my best to prevent that from here on out and would love if you joined me.

​

Anyway, I won't take up anymore of your time I know people don't like walls of text. But feel free to take a look at my little intro video so you can get to know me a bit. Come say hi if you'd like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdaxfi8kAWY) and just let me know here if I can help with anything! :D

&amp;#x200B;

A question for the more seasoned POD and ecomm members on this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently hiring sourcing graphic designers off of behance and dribble to create 4 canvas prints for me. When it comes time to budget I do not know what to say and instead I insist that they quote me their rate, because I've never worked with ""professional"" designers. I only have experience with the cheap designers you find on Fiverr and various other POD websites.

&amp;#x200B;

How much should I budget for these guys? Do you pay them an hourly rate or do you pay a lump sum for the project?

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of doing a deliverables system where we I pay them a portion for a first draft, second draft, and then a final.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, how do you guys transfer ownership of the designs? Is there a legal document you use to ensure you own the copy right to the final design?

shopify,I work at Shopify and I am getting sick of some things.,"I work remote support. We are just the car washers. The valet in the parking lot. We are the “kind of with the company” but “just support people” who are scoffed at. We are the shit scrapers who deal with the pissed-off merchants when the developers let something crash or break because they are playing ping pong. 

We are the ones who need to talk on the phone, perpetuating this lie that Risk banned them for a good reason that we can’t really tell because of security (often they ban you out of a hunch but we can not say that.) 

We are the ones having to calm down the people who call up, angry because the servers went down for the millionth time or your crap themes are misbehaving. 

We are the ones with a joke of a training period while 95 percent of what we’re actually faced with, is learned on-the-fly, while we bullshit the caller as if we see what is going on. 

We are the ones who never handled the Point of Sale equipment yet supposed to troubleshoot when people call with problems, as we blind-guess with flow charts on the desktop and the real experts are never dealing with those such calls or chats when they should. 

No structure. A generalist frontline. No cost-of-living raises. No mandatory review where you get a raise or don’t. It’s possible you will go years without one. Start building your case and hope randomly on no particular schedule, you’ll be heard. Often you’ll get it on the grounds someone likes you, not because you worked hard. Shopify is too hip for classic values that actually do good. 

Nobody takes the support job at Shopify to stay in it. I hate to break it to you. If they tell you otherwise, they are lying. We want to move up. We got in to get around. An hour lunch would be nice as everyone else at the company gets that and remote support only gets thirty minutes (a minor pain). It would also be nice to have a normal work week like every other team gets and maybe one could not work every stat holiday since we work every goddamned one. It would be nice if longterm work resulted in perks in these areas. 

Oh quit telling the few support reps who work at HQ to not tell remote workers about the perks you offer at HQ. The free eats and drinks, the beer, the silly slide and diversions, all those benefits on site, because you’ll think we’ll be “jealous”. We already know and don’t give a shit. It’s the rest of it that pisses us off. 

Some people in remote support have managed to luck out and get advancement so its possible. It is also possible to get chosen from the audience on Price Is Right or win the lotto. Its fun to watch those chosen few get there and then never speak to the lowly support reps again. Like a golden ticket or the waterfall in Mad Max. 

What is hilarious is how people who advanced often have shitty records as support reps. Its because they know a friend in many cases. Meanwhile, people who work extra hard, stay polite, with a great record, are like ghosts. Solution? Know people, but it’s hard enough when you are a remote. It is dead end my friend. 

If you say any of this it’s like Scientology. It’s The Circle. They will pump you full of Kool Aid and tell you “Quit expecting better. Are you not glad you have a job? Are you not here for the team? What about the merchants? Are you not here for the holy mantra we post everywhere? Do you not want to suck Tobi off?” 

They monitor this Reddit, make accounts, finagle reviews on the web, plant good stories. Reputation management. All for the stock market. I get it. I don’t even blame you.

I currently live in Marrakech, Morocco and have access to a wide variety of natural cosmetic products ranging from Argan oil, argan shampoos and body lotions to natural soaps and many other natural certified products.

dropship,AliExpress users - How do you deal with the long shipping window?,"Hey guys, 

I'm just wondering how those of you who drop-ship using AliExpress deal with the long shipping windows. 

When looking at products to sell, it seems that the vast majority of them have ship times (to the client) of weeks!  I would think that this would make for a bad user experience and very poor return customer rates.

How do you guys deal with this? Do you warn the customer in advance? Do you show them as ""back-ordered""? Do you just let the chips fall where they may and hope the shipping windows is smaller than the estimate? 

I know there are items from AliExpress that are shipped from the US or Europe, and that they have shorter ship windows, but when looking for items that fit your theme/niche, you don't want to be limited by where the physical items exist, right?  


The corollary to that question is, has anyone started with AliExpress and moved to another Drop Ship marketplace because of the extended shipping times.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance

Doug

ecommerce,regarding item sourcing/fulfillment/drop shipping (your opinion is wanted!),"first of all i hope im not breaking any rules by posting this here; if so i apologize (reddit is somewhat intimidating and it seems like it is pretty easy to embarrass yourself in front of people who know what theyre talking about)  


for the past two years ive been importing various fashion items through 1688 and selling them in israel with the help of shopping agents for small businesses. while it provided something to do and made for some decent profit, im interested in expanding my business to an internet store type thing, focusing on item sourcing from 1688, perhaps hosted on the storenvy platform or something similar (not shopify)

&amp;#x200B;

what i wonder is, does anyone here have any insights on what type of service fits my needs? basically, what im looking for is:  
1. a company to buy items on my behalf from [1688](https://1688.cn)  
2. a warehouse and repackaging service  
3. cheap shipping, as i intend on selling relatively cheap items (mostly under 15$ including shipping)

ecommerce,Building a new e-commerce site in 2018 - what platform to choose?,"Background: I've been running an e-commerce site together with a non-technical partner for the past couple of years. We are currently running on an outdated osCommerce platform, and so I want to switch to a new, modern platform. I'm a senior backend developer with basic frontend development knowledge, however I have a full time job and so I cannot choose an option which will require more than a couple of hours per week to maintain/develop (not counting the initial setup/building phase). The optimal platform would be simple enough for a non-technical person to be able to do simple things like change images, upload new products, change the copy and so forth, while at the same time being flexible enough to have the possibility to program new features in the site on my own when or if that would be needed. Mostly though, using extensions will be enough to cover our needs.

​

To summarize, the optimal platform would:

\- Be easy for a non-technical person to work with on a day to day basis

\- Allow a non-technical person to do simple changes like uploading new frontpage pictures, changing copy e.t.c.

\- Have a rich set of extensions for various integrations and features

\- Be open source, or in some other way allow me to code new features when/if needed

\- Have an offering of design templates to start working with (design/frontend is not my strong suit)

​

Thanks in advance!

ecommerce,Can I get your feedback on a low-cost marketing idea?,"In the past few months I've been consulting for a couple of clients and helping them with influencer marketing. They wanted to have more of a ""natural presence"" on Instagram and Facebook, but didn't have the money to pay for a big influencer and didn't have the time to reach out to hundreds of ""microinfluencer"".

I came up with the idea to use their customers as influencers - and together we built a system that would automatically ask customers if they'd post a photo to Instagram or Facebook after they bought their product. When they did, we'd verify the photo and send them a discount code for money off their next order.

This worked pretty well - we had a decent response rate without really putting a lot of work into the solution, and we also saw our Instagram hashtags become more popular and definitely more ""genuine"" as it was regular people posting photos and not blatant advertising.

What do you guys think of this idea? I'm in the processing of building it out (starting out with Shopify, but the principle applies to all ecommerce) and I want to talk to as many shop owners as possible to really understand the need (instead of jumping into an idea that only worked for a handful of consulted clients).

shopify,10 Ways to Increase Your Shopify Store Conversion Rate,"Here’s a simple explanation of why you should care about your store conversion rate:
 
Let’s say you receive 1,000 website visitors a day and have a 1% conversion rate — that’s 10 sales.
 
Now let’s say that you only receive 500 website visitors a day, but you’ve increased your conversion rate to 2% — that’s still 10 sales, but with HALF the traffic!
 
If your traffic was the same at 1,000 visitors a day and you had a 2% conversion rate, you’d DOUBLE your sales without driving in any additional traffic.
 
Keep in mind that the average conversion rate for each store and industry varies and the above numbers are just an example to show you the importance of focusing on improving your conversion rate.
 
Now that you can see the importance of focusing on increasing your conversion rate, let’s begin with our 5 strategies to helping you increase your conversion rate.

shopify,What do you think of this Shipping application that Integrates with your Shopify store?,"Hi, I'm my name is Austin Hoyle.  Over the last two years I have built [AMS.WebShip](https://www.amswebship.com).  AMS Webship is a web application meant to save users money on shipping while streamlining the shipping process.  It is fully compatible with Desktop and tablet configurations.  One of webship's particularly robust integrations is with Shopify.

&amp;#x200B;

The two biggest advantages to using WebShip are:

* Saving Money on shipping(no subscription fees, no label fees, and discounted shipping rates).  You are almost guaranteed to save money, especially if you are using something like ShipHero,  ShipStation etc. or Shopify's built in solution.
* Speeding up/Simplifying the shipping process, saving you time.

&amp;#x200B;

The Shopify Integration supports:

* Full order synchronization/updates.
* Real-time order synchronization the moment orders are created.
* Items that are refunded are removed from the corresponding Shopify order in Webship in real -time.
* Orders that are fully refunded are removed from Webship in real-time.
* Item info synchronization.
* Filter out pre-orders until you're ready to ship/have them in stock.
* Easily filter orders and search for them by Item names, Order Number, Customer Name etc.
* Batch orders together to purchase labels for all of them at once(this allows for differing package dimensions, shipping services etc.  You can even batch orders together from different ecommerce platforms as well as csv imports all at once.).
* Orders are immediately fulfilled in Shopify when the label is purchased in WebShip.
* Utilize pick/pack/ship process to verify orders item by item before shipping. (Compatible with barcode scanner.)

dropship,If you aren't using Dynamic Product Ads you are leaving money on the table,"Hey, everyone! 

I have been going through this sub-reddit over the past few weeks trying to find something valuable to share with you. I see that many aren't utilising retargeting and if they do, they aren't using DPAs (Dynamic Product Ads).

&amp;#x200B;

# What are Dynamic Product Ads?

It is a solution designed to help advertisers “promote multiple products or their entire product catalog, across the all the devices customers use”.  These ads can target certain products to specific audiences depending on where they are in the marketing funnel. Simply put, with Dynamic Ads you can rest assure that Facebook will automatically deliver the most relevant products to your audience. 

# How do Dynamic Product Ads work?

The “magic” behind it is simple. They pair a product ID to a user ID and this helps create highly personalised ads. The best of all? In addition to saving a lot of time and being more accurate and precise than if you were to create Mutli-Product Ads, they use up-to-date pricing and availability. 

# How to get started with Dynamic Product Ads

You need a product catalogue and a product feed. DON'T GET SCARED. You don't need a programmer. You can totally do it on your own. You can create a feed in an excel sheet.

# Are Dynamic Product Ads really successful? 

Yes, I have tried them with a variety of clients and have had up to 20% - 25% ROAS. Just from retargeting:

1. People who viewed last 7 days excl. people who added to cart
2. People who added to cart last 7 days excl. people who purchased
3. People who purchased a certain product and show them a complementary product. (cross- sell).

&amp;#x200B;

We have tried Dynamic Ads for a variety of industries (betting companies, real estate, e-com etc.) and DPAs are part of our e-com strategy. 

&amp;#x200B;

PRO TIP: You can even style your DPAs and pair them with Facebook's offer ad format to make them more engaging and set your ad apart..

Feedback so far has been positive, but it's mostly been from friends and family. I'd love to get some un-biased feedback from you folks! I have my own list of things I know I could improve, but I wanted to make sure I focus my efforts in the right place.

A little background on the business: Currently I am the sole ""employee"". I design and manufacture everything in my shop in Maine, with the exception of the jewelry which is manufactured in NYC. My goal is to offer an alternative to the ""handmade boutique"" market with things that are more affordably priced, without sacrificing quality. Rather than handmaking every item (which is expensive) I use small-batch manufacturing techniques like CNC, casting, and laser cutting to automate things that robots are good at, and hand-finishing everything to make sure it's perfect.

shopify,Do you think product recommendations work for online stores?,"Hello. My name is Anoushka Chopra and I work for Outgrow. It is basically an interactive marketing tool that lets you create quizzes and calculators without coding.

We have just launched an Ecommerce Recommendations feature. The idea behind it is that instead of making your customers go through hundreds of products, how about you create recommendation quizzes for them? (I've seen Amazon do this. In fact, a staggering 35% of their revenue is generated via recommendation quizzes) Instead of just generic filters, a quiz can be more personalized.

For eg, for sunglasses, it quiz can have questions like the shape of your face, the sunglasses your favorite actor is wearing, your budget etc.

Basically, making life easy for the customers.

Good idea or not? This is just the link to the Product Hunt page, I DO NOT wish to spam here.  r/http://bit.ly/2PhXFPd 

What I do ask for though, is your feedback! Do you think recommendation quizzes are something that could work/have worked for your online store? Would you use them?

ecommerce,How do clients ask for a refund through their banks ?,"Hello,  


I currently have an online store using Stripe payment gateway. However, as some of you might know Stripe has a very low tolerance for refund requests.  


That been said, there are some scammers a few and then that order and ask for a refund the next day through their bank ! Which is something i never thought was possible. I used to think that it's only possible to make a refund request through the gateway and website directly.  


When Stripe receives a refund request from the bank they don't argue, they give the money back with no questions asked.  


To help me understand these scammers better, i would like to know how exactly is it possible to ask for a refund through the bank, are there any specific procedures that someone should follow in order to get his refund or are the refund requests granted to anybody who ask for them ?

dropship,Use Dynamic Creative optimisation to automate ad copy and creative testing,"Many people gave a nice feedback about the previous post that I decided to share a new tip with you all!

I think you will like this feature since it will allow you to cut down the time it takes you to create new ads. 

# What is Dynamic Creative?

Dynamic Creative or Dynamic Creative optimisation is Facebook's feature that enables you to automatically create multiple variations of an ad’s creative and then serve the best combination for each targeted person. From your side you need to provide Facebook with an asset feed that contains images (up to 10), texts (up to 10), headlines (up to 10), descriptions (up to 10), 1 CTA and 1 Website URL and Facebook will automatically “mix and match” them in order to create all possible variations.

# Why use Dynamic creative?

Because the algorithm will find a win combination for you and run it to the right audience. 

# What campaigns should I use Dynamic Creative with?

We have tried dynamic creative with prospecting campaigns mainly. The reason for this is because Facebook wants big audiences to be able to optimise. 

I have used it for promoting websites, mobile app, and getting leads and have seen great results. 50%lower CPI, 6x lower CPL, 30% increase in ROI. I have also used it across a variety of industries and had seen great results.

That's it! It is super easy to use it. I use it to find the winning combination and I then use it as a standalone ad in my campaigns.

If you have any questions comment them below.

PS: Let me know what you'd like to see me explain and I will turn it into a post if many people are interested.",0,5,2018-08-29,ECOM,0.02148052677512169,0.9352520108222961,0.043267518281936646

How to setup an online store when shipping needs to be manually calculated each time, based on the wholesaler &amp; customer's location? 

Products are heavy and fragile costing between $1-2K. Shipping (fulfilled by the wholesalers) is also expensive (e.g. $150 to France). Wholesalers are located in US and Canada, and possibly more countries in the future. 

Right now, instead of an online cart I ask customers to email me their address. I communicate the address to the wholesaler for a shipping quote. Once I get the quote, I email that back to the customer.

ecommerce,To Ecommerce Entrepreneurs Selling In Canada/US: What software/apps do you use to run your business? Orders/Inventory/Shipping Management/Operations!,"Hi everyone!

I have a few friends in the eCommerce space selling in both Canada and the US. They are growing quick but would like advice on how to best automate/optimize their customer order/purchasing/shipping management process using the best apps/software available, while also ensuring this integrates well with their accounting systems (Quickbooks Online/Xero). In other words, they're facing operational bottlenecks right now by using manual processes too much with their teams through spreadsheets etc. to manage a lot of things. 

​

**Some details about their businesses:**

\- Low variety of products, selling only 1-5 different skus.

\- Selling between 30-1000 orders per month.

\- For Canada, primarily Canada Post is used to ship.

\- For the US, they primarily use Shipbob (fulfillment, inventory, orders etc.).

\- Channels used to sell: either WooCommerce with Wordpress or Shopify, with possible addition of Amazon in the future.

\- Accounting system used: Quickbooks Online/Xero

\- Combination of drop shipping + small amount of inventory across a few warehouses in Canada/US to be fulfilled by third party providers. No need to consider work in progress inventory, only finished goods are bought by them and then sold to customers. 

\- # of Suppliers used for products: less than 5

​

**What they're hoping for:**

\- Customer Orders - Would like to see customer orders and customer invoices from all channels (for example, if they sell on both Amazon and Shopify) in one place, see customer details,, shipping status + ability to change shipping status. Bonus points if it is automatically updated by a 3PL or something (e.g. Shipbob does this for woocommerce, but only for US orders).

\- Inventory - to have inventory automatically updated regardless of which sales channel it comes from.

\- Shipping/Shipping Status - Ability to have order status automatically be updated once shipped by ShipBob or Canada Post/Fedex/UPS, or manually done if integration does not exist. Upon shipping status change, to have an email automatically sent to the customer with shipping information + tracking.

\- Purchasing/Restocking - Ability to automatically create POs to be sent to suppliers when inventory hits critical level. Automatic reminders to restock. Etc.

\- Accounting - to be integrated with Quickbooks Online if possible (or Xero), such that customer orders/supplier purchases/inventory or cost of sales are synced at least monthly (the more frequent the better) along with appropriate tax rates.

\- Any other crucial feature I might be missing that you may be aware of as an experienced retailer.

\- Overall goal is to reduce google sheets completely, and manua POs/manual order tracking/manual shipment updates.

​

To end off, is this even possible? I feel like it's asking or a lot from one software, but these things are so important to have automated as much as possible for scalability and I'd imagine would help a TON of ecommerce retailers be more successful. If any of you use one or multiple software to achieve the goals above based on our situation, please let us know what we should look into or what stack of apps we should use (the less the better of course)! After researching online, there seems to be all sorts of different software that we're unable to properly sift through/vet them to see if they would meet our needs - e.g. Stitch Labs, Ordoro, Dear Inventory, Trade Gecko (if any of you use these, let us know what you like or dislike about them too!).

ecommerce,Best CMS for local bakery web orders?,"I work for a small but growing independent bakery. We make cakes, donuts, pastries, etc. A big part of our business is orders for pick-up/delivery at a future date, and we need to roll out web ordering to more efficiently keep pace with demand, which we currently can’t do as our Squarespace site doesn’t provide the needed functionality.

Customers can now order in-store and by phone, but our only web options are 1) emailing us or 2) submitting a form through our site, both of which require us to call the customer to place the order with them manually over the phone, which provides a less than ideal customer experience and is an unnecessary and labor-intensive step.

One of the main obstacles preventing us from rolling out web ordering is integrating it with production. Our production capacity is finite, so we often have to stop taking orders for a particular day/time once order volume reaches a certain limit. This needs to somehow automatically update in real time on the site so the customer can’t choose a pick-up/delivery date that's already booked.

It seems to me the solution here is to find a CMS that will integrate with POS and invoicing software--both of which we’re also shopping for--but other than that I'm kind of at a dead end. So I guess my questions are:

* Which CMS should I be looking into that may provide the functionality we need? I’m currently researching Wordpress/Woocommerce (to possibly integrate with something like Clover POS + Xero) but with additional locations and other confounding variables on the horizon, I'm not sure something like this would be robust enough.
* This may prove to be beyond our capabilities to implement on our own, and I'm not sure if an off-the-shelf solution is the answer. If we were to bring someone in--what kind of firm/consultant would we reach out to?

ecommerce,Video Reviews,"Howdy all,

I'm looking to gauge interest on a service to collect video reviews for e-commerce stores. Last year I built a tool to help my father's e-commerce store collect video reviews for his products and thought perhaps this could be something I sell as a service. Curious what site owners think about this, if there is value to it, and what (if any) trouble you've had working with video or gathering reviews.

ecommerce,"Has anyone used Printful for their “successful” stores, or are you happy with another POD service?","I really like their product selection but I saw some negative reviews on the Shopify app section about shipping times, orders being lost, etc. Many positive reviews were from people that haven’t even made a sale yet but were instead praising the dashboard, integration, mock-up generator etc. Is there any other POD service I should consider?!

dropship,Need some help,"So i've gotten into dropshipping recently and have learnt that dropshipping isn't the best thing ever when it comes to new sellers, since i've found a product thats selling really well (too well) i've gotten my account limited on paypal due to the recent spike in my sales because of the new product and even after submiting the required documents to paypal i've still had no luck getting my account back so eventually I decided to start a brand new paypal account which didn't go well since it got limited after 2 sales due to it being a new account so what i'm looking for right now is to find a paypal account to use for dropshipping or a partner with an account thats willing to work together and share the profit, PM if interested.",11,3,2018-08-31,ECOM,0.03625597804784775,0.8801461458206177,0.08359779417514801
woocommerce,Shipping by weight and by postcode/zipcode,Can anybody suggest a plugin that will allow me to calculate a shipping cost based on weight and postcode? My shipping company charges different prices for shipping to different postcodes in the UK and also the charge increases depending on weight. I have looked at shipping zones which seems to allow me to specify the costs to certain postcodes which is great but I am missing the functionality to alter this based on the weight of the products ordered.

dropship,Influencer shoutouts? how to provide your ads to the influencer,"sincere apologies ahead of time if this has already been answered. (if that's the case please link the thread) 

I'm just spending like 16+ hours a day trying to set up a legitimate store (also my first store ever) and cover all the bases and this could really put stick in my spokes.

I've successfully contacted some influencers and I realized I have no idea how this process works. I understand payment, and paypal via e-mail, but I haven't actively used Instagram since like March 2016 and I don't want to make any moves and get caught looking like a fool or get taken advantage of on something that should be second nature.

I've already started making ads, picture and video (I have access to the adobe CC suite so creation is heavenly) 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get the ads to the influencer? do I just e-mail them the files?  what types of ads will they accept? can I send them a carousel? (I didn't even know they were called carousels until about 5 minutes ago) 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

is it common for influencers to copy your products? I contacted an influencer and it appears that while I've been fine tuning my site to look as trustworthy as possible, they threw together a site based around the main product i had planned on creating an ad for. they don't mention any other instagram pages, or company names and the site only lists 2 products, the main one is one of my main products. honestly im not worried about it, like thanks for warming up your audience to my store that lists the same product for 20% cheaper. it just seems scummy?",5,3,2018-08-31,ECOM,0.02895686775445938,0.9387876987457275,0.03225545212626457
