ecommerce,E-commerce store performance optimization. Free for first 2 customers.,"I hope you know  this.

Researchers have found that when people arrive at a website, on average 50% of them will leave that website within 8 seconds. In other words, if your website doesn't do something WITHIN 8 SECONDS to keep them there, at least 50% of them will leave. For you, it could even be 60%, 80% . It could be over 90% if your website is slow or lagging. Moreover slow website tends to loose your potential customers. Other side effects could be loss of trust, decrease in search engine rankings and increase in customer frustration.

I am expert in tuning websites and online stores' performance. I am starting a business and looking for valuable feedback from genuine early customers. For this reason I am doing FREE performance optimization for the first 2 e-commerce stores.

If your website is slow and needs a boost then PM me with your website address and email ID. I will get back to you in shortest possible time.

ecommerce,"I would like to offer my customers a retroactive discount for posting an honest review. Is this ""allowed"" in ecommerce? More details inside...","I run a sole proprietorship with an online storefront, which produces and sells high quality custom leatherwork.



My products have always gotten positive reviews and I always get a few sales from the reviews posted on internet forums. In fact, a lot of my website's traffic is from links in reviews. This got me thinking; I could have Shoppify automatically send a customer an email, 4 weeks after their order was shipped, which offers a retroactive 10% discount on their existing order if they post an honest review of my product on my business's facebook page or on any internet forum and send me a link.



I don't believe there is anything morally wrong with this since I'm just trying to accurately and independently inform interested consumers.



So here are my questions for the community:



1) How do you think customers would feel about this?



2) Should I state in the e-mail that the review should have a disclaimer explaining the discount program (and how my sponsorship doesn't affect the content of the review)?



I think this whole concept could be applied to many ecommerce businesses, but I've never seen it done, so I'm left wondering why that is so and if its a good idea at all.

PlumbZilla is an online buying site for commercial plumbing supplies. We have over 1500 parts on the site, and the site (I feel) is optimized for conversion rate.... But we barely do any business. The company that funds it does the same thing except sends salesman out to NC, SC, and VA, and that company does over 3 million a year in sales. There is no reason why the site shouldn't generate a bunch more revenue.

That SEO ran us 750 a month for several months before we decided that we were paying to much for what we were getting. We are on an extremely tight budget now that we have spent 4 years of paying for the site and 2 ad campaigns with not much revenue. Is there something that I'm doing wrong?

ecommerce,Switching from woo commerce to shopify,"I began building my store with WordPress and have just recently finished inputting all of my products, I am now finding shopify and after testing it for a few hours it seems a lot easier and a much better platform for my store.

However I have my hosting through web hosting hub which I have already paid for 2 years of hosting. It seems with shopify that they do all of your hosting in their monthly fee.

 what is my best way to switch over, 

how hard would it be to transfer my products (I have 40 plus SKUs),

 with shopify including hosting would I be wasting money with my own hosting pointing my domain to their servers ?

ecommerce,Need help: I have an idea for a one-page e-commerce service. What do you think?,"Trying various marketplaces (themeforest, opencart.com) for selling my digital products I ended quite unhappy with them. Especially with the lack of control they gave me over the presentation of my product, the crippled communication with potential customers and most of all—no control over payment processing. Not to forget the hefty share of profit that’s being taken... 

Then it struck me—maybe I should scratch my own itch and solve my own problem. 

So the following idea emerged: why not marry the landing pages with e-commerce product pages thus creating a landing page that can actually sell your product(has a Buy Now button, no cart, one step checkout and so on). I called it ProductPage and you can find it here [http://productpage.simplelander.com/](http://productpage.simplelander.com/)

I would be very happy if you could give me some feedback.

ecommerce,protecting myself from fraud?,"I run an ecommerce business selling furniture, which is difficult to ship via UPS/Fedex for obvious reasons. A customer placed an order online, and it was flagged as suspicious for a variety of reasons. 

I tried calling the CC issuing company (Discover) and they wouldn't deny or verify any information, so I'm not really sure what to do. How can I protect myself here?

Best option I suppose is to just cancel and void the order. Other than that, what are my other options? If I have the order delivered to the customer and have the delivery person verify customer identity and get a signature, would that protect me? I can't use UPS/Fedex (as stated before) so it would be a little different than normal...

ecommerce,"Using Storenvy, Shopify, or Woocommerce?","I've been working on my storenvy site in the hope that I could sell some hobby-related items, but I'm beginning to feel like storenvy is a bit limited in what it can do. 

I looked at Shopify, but I don't think I can afford the monthly payment for a hobby shop. As for woocommerce, I'm playing with it on my computer to get a feel for it. 

My main draw to Storenvy is the marketplace, which I personally think allows for multiple avenues of discovery (maybe? idk). 

What do you guys think? Maybe I should start small then move to something else if I get bigger? I'm new to all of this.

I've encountered numerous problems thus far, the first was I needed to have a company or be a sole trader, voila, I am now a sole trader. Beyond this though, almost every supplier I have found want VAT registration information, do suppliers require you to be VAT registered? Because it sure seems that way. 

Other than that they ask for trade references and or a company invoice, I assume this is to see that you actually make money and are worth their while.

ecommerce,Amazon Seller's Horror Stories,"If you have experience selling in Amazon, you know how f_ck3d up their biased are towards buyers. Without due process or any sort of preliminary investigation they will side towards buyers with ridiculous scammy claims such as not receiving shipments that required a signature,  late shipping complaints minutes after buying the product, warranty claims years after buying the product and bunch of other fraudulent claims that will make any Amazon seller's business miserable. You can NOT dispute or defend yourself because they are ""AMAZON"". No amount of evidence or proof from your side will make them consider your case and they will stand by their decision to either suspend you from selling or permanently ban you from selling because they don't effin care. To add insult to injury, Amazon will demand that you bend over even more and prepare an action plan to supposedly improved on where you failed on(getting scammed I guess) even when there's absolutely no fault on your part. Sadly Amazon now is turning into a haven for scammers and fraudsters. 

What's your Amazon horror story?",12.0,3,2013-08-27,ECOM,0.2105017602443695,0.7654667496681213,0.024031411856412888

ecommerce,"would like some insight, on a new business I started online. (cross post from r/startup)","So My mom started a business in 87 which would amount to becoming a franchise known as Beauty Empire, We sell wigs weaves extensions and all sorts of beauty supplies, which is mostly sold to black women. through out the years her business expanded and has over 20 locations in our city and we just started to expand our business online, my sole reason is to make the online business successful.
www.beautyempire3.com is the Site I started up a couple days ago, and Its been tough to say the least.
I understand that online businesses are a whole new game for me. completely the opposite from our storefront, which gets customers basically every minute... but so far, only 1 customer online since we opened up. I mean we started with only around 10-20 unique visitors a day and would soon follow to the last couple of days getting 40-60 uniques and jumping to 100 and todays 170 and counting uniques.
I have been self advertising currently, trying to find online communities to expose my business too but no one seems to be biting?
I have tried social media and such, its slowly growing, this sites barely a month old I would say, still in development, What could I do to increase sales and increase productivity?
any ideas
this is my first online business and I hope to make it a good one.
tl;dr Family owns a big business physically, 20 plus stores, but online its a ghost town, wat do. (spelling and grammar) sorry.


EDIT:update, just things i've learned
