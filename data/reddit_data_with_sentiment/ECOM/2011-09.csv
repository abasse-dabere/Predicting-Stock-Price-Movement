ecommerce,Total Beginner Questions - Ecommerce,"Hello ecommerce subreddit,

I am thinking about starting an ecommerce website and have some very basic questions. I am hoping that you can either offer advice, point me in the direction of some useful tutorials, or point me to a different subreddit!

1) If I am trying to learn skills to develop my own site, where should I start? Do I need to learn html? web design? any specific software? Is there a platform that you would recommend learning so that I can be as independent as possible in my business platform?

2) For payment options and business set up, are there any tips I can follow to reduce my initial costs? I am not well versed on tax information, and I am wondering if setting up in one state (US) versus another if advantageous. Also, for online payment methods, is paypal the standard I need to follow? 

3) Any general advice for someone who had very little experience, so that I can educate myself would be very helpful!

Thanks a lot!",0,1,2011-09-15,ECOM,0.01706312969326973,0.9215096235275269,0.061427220702171326

ecommerce,"First time setting up shop. Stuck with Paypal for processing right now, need help with cart and promo codes!","So I'm looking into setting up a small shop to sell some parts for airsoft replicas. The exact specifics of it are not important, but basically I sell small bumpers that I cut myself out of rubber. I've been running the business through a couple of forums right now, and that works well but it's hard to keep track of all of the messages and everything. I'd like to have a small website where people can place their orders. There are 3 parameters that the customer needs to select per bumper that they buy, and typical orders are for 3-9 different types of bumper.

The problem is this: one of the main selling points of my business so far has been that I offer a buy-5-get-1 free deal to everyone. How on earth would I go about setting up a shopping cart for this? I would like it to be able to automatically determine the number of bumpers in the cart and apply discounts by itself.

As for payment, right now I'm stuck with Paypal. It's worked well so far, and honestly a lot of my customers have money in their Paypal accounts, but don't have credit cards, so I need to be able to accept both Paypal money and credit cards. Therefore: the shopping cart software I use must be able to work well with Paypal.

The last tidbit is that my solution must be very cheap/free/open source. The site will be very small, and something like the cheapest Squarespace would work perfectly, maybe even a Google site. My monthly income is very small right now, so paying someone to set something up is out of the question. I have some experience with basic HTML, but nothing fancy.

All that said- are there any good DIY solutions for what I'm looking for? I appreciate any help or pointers in this, as I'd like my first foray into ecommerce to be a good one!",6,2,2011-09-26,ECOM,0.020979907363653183,0.9293165802955627,0.04970357567071915
