ecommerce,Knowing the user journey is key to eCommerce success,"Hi. I work for a behavioral analytics firm and would be happy to answer any questions you have as it relates to eCommerce. 

I always stress the importance of monitoring user behavior and think that knowing that Sally found your brand on Pinterest in July, bought an item on Amazon in August and liked your page in September is paramount to segmenting your users and sending them personalized push notifications for example.

woocommerce,Can't change default text in attribute dropdown,"Product = Variable Subscription w/ up to 2 different attributes:

&amp;nbsp;

Roast type (all, light, medium, dark)  &lt;-- some products)  
Delivery Frequency (weekly, delivered every 2 weeks, delivered every 3 weeks, monthly)  &lt;-- all products

&amp;nbsp;

Right now ""Choose an Option"" shows up as the top option. Would love to figure out how to set this differently for each variation.  If I use one of the options as the default, the ""Choose and Option"" is still visible as the first option.

&amp;nbsp;

Goal: to replace ""Choose an option"" with ""Select Roast"" for 1st dropdown variable selector and ""Select Delivery Frequency"" for the 2nd dropdown variation option.

&amp;nbsp;

Added difficulty, my original developer (who is no longer on the project) implemented LayersPro to save time, it has been a struggle to work with/around this. New developer is saying that it would be a BAD idea to remove LayersPro at this point.

Marketer B - focuses mainly on ads, also top reated on upwork but with less total jobs, only taking care of the ads and not the site, but he is currently working with a store that is nearly identical to ours in terms of products and gets great results after 3 months (around 300% ROI)

Working with a woo commerce site that in addition to selling a bundled product also sells individuals of the item in the bundle. Both have their own SKU's and when a bundle is bought the distribution receives an order that is 6 x individual item - packed as 1 x Bundle.

The issue in woo commerce however is that the sales data counts both the bundle and the individual item. For example selling 4 x Bundles would also mean 24 singles also appear in the sales data.

Is there a way of stopping Woo commerce from tracking items included in a bundle as individual purchases as well? the way it is currently set-up is that the Bundle - grabs the SKU of 6 singles when its triggered.",0,2,2017-08-01,ECOM,0.03108227625489235,0.9377040863037109,0.031213607639074326

shopify,First time marketing problem,"So like many others I've decided to give dropshipping a try, and I've picked what I believe to be a great niche, and completed my website - but now I've hit the hurdle of marketing.

I was so caught up in getting content onto the site and making sure everything else was up to scratch, I neglected to think about how I'd actually reach customers. For some reason in my mind I'd just skipped along with the mentality of ""if you build it they will come"". 

The realization has now hit (a week after launch) that given the average price of my products, there's actually no way of making money via advertising, as the average CPC would be higher than the margin I expect to make on the average order. Of course as I haven't had any orders yet, I can only extrapolate based on industry averages I've found for eCommerce.

My question is thus: in this scenario is it more wise to abandon the venture and move on?

ecommerce,No clue how to save our business.,"Ok guys, I need help. I’ve inherited partial responsibility of a very outdated website and am not sure the best way to move forward. My boss is stuck in this decision and is turning to me for advice, but I have no real experience with this- I run the fulfillment/customer service for the website. 

We’re a small business with a storefront and online presence. Our store has been in business for 35 years and our website was originally created in 1999. There have been 3 iterations of our website, and our current development team tells us that the generations were just stacked on top of each other- basically the code is a nightmare (so everything naturally costs more than usual). I don’t claim to understand this.

Our current site is terrible. It’s clunky to work with, difficult to navigate, and non-responsive. At the moment, our current development team is offering an update and redesign for ~20k. They basically told us that without a substantial financial investment, our site will fail. 

My boss is gun-shy because we have spent a LOT of money on ‘fixing’ the site over the last 20 years. Unfortunately, some people were trusted that shouldn’t have been trusted. They basically screwed us over and bailed.

I’m sorry if this is somewhat vague- I’m happy to provide any information or answer any questions. The only guidance we currently have is coming from our development team who honestly don’t seem to care. We're at a very crucial crossroads with the website and feel ill-equipped to decide on a path forward.

dropship,Competition reported a photo I used in a wildly successful ad for copyright infringement,"So I've got this explosively successful ad creative with thousands of engagements, positive comments, feedback with photos, etc. I've been using it successfully in dozens of Facebook ad sets, generating high ROI. 

Out of nowhere, I'm hit with a DMCA takedown notice via Facebook from someone claiming to have the copyright over the photo I used in my ad. The ad itself is a collage of different model + product photos I took personally. Suddenly, my ad sets are all slaughtered. To appeal, Facebook offers a link to a DMCA Counter Claim form. 

My suspicion is that a sizeable competitor in my niche reported me to kill my momentum. Someone I've been monitoring put up a very similar post that exploded in popularity over a very short timeframe, indicating traffic is being purchased - and that's my traffic being diverted. 

Now, I filed a counter claim, but the stipulation is that you have to wait 10-14 business days for a response from the other party before Facebook restores your content (they say they regret situations where they just lose your data). That is, unless the other person replies with their permission. 

I've emailed the person multiple times with the email they provided - no response. Facebook doesn't have a direct phone line (can you believe it?), but I've emailed them and I'm anticipating a reply. 

What can I do guys? I'm completely at a loss, and sitting on the sidelines watching this competitor's post explode in popularity.",7,8,2017-08-05,ECOM,0.12511634826660156,0.8534878492355347,0.021395813673734665
woocommerce,Best Cache Plugin for WooCommerce?,"I recently installed a Cache Plugin on my Woocommerce site (WP Super Cache) but ran into the usual problems you encounter when using such plugins without properly configuring them for WooCommerce. It started affecting my cart in particular and I noticed when I navigated to the main homepage or would go into the main shop page of my site, the items would re-appear or disappear. 

I did a general search and saw a few people recommend Comet Cache instead for Woocommerce. It worked awesome at first but I started to notice the same pattern again. Just in case someone tells me I'm not configuring these plugins correctly, just know that I have looked into that and added URL Exclusions for the cart and checkout of my site, but it still shows up with no items on the homepage when I test it in other browsers (and in other platforms). I'm testing my site on both Mac and PC for consistency. Does anyone have any recommendations? I've tried W3 Total Cache and it breaks my layout. Maybe I'm just dumb but it seemed to not work as well.

dropship,Please give me an honest critique of my dropshipping website,"Hi everyone. So I am planning to launch a dropshipping store within the next few weeks or so (website is not officially live yet as I've set a password on it) and would like honest feedback/critique of what improvements I can make. The products I am selling are unicorn-themed products from tee shirts to various accessories such as bracelets and necklaces to socks. I want to target unicorn lovers and enthusiasts.

The downside of my store is that I am offering U.S. only shipping. I am using a large number of different suppliers and I've checked that MOST do not offer e-packet shipping to other countries outside the U.S..when they do, it says it takes over 30 days! Who would be willing to wait that long for a freaking bracelet, necklace, or tee shirt? I always try to think from the customer's perspective. Therefore, I decided to give up on offering international shipping and have decided to do U.S. only shipping. 

The website is: www.theuniqornclub.com
Password: Friday92

(Please keep in mind that I am not finished with setting up the prices, changing the product titles, adding descriptions, removing some watermarks from the images etc.) I am fully aware of their importance so I don't necessarily really need feedback that pertains to that...also, not all products I am trying to sell have been pushed into the shop yet..but I am almost getting there.

shopify,"Can I create a Shopify app using only Node and React, or do I need Ruby/Rails as well?","I'm wanting to create a Shopify app where users can create custom products. This will be a user interface that plugs into an existing Shopify store via an iframe.

I see the following resources:

* The Getting Started Ruby app: https://github.com/Shopify/example-ruby-app. This uses Sinatra to provide a very simple API I can host which enables a store to install the app, authenticate, and an order creation webhook.
* The shopify_app Rails engine: http://shopify.github.io/shopify_app. I understand this provides an entire framework for creating a Shopify app using Ruby/Rails.
* Polaris: https://polaris.shopify.com/. I understand this is a component library like Material UI or Bootstrap.

I then see several Node.js modules for interacting with Shopify's API:

* https://github.com/MONEI/Shopify-api-node
* https://github.com/ctalkington/node-shopify-api
* https://github.com/christophergregory/shopify-node-api
* https://github.com/jonpulice/node-shopify-auth

I am a Node.js and React developer and not a Ruby/Rails developer, so I would much prefer to use Node.js and React and bypass using Ruby or Rails; is this realistic? I'm trying to understand the overall architecture. If I want to go the Node.js + React route, what will be the architectural components in play? It seems like I'll have the following:

1. A Node.js Express API that I'll host. This will enable store owners to install my Shopify app and authenticate, and it will enable my application to establish endpoints for Shopify webhooks.

2. Polaris for UI components (purely for the purpose of ensuring that the look and feel is standard).

3. A React-driven UI. This will be what is pulled into a store owner's Shopify site via an iframe. It will provide the UI for creating and managing custom products (which is the overall goal of my product).

I was recently asked to open up an ecommerce business. I would be the sole person making sure the listings go up. The catalog appears to be in the range of about 400-500 items. My time line is 4-5 months, working solo. 

What strategy should I use to cheaply and quickly get the items on board? 

I'm split between BigCommerce and Shopify. I don't know which service is better for this?

There's a few options which I know about, or have come across on reddit:
Channel Advisor(&gt;$1000/mo), Solid Commerce ($500/mo), Seller Cloud ($500/mo), Sellbrite ($250/mo), Skubana, SellerActive (&gt;$300/mo).

Then the affordable alternatives

Listing Mirror: Amazon -&gt; eBay, Amazon -&gt; WalMart $70/month

Inkfrog: Shopify -&gt; eBay $30/month

Bytestand: Amazon -&gt; Shopify

Shopfiy: eBay -&gt; Shopify (Haven't used the Amazon features yet, I don't think they can list on there)

eComDash: ? $50/month

I'm familiar with bulk listing on Amazon to create listings. My understanding is that Amazon is the most tricky to make listings on, so we had one person with the sole task of that. Then, that person would take the share the content of the listings to a second person who fed it channel advisor (CA). CA would then load the listings on all the other channels.

In another business I worked at, they used solid commerce straight up. They made the listings there, which then fed to all the other channels.",4,4,2017-08-09,ECOM,0.041772495955228806,0.93403160572052,0.024195902049541473

shopify,How to customize shopify URL?,"Hi, thanks for reading.

To start, I do want to say this is possible because I see other shopify websites who already do what I want to do.  (just wanted to say this because i see tons of threads saying it can't be done)

I want to create ""www.example.com/giveaways"" but at the moment it is ""www.example.com/pages/giveaways""

I see other websites who have figured out how to take out the ""pages"" or ""collections"" etc.

What it does when you click on the url without the path like pages or collections, it will redirect to the ""pages"" or ""collections""

For example you type in ""www.example.com/doober"" it will redirect to www.examples.com/collections/doober""

dropship,A quick update on my journey and some of the new things I've learned:,"Hello, fellow dropshippers!

Just wanted to drop by and give you an update on my journey while sharing some of the things I've learned since my last update.

For those of you who don't know who I am, I'm this guy: https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/6nbj4y/started_my_store_this_month_made_44760_yesterday

So, first, a quick update: I actually hit my goal (of $1k/day) on the 2nd to last day of July. I was cutting it close, but I made it brahs. And now that I've finally hit that goal, my next goal will be to hit $10k/day by the end of September. I really do think it's possible because I have a super secret awesome-sauce product I'll be testing over the next few weeks... and if it works well, I may share it with you guys (well, not the actual product but I'll show you guys how to replicate it).

Anyway, that's it for the update on my journey... now here are some things I wanted to share with you guys:

* **Instagram has been converting WAY better than Facebook for me.** Not only that, I also get a much higher average order value from people who come from IG. Why is that? Maybe it's because IG is becoming more prevalent? I dunno. But what I do know is that IG is routinely giving me better numbers and a higher ROI. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean IG will work amazing well for you. That's why you need to test, test, test! Also, you really do need high quality pics for your IG ads to convert. So if you have chitty pics, then scour AliExpress and look for a listing of your product that has high quality pictures. 

* **Chargebacks are a bitch.** So I've had over 1,000 orders in July and I've only had 3 refunds and 1 chargeback. However, chargebacks are a real bitch. I'm happy I've only gotten 1 so far but when you do get a chargeback, Shopify actually charges you an extra $15 on top of the money you have to refund. So what can you do about this? Not much. All you can really do is start up a chargeback fund (basically, save some money on the side in case you get a buncha chargebacks). And then hope to God you don't get any asshole customers.

* **Free + Shipping isn't worth it in the long run.** I know, I know. In my original post I told you guys that I do the Free + Shipping offer... but... I just don't think it's worth it anymore. The margins are way too thin and although it's a great way to generate a sizable customer list (aka LEADS), I'd rather focus on profitability. Plus, it has the potential to really damage your branding and credibility. Do I recommend you guys never use the Free + Shipping model? No. You can definitely try it out and I actually do recommend it if you're hesitant or want some validation/proof that this whole dropshipping thing can actually generate sales. Then, once you become 'confident', drop the Free + Shipping shit and focus on actual retail priced items.

* **Some days are going to be absolute SHIT.** Some days you'll do amazing well... and some days you'll do absolutely horrible. Why does this happen? It's because you're selling to humans. There'll come a point where you generate so many sales that you start looking at each order, purchase, or customer as a number. Don't do that. Remember that each and every person that buys from you is a living, breathing human being. So that means there are some days where people will buy, and some days where they won't. There's also other things that can factor into this like weather, paychecks, days of the week (weekends suck for me), holidays, vacations, etc. So if you're having a bad day, don't freak out. Just wait it out and see how it goes the next day. If you're doing consistently bad for over a week, then kill your ads and start over.

* **Customers are assholes sometimes.** But it's totally understandable (you've probably been an asshole customer once in your life). There'll be a lot of times where you get people calling you a scam on Facebook or just being complete assholes. What should you do in this situation? Be professional and polite. Always. If you wake up on the wrong side of the bed and think you're gonna go off on a customer, then take a step back and take a deep breath, and remember, it's your DUTY to serve these people -- no matter how shitty they may be to you. Literally every time someone has gotten mad at me for the shipping being too slow or because of some inane thing like not being able to find their tracking number, I've always been professional and polite. And guess what? It pays off. The customer ends up being SUPER FUCKING HAPPY. Why? Because these people (by nature) are passionate and emotional. So by keeping YOUR cool and helping out in every way possible, you'll help flip the switch take them from being angry to absolutely happy and satisfied with your customer service.

* **Scaling is a matter of trial and error.** Scaling is a bitch. I've tried many methods and have failed when using most of them. But I finally found a scaling method that works for me. How? By testing. So just remember, test the shit out of everything you do. If you have a successful product + ad combo, then test new audiences/interest. Test new placements. Test different budgets using manual bid. Test different age groups. Test genders. Just keep testing until you find the most profitable method. 

* **Successful products + ads don't last forever.** However, you can PROBABLY revitalize them by cycling the ads, using a new creative, trying out new audiences, or testing different placements. But... you should also always be testing a new product at all times. So if your bread &amp; butter product starts to die down, you can start focusing on your other successful ones.

That's about all the stuff I wanted to share (for now).

If you have any questions, please ask them below. 

Also, if possible, I'd like to hear some of the updates from the people who PM'd me asking for advice. How much have you guys progressed since we last talked?

ecommerce,Help Understanding Selling Products on Shopify!!!?,"Hello friends,
Everyone keeps telling me to not sell (brand name goods) on Shopify when importing from Aliexpress. I'm a little confused, isn't everything on Aliexpress that is being listed as wholesale a brand, like when I look at the product, everything I see has a brand name? Do you guys mean like Big Name Brands like; Apple, Sony, Coach? 

I am wanting to sell Leather Jackets, Bags, Accessories. All of these products have a brand name that I can find. I want to have my own website (brand) where I sell hundreds of wholesale leather goods. Obviously I am not manufacturing these items just re-selling.

How should I display these items, do I clearly put forth the brand name? How do I go about this.

shopify,"Looking for a developer to build a Shopify app - need assistance, recommendations, etc.","Hello,

Long story short, I'm a dev team manager with a good amount of experience managing web projects (both front and back-end). The company I'm with recently received a Shopify development project; however, we have recently determined that we need a very basic Shopify app. The problem is that our current team makeup does not have any developers with Shopify app development experience.

I've got a client that needs a 3rd-party inventory API integrated to feed into Shopify's API - again, preferably as an app. This will be used to sync and update inventory, pricing, etc. on an interval basis. That's really it - there's not any other major requirements for the project, just API to API, with the output being Shopify integrated through WordPress.

I have done a lot of front-end work with Shopify, but it is not something I typically encounter on our projects. It's also a one-off, and not something we will likely encounter again, so I'm looking for a good source for Shopify developers.

Any recommendations on the best place to look? I've never sourced a Shopify-specific developer before, and the project size is relatively small-to-medium at best, so I don't want to go down the road of posting official job openings or posting a temporary position, as it should be relatively straightforward.

2. Also, inventory is replenished after a set period of time for each product. In this case would be 1-4 weeks.

I am completely new to sourcing products from China.
I have found a product, that I would like to sell on Amazon (Europe). I am already in touch with a few producers, talking about customization and other details.
Now I am struggling a bit finding a shipping solution, as I have no idea how to start. I read the guide posted on reddit, therefore  I know that there are freight forwarders, consolidators and companies such as DHL/UPS etc.
I think consolidators are the suitable solution for my requirements. 
Is there any possibility to compare rates? 
Do you have any recommendations, which consolidator to choose?

My first order will contain around 300 items with 6 vtersions for A/B testing. THe weight is 90kg (~200lbs).

ecommerce,Is my Ecomm idea viable? Need advice,"My idea is selling hats online. ""Dad Hats"" specifically. You know, the trendy 6 panel hats? Google it if you need too.
Anyways, I'm 23 years old and wear these things all the time and so do a lot of people I know. It's a pretty popular style in hip hop and just in general. For all ages!

If you type dad hat in amazon, you'll see a bunch of basic designs. Mostly just an emoji embroidered on it or a little symbol like a beer mug, or the word ""Lit"" etc... a lot of basic stuff which is pretty cool at the same time.

My idea is stepping the game up. I've designed a few that are just as trendy but more creative. I think they will stand out compared to the super basic ones you mostly find. 

I plan to design a website for them and advertise it though Instagram and Facebook ads. I also want to put them on amazon, eBay, Shopify, and sell them through my local Facebook marketplace.

My only concern is of how saturated the hat market is and if I will be noticed. It's hard to get into any market these days but I'm sure it's still possible to make a profit. Im a true consumer of these products and have bought hats from random no none sites I came off based because the hat was dope. So you think if I had original ideas but still trendy and did the same thing it could be profitable?

A simple Google search widget could potentially work, but thought there may be a more eloquent solution out there given this doesn't seem like it's a terrifically unique request.  

If this can't happen I'd be satisfied with being able to execute a search from the Shopify site only, as using a Drupal module I can already propagate a page using Drupal Views which can show my products from the Shopify store (think automated ""Buy Button"").

dropship,How does anyone succeed in dropshipping when everyone buys from Amazon these days?,"So there’s tons of people including myself in the dropshipping game right now and what I’ve been thinking and asking myself is this: unless our niche products are somehow not found in websites like Amazon, why would anyone buy from our sites and wait 2-4 weeks?

I would assume everyone in the United States knows what Amazon is (come on it’s the largest internet based retailer in the world). People want their products in their hands fast within a few days. Amazon can simply not be defeated. Everyone I know including family friends and co-workers buy their stuff on Amazon (except for clothing &amp; food). Unless your product is extremely niche that can be barely found in Amazon, it’s hard to believe how any dropshipping store will highly succeed unless your product is: 1) Very Niche  2) Not being sold by Amazon  3) It’s a hot product with surprisingly very low competition on Amazon 4) Your using a fulfillment service (Assuming your using Aliexpress to find your suppliers from China).

I have a website where I drop ship all of my products through the use of different apps on Shopify. Now, we have been in business for 6 months and have been doing pretty well. We are now opening an Amazon store and have figured out a good way to drive traffic directly to our Amazon listings. Since launching the store, we have been selling 1-2 products a day on Amazon and it has been less than a week. My only concern is that my suppliers can take anywhere between 2-5 business days to produce something, and when creating the listings, they ask me how long production takes. Is it worth it to put the average of 3 days, since some will be made and shipped out before 3 days, or should I play it safe and put 4 or 5 days so I don't get in trouble with my metrics on Amazon. Would love some advice from anyone who has experience with this as to how I should approach this situation.

One problem I keep running into is having no benchmark for particular numbers or results - in particular, 'average monthly search' results tends to bug me for some reason. I may be missing something but if a niche keyword only gets 30 searches every month would this mean that it's a total writeoff? or does it still have potential?

shopify,Specific Question: Membership subscription and restricted products,"Hello and thank you in advance for reading my post.

I am working on a shopify store for a client who owns a shoe store and wants to start selling online. 

Here is the business model:
They sell clothes and shoes, but to buy the shoes you need to become a premium member for $15 a month (You can buy the clothes without a membership). These exclusive shoes will be released in limited quantities once a week, for deep discounted prices , hence the membership fee. 
I have installed the Bold Commerce recurring membership app and restricted the shoes to members only. Now here is my issue:
I need the shoe product thumbnails to show up on the front page, but once you click on the thumbnail it takes you to the membership sign up page and explains that it is a restricted product for members only. 

Here is my client's competitor, and who they are basing the membership model off of: https://www.solesteals.com/

They want their site to be similar to that, but have clickable product thumbnails that will take you to the membership registration page.

Does anybody have experience with Bold Commerce recurring membership app and know how to do this?

dropship,"Tons of engagement on FB, but very few conversions and 0 sales","I recently opened a store in the dog niche.

I ran a few ads and got quite a few engagements on the facebook page, but very low conversion rates and no sales. The CTR on ads was 0.10-0.20%. For instance, I could get ~130 likes on the post and only 5 visits on the website.

ecommerce,Competing with Amazon on selling generic/commodity products. Is there always room in the market for a job well done?,"Let's say your e-commerce store sells other manufacturers' existing products. You're buying wholesale and then retailing (i.e., you are NOT creating your own product). 

The usual advice for competing with Amazon goes like this:

* Create a brand with a unique story
* Laser focus on a niche and become the expert
* Nail customer service
* Create great content 
* Reach the customer first
* Offer better technical support/service
* Etc. 

It all basically centers on building great customer relationships, and the idea is, there is always room for a job well done. 

I don't feel so confident about that. 

I know for me personally, I'll almost **always** make the final purchase on Amazon when possible, no matter how hard smaller competitors might try to create a good experience for me. Amazon usually has the best price, fastest shipping, I don't have to create a new account on another website, I can use the mobile app and get the 5% store card discount....Etc. And I think most people are also like this (despite what they might claim).

*I almost never buy outside of Amazon unless it's for one reason only: **Amazon doesn't have the product I want.***

I think to truly compete with Amazon, you either need your 1) own product or 2) some radically different business model (bad example, but think subscription box). 

I think that if you're selling products that Amazon also has, you are fighting a losing battle no matter how hard you try. No matter how much great content you make, no matter how much you bend backwards and get people to trust you, Amazon will still kill you with the fundamentals. Low price and fast shipping. Sure, you might get a handful of customers, but I dont think it'll scale. 

What do you all think? Am I being realistic or just pessimistic? Can anyone change my view?",9,7,2017-08-19,ECOM,0.021361112594604492,0.919928789138794,0.05871012061834335

Is there a cheaper alternative such as glue or some kind of adhesive that is just as effective and quick?

shopify,5 Secrets to Find Reliable Suppliers for Your Dropshipping Business,"So you’ve decided to start an online business, and start reading up on everything there is to know about ecommerce. You look up all the best practices and strategies, and you decide that drop shipping is right down your alley. Not only will you avoid sinking lot of money into a physical inventory, you won’t even have to handle fulfillment, letting you focus on marketing and business development. Everything’s starting to look up!

Until, that is, you realize you still need a supplier to partner with to make your store a reality. All e-tailers that rely on drop shipping or third party fulfillment run into this problem at some point. In fact, one of the most common questions we get at HubLogix goes something like this:

How can I find a real supplier that drop ships my product reliably?

DROP SHIPPING AND FULFILLMENT AND MANUFACTURERS

Finding a good supplier can be a very time-consuming task, and rightly so. For most of our customers, having suppliers that they can count on is one of the cornerstones of their online business. If you drop ship or use third party fulfillment, you can’t partner with an inconsistent or unreliable vendor and expect to stay in business for very long, and our customers intuitively realize this.

Since HubLogix happens to be in the business of boosting your business, we thought that we’d go all-out and gather up all our experience and knowledge about this very important issue and compile it into an easy-to-follow, friendly guide. We hope it will help you find a supplier that works for you.

GET YOUR SHIP TOGETHER

Before you can begin searching for your dream supplier, you’ll need to make sure you have a few things taken care of. Wholesalers often need proof that you’re an actual retailer and not just a consumer before they even consider partnering with you.

Address this issue before it occurs and make sure you have your business’ EIN number on hand already, as well as a copy of your resale certificate.

Also, be familiar with basic drop shipping terminology and common practices before you call. Take a look at the general advice section and helpful links at the bottom of this guide for a basic overview of these, and advice on how to avoid illegitimate suppliers.

1) KNOW YOUR INDUSTRY

Different industries can have different supply chains. Understanding where you fit into this picture can help you find suppliers that will cater to your needs.

For example, if you’re going to be running a small boutique store that sells a very specialized kind of item, you’re not going to run into much success if you look for large distributors – you’ll probably need to partner with a manufacturer or local supplier directly. If you’re going to be running a large electronics accessories store, it’ll make a lot more sense to partner with a bigger distributor with a wide selection of products to sell.

2) TRY MANUFACTURERS FIRST

Try to figure out who manufactures the items you want to sell on your store and contact them directly to ask them if they can drop ship their items. You can email them, but I recommend just calling them over the phone. You’ll get more information quicker and hopefully now have a contact within the manufacturer itself, which is especially useful if you’re filling a new or smaller niche.

As you contact vendors, you’ll find they fall into one of three categories. Here’s what each one means for you:

They drop ship – That’s great news, because you just found a perfect vendor! Make sure to ask about what they require from their partners, and their minimum order requirements.
They don’t drop ship – Unfortunate, but not the end of the world. It just means a little more searching. Ask them about what distributors they supply their products to and take note of them.
They don’t offer their products for resale – Oh well, at least you know now. Time to try someone else.
Even e-tailers with large inventories and a variety of products should directly contact the manufacturers of the items they want to sell. There are a couple of reasons why this is always the smartest initial move – they’ll usually have the best prices if they do drop ship, and if they don’t, they’ll at least have leads on more distributors. These distributors will usually be reputable, and carry a selection of similar products from different manufacturers you can then add to your inventory.

3) BE OLD-FASHIONED

It’s almost common knowledge that most suppliers don’t prioritize SEO. To add to this, many of their sites look like they’ve time-traveled straight from the 90’s. This means that although a little targeted Google-fu  might still net you results, being old-fashioned can be a more effective use of your time.

Trade magazines or newsletters for your particular industry can be an invaluable resource, as they’re usually filled with ads from suppliers specifically looking for people like you. Most of these publications have websites with past issues and even more resources, and you may be able to find print versions at your local library.

Drop shipping or industry forums and online groups can be another useful resource, if their members are willing to share the suppliers they use.

Finally, look into attending a trade show or conference relevant to your niche, where you can directly interact with reps from potential suppliers. You can use a site like TSNN.com to find relevant conferences near you.

4) DIVE INTO THE DEPTHS (OF GOOOOOOOOOGLE)

Finding actual, reliable suppliers on the internet can be a frustrating, time-consuming process. For every actual wholesaler you find, you might find two that no longer exist, three that are scams, and four that have terrible terms.

Fortunately, there are a few simple techniques you can use to increase your chances of success when looking for vendors online.

First of all, as we mentioned before, many decent suppliers have awful online presences. You’re going to have to delve deep into your search results to find them – think page 10 and onwards.  Search for as many different identifiers as you can to make sure you’ve covered all your bases.

When you’re searching for products, here’s are a few terms you’ll want to try searching with: “wholesale”, “dropship”, “manufacturer”, “supplier”, “distributor”, “reseller”, “ecommerce”, and “fulfillment”. Also consider searching for specific terms like “wholesale only,” “retailer wanted,” or “become a reseller.”

Another way to tailor your searches is by location – add in a physical location to find vendors near your customers or use the Google site search feature to search for ones based in a specific country (for example, to find sites in China, add “site:.cn” to your search).

Don’t necessarily rule out a vendor because it has a dated webpage – remember that many suppliers don’t bother creating a top-of-the-line online experience. Instead, focus on their contact page and make sure the information is up to date and accurate. Make sure to actually get in touch with them if you are considering partnering with them, and look to see if there are any reviews or testimonials that mention them online.

This may seem like a bit much, as it can be easy to find a seemingly large vendor with a slick, well-maintained site on the first page of your results, but it’s often worth it to dig deeper to find suppliers with better prices and terms than those you find at first glance. You’ll also have less competition at your price point, as it’s likely many of your competitors will have quickly chosen the large site instead of taking the time to find alternatives.

5) TRY WHAT’S LEFT

By now, you should have compiled at least a modest list of potential suppliers for your store. If not, or if you want even more options, here are a few additional resources you can try to take advantage of:

There are a couple of curated lists online that you can pay to access. Some of these have outdated and obsolete entries, however, so be careful and make sure you research the list to make sure it’s useful and recent.

Finally, to find suppliers from all over the world (especially China), you can use a site like Alibaba to compile a list of drop shippers for particular products. This works for a lot of people, but there are potential downsides – the products can be of questionable quality and any issues with products or shipping will be your fault in your customers’ minds. Make sure you always start out small and don’t risk too much – do not make your first order for 1000 items and wire transfer your payment. Let them earn your trust, as some suppliers in China are notorious for taking money and never sending items. If they accept PayPal or another form of secure payment, always opt for that. Keep these factors in mind when dealing with international drop shippers, and always test them thoroughly.

WRAPPING IT UP AND SHIPPING IT OUT

By now you should have a solid list of potential suppliers, or at least a good grip on how to begin looking for them. Drop shipping is an exciting and fast-growing industry, and even large and established retailers are implementing drop shipping into their ecommerce arsenals.

All that’s left is to get out there and get started!

shopify,"Struggling to pick the right software for my eCommerce multi-channel launch (Shopify, Amazon FBA, Amazon FBM)","{I have edited this post to make it less ranty, and more constructive/clear}

I would love to hear stories of your small business, e-Commerce work flows.  Especially for a multi-channel launch.  I am struggling to visualize how my back-office &amp; accounting should optimally work, given a mish mash of various plugins I intend to use.  My web developer is more of an implementation person vs. a designer, and that leaves me on my own to figure out workflows.  I sincerely appreciate any help in advance! 

About my business:
- I will be selling a ~$20 price point set of items at hopefully 2,500-5,000 units per month across 10 SKUs and ~6 months inventory
- I will be working with two sets of inventory, (i) set held at Amazon warehouses fulfilled via Amazon FBA, and (ii) another set held at a 3PL fulfillment service that will fulfill orders through my Shopify website and additional channels I can push Shopify Inventory to (e.g., additional SKU on Amazon FBM, Jet.com etc.)

Regarding sales through channel (ii), it is imperative that Shopify is the central, standardizing channel for receiving and processing orders.  Anyone ordering product from non-FBA orders will also receive a digital PDF unique to their physical product sold (Said another way, when an order comes into Shopify (e.g., a Amazon FBM order), I will want to email that customer a PDF as part of their order fulfillment).

Thus I need to:
* Push my listings from Shopify to Amazon FBM, eBay, Jet.Com etc.
* Manage my inventory across the 2 warehouses (3PL &amp; Amazon FBA)
* Manage the accounting across the 2 warehouse/order flows 
* Manage returns through one or two systems, depending on how I can set everything up
* Avoid duplication generally, and gain centralization where I can do it

What I am thinking of doing:
* Running two separate businesses:  Amazon FBA and my Shopify channels (which would include Amazon FBM)
* Amazon FBA would be run separately with separate accounting plugins, inventory management, etc.
* Shopify business will be run with:
  -  ShoppingFeed to push orders from my Shopify website to Amazon (FBM) eBay - and eventually Jet.com and WalMart if/when they add it.  
  -  TBD inventory.  Paying $200-500/month for inventory management software feels like overkill for 10 SKUs with outsourced fulfillment (i.e I don't need to print labels) and 2 suppliers (I don't need automatic POs).  I may just do that in Excel.  But this isn't scaleable/automatic/centralized. 
  - TBD accounting.  I imagine I need to figure out other providers before picking accounting.  I see that some that some users of Xero need to find additional plugins to pull in sales price vs. shipping costs etc. that are actually useful for calculating COGS etc... and you probably need different plugins for Amazon. Maybe its better to hire someone off elance? 

So I am a bit overwhelmed.  Using so many plugins, at such a high cost per month, adds complexity &amp; cost.  And I cannot visualize what I should be trying to do.  And I want to set it up right in advance!

The tasks I have identified are:
- Using an app that can push listings/manage orders/manage returns from Shopify for external sites like Amazon FBM, Jet.com etc.
- Help me monitor inventory in Amazon FBA and my 3PL warehouse (I don't need shopping labels etc. as the 3PL and Amazon will handle that)
- Magically sync all data on orders, shipping costs, taxes, etc. with Xero or QuickBooks so I can have a semblance of books &amp; records, and GAAP accounting.

ecommerce,Tips for getting ready for Black Friday,"**Getting ready for Blackfriday**

It is only 3 months until Black Friday in the US, which means it is time to start preparing for a lot of merchants. As the countdown to the biggest grossing holiday sale begins we have compiled a list of tips to help start your holiday shopping season with a bang. Let’s make this year your best Black Friday ever!

 

**Announce your sales**

Letting your shoppers know ahead of time about your sales is crucial. Most shoppers expect that there will be sales and love to know what is on sale and where it is on sale. Lots of shoppers plan their buying strategies around these sales. Using banners on your site and your mailing list is a great way to let customer know what is going to be on sale and when. Don’t be afraid to start earlier than normal. Especially if you are writing articles about your Black Friday sale. The articles take some time to get indexed and become searchable, so the earlier the better. We generally recommend 45 days for articles to become fully searchable and indexed.

**Mailing list**

Use your mailing list. Overuse your mailing list. Studies have shown that most buyers respond to mailings on or around Black Friday. Lots of customer are actually wanting to get mails this time of year to see what is on sale. If you target your emails at the most effective times, you can increase your sales exponentially.  Some of the best times to set the emails to be delivered are around meal time on Thursday. People are stuck at functions usually and not out shopping. This is a great time to target people who are always on their devices. They can make an order without anyone around them even knowing.

**Start early**

Typically Black Friday starts on the Friday after Thanksgiving. But in the last several years retailers have been pushing it forward more and more. This makes it hard to compete as an online retailer when everyone is out shopping at brick and mortar locations while your sale is going on. Consider starting your sale early Thursday or even Wednesday night to get a jump on other retailers. As an online retailer the best time to start your sale is when physical stores are closed or inaccessible. Consumers are usually working or traveling Wednesday and Thursday morning, those are great times to start your sales. You have a captivated, bored audience expecting to spend money soon. Time to strike while the iron is hot.

**Start building up hype**

It’s never too early to give a sneak peak of your Black Friday plans to your customer base. It gives them something to look forward to, something to plan on. It also opens the door to them asking questions that could help you better target your sales. You might announce that one product is going to be on sale, but get feedback from your customers about another product they would like to see on sale.

**Post your sales to other sites**

Post your expect sale items to other site. There are lots of sites that cater to Black Friday sales, and get traffic from people looking especially for Black Friday deals. Don’t be afraid to seek these sites out and post your deals on these sites. It helps two fold, one from people searching the sites and another from the back links that the sites create to your site.

**Create holiday gift guides**

Create holiday gift guides on your site. Separate your products into groups and create a gift guide for each group. For instance you could create a gift guide for men, with different levels of gifts like under $20, under $50, under $100. Do the same for each different group. Writing compelling content about each product in the guide will give it the added boost as well. Don’t forget to use some of your best product images here as well.

**Use exit-intent offers**

Using exit intent offers might be a good way to reclaim sales of people considering leaving your site. You might could offer things like a free shipping coupon if they finish their purchase, or an upgraded product. These often times work, because you are recapturing people that are already trying to leave your site, you do not have much to lose trying to reel them back in.

**Have a countdown on your site**

Have a holiday countdown on your site. Either on the homepage or a dedicated sale page. Give your customers something to look forward to. Let them know when your sale is going to start and how long it will last. It will give them something to remember, they will know when exactly to come back and start saving.

**Show clear delivery dates**

One thing is for certain around the holidays, customers want to know when the products will arrive.  Having clear shipping costs and delivery dates could mean closing a sale or losing a sale. Prominently display the shipping costs and delivery timeframe on your site to maximize your chances of closing the sale, this is something that most larger retailers do.

**Use holiday graphics**

Holiday graphics get people in the holiday spirit. Part of being in the holiday spirit is spending money on gifts. This makes using holiday graphics on your site a no-brainer. Get your customers in the holiday-spend-money spirit with some simple, yet effective holiday graphics. Add a subtle touch, but do not go overboard.

**Don’t forget social**

Social media is one of the best ways to let people know about your sales. Start early and build a hype among your existing customers so they share the upcoming sales with their friends. This is a great way to win new customers as well. Be sure to format your graphics in the sizes that look best on each social media platform. Having a consistent, yet polished look will help you win sales from first time buyers.

**Use smart discounts**

Look at your product stock before you figure out what is on sale. The holidays are a great time to try to unload products that you are overstocked on or that are not moving as well as you would like them to. You can either deeply discount them, or you can offer them as add ons or upgrades to other products while at the same time increasing your average order value.

**Create a sense of urgency**

No one hates to miss a good deal. If customers see time running out on a purchase it will help them pull the trigger. Also, people are competitive in nature as well, if they see other customers buying all of one product it could help them buy it as well. There is a herd mentality with shoppers, they do not want to think someone is getting a better deal than they are. Use this against your customers, show almost out of stock signs, let them know that the offer will not be good tomorrow. Play against their sense of urgency.

**Upsell with bundles**

Upsell your offers with bundles. One good strategy is to create several bundles around price points. A majority of shoppers have a budget they will spend on a gift for someone. Usually it is in amounts like $20, $50, $100. Have bundles around those amounts. This cuts down on work for the buyer since they can buy everything at once, while at the same time it will increase your average order total. Because of costs associated with shipping, it is often cheaper to sell more products to one person than the same number of products to multiple people.

 

 

Remember, the holidays are a great time for winning new customers, but they are also a great time to spend with your family and loved ones as well. Have a great Black Friday and holiday season, and good luck with your sales.",1,5,2017-08-25,ECOM,0.02724363561719656,0.921709418296814,0.05104696564376354

I'm just wondering who uses a sales funnel for their e-commerce site.

woocommerce,PayPal IPNs and OpenSSL versions,"I have old, cheap hosting. I have a sub-1.0 version of OpenSSL, which is causing errors with wp_remote_post.

So, when orders are placed via PayPal, it won't automatically set the order to Processing once payment is made. I made it so that the orders wouldn't time out and auto-cancel, but I have to manually mark them as Processing.

Now, this would be fine with me, but I received an email from PayPal saying:

*""Please check your server that handles PayPal Instant Payment Notifications (IPN). IPNs sent to the following URL(s) are failing:*

*[URL redacted]*

*If you do not recognize this URL, you may be using a service provider that is using IPN on your behalf. Please contact your service provider with the above information. If this problem continues, IPNs may be disabled for your account.""*

I can't afford to lose PayPal permanently as a payment gateway, but my host won't be updating my server for 3-6 months. Their suggestions are just to upgrade to a non-grandfathered server (which I can't afford) or wait it out.

Is there another workaround for this? Or do I just have to stop accepting PayPal until my OpenSSL is updated?

Edit: After having read [this page](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/paypal-standard/#section-19), I've contacted my host about the use of fsockopen. However, all the way at the bottom it suggests:

*Alternatively, to disable duplicate invoice checking, log into your PayPal account and go to Profile &gt; Profile and Settings &gt; My Selling Preferences &gt; Block Payments (or) Payment Receiving Preferences and set Block accidental payments to “No.”*

ecommerce,The Gorilla StartUp: Why I started my first Business. Part 1,"Disclosure: I am a partner in Gorilla Socks

Who Inspires Me?

My grandmother left Naples in southern Italy at the end of World War II. Alone and with hardly any money, she travelled by train for three days and three nights, boarded the ferryboat from Calais to Dover and finally arrived in the United Kingdom. That’s how long it took to travel from Naples to London! The first couple of years she worked in the kitchen of a boarding school then in a cigarette factory. She left London for Manchester, one of the industrial capitals of the time. It was then, that for the first time my grandmother embarked on an entrepreneurial journey. She opened a little corner shop which was very successful. Her life changed. She was independent, running her own business and building wealth faster than she could have ever imagined. She had left behind her family and gone to another country at a time when leaving home wasn’t so easy. What’s more, she did not speak English. Every time I think I have it hard, I try to remember what my grandmother went through. Turns out I am having it easy after all!

Why I Started a Business?

Not everyone is born to be an entrepreneur and not everyone should be. Some like the stability of a job. There is nothing wrong with that. What makes one happy is what matters. During my first ten working years, I always had the urge to start some sort of business. However, I kept my day job and ignored the little inner voices. Last year, my university flat mate was in town. He admitted that he too had been thinking of starting something. He felt the same itch. After discussing a few ideas, we agreed it was time to get our acts together and start our first business. This is when we established Gorilla Socks.

What do you feel before starting a Business?

You have two voices in your head. The positive one who keeps telling you that everything will be ok and that success is just round the corner. Then there is the darker voice: the negative one. It speaks of fear, insecurity, “what will people say?” As a novice entrepreneur you are juggling with these two states of mind. One day your positive side will speak loudest. As a novice entrepreneur myself, I believe that this imbalance will always be present. When you feel good, just try to accomplish as much as possible. When you have a bad day, just got for a walk. Tony Robins has an interesting theory for productivity and ultimate success. It is summarised in this formula: State-Story-Strategy. Before brainstorming, make sure your state of mind is positive, then tell yourself a positive story. Solutions to your problems will follow.

What’s positive about starting a Business?

For one you will answer those “what if” questions. Businesses do fail, and maybe my business will fail too, but my biggest fear in life is regret at not having tried. Starting a business can be your personal MBA. Your learning curve is exponential. You will build new skills because you are involved in every single aspect of the company: marketing, sales, accounting, operations etc. You will be building a network which will be useful in the years to come as your business grows. From a practical viewpoint, a business can help you save costs through tax deductions (I will discuss this in more details in later posts). Starting a business will take you closer to financial independence.

What do you have to expect once you start a Business?

Jack Ma summarises it very nicely “When doing Sales, the first people who will trust you will be Strangers, Friends will be shielding against you, fair-weather friends will distance from you. Family will look down upon you”. The sentence is a bit extreme, we did get some sales from friends and family when we started. However, our first sale was to a stranger. Keep this quote in mind, it will help you put things in perspective.

Conclusion

In the next couple of posts I will describe how we started Gorilla Socks. I will answer all the questions we dealt with when we began. Most of what we achieved was through trial and error, which I believe is the most efficient way to get things right.

Starting a business is hard mentally and physically. You have to deal with anxiety, doubts and setbacks. Some people will disappoint you and you will have times when you think that it was all a waste of time. However, success hardly ever comes in the short term. Starting a business from the ground takes time and dedication. You will have hard days but you will have great days too. Remember your successes when you are demoralised, stay positive!",5,6,2017-08-28,ECOM,0.038797639310359955,0.9232009053230286,0.03800146281719208

ecommerce,Points to keep in mind before starting a Business! Part 2,"Disclosure: I am a partner in Gorilla Socks

Why you should keep your day job

Before embarking on my first entrepreneurial journey, I read a lot on this topic. I had read articles and books by entrepreneurs, journalists and “experts” (if you are not an entrepreneur how can you be an expert?). What is an entrepreneur? A great deal of nonsense has been written on this subject. Some pundits believe that to be an entrepreneur you have to drop what you are doing and focus exclusively on your business. According to these “experts”, keeping your day job whilst starting a business, will not categorise you as an entrepreneur. Pure gibberish!

Entrepreneurship is a state of mind

You don’t have to own a multi-billion dollar business to be an entrepreneur (hopefully, you will have, one day). Being an entrepreneur is a state of mind. You create value for yourself and others by constantly pushing yourself outside your comfort zone. You are like a mad scientist looking for the right formula. You apply your discoveries, sometimes you fail, sometimes the formula is perfect.

Keep your day job!

There are two scenarios in which you should leave your day job to focus exclusively on your start up:

If you are a rich kid and are supported by your family.
If an investor has pledged seed money for your start up and is paying your rent! Cash flow is king. You have running costs to live. Unless you own a house you will have to pay rent, if you own a house there will be costs associated with it such as property tax.
Running out of cash is damaging for three reasons:

The obvious one: you will end up under a bridge if you can’t support yourself.
Running low on cash is mentally straining and will affect your productivity.
Unless you have an investor, you will have to fund your business and unless you have a magic wand, money will have to come out of your pocket. Bottom line, be excited about your start up but keep your brain switched on too!
Start-up Costs

One of our first mistakes when we started Gorilla Socks, was probably underestimating our initial and running costs (will talk about this specifically later). Try to plan this as meticulously as possible. It is hard when you have no experience, but try to be as lean as possible from day one. Avoid unnecessary costs until you have the blessing of your customers (will walk you through this later, don’t worry)!

Frame of mind

Be excited about your new project, you have to be! If you are not positive how can customers buy your product? Be cautious (not negative), the world is competitive, and your product will find resistance at first. Keep a balanced frame of mind and do not rush. It’s a marathon and you don’t want to burn out quickly.

Your Partners

Unless you are going solo, partner with someone you trust and complements your skills. Ideally, each partner will have a key skill to drive the business forward. From my perspective, I feel a partner or more helps tremendously, not only skills wise but also from a motivation perspective. A partner can motivate you on bad days (and you can do the same for him) as well as giving you feedback. When we have new projects at Gorilla Socks, we discuss ideas, filter the best ones and decide together how to implement them. Two brains are better than one. Also when you have a partner, all of a sudden your network grows. You now have access to all of his contacts!

Conclusion

I started my business while still having a day job. Keeping a positive cash flow is vital. You have to be able to pay your bills for peace of mind and survival. Gorilla Socks was our first business, and we made some initial mistakes (and will continue to do so). Don’t feel down when it happens. On the contrary, treasure them, mistakes are a great learning curve. Ask people who have done it already. Don’t be afraid! Learn from their experiences, it’s invaluable! As you start, people will reject you. It is normal, do not take it personally. People are busy. It’s life!

If you really feel that starting a business is right for you, do so. Just make sure you keep a balanced mentality. Good things do happen. It just takes time and perseverance.",3,4,2017-08-29,ECOM,0.04466026648879051,0.9230958819389343,0.032243840396404266
shopify,Building an app for checkout page donations,"Hi r/shopify

I am starting a non-profit developing an app you can add to the bottom of your e-commerce checkout page that allows customers to choose a cause and seamlessly donate money to charity. It’s like the $1 donations you see in grocery stores, but applied to e-commerce.

Please follow this link for our infograph + designs of what the app will look like on your store: https://goo.gl/photos/8WDhUbdsYpDvmTio6

This low cost solution will give customers an easy way to donate to a cause they love, provide charities a free revenue stream, and store owners benefits such as reduced cart abandonment, increased sales, improved brand perception, and increased brand loyalty. 

The app will be available in September for download on the Shopify App Store for $9.99/month.

I would love to hear your opinions and if this is something you'd be interested in adding to your site!

Also any critiques and criticisms are greatly appreciated!!!

ecommerce,Please review my art portfolio website/art store!,"I am an artist who is learning (but struggling) with figuring out my online presence. I've created a website using Weebly (mainly because I liked the drag and drop system for building) but the blog I've created that's attached to it is through wordpress.com. 

I also have an Etsy shop and I post products on Society6 as well; so I created a ""shop"" tab on my website that features those Society6 products with direct links to their product pages, to try and direct more traffic there. 

I've been researching SEO and ecommerce and social media several hours a day for weeks now and I'm struggling a bit. I'm wondering if I made a mistake by using Weebly and should have instead used Wordpress.org or Shopify to create a better online presence. I'm also not reaching many people through Facebook or Instagram, either.

Despite updating all my SEO, my website traffic is pretty low (about 100 visitors a week) and all my Etsy shop sales have suddenly dropped off to absolutely nothing since switching my site over to this new one, which is so discouraging! Perhaps I should have a Shopify store and provide prints/items with my art on them via Printful, and also have my blog through Shopify as well? (Which is frustrating as I'm on Weebly's 2 year plan pre-paid, though I could, if needed, use that for my other blog).

Wondering if I can get some feedback here for what I might be doing wrong. Is it my SEO? My wesbsite? My artwork itself? What works and what needs to be changed?

I have no other job other than this one (due to chronic illness) so getting my own business up and running (and successful) is my only chance at making money and contributing.

ecommerce,I'm in between Magento and Prestashop. Any ideas?,"Hello,

I've done quite some research and can't decide what is best for a business. 

We are looking to create a new shop with some niche products. The whole experience of the shop would be based on recommendations of related products and past buys of the customer. However I can't decide what's best to get started.

The company just started so there is no eCommerce platform set up yet. I've played a bit with Magento and I find t really difficult to work with, slightly buggy and with only about 1000 extensions and 11 themes on the Magento Marketplace.

On the other hand, Prestashop has way more extensions and themes but I'm I've read it's not the best system to customize and work with. 

I know I haven't given you a lot of information but what should I look at when choosing the platform I will go for ?",26,3,2017-08-30,ECOM,0.017808400094509125,0.924731969833374,0.05745965242385864

woocommerce,"How to create a woocommerce store that can handle 300,000 variations?","So I'm working with a jeweller on my next project and he has roughly 4,000 products but the thing is that there are a lot of variations involved. Roughly 40 each in terms of size, metal and quality of metal.

I've only used WordPress in the past so I cannot make a jump to magneto for this. 

Would there be an issue since in the end it's just 4000 products with a lot of variations or will it behave like a store with 300,000 products?

ecommerce,Boss is relying his hopes and dreams on Walmart.com ...,"A few months ago I was put in charge of the ecommerce operations at a retail brand that's somewhat established in its industry.

We launched the ecommerce platform and are now growing at a reasonable pace. The CEO is an old fashioned guy that had been resisting online for way too long, (mostly due to the fact that conventional channels are still working for the company in Asian countries), so the launch of the ecommerce platform was kind of an exploratory endeavor, with only a conservative marketing budget. Still, most of our channels are showing good ROI.

Now that the ecommerce platforms are picking up steam, though, he's decided to invest heavily on this side, which would have been great, but for the fact that my boss, the marketing VP, is completely hung up on Walmart.com.

We have our product in some Walmart stores, and it seems the Walmart category manager my boss is in touch with has been encouraging him to invest a lot of marketing budget towards driving traffic to our products on Walmart.com (which hasn't even gone live yet) He's already decided to hire some marketing agency that specializes in driving traffic to Walmart.com, and throw most of our new marketing in their direction. He's constantly prattling on about walmart this and walmart that, sending everybody articles about how walmart is going to ... overtake Amazon ... talking about how sales are going to skyrocket once the walmart.com thing goes through.

I'd voice my skepticism about how walmart.com probably won't supercharge the sales numbers, but the company has a culture of pushing out any naysayers for being pessimistic, and my boss is someone that's been here forever and just pretty much gets his way, especially since the CEO is always in a different country. And besides that, the job pays well and fits in well with my schedule.

Overall it's astonishing to see just how out of touch some high-paid execs can be. I can only hope to convince my boss to be conservative in his campaign with Walmart.com so we can eventually start putting that money towards better channels.",17,6,2017-08-31,ECOM,0.032646384090185165,0.9248529672622681,0.04250059276819229
ecommerce,Planned on using a domain name; Set up social media profiles linking to it; domain gets bought?,"Sorry for the horrible title but I wasn't sure how to word it short but I was wondering if anyone knows of this being a common thing.

So I was planning on launching my online shop soon but wanted to get the social media ball started before I actually launch the shop itself. I knew which domain name I wanted to use which was available and in my cart at the time. While I was setting up my social media profiles I figured I would just throw the domain-to-be in while I'm already at it to save myself some time after I buy it. 

However, 2 days later the domain name was bought up and an unfilled out 'under construction' template page was thrown up.

 I was wondering if it's possible that a bot might have snagged it seeing that there was attention on a domain name that isn't yet owned (or something similar) or maybe I just have poor luck? 

**edit:** I just remembered to look up WHOIS and looks like my domain name was bought by a domain name wholesaler. So I guess it actually might have been taken by a bot due to me using the domain without it being owned by anyone...",11,5,2017-08-31,ECOM,0.02827570214867592,0.9310755729675293,0.04064870625734329

My website has over 500 products on at present. I am having trouble keeping an up to date accurate price on each product.

250 products we have in stock, 250 products we buy from different worldwide suppliers. All 500 products are spread over approximately 20 different brands. For the 250 products we buy worldwide, i need to find a simple way to automate costs without having to analyse and price each individual products monthly.

Here are the variables for price fluctuations;currency exchange rates, manufacturer price increases. 

At the moment, the majority of pricing on the website is out of date.

Are there any programs, Code, Extensions I can utilize to help with this?

woocommerce,Multi-level Product Variations excluding one another,"Hello,

I’m working on a gallery site which sells both digital/stock images and prints. Would it be possible to have one single product with several different variations, with one of them excluding the others like this:

* Choose either DIGITAL OR PRINT
* if DIGITAL, select file size (resolution), i.e. S, M, L, XL
* if PRINT, select
** MATERIAL
** PHYSICAL SIZE (i.e. 30×40, 60×45, etc.)

so that if you select DIGITAL, the rest of the PRINT options will not be visible at all.
