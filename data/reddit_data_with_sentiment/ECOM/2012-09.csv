ecommerce,Need some advice for software capable of custom price calculation,"Hey there, reddit:

One of my clients operates a business that is highly dependent on custom wood vents. We're currently looking for an e-commerce solution that will allow us to calculate a custom price based on three factors: the length of the vent, the height of the vent, and the species of wood being used. 

Here's the formula that we've got so far: ([length] * [width]) * [modifier], with the modifier being a decimal assigned to the individual species of wood. It would be nice if we could assign a minimum order price. We'd also like to integrate with ShipRush if possible.

dropship,Leaving eBay to focus on actual store-side. Wondering if anyone here wants to take over and become a dropshipper for my site?,"Hi everyone,

I am the owner of OyatsuCafe.com

I have been selling on eBay with decent success. However, I enjoy working on my site much more and eBay has become a stress I do not want. My products are cheaper than the larger shops out there, and I think that an experienced eBayer with an already built reputation can really do something here, so I want to present the opportunity to you.

My items are Japanese bento supplies and candy/drinks. These items are hard to find and sell very well. I can dropship with your name or company name on the package AND deal with everything in Japan (Suppliers, postage, etc).

I only want around 2-3 dropshippers to take me up on this. I would rather have a long-term business partnership with a few people than anything else. As I said, my site is really what I enjoy and I do not intend in the slightest to open up to dropshipping for everyone.

So please hit me up in the comments section or PM me with any questions.

* I don't want it to sell the products in bulk (like Branders)
* I want it to have clear shipping rates (sounds odd, but I can't use Vista Print, for example, simply because I don't have a access to a list of their shipping rates)
* It can't be too expensive (like PrintFection)

dropship,"Tried getting into drop shipping, scared by pushiness. Is it always like this?","The other day I started to sign up with a big name drop shipping service/network/directory (I'm not sure I can name it) just to get the free trial to learn more about drop shipping. I went through the first steps of the registration process (name, email, phone number) but then chickened out when I got to the step where I enter my credit card information so I closed down my browser tab.

It was a huge mistake to put my real phone number in because these guys called me not too long afterwards and asked if I had any questions about their service. I told them I was going to more research online about drop shipping but hadn't got to it yet, and at the end the guy said that he'd call me next week to see how I felt about it. I couldn't tell him not to (I am totally socially awkward penguin), and then next week I got a call twice from two different people asking if I needed more information about their offering. 

I hate talking to salesy people on the phone (me = socially awkward penguin) and am afraid to get into it again. 

DAE experience this or was this a one-off situation?

ecommerce,I need a Shipping Calculator for (US) Frieght &amp; LTL Shipments. Which cart should I use?,"I need to set up a website with shopping cart and ran into a snag. The items ship via freight. For example a 50lb bag of sand can be ordered, and 55 can fit on a skid, and people should be able to order 1 skid, 2 skids, 10 skids, etc. I’m not sure yet but there may be 2 or 3 possible warehouses the items will ship from. 

I really wanted to use BigCommerce but it is not looking good. 

I’m looking at FreightQuote for the integration and they’re recommending Ultracart. 

Magento is too expensive. 

I’m now wondering if people should do their own freight… I don’t want to get screwed with accepting a customer payment and having the shipping company jack up pricing on me because the cart didn’t calculate it correctly.. 

tl;dr I need a way to give freight quotes to people depending on quantity that integrates nicely with an existing shopping cart.",5,6,2012-09-18,ECOM,0.023793436586856842,0.9231283664703369,0.05307818204164505
