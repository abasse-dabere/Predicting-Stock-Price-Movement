ecommerce,"I am an artist with my paintings available for purchase on my site, however, I have not a sale on my site yet. Only in person. Advice?","Ok, so I am an artist, and I have been maintaining my site myself for quite a while now. I first built it in dreamweaver almost four years ago, and then found out about wordpress and have been using it ever since. For my cart plugin I am using cart66 lite, which is really easy to use and I am using Stripe as my payment gateway. I wish I could vouch for the combination but I haven't had any transactions beyond my own tests. I have tested it to see if it works and, yes of course it does take payments, so I know thats not the problem.  A couple months ago I put up a store on my website to sell my paintings, (when I found out I was going to be a dad funny enough) however none of my patrons have used my site to actually buy anything. However I have had people tell me they looked at the site and the available paintings first before making a decision on which painting to buy, and I even had a lady who printed the entire store page out and brought them along when coming to choose a painting to buy. I am scratching my head as to what I may be doing wrong, or what I am not doing that is preventing me from getting sales. I dont see that many artists running successful stores on their websites, but they are out there, and I hope to be one of them. Here is a link to my [site.](http://www.nigelrobertson.com) And suggestions or guidance will be greatly appreciated.

ecommerce,Need help finding the right shipping extension(s) for Magento.  I'm primarily going to be selling paintings...,"I'm working with a team to build a website that is powered by Magento that will be used to sell paintings from several different art galleries.  We're trying to find an extension that will allow us the ability to input dimensions and weight of the item and obtain accurate shipping cost estimates.  I have found one called [Dimensional Shipping](http://www.webshopapps.com/us/dimensional-shipping.html) that will do just that but I'm not certain it'll work.  The thing about selling paintings is that it costs a lot to package them and this extension doesn't offer the ability to include those estimates; it's strictly for shipping something by the dimensions it has after it's been packaged.

My thought about working around this was to use [another extension](http://www.webshopapps.com/us/shipping/per-product-handling.html) offered by the same company which allows you to enter individual handling fees for each product.  So you could punch in a handling fee that's about equal to or a little over what you expect the packaging fees would cost and then for shipping costs you'd assume the dimensions of the final package will be a couple inches over the actual dimensions of the item as well as a few additional pounds in weight to account for the weight of the box and padding.

A problem I'm wondering about with the second extension is if a person decided to select ""Free in-store pickup"" so there are no shipping or handling fees.  It doesn't appear possible to tell the second extension to not add a handling fee if the item isn't being shipped at all, so perhaps there's a better extension out there that could do all of the above for me?

I'm new to all of this and would really appreciate some advice about shipping extensions for Magento.  Thanks!",3.0,2,2013-01-26,ECOM,0.018304580822587013,0.9126767516136169,0.06901867687702179
