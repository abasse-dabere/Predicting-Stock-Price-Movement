ecommerce,Good alternative to OsCommerce suggestions?,"I made a website for my grandma's fabric shop a long while back in HTML in dreamweaver, the site has came a long way and looks 50% more better than it did. But the store page for online looks old fashioned and out dated. I feel bad for her that she's not getting any business on the online portion of her site because she is always asking me if there is an order. And i think she's not getting very much business on the store part because the old gross look of OS Commerce, i mean ive gone through and added some customization to it like changing the buttons and icons and colors and all but still. Also another reason i want to switch is because of installing plugins, its extremely annoying and ive went through the process of sitting there for like 5 days trying to install a mobile site through it and it still looks bad (the mobile site). I need something thats almost free and looks good, and maybe like OS Commmerce where you can install plugins for it. Something that might be nice aswell is a discount code plugin built in or something like that. Please let me know of any ecommerce things like this out there that you think would work. Thanks!

We’ve been selling stuff on Bonanza and eBay, and now we want to get our own site going. We are looking at the three hosting options – BigCommerce, Shopify and Volusion. 

It seems like most people recommend either BigCommerce or Shopify, but just looking at the pricing pages, Volusion actually seems like the best deal to me (comparing the beginner packages), at just 15 dollar per month with no transaction fees and a Facebook Store included (which nobody seems to mention in the reviews/comparisons).

I know they all have free trial periods, so I can just find out for myself, but I’m wondering if there is something I am missing. Am I overvaluing the Facebook Store? Is the Volusion UI really terrible?

I've been looking at getting into eCommerce for a number of months now to bolster my existing 9-5 income. I have done preliminary research into a number of niches which look promising, but I would like to do some more 'market validation' before doing a full launch.

One of the ideas I've seen mentioned before (well, once in Tim Ferris' Four Hour Work Week, end of Chapter 10, comment by Matt Schmidt) was to create a 'trial site', which is essentially a fully fledged eCommerce site, but the payment options have been disabled. In essence someone would be able to browse, add items to their cart, etc, but when it came time to check out, a sort of 'payment portal error' page would be displayed.

Reasoning behind this is to validate any assumptions made in the initial market research stages, and to see if the market really is as big as one thinks.

So my question is, has anyone done something similar to this on the dedicated eCommerce sites like Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, Vulsion, etc? Or has anyone attempted (or knows of) another way of this sort of market validation?",5.0,6,2013-10-09,ECOM,0.036105554550886154,0.929826557636261,0.03406786546111107

ecommerce,Trying to break into Drop Shipping.,"Hello everyone. First I'd like to say how amazing this place is and how helpful many of the post have been regarding my research. I've been lurking for a while but now I hope to start contributing to the community. 

I am looking to start a E-Commerce site using the Drop Shipping business model. I am a Front End Developer that's looking to generate some extra revenue on the side. 

Here's the thing. I'm not looking to make a tons of cash with this project. I am just trying to turn a profit. Seriously I would be happy making anywhere between $200-$500 a month. More than happy really lol. I've read 4hww, tons of guides, and have a good grasp on the business model and the ppc scene. I have a lot of niche ideas however I am somewhat afraid to pull the trigger. 

Given the low overhead since I am a web designer myself, how likely is it that I'll make any sort of money? I guess I am just looking for votes of confidence or some stories of success. I am not trying to earn a salary like income or anything, just any profit at all. Is this likely???

Thank in advance,
-an Ecommerce Newbie

I recently started an e-cigarette e-commerce site (built on bigcommerce) after selling on eBay for a while and wanting to step things up. I set up the site using paypal as the payment method until I could build up a large enough client base to make a proper payment processor/gateway feasible. Anyway, the inevitable happened and paypal froze my account because they do not allow e-cigarette sales. So, my question is, what suggestions do you have as far as a payment method to use for the site which will minimize fixed costs in favor of higher variable costs?

I've been reading about making sure pages are cached and that some further optimizations are made to reduce page load speeds and such.

At this point I'm thinking I'd like to launch it live and then work out any problems or kinks as they come up and finish some slight front end work. I'm backed up and restored the XAMMP settings so I have barebones knowledge of knowing I need to import the database in and make sure authentication issues are okay between the magento install and database.

I want to be able to detect the currently displayed item's brand (OR /brand/_____ in the URL) in the header/footer in order to apply custom styling and images... to give a ""branded"" store feel without running 5+ stores.

unfortunately, the Brands plugin has little to no documentation. anyone know how to do this sort of thing? I found some similar info here, but it was based on category...

ecommerce,What do you use for search or faceted navigation?,"I've spoken with some of my friends and clients who have eCommerce stores and they aren't satisfied with the default search or the third-party search providers. So, I've created a solution for a couple of them and I'd like to see if I can extract the common features and either turn them into an app or just streamline my process.

What I'd like to do is talk to store owners and developers who have a need for a better and more comprehensive eCommerce site search and learn about what features they need the most.

I've created a quick survey if you are interested: http://bit.ly/1iukCGY",0.0,1,2013-10-30,ECOM,0.02025553770363331,0.9325043559074402,0.04724003002047539
ecommerce,SAP feeds directly into e-commerce shop?,"hello together,
hopefully someone will be able to help me on this one:
Would this process be possible:
Client gets an invoice, which is created in SAP. Each client has a unique number. SAP creates a hyperlink which includes this unique number. 
If the client clicks on the hyperlink, will he then automatically be forwarded to the website that will be specific to him? Hence, he can then order other things on the online shop, and then click ""Order"" and the form will already be filled out with his contact details? 
(actually no credit card online shop is needed, they just want that whatever the client orders, will generate an email - the specific sales person will then take it from there. 
they are speaking of creating a mediocre online shop from oscommerce.com

thanks so much!
