dropship,taxation and nexus,"Hi. I just found this subreddit and I am hoping you can help me understand the issues of the taxation and nexus of a drop-shipment. 

I have done some research into this (this sight seemed to offer the most concise and clear description: [Link](http://www.salestaxadvisors.com/v4.2/tax/drop/))

How do you handle this on a daily basis? Does whatever software you are using allow you to detect where someone is and collect taxes for that state? Do you just adjust your prices to account for any extra costs and then worry about it later? Am I reading too much into this? 

I really appreciate y'alls help and input. Thanks!",1,4,2012-05-06,ECOM,0.01849200390279293,0.9147148132324219,0.06679321825504303

I cancelled my Tax ID number and stopped paying taxes as I currently only do a small handful of side jobs.

dropship,How to find good dropshippers,"I'm not going to really mention niche/product research. I'm assuming that you've already done your research and have a good idea of a decent niche.

I think that the harder a dropshipper is to find, the better that they're going to be, since less people are working with them. Everybody knows about DOBA, you're not going to be a unique butterfly if you sell their products. WorldWideBrands has a lot of dropshippers, I wouldn't pay $300 for access. I think many of the dropshippers in these indexes aren't very responsive to inquiries since they are used to tirekickers, and people who are wasting their time.

After you've decided what your niche is going to be, you are going to look for dropshippers. Just go to Google, and search for

* **niche product manufacturer**

* **niche product wholesale/ wholesaler**

* **niche product dropship / dropshipper**

You are going to find a lot of garbage sites. Lots and lots of spammy sites offering their crappy dropshipping ebook/index, or affiliate link to DOBA/WWB, etc, alibaba, etc. But there are good sites out there too, you just have to find them.

There will be some big sites with hundreds and thousands of products. There will be mom &amp; pop businesses with terrible websites designed in Frontpage and gifs from 1997 (these can be good since their legit businesses with terrible online presence).

And now you're going to contact each of these sites. You can call, or email (I just email since it's a lot easier for me to do since I have a dayjob). You're not going to hear from all of them, but write a good email, and you might get a response. And this is a great way to find good dropshipping sources. Keep a spreadsheet so you know exactly what sites you contacted, and when. You wouldn't want to send the exact same email multiple times, since they're going to assume it's just assume. I would wait a week or two, and write again to any sites that you didn't hear from the first time (make sure to mention that you'd previously written and hadn't received a response), letting them know that you're serious.

I found my first dropshipper from WorldWideBrands, but I found a much better dropshipper by doing research and contacting manufacturers. I'll make more profit from dropshipping their products, then I will from the WWB dropshipper. Also I'm going to have more competition with the WWB dropshipper's products, since other people are offering the same products.

After I sent a second followup email to the companies that I hadn't heard back from the first time, another one of them wrote back to me. They're definitely a good source, and I will probably integrate their products in the future.

**The harder that you have to work to find a good dropshipping source, the less likely it is that someone else took those same steps!**


I'm not dropshipping yet, but I'm completely setup to offer the dropshipping. I'm still working on completing an ecommerce store (I suck at graphics work, but I'm learning) with Shopify.

dropship,Any interest in a dropshippers guild?,"This subreddit is really small so I'm not sure this will have any positive results, but reddit is my favorite place (literally, I feel like an addict sometimes) and this is as targeted as it gets, so I think this is a great place for this.

Brief personal synopsis: I used to do dropshipping with a metal manufacturer 5 years ago and made a living off of it for a couple years until the website I ran was bought out (not for a ton, or I'd be on a beach somewhere). I'm a developer now that freelances and has tried some subscription sites and other oddball businesses.

Anyway, to the point, I'm dropping everything and moving to NYC over the next 8 months to create a dropshipping business. In my experience, it's always optimal to have a tight network of people who help eachother forward in what they commonly specialize in. And so I'd like to see if any of you would be interested in creating an exclusive guild, where we can share data, experience, knowledge, tips, tricks, stories!, and everything else, as we create our businesses and try to ""make it"".

I expect to know a decent amount more about the web than a lot of you starting out, and that's fine. For this type of field in particular it's far less about what you currently know, and far more about how hard of a worker you are, and how quick you are at picking things up. It's not like programming where you simply must have X amount of years to be able to pull off job Y. However, if you know literally nothing, this isn't for you. We want strong allies, not students.

This isn't something that's going to happen overnight. I'd just like to start building a network now, and then once we have a strong group, we can setup a private forum and other ways to leverage our knowledge to help eachother succeed.

If you're very serious about this (and if you aren't, just think about it for a week before you make contact) make a post and send me a PM and let's talk.",14,10,2012-05-12,ECOM,0.027787385508418083,0.9340654015541077,0.038147155195474625

ecommerce,Having a real hard time getting any sales,"I started up a eCommerce website mainly retailing aftermarket performance parts. I have had a real difficult time getting any sales. I recently started up an ad campaign on both Facebook and AdWords/Google but they have only yielded me 2 clicks so far.
I have about 89 items currently listed most of which are ""universal."" Do I not have enough items?
Should I set up a Twitter and Facebook Fan page to try to boost sales? I'm striking out pretty badly here.
I'm not sure where the problem lies. My shopping cart software is Zen-Cart. It is rather decent looking and I accept payments through PayPal Express. I do not think my check out is an issue as the customers don't even make an account to checkout.

Any point in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!
