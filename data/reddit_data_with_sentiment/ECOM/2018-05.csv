I've been looking everywhere for an app that allows me to set up questions for a customer that leads them to the product most suitable for them.

dropship,How to deal with returns overseas,I’ve recently started drop shipping Print on demand shirts. I have my first refund request. I live in the Uk but the order is in the US and was sent from the US. I was thinking I could maybe I could get them returned to a good will or charity or something? I don’t know anyone in the US. I’d rather not let the customer keep them as I don’t want people to clock on that that’s my process and then request refunds all the time and keep the item and it’s a large order. Also as it’s print on demand should I be stating that I don’t accept refunds as the Tshirts are made to order? I don’t really wana do this as it might discourage people from buying in the first place. I started in Feb and this is my first refund request so it’s not too bad. Reason for customer return is late delivery as there was a delay at printers and it didn’t arrive on time. So even with no returns policy I would have to refund them.,5,6,2018-05-01,ECOM,0.22135984897613525,0.7385436296463013,0.04009651765227318

4. Email marketing platform (mailchimp or icontact)

ecommerce,Facebook keeps disabling every account I create AARGH!,"**I’m sorry for such a long\-winded post \- but I’m in dire need of some help..**

A bit of a backstory \- I permanently deleted my personal Facebook account about 2 years ago. Fast forward 2 years…

I’ve spent the past month or so building my store and was thrilled to test out ads on Facebook. I created a business page on FB, posted on it for about a week or two \(so Facebook wouldn’t think I’m a bot creating a fb then immediately creating a business page/running ads\).

I hadn’t even gotten as far as running an ad with the first fb account I created when fb disabled my account “due to suspicious activity.”

So I went through the whole process of uploading a picture of myself for fb to verify my identity. After 3 weeks of them not verifying/giving me access back, I created another fb account under my name again.

That time, I got so far as to running a few ads to test out some products. I even got so far as to adding my credit card/payment info. As soon as the ad was approved \(the ad did NOT go against fb guidelines\), my 2nd account was disabled.

I have now created about 12 fb accounts, and each time, they deactivate every single time. I have tried everything and have run out of options. I now believe fb has permanently put my name on the spam list, which I won’t be able to create another facebook under my name.

I also read online that if you try to use the same credit card information when creating ads, fb will link the cards to your suspended acct, and will immediately deactivate that account \(which has happened, numerous times\).

I’ve tried using different IPs, different WIFI locations, ect. I have tried anything and everything with no avail.

I’ve even gone as far as creating a Fb account under my partner’s name, with his credit card info, etc… That account was disabled as well \(and this was on a brand new MacBook Pro with a different IP\)!!!

I’m lost and don’t know what I can do at this point. It’s so infuriating to not have done ANYTHING to have my accounts disabled. I have used fb and run ads in the past for my business a couple of years back and had no issues. I’m aware of the fb guidelines with the ads/business page and did not violate any guidelines.

Does anyone have any recommendations? I feel as if I just wasted 1\-2 months of my time picking a niche, finding products, building and designing a website, for this to keep happening.

I have spent the last few months building a retail store and brand, and running some ads.  We did get some sales, but a large portion of our customers were leaving on checkout.  I believe this has to do with the fact that we are using Paypal, and it brings you to an external site.

I am outside of the USA \(although a USA citizen\), so the reason I am using paypal is because I have found it virtually impossible to find ANY BANK that will set us up with a business account.  I have an LLC for the business in order to protect my personal assets.

So today I tried to apply for Paypal Pro, in order to integrate the payment system directly onto shopify so users don't have to leave.  Paypal rejected me, saying I am too high risk because I am out of the country and they don't understand the dropshipping business model.

I got an email from PayPal saying the buyer disputed the charge and eventually the case was settled in the buyer’s favor. I called PayPal and they said the chargeback was initiated by the credit card (Citibank), not PayPal, and so I can’t appeal.

I’ve been in touch with the buyer via email and he says he tried to cancel the charge back but was unable. The person at PayPal told me she saw multiple requests from the buyer to cancel the case but because it was initiated by the credit card company his request was denied.

At one point the buyer mentioned that his “family” noticed the charge and reported it as fraudulent. So perhaps this is a kid using his parents’ credit card or something, or perhaps it is a stolen card.

At this point I’m not sure what to do. I don’t have the credit card number and PayPal won’t give it to me. I only know it is Citibank because the buyer told me. I am not even sure I have the name on the card because it might not be his card. I was going to try to call Citibank to challenge the charge back but don’t have much to go on.

I don’t really want to call the police and/or file a legal claim but at this point I’m not sure what else to do. I have I think pretty clear evidence tying the PayPal id to the product download. Any advice welcome.",10,5,2018-05-04,ECOM,0.05144494026899338,0.9205092191696167,0.028045805171132088

ecommerce,Best E-commerce Method to Monetize My Knowledge?,"Hi, so i'll try and keep this quick. I'm comparing a few different ways of making money online by promoting different products within a niche. Drop-shipping sounds like a simple starting option, so I was thinking of creating a shopify store and placing products in there to first make some money.

HOWEVER, I have a large amount of knowledge of nutrition, fitness and psychology that I was going to display by starting a blog (which would help drive traffic) and doing some sort of affiliate marketing to products I truly believe in (through Amazon or other wholesalers). This would take a little longer, but it may be more sustainable.

So basically I wanted to know of any strategies to combine these or if I should just focus on one. I don't think I should link my blog posts to a shopify store where I'm only selling high converting products that I would dropship, as it may discredit my reputation. But I don't know if affiliate marketing would allow me to make much money for a LONG while until I'm more established. 

Should I focus on shopify first and improve my ecommerce ability, then maybe blog later? Should I forget about finding selling products for quicker $$ and give my all into a blog? Or is there anyway to combine the two approaches?

ecommerce,Which route should I take?,"I have already posted this in another ecommerce related sub but I can also find valuable answers here as well;

So I own a rolls Royce and Bentley Instagram page with over 120k+ followers. My followers are really engaged and I’ve made a good amount of money selling shoutouts and such but, I’m looking to expand the monetization of it. That’s when I came to rediscover dropshipping.

I have spent time learning the basics of it in the past but put it on the back burner as I found learning to grow Instagram pages to be a lot more fun.

Now with the page I feel inclined to make a store for it but do not know which road to take. Print on Demand or Drop ship some items? Since it’s a rolls Royce and Bentley page I have spent time on AliExpress finding items for both and have stumbled upon keychains, cufflinks, and flags so far. The items are all incredibly cheap so I feel inclined to do a Free+ just pay S&amp;H offer. I feel that will bring in easy money for sure but I want longevity and I’m not sure if even doing that is a good idea since it would be a trademarked item and it’s most likely be bad for me to do since some of the official RR and Bentley pages follow my page as well and would probably see that I’m selling their trademarked shit and praying that I don’t wake up to a nice little cease and desist via DM or something . I also just really don’t want to disrespect them by doing so. I’d ideally just promote it on my Instagram stories, with a post, and link in bio. But that’s that for just drop shipping regular items with the trademark.

Now for Print on Demand I understand you definitely need an award-winning design. I have a few in mind that I will be asking my Audience if they like it or not. My only issue with print on demand is I can’t mark up the prices as high as I’d want to and then there is the issue of trying to keep up steam with selling the merchandise in the long term. I definitely could release more designs in the future to keep it going but idk I’m still a bit wary of it. Regardless of that I’m still willing to try.

Now with all of that being said which route do you think I should take for my situation? Try and Dropship some of the Trademarked items or go the POD route and figure out the rest in terms of long term? Or can I do a combination of both? 🤨",7,4,2018-05-06,ECOM,0.07858338952064514,0.8976361155509949,0.02378048747777939

ecommerce,Visual Trends For eCommerce: Rich Media and Product Photo Techniques That Will Increase Sales,"Also posted in /r/entrepreneur

Today it's not enough to showcase your products with a simple description and color option. Your client is more sophisticated. And your job is to keep them craving for more with EXCELLENT product visuals.

We talked to Blue Hamel, the Social Content Producer at Ogilvy &amp; Mather and learned a lot about visual trends in E-commerce. Here are the main takeaways:

1. Use animation. Here is what Blue thinks about a visual part of the e-commerce business today: “Animation attracts the consumer because it brings a story to life.” So, tell a story with your product and make it more engaging. It surely will make you stand out in the market.

2. Use 360° Product View. Btw, experimenting with 360° product views brought Golfsmith.com an increase in conversion rates that were at least 10 percent – and for some products up to 40 percent more conversions.

3. Leverage video content. Cathy McManus, the Stacksandstacks marketing director, says that shoppers are 144% more likely to add a product to their cart if they’ve watched the product video than if they haven’t. The types of visuals you can create:

   ➡ Instructional videos. 73% of consumers say that they are more likely to buy a product if they watch a branded video that explains the product or service.

  ➡ Catwalks. 96% of consumers find videos helpful when making purchase decisions online. It’s hard to imagine the beauty of a folded dress while walking down the street or understand how exactly that shirt will fit you.

4. Hacks for product photos. Some of them may seem obvious. At least, you could use this as a checklist to make sure everything works great.

  ➡ Always use large images. FYI, Skinner Auctions tested whether increasing the size of their product images from 250 pixels to 350 pixels wide would increase conversion rates.Their results were astonishing with 63% more of visitors starting the bidding process and a huge 329% more visitors completing all the forms necessary to make a bid.

  ➡ Use images with high-resolution. Your visitors zoom into your product to see fabric structure and fine details. Make sure the images aren’t blurry or pixelated. They are HUGE NO-NO.

 ➡ Make it clear. Is it clear from the photo what you sell? You sell a product first, not a photo composition. You can attach an additional photo to show the atmosphere, but it shouldn’t be the one and only.

 ➡ Product carousels. Why not take three to five photos of a product from different angles, or close-ups of certain features, and upload them as part of a series behind your awesome hero photo? This will enhance your visitors viewing experience compared to using only one photo.

 ➡ Background consistency. The rule of product image backgrounds is that the background should not conflict with or distract the viewer from the product. It seems to be clear. But what is often neglected is a common picture of your product collection. Never mix vector photos with compositional – it looks cheap and your buyer may have some doubts whether you really have the product you are selling them.

Make sure you’ve stolen and implemented some ideas.

Any questions? I’m here to answer!

I want to take advantage of this time to develop passive/remote income streams. I've watched a few YouTube tutorials and ostensibly dropshopping can provide this. I wanted to solicit advice from those without a commercial incentive to promote dropshopping as viable for a higher view count. Is it conceivable/actionable to generate 500$ a month in income from dropshopping? What is the timeline/roadmap to acheiving this? If there are any informational resources that might be helpful, please let me know where. Any advice is welcome.

ecommerce,Confused on Article 14 GDPR requirements for 3rd party processors as it pertains to ecommerce - can someone help?,"## Question relating to ecommerce reseller situations and GDPR.

Art. 6 states that it's legal to process data when \- ""processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;""

So to fulfill a sale.

Art. 14 states that if you obtained personal data \(such as name, address, email, phone number\) not directly from the data subject, you have to notify the data subject \(i.e end customer\) that you have their data and what you will use it for. \- like if someone sells our product as a reseller and we have to deliver it.

Does that mean that 3rd parties like suppliers or fulfillment operators need to notify all end consumers that they have their data and that they will use it to deliver their product?

clarity on this is immensely appreciated. RR",2,7,2018-05-08,ECOM,0.03141973540186882,0.9424648284912109,0.026115404441952705

Go to your Admin&gt;Online Store&gt;Themes&gt;Actions&gt;Edit code

Under **Templates**  select product.liquid, and find {{ product.vendor }} and change it to {{ product.vendor | link_to_vendor }}

dropship,Problem with AliExpress Supplier,"Hey everyone, long time lurker of r/dropship here, first post on reddit. After lurking here for quite some time and gathering a lot of valuable information, I decided to finally give drop shipping a go. I know that Shopify+AliExpress+Oberlo method isn’t the most ideal way to go, but I decided to start with that to get an idea of the inner workings of dropshipping and Shopify. 

After finally settling on a niche, I found an AliExpress supplier that had everything I wanted in my store. I contacted them a little bit about dropshipping and they seemed like a great company. They had a 98% feedback score with 100,000+ sales and great reviews. I started building my Shopify store around the items they offered. 

After getting my store setup I had a buddy make a few test purchases from my store (one purchase through Shopify payments and one through PayPal.) Some of the items they have, you have to pay for ePacket, some say ePacket is free. The first item he purchased, I had to pay an extra 1.50 for ePacket. I don’t mind paying extra if my items get to my customers faster. I eventually got the shipping confirmation and it was sent ePacket, awesome. 

The second item purchased was free ePacket. It was pretty much the exact same item in a different color but more expensive. I was assuming the more expensive price was them factoring in the ePacket price so they could put free shipping with ePacket on the product page. When I received the shipping confirmation for this one it said it had been shipped through China small post, which most of you know, takes much longer. 

I contacted the supplier and they said if the item is under $7 they ship China small post even though China small post isn’t even a shipping option on the item. It also does not state this anywhere on their product page. Also, the first item purchased was under $7 and sent with ePacket. We went back and forth about it and they finally said that if I want items that say free ePacket actually shipped with ePacket, I would have to pay extra. They said, “if you place the order, please do not make the payment and leave the message to tell us, we will check and adjust the price to you, and then , we will send you the parcel via e packet.” This just seems sketchy and like a lot of unnecessary work. 

Are they obligated through AliExpress to send the item with ePacket if it is the chosen and displayed option? Im hesitant to file a dispute because I don’t want to cause problems with the company I’m wanting to do business with. Have any of you ever ran into this problem, how did you go about solving it other than switching suppliers? 

I’ve at least learned a valuable lesson from this. Always order a few items from your potential suppliers before doing anything else, even if they have great reviews.",4,9,2018-05-11,ECOM,0.0379503108561039,0.9228201508522034,0.03922949731349945

dropship,"3 questions about dropshipping, tracking packages, tax info, automating shipping","How does tracking information and quoting shipping times work when you're whitelabel dropshipping from many different vendors all over the US/world? How would customers be able to track packages but not know where they are coming from?

Most things I have read about dropshipping makes it seem very simple. Granted, there are many articles and videos also saying the opposite. Between getting an LLC and an FEIN and all of that, to tax information it seems very complicated. Are people creating excel spreadsheets of all of their vendors, purchases people are making, and money they are spending on their business?

Final question. Is there a way to automate shipping stuff? Like, a way for someone to place an order through your site, then have your vendor notified that an order needs to be placed, then have it shipped without you personally having to monitor that and manually notify vendors etc.? We are using multiple Etsy vendors and it seems like it could get very complicated when orders start being placed at high volumes.

dropship,7 Rules of Dropshipping,"Hey guys! Found these 7 rules of dropshipping, simple enough to fit on an index card. I thought it was useful, so decided to share.

### 7 Rules of Dropshipping

* Have excellent product descriptions.
* Constantly test new products for winners.
* UPSELL! Always get your customer to buy multiple products at a discount.
* Look at other Shopify stores to find best sellers.
* Focus on making your site look organized. No one wants to buy from shady websites.
* Focus on other sales channels besides Facebook. Instagram, Pinterest and Forums are your friend.
* Run a general store, then niche down on winners.

ecommerce,"One year ago I wasted $3000 dropshipping. Be honest, would it be a terrible idea for me to try again?","Alright so one year ago I learnt about ecom, wasted $3000 on ads etc. Didn’t make much profit at all and gave up because I had no money left to continue. I was an idiot for continuing but I believed that I had to make these failures in order to learn, I truly believed that if I kept going, things would change. They did not. 

After losing the $3000, I discovered that an acquaintance had many of the well known dropshipping courses (Adrian Morrison etc etc, I believe he downloaded them illegally) and was able to take several of them. I feel that I learnt a great deal from the courses but was still cautious that I was going to lose significant amounts of money again. Of course you’re always going to lose money in testing and even more as a beginner, but I really just can’t stand the idea of flushing another few grand down the toilet, only to fail again. 

I am a member of many of the ecom facebook groups and have noticed people complaining more about how facebook ads are even harder now. People have of course been saying that since the beginning, people will ALWAYS complain but it does seem that things are even worse than 1-1.5 years ago from what I’m reading. 

I have $1000 left, do you think I could be profitable using that amount and that amount only? I can also take more of the courses as it has been a year since I last did one and they are probably out of date now. 

Or perhaps there is another form of ecom you would recommend? Amazon? How about instagram shoutouts for dropshipping?

dropship,How I go about picking products,"hey whats up guys!

To find a product to sell it needs to have three things:

1. It has to actually be something your target market wants. Survey people in that demographic, see what they think and what their tastes are. Don't pick a product that you like, pick what they like
2. It has to come from a supplier that will actually deliver the product you chose and in the right size/color in a timely manner. Sellers that have high amounts of orders and reviews are easier to check for this.
3. You have to actually be able to get enough high\-quality pictures of the product for your website and instagram.

I talk about this in my lastest dropshipping vlog, so I hope you guys check it out!

ecommerce,ATTENTION DROPSHIPPERS: Think about whether your niche will accept shit quality items before launching your store.,"This post is for all you dropshippers out there. Let's be honest, the vast majority of stuff from Ali Express is shit. I'm not saying it's unusable, but the quality in general is shit.

If I made a store selling fidget spinners fine, quality doesn't matter that much and with a lower cost product like that most people probably won't even care that much if quality is shit.

That said, if you were selling Wingsuits or Parachutes, people who buy those items and who's lives are in the hands of that equipment probably wouldn't want to buy from you. Ali Express probably doesn't even sell this stuff but just making a point.

Here's my point guys, earlier today I saw a guy selling ""expedition gear"" on here. He was selling tents, sleeping pads, etc. If you want to start a survival store you can probably get away with selling shitty multi-tools and paracord bracelets, but nobody who's a serious outdoorsman and camper, let alone someone who actually goes on ""expeditions"" is going to be satisfied with Ali Express quality items. These people are used to buying stuff at stores like REI who sell superior quality items and will take a return on an item 3 years later.

My point is this, think about what type of store your opening up. If quality is a big component of the items people are buying and your dropshipping from Ali Express it's not going to workout.",14,43,2018-05-14,ECOM,0.04430994763970375,0.9238203763961792,0.031869690865278244
ecommerce,"Dropshipping is not dead, and it does not equal ""ship crap things from China slowly""","I've seen a lot of threads this week on how dropshipping is dead because people won't accept poor quality AliExpress items that take 2\-3 weeks to get to them.

While I don't really care if people think it is dead or not while it continues to feed my kids, for the newcomers, please don't think AliExpress = dropshipping \(by the way, I know plenty who make a tidy sum dropshipping AliExpress products still\).

AliExpress suppliers generally are small guys, some with 20 person factories, trying to make a living like you.

Start chatting with them, get on WeChat and build the same relationships you can with anyone else. I assure you from personal experience, they will make anything, to any quality you pay for.

Check the bottom of half of the things in your house and see. 

It won't take long after chatting to find out if they really are factories, or just Chinese dropshippers themselves \(agents\). Use a factory inspection service for a couple of hundred dollars if you are really worried.

Easiest sign if they are a factory or not, ask them to modify something for you, add a feature, a logo, custom tagging. If they are a factory, their response should be ""yes"" or ""yes, it will cost you ..."".

**But again dropshipping does not equal ""ship crap things from China slowly"".**

Dropshipping is purely a fulfilment model where the supplier/factory/manufacturer sends the order straight to the customer for you after the customer has already purchased.

It eliminates a large portion of the financial risk for you and makes startup costs negligible as you do not need to ship and warehouse and take on the risk of redundant inventory you can't move.

You can have that arrangement with any supplier for any product anywhere in the world if you can negotiate that with them.

Some suppliers will already be doing it, some don't know what the term ""dropshipping"" means, but are open to it once explained, and others need convincing or proof of sales flow.

So don't be discouraged by the naysayers. 

Worried about delivery times? Go find a US, Canadian, Australian or European supplier. Not sure how? Use services like Salehoo or Storecoach who pre\-check supplier for you. 

Shit, we live in a global marketplace that has never been so open. We can literally sell to the world. Why wouldn't there be a 0.0001&amp;#37; slice of that pie for you to make you comfortable?

There are many more hard working, proud manufacturers wanting their products to get to new areas of the world than there are dropshippers. You just have to show you are professional, responsible and will portray their products they way they want them to be seen.

We live in a time of almost unlimited opportunity. Of course dropshipping is not dead, just misunderstood by those with blinkers on.

dropship,Experimenting with dropshipping. First results negative. I could use your insight.,"Hello. I have many years experience in creating eshops for others and marketing established business through facebook.

I have ideas for various niches.

Before moving forward though and spending a lot of time in research, I tried to do some experiments with very common products to test the effort and cost needed to start selling.
I know that this testing e-shop can't be a huge success I just wanted to justify that it won't be a total failure so I could avoid spending more for bigger similar ventures, or at least modify my math.

So here are the first results of my experiment, which I should say in advance are quite disappointing:

1) Site www.bagsorder.com . Platform Shopify. 
Nothing fancy there but also nothing ugly I think.
I think good enough photos and descriptions.

2) Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/bagsorder/

3) Marketing method.
I chose Facebook Ads and promotions.
You can the see promoted ads on my wall.

I didn't try to put much effort to the ads. My plan was to see how much I can spend with common products and ads before I make the first sale. I know that this numbers will not be profitable from the beginning, but I wanted to have an idea on what kind of fight will be needed to make it profitable.

The first results are disappointing.

I created ads for both the store and specific products.
So far  I have spent $50 which brought me only few hundred likes to the post and the page which doesnt mean much.
Traffic wise 15 people visited the site and had 26 pageviews.
Assuming a reasonable 1.5%-2% conversion rate, I should bring at least 5 times more visitors before Id have a sale, meaning spending more than $250 per sale.

And this is not even a sure things, because the customers brought in didn't engage with the content of the shop at all. Just 1-2 of them clicked 2-3 more pages.

So I would like your insight on this. I know it isn't easy, but this doesnt even seem remotely feasible at the moment.

If this the best option? I really don't want to the customer getting confused on what to purchase. If they have one or more of the items in the pack they can click a ""-"" button which removes the item and updates the price.
I also think the value comes from purchasing all the products in the pack. Has anyone had success with these packs and/or recurring subscriptions ?",1,3,2018-05-15,ECOM,0.028391066938638687,0.9376154541969299,0.03399350494146347
woocommerce,Is WooCommerce capable of handling a multi-vendor classified adverts website,"I have a client that wants a classified adverts website, where users can sign-up and list their products (within a very specific industry) for sale to the public.

https://woocommerce.com/products/product-vendors/ - This looks like it would be a solid way of going about it, but it works on a commission basis. However, the client doesn't want to be a middle man between any transactions, and instead wants to charge users on a per-listing basis, then have buyers message the seller directly and arrange payment between themselves.

Does anyone know of a WooCommerce plugin that can achieve this?

ecommerce,"My Shopify Store is less than a week old. Literally 2 hours ago an influential person (200k+ followers on insta, and 4 million+ followers on Facebook) messaged me and wants to promote my store for a very cheap price. Help Please.","The store has been live for about a month. I’ve made $0 in sales but I’m not discouraged because I haven’t expected any sales yet. I’m excited about the niche and the brand and I’m meticulously building this thing so it’s not a flash in the pan. This is a long term investment and I’m taking my time.

So far I’ve spent $10 on a very helpful 9\-hour udemy course and $29 for my first month of Shopify. That’s it. I’ve successfully fought off the urge to spend a bunch of money on ads to get people to my store because 1\) I want everything to be absolutely perfect before many people see it and 2\) I’m broke as shit and trying to climb out of the deep hole I’ve dug for myself in my 20’s.

Anywho, I downloaded the app Collabor8 last night just to find some influencers that may like to promote my brand. In just one week my social media engagement has grown pretty well organically and I thought I could speed up the growth by using some influencers to get my brand in front of more people.

Much to my surprise, someone quite influential reached out to me today and said they’d love to promote my brand because they love it. They have a total reach of about 5 million people. They offered me a Facebook post, an Instagram post, and a story for $400. They mentioned that they usually charge around $3k for the same service but my brand was something they were passionate about. The post will have my products in the picture, store name in the caption, and store handle in the caption.

I couldn’t help but think that this is too good to be true but the account was verified, the correspondence has not been spammy, I’ve read the reviews from other company’s that have worked with her and I’ve seen their product ads on her page, and the paperwork sent to me checks out with my attorney \(friend\).

So Did hit a home run? It’s basically an opportunity for a prime time television commercial for my store for $400. I really want some advice here or even a reality check. I have about a week and a half before she receives my products so I’d say about 2 weeks before the promotion happens. I want to make everything is air tight \(user friendly checkout, pages working properly, social media profiles on point, etc.\). Also, any idea of what kind of traffic I can expect? And what kind of specific stuff should I be prepared for? The last thing I want to do is get tons of people to my site for the first time ever and fall on my face. If anyone feels compelled to help with a review of my site I’d be happy to DM the link and you can tell me all the things I suck at and I will love you for it.

I think this is an awesome opportunity and I want to nail it, but since I’m new to this I feel kinda like self conscious person being thrown naked out into the street on New Years Eve in Time Square for all to examine... until a \(monetary\) decision is made... based on the performance of my naked arse. In other words, I’m nervous. Thanks in advance for any advice.

Edit:
Thank you to everyone who gave me advice one this. This is why I love Reddit, the brutal honesty and intelligent feedback. I will not be paying this influencer $400, I will use that money for more efficient ad spending. Thank you all for bringing me back down to earth.",47,28,2018-05-16,ECOM,0.030303766950964928,0.9301321506500244,0.03956403583288193

ecommerce,Typical fees for an influence marketer?,"They’re already getting free stuff from me, so why should I pay them? Who’s important enough to actually pay? If they’re influence and reach is good enough to pay for their service, how much should I pay them? 

Currently building my social media presence for my new Shopify store. Everything is going well and I’m happy with the engagement so far and the followers I’m gaining organically. I’d like to expand my horizons a bit and use some targeted influencers (people who are followed by the same type of person that would be most likely to buy my stuff) to promote my store and products for exposure to my brand, gain followers, build credibility, etc. Of course my end goal is to drive as many people to my website and sell as many products as possible, but I understand that this is a marathon and not a sprint. 

With that being said, can anyone give me a general idea about what the typical fees are for influencers based on the amount of followers and engagement they have? I don’t want to get ripped off and I literally have no idea what I should pay for these services.

Specific questions:

How many followers should an influencer have before I even consider paying them for a promotion? More than 1k? More than 5k? More than 10k??

What are typical fees for influencers in different ranges of followers? For example: how much for someone between 1k-10k, 10k-50k, 50k-100k, etc.

I’d like to start with influencers that have a high rate of engagement with anywhere between 2k-50k followers. But any advice here would be nice too.",14,4,2018-05-16,ECOM,0.0206581000238657,0.9325030446052551,0.046838872134685516

dropship,How to Find Hot Selling Dropshipping Products for Shopify in 2018 [Tutorial],"Hi there everyone!

Hope you're doing well. I've just launched a video that might be interesting for those just getting started with Shopify, who perhaps are struggling with their product sourcing and finding products that'll actually sell:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx3GG3BQCGU&amp;t=175s

In this video I cover a single method for sourcing your Aliexpress Dropshipping Products for Shopify. I've dubbed this method as ""Reverse Engineering"" as it takes a 180-degree turn in terms of perspective for finding winning and hot selling Shopify products. 

Before reverse engineering your product sourcing, you simply need to understand basic economics - Supply and Demand. In most cases, the reason Shopify Store owners fail or have continuous issues with acquiring sales - is their lack of understanding of the audiences their promoting to and how their potential audience engages with content online. 

In the video, I use Instagram as a prime tool to search specifically for those within the Scuba Diving niche. and coherently aim to match products based on the audience's choice of engagement. By determining and cross-referencing similar brands or identities online as to the store you're looking to create - you'll inherently have a better perspective as to the products that'd match that audience.

Determining what your audience is actually interested, passionate and willing to spend their money into, you're essentially saving yourself half the battle associated with selling a product for the first time.

It''s mentioned in the video that you should aim to avoid blindly adding products to your store with zero sense as to the audiences anticipations or basic need of such items. There are millions of products sold on Aliexpress and all have their own prospective selling capabilities. It's up to you, the Shopify Store owner, to properly bridge the gap between consumer and product.",1,5,2018-05-17,ECOM,0.04769391566514969,0.9228417277336121,0.0294643584638834

shopify,Mapping quantity to a products weight?,"I have an interesting question here that I have been trying to solve for the past week alone, and have little hair left to pull out.  To make a long story short, for client specifications and accounting reasons, I am trying to get the quantity to automatically reflect the weight of that particular variant being added to the cart *without* showing the quantity selector dropdown.

*For example using grams as a weight measurement:*

Customer goes to the product and adds the 500gram 33 inch length varaint option to their cart.  I want the cart and / or order to reflect quantity 500, instead of quantity 1, or 750 if they chose the 750g option, etc.

How can I go about doing this in the liquid templates?  I've tried using variant.weight as a replacement for the values within the section.settings.show\_quantity\_selector , tried replacing item.quantity in the cart template with variant.weight, and about a few dozen other variations with no success.

I am using the Debut theme just to get this solved, if that has any bearing on how to solve this.

ecommerce,GDPR Checklist,"**What is GDPR?** The General Data Protection Regulation is a regulation enacted by the European Union law. It is an act established by the European Union to protect the data, privacy, and rights for all individuals and members of the European Union. The regulation was enacted on April 14, 2016 and the regulation will be taken into effect on May 25, 2018. 

**Who does the GDPR apply to?** GDPR applies to both data processors and data controllers. GDPR also crosses international borders, potentially affecting millions of small and big corporations alike. i\-Scoop believes 92&amp;#37; of businesses in Europe are not prepared for GDPR, 51&amp;#37; of small and medium businesses believe that GDPR is too complex, and 28&amp;#37; lack awareness of GDPR. These reasons do not provide exceptions to the regulation, and come May 25, 2018, business must be ready. 

**What is at risk?** Corporations and organizations have the potential to lose millions of dollars in penalties and fines. Under Article 83, there are two tiers of penalties, not to mention the reputation the organization could potentially lose with millions of customers across the globe for not cooperating with the new EU enacted law. 

**What can my organization do to be prepared?** With the right strategy and solutions, your organization can be prepared for that May 25 deadline in no time. You need to identify fit\-to\-standard, and fit\-to\-gap strategies that will align your organization’s data standards, policies, and practices to those of GDPR. 

**GDPR: Is your organization ready?** Most US organizations and many EU companies are completely unprepared as we approach the May 25 deadline for GDPR compliance. The General Data Protection Regulation \- otherwise known as GDPR \- is the European Union enacted regulation to protect data, privacy, and rights for all individuals and members of the European Union. The regulation will affect organizations all over the world \- both big and small \- as it seeks to protect the EU citizens. Organizations found to be noncompliant with the regulation will be penalized with large fines \- up to €20,000,000.The regulation will be taken into effect May 25, 2018, with fines effective May 26. 

To clear the air for cynicists in the room, *yes* this regulation will be enforced on *all* business conducted in the EU. The definition of ""in the EU"" is read as any attempt to 1\) obtain/process EU user data, 2\) sell to EU consumers, 3\) deal with EU companies/organizations, 4\) marketing/advertising with EU targeting. The fines are **huge** with the minimum penalty being €10,000,000 up to €20,000,000 OR 4&amp;#37; of y*our gl*obal gross revenue \(which*ever is* greater\). 

***This regulation applies to US COMPANIES*** 

Frankly speaking, the PR around this regulation as been poor outside of the EU, but still not thorough enough for even all EU businesses to comply. For all ecommerce companies here who 1\) sell to EU consumers, 2\) target EU consumers, 3\) obtain/process data on EU consumers \-\-\- here is a GDPR readiness checklist.

* Designated Data Protector Officer
* Proper documentation of process &amp; compliance
* Observant policies for privacy &amp; data protection
* Binding Corporate Rules
* Data &amp; Privacy Impact Assessments
* Data Governance framework
* Incident Management
* Remediation Plan 

Now, this is *extremely* high level, as the technical details of each bullet point create cumbersome documentation and require proper strategy to roll out effectively. Similar to taxes, some of you with lower revenue stores may be able to dance around this regulation and make up documentation / evidence on the fly \-\- but for those of you who are running successful, multi\-year healthy revenue companies, *we implore you* to take this seriously. 

There's nothing funny about losing **€10,000,000**. No matter how many times you will say ""I won't, there's no way."" 

If you don't have the time to act on those checklist items and become compliant within \(approximately\) the next 103 hours, feel free to PM us. We're here to answer your questions over the next 103 or so hours.

dropship,how do i beat my competitors?,"i discovered a niche about a week ago that i knew could be profitable, so i went ahead and started testing some ads. however, today i found out that there is already a major competitor that is dominating this niche. has about 100k facebook fans on his page and very loyal followers. at first i got discouraged and wanted to quit and find a new niche because it seems that this guy is running the show. but i've thought about it and i'm thinking that i want to compete against him..

i already plan to scrape all the people who liked his page, make a custom audience, and start sending ads to them. my question is, how can i beat this competitor in the long run? he's very far ahead with about 1.5k products listed. i'll be starting from scratch. i know it's unethical to try and do things to hurt his brand such as negative SEO, negative reviews, etc. but how else do i get ahead? my discomfort is that even if i do well i'll still have his big brand looming over mine

UPDATE: i decided that i'm going to ditch this niche due to this crazy fucker having this niche on lock down. he has a fuckton of loyal followers and plenty of products. he even started offering 2 day shipping on some of his stuff. he's a crazy mother fucker, already milking this niche dry so it's best i not even bother. i found a different niche though. fairly similar, but this one has little competition. of course there are jerk off competition that are trying to do this niche, but i've seen a few of their sites and they are terrible. in particular my main ""competitor"" would be a guy with 3k facebook page likes and 0 engagement on his posts. all his products are over priced and his website sucks with some pages that won't even load. because of this i'm confident i can blow him out of the water which is great. i'm going to work on this new niche by testing a few easy products to start getting some initial success. if i can keep getting good results that's when i'll open a fresh store tailored to this niche and truly go hard",8,2,2018-05-20,ECOM,0.028709685429930687,0.8979964852333069,0.07329383492469788

ecommerce,Looking for ideas to boost online sales on my company's web site,"I've worked as the sole Marketing &amp; IT person at my company for about 6 years now and our e-commerce store has always been in the backseat of our business with little to no love. Our company's primary focus is on distributors and that part consumes 80% of my time, but the online I still believe the web store has tons of potential. Most of our web store business comes from when we return from a trade show or in the event someone writes about us, but it doesn't happen as often as we'd like and sales are abysmal compared to our other channels.

Only issue is when large projects arise with distributors, we have drop the progress we make on these fronts. Sales don't seem to rise or fall very much, but I feel like we're missing something big that I can't quite put my finger on.

dropship,I'm about to start my business - will I be okay?,"Hi everyone, I’m in the process of creating a brand and I was wondering if I could receive any suggestions or pointers on what I intend to do so far:

1.	Register as an LLC: I know about the legal protections it provides, plus obviously it makes you more legitimate. I may as well do this first before anything (unless someone disagrees).

2.	Understand my niche: I know what I want to sell and who my target audience is. I tested the keywords on google trends, the alidropship tool, and a few other websites. What are some other ways that I can test my niche? How do I know if I’ll have a lot of competition? Also, I have an idea for my brand that would make it slightly unique and according to what I've found on google, nothing like it exists yet. Should I take any precautions before pursing this?

3.	Find a supplier: I don’t want customers to deal with long shipping times so I’m looking for a supplier in my country. Most suppliers I’ve found so far have their website set up to let people buy in bulk. Should I contact them and ask them if they can dropship? Or, do I not dropship, buy in bulk, and assume the risk if the products don’t sell? (hopefully this isn’t stupid to ask on a dropshipping subreddit, lol) Also, is it wrong that I’m more focused on the group of products I intend to sell rather than a single product? Only asking because that seems to be the case in a lot of the posts I read on here.

4.	Think of a brand name/set up shopify/buy a domain: self-explanatory

5.	Advertise: So far, I’ve heard of Facebook Ads and Google Adsense. What are the other platforms I can advertise on? Also, how do I “test” an ad?

6.	Find an influencer: My vague idea of this: you find someone that is relevant to your target audience on Instagram (?) with a lot of followers, and pay them to post about your product. I would appreciate any more information or clarity about this.

ecommerce,"Just launched my new web store this week, would love some feedback","So my store is at www.zbqfanclub.com/shop

The gear is all-original created by my own hands. I've been selling my line of t-shirts and clothes since way back in 1998 but in recent years things got a lot more low-key, I just moved everything on to Etsy and focussed on improving my sewing skills. But last year I decided I wanted a full-on web store again so I started putting together a ton of new product. The entire process took over a year and was frustrating at times but I'm pretty proud of the results.

A few notes: this is a ""Pattern"" store by Etsy.I went with them because I already had an Etsy store, so I didn't have to re-list anything. It's half the monthly rate of Shopify's cheapest package and functions well enough for me now.  I'm really not super stoked on Pattern's lack of flexibility tbh but the price is right and having built my own web stores from the ground up in the past I can tell you that I am NOT interested in putting that much time and work into that again. 

A few concerns:   that maybe I have too many products for starters? That offering free shipping is a good option (I think it is)? I also have far too few shots of actual people wearing the gear and I realize that, but that will be remedied soon.

ecommerce,Recently inherited an ecommerce site - halp.,"I was recently promoted at my company to ""digital marketing manager"", which means I'm responsible for our website and pretty much all marketing. 

I'm not a total stranger to websites - I graduated college in 2011 with a bachelors in graphic design and interactive media, but my specialty was in visual effects not web design. My career took a way different path, which has led my to where I am now. We're a small but well established business. Our website went unmaintained for about 8 months before my promotion, and the guy who ran it before me was an old school print marketer who really did nothing but make sure the website was still functioning. Before him we had an outside team of web developers who (in my opinion) did a bang up job of creating a website that doesn't really work for our business model. 

With all of that said, we're an established business with some name recognition and a decent customer base (roughly 1,200 sessions daily, and averaging about a 1% conversion rate)

Some fast facts:

- We are a laboratory equipment and supply distributor, and sell primarily B2B. Our website is both a ecommerce portal to check out, and also functions as a catalog of our items for users to check out (often times the end user lab techs browse what they want then make a list for their purchasing agent or lab manager to buy, though some labs have p-cards for their end users to buy directly).
- We currently do under $1mil on the web, but want to increase by about 20% this year. 
- Our ecommerce platform right now is ke-commerce... I have nothing positive to say about them. Their backend is slow and clunky, their support is almost non-existant, things break often, and they had to do a lot of weird workaround to accommodate some of our most basic requests when building the website. To make it worse our website was very obviously built for B2C, when we are at our core a B2B business. Their only upside is they sync directly with NAV, our ERP.
- We currently have 17k SKUs (arranged as family pages where multiple related items live on 1 page) on the website, and 80k SKUs overall in our full catalog.
- Budget is a factor. We had about $30k budgeted this year for web enhancements, which quickly got eaten up (I signed on for a third party search engine, Nextopia, to fix our bare bones built in search engine, and had ke-commerce build a connection to port over our competitor codes from our ERP to the web so that they can be indexed and searched. This was embarrassingly expensive for a really simple 1 field connection, and took up most of our budget for the year)

Some questions I have:

1. I would really like to pitch getting a new ecommerce platform by 2020, but haven't had a lot of experience. Shopify and Magento stand out as companies who've tried to market to me before. Anyone have a recommendation for our situation based on the above facts? I need something with as low of an up front cost without cutting too many corners. 
2. What other tips would you give? I feel like I'm juggling a lot and learning a lot, since the world of ecommerce is so new to me, but I'm passionate about our company and products, and really want to do well at my job.",9,8,2018-05-23,ECOM,0.04004162549972534,0.9289235472679138,0.031034817919135094

ecommerce,Trying to Understand Buying Behavior of Hispanic Customers,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, and I know this might be a sensitive subject to discuss. But with full professionalism intended, I have an online business that specializing in selling professional AV equipment. These are big ticket items where people are not always familiar the equipment technology, so we provide consultation to assist our customers with getting the right products and close the sale.

I run a lot of targeted social media ads to build awareness of our store, and I have gotten some great leads from it. However, I also get a lot of quote requests and Facebook messenger replies from potential Hispanic customers. Particularly ones who do not speak English very well. 

The ads outline how it we make it easy for people to buy directly online \(unlike our competition\) and I'm pretty sure Facebook is translating these ads. But a lot of these requests/leads we get from our Hispanic shoppers are kind of mundane. Like requests for information that's clearly listed on the website, such as the the price on a particular product. Or requests that ask for location or directions of our store when we sell exclusively online. It's like some are not even taking the time to browse website.

Now let me make it clear, that we are NOT discriminating against our Hispanic customers. I want to expand my market into Mexico. We try and want to help them as much as we can, but I want to understand if there is a different type of shopping behavior for this market so we can better assist. Because overall, this has been pretty frustrating and starting to become a waste of time because many times they do not buy. Some even leading us on to all the way to sending an invoice then never hear from them again. 

I've went ahead and added multiple languages on my site. But I'm curious to see if any other store operators experience this and how they handle it.

Aliexpress) would now legally have to inform their customer that they are sharing their personal details with a third party, in this case they'd need to name the Aliexpress merchant and explain the reason for sharing the data.

shopify,$50k/month selling Anxiety Reducing Blankets,"Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com here with another interview.


Today's interview is with Aaron and Lior, the founders of Hush Blankets, a brand that makes weighted, anxiety reducing blankets.


**Some stats:**

* Revenue/mo: $50,000
* Started: January 2018
* Location: Toronto, Ontario
* Founders: 2
* Employees: 1

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hey there! We’re two young entrepreneurs from Toronto working hard to control this ""side hustle"" which is rapidly turning into our main business because of it’s fast growth.

Our product, Hush Blankets, is a weighted blanket that when placed on you, helps instantly reduce anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Our customers are mainly people looking to buy this for their spouses that can’t sleep, or as gifts for other family members. Usually women above 40.

We’ve grown fast, averaging 300% month over month growth, rapidly expanding into new ecommerce channels as well.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Who would have thought that a background in the software and restaurant space would lead to a health product. We’ve always been entrepreneurs, both dropping out of university and with the mindset that we can create more for ourselves than school would ever provide us.

The idea for Hush started when my partner, Lior, worked at an overnight camp for special needs children. They had a room there called the ""Stimulation Room"" and it had all sorts of devices and tools that were sensory-related. One of them was a weighted blanket.

&gt; If your current idea isn’t successful, don’t give up until you’ve hustled at it for 4 months straight.

It was so effective that he kept going back there just to try it out. But it was ugly, and he knew it could be improved.

A couple years later, the Hush Blanket was made into a premium product that any adult can enjoy the benefits from, outside of a hospital or rehab centre.

We both have our own businesses, but we also struggle from stress and sleeping from time to time. Once we started trying our own product, we were in love.

We threw up a quick Shopify site and started running pre-orders. Those flooded in, and we knew our first order was going to sell out quick.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

There is only 2-3 main manufacturer players in the market, but really they’re just textile companies that decided to perfect this and niche down. We are currently looking into keeping our options open by actually owning and controlling the entire manufacturing process from start to finish, which will give us the competitive edge.

The trick is designing the product yourself to be superior and one that everyone will rave about. This consisted of late nights deconstructing prototypes, and even buying every competitor’s blanket until we were satisfied with our first version.

I have limited experience in *physical* product design, except the odd t-shirt or product bag for our juice kitchen. In the beginning, we really had to learn from competitors and limited market research with real people trying our prototypes.

We both funded our first production run ourselves (insanely expensive for textiles, super high barrier to entry), with a loan to the company we paid a lawyer to create.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

Shopify was a natural selection because it’s just so great at e-commerce. We only have one product at the moment, so it was easy to choose a theme based around that.

We’re both marketers by trade, SEO and Social Media, so we knew we had that covered. We’re also lucky to be surrounded by very good friends that run our AdWords and Facebook ads.

Everything was financed by us in the beginning. We pretty much poured everything we had into this, took out 3 credit cards and 2 lines of credits with 2 different banks to help with larger purchases along the way too. Over $80,000 spent, 1200 units on the way and we were ready to start rolling.

The first sale was made the very next day after starting AdWords. Since then, every dollar we make we put back towards either inventory or growth through marketing.

We don’t plan on taking a profit for the entire first year, and we know some of our competitors simply can’t afford to do that, so we’re blessed to have our other businesses that allow us to do that.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

Our biggest growth factor has been AdWords for sure. Most people think it is too expensive, but if you have an A+ ads team, and a decently priced product, it can work well with a lot of room to scale.

The reason it works so well is because people are searching for the unique product where they read about it elsewhere online. Their buyer’s intent leads them to clicking our ad and much more likely to convert. Our homepage is setup like a landing/sales page since we only have one product at the moment so that helped with conversions too.

We’re now spending well into 5-figures a month on advertising, with Facebook for retargeting, and massive plans to use it for cold audiences as well. Every 2 weeks we try another paid platform and that seems to fuel growth even more.

We have a campaign that ""farms"" new keywords that are “long tail keywords”. Once we know people buy through those super unique or buyer-intent keywords, they are moved to a winner campaign. The goal is to eventually have a massive campaign with only winner keywords that we bid on.

&gt;Lead times (the time it takes from manufacturing to warehouse) completely blindsided us in the beginning. It can be incredibly difficult to estimate when and how many units to order.

We are going heavy on video production for cold audience with FB traffic, and we even recently hired a salesperson to call our abandoned carts and give them a personal touch of customer service.

As long as it’s profitable (or break-even in some cases), keep doing it. My biggest advice would be to have enough cash and a *really good* advertiser to be willing to test things for 3-4 months before calling it quits.

We also hired a full time instagrammer to just do social media and find us influencers, which we plan to use as a big channel of traffic.

Email has been huge for us too, which we know most stores don’t tackle. Automations, winback campaigns, retargeting, thank you follow-ups, etc, not only help drive branding but have increased sales dramatically.

Connections are huge in this game as well. We’re lucky to have friends that can run our ads for cheap, do massive press releases for free, and that we can handle a lot of the marketing ourselves because of our expertise. Build connections, utilize them.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

On everything we do, we try to keep our profit margin at around 30% or more. Our biggest aim right now is to lower production costs as well as lead time so that we can go bigger with our marketing while knowing that we can deliver more blankets, profitably.

We don’t see the need for an office yet, or anytime soon, since we are pretty much digital nomads, but we did set up a home office where we both work.



In the coming weeks, we will be fully launched on Amazon, as well as expansion into USA and Canada with their own separate websites.

The long term goal will be to have all of our channels running like a well oiled machine, at which point we will likely be at around $300,000/month (if SEO kicks in properly).

More products, and variation, will lead to higher cart values and an increase in CLTV/repeat purchases.

Brand plays a huge role here as well. As we attack from every angle, we also have a more premium look to our brand, which allows us to demand higher prices and win more customers when people are deciding or comparing us to competitors.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

Lead times (the time it takes from manufacturing to warehouse) completely blindsided us in the beginning. It can be incredibly difficult to estimate when and how many units to order. If it’s too long, you run out of cash to purchase more inventory. So it’s always a delicate balance there.

There’s also a huge amount of luck when it comes to SEO, which is by far the biggest driver for some of our competitors. We’re going full force on that, but it’s just one of those things you can’t fully control.

It also really, really helps to focus on one business at a time. Since we each have our own businesses, this is only something we can focus on for half of the day. FOCUS. Keeping each other accountable has really helped us stay on track.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

* Shopify for ease of use and order management
* Drip for email capture and automation
* Drift for customer emails/chat/targeted messaging
* Ahrefs and Serpfox for SEO
* Beeketing for social proof on the website
* Zapier for many of our connections
* Google Sheets for some advanced tracking
* Xero for accounting
* Scout Abandoned Cart Recovery - great tool that automatically sends you a Messenger bot reminder with options to follow up via phone/SMS/Whatsapp

A lot is also done manually (surprising, I know). If you have the time or money to manage ads and things yourself, you don’t need to rely on too many tools.  

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

I’m not huge into consuming content. I’d rather look for a quick solution on Google when I need an answer.

I follow Gary V for inspiration and Tim Ferriss from back in the day got me on the track to working for myself.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

I mentioned this before but: **FOCUS**.

I see so many people hopping from one idea to the next, or trying to many things at once. If you have a business and want to move on to another idea, make sure your current one has systems in place to flourish without you.

If your current idea isn’t successful, don’t give up until you’ve hustled at it for 4 months straight.

It also helps to have cash. It just makes things move faster and keep the ball rolling quicker. Get a job, save up, get investors.

ecommerce,$50k/month selling Anxiety Reducing Blankets,"Hey - Pat here. I interview young eCommerce businesses to find out how they came up with the product and how they built their business. 

Today's interview is with Aaron and Lior, the founders of Hush Blankets, a brand that makes weighted, anxiety reducing blankets.


**Some stats:**

* Revenue/mo: $50,000
* Started: January 2018
* Location: Toronto, Ontario
* Founders: 2
* Employees: 1

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hey there! We’re two young entrepreneurs from Toronto working hard to control this ""side hustle"" which is rapidly turning into our main business because of it’s fast growth.

Our product, Hush Blankets, is a weighted blanket that when placed on you, helps instantly reduce anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Our customers are mainly people looking to buy this for their spouses that can’t sleep, or as gifts for other family members. Usually women above 40.

We’ve grown fast, averaging 300% month over month growth, rapidly expanding into new ecommerce channels as well.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Who would have thought that a background in the software and restaurant space would lead to a health product. We’ve always been entrepreneurs, both dropping out of university and with the mindset that we can create more for ourselves than school would ever provide us.

The idea for Hush started when my partner, Lior, worked at an overnight camp for special needs children. They had a room there called the ""Stimulation Room"" and it had all sorts of devices and tools that were sensory-related. One of them was a weighted blanket.

&gt; If your current idea isn’t successful, don’t give up until you’ve hustled at it for 4 months straight.

It was so effective that he kept going back there just to try it out. But it was ugly, and he knew it could be improved.

A couple years later, the Hush Blanket was made into a premium product that any adult can enjoy the benefits from, outside of a hospital or rehab centre.

We both have our own businesses, but we also struggle from stress and sleeping from time to time. Once we started trying our own product, we were in love.

We threw up a quick Shopify site and started running pre-orders. Those flooded in, and we knew our first order was going to sell out quick.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

There is only 2-3 main manufacturer players in the market, but really they’re just textile companies that decided to perfect this and niche down. We are currently looking into keeping our options open by actually owning and controlling the entire manufacturing process from start to finish, which will give us the competitive edge.

The trick is designing the product yourself to be superior and one that everyone will rave about. This consisted of late nights deconstructing prototypes, and even buying every competitor’s blanket until we were satisfied with our first version.

I have limited experience in *physical* product design, except the odd t-shirt or product bag for our juice kitchen. In the beginning, we really had to learn from competitors and limited market research with real people trying our prototypes.

We both funded our first production run ourselves (insanely expensive for textiles, super high barrier to entry), with a loan to the company we paid a lawyer to create.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

Shopify was a natural selection because it’s just so great at e-commerce. We only have one product at the moment, so it was easy to choose a theme based around that.

We’re both marketers by trade, SEO and Social Media, so we knew we had that covered. We’re also lucky to be surrounded by very good friends that run our AdWords and Facebook ads.

Everything was financed by us in the beginning. We pretty much poured everything we had into this, took out 3 credit cards and 2 lines of credits with 2 different banks to help with larger purchases along the way too. Over $80,000 spent, 1200 units on the way and we were ready to start rolling.

The first sale was made the very next day after starting AdWords. Since then, every dollar we make we put back towards either inventory or growth through marketing.

We don’t plan on taking a profit for the entire first year, and we know some of our competitors simply can’t afford to do that, so we’re blessed to have our other businesses that allow us to do that.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

Our biggest growth factor has been AdWords for sure. Most people think it is too expensive, but if you have an A+ ads team, and a decently priced product, it can work well with a lot of room to scale.

The reason it works so well is because people are searching for the unique product where they read about it elsewhere online. Their buyer’s intent leads them to clicking our ad and much more likely to convert. Our homepage is setup like a landing/sales page since we only have one product at the moment so that helped with conversions too.

We’re now spending well into 5-figures a month on advertising, with Facebook for retargeting, and massive plans to use it for cold audiences as well. Every 2 weeks we try another paid platform and that seems to fuel growth even more.

We have a campaign that ""farms"" new keywords that are “long tail keywords”. Once we know people buy through those super unique or buyer-intent keywords, they are moved to a winner campaign. The goal is to eventually have a massive campaign with only winner keywords that we bid on.

&gt;Lead times (the time it takes from manufacturing to warehouse) completely blindsided us in the beginning. It can be incredibly difficult to estimate when and how many units to order.

We are going heavy on video production for cold audience with FB traffic, and we even recently hired a salesperson to call our abandoned carts and give them a personal touch of customer service.

As long as it’s profitable (or break-even in some cases), keep doing it. My biggest advice would be to have enough cash and a *really good* advertiser to be willing to test things for 3-4 months before calling it quits.

We also hired a full time instagrammer to just do social media and find us influencers, which we plan to use as a big channel of traffic.

Email has been huge for us too, which we know most stores don’t tackle. Automations, winback campaigns, retargeting, thank you follow-ups, etc, not only help drive branding but have increased sales dramatically.

Connections are huge in this game as well. We’re lucky to have friends that can run our ads for cheap, do massive press releases for free, and that we can handle a lot of the marketing ourselves because of our expertise. Build connections, utilize them.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

On everything we do, we try to keep our profit margin at around 30% or more. Our biggest aim right now is to lower production costs as well as lead time so that we can go bigger with our marketing while knowing that we can deliver more blankets, profitably.

We don’t see the need for an office yet, or anytime soon, since we are pretty much digital nomads, but we did set up a home office where we both work.



In the coming weeks, we will be fully launched on Amazon, as well as expansion into USA and Canada with their own separate websites.

The long term goal will be to have all of our channels running like a well oiled machine, at which point we will likely be at around $300,000/month (if SEO kicks in properly).

More products, and variation, will lead to higher cart values and an increase in CLTV/repeat purchases.

Brand plays a huge role here as well. As we attack from every angle, we also have a more premium look to our brand, which allows us to demand higher prices and win more customers when people are deciding or comparing us to competitors.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

Lead times (the time it takes from manufacturing to warehouse) completely blindsided us in the beginning. It can be incredibly difficult to estimate when and how many units to order. If it’s too long, you run out of cash to purchase more inventory. So it’s always a delicate balance there.

There’s also a huge amount of luck when it comes to SEO, which is by far the biggest driver for some of our competitors. We’re going full force on that, but it’s just one of those things you can’t fully control.

It also really, really helps to focus on one business at a time. Since we each have our own businesses, this is only something we can focus on for half of the day. FOCUS. Keeping each other accountable has really helped us stay on track.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

* Shopify for ease of use and order management
* Drip for email capture and automation
* Drift for customer emails/chat/targeted messaging
* Ahrefs and Serpfox for SEO
* Beeketing for social proof on the website
* Zapier for many of our connections
* Google Sheets for some advanced tracking
* Xero for accounting
* Scout Abandoned Cart Recovery - great tool that automatically sends you a Messenger bot reminder with options to follow up via phone/SMS/Whatsapp

A lot is also done manually (surprising, I know). If you have the time or money to manage ads and things yourself, you don’t need to rely on too many tools.  

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

I’m not huge into consuming content. I’d rather look for a quick solution on Google when I need an answer.

I follow Gary V for inspiration and Tim Ferriss from back in the day got me on the track to working for myself.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

I mentioned this before but: **FOCUS**.

I see so many people hopping from one idea to the next, or trying to many things at once. If you have a business and want to move on to another idea, make sure your current one has systems in place to flourish without you.

If your current idea isn’t successful, don’t give up until you’ve hustled at it for 4 months straight.

It also helps to have cash. It just makes things move faster and keep the ball rolling quicker. Get a job, save up, get investors.",2,6,2018-05-25,ECOM,0.04013852526744207,0.8856530984242758,0.07420837009946506

dropship,My experience and thoughts on drop shipping with ebay - first two weeks,"A little warning this is about a notch higher than a total shitpost so precede with caution.

Just a little more than 2 weeks ago I learned what drop shipping was. After watching a couple of videos on YouTube about drop shipping I figured that ebay drop shipping was the route I would go since it was basically free to start. 

I actually sold something the first day I posted for a $3.00 profit margin. My first instinct was that I was just going to have to repeat the same success 10x a day for an easy extra $210 a week \(granted not a lot of money but for work that took me basically no time to do I was happy with the idea of it\). I posted my max number of listings to hit my monthly sell limit \($800\) with about 15 listing averaging about \~$50 an item in a span of 3 days. 

I knew that some postings had cheaper prices than me but since I was considering this all an experiment in proof of concept I just decided to let it ride and see what happened. Well fast forward to today, since the first sale I have sold exactly one other item which is also the same exact item I sold on my first day for the same profit margin. Most of my listings got anywhere between 20\-50 views with the one item I sold twice breaking over 100 views. 

I decided today to delist all my items and take a hiatus on ebay drop shipping for now. Here is a list of my thoughts on ebay drop shipping:

1. It is very competitive and maybe too competitive for beginners. 
2. As long as people are willing to wait over two weeks for deliveries from China its impossible to exist in the same space as insanely cheap Chinese sellers.
3. Youtubers who promote ebay drop shipping videos are probably not doing as well as they want you to think.
4. My guess is any success to ebay drop shipping comes through bulk listing which takes a long time to get to due to sell limits.

ecommerce,I'm a lost soul.,"Since I was 14 I always wanted some way to make money online. I remember my dad telling me about one of his friends that made a lot of money online and he didn't have to get up in the morning to work plus he seemed like a really happy person (more than my father who used to work 12 hours almost every day). I found that extremely interesting and I guess since then I developed this interest. Anyway, I'm also pretty good when it comes to school and I've had lots of teachers telling me I should be this and that but I was never interested in any of it. Like I said, since I was 14, I developed this interest. It was like my whole world view changed.

Throughout all these years I've had the interest come and go and when I went to look for guidance, I found myself overwhelmed with information and people saying it is too competitive and that everything is taken now. Then there's people claiming that there's only one good way to do it and I ended up with a lot of confusion about it which made me take a break from it because I was getting nowhere and I had to focus on other parts of my life. 

I'm trying again, hoping that I'll at least get a tiny bit of advice but, where should I start? Should I get into a college and study something such as marketing? I just need some guidance on where to learn from. I'm considering starting a Shopify store, find good products, and advertise through Facebook but I'm considering to push it back for a few months because, like I said, I'm really lost and it's not good to be lost when dealing with all of this.

I had a very large order come through the website.

Fair enough if that is the case(which I strongly believe it is not). If the dude had his card taken then the bank should cover that loss as their system allowed the fraudulent transaction. 

BUT, I'm not a thief, and I didn't do anything wrong, so how come it is me that loses big time, both all the items I sent, and now the total order cost plus extra stripe fees too?

shopify,adwords - no conversions,"First of all let me be clear, I'm not expecting to make money in first couple of months - but won't lie, would be cool if I could buy Koenigsegg in my first decade :D  - tbh i don't even know if it's realistic to scale up that business model to 1m profit a year

I need someone to tell me where did I go wrong? I'm starting to think that I really fucked up at the very start - product selection..


all i really care about  is to stay at breakeven, for now i'm even failing to do that.. with $35 at 0.90CPC on avg. I still have yet to see my first sale at $10 budget a day

That's how much I've spent so far on campaign, including the initial phase of ad testing

I ran through liike 5 ad copies, couple of keywords (broad mod. phrase, exact), negative keywords, countless extensions - including sitelinks, use of numbers, %s, $s, capitalizing every letter - trying to make my ad copies look good and relevant

I got rid of the biggest cash sink - that was ""moon lamp' - phrase, around $16 on queries unrelevant to my ad, but thanks to that i've located 2 potential keywords with really good CTR

My quality score on ads is at 7/10, one is at 8/10 - I could potentially bring all of my keywords to 8/10 if I assigned 1 keyword to each ad copy, also my ad rankings are going up

I don't know.. I really do think I made a good job with optimization, today was supposed to be that ""big day"" when I get my first sale finally - I got rid of all useless keywords, narrowed it down to the most specific ones and even with only 3 keywords - one of them was [moon lamp] - I blazed through my daily budget with not a single conversion.. after that I narrowed it down to just one 8/10 tag 

bid strategy is set to manual

i don't know anymore where the problem lies.. I thought if my page looks somewhat ok, as long as i get clicks, i should have conversions to at least keep me at breakeven..

 is it that damn product? price? my ads? or perhaps landing page? maybe I'm bidding too low (max $1.10) - for example on [moon light] i was ranking 2nd.. i just cant knock down established 1st positioner.. his ad outranks me almost 100% of the time

also I'm having hard time determining when to kill the product.. and I already have another one on my radar. around half of cpc cost, not as much traffic

for the past couple of days I spent 95% of my free time on adwords - and tbh i kinda like it, tinkering with ads is fun - it's like gambing - you never know when you hit the score",13,4,2018-05-30,ECOM,0.05201689526438713,0.9179908037185669,0.029992349445819855

With that in mind... does anyone have a good recommendation on vendors/suppliers that provide high\-quality foam inserts with velvet flocking? [See this link for an example](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1iE5YaLNNTKJjSspeq6ySwpXav/Die-Cut-Dark-Velvet-Flocking-Foam-Insert.jpg_350x350.jpg)

Hoping to have custom die cutouts to take shape of the products and Google is only showing me so many results.   


Thank you in advance for any guidance! It is much appreciated.",1,2,2018-05-31,ECOM,0.011611012741923332,0.8124921917915344,0.1758967936038971
