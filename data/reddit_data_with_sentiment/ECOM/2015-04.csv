I am concerned about optimising CRO with basic on site info. Currently I am concerned with a) minimal social proof b) lack of reviews on new gear c) any possible negative effect of there being no 'human' faces on the store d) lack of interesting about us page.

Do you think I am correct in being concerned with those things? What would you change about this store if you ran it? I am starting to run FB ads which means I am more sensitive to those elements. Considering that they are harder to convert 'cold' leads.

Building traffic is going to be quite hard because the product is so niche any ideas on how do this would be greatly appreciated. Currently I am planning on using instagram and blogger outreach with a general focus on social media above all. The business did quite well in the past year for a start up - people love (or hate) our product so I am just scaling.

ecommerce,Bigcommerce goes into its 3nd day of system failures causing client checkout to be unavailable,"Taken from status.bigcommerce.com


Update - Bigcommerce engineers have been very pro-active in working with our storage provider, IBM Softlayer, in finding solutions. Unfortunately, it takes two parties to come to a solution. In this case, IBM Softlayer intentionally let their Object Storage cluster fall into disrepair and chose not to scale it. This has impacted Bigcommerce, IBM and many other Softlayer customers. 

Our engineers placed too much trust in IBM Softlayer and that's on us. However, the catastrophic failures to see metrics and rapidly scale capacity, the decisions to let hard drives sit at 90% utilization for weeks and months, the cascading failures of an undersized cluster of 52 nodes for the busiest data center in their business speaks to IBM Softlayer’s lack of concern for their customers. We found this out 3 days ago. 

We should have pressed more and held them to the fire; for that, we are sorry. I'm the head of Technical Operations and this pains me, because of the high uptime and reliability our engineering teams have built in the past year. Unfortunately, our trust in IBM Softlayer was misplaced. They have failed at every level of an operations team, they have failed as a business unit, they have failed in caring about how their customers are affected. 

We care deeply about our customers and have been trying to work around Softlayer’s bad decisions. We are at the point where we feel we needed to say, ""This isn't us; this isn't how we think about high availability."" 

We are already planning and working toward how we will move off Softlayer Object Storage and better plan for a single vendor failing, no matter how well regarded it is. Our best information at this time is that no data loss has occurred, and we are working around the clock to ensure that remains the case. 

I take this personally. I've crafted highly available solutions at Apple, Digg, Eventbrite and now, Bigcommerce. When the site isn't performing, I get angry. And, like the Hulk, no one wants to see me angry. I am fighting for all of you and will continue to do so.

Update - Bigcommerce Systems Engineers have been alerted that current situation with storefronts has recently degraded. We are continuing to work with our storage provider to come to a solution. We will update as we have information. 
Apr 3, 20:26 CDT
Update - Performance issues with our storage provider continue but some code changes have provided some improvement in response times and decreased error rates. We have had reports that performance issues have been severe enough on some sites to appear as though the store is unavailable. We apologize for that and are still trying to find ways to lessen the impact from our storage provider's issues. 
Apr 3, 15:52 CDT
Update - Bigcommerce engineers have implemented a few changes to help with performance while our storage provider continues to work on bringing their performance back to acceptable levels. Response times have improved slightly with few errors. Our engineers are continuing to test and implement workarounds in response to our storage provider's issues. 
Apr 3, 12:22 CDT
Update - After a quiet 8 hours, our storage provider is suddenly experiencing higher load and 3 times the worst error rate we've measured. We are waiting for updates on when this will stabilize. Our apologies again for this situation. 

Bigcommerce engineers started testing a solution to move all Bigcommerce data to a new storage cluster. We'll update as we finish testing and start to move to the new solution. 
Apr 3, 08:37 CDT
Update - Bigcommerce engineers are still working on new solutions to the issues with our storage provider. We will update status as we receive test results or updates from the provider. 
Apr 2, 21:49 CDT
Update - Bigcommerce engineers have eliminated some errors but are still testing further solutions to fix all the errors. Thanks again for your patience. 
Apr 2, 17:54 CDT
Update - The storage provider is still experiencing heavy load. Bigcommerce engineers are investigating solutions to work around the storage provider's issues. We are hoping to update on the results of testing these solutions soon. 
Apr 2, 16:47 CDT
Update - Our storage provider has made us aware of several hard drive failures in their storage clusters where we keep storefront resources such as images and other template files. This is causing intermittent availability of these resources. At this time, we have no reason to believe there has been data loss. The storage provider has all hands on deck working to restore the service to full performance. We will provide further updates as they are available. 
Apr 2, 15:02 CDT
Update - Work continues with our storage vendor to find a resolution. Updates will be made as more information becomes available. 
Apr 2, 12:22 CDT
Update - We are continuing to work with our storage provider on a resolution to this issue. 
Apr 2, 09:49 CDT
Identified - Bigcommerce engineers have identified a problem with the storage service for WebDAV. Due to issues with their system, some files are being cached as existing but having no data, resulting in intermittent availability of these files. We are working with them to correct this issue. Please do not edit affected files in WebDAV until we are able to restore their availability, as changing the files may cause them to become unrecoverable. We will be updating as we get more information from our storage provider.

shopify,[New to Shopify] Is it possible to have multiple people buy-in on a single item?,"Hi everyone,

My family own's a business selling free-range meats to local markets. I'm wanting to expand upon that and start a website where people can order for pick-up at one of our stalls.

One thing a lot of families do is pitch-in to buy an entire animal and have it split among them. One idea I've had to go about doing this would be to create a one-time use category page that lists all the cuts of meats which they could share with friends and family. something like: http://mystore.com/cow?123dfwevsdfewgt. Once the category is sold out we can process the order and delete the custom category.

ecommerce,Interested in a loyalty and rewards platform for your online store designed to increase repeat customers and total spend?,"Hey!

I am the founder of a company called ChainPerks and we are building a platform for small business owners to ""plug-n-play"" a loyalty and rewards program into their stores. We were accepted into a startup accelerator a few months ago and have been building fast as we can since then.

We originally started out supporting only merchants who accept bitcoin but have now broadened the scope of the project to incorporate any small business. Currently building out the shopify plugin and was looking for two store owners that would be interested in trying out the platform.

We currently support two main campaign types (spend based and transaction based). A spend based campaign would let you say to your customers ""Once you spend $X at my store you earn a $Y reward"" and a transaction based campaign says ""When you make X transactions you get a $Y reward"".

There are lots of campaign types in the work but these are the most common. We are also developing a few campaigns that utilize the bitcoin blockchain to offer things never before possible.

Anyway, you can check out the current homepage (https://www.chainperks.com) if you like but it is still 100% focused on bitcoin merchants so ignore some of the messaging. We have not yet updated it to reflect our broadening to all merchants.

Would LOVE to hear your guys thoughts, questions, and feedback on the platform.

Please PM me if you want to be one of the two stores that will get early access to the platform. I will personally help you get setup and run your first campaign!

ecommerce,Ecommerce and print media marketing? Not as strange as it sounds,"Ecommerce companies are now turning to print media to boost visibility
Statistics suggest a dim future for print media with declining advertising revenues globally. Newspapers have in turn responded by moving to an online version to reduce costs and retain ad revenue. In contrast, ecommerce companies who previously had a purely digital presence are taking to print media in an attempt to create a more tangible presence. They are doing this not just by taking out print ads, but also by coming out with physical catalogues for people to browse through.
Targeting end consumers through print media is a cost intensive process, given the large consumer base. Ecommerce companies are, howeverinnovatively overcomingit. Few online B2C fashion stores for example create magazines that contain their catalog and sell it to customers for a price. For B2B firms, the costs are lesser as they usually have a reasonably good idea of their customers, enabling more targeted campaigns. Also, the revenue gained from an additional customer in theB2B context is potentially far more than for a B2C Company, which means that B2B firms are better placed to cover their printing costs in the long run. It’s not just catalogs; ecommercesites are also taking to advertisements in newspapers and magazines to cement their presence in people’s minds.
But print is still more expensive than digital, therefore raising questions on its feasibility. The objective of a marketing campaign is to give exposure from as many directions as possible and ensure customer recall of the brand. Formany ecommerce companies with a good online presence, print media maybe the missing link in their marketing campaign. Print media enables you to literally put your company in people’s hands,making it far more personal.
Ads taken out in niche magazines and newspapers can provide access to the right type of audience. Ads on the net compete for attention but print ads are usually well spaced out with high visibility. This sentiment is often shared by the more traditional minds in your customer’s organization.  
Print media has managed to keep its naysayers at bay. Despite its reduced popularity, print media advertising revenues are still much larger than online revenues. Print isn’t going to go away any time soon and B2B businesses should not neglect including it in their marketing campaigns.

dropship,17.y.o keen to start drop shipping on eBay,"Hello there, 
As the title suggests, I'm 17 years old and I've always been keen to start some sort of small business. I've decided that an eBay business interests me the most and could be manageable given I'm still at school 5 days a week. I've always been into the ""buy low, sell high"" concept for example, I used to buy watches off aliexpress for very cheap prices and sell them to people at school and online which made me about a grand within a month. With this money I'd like to try out eBay and I was thinking that dropshipping could be a good place to start but I'm not sure where to buy from? Is the amazon to eBay method a good starting point? Would love any tips or stories from anyone that could help me! Anything is appreciated.

ecommerce,Partnering up with a tailor for shirt idea. Would appreciate advice (crosspost from /r/entrepreneur),"Hi,

A couple of weeks ago I was looking to purchase a shirt (not a t-shirt) I have seen on a character in a movie, but alas, after many hours of googling I could only find one rather poor remake priced at 150 USD. (And a lot of DIY or requests for this shirt)

I therefore went to my local tailor to have it made, and one thing led to another, and now he is in the process of making a sample free of charge for me. If it turns out nice I thought I would have 15-20 made in China and open up a shop on Shopify. Now to my questions:

1. How to best check if there is a marked for this design  
2. The tailor wants to go into business with me, but as I will be doing all the ""heavy lifting"" after the initial design is up and running, what could be a viable consortium setup? (He will also help me get the shirt produced in China as well, and I might want him on future shirt projects if this works out)  
3. I have read up on copyright and trademark law, and as far as I understood I am in the clear if I avoid logos and don't blatantly market it with photos etc. from the movie. Is this correct? (Nor is the shirt made of a licensed fabric design)  

Grateful for any ideas. Thanks.",10,4,2015-04-10,ECOM,0.01788998767733574,0.9118394255638123,0.0702705830335617

woocommerce,Help: Complex product configuration in WooCommerce,"Never posted here before, so I hope this post isn't breaking any rules. I can't include a System Status Report because this is a preemptive question.

I’m working on a WooCommerce site, and while I have plenty of WP experience, I can’t say the same for WooCommerce.

The site is a sheet music store. Each product is a separate piece of music, and they need to be able to be configured in the following ways:

* Some pieces will have multiple editions, e.g. one version with a shorter duration. The different editions have different starting prices. There can be up to 50 different editions for a single piece.
* Each edition of each piece must have its own Year, Duration, and Grade attribute.
* When an edition of a product is selected, the user will be taken to a configuration screen to make further customizations.
* The configuration screen must allow the user to pick and choose between different parts of the composition: Piccolo, Flute, etc. Each of these parts must also allow selection between a PDF, a physical copy, or both.

As you can see, there are a ton of different options to support. The WooCommerce documentation talks about product attributes and variations, but it’s all for simple customizations like shirt colors – nothing approaching this level of customization. After doing some research, it seems like I’ll need to use the Gravity Forms addon or something similar, but I’m really not sure.

Does anyone know how I can achieve this level of customizability using WooCommerce?",4,3,2015-04-10,ECOM,0.03393871709704399,0.939264714717865,0.026796512305736542

ecommerce,Shopping Cart Elite Spammers Permabanned from Sub,"Today I banned 6 users from the sub in what looks like a pretty clever reddit-wide spamming for the service Shopping Cart Elite.  It looks like all the users registered for accounts around the same time (about 2 weeks ago), would post legit-looking questions, then hop on other accounts to give answers that pushed toward their service.  They did this in multiple subs repeatedly.  

There may be more that I haven't seen on here, but I tried to root them all out.  If you visited their site or investigated their service, you might want to beware as this isn't a typical tactic of legit and established services; it usually backfires on them as it has here.

EDIT - I messaged the mods of other subs where this was happening and we have already found 2 more - total is 8 now... Maybe we can break double digits!

EDIT - 2 more.  As other mods are responding we are finding more.  This is a pretty big scam going here, they are in about 10 subreddits so far it looks like. 

EDIT - The total is up to 16 accounts involved in this so far.  Thanks to mods in other subs for helping with this and letting me know when they find someone associated with it. 

EDIT - They are now posting with different, newer accounts - 28 so far have been found and banned.  Reddit admins have been asked for help with this.

I am wondering if its ok to build my shop so you can only have one address and edit it. Is there a reason why the customer has to be able to create multiple addresses?

-----------------------------------------------
customers/order.liquid
https://docs.shopify.com/themes/theme-development/templates/customers-order

The requirements state:
- Show both the billing and shipping addresses of the order

Since shipping is irrelevant for a shop that sells digital goods I was wondering if shipping can be omitted from this theme. Are there any consequences to the checkout process in doing so?

-----------------------------------------------
customers/account.liquid
https://docs.shopify.com/themes/theme-development/templates/customers-account

The requirements state:
- Include a link to the address page

Since I am trying to have a single address for my customers, I was wondering if I can include a link to let the user create/edit his address.


Hope this makes sense. Thank for reading.",5,2,2015-04-15,ECOM,0.046866122633218765,0.9280291795730591,0.025104695931077003

1. Alibaba, states that you must have a registered business name, yet when i look around, some people say that it is pointless registering as an ""unlimited company"", so how can i get around this ? Should i just use my ebay name that i go by ?

2. If i go down that route, companies like amazon fba want a business number, given by registering a business, yet people say there is no need to register. I am just generally confused in this area, any advice ?

3. Are sourcing companies better than sourcing it yourself ? I hear that they have better connections with people over in china, knocking down prices. Thoughts ?

woocommerce,"New to woocommerce, Could use some help with organization and custom products.","So I have watched a couple tutorials and get the basic jist of WooCommerce but I'm making a site for someone who wants a complicated (in my opinion) filtering and categorization system and I was hoping someone would be able to help. 


So this is his current [website](http://cartwrightscreations.com) which is made in wix. I just started working on his new site and am using the [WooPress theme](http://themeforest.net/item/woopress-responsive-ecommerce-wordpress-theme/9751050)


He makes wooden pens and laser engraves other wooden items. What makes this kind of difficult for me to organize is that he uses wood from historical locations and wants you to be able to choose the wood, style, and color of the metal accents of the pen. 


So I bought the [Composite Products](http://www.woothemes.com/products/composite-products/) plugin because I thought it would do what I need.  (And it may, I just don't know how to use it properly) I also bought the [WooCommerce Product Filter](http://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-product-filter/8514038) plugin but yet again I'm not really sure how to implement everything.

I have 3 main pages for the shop as of right now.

-Products (That are in stock)

-Custom Products

-Custom Historical Products


The main products page will just simply be categorized by the type of object and style of pen. I don't plan on making it too complicated because if they want a pen from a specific county they can use the custom historical pens page.


I made a normal custom products for people who don't care about where the wood came from, but just want to create a custom item.


So for the custom page the order of ""building the pen"" would be to:

-Choose the style

-Choose the wood

-Choose the accent

-and possibly upload a file to be engraved? (Please let me know if there is a plugin for this)


For the historical product it would be a little more complicated. The hierarchy would be:

-Choose County

-Choose type of wood from county

-Choose accents

-and maybe upload a file to be engraved? 


I'd really appreciate any insight on how to achieve this as I haven't found any tutorials pertaining to a similar setup.",0,2,2015-04-16,ECOM,0.02457033284008503,0.9389310479164124,0.03649865835905075

We have a drop down menu with a few choices at the very end of the checkout page. If it appears that users fill out the checkout form completely and then abandon it, then that may mean they dislike the available options.

woocommerce,Question to other sellers: What plugins are worth the buy?,"I am attempting to transition my online store from Amazon web hosting to WooCommerce and I'm shopping around for plugins/extensions that provide store automation. I see that woothemes has packaged their extensions in such a way that you need to pay for a license for every little thing i.e. exporting/importing products in csv, downloading customer order reports, making packing slips, and other items which I feel should all come in the same package... The total cost for all of these licenses is looking to be quite expensive, so I see other third-party plugins like Smart Manager which is a fraction of the price and provides a huge array of features that woothemes would otherwise charge individually. My question then is to those who have already shopped around and bought plugins: Which plugin do you feel is the best bang for your buck in terms of the above mentioned features and are there other plugins you would recommend as being worth the money to buy? 

I've played around with some free plugins, but the documentation and support is lackluster and they run into the same problem of only having 1 feature per plugin so I need to shop around and look for multiple plugins that are the best fit while making sure I don't run into compatibility issues, I'm fine with paying the cost of a plugin that just provides me with all of this and would love to hear your thoughts on what you feel is the best fit.

We're using Wordpress for its CMS capabilities and easy themeing and had a discussion with our developer about his thoughts on the strengths/weaknesses of various ecommerce platforms.

So, his brief overview of the situation is that woocommerce is good at selling items (books, shoes, etc...) but not a 'membership' which is all we're selling. 

I'd welcome any thoughts about Woo's capabilities for doing the above, if the capability is native or if plugins are required and any additional thoughts (like non-Woocommerce recommendations) are welcomed.  

Some thoughts on the capabilities we'd want:
1) Sell membership.
2) Standard welcome message with login information that ties to password system.
3) Manage timing of annual membership renewal/communications that ""you need to purchase a year 2 membership"".
4) Turning off access if they don't renew by Day 366.
5) Reporting (financial, membership levels, etc...)
6) PCI Level 1

ecommerce,Great deals &amp; Great discounts,"The Swat Striker Tactical Pro Gear Kit is just loaded with features, accessories, and utility. First of all, this flashlight utilizes an extremely bright 10W Cree XML U2 LED. What does that all mean, I don't exactly know, but it's a powerful 600 Lumens. The beam is so intense, there's even a warning on the box not to stare directly into it.

The light has an adjustable focus ring for flood and spotlight beams, and this advanced flashlight has 5 modes of output. High, Medium, and Low Intensity, Strobe, and an SOS Emergency setting.

The coolest part about this set is the set of color filters that simply attach to the end of the flashlight for all kinds of uses. Ruby light filters don't disrupt night vision goggles or scare game away - perfect for checking maps or star charts at night. Amber light filters reduce glare from fog, smoke, or dust particles. Sapphire lenses are used by hunters to track bleeding game at night, since it highlights bodily fluids. Emerald light filters help for night settings by making a high-contrast light for navigating the woods. 

Oh, and why is it called the Swat Striker? There's a removable glass breaker at the end for emergencies. 

KIT INCLUDES:
- 6"" Swat Striker Flashlight
- Rechargeable 3.7V Li-Ion Battery
- Wall Charger
- Detachable Pocket/Belt Clip
- Wrist Strap
- Removable Glass Breaker

ecommerce,Great discounts &amp; deals,"The Chilly Towel is an amazing towel scientifically designed to keep you cool on even the hottest days! The secret is in the super-absorbent shammy-like weave and hyper-evaporating material that cools off as the towel naturally dries. Endure the heat, and stay cool! 

To use, simply soak or wet the towel with any temperature water, wring it dry and shake it! As it evaporates, the towel drops in temperature, getting downright cold! It can be reused over and over again; just re-wet to start the process. Cooling time lasts for a few hours, so it's better than using a wet rag, towel, or bandana - AND it's dry to the touch! 

It comes in a plastic container that keep your Chilly Towel moist and cool when you need it. To clean, hand wash it with a little soap and water or throw in the machine (let it air-dry). 

FEATURES
- 27""x18""
- Super-Absorbant Material Stays Dry
- Hyper-Evaporative Properties Make It Cool
- Just Soak, Wring, Shake

ecommerce,"First week live, Zero sales. Advice wanted. Help me, Reddit!","I recently made the jump from eBay to Shopify.  I still have my eBay store running, with an average of 10-15 orders per week.  I have been running my eBay gig very part time as an accessory to my brick-and-mortar arborist supply store, so I haven't honestly had too much time to learn a lot about SEO and online marketing.  It doesn't really come naturally to me, but I'm more than willing to learn.  I have done a lot of reading but it doesn't quite click.  I am a very technical person, so understanding the emotional/content/design aspects of running an online store comes more slowly to me. *tl;dr*: I could use a little hand-holding on marketing.

As stated, we have been up for a little over a week, and have had zero sales.  I set up an adwords account, and have had ~100 visitors over the week.  I am bleeding money through adwords, but one sale will cover my weekly advertising budget.  I also set up a Google Merchant Center account, but had to do some updates to reach compliance there.  *tl;dr:* I have some advertising, but it doesn't seem to be resulting in any conversions.

Basically, I was hoping for some advice.

First:  Glaring errors on my site.  Looking to fix the heavy offenses first before moving to tweaking details and any kind of split testing or anything crazy like that.  I want to make sure my foundation is good.

Second: After that, what kind of things can I do to improve navigation?  Are my listings to verbose?  Not verbose enough?  Do I need more details?  What kinds of listing-related advice would you give?

Third: Design/graphics.  I chose the color palette based on a logo I like and purchased a while ago, but I'm not married to it.  Does the design work?  Are the colors obnoxious?  I do think it could use a little more color and structure, but I am not sure what direction to take.

Thanks in advance for your advice.

Most TVs don't feature a built-in antenna anymore. In order to get the free, over-the-air channels, you'll need an external antenna. You can even get some of your favorite HD channels and take advantage of your beautiful high-resolution screen! 

This flat panel antenna has multiple different mounting options. Once you're all plugged into with the coax cable, have your TV start scanning for all the nearby available channels - including High-Definition ones. 

Please Note: Signal strength and availability may vary due to many things like position/angle of your antenna or broadcast towers. HD content can only be delivered to HD television sets.

Most flat screen TVs made within the last 10 years have built-in digital tuners. You can verify this by checking the instruction manual and looking for the word ""ATSC"". If your TV says ""HD Ready"", it means that it does not contain a digital tuner, but is capable of receiving HD content. To utilize this antenna, you may have to purchase a digital converter box for older TV sets..

ecommerce,Importance of Ecommerce for business,"Sitting around the conference table this morning, our team was discussing the most credible e-commerce marketplace, in terms of its payment security, diverse product range, timely delivery, customer service, return policies, logistics, etc. The discussion went on for a couple of hours, but took us to the e-commerce ecosystem, and how it had evolved to the stature it has acquired today.
 
Do you have any memory of a Geeta’s Boutique, Hariom Fashions, See Clearly Eyewear, Lalji Kiranawala, and the other shops you used to frequent earlier? Physical shopping seems like it has become a distant reality. When was the last time you walked into a shop to buy apparel, accessories and other collection, glares and glasses, grocery, or any other home or office basics? Long time, right?
 
That’s what I’m talking about. I hardly have any memory whatsoever of what shopping felt like, before e-commerce came into being. A world without flipkart, amazon, myntra, snapdeal, ebay, shopclues, inkfruit, pepperfry, firstcry, babyoye, junglee, lenskart, almost seems impossible to think of.
 
This is the magic of e-commerce. It has been such a boon to our crazy, busy lifestyle. It has been such a blessing, gifting us with our much needed personal time.
 
But the main question here is, what is e-commerce? Have you ever thought of it as being more about technology, and less about shopping? E-commerce is the result of so many little and big aspects. So today, allow us to introduce you to what it is all about.
 
E-commerce, or electronic commerce, or EC as it fondly called is the simple act of selling and buying of services or goods, or the transfer of data or funds, electronically or through the Internet network. These transfers and transactions can happen between business-to-business (B2B), or business-to-consumer (B2C), or consumer-to-consumer (C2C), or finally between consumer-to-business (C2B).
 
Electronic commerce has its base in technologies such as Internet marketing, mobile commerce, inventory management systems, automated data collection systems, supply chain management, online transaction processing, electronic funds transfer, and electronic data interchange (EDI).
 
Here is a brief history:
·         In 1971 or ‘72: The ARPANET is made use of to accommodate a sale between students of Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the MIT in the US.

·         1979: M. Aldrich gives the first demonstration of online shopping system.

·         1981: UK’s Thomson Holidays becomes the first B2B based online shopping system.

·         1984: Tesco/Gateshead SIS becomes the 1st B2C online shopping system, and Mrs Snowball was the first online home shopper.

 
And then…
·         1995: Amazon.com is launched and eBay is founded.

·         1996: IndiaMART – India’s first B2B marketplace is established.

·         1999: Alibaba is launched in China.

·         2007: Flipkart was born.

 
And so on…
 
Yes, we have cautiously missed out on many important events in the life of e-commerce. But that is because, if we begin to talk to you about every detail, we’ll have the space for only that.
 
However, some of the business applications of e-commerce are logistics, enterprise content management, cataloging, group-buying, automated online assistant, print on demand, online banking, online tracking, online shopping, newsgroups, electronic tickets, instant messaging, and social networking. Needless to say, this list is also extremely lengthy.
 
E-commerce today involves and includes everything from ordering for products and services digitally to immediate digital and online consumption.
 
That’s all for today. Until next week, take care, keep shopping online. Cheers!

ecommerce,Turning a blog into an ecommerce site,"Hi all,
Question here about a blog that I want to buy. Basically its a blog ive done my dye diligence on that has decent quality traffic and interested in a specifix topic which I think I could monetise and turn into an ecommerce site.

Now I would like to build the site on either woocommerce or something like shopify or similar. And integrate the blog into this at the same domain that thw blog is currently on. 

The thing is the traffic is all organic search and for that reason I do not want to just move the blog over to the new platform as essentially it will change the structure of the address, which means in my mind anyway, it will screw things up with these search engines. 

I asked shopify supoort if I could transfer and they had an app for this,  but said it would change the structure on the shopify platform.

I know I could just have the blog seperate but want to keep it in the same look and feel.

Having said all that I think the blog may actually be wordpress already, so if that is the case can I just put woocommerce on over this and it will keep the blog as is and same structure??

Hopefully ive explained this ok, its hard to type out and im not an IT guy, thanks.",3,3,2015-04-26,ECOM,0.026337264105677605,0.9382352232933044,0.03542758524417877

I'm trying to put css into each of my product's Product Description text area in order to control which items from the product.liquid template are visible on each product page.

ecommerce,COLOR CHANGING 9.5IN CERAMIC PAN,"http://imgur.com/VMdfLEP

The amazing color-changing ceramic pan is like kitchen magic. At room temperature, it looks like an ordinary green sauté pan. But as the temperature rises on a hot stove, watch the color disappear and change to white right before your eyes!

After hitting the perfect temperature, you're ready to cook with this quality non-stick ceramic pan. It features a stainless steel induction base for cooking on nearly every surface. That includes gas, electric, induction, and ceramic glass cooktops. 

Better and safer than Teflon, foods slide off the ceramic almost effortlessly making cooking easier and clean up fast and easy. We recommend you use plastic, rubber or wooden utensils with this pan to avoid chipping, but you will never have to worry about metal flaking off like a Teflon pan. 

The stay-cool, ergonomic handle is made of a durable plastic, but the pan is not oven-safe. To prevent burns and protect the color-changing properties of the pan, the manufacturer recommends cooking temperatures less than 220 degrees.

FEATURES:
- Color Changing 9.5in Ceramic Pan
- Goes from green (cold) to white (hot)
- Cook your food properly
- Foods slide off the non-stick surface 
- No need to use unhealthy oils 
- Stainless steel induction base
- PFOA-Free
- Stay-cool ergonomic handle
- Safe for induction, gas, electric, ceramic glass cooktops",0,1,2015-04-29,ECOM,0.03171548619866371,0.9319588541984558,0.03632572665810585
ecommerce,I LOVE YOU TO MOON AND BACK NECKLACE,"We all have someone special in our life... whether it be a significant other, a mom or even a sibling. We don't always express our love like we should. Here's a simple way to say ""I Love You"" that will mean so much to the person you are giving it to. This ""I Love You To The Moon and Back"" Necklace is one of the most unique on the market. 

Featuring a crescent moon, resting inside is a heart that says ""I Love You"" and then the message continues onto the Crescent Moon saying... ""To The Moon and Back"". 

This Two Piece Pendant Necklace is a wonderful gift for any woman and packed with a whole lot of meaning. To say the person you give this to will be ""over the moon"" is certainly a pun, but also true. 

Plain and simple, sometimes it's hard to quantify just how much you love someone - but telling them ""I love you to the moon and back"" is a pretty good place to start! 

FEATURES:
- Overall Pendant size: Length: 1"" x Width: .75""
- Heart size: Length: .75"" x Width: .75""

ecommerce,How can I provide physical gift cards for my online store?,"I've been throwing around ideas for a couple small online stores that would need to have physical gift cards shipped to customers. I've selected possible dropshippers for the products and I can easily build the site and setup an ecommerce platform but I'm not really sure how to go about providing gift cards.

Searching this sub I found someone suggested I could setup my own printer for under ~$100, but that's not really my ideal solution as I would prefer not to do it manually, and I'd still need to figure out how to implement it as a payment.

I also found ZenCards, a service still under construction that will send them out for a $3 flat rate. Their cards aren't shaped like gift cards and I wonder if they could be confused for fliers. But they're not available yet anyway.

So then what options do I have and how might it affect my choice of ecommerce platform and/or payment gateway? Thanks.",3,7,2015-04-30,ECOM,0.027738986536860466,0.9299299716949463,0.04233110323548317

Im currently doing some product research, using terapeak with amazon/ebay.com to find products. The only dilemma is that i live in the UK.

My question is, would it be better to use the .co.uk websites to find items that are successful in my country, or find items which are successful in america and bring the to the UK. 

For instance, i have found an item that is doing well in the US, but no one is selling this item in the UK
