If this is your first time seeing one of my posts:

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I'm Tom. I create free guides. This time I have made one on Facebook ads targeting.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes - It's completely free.

No - I don't want your email address.

&amp;#x200B;

I make guides on google docs, so you don’t have to download anything if you don’t want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I make these guides each time I create a new YouTube video. It’s difficult to grow on YouTube, so I’m hustling to give people as much value as possible. If these help you at all, consider subscribing because I will be creating more docs just like these 🙂

ecommerce,Looking for an ecommerce solution for a small business,"Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a free ecommerce platform for a small craft business. I tried Big Cartel but I wasn't able to customize the shipping prices much at all. They locked me into set amounts per country and that just doesn't work for any kind of accurate shipping calculation at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the things I'm looking for in an ecommerce platform are:

\- Accurate shipping calculations (preferably Canada Post if possible)

\- Maybe some ability to edit CSS

\- Free or inexpensive

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very familiar with Shopify and WooCommerce, but for this it's not in the cards. With Shopify's $30/m price point and the amount of work it takes to set up a decent WooCommerce store in Wordpress it just wouldn't make sense for a craft website that won't be pulling in much revenue.

shopify,Reminder: You do not need loads of capital to be successful in shopify dropshipping.,"Shopify provides us with a golden opportunity to make a living regardless of who we are. I too often see people asking if they need to buy mentorships and web designs for thousands. Simply put: NO! You can self learn through Youtube videos, books, blogs, and reddit posts! You learn from experience, so get to testing. Come up with a solid niche, and target the \*\*\*\* out of it! Run ads that you see successful, and repeat until you have found your golden combo. Then scale! It seems so simple in my mind, then I see others completely blow through savings.

&amp;#x200B;

To put this into retrospect. You should be able to have a shopify site done proficiently in under 3 days, with apps hooked up. Ad content should take a few days if that, and find influencers/ad markets! I have done this process hundreds of times and have had a few hit stores to make it worth. I am *17 years old* and this process has made it remarkably easy!

Story: Have had this clothing site for about 3 years now, its half dropshipping, half product on hand. I might get 3-5 sales a month. Enough to barley break even with shopify. I don't advertise or anything, all natural traffic. Most of my sales come from one jacket that i dropship.

What I have planned: Probably going to sell the clothes in bulk on eBay (Got them all on fashiongo from usa sellers, not super cheap china stuff). Then Im thinking to switching to something where I can just sell that one jacket and keep my domain name.

Should I just try to sell the whole site on flippa? Might be able to get a couple hundred for it. But I really want to keep my domain name. What site should i use to try to sell that one jacket? Thoughts?   Thanks for reading!

ecommerce,Declined Cards - Payment Gateway,"Hey Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I run an eCommerce store, I process mainly US and Canadian cards, sometimes international.

When it comes to Canadian cards they are 99.9% accepted, I don't think Canadians really use prepaid cards and have a real credit card or a bank card with credit card capabilities, therefore no weird issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Whereas when I process US cards or people located in the US, a lot of cards are getting declined. Around 15%. And I am thinking is because they are using some form of prepaid card. And I know a lot of prepaid cards you need to register them first, or they lack certain features and/or have extra security. Or is it something else?

&amp;#x200B;

I tried signing up for different gateways that didn't change anything, if anything [authorize.net](https://authorize.net) kept charging me for each failed attempt, and got the same error as before.

&amp;#x200B;

So I tried adding another processor, out of 50 declined transactions this managed to save 1, but I have to pay more monthly fees...

I also added paypal which managed to save 5 out of 50 declined transactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have you guys noticed this? I use both converge (elavon) and braintreepayments (moneris), I am located in Canada. Is it better to open up a merchant account as an American entity? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it shows as ""cross country/international"" purchase therefore more American orders are getting declined due to ""foreign"" order? My gateways/processors are signed up as ecommerce, not retail.

shopify,Small Canadian startup (online retail). Looking for a good accountant. Recommendations? (Cross-posted to /entrepreneur and /personalfinancecanada),"I'm a Canadian who's starting a Shopify store.  I've registered as a sole proprietor.  My intention is to ship to Canada and the US.  I've done my research, gotten the business permits I need and familiarized myself with Canadian (and to a lesser extent, American) tax obligations.  However, I'm worried I may be overlooking or misunderstanding something - especially in light of the recent Wayfair court ruling in the US.  I'm finding myself overwhelmed when it comes to taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like to consult with an accountant.  I can handle the bookkeeping and day-to-day stuff myself.  I just want:

* To double-check that I'm setting things up properly in the first place
* Peace of mind that I haven't overlooked something major that will cause a headache later
* Someone who will file my and my spouse's returns come tax time\*

\*Our returns are very basic and straightforward.  I usually do my taxes myself, but because it's my first year married and I'm starting up this store, I'd prefer to have a professional handle it.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I live in a small town, there aren't many accountants here.  I'm concerned they may not be familiar with Shopify stores, US online sales, tax implications of dropshipping or importing products, etc.  I'd prefer to consult with someone who sees these situations on a regular basis.

ecommerce,How do I prepare for a surge in referral traffic?,"Last week I got lucky. An editor at a large product-promotion website found my video, and wants to remix it and post a referral link. I've done my due diligence to confirm the offer is legit. The website has a combined subscriber base of almost 4 million people in my target market, and their videos seem to get at least a few hundred thousand views within the first week. I expect the video to go live within the next two weeks.    

So that's the good news. Yay! The flipside is that I don't believe my website is optimized to convert, which is why I'm looking for help.    

For background, I founded my company about a year ago, and have been operating an ecommerce store for about six months. For the first couple of months we used Wix, but later switched things up to shopify. We sell personal safety products for both professionals and non-professionals. In the interest of providing a complete picture, our average sale is between $200-$300. In the past seven days we've had about 300 visitors, at least half of whom found us through an influencer's youtube video. Out of those 300, we've had 2 conversions.    

I'm hoping for help in a few specific areas, but would be happy to get any general advice as well.    


1. I'm planning to send people to my shopify storefront when the link goes live. In the last couple of days, I modified the storefront to put more information about the product up-front, with a link to skip directly to the collection for those inclined. This was in response to an e-marketer who advised me to spend more time telling a story when first-timers click the link. Assuming that most of my traffic is going to come from people who just watched a three-minute overview video, is this the right approach?    

2. I want to be sure the influex of traffic isn't going to overwhelm my website. Does anyone have experience with how shopify storefronts react when potentially tens of thousands of people are visiting at the same time?    

3. How aggressive should I be trying to gather email addresses from visitors? I have a basic grasp of the importance of remarketing, but this is an area where I need to learn a lot more. My goal at the end of the day is sales, but I realize that clicks are not necessarily going to equal sales on the first pass.    

4. Any other tips or advice?

dropship,Looking for a drop shipping partner - I've got the product (US Based) and capacity. I just want to add another channel.,"I make and sell personalized/customized wall art (fancy way of saying custom name signs for nurseries, bridal showers, seasonal signs, etc) through a couple of marketplaces right now.   I've considered dedicating some more time to spinning up my own site, external marketing, etc but I'm much happier making sawdust and rolling product out.  Attempting to track down the right ""IG Influencer"" or f\*cking around with FB ads is not how I want to spend my day.    


We are US based and I have the capacity to add another 10-20 orders a day right now.  There are good margins in these products (especially if it's pulled out of the hyper-competitive marketplaces we sell into now and branded with a little more cache).  Pottery Barn has started selling a mid-range version of our product for $149 that has a 5-7 week lead time. We currently sell the same thing for about $80 right now with a 5 day lead time.   We can white label it or if you have an existing customer base/store/product line that fits the niche we can just sell through.  


I'd really like to find a partner that has some experience on their end because I don't really need the hassle for an extra 5 orders a month.  I think this can easily do $10K/week in 90 days, if not more.  I've gone from 0 to 1000 signs in less than 90 days on a single marketplace with zero external marketing.  Someone that knows what they are doing on the marketing end could replicate that easily.  We have a stellar reputation for top notch customer service, quick turnaround and quality product.   


At its core this is a customer service solution/sale.  Sizes, fonts, colors, timeframes, etc all have to be handled quickly and effectively.  There is a lot more to this than just setting up a shopify store, uploading a couple of products and start the FB ads.  But I'm willing to help, co-invest and support to get it launched and running effectively.  


If anyone is interested - drop me a line.  We can exchange emails and take the discussion from there.

* Infinite options app - that assumes that these options are actual products, and that's not the case. I don't intend to sell these individual products separately.  

If there was a way to completely hide these ""options"" and make them non accessible or non buyable as a standalone- that will work too.

ecommerce,Roast my rewritten biography for my About page,"xxxcccrrr - Principal Consultant

For online businesses, the best defense against fraud is a robust pro-active fraud prevention strategy. A strategy that repels any criminal attempt to commit cyber fraud.

Who better to custom design your fraud prevention strategy than a man who spent years circumventing all types of anti-fraud measures?

Who better to protect your business than a once convicted - turned good guy - fraud prevention specialist?

After all, organizations like the FBI and the US Department for Homeland Security hire ex-cyber criminals to help them fight cyber crime. Why shouldn't you?

I'm xxxcccrrr and yes, I'm a former fraudster who finally got caught and convicted. I learned from and practiced with the best. Getting caught was definitely a big wake up call and made me rethink my priorities, and here I am.  After I’ve seen where my choices have led me, I felt like I’m standing at the beginning of a new road.

Over the years I have greatly developed my skills on this subject and it was something I am the best at. It was a burden to carry that knowledge knowing I will never use it. And then a light bulb moment came showing me there are directions to the use of my skills, more precisely there is an opposite direction – my ability to help others prevent themselves from fraud.

I’ll appreciate any feedback you can give.

woocommerce,Suggestions on Alternatives for WooCommerce Plugin Options,"So we bought a plugin for license delivery, and I have contacted the developers about something, but I wanted to get a head start to see what my options may be.

So we sell auth tokens on the site, and it all works perfectly. However, I would like to not have to manually enter certain details of the online store onto the token database for each key sold.

So my idea was to use the Rest API and retrieve the order details for name / email etc., but then I found out that they didn't use a Custom Post Type. so the only real way I could do it (if the developer doesn't do something), is:

1. Directly Query the Database using EF and join the order number with the sale of the token and the post for the WC sale order.
2. Write some custom endpoint with the Rest API to retrieve what I want with a custom function, since they are just flat out writing CRUD commands for the plugin instead of doing CPT's.

So, I am curious as to what everyone might suggest a way to go to retrieve this with as little overhead as possible. I currently am aiming at the EF solution myself, but still curious to what others might think.",0,2,2018-10-08,ECOM,0.03437924012541771,0.9356779456138611,0.029942834749817848

I'm wondering if there is a plugin or a way to do this on the checkout page? 

I do currently have plugins for product add-ons and checkout field editors, but I don't see a way for a ""rush order fee"" to be added based on the date picked. I'm hoping to cut down on customer abuse of the date picker and unreasonable expectations for shipping orders out.

ecommerce,Protection from Chinese sellers?,"I had hell of a night mare from my first orders from China (won't bore you with details, but if you're interested.. let me know.. the story went kinda mini-viral with amazon FBA / ecommerce people. Have a link the blog in bottom if you'd like to read it).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to make a second purchase, and thinking about dealing with Chinese sellers (the crappy ones i met anyway), just gives me the chills. I think the new complexity has to do with the fact that I'm trying to ship to 2 separate locations (US and Thailand).

&amp;#x200B;

First of all.. im still hecka confused about shipping. I read everything about incoterms. But it's confusing. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) I've seen buyers recommending asking the seller to ship with their account b/c they get favorable rates since they ship so often. But how do you protect yourself against seller messing with it? Basically i had the seller choose the shipping. They told me it was going to air.. which turned out to be trucking (it was shipped to Thailand, which is connected to China by land).. and also all kinds of fraudulent shipping / international trade docs... not to mention it was delayed almost 3 weeks. (BTW, it was $315 for 50 kgs via truck.. which im sure I got gauged.) A lot of sellers mentioned that they arrange the shipping.. but how do you get better rate than the ones I see on web? Im getting quoted $800 for air for 50kg.. which is RIDICULOUS. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2) My first order had a ton of problems. Main thing was that a lot of the units (we do consumable hair product), and I totally forgot about putting in protection clauses for deviations of weight. What ""contigencies"" do you use to make sure your product quality is good? Do you use local QA / inspection company? (If so, which?)

&amp;#x200B;

3) Do you use letter of credit? How do you protect yourself? I was thinking I would pay PayPal and eat the paypal fees as insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Do I need a freight forwarding agent if I'm shipping only a few boxes at a time? 24kg boxes, each 58.5cm x 36 cm x 45.54 cm. I've heard DHL air cargo is quite cheap, but don't you need to be a frequent shipper to be qualifying for their rate?",5,12,2018-10-10,ECOM,0.061419978737831116,0.9086287617683411,0.029951276257634163

There aren't many other business that sell the equipment we distribute (NASA and Disney are some of our clients for example). Today I was searching for specs for one of our new cameras and found a Chinese company has completely copied our store. The only difference is they changed the telephone and email address and replaced our logo. You can't buy anything from them but it’s some kind of obvious scam and I'm worried people will contact them thinking they are us after searching for products on google.

woocommerce,Wocommerce Subscriptions - Skip Week and Change Subscription.,"Hello Everyone,

I was hoping to get a bit of insight into how I can achieve some specific functionality for a weekly food subscription service I'm working on. I've spent a fair bit of time reading through the Woocommerce Subscriptions documentation but I'm still not sure if Subscriptions has me completely covered out of the box.

Basically the business operates as follows:

I have 12 different food combinations/ boxes (Varible Products) each available in 3 different variations/ sizes (Single, Couple, and Family). At the initial subscription a user will select the product they like and then choose an appropriate size. Going forward that item and size will be billed and delivered on a weekly basis. As an example, a customer might choose the ""Snacker Box"" in ""Couple Size"" for $19.99 and that will be billed weekly.

As we are dealing with food and a weekly subscription, I want to give the customer some control over their order without having them cancel outright and then resubscripe.

* The first feature I need to include is the ability for a user to to skip a week. This would be useful for vacationing, busy weeks, etc.  

* The second feature I need to include is the ability for a user to change the box they recieve each week. So a user who's bored with the ""Snacker Box"" could switch over to the ""Health Nut Box"".

* The final feature would be to allow the user to change the size of their subscription box. So a user who's previously been on a ""Couple Size"" can upgrade to ""Family Size"" or downgrade to ""Single Size"" depending on there needs.

I'm brand new to Woocommerce Subscriptions (and still a bit of a WooCommerce newb in general) so any advice at all on this would be incredible :)",2,3,2018-10-11,ECOM,0.033102113753557205,0.9358962178230286,0.031001688912510872
dropship,"New tool ranks AliExpress products by GROWTH% instead of total orders, to discover winning products in an early stage (example inside)","**Did you know that it's extremely misleading to look at products sorted by orders on AliExpress?**

The problem is that 'orders' actually means the total orders of the product in the last 6 months. This means that  these products with the most orders are most always saturated already and oversold by many other dropshippers.

That's why I've built a scraper that visits 10's of thousands of products every week. It saves the number of orders for every single one of these products, so my application is able to calculate an important and hidden metric: growth rate. I call it 'Alirank' because the app can rank products by their Alirank - the relative growth within their category.

The value of this is that as a dropshipper you are able to see exactly which products are growing fast, while their total order count is still limited. This means that your competition probably won't find them anytime soon. 

**I'll give you an example (**[**https://ibb.co/mkdjg9**](https://ibb.co/mkdjg9)**)**

In the image attached to this post you'll see the top selling products in the category ""festive and party supplies"". The upper half of the image shows the top products when sorted by orders. All have 10K+ orders. You shouldn't try to sell these products; too much competition and oversold. In the bottom half of the image you'll see the products when they are sorted by Alirank, which indicates how fast they're growing right now. As you can see it surfaces totally different products, with a decent amount of orders and reviews already, but nowhere near the point of saturation.

In short: this unique method of ranking AliExpress products allows you to scout winning products, BEFORE most other dropshippers. You can view the data per category, if you only sell certain categories in your store. Or you can get an overall picture, across categories, of the fastest growing products right now!

You all know that dropshipping success is all about riding the waves of seasons and trends. What if you could spot the tide before everyone else?

dropship,Pay Per Order Custom Packaging Finally! Improve Your Repeat Purchase Rate With No Extra Work!,"Hey Guys,

We offer a tailored, effective and quick Customised Packaging solution to enhance your dropshipping/ecommerce store.

If your supplier includes foreign packaging or foreign receipts in your delivery then your entire business model is at risk.  Poor customer experiences can lead to negative feedback or even worse them becoming single rather than repeat customers.

You’ve heard of custom packaging and how important the unboxing experience is but you’ll need to order packaging with extremely high MOQ’s and prices in order to do that, plus you’ll have to package the items yourself! Not to mention the exceptionally high postage rates you will incur when sending your products to multiple addresses.

That’s where we can offer a cost effective, one stop shop solution to match your business needs.

What if we provided:

Pay-per-order custom packaging branded to your store.

Seasonal packaging

Took the time to take out any Chinese receipts.

Took a photo of your item before sending so returns are protected against.

Provided full tracking details.

Sent out your product in English packaging with English stamps.

Heck, what about a handwritten note directly thanking your customer?

What if you could have this for every product you sold at the touch of a button?

AND what if this only added 2 days to your fulfilment time?

Sounds like a wonderful experience for everyone, right?

Welcome to [https://SimpShip.com](https://simpship.com/)

Here’s why the experts (Shopify) are calling this idea essential: [https://www.shopify.co.uk/guides/shipping-and-fulfillment-101/packaging](https://www.shopify.co.uk/guides/shipping-and-fulfillment-101/packaging)

shopify,"New dropshipping tool ranks AliExpress products by GROWTH% instead of total orders, to discover winning products in an early stage (example inside)","**Did you know that it's extremely misleading to look at products sorted by orders on AliExpress?**

I'm trying to run a multi-vendor marketplace and am looking for the best way to have data submitted on the frontend.   
 structured in a way that allows users to simply login and view their products, orders, bookings, and manage their account from a dropdown menu on the main menu, with single pages for each item.

I'm currently running Woocommerce Product Vendors on the Listify theme, which is almost a direct mirror of the WP dashboard itself but I'm hoping to get away from that as its not very user-friendly or aesthetically pleasing. I need to simplify the way vendors add products (bookable).

Not sure if I have to get someone to custom build it for me or if there's something that exists right out of the box that I can get, but any help or advise would be greatly appreciated.

Just point me in the right direction please!!

ecommerce,Online fashion e-commerce brands are making millions of $$$ and what we need to learn from them for our stores this Christmas,"Hi guys,

I have nothing to sell or promote, I promise. I have been thinking about the final quarter for e-commerce and what types of things we need to do to truly stand out to customers and get sales for Christmas. Some of the best tactics I am currently seeing are from the British online juggernauts like ASOS, BooHoo and Pretty Little Thing. There is something about British fashion brands that just totally get e-commerce in a way that is fresh and unique. For reference, ASOS makes £1.5 billion every year and BooHoo (which owns Pretty Little Thing) makes almost £300m per year. We seriously need to look at what the big boys are doing. 

Here are a few things I have noticed they are doing that we should also be doing: 

* **New arrivals daily:** I know they have millions of dollars to invest in purchasing new stock but I do think having new arrivals daily on your website for your store is the way to go because it creates the fear of missing out. People also by proxy think that you are extremely busy so they better buy. 
* **Aggressive abandoned store cart emails:** Pretty Little Thing really forces abandoned cart emails like no other fashion brand that I have seen. I genuinely wanted to purchase a dress from them a month ago but I got distracted and left the site to do other things. WOW. Those abandoned cart emails were so aggressive but I respect their ability to send them out to get my sale. 
* **Find up and coming influencers:** I remember always getting my fingers burned with influencers for my beauty e-com venture but I realise they are still very relevant and interesting. Pretty Little Thing is connected to tonnes of celebrities as well. I know for a lot of us here paying someoone massive mounds of cash to be an influencer isn't realistic but we need to think about how to find up and comers instead of established influencers. 
* **Boost sales with limited edition lines:** ASOS sent me an email a few weeks ago for their long awaited collection with The Simpsons. I was like ahhhh I need to buy this since I love The Simpsons. By the time I had my credit card ready to buy, the line had sold out. That was one of the best FOMO marketing tactics I had seen in a long time - the email truly created a frenzy. 
* **Create content that is relevant:** Guys I know as e-com owners we are all sick to death about hearing about content this and content that but it is still really important. If you have a fashion brand and you are struggle to shift your stock, you should create 'outfit idea' blog posts with links to your product landing pages. This is much easier for visitors to understand than just looking at product images on your ecommerce store's site. 

Honestly I have nothing to gain at all from talking about these stores but I think their tactics are ones that we should copy and emulate because they are winning and making billions and millions of pounds/dollars etc. I think finding daily new arrivals is the most potent tactic because it truly creates pressure for people to visit your store every day in order to buy products. 

Which e-commerce strategies do you think you should do more of for the Christmas rush?",21,34,2018-10-14,ECOM,0.04785940423607826,0.9217174649238586,0.03042314574122429

dropship,How to not take forever to make your first sale,"I was just watching a very prominent drop shipper’s video and he said that when he started out it took him 2 months of constantly testing ads to get his first sale, and that the sale he got was most likely out of luck. This gave me a proper dose of reality, and I know this is not a get rich quick sort of thing, but guys, come on. Two months is insane.  I do not have the budget to advertise for that long, and to be honest, I don’t know if I have the fortitude of willpower and self belief for it. That’s a character flaw, but I’m being honest. 

There has to be a better way...right? There has to be a method or a way to get your first sale quicker than that. 

Edit: just made my first sale!!!!!!!!

Edit 2: Second sale!!!!

Edit 3: 6th day going just made 7 sales!!! Had my first $100 day did $153 in sales!

Edit 4: two weeks in, I just broke $500 in sales 

Edit 5: day 18: things have been slow lately, I made a sale today and yesterday, before that I had a couple days without sales. I’ve been playing around with video ads, different ways of doing product descriptions, and also using a new product research method. I have also just bought a drop shipping course. 

Edit 6: day 28: Hit $1,000 in sales yesterday. Going into the weekend I saw that I was close and made it my goal because I thought it would be pretty neat to do a thousand my first month. I wasn’t sure if I would hit it but fortunately i did with a day to spare. Now, onto the next goal. Immediate plans for the store are to begin email and Instagram marketing.

dropship,Better Prices than AliExpress on Drop-shipped Goods: An Example Case Scenario,"We had a potential client, an online seller, who told us he was sourcing about 100 of the top-selling products of a particular seller on AliExpress and having that seller drop-ship them to his customers.

Our goal was to search for a supplier here in China from whom we could purchase the products and quote the client a lower price and or/faster shipping. So, we went to work. We took the AliExpress seller’s very best-selling product as one of our first target products, which was the backpack shown in the link below…

[https://i.postimg.cc/nV3ZTBTz/Ali-Express-Back-Pack.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nV3ZTBTz/Ali-Express-Back-Pack.png)

On AliExpress, from this supplier, the client would pay **$20.89/piece** for one backpack, including shipping by ePacket to his customers in the U.S.A. If he were to buy 10 of these at one time, he would get a discounted price of $20.47/piece.

We then checked our Chinese domestic wholesale channels and were able to identify multiple sources of exactly this model of backpack, in the various colors indicated above. From among those, we chose a seller with both a comparatively lower price and lower minimum order quantity. After checking the weight, calculating our shipping and handling costs, and adding a modest markup for ourselves, we found that we could offer this product at a MOQ of only 3 pieces per order — including ePacket shipping to the client’s customers — for only **$16.44/piece**, i.e. a *savings of over 21%* compared to the price he would pay his current supplier for the same.",8,10,2018-10-16,ECOM,0.05259985104203224,0.901344358921051,0.04605580121278763

shopify,Advice and help needed.,"Hi Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I just launched this store a few days ago and I'm not getting sales. Let me begin from the start, A few months ago I started a Instagram page with the purpose of opening my own clothing brand. After months of working with Instagram i build a following and received countless messages about people wanting to be brand ambassadors and wanting to promote my brand. Now when we contacted them most of them shrugged us off as they wanted free items to ""promote"" us. I understand that its a price to pay but we are selective on who we will chose to give things away for free. We offered those brand ambassadors discount codes that has a clause which would give them store credit / free items depending on the reach their codes generate. While my website was under construction but was announced i received over 400 website views over 42 days. Now once we launched we received a similar amount over 5 days, All that only yielded in two sales...

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my problem lies, I need advice on how I can drive more traffic to  my website and how I can increase my conversion rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now a little on the business, we are not a drop shipping service so we can actually deliver the product quickly and at a very low cost. Although we are new to the e-commerce game, we were able to negotiate some killer shipping deals which allows us to have 10$ flat rate shipping in the USA. ( We are based out of Canada). Now i know our Canadian, shipping isn't the greatest and we are currently working on getting better pricing but without sales we have no leverage to negotiate. More on our strength would lie with the fact that we are priced in Canadian and are able to have appealing pricing to both our US and Canadian customers due to the weak Canadian dollar.

ecommerce,Anyone selling apparel on their niche site as secondary merchandise as possibly a marketing tool?,"Hey everyone 

My product is based on a hobby, let’s say tent camping, and I sell tents and sleeping bags etc. I thought about adding apparel about it to my website as a secondary item, maybe even to offer as a present for high priced carts. The idea is, it is a cool T-shirt and when they wear it, they can remember my product, or if somebody says cool T-shirt, they can say they got it for free or cheap at this website. The idea is that people like to talk about their hobbies. People can wear apparel about their hobbies. I want to be remembered every time they go through their drawers.

That is of course my speculation. Has anyone done anything like that? If so, seen a difference in sales at all? Or am I full of nonsense? 

PS: I actually bought a T-shirt about my actual niche that I really liked.

ecommerce,Shipping suggestions large flat items,"Hello,

I currently run an ecommerce site that sells large, thin items that can't be folded or bent. They range in size from 16""x12"" to 20""x8"" and all really flat (1/4""-1/2"" thick). I am having a challenge finding an economical method to ship these. I am in the US, and currently am only shipping to the US. I am shipping them in the lightest box I can find, but it still puts it over 1lb, so I have to ship Priority mail USPS. 

I have tried to find thick paperboard envelopes, but haven't been able to find any big enough. I have also looked for lightweight boxes, but they end up costing like $3 each, and combined with the shipping cost, it's just as expensive for me to ship in a free Priority mail box from the post office.

Currently my average order size is about $17, and I do charge the customer $3.99 for shipping (this is included in the average order amount), but it costs me about $7.50 to ship USPS Priority.

I have also thought about getting large poly mailers and putting a single piece of cardboard in to protect the items and keep them from being bent, but I am not sure if I like this, as I want the packing to look somewhat professional, instead of just a random gray poly mailer with cardboard inside. (I have ordered from my competitors, and this is how they ship).

dropship,"I created an app to import items to Shopify from Aliexpress, and fulfill Shopify &amp; Clickfunnels orders FULLY automatically (Free)","For the past year or so, I have been working to create Autolo, an app which allows you to fulfill droshipping orders from Shopify and Clickfunnels completely automatically on aliexpress. Currently, there are a lot of applications such as Oberlo and dropified which allow you to import items from Aliexpress to your store, and which partially automate the order fulfillment process. However, this still means that for every order you have to click a button to order the product on Aliexpress, and manually enter the checkout process. Autolo allows you to import items to your store, and when an order is placed containing the Autolo item on Shopify or Click Funnels, the order will be automatically purchased on Aliexpress and left in the ""Awaiting payment"" section of your Aliexpress account for you to verify, and pay for later.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted here a few months ago when we had just finished our first version, and since then we've been incorporating feedback and working to create Autolo 2.0. With the new version, Autolo is now a fully standalone application, and with the use of our chrome extension, items can be imported from Aliexpress to Autolo, and from there they can be pushed to Shopify. Once you've imported a product to Shopify, your orders will be monitored automatically, and anytime a new purchase comes in on Shopify or Clickfunnels, it will be automatically fulfilled by Autolo.

Please be aware, our product is in active development, and as such please note that there may be bugs (if you encounter one, please let us know via our website, or through this reddit post).

I just released a new tool for eCommerce owners to monitor their competitor's products prices, and I'm looking for beta testers to get some feedback.

Instead of manually checking your competitor's store to adapt your pricing strategy, you can let PricingBot do the job.

You will receive a daily email alert on each price changes, and you will have access to analytics about your competitors (price charts, availability...)

&amp;#x200B;

We have a one click integration with Shopify so you can add your products easily. The only thing you'll have to do is to link your products to your competitor's URLs (a Chrome extension is coming this week to make this even easier)

&amp;#x200B;

The website is still in (free) beta, so there may be bugs, don't hesitate to let me know

I'd really appreciate some feedback :)

I don't know who they are yet!

My initial idea was advertise two different product ""styles"" to all ages and all genders, everywhere I deliver. I had hoped the data that comes through; sales, clicks, engagement etc. would point me towards who I \*should\* be targeting... that has not happened. So far I am struggling to find any kind of simillarities, especially in the most important metric; conversions. As the days go by, my reach slowly drops.

dropship,This is how I find profitable items to dropship from Amazon to eBay,"For the last 3 years I have been doing Amazon to eBay Dropshipping. And this is one of my strategies to find good items to sell.

First step I go to Amazon bestseller list and pick a random product from any category and search the same product on eBay. If you don't find anything, just take the next product from Amazon.

Step 2. I filter the eBay results for new, buy now (and sold).

Step 3. I will scan over the results and open the listings in a new tap if the price is higher than the Amazon price is.

Step 4. Now we should have a few taps open with products that are more expansive than the one on Amazon. But we want to see more, so we click on the sellers other items.

Step 5. Now we have a whole lot of products that might also be cheaper on Amazon. We will filter again to look only at the sold items.

Step 6. Go through all items and check if they are cheaper on Amazon.

Step 7. If you found a winner, list it to eBay.

That's it. Pretty easy. Any noobie should be able to do this.

In this video I show how to do it step by step:
https://youtu.be/qgTbgmWRwaQ

BUT let me add a twist to it.
I developed a chrome extension that makes this process even easier and faster. It creates an overlay over the eBay site and displays the Amazon price next to the eBay listings and also shows the percentage of the difference. With one click you can copy the Asin or click through to the item page on Amazon.
I hope you will like my first app ever, your feedback is much appreciated.

dropship,Add dropshipping to my existing business or start from scratch?,"Hey all. Already run a successful e-commerce business (re)shipping imported physical goods, thinking about adding some dropship products, too! I’m in a fabulous niche with TONS of expansion potential. Finding plenty of products my existing customers would absolutely eat up, but I’m wondering if I should even add them to my existing brand, or just create another &amp; use my pre-existing social media accounts, etc, to cross-promote. 

Considerations:
The stuff I sell now does well, in part, due to my packing process. Orders come /beautifully/ packaged up and branded— I believe this goes a LONG way in retaining a very high level of return customers 👌🏻 

My ship times are already pretty slow, though, since I do everything myself. Things tend to back up fairly often, which makes the prospect of taking some fufillment off of my plate a HUGE plus. Don’t think the wait time would be any issue with existing customers. 

I’m mostly unsure about satisfaction, even with a huge disclaimer that stuff won’t ship in our usual packaging and could take just as long to arrive. I ordered a few samples to experience what the customer would, which arrived just fine, but the customs declaration of price makes me a bit nervous. I feel (kind of) bad for blatantly charging someone $25 for a phone case that’ll arrive along with the customs value of $1.19 prominently displayed 😒

 I’m essentially self-private labeling some dropship products already to avoid this exact issue. Makes the products seem less cheap 😅 It’s a shitload of work tho and less physical order fulfillment sounds like a dream come true. 

So whaddya think? Should I try out integrating dropship to my current business or start from scratch? Your thoughts are gr8ly appreciated 🌝",1,5,2018-10-25,ECOM,0.0731976181268692,0.8986797332763672,0.028122683987021446

dropship,10 frequently asked questions on dropshipping from China,"Dropshipping is a very popular online business in recent years! We flashleopard, as an experienced dropshipping china agent, usually meet bellowing 10 frequently asked questions on how to dropship from china, and some questions on dropshipping products.

📷

1. How fast you can ship out dropshipping orders?

Dropshippers all understand how shipping time effect their business. Fast shipping can meet clients request on efficiency, thus bring higher store reviews, and fewer dispute on shipping issues. Dropshipping partners, no matter aliexpress agents or independent dropshipping fulfillment agents, usually can provide tracking numbers in 1 to 2 days, but you can see sometimes the tracking just shown no update on internet after weeks or even one month, Why this is happening?

Actually, tracking numbers can be offered immediately when orders are placed. Still the processing time and parcel collection time is not known for sure. 48 hours processing time is most acceptable for dropshippers, but, the shipping time would be very long if following occasion happens:

l Lack of inventory: the goods you ordered do not have stock. Production and domestic shipping may take more than 1 week.

l Dropshipping fulfillment agents are incapable of packing and sending your parcels out in 1 to 2 days, since lack of human labor, or too many orders to be processed. This may take another 3-5 days to process your orders as packed and ready to ship status.

l Peak season. In peak season, parcels’ internet updating and transshipment will become slow. This will happen when end of October to November.

So, back to the question, how fast the dropshipping orders can be shipped out? Or how long does aliexpress take to ship? Generally should be in accord with shipping method you choose. Averagely, Epacket (aliexpress standard shipping) takes about 10-15 days; USPS and other express to specific country, takes about 10-12 days. China Register Air Mail about 20-35 days. Free shipping about 35-50 days. But you need to check with your aliexpress supplier and agents, **what is their processing time?** You need to count this time in, to get the real shipment time period. Flashleopard, as a most supportive droshipping agent, always following the discipline of 100% stock for free, and 48 hours processing time. To make our clients’ business grow bigger and bigger.

2. What is the most popular niche you are selling?

To get a winning product is what all dropshippers are looking for all the time being. So our clients will sometimes ask us about the trends, like, what are the best dropship niches? Can you recommend best aliexpress products to dropship, or best drop shipping niches 2018?

From our view, best selling dropshipping products are changing per year or per month! Like in year 2018, printing on demand products are becoming hot than previously. Still, some products and niches seems popular all the time being, like china dropship clothing, aliexpress wholesale jewelry

, consumer electric gadgets, and As Seen On TV, TV shopping products. These are always hot selling products. This question is like weather its good to open a general store or a specific niche store? Which one is better, depends on the way you market, and the strategy you are using.

Usually we will recommend clients some popular niche, but not specific product, since the winning product for person A, may not suitable for person B. Still you will need to put Facebook Ads on, to test out the winning product that is suitable for you!

📷

Again, our website will keep updating with the latest best sellers from our factory suppliers, like weekly. You can check to see, or contact us for more details: [www.flashleopard.com](http://www.flashleopard.com/)

3. What shipping method you are using for drop shipping products?

For ordinary products, Epacket would be the most frequently used shipping method. It can reach 33 countries. For the places eub shipping can not reach, clients will usually choose China Registered Air Mail shipping.

Also fulfillment agent will offer other shipping methods like Bpost, Turkey post, etc. For products contain electric or liquid, battery, etc. And if clients want faster shipping. We will have other choices like USPS and ETK to US; Canada, Australia, Germany, UK express, etc.

📷

4. Is Epacket reliable, why no update after a long time period?

Epacket is quite reliable, and most steady shipping method fro dropshipping orders. Still in Peak seasons, the shipment time period would be longer than usual. And sometimes, the transshipment information updating would be slow than usual. Still it’s one of a best shipping methods to choose.

5. What is your procedure of dropshipping orders fulfillment?

Since we are a group of people who provide sourcing, quoting, packing and shipping services, we will process your dropshipping orders offline. Like:

Thirdly, after your payment, we will buy stock to our dropship warehouse and QC 100% for your ordered products. Then send them out via per shipping method we both agreed with.

Fourthly, we will send back tracking number to you, and do after sales when problem happened.

ecommerce,A basic marketing KPIs for ecommerce framework,"Imagine you just started a new job and are leading marketing for a small or newer ecommerce business (or alternatively you started an ecommerce business yourself ). Before you start your marketing efforts you are tasked with defining marketing KPIs for ecommerce in order to be able to track the success of your marketing campaigns. The only tracking tool you are using is Google Analytics.

Sounds scary right? With no starting points to begin with this sounds like a huge and complex venture as there are so many potential metrics to choose. In addition you are probably scared that as you don’t know an immediate answer, people will soon start asking how somebody like you was hired to lead marketing (or be an analyst respectively). And as such not long until you get fired or replaced by somebody else.

*So what if you had a concrete KPI framework to follow for marketing. You would know exactly which marketing efforts work and what to focus on.  All leading to skyrocketing sales.*

That’s what this guide is for. Step-by-step it will show you how to systematically develop a marketing KPIs for ecommerce  framework directly derived from your business objectives. No other tool besides Google Analytics will be necessary for this. At the end of this article you’ll also find a done-for-you custom report template, which you can instantly add to Google Analytics in order to use your new metric framework.

&amp;#x200B;

## Getting started

This guide and framework relies heavily on the work from Avinash Kaushik and is adjusted for an ecommerce context. Be sure to check out his blog, if you haven’t.

One of the reasons why setting up a marketing ecommerce KPI framework can be so overwhelming is that there are hundreds of metrics to choose from. E.g. should you focus on bounce rate or clicks? Are conversions the only metric to look at? Or are others equally important? In this guide you will reduce the large number of metrics you could look at, while focusing only on those, which are really important for your ecommerce business.

In general when setting up a marketing KPI framework you should always make sure to track and cover all of the following areas of the consumer journey with your metrics:

Acquisition: How will users be acquired?

Behavior: What should the users do on the website?

Outcome: What’s the final desired result you want to achieve?

These are the guiding questions you should alway keep in mind when designing your new marketing KPIs for ecommerce framework. The setup of the framework itself then follows five steps:

* Step one is to identify the business objectives of your company. Why does it actually exist?
* Step two is to identify goals for each business objective. Think of goals as steps to take to reach the objectives.
* Step three is to define the key performance indicators. So basically metrics that help you understand how you are doing.
* Step four is to identify targets for each KPI, indicating, if you are succeeding or failing.
* Step five is to identify segments of people / behavior / outcomes that can be analyzed further.

&amp;#x200B;

## Step 1 – Define the business objectives.

Most ecommerce businesses have three objectives in common: They want to grow and as such increase their sales revenue. They want their brand to become more well known and doing so build brand awareness. And last but not least they to want build an audience or more specifically an email list, which they can nurture.

Obviously not all of those objectives must be relevant for you and you can decide to use only part of below metrics. However those objectives are usually the common denominator for the majority of smaller or newer ecommerce businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

## Step 2 – Identify goals for each objective

Goals are basically the specific levers you have to pull to accomplish your business objectives.

**Business Objective 1: Increase sales revenue**

As you want to increase the absolute number of sales as well as the efficiency of your sales process we will work with three different goals here.

As a first goal we want to increase the number of orders, second we want to improve your conversion rate in order to convert the website traffic more efficiently and as a last we want to increase your average order value in order to rise customer value.

**Business Objective 2: Create brand awareness**

We want to get your brand more well known and more people visiting your store. As such we will set two goals here. First we want to get more visitors overall to your website and second more specifically we want to increase the number of new website visitors.

**Business Objective 3: Generate leads**

Last but not least we want to build an engaged audience with an email list that you can nurture. Therefore your last goal here is to increase newsletter sign-ups through the website blog.

&amp;#x200B;

## Step 3 – Define the marketing KPIs for ecommerce

For each objective we will need metrics, which tell us how you are doing against each objective and goals respectively. Those metrics are called key performance (KPIs).

**Business Objective 1: Increase sales revenue**

As we want to increase number of sales, sale efficiency and average order value we will also define your KPI’s accordingly. Therefore the KPIs to focus on here are Transactions, Avg. Order Value and Ecommerce Conversion Rate.

**Business Objective 2: Create brand awareness**

Not only do we want more visitors coming to your website, which is why we track number of total *Users* as one KPI but we specifically want new visitors. Ergo the second KPI is number of *New Users*.

**Business Objective 3: Generate leads**

As your goal is to build an audience or email list, we will be tracking the number of newsletter S*ign-Ups* as a KPI here.

&amp;#x200B;

## Step 4 – Set targets

It is important to set targets for each KPIs upfront in order to have indicators of success or failure. Failing to set those will make it impossible to determine, if your marketing campaign was successful or not. It is not possible to generalize what the targets should be for you business specifically. E.g. increasing sales by 100 orders could be huge marketing success for an online store just starting out but a marketing campaign failure for a store, which makes millions in revenue already.

There are three main options to determine targets. Either you look at historical performance, e.g. “we had 100 orders at this point last year, which is why we want to have 120 this year”.

Or, if you don’t have historical data you can look at ways to substitute that data. E.g. is there a competitor, which sales you can estimate? Or numbers from a similar product you have been selling before?

Last option is to ask internal or external people. E.g. internally you could ask people, who have been working there before you such as management or the founders. If those don’t exist or aren’t available, try to find external sources as for example your clients (for validation), consultants or other ecommerce people to approximate sales and other metrics.

I know this step might seem intimidating. But setting any target is better than no target at all. If you still don’t have a clue how to set your targets, try to set a number, that if when reached won’t make you feel too bad. The more experience you get the better your targets well be. As such just set a number to start with and revise it as time goes by and you get more data to base it on.

&amp;#x200B;

## Step 5 – Create segments to analyze

There are probably a few people, who will stop thinking about their marketing analytics framework after step 3 and as such not set any targets. But I bet that the majority will wrap it up after step 4 the latest and will not define any meaningful segments.

Segments can be anything from the traffic sources, your user behavior onsite, the kind of users attracted. Basically anything you can segment your KPI metric reports with and which will tell you more on how to achieve your business objectives.

Segmentation is the only way to give your KPIs a meaningful sense and make them actionable. E.g. it is nice to know that 30% of your visitors are new users, however this insight becomes truly actionable, when you know that 100% of those come from PPC advertising.

We will define the following segments for your ecommerce store:

Source – Where did the users come from? Social Media, referral, organic, etc.? This segment is relevant for all your KPIs. As such you could ask, which sources drive the most sales or where most new users come from. As somebody working in marketing this will probably one of the most important segmentations for you in order to decide, which marketing channels to focus on.

User Type – Should you focus on new or existing users? E.g. you can track which group accounts for most revenue or which source refers the most new users. You can easily focus your marketing efforts accordingly on either group by looking at this segmentation.

Page Title – Segmenting by pages allows you to see which content performs best. As such you can answer questions, as for example which blog post had the most newsletter sign-ups or which article had the best performance in terms of user acquisition.

As you can see segmentation is the final step to make your KPIs actionable. You will know exactly what type of traffic source, content, etc performs the best and where you should focus. Feel free to add your own segments, depending on what makes most sense for you.

That’s it! We went through a structured approach to determine which KPIs to use, derived directly from the business objectives. We kept in mind the acquisition of customers (user metrics), the behavior they should show on the site (newsletter signups, conversion rate) as well as the outcome we want (conversions and transaction value), while having a relatively low overall number of metrics to track. Last step is to implement those metrics in a custom report in Google Analytics.

ecommerce,[X-post from r/entrepreneur] Looking to ask a few questions to German Entrepreneurs with a running eCommerce business (NOT DROPSHIP!),"Hey friends, 

As the title suggests - I would love to ask a few questions to someone living in and having their business registered in Germany for an ecommerce platform. It's no secret that German laws (especially that of eCom) are incredibly challenging, strict and persecuted. So, I would really appreciate it if you could help me out here (Yes, I do live in Germany and I have a business but it's not ecommerce). 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Regarding the law, what are the absolute must have legal documents to have an ecommerce store selling digital downloads? I tried googling but I could never get a definite answer or a checklist of things to have. 

2. I know this is subjective, but would a GbR, GmbH or UZ(?) be the best option? I know it's all coming down to liability but I'm just curious what you think. 

3. We have a business that is in the service industry and it's currently registered as a GbR (and we're thinking of moving it to UZ (Im not sure if that abbreviation is right) for our own reasons.) and I wanted to know if it's a good idea to add a new ""business"" under the same company? Thats what we're hoping for to keep things together and if the new business grows bigger - then we'd opt to register it independantly. 

4. What would you say is the hardest part about having an ecommerce business in Germany (regardless of sales / conversions)? 

5. Sorry if this is a stupid one; but if a company is registered in, for example, Austria or France or anywhere else in the EU, would certain German laws still apply to it if the market is including Germany? 

6. If you are using Wordpress for your ecommerce store, are you using Woocommerce and making it compliant with the German law (and plugin suggestions?), or are you using external platforms like digistore24 to handle somethings? 

7. Do you have any advice on tracking / managing tax from an ecommerce store? We have an accountant for our other business so I can always pass those things onto them but I just thought there may be a few things out there that is good to know in advance. 

8. Have you ever been a victim of competition sending lawyers to audit your platform and find mistakes to sue you with (this recently happened to us; but for something else)? what would be the best way to avoid this (besides abstinence haha).

9. If your market is international, how are you dealing with sales tax in other countries? Does that even apply?

10. If you market is international, are you having your platform in English or do you offer multiple languages? 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, that should be it for now - or at least  - until I press ""Post"" and i think of 5 other things I should have asked. But I'll try keep this to the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so very much for your time!

Viel Spaß!

shopify,THE #1 Thing to help make sales on your store,"I see a ton of posts about new stores, no sales, etc. There's a bunch of reasons why that might happen, but here's the #1 tip I can give ANYONE starting off in e-commerce is to build credibility on your store.

How you can do that:

1. Have a phone number on the site for customer service. It give people confidence that they can get in touch with a real person
2. Post your address
3. Clearly state all your policies (return, shipping, etc)

There's a bunch more, but these things are crucial for startup ventures. You can get a simple mailing address from a your local mailbox store, a number of online services and a free Google Voice number (in the US) or a pretty cheap VOIP number.

This isn't going to be a magic fix, but think about how you purchase. Don't you want to know that a PERSON will be accessible if you have a problem, not just some random info@ email.",10,18,2018-10-30,ECOM,0.02605714090168476,0.9356217980384827,0.038321107625961304

So the sequence of events so far:

5. Proof of Delivery is signed under the name of a mail room staff but the signature is just a dot and not his actual signature
6. Customer confirms with surveillance cameras and mail room staff that nothing was received
7. Shipping company confirms with GPS coordination and the driver that it was delivered to the mailing room

I do not have access to either of the confirmations. Someone here must be lying. What the hell do I do?

shopify,Just made my first sale!!!,"I just made my first sale tonight!! :D

I just created this store about 7 days ago, and I launched my first ad last night, and just landed my first sale after 26 hours on a $5 adset! (1 interest, 1 engaged shopper behavior)

I found out about Shopify dropshipping about 4 months ago, and have been studying hard almost every day straight, and saving up money from babysitting once a week and the odd freelance job.

You guys have no idea how anxious I felt (you probably do really :P) every time my phone vibrated! I was scared to check it every single time, because of the sort of Schrodinger's cat paradox.

""If I don't check it, I probably have a sale. If I check it, it's probably another spam email.""

I actually found out about dropshipping because I was burnt out from doing daily renders (I'm a freelance 3D artist), and trying to snatch the elusive client.

I was burnt out hard, depressed as hell, and played gtav for like, 2 weeks straight. To the point where I was hustling hard, making tons of businesses in game, and trying to figure out how to scale up my ""empire"".

I was searching all day long the best ways to make a lot of money quickly in the game... Then one morning, as I was on YouTube, and saw an ad from Alex Becker showing how a dad sold something like $140k worth of mugs in a month and how easy it is for you to do the same thing.

I obviously went and watched his seminar, aaaaaaaand yeah he's just trying to sell a course.

But the foundation was there. I learned enough from that seminar to start doing my own research and really figure it out for myself.

4 months later, probably around a thousand hours worth of videos watched, dozens and dozens of different ""gurus"", and bouncing different MANY store ideas and products around, I finally landed on one this week, and it let me to making my very first sale the next day.

It feels like all this weight has been lifted. It's like in a horror movie, and they just build tension for a jump scare. Learning all this stuff, and the actually getting to the point of actually *TAKING ACTION*, has been so scary for me... But it was worth it!

Here's to many more to come, and I wish you all luck on your own endeavor! &lt;3",36,54,2018-10-31,ECOM,0.03367161005735397,0.9266840219497681,0.03964436799287796

If so what was your experience and is it just like Alixpress where almost every product (with epacket capabilities of course) can be dropshipped? The reason I ask is because Lightinthebox has a website called dropinthebox or something like that which I looked into using however it doesnt have my product so I'm kind of stump.
