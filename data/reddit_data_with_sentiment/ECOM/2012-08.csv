ecommerce,Suggestion on B2B package where majority of products will be shipped direct from multiple manufactures.  Seamless shopping experience for user.,"I am looking for some recommendations for a pure B2B/Wholesale website and backoffice where the products will be drop shipped by the individual manufacturers.  A single cart, single payment, orders placed and shipped by different manufactures.  I have access to plenty of technical resources that could customize or even build from scratch, but want to see how much might already be available in an off-the-shelf solution.

*  bCommerce site that requires login

*  Rates and discounts by user

*  Support thousands of vendors with ability to establish unique rules for each (minimums, lead time, case size, etc)

*  Single cart but able to analyze by vendor to ensure minimums are met.

*  Vendor screens to accept and process orders

*  Payment clearinghouse

*  Integration into accounting software

Not looking for free or cheap rather looking for best within reason.  I am working on a full requirements document with the assumption may have to do a full build or heavily modify an open source package.  

Any suggestions as to packages that will get me at least close to a full solution?

Edit:  Think Amazon if Amazon did not have their own warehouses and relied on the vendors to do all drop shipping.",5,3,2012-08-04,ECOM,0.08602283149957657,0.8864221572875977,0.027555080130696297

I started as an assistant manager and worked my way up.  Six months ago I was promoted to our allocations and merchandising team.  They told me today they are going to move me to our E-commerce team which is set to launch late this fall.  I've never worked in E-commerce and while excited for this opportunity, I have no idea what I'm getting myself into.  
What I know so far is, I'll be responsible for projecting out what items I think will sell really well on our online store and then transferring them from our main warehouse to our e commerce warehouse.  
Other than that, I have absolutely no clue what I'll be doing.

ecommerce,Drop Shippers: How do you deal with channels UPC code requirements?,"I'm just wondering how you guys deal with the requirement of providing UPC (or GTIN, EAN) codes for products from your drop shippers' feeds. All the major marketplaces, other than eBay for now, require this information otherwise they do not accpet the items. 

We're only dealing with a few dozen feeds but having a nightmarish time 1) getting UPC codes  and 2) getting the CORRECT codes. 
If we do manage to find the UPC codes, often in the marketplaces (I'm looking at you Amazon), some other person has added a different item under the UPC code, rendering our optimization efforts to nil.

I'm curious to hear how you deal with this issue.

ecommerce,"Down to 3 competing carts: 3dcart, CoreCommerce, Magento.","In short: we're replacing Zoovy and San Diego Media's MaxEXP as they cater to small companies and don't offer much flexibility in the way of 3rd party extensions or custom work. They are reasonably fast and have good uptime but they are small companies with limited developer ""horsepower"". When I see the words ""tailored to your needs"", ""Custom fit solution"" and ""for beginners"" or ""designed for small business owners"", I run. These are buzz-kill words for me :)

I have compared 90 carts (yes, really!) with help of the **excellent** Wikipedia article [Comparison of shopping cart software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_shopping_cart_software) and I narrowed it pretty much down to these three carts.

I want professional support, not having to worry about hosting, good B2B features (qty discounts, special customer group pricing), a CMS, up to 10,000 SKUs, selling on Amazon marketplace, and Google Checkout (soon to be Google Wallet). 

These three seem to be the most competent shopping cart solutions out there, with Magento being open source which is fantastic, but brings extra overhead in the way of setup and security, management etc.

What can you guys recommend on this? Am I on the right track to finding a good solution? Any thoughts on Volusion (seems limited to me)?

**Important note: 3dcart doesn't have an option to import product reviews. This could be a major roadblock.**",9,3,2012-08-30,ECOM,0.024182142689824104,0.9139612913131714,0.06185660883784294
