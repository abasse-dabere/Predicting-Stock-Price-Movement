ecommerce,Advice for non-ecommerce guy on which eCommerce systems support a certain set of features.,"Hello fellow redditors,

One of my clients is essentially a distributor.  They do not maintain any inventory.  They have a number of clients that order products through them, and they will in turn fulfill the orders via any number of wholesalers who will drop-ship the product directly to the end-clients.  

They also have relationships with independent sales reps.  The reps are assigned to certain client accounts, and will engage with the clients and often order product through the company on behalf of the clients.  The reps should only order on behalf of the clients to whom they are assigned.  

They need to support client-specific pricing, and clients do not need visibility when ordering as to which vendors can/will ultimately fulfill the order.  Pretty vanilla stuff I think.

They have evaluated one eCommerce system so far (TradeGecko) which seems to provide most of the ordering functionality they need except that it doesn't support both the client ordering directly AND the reps placing orders on behalf of the clients, nor does it support the concept of assigning reps to clients.  

I develop custom software and don't have experience with turn-key eCommerce systems.  I developed another system for this client in the past, so they contacted me about building something to do this, but I figure there are hundreds of suites that already do this in one way or another.

I'm looking for any suggestions on systems (or combination of CRM/ERP/eCommerce systems) people have implemented with good results.  I think they'd prefer SaaS solutions, but self-hosted systems are not entirely out of the question either.  I just don't want to waste guy's time/money developing something custom if he could get something turn-key going in a few days/weeks.

Many thanks for all suggestions.",6,5,2016-02-01,ECOM,0.02435905486345291,0.929168164730072,0.046472810208797455

ecommerce,Buy Now vs. Add to Cart (Amazon + PrintFul),"Our shopping platform is 90% Affiliate, 10% exclusive products we sell. The challenge we're having is that affiliate products get redirected once you check-out. However, we just started selling our own products through theprintful which require the user to go back to our shopping page after being re-directed to buy those products specifically.

When the redirect happens, I have a page where I explain everything to them in a matter of 5 to 6 seconds before it goes to Amazon.

This doesn't really settle well with me, but I don't want my users to quickly leave the site. Another option I can do is remove the shopping cart function for affiliate products and just simply have a Buy now that will redirect the user immediately in a new tab, leaving the check-out option only for exclusives I sell through printful.

Hey guys, appreciate the feedback. Brand is pretty unique, both in terms of style and especially in terms of fabric (we use 100% Alpaca wool from my home country of Bolivia).

This market, especially in terms of age demographic, is the most interesting for me (one I'd feel the happiest succeeding in), the one I can identify with best (I am in my mid 20s), and the least crowded in terms of competition (almost non existent).

ecommerce,"eCommerce disaster, reddit hope you can help out before I lose my mind.","I am attempting to integrate an ecommerce site with a Mercury FTD POS system using wordpress and woocommerce.  You can see the disaster here: http://i.imgur.com/WixZKfv.png  
  
Now, some context:

Essentially, the order details need to be sent via email in a particular format so the POS system can pick it up (after setting up mail server in pos) and auto-populate order screen, then be processed.  So for example, the email format is something like this:
  
Bill Name: John doe  
Bill Address1: 1234 Main St  
Bill Address2: apt 43  
Delivery Day:  02  
Delivery Month: 08  
Delivery Year: 2016  
  
and so on.  Problem is, apparently--according to web development team I hired--the customer must see fields EXACTLY as how they are required in email format.  The customer will read ""Bill Address1"" instead of just ""Address.""  
  
Also, instead of just seeing ""Requested Delivery Date,"" they must see ""Delivery Day ____ Delivery Month____Delivery Year____""  -- it looks bad, takes up a lot of space, and can be very confusing to the customer.
  
The team I have working on this claims there is no way for the customer to see text differently than what is input in the email that gets picked up by the POS system.  I requested implementing drop-down menus for things like dates, but I was told that they can only produce the word ""month"" instead of ""delivery month,"" as per the email formatting specs.  
  
I hope any of this makes sense, I've been working on this for over a week now and have just about lost my damn mind.  

I am also hoping to implement a multi-page checkout, where first page you enter shipping info, then billing info, then cc info, or whatever, just so it's not all jammed in one page like it is.  I am not sure if this will mess with the formatting in email (dev team claims it cannot be done successfully), and have been unable to get any clear answers in that regard.  
  
I am happy to provide login info if anyone would like to take a look inside.  Honestly, I'm about to just scrap the whole thing and find something more compatible with Mercury, if there is such a thing.

ecommerce,Looking for an open-source solution with some unique needs,"I've been battling between ecommerce solutions for the past few weeks but I'm a little unclear as to which one would fit some custom needs of mine:

1. Product specific pages not required (I just need a list of products with an ""add to cart"" button in the same row for some ""stores"")

2. Products should have variants and add-ons where customers can add options (e.g. if a product was a pizza, you might have multiple addons like: 
Extra cheese,
Pepperoni,
Canadian bacon,
Olives
(each addon would have a cost associated that would be summed up depending on how many the user selects)

3. Supports highly custom user models (no zipcodes, or states) and no distinction between billing or shipping addresses. Users should also be able to have multiple ""addresses"" and custom validation may be required also.

4. Has a REST api

5. Multi-vendor and multi-store functionality (so users can browse by store) The stores should be able to have metadata like opening hours so that users can't order outside of the opening hours

6. Customized cart where a user can only order from one store at a time.

7. Ability to write custom shipping modules

---------------------------------------------

So...there's kind of a lot of functionality needed but the key is an ecommerce solution that makes as few assumptions as possible and has modules that can help provide some of the functionality required. 

A lot of custom work will definitely be needed but what open-source platform out there would get as close to all this as possible? Magento 2? Spree? Solidus? Django-Oscar?",10,2,2016-02-07,ECOM,0.024266378954052925,0.9293100833892822,0.04642350226640701

ecommerce,Trademark question,"X-posted from /r/aal ,no replies over there. 

I'm selling an item on ebay, the manufacturer's name for the item contains the phrase ""super slick"".

The phrase ""super slick"" is trademarked, or so it says on the packaging of the product that I'm selling.

Another company sells a similar product, and they have trademarked the word ""slick"".

The company that owns the trademark for the word ""slick"" has filed a VERO claim with ebay to have my listings taken down, or to have the word ""slick"" removed from them.

This is the packaging fro my product: http://imgur.com/t9Ug6z4

The other guy's website: http://oilslickpad.com/products/slick-ball/

As previously mentioned, the products are quite similar- they serve the same function, though the shapes and colors may be a bit different.

I've taken my listings down, as this product simply does not sell, or at least not at a pricepoint that is profitable for me, so I'm not inclined to fight the takedown notice for monetary reasons. Part of me wants to fight it because it seems like bullshit, but I'm rational enough to take my few dollars loss and move on from what was never a profitable item anyway.

I'd still like to know if there's any legal precedent for this. I'm confused as to why I can't use the trademarked phrase that appears on the packaging of this product.

dropship,UK dropshipping marketplace?,"Hey everyone,

In the UK it can be a nightmare to find good reliable dropshippers. I realised this when I first started and I personally spent a very long time researching with little results. I always was taken back by the thought that there was not a platform where sellers and buyers could do business safely with community backed up feedback on dropship suppliers. We simple have to put our trust into a supplier and hope for the best. I personally believe this can be done in a much more efficient way. I came to the conclusion that there is a need for a dropshipping platform where dropship suppliers and buyers can come together and meet in an environment that is consistent and feels safe. A place where the process is the same for dealing with dropshippers and products are cataloged in a useful way.

I have just came up with an idea and wanted to get your feedback -

Should I create a collection for each category? Starting with the parent categories, creating a collection for each NFL, NBA, MLB category and then a collection for each child category, Cowboys, Yankees, Magic and so forth?

When someone clicks the 'NFL' category outright, I want the page to show each available team on that category page, preferably with a smaller team logo they can click on representing the child category.

ecommerce,"Exporting site - what platform, etc?","Thanks in advance for any advice.

I am an American living in Japan permanently.  The yen is weak now so exporting to the US or other nations is a good prospect.

I am just starting out now with this plan, hoping to have something going within a year in terms of an e-commerce shop.

The first question I have is what platforms (spotify, etc) would be better for exporting (if it makes any difference).

Next,  I am wondering how international drop shipping would go, if I went that route.  The only other option I know of is physically sourcing items here and taking them individually to the post office.  I can do that, but I am hoping to find a high volume method.

Last for now, is product mix.  I am thinking cosmetics, food (soy sauce, etc), language textbooks as a start.  Electronics here really have not been strong as they they were years ago.  Any recommendations would be great.

ecommerce,Request for Fulfilment Houses / Companies in France for B2B,"Hi All, I'm looking to choose from a list of recommended fulfilment houses (FH) in France that would fit well to a primarily B2B client of mine. They're based in Japan, so goods would be received into stock from their manufacturing base in Asia. Their current stock is held in a different French FH house, but I'm not certain they've chosen the right one for what they need so I'm evaluating options for them. 

My client ships moderately bulky wooden products to European retailers, averaging at about 5 - 10 customer orders per day. Orders can vary in weight from about 0.5kg to up to 35kg, but the average is on the lower-middle end of this scale. 

Ideally, the FH would dispatch orders in the early afternoon, and would be able to accept orders easily from the client's Shopify website (using an app/API or whatever). 

The FH should be able to provide my client with a website that has live data of shipments, stock, returns status etc. Ideally they should also provide some kind of returns/reverse fulfilment service in case of issues with products. 

My client are a little slow with tech, so whatever the recommendation, they'll need to be a bit patient in the early stages.

ecommerce,[Discussion] Analysis for setting prices in eComm,"I have no idea what level of sophistication folks have out there regarding pricing and I don’t know if this is helpful, but this process is something we use at larger companies.  The process can scale to smaller sales volumes using Excel.  If it is useful, I can post how to do the analysis in Excel with screenshots in Imgur.

An oft quoted statistic in pricing circles is from the Harvard business review “Managing Price, Gaining Profit” (you can search for it) that states a 1% increase in price can yield an 11% gain in profit.  It was written years ago, but we still quote it.  Of course there are a lot of dependencies such as your margin and demand but the point is – good pricing is important.

**Price and cost.**  Many businesses frequently price at cost plus rather than what the market will bear.  Cost plus pricing is simply pricing the product at some margin over cost and market pricing is pricing the product at what the market can support.  Cost and price are independent.  And sometimes the market price is below your cost.  But in other cases price is above your cost and you want to figure out what the most optimal price is to support your business goals.  So, how do you get there?

**Price demand curve.**  Price-demand is an economic tool statisticians use to help determine price.  Elaborate analysis is probably beyond what some businesses can reasonably achieve, but the techniques from using a price demand curve can be applied to most businesses.  The basic premise is obvious - price and demand are related.  The more you charge, the less demand there is for your product and the less you charge, the more you will sell.  There are many variables that affect your demand such as competition and market awareness but the underlying premise is sound.  A price-demand curve has increasing price on the Y axis and decreasing demand on the X axis.  The typical curve has a high price and low demand close to the Y axis then slopes downward to the X axis with higher demand as price decreases.

**Price testing.**  Sometimes it is difficult to get enough data to build an accurate demand curve.  But you can get it good enough then use basic analysis to set your price.  Price testing is the way to do it.  If your eComm system is sophisticated enough to do test and target, then you can randomly change the price by a few percentage points up and down for a period of time – say a week – and then collect your sales data.  If you can’t introduce randomness in your price, you can set it a couple points higher for a week, then move it lower for the next week, capture your sales data, then adjust your price.

**Estimating profit.**  The point of the exercise is to find the right price to support your goals.  So you take the results of your price testing and put it in a spreadsheet with price in one column and order quantity in a second column.  You can then do a frequency distribution and get a basic demand curve using a pivot table and histogram functionality in Excel.  Once you have that you can estimate your profit with the calculation of Profit = (Price – Cost) * Volume at extrapolated price and volume points.

The calculation can be run against the points on the pivot table.  Again, there probably isn’t enough data for this to be extremely accurate, but it gives you a guideline on where to move your price.  Pick the price that will maximize your goal for profit or volume.

**Price monitoring.**  After setting a new price, you need to monitor the sales volume to see if it validates your estimate.  Capture sales order data daily and put them in a spreadsheet with columns for date and order quantity.  A simple graph in Excel does the trick if you don’t have reporting tools.

This process doesn’t have to be elaborate but should be done on a regular basis.  You can just do basic price testing by moving the price up and down then monitor profit.  It doesn’t have to be optimal.  It’s still a win if you have a good price rather than the best price.

Again, I kept this at a high level, but if it is useful, I can post more details on how to do the analysis in Excel and the structure of the reports.  Just didn’t know if there would be any interest and hoping it would generate some discussion.",7,6,2016-02-12,ECOM,0.05018788203597069,0.9230682849884033,0.026743829250335693

shopify,Shopify themes/plugins,"Hi guys. Had several Shopify feature questions for building my online retail store. 

Is there any particular Shopify theme where it's editorial/content-focused and more of a magazine format with shoppable content, much like https://www.ssense.com/ [part shop, part magazine]? 

Also, how can I provide a personal ""storefront"" for each designer such like this: http://www.avenue32.com/designers/shrimps/storefront/? I'm looking to possibly provide a dedicated page for each designer, where they could feature content to promote their brand using videos for eg.

Another question, how could I implement mini flash sales like https://huckberry.com/store/brands/sales? Or another example here https://lux-fix.com/member-offers/wyse-london-womenswear--2, where there will be a member offer, and users have to register/sign in to see member pricing?

Last question, is there a way to include the two different product shots ""still view"" + ""model view"" such as this http://www.avenue32.com/clothing/dresses/all-dresses/?

- Easy to use admin panel

ecommerce,"After a lot of work I've finally got my first ecommerce business fully up and running! Really excited, would love your feedback.","Hi guys I’m sure this is a passion you share with me. Since before I can remember, I’ve wanted to launch my own company. I’m 26 and I’ve finally done it. 

I wanted to get feedback on my ecommerce business and site. This is for a new pair of socks that I designed and created to resolve a centuries-old problem of torn up holes in socks. 

**MY STORY**  
The conception of the idea started 8 months ago when I was fed up with torn up holes in my socks. My sock drawer is filled with hole-y socks. To resolve this problem, I decided to create a sock with Kevlar in the toe and heel to protect it and prevent holes from tearing open. I sourced a few samples via Alibaba and began testing the product rigorously. Once I was satisfied and realized the product worked, I ordered the first 1000x pairs in the design of my choice. I launched 2 weeks ago and I've generated 870 unique visitors to my site and have completed 3 organic sales so far.  

**YOUR FEEDBACK**  
I am currently looking for general feedback on my ecommerce business and ecommerce site at www.kevlowear.com. Some questions to consider:  

*  Would you change or add anything on the website?   

*  Is my product offering clear on the website?  

*  What are your thoughts on the price of 1 pair?  

*  I currently have Google AdWords and Google sponsored ads set up for my site. I also just began Facebook/Instagram sponsored ads. Are there other marketing/advertising tools you highly recommend using?  

*  Are there any recommended resources to learn more about SEO and implement a solid SEO strategy?   

Thanks guys!

ecommerce,Reminder: Amazon sucks and don't you forget it.,"I see many people fear Amazon so much. You can't compete, Amazon is like a monopoly, Amazon has the lowest prices, Amazon has the best user experience. Nothing of this is true. Read this review I just copied from another site, discussing their new threshold for free shipping. 

&gt;A few weeks ago I decided to do a bulk order. I ordered 18 items with a total of $110. They split my shipment into three packages of approximately $50, $50, and one item by itself in another box for $10. Since one of the boxes didn't have $35, they tried to charge me shipping.

&gt;I simply removed that item but instead of having two $50 boxes, the shopping cart removed an item from a box and put it into a box by itself to ensure that I had to pay shipping. I spent two hours adding and removing items to discover that there is no way to get free shipping for multiple items anymore.

&gt;Eventually I contacted customer service and they said they would take care of it and ship it in one box with no shipping cost.

&gt;Three weeks later and my order finally shipped, in 5 boxes, with 5 shipping fees charged to my card.

Amazon having the lowest prices is probably the biggest lie I've heard in my life. They have loss leaders alright, but a lot (defined 30%-50%) of their items are more expensive than the competition. 

Don't fear Amazon.",4,2,2016-02-22,ECOM,0.0814475491642952,0.8916870951652527,0.02686532773077488
ecommerce,Which payment gateway/service provider? PayPal or Braintree?,"There might be more options but the truth is I have no idea how a payment gateway works so my brain is kind of empty right now. 

I am just starting my e-commerce journey and I plan to use an open-source e-commerce site or maybe an e-commerce hosted platform. But one business term that I am not familiar with is the payment gateway. 

Some research tells me that the payment gateway handles the electronic transactions made by credit cards/debit cards and charges a percentage on every transaction made in my e-commerce store. But there are so many to choose from (more than 900). What information is needed to create an account on the payment service provider? Do I need to register a business in order to associate with a payment service provider?

Now here is my situation, I am staying in China and selling online to the world and I have registered a company in China. The number of payment gateways for China is limited. I have an Australian bank account and I can also get a Hong Kong bank account but I don't have business registered in these countries/area.

ecommerce,Help me flesh out an idea for getting into the ecommerce business with a local store.,"Hello! Sorry if this is long. Tried to cover the gist of it without going into great detail.

**Background:**
I've been mulling over how to get into ecommerce. At this moment, I am in the stages of reading everything I can and figuring out which approach to take. Keep in mind that I am a novice (with the exception of having sold on ebay and Etsy). I am very intelligent, and excel at whatever I take on; so I have no doubt that I can be quite good at this.

It will certainly include blogging with advertising and affiliate marketing. I'm also thinking about an online store and Amazon. The hindrance with the store (aside from figuring out what to carry) is capitol and storage space for my inventory. My interest is in the area of gardening, farming, backyard chickens, permaculture and food with integrity.

A very popular, local, tack and feed store is building a huge new store in my neighborhood. It's locally owned and has the kind of atmosphere that makes you want to hug the owners for having such a cool business. I'm at a crossroads in my career; and gave serious consideration to giving up my company and going to work there. Unfortunately, the opportunities are part-time retail; and that wouldn't work for me. Also, I have an entrepreneurial spirit and begin to lose my mind when tied to a time clock.
 
They are growing, but do not have any sort of online store or website. Their online presence is limited to their Facebook page. An inquiry revealed that they would like to have a store, but are too busy with the opening of the new location. Which brings me to the idea of a mutually-beneficial relationship. I have not, yet, been in contact with the owners.

**Idea:**

I would like to propose a complete ecommerce package, including the following (please help me cover what I may have missed):

* Shopify website
* Amazon
* Ebay
* Etsy (They sell some sculptures and I may do some artwork of my own)
* Instagram
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Blog

This will be a learning process; but I think I could use the experience to build up my skills as an ecommerce specialist. I'm fairly certain that this would not be an opportunity to sell a package (especially since I don't know all of the ropes); so I'm thinking to approach it as something like a base salary + commission plan.

Say that they pay for the websites and hosting, and I do the setup and maintenance. There would have to be some clause for buying me out, should they decide to take control of the process; and (of course) it would all be written out in a contract.

Once it is up and running, I'd sell my business and go into this full time; which would require that I earn something in the $50K range. Since their new store isn't due to open for a few months, it would give me time to go through the learning curve before the pressure would be on.

Is this a realistic idea? And, what kind of advice would you offer; from either the standpoint of the store owner or for me?

Thanks, in advance, for your help!",2,2,2016-02-22,ECOM,0.03924724832177162,0.9291462898254395,0.03160642459988594

ecommerce,Starting a shop with only one item.,"Hi, I consider starting my own shipyourenemiesglitter-store and I don't know where to start building my site. I'll try to summarize what the site should look like, I hope you can help me getting started. 

* Main goal is simple: order a letter of glitter to a certain adress or to the ""celebrity of the week"". 

* Payment should be possible through Paypal, other options are welcome but not required. 

* Before payment of a regular letter (not to celebrity of the week) consumers should be able to enter a code for a fixed reduction of the price. This so each letter delivered contains a code, and people will be more open to send back and forward. 



That's about it I think ... 

Is it best to just take a Shopify-like host to build a site, or isn't that needed since it's a very simple shop? What other options are worth considering?

ecommerce,Here Is a Summary of the Most Popular Payment Gateway Solutions,"We recently posted a question about what payment gateways you used and why (you can see that Q [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/462o2x/what_payment_gateway_do_you_use_and_why/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) ), and wanted to follow up with a summary of some of the most popular ones out there should you be looking to compare solutions: 

**Braintree**

Braintree has become a competitive payment gateway since its launch in 2010. Eventually getting acquired by PayPal, Braintree now operates as a “PayPal Company” and could be one of the most progressive movers in the payment industry.

They accept payments from PayPal, Apple Pay, Android Pay, Venmo, and even Coinbase (bitcoin)!  And, of course, they process traditional online payments as well. What’s notable about the company is their expansion into alternative payment methods. If your target demographic purchases through one of these alternative methods, you might consider Braintree as your payment gateway.

Supported Platforms: Bigcommerce, Magento, Spree Commerce, WooCommerce, Shopify (See other integrations [here] (https://www.braintreepayments.com/partners) )

Processing Rates

* 2.9%+ $0.30 transaction fee (after first $50,000)
* $15 chargeback fee
* See all pricing details [here] (https://www.braintreepayments.com/pricing)

Contract

There are no contract requirements with Braintree, and you get to take all of your customer data with you for free!

Clients: Bonobos, Airbnb, Uber, Casper, and more

**Stripe** (what we prefer to develop with)

Stripe began with a simple purpose: make it simple for businesses to do business online. They have a bit of a different appeal in that they build for developers, not merchants. This is an interesting approach for the company and shows their true vision is in the future.

By listening to and working with developers first, the company can be on the forefront of building progressive payment solutions. This was the case with their recent launch of Relay for Stripe. 

If it is important for your company to be on top of capturing sales in a “non-traditional way” (through a third-party app, via marketplace, through subscriptions), then Stripe could be the right solution for you.

Supported Platforms: Bigcommerce, Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, Spree Commerce (see other integrations [here] (https://stripe.com/docs/integrations) )

Processing Rates

* 2.9% + $0.30 (after first $1 million)
* $15 chargeback fee
* See all pricing details [here] (https://stripe.com/us/pricing)

Contract

There are no contract requirements, but you must have to agree to the Terms of Service &amp; Privacy Policy.

Clients: Harry’s, Fitbit, Task Rabbit, Lyft, and more

**Authorize.Net**

Authorize.Net has been in the payment processing space for a while – since 1996. Because of its seniority in the space, this provider has maintained a decent portion of the payment gateway market share. Like the above-mentioned gateways, Authorize.Net provides similar fraud protection services, subscription capabilities, and simple checkout options.

The downside is that if you need to transfer your data, you cannot do it as seamlessly as Braintree’s free migration service. If you want to eventually leave Authorize.Net you will have to redo the entire process of collecting payment information from your clients for recurring billing and payment method. Not fun for you or for customers. On the bright side, Authorize.Net has a friendly interface and allows you to get fairly granular with your security settings so this is a nice plus for your development team (learned this from /u/blk_slp)

Supported Platforms: Bigcommerce, Shopify, Volusion, WordPress, Magento (see other integrations [here] (https://www.authorize.net/solutions/merchantsolutions/merchantservices/certifiedsolutiondirectory/) )

Processing Rates

* $49 – Setup Fee
* $25 – Monthly Gateway Fee
* 2.9% + $0.30
* $25 chargeback fee

Contract

Authorize.Net has a month-to-month option with no early termination fees, but if you choose to go through a reseller, you may encounter a contract and termination fees. [Here is a detailed list] (https://merchantnegotiators.com/reviews/authorize-net-merchant-services/#CONTRACT) of the “fine print” of their services agreement.

**PayPal**

The name “PayPal” is synonymous with online payments because they spearheaded the movement back in the late 90s – and they’re still going strong today. As mentioned above, they’ve acquired Braintree and now have that and Venmo under their belt. PayPal has also since separated from eBay, so they are one powerful and progressive entity on their own.

PayPal is a great alternative or “back up” solution to any other gateway solution you may have on your site. You can, of course, use it as your sole solution, but many brands have it as an alternative choice at checkout. Why? It’s a time saver and an alternative to people who do not wish to dole out their credit card info to every retailer they are purchasing from.

With over 165 million users it’s definitely a trusted platform, and chances are a good portion of your demographic has a PayPal account. This could be a good “backup” gateway for you to implement and do some A/B testing on your checkout experience. It could be the difference in making or losing a sale.

Supported Platforms: ALL. Since PayPal usually redirects to its own site, no platform integration is necessary. If you want to integrate with PayPal Express, the redirect is skipped entirely and the necessary information is provided by the Express API.

Processing Rates

* 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (with option for volume discounts)
* 3.9% + fixed fee per international transaction
* Additional add-ons may require other fees
* See all pricing details [here] (https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees)

Contract

Paypal does not have a contract obligation and you can cancel at any time. You do have to comply with the PayPal user agreement which you can read in full [here] (https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full).

Clients: You can see an exhaustive list of PayPal’s store directory [here] (https://shopping.paypal.com/stores/?pagenum=1&amp;conversationId=2287477).

**Amazon Payments**

Amazon Payments launched in 2007 with the goal of providing users the same checkout experience they recieve from Amazon.com on other sites. Like PayPal, your customers’ transaction(s) can be conducted through Amazon Payments without leaving your website (conducted “inline”).

A plus about Amazon Payments is that your customers can have access to their 1-click shipping options, which is a feature of the Amazon.com checkout that highly increases conversions. If your customer base shops on Amazon, introducing this feature could greatly speed up your checkout process and, therefore, increase conversions.

Supported Platforms: Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce, Volusion (see other integrations [here] (https://payments.amazon.com/solutionproviders) )

Processing Rates

* 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
* No setup fee
* No fraud protection fees
* $20 chargeback fee
* See all pricing details [here] (https://payments.amazon.com/help/201212280)

Contracts

Amazon Payments does not operate on a contract and you can cancel your account anytime. Read more about cancellation [here] (https://payments.amazon.com/help/201595110).

Clients: Patagonia, Jockey, Honest.Co, Blick, and more

**Orbital Payment Gateway by Chase Paymentech**

Chase is quite a big name to be moving in the payment gateway space. Naturally, it comes with pros and cons. One of the pros of choosing Orbital Gateway as your solution is that you may be able to get a much lower processing rate than offered by any company listed here (more on that below).

The main con stems from dealing with such a large entity. When companies are this large, they have problems maintaining customer service and providing a high quality product. Don’t expect the level of customer service from Chase that you’d get from PayPal. So, the processing rate is attractive, but it comes at a cost. Additionally, reviews of this gateway show that Orbital is very good at tailoring their pricing to the business versus a flat-rate for all types. If you are looking to lower your cost on processing rates, Orbital may be the right solution for you.

This solution has, however, racked up a lot of [negative reviews] (http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/chase-paymentech-review/).

Supported Platforms: Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce

Processing Rates

* 1.65% + $.25 per transaction with your existing equipment
* $9.95 monthly fee
* See all pricing details [here] (https://www.chasepaymentech.com/virtual_terminal.html#_self)

Contract

Orbital Gateway has now moved away from a contract agreement (though if you purchase through a reseller you may still encounter this) and is now on a monthly model. However, if you sign up to receive equipment from Orbital, you will probably encounter a 24-month service agreement. 

**World Pay**

Another one of the original online payment providers, WorldPay started processing online payments in 1994. They are a global solution and have over 150,000 clients in the U.S. alone. However, because they are such a large company their customer service suffers.

Additionally, there may be some cancellation fees depending on what your WorldPay rep sets you up with in the beginning (more on that below). WorldPay is attractive in its lower rates, but it seems to be laced with fees and charges. Like Orbital, if you are looking for a lower processing rate, this gateway could be the right solution for you – but it’s going to come with a tradeoff. Overall, this solution seems outdated in both interface and pricing model. Our advice would be to read as many reviews as possible before using this solution.

Supported Platforms: BigCommerce, Magento, Spree Commerce, Shopify, WooCommerce

Processing Rates

* Signature debit transactions at 0.99%
* Standard credit transactions at 1.99%
* Rewards credit transactions at 2.6%
* Corporate/T&amp;E/Keyed-In credit transactions at 3.30%
* $0.20 per-transaction fee
* All of this is on a “limited offer”
* PCI compliance fee
* Chargeback fees

Contract

With WorldPay, you have a contract of 3 years. Should you choose to cancel early, your fees can be anywhere from $95 – $295. You can read more about their contracts and cancellation fees here, and also take a look at the actual [Terms &amp; Conditions] (http://support.worldpay.com/support/index.php?page=tandc) on their site.

ecommerce,International Stores Want to Sell My Product!,"Hi Everyone,

I've got a unique product that I'm selling solely on the US Amazon store through the FBA program.  All of my inventory is in their warehouse, so I don't have any to ship out from my location. The inventory (about 400 left of 500) was my first order from my supplier.  Like many other businesses, my product is manufactured in China, so I order it large quantities to justify the shipping cost.

I've had a few stores in the UK and Germany inquire about product samples and distributing my product in their own brick and mortar stores (possibly online as well). Shipping from the US to those countries is quite expensive and my product did not qualify from Amazon FBA Global Export, which would allow my product to be purchased by international customers via the Amazon US store.

I've thought about having Amazon ship me some units back, but that would add to the product cost per unit.

What would you guys do in my situation?",5,4,2016-02-24,ECOM,0.01754344440996647,0.7675435543060303,0.2149130254983902

What are the pros and cons of these? I shirk at the idea of setting up a warehouse with employees but I'd do it if it made sense.

Starting out I'm just using a garage and my own website. I like the control that gives you but I can see it getting out of hand quickly. How would you make a decision? 

I've heard of Amazon FBA multi-channel but I don't know much about it. And I'm not sure how hard it would be to integrate into a woocommerce site.",10,7,2016-02-27,ECOM,0.01661287061870098,0.9136866331100464,0.06970047205686569

shopify,App to build your own product,"Is there an app out there that allows customers to build their own item out of lots of options? We are starting a store where people can select what goes into their book. Visual photos of the products.  Its less like a T-shirt store where you upload your images, and more where you pick the photos you want to include in a book.

Anyone familiar with an app that does anything like that? I have seen some of the options apps, but they are made more for selection options like Large, Medium, Small.  They don't really give you a way to build your own product from dozens or hundreds of available options, including what you want.

ecommerce,"Managing 20,000+ SKUs offline in OS X [x-post /r/magento]","*tl;dr -- what to use to manage 20,000+ SKUs on Mac OS X?*

I'm setting up a new Magento where the supplier has a SKU list of 20,000+ lines. There are ~100 actual products, but each has different pricing tiers based on a vertical (corporate, charity, government), and each of those has tiered pricing for the number of users (1-10, 11-24, 25-49 etc).

In the first tab of my spreadsheet I have the master spreadsheet. The second tab is my Magento-ready spreadsheet which refers to info in the master sheet. I spit out the Magento sheet to CSV, import and 20,000+ lines get sucked in without issue.

I'm on a Mac and I'm using Numbers. Management of this SKU list will be ongoing. My Magento spreadsheet has 1.2 million cells. The original has 327k cells. That's &gt;1.5 million cells overall. Numbers clearly wasn't designed with this use case in mind, and it shows. Numbers is currently using 12GB out of 32GB, and that'll go higher over the day. Saves take 20 seconds, exports take about the same time before the _Export as_ dialog appears.

I have FileMaker for another project, and I really don't get on with the workflow and GUI quirks. I tried (and failed) with FileMaker to manage Magento data, and before I try something else I figured you folks might know of another tool to manage datasets of this size.

Suggestions and advice very appreciated. Thank you.",5,2,2016-02-29,ECOM,0.03347276896238327,0.9320253133773804,0.03450194373726845
