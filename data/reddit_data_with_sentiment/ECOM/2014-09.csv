I've opened an ecommerce store a couple of months ago, and I've been seeing the ""email subscription landing page"" trend recently developing. It used to be that only ""deal sites"" (like Gilt or Groupon) or service sites asked for email addresses in order for you to be able to see their products. Now, regular stores are doing it too.

What do you think of this?

1) All the guides say I should have a website set up and already selling products to show suppliers when I approach them. If this is the absoloute first time I'm doing this, how is that possible. All I have is a website with an empty products page. Do we make up fake products to just buffer it out for the time being? 

2) How do we deal with shipping costs? I found a supplier that's selling a product for $7.50 each, however the shipping is up to $17!.He claims that he can ship 3 of them for that $17.  My ebay competition is pricing the product at $19 with free shipping. 

How likely are they to have 'special' shipping terms for distributors? Is there some kind of service I can buy to buy in bulk and hold the product for me? (But that would mean I pay two shipping fees one to my holding facility, and one to the customer which again makes me uncompetitive.)",3,5,2014-09-03,ECOM,0.033627983182668686,0.9272233247756958,0.03914867714047432

I've been using Shopify for over a year now with my first online store (40 ref). Everything is normal, sales are good and I consider myself a fair user as I've allways manage to do things.

I'm starting my second business but with a much bigger product base with around 500+ ref and growing (It help to know that its replacement parts for electronic equipments), but i'm getting pretty frustrated on the way i can index products and I need some help.

I've got 3 types of categorization:
The brand/model the part is for (I using the Vendors for this)
Type of product - replacement parts or acessories (I'm using Collections for this)
Type of sub-product (like replacement cloths, etc) - I'm thinking I can use the product type for this

Am I right using this scheme? I want the user to be able to select all 3 ""categories"" but I'm not sure if I can make all 3 apear.

Can someone be helpfull?

I'm guessing schools, municipal buildings... and she even told me her last order was for bottled water and the order was for $150,000 worth of the bottled water.  I flippantly asked her if she was authorized to purchase from anybody she wanted and if I started my own wholesale company would she order through me?  She said as long as I can match or beat the price of who's she's been dealing with absolutely yes!  She did tell me that such high volume orders are hard to fill.  I contacted Worldwide Brands who immediately told me that they were no good for what I need.  Basically, I'm looking for a high volume drop shipper that can handle high volume orders that I can mark up a little to gain my friend as an account.

shopify,Managing processes in subscription based business with Shopify,"I'm trying to figure out out how to manage internal processes within Shopify. I have the subscription part figured out but I want to manage internal processes/customer inventory.

Here's the process I'm trying to accomplish

1) Customer signs up for service with Shopify, activates subscription. Customer chooses modifiers.

2) Our drivers pickup order from customer and scan it into our inventory. Customer's items are added to internal queue with customer's profile(modifiers chosen through website)

3) We process customer's order. Scan it into system as completed and ready for delivery.

4) Customer's order is dropped off. Scanned into system as released

Are there any apps where we can accomplish this? 

I found Assembler, but I was hoping to find a second option or maybe a second opinion.

shopify,Looking for help with some shipping settings,"Hello Shopifying Redditors - I'm putting the final touches on my company's new online store and have run into a problem that no Shopify live chat expert nor anyone at ShipStation has been able to solve. Hoping someone here can help me out.

We sell a few different types of items, mainly screenprinted concert posters, t-shirts, and sticker packs. Posters are rolled and shipped in cardboard tubes, t-shirts and sticker packs are shipped in poly bags or paper envelopes. We have carrier-calculated shipping with USPS and UPS and have specified weights for each product based on their total weight with packing materials.

We're having trouble telling Shopify to combine items to ship them together. For example, if someone orders 3 posters, we can ship those in one tube, not 3 tubes. If someone orders 2 posters and a sticker pack, we can ship those together in the same tube.

On our current online store, built with Ubercart, we are able to specify, on each product's page, how many of that item can be packed together in one package. Shopify doesn't offer this option and we'd love to find a workaround. Can anyone recommend an app or a trick to help us combine items so we can save our customers money on shipping?

Is there a simple way to do this? Prestashop doesn't seem to accept orders imports or anything. Braintree has mobile payment processing but I'm not sure if that would do the trick.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",2,4,2014-09-18,ECOM,0.011739098466932774,0.8398256897926331,0.14843523502349854

shopify,Shopify's mysterious order of checkout screens with PayPal scaring away customers?,"Hey guys, I notice my store has a VERY large number of people going to checkout with items in their cart, then stopping there. One bit of feedback I got from a customer was that it was ""a little scary"" when routing to PayPal because it doesn't tell you the total cost before going there and she assumed it might be charging her before she knew the total price. 

To elaborate; when you add items then proceed to your cart and click checkout, it automatically brings you to Paypal (we only accept Paypal as our payment gateway). At Paypal it'll tell you say ""$24.00"" for the t-shirt. However it doesn't talk about shipping or anything, it just wants your Paypal login or credit card info. People don't realize this will route back to our store for you to confirm everything. So it's a bit mysterious. Is there a way to make Paypal be the final step in this? Meaning, you see your total, eg. $24.00 subtotal, $2.20 tax, $5.95 shipping, $32.15 total, followed by a ""proceed to Paypal"" button (we have flatrate shipping so there shouldn't be any variables there). 

Or does anyone have recommendations for a PayPal only checkout process so customers don't lose confidence or build skepticism as we aren't a huge reputable brand (yet)?. This has actually been mentioned a few times by customers who didn't proceed, and some who did proceed. I just don't want something as silly as this to stop my dreams of retiring in a castle. ;-)


Please let me know if I need to explain this further!

ecommerce,Trying to literally host on Wordpress. Sell on Amazon. Please Help Me!,"Hi,
Earlier this year I had a horrible experience with a website that was hosted on Ipage. My site got infected. 

Now, I am launching a brand new company and will be selling a product that I have invented. I want to sell my product on Amazon, Ebay, etc.

But because of my horrible experience earlier this year I just want to have a basic (but nice looking) website that is literally hosted on Wordpress and redirects visitors to my Amazon page to purchase.

I've already bought my domain from Wordpress and I've spent $2000 on pictures. But I need a really nice theme that I can put my pictures into. 

This is what I basically want on my website:

1. A beautiful header 
2. A place to put a Youtube video tutorial
3. A place to show the ONE product that I will sell--- and dedicate a few lines to sum up with the product is.
4. Link to Amazon, Ebay, wherever I may sell it online
5. A blog where I can update with more pictures of people wearing the product
6. Social media links
6. Maybe a place to put more pictures.

I've checked out ThemeForest.net but I'm still pretty lost--- can I add my own pictures?  

Some background:
In one month I raised over $40000 in sells through crowd funding (throw away account, trying to remain anonymous for business). I've gained over 20,000 social media followers (between my Facebook and Instagram). I'm still getting requests for orders but I can't accept them right now because my focus is getting my Kickstarter orders in (from China) and sent out. Of course I invested money in my company to buy inventory to sell at regular price so I am hoping to gross close to $100000 in my first month on Amazon.",0,1,2014-09-18,ECOM,0.028185641393065453,0.9313733577728271,0.040441013872623444

ecommerce,How Bad Performance Impacts Ecommerce Sales (Part I),"As we approach the critical holiday period – where as much as 18% of shopping carts are abandoned due to slow websites – it’s time to discuss how bad performance can impact e-commerce sales and provide you with real-world examples and practical steps on how to improve performance.

**Why is website performance important?**

A decade ago, the number of businesses selling online was relatively low. Nowadays, those that don’t sell online are a dwindling minority. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the Internet in our modern day life, the marketplace for online sales is huge, and so is the amount of competition.

Consumers are spoilt for choice and aren’t afraid to shop around. Serve up a sluggish website, and visitors will go elsewhere without hesitation. A slow e-commerce website means you’ll lose individual sales as well as any repeat business that may have come from those initial sales.

Load Impact did a study on this in 2012 and found 53% of e-commerce site owners lost money or visitors due to poor performance or stability on their site.

That’s the important point here. If you’re looking to grow a business through online sales, a badly performing website will not only hinder short-term sales, but it will seriously hurt your chances of long-term growth.

There are statistics to back this up. The correlation between website speed and conversion rates / revenue has often been documented internally within organizations. I have seen this first hand for several of my e-commerce clients. The positive impact of a fast website can be dramatic, even for the relatively small online retailers.

When it comes to the giants of online retail, you get to appreciate how massive an impact website speed can have. All the way back in 2006, Amazon evidently reported that a 100-millisecond increase in page speed translated to a 1% increase in its revenue. (source)

Former Amazon employee Greg Linden also alluded to this on his blog:

“In A/B tests, we tried delaying the page in increments of 100 milliseconds and found that even very small delays would result in substantial and costly drops in revenue.”

**Avoid misdiagnosis by measuring**

As we’ve already established, speed is a critical part of website usability and it differentiates the average businesses from the great businesses. A common problem for small and medium sized businesses is a lack of awareness around website performance and what an important factor it is.

It is easy to assume that a website is performing acceptably because it is bringing in sales. If a website isn’t bringing in any sales, it can be easy to assume that it needs a re-design or simply more traffic needs to be driven to it. These are dangerous assumptions to make without any evidence to back them up.

So how do you get the evidence you need? Measure, measure, measure! Sound like too much hard work? Consider the risks of not measuring:

*Bad customer experience = bad reputation.
*You may spend a significant budget on re-designing your website because “it’s not working” when actually all it needed was a performance audit.
*You may increase your Pay Per Click (PPC) advertising budget to push more traffic to the website, but this just creates disgruntled visitors instead of happy customers. Indeed, this would equate to pouring money into the proverbial “leaky bucket”. Worse than that though, the more money you spend, the more disgruntled visitors you create!

**How to measure website performance**

For those new to the concept of performance monitoring, measuring the speed of a website may seem a lot simpler than it is.

The seemingly obvious way to measure how quickly a website is loading is to ping the homepage and… well… see how long it takes to load! If it loads in 3 seconds, great. If it loads in 10 seconds, not so great.

While that incredibly simple test is a good indicator in itself, it doesn’t come near to giving a complete picture of your website performance. There are many factors you need to consider if you want to get a true measurement of a website’s speed. Here are just a few:

*Site-wide performance - The homepage is just one page. Testing how quickly the homepage loads ignores the rest of the website which could perform completely differently
*Performance under load – if your website performs fine with 2 concurrent users, but then falls over with 10 concurrent users, you have a problem.
*Geographical location – The website may perform acceptably from some countries, but not for others. A test from a single location doesn’t reveal the website’s performance from different locations around the world.
*Real user behavior – real users behave differently. Some will land on a page and then leave immediately (known as a “bounce”), some will land on the website and visit several pages looking for information, some will submit a contact form or complete a checkout process if the website sells products online. In short, the best measure of a website’s performance is when it is under user load that is representative of real world scenarios.

So the best load tests comprise of multiple pages being tested, multiple concurrent virtual users who behave in different manners and originate from multiple geographical locations in the world.

But how do you decide what type of user scenarios to setup? i.e. what kind of user behavior do you want to mimic? This is where website traffic statistics come in useful. Tools such as Google Analytics will show you how your current visitors behave.

If you have a 10% conversion rate on your contact form page, then it would make sense to create a user scenario that mimics this and have 10% of your generated load use this scenario. Understand your current audience, and build up a set of user scenarios that are representative of their behavior, broadly speaking.

Understanding the technical terminology is an important first step before trying to setup your own load tests as well.

Load Impact provides a handy resource that will help you get your head around terms such as “ramping up”, “ramping down”, “virtual users”, “accumulated load time”, “load test execution plan”, “user scenarios” etc..",1,3,2014-09-19,ECOM,0.12331457622349262,0.8363906145095825,0.04029481112957001

ecommerce,Loomkart l Premium Home finishing,"www.Loomkart.com, a website for home furnishing fabric, has entered the online market with an endeavor to reduce the gap between the weaver and his loom and the end consumer. By removing the middlemen, Loomkart intends to bring high quality and fashionable home furnishing fabric to its customers. By working with weavers directly, we ensure that these weavers get substantial support in terms of finance, marketing and product development. 
Loomkart manufactures most of the products displayed on its website and hence, it can bring high quality products to its customers with a not so high price tag. Some of the products Loomkart has recently introduced are bed sheets,  bed covers, blankets, curtains, towels, mats, runners, cushion covers, rugs and durries; each of these products are quality tested and only then shipped to customers.
The team at Loomkart is passionate about tying up two goals i.e. to manufacture high quality innovative products while ensuring that they are more affordable for customers. 
It has also introduced a brand “Avioni Home” which again will be having a huge variety of home furnishing fabrics including curtains and cushion covers; soon Avioni will also be launching its line of rugs and bed sheets.  Avioni again is making an effort to be synonymous with quality; for example, cushion covers manufactured under Avioni brand have high quality zippers and interlocking and still the pricing is below similar products in the market. Another product which Avioni has recently launched is an 80% wool blanket in three different colors; these blankets are priced much lesser than other similar branded blankets; these blankets are a perfect gift to give out to loved ones especially during Diwali, Christmas and wedding. 
MSF is another brand of Loomkart in woolen blankets. Through MSF brand we are trying to provide good quality wool blankets in a lower price range, so that you can welcome a winter with warmth!
As its model is to provide best quality at lower price ranges, Loomkart at present is not offering COD, as the cost of COD returns increases the overall cost for other buyers also. But, if in future, we will feel that our valuable customers want COD, we will surely go for this option.
Loomkart, though a new kid on the block, has been well accepted by customers including those who want to buy wholesale products; for this, Loomkart has created a separate section in its menu under “wholesale zone”; here customers can request a wholesale quote for the products they like. 
The website comes with a complete guarantee; it has a Non Question Asked return policy; in case if you buy a product and your spouse does not like it, you can return the product with no questions asked; Loomkart values each and every customer and would want to ensure 100% satisfaction for its products.
Loomkart is also trying to be in front of innovation in terms of its products; it will soon be launching its range of reversible curtains.  For its Avioni brand, customers will soon have an option to order for customized lengths. It will also be soon launching high end 150 TC and 200 TC bed sheets in different contemporary designs. It will also be marketing upholstery products soon.
There are very good inaugural offers like up to 60% discounts on cushion covers, up to 45% off on bed-linen, up to 60% off on rugs and carpets and many more for customers including a 10% extra discount on purchase of any five Avioni products; this translates to more than around 70% savings. Separately, it is also giving 10% extra discount on purchase of more than Rs 999. 
Loomkart is trying to bring a subtle change to the home furnishing market place; Loomkart wants to ensure that high quality becomes affordable to all its customers.
Loomkart is also keen to support social causes; in case you are buying blankets from it for charity, it will ensure that you get a price with a special discount; the special discount is our way to support your charity; we have a wide range of blankets with prices starting from Rs 199 to up to Rs 1200 per blankets. If any customers have any other ideas on supporting charity in terms of cushions, bed sheets, curtains, rugs, Loomkart will be welcome to such ideas.",0,1,2014-09-27,ECOM,0.052463971078395844,0.915278971195221,0.03225705400109291

woocommerce,WooCommerce RTL Support,"A great number of WooCommerce-powered online stores aren't in English. We all know that WooCommerce community care about internationalization (i18n). Therefore, supporting RTL (right-to-left) alignment is quite necessary for languages like Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and many others.

For a while now, I've been working to add this support to WooCommerce, and I would like to show you how would a RTL WooCommerce store will look with and without RTL adjustments:

Without RTL adjustments (Original WooCommerce Plugin): http://drp.io/ail/cKc/-/-

With RTL adjustments (Modified WooCommerce Plugin): http://drp.io/aim/cKn/-/-

As you can see, the Original Plugin doesn't handle RTL alignment that well. It is messy and illogical for RTL readers.

Here are the steps I followed to make WooCommerce RTL-ready (After each update, ugh...):

    -Download the latest version and replace the old plugin folder with the new one.
    -Add a new folder in assets/css with the name “rtl” and copy all the .css stylesheets into it. (DON'T COPY 'chosen.css', LEAVE IT).
    -Configure CSS loaders to detect RTL language and load the needed stylesheets from assets/css/rtl via “isrtl” function.
    -Edit ""class-wc-admin-notices.php” and ""class-wc-admin-welcome.php” to load “rtl/activation.css”.
    -Edit ""class-wc-admin-assets.php” to load “rtl/admin.css”.
    -Edit ""class-wc-frontend-scripts.php” to load “rtl/prettyPhoto.css”.
    -Edit ""class-wc-admin-assets.php” to load “rtl/dashboard.css” &amp; “rtl/menu.css”.
    -Edit ""class-wc-frontend-scripts.php” and add an array to each .css file in “woocommerceenqueuestyles” with the name “rtlsrc” to load “rtl/{filename.}.css”.
    -Edit the “foreach” for the variable “$enqueuestyles” to load “rtlsrc” if the language is RTL in ""class-wc-frontend-scripts.php"".
    -RTL each .css file in “assets/css/rtl”.
    -Find and replace “../“ with “../../“ for all .css files in “css/rtl”.
    -Reverse “tabs” style to LTR.
    -Make “.productdimensions” and “.product_weight” classes “dir: ltr”.
    -Edit ""my-orders.php” file “text-align: left” to be RTL friendly.
    -Edit all .php files under “templates/emails” text-algin from “left” to “right” if is RTL.
    -Edit “includes/abstracts/abstract-wc-email.php” text-align from “left” to “right” if is RTL.
    -Load “chosen-rtl.js” to the fontend &amp; edit it so it work on the class “.chosen-container”.
    -Replace arrows between the classes "".wc-forward” and "".wc-backward” in “woocommerce.css”
    -Prettify “prettyPhoto.css” &amp; fix its arrows &amp; flip the “close” and “expand” buttons to be at a proper position.

(The steps above will add full RTL support to the dashboard, the front-end, and the email templates).

To try the RTL version of WooCommerce, download it now (2.2.4): http://cl.ly/4339150E3g35/download/woocommerce.zip

My point of all of this is to explain how RTL support is very important and should be integrated with the main plugin. It's really not that hard to add, and doesn't affect the plugin size what so ever.

ecommerce,E-Commerce: „Geprüfter Anbieter“ und Testsiegerwerbung - Was ist davon zu halten?,"Wie dürfen Siegel und Auszeichnungen verwendet werden? Rechtsanwalt Oliver Baustian klärt auf...

Immer häufiger findet man auf Online-Shopseiten den Hinweis, dass man es mit einem „geprüften Anbieter“ zu tun hat. Der Verbraucher versteht dann, dass er auf einer juristisch „sauberen“ Seite ist und der Verbraucherschutz garantiert wird. Dies ist offenbar manchen Gewerbetreibenden nicht bewusst. Wird mit dem Slogan „geprüfter Anbieter“ geworben, so darf der Verbraucher eine sorgfältige Überprüfung hinsichtlich des Anbieters und der Qualität der angebotenen Leistung anhand objektiver Kriterien erwarten. Das Landgericht Fulda hatte einen Fall zu entscheiden, bei dem der Online-Shop-Betreiber lediglich seine ordnungsgemäße Gewerbeanmeldung attestieren lassen hat. Andere Kriterien, z.B. die Verwendung zulässiger Allgemeiner Geschäftsbedingungen, transparenter Preisauszeichnung u.ä. hatte der Anbieter nicht überprüfen lassen, LG Fulda, Urteil vom 17.01.2014, Az. 7 O 16/14.

**Geprüfter Anbieter? Irreführung ist unzulässig**

Mit einem firmenfremden Siegel wird immer der Eindruck einer neutralen, an sachlichen Kriterien ausgerichteten Prüfung durch eine neutrale Instanz suggeriert, wie Rechtsanwalt Oliver Baustian von der Kanzlei Orth Kluth erklärt. *Die Verwendung von solchen frei erfundenen „Geprüfter Anbieter-Siegeln“ ist unzulässig,  da sie eine spürbare Irreführung des Verbrauchers verursachen,  wenn tatsächlich keine Überprüfung der Seite anhand objektiver Kriterien durch eine neutrale Stelle erfolgt ist.* Dem Betreiber des Online-Shops drohen Abmahnungen oder einstweilige Verfügungen wegen unlauterer Werbung von Mitbewerbern oder Verbraucherverbänden.

Das Urteil beanstandet außerdem die werbliche Unsitte, sich als Testsieger zu deklarieren, obwohl man als Unternehmen keinen Spitzenplatz bei dem Auswahlverfahren gewonnen hat. Das beklagte Unternehmen hatte  mit der Bezeichnung „Sieger“ geworben, obwohl es nur der zwölfte Platz in dem von neutraler Seite durchgeführten Wettbewerb belegt hatte. Unter „Sieger“ versteht der Verbraucher aber in der Regel immer nur den ersten, unter Umständen je nach Branche auch noch den zweiten oder dritten Platz, nicht jedoch den zwölften Platz. Will das Unternehmen in diesen Fällen trotzdem damit werben, dass es immerhin einen der oberen Plätze eingenommen hat, so empfiehlt sich die Bezeichnung „Ausgezeichneter Teilnehmer des Wettbewerbs XX“.  

 

Bei der Werbung mit der Testsiegerplakette ist darauf zu achten, dass der Verkehr nicht in die Irre geführt wird über die geographische Reichweite der verliehenen Auszeichnung. Rechtsanwalt Oliver Baustian weist darauf hin, dass Unternehmen gerne mal vergessen, ihre in einem regionalen Wettbewerb verliehene Auszeichnung überregional in der Außenwerbung einzusetzen, ohne in einem Sternchentext auf die geographische Begrenzung der Auszeichnung hinzuweisen. Ein solcher Hinweis ist nur dann entbehrlich, wenn die Firmierung des Unternehmens oder der Name der Auszeichnung bereits objektiv erkennbar auf eine räumliche Beschränkung der Auszeichnung für den Verkehr hinweisen.

ecommerce,Looking for custom clothing imaging software.,"Hi all,

I'm in the process of starting up a custom clothing store, and I am after a specific imaging program that I know will be invaluable.

I am after a program that will take a swatch of cloth and layer it over a blank shirt, making a digital image of a shirt made with that fabric.

Sorry if this has been asked and solved, I cannot find it for the life of me.

Thank you for your help in advance.
