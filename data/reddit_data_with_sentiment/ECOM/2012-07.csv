ecommerce,Human bridge from ERP to eCommerce platform....,"As a result of poor planning/fund allocation, my company has recently invested in a brand spankin' new JDEdwards ERP system but made no plans to integrate/bridge it with our (3) Magento eCom sites.   As a result, we've had to create a 'human bridge' in order to begin sending transactional email with any accuracy.   Meaning, a human runs a report and manually updates the Magento backend.   Slow, tedious work for sure. 

Anyone have any experience doing this?  Any other suggestions for smoothing this connection until they decided to spend money on a real bridge?",0,1,2012-07-02,ECOM,0.02395518869161606,0.9281406998634338,0.04790415242314339
ecommerce,"Freight, I've got to be overlooking something","I'm tasked with finding a new e-commerce platform for a company.  Of the many things we'd like to do (I'll summarize below) there seems to be a few that are really limiting our options.  I'm looking for both advice on narrowing the field down vs adding capability to a platform or for suggestions on a particular solution to use.

Constraints:
We have 2 stores, 1 with about 4,500 products another with 1,500.
Most of the products need to be sold in groups, have add-ons, refills or consumables that go with them. We know mobile is the future and are looking at building some tools to help our customers in purchasing qty + selection.  We are a brick and mortar location and do rental work so our internal system choices are a bit limited as well as thats the primary focus of one of the businesses (rental).  We are switching platforms for managing this as well but the new vendor we're really leaning towards has nothing in the way of API open yet, and their re-code is a few months from completion.  A lot of our products need to be shipped freight as they may weigh hundreds of pounds. Current providers: Freightquote.com and CHrobinson.com

Solutions I've been reviewing (no particular order):
Self Hosted and Hosted:
Amazon Webstore
Magento
BigCommerce
Volusion
Shopify (not made to handle a store this size)
3dCart
ZenCart
Americart
PinnacleCart

Assistance with getting freight pricing at time of sale seems to be an out of the box experience with all of these vendors.  I have found:

http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/ups-freight.html
http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/freightquote-com-shipping-module.html

but have had less luck for the other platforms.

For stores of our size and the features we wish to provide is there someone else we should be looking at? Is Magento as good a fit as we'll find?

Budget: $$$
Store Size: 1:4500 SKU 2:1500 SKU

Additional Info:

Short list of our needs (I am working on a more developed description in our needs from a potential API):
Inventory (POS / Rental) &lt;-&gt; Online Store - Ability to custom develop a solution.
Quote / Pricing information from POS -&gt; Website
Quote Requests / Purchases to modify inventory levels -&gt; POS
Product catalog (POS / Rental System) &lt;-&gt; Website (Item name, weight, dimensions, description, options) - This may be too complex with options / variations. 
Customer based price books?


Shopping Cart:
Pull Freight prices / best price match (working on getting contacts with freight providers for you)
Simliar items (people who viewed bought...)
Addon's Extras for viewed product
Product Groups (buy X, Y, Z together and save!)
State tax / Sales tax handled properly
Proper shipping rate calculations
Control over featured product pages (coincide with other marketing efforts, spotlight product / full css/html design ability)
Schedule deals, spotlights, promotions
Deal of the Day
Coupons, perferred customers, discount categories (10% off equipment, 15% off consumables etc)
Item Filtering by category, item qualities, attributes
Product Video, Galleries
Feedback/ Reviews
Web tools to assist with job costing / calculators 

Customized flow to site to follow job progression, requires style / look changes per department.

Back End:
Back end for customers with resources, documentation, help and support tools
Current Balance / Invoices
Customer notifications / Account information / Tracking Info
Saved Carts / Wishlist like purchases

I still don't know whether it is wise, considering potential duplicate penalties in Google, but I decided to ask: What is your opinion? Do you feel like this is a good strategy? How do you feel your customers would react? Google?

Benefits:

1. More products
2. More SEO potential with more pages
3. Keeping customer on site longer by viewing more products

Magento seems to have the most features by far, but I'm always looking for hidden view files or trying to find XML options that are not in the base theme (so I spend time on their forums looking for someone that had to find the same thing). The site I'm working with is low budget but has several thousand products, and the guy is always wanting to add new features. With that said, Magento is not turning out the be the best option.

I was suggested Lemon Stand and OpenCart by some other developers which I looked into (I want to stick with PHP). I need multi-site capabilities so Lemon Stand is out of the question. OpenCart looks to be nice, but their documentation is horrible. I have a long term contract with the website so I will be spending a lot of time putting in my own customizations.

I've been researching like crazy and it seems like every site I go to recommends OSCommerce and ZenCart. As soon as people start agreeing with the suggestion I go and find a different website, those are two terrible options I've had to deal with in the past.

july the 14th -Atlanta businesses can improve their website traffic with the help of professional SEO services. This is according to the local [SEO experts](http://vayumedia.com) at Vayu Media.

The company provides locally oriented search engine optimization services that focus on providing better experiences for web visitors. This often involves speeding up page load times, getting rid of unnecessary media elements, and adding pages that Atlanta web users will likely request.

""Our goal is to act as an effective SEO service that actually adds value to our clients' pages,"" said a representative of Vayu Media. ""We want to give our clients long-term results, and the best way to do that is to impress their audiences.""

Many of Vayu Media's clients appreciate the benefits of using a local [Atlanta SEO company](http://vayumedia.com) Vayu Media creates pages that appeal specifically to Atlanta web users.

I would like to find a manufacturer to make a novelty item that requires the assembly of two relatively small and simple items (e.g. LED light + key, glue light to key, create lightkey, no this is not the product). I've done some research on alibaba.com and other mfg sites and it appears both items can be manufactured, but I am unsure if I will be able to find a manufacturer who can assemble both with the quality I am looking for.

My background is in finance, so setting up an LLC and online store should be relatively simple... but I would prefer to arrange a dropship contract with the manufacturer so that the product can ship at point of sale to avoid the whole inventory problem. But most dropshippers have set items that sellers can buy/sell at wholesale prices. Not sure on order amounts yet, but would like quotes on 100, 500, 1000, etc.

ecommerce,Can anyone recommend a good Web-based shopping cart?,"I just want the cart portion for my existing site ([mellowmonk.com](http://www.mellowmonk.com/)). 

I tried 3dCart for about 1 day -- they want to rope you into their all-in-one services and don't make it obvious how to integrate their cart functionality with an existing site (if it's possible at all). Volusion seems the same.

OpenCart and ZenCart are out as I'd rather have a Web-based cart. (I currently use Mal's eCommerce.)

Some carts are slick looking and easy to use but don't have advanced functionality, such as free shipping for domestic (U.S.) orders only.

I'd appreciate hearing your advice on this. Thanks!",0,1,2012-07-28,ECOM,0.01533168088644743,0.9123979806900024,0.07227029651403427

ecommerce,Would a e-commerce site with no prices listed put you off? or would you consider phoning the company?,"I run an e-commerce site that has always done extremely well by not listing the RRP of our products, essentially trying to get a potential customer to phone us  so we can actually talk to them, negotiate, close the sale etc.

Recently though out competition has increases massively, and business is down. 

They all list the same product with prices, do you think that the business model on the site I run is now outdated? or do you think any serious enquiry would make the effort to contact us by email or phone?",0,1,2012-07-30,ECOM,0.015425863675773144,0.879594624042511,0.10497943311929703
