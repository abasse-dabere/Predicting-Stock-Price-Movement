ecommerce,Opinions / advice for my e-commerce startup name please,"Hi guys, I am digging deep and hoping to open up an e-shop selling high quality leather strapped SnapBack's (for those who aren't familiar, SnapBack is a style of hat, just have a google you will probably recognise). Since my last name is Redenbach, I was thinking of calling it SnapBach. However I am having alot of trouble with the capitalization of certain letters, whether I should change the a in Bach to an Ä and how that will effect marketing (german background, however Australian base.), and even thinking of just switching it to BÄCHsnaps or something like that. Here are a few examples I am tossing up between: SnapBach SnapBäch snapBACH SnapBACH SnapBÄCH BächSnaps BÄCHsnap BÄCHSnaps BACHSnaps Anyways I think you get the idea of what I'm on about.

woocommerce,Update to the registration bots autoban topic I posted a few days ago,"It's funny, but my previous topic where I asked about the solution for my WooCommerce site registration bots infestation was removed by /r/WooCommerce automoderator bot. This is what the original text was saying:

&gt;&gt;By default, WooCommerce register new customers with the username which is equal to the user's email username (the part before @). Is there a way to autoban or autodelete users who do not follow this rule, because they are obviously just dumb bots?

The only suggestion was to use CAPTCHA. But it is against my personal believes.

So I tried another way. I just blacklisted `/wp-login.php` URL in Wordfence. It stopped the attack. I can see WF is already blocking those bots (they are all using Tor exit nodes). 

I also tested the most common customer registration paths in another browser through the VPN, and it haven't blocked the IP of a normally behaving user, since the customer registration is supposed to happen at `/checkout` or `/my-account`.

Is there any way this quick fix can bite me later? Does WooCommerce rely on `/wp-login.php` URL somewhere?",2,3,2017-04-01,ECOM,0.07479540258646011,0.9019443392753601,0.023260295391082764

ecommerce,"3 months since I started my Shopify store, 65 sales, $2.5k revenue, still $1k in the hole. How can I improve?","Hello everyone!

Hoping to get a bit of feedback on my store and how I can improve. To begin, my company name is [The Market of Life](https://marketoflife.com/). I started my store January 1st and have had a good amount of success but have spent a lot of money on advertisements. As you can see from the title, I've made around $2,500 in sales but I'm still around $1,000 in the hole. 

I have been mostly using Facebook ads because I've seen the most success from those. I'm spending around $0.25 to $0.45 cost per content view varying my daily spend from $15-$30. 

I've been using some Shopify apps that I feel have helped as well. I am drop shipping from Aliexpress so Oberlo is definitely the most important. Others are Retarget, Consistent Cart, Checkout boost, and Soundest. 

I've been working with my SEO on the site to try to get it to show up organically more often but haven't had any luck thus far. 

I guess my question is, am I missing anything here that is vital to my success and that could possibly cut some costs (particularly advertising costs or making SEO more viable). 

If anybody has any further feedback I'm all ears. Thanks!",10,9,2017-04-03,ECOM,0.022463254630565643,0.9018672108650208,0.07566948980093002

shopify,My theme development app for Shopify,"Hi Shopifolk,

I spoke with quite a few users here back about my app in development in November/December, and now I'm back with an update! ([You may remember me from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/5febut/im_giving_free_help_no_sales_pitches_or_upselling/))

My app is coming along well and I'd like to start hearing from people who intend to use it. First, here's the concept:

**Manages all templates in your shop**

This app is for designing and managing the front page and all product/collection pages within your site.

**Separates layout from design**

Themes force you to compromise between the layout you want and the design elements you like, but my app separates the two. So you can definitely have both the arrangements you like and fonts, colors and spacing you want.

**Based on blocks and containers**

The core concept is to arrange blocks on a page, which contain your products, collections and other items.

Aaaand, here are some still and moving pictures for you

- [Composing an image gallery](https://gfycat.com/DazzlingWellinformedCurassow)

At this point, the app is very close to being usable for beta testers. I'm planning a paid beta trial starting May 1, and I'm looking for a small number of users (maximum 10). It will be $30/mo to participate, and you and I will be working closely over email and video, each week, to get your shop in the shape you want.

If you're that kind of adventurous, fearless soul known as the Beta Tester, and you want to take direct control of your shop's layout and style, let's talk! Leave a comment below or send me a PM and let's get in touch.

All feedback welcome, leave a comment and let me know what you think.",11,5,2017-04-03,ECOM,0.02726474031805992,0.938592255115509,0.03414304181933403

I was hired (as a full-time employee) to replace an ecommerce manager (outside consultant) whose duties have ceased on Saturday. Since I have to give my 2 weeks at my current job, I’m going to be starting a couple of weeks from now.
 According to my new boss, the site is supposed to go live today, but I’m still out of the loop as to what has been set up, and what’s going on. When I first got the job offer last week I asked if I could meet the current ecom manager for the transition, but the new boss said he can’t set anything up because he’s out of the country.

They did ask me if I could work part-time before my official start date to fill in the gap, but today they told me (along with the official offer letter) that my boss will be out of the country again and will only return a couple of days before my start date, so they won’t be able to have me do any work until I officially start.

The site is supposed to go live today, and I don’t know who’s managing it because there’s nobody with relevant experience working full-time at the company. I already pressed them for me to meet the person I’m replacing, but they seem to think it’s unnecessary at the moment.

4 years ago we started an eCom store selling male leggings.

We seen solid growth over the past few months and are now going for $100k per month during 2017.

And guess what?

We're going to share everything on the journey... with you guys... on r/Shopify.

And guess what?

There is no high priced course to join, no low priced course to join, just pure, brutally real content... following the journey of an unlikely product to global domination.

It is going to be a story about building a long term sustainable brand, not about setting up a store, buying Facebooks ads then dropshipping some valentines day mugs.

This is real business, with a real brand that it's customers care about.

Anyway, this first video shares:

1. Who I am
2. What sTitch Leggings is (and how it started 4 years ago)
3. Why we are sharing everything on our journey to $100k per month

And moving forward I will cover everything we go through on the journey.

E.g.

- Facebook Ads
- Systems/outsourcing
- Building a team
- Next level customer service
- Getting into retail stores
- Working with influencers
- Managing suppliers/distributers

Really excited about growing on the journey and hopefully inspiring and maybe even educating other eCom store owners along the way :)

If anyone is interested in following the journey, here is the first video with a little introduction to me, sTitch and Sneez (the eCom tool sponsoring the journey):

woocommerce,Freight Issue,"We have three freight api's on our website. We tried putting in the classes for each product because we have certain products that are freight only and some that are ground sized but a big mixture of both are usually ordered. Every attempt we make to get accurate quotes fall through.

We have tested it against our logged in accounts and its always high. Our ground rates are dead on, but for some reason we cannot get in the ballpark with freight.

Two questions. 1. Would flat shipping zones be a smarter way to approach freight and end the nightmare of high rates? 2. What could possibly be making these freights go so high.

(Before answering, yes we have all the correct weights and measurements in the site and when we test we test to what the site has in the site for weight)

dropship,DO NOT USE DROPSHIPPING FOR EBAY!!!!!!!!,"Unless you have an online store that specifies extremely long shipping times which of course will lose you customers one way or another if you are upfront or not DO NOT BELIEVE THE DROPSHIP HYPE!! I just got fucking cornholed by my ""Genius"" Idea to list a bunch of aliexpress products on ebay thinking. My first FUCK UP was that I kept the item location as my address and not Fucking CHINA where the actual Item was. My second FUCK UP was that My behavior on aliexpress set off a red flag because I tried to use 2 different credit cards which put my account under review and this led to even longer shipping time. Long fucking story short, after thinking I was the drop ship WIZARD and after making a whopping $150 profit on 50 Sales. I bought a fucking nice bag of kush and was celebrating my small business victory only to realize which is actually pretty fucking obvious now that I think about it that this was the worst and probably one of the dumbest fucking things I ever did. What happens when you get 50 orders from EBAY. Well here is how it goes, 50 people order 50 different items from you, This equals about $1000 in gross income, thats before ebay fees, paypal fees and however much it costs you to buy it from the dropshipper. Now you, One by one Buy the items. and whatever you are left over with is yours right? nope, about 13% of that goes to ebay. Which is normal but its something I wanted to point out. Now, you have 50 Items on the way to your soon to be hostile customers. But Since I was not Upfront about where the shit was coming from, everyone was expecting the products in a few days. So what happens next? The first customer complains and opens a case, Ebay puts a hold on the funds in your paypal for the full fucking amount of that product say $50, Now another case is open and they put a hold on $25 and this continues until your paypal is in the negative. AND THEY TAKE THAT FROM YOUR BANK ACCOUNT!!!    So yes, and if thats not the worst part EBAY will refund the people and the items are still in transit, good luck getting that shit back. I just paid for a fat bitches Electric Cock Zapping Sex Toy in Kentucky and Im am not making any of that UP. Shes probably zapping dicks all day on my dollar. This is bullshit, and she is one of 49 more people. So at the end of it all, not only is that fucking $150 gone, I will probably end up paying for all this shit out of pocket and Its my girlfriends paypal account so FUCK MY LIFE FUCK US ALL TO HELL.

woocommerce,Product with variable options and quantities,"Currently working on a site for a client that has presented the following scenario:

Clients wants to feature 1 product in their store. It is a meal prep company that wants the 1 item in the store to be the meal itself.
They want 2 options for the meal plan, one for the client to customize their order and one for the company to make the order for the customer. There will be 3 drop downs with options for the customized option and just a message box for the company creates one. Now the tricky part is they want to have Protein Bars to be added to the meals but simply as an addon after the fact but they want customers to be able to choose a quantity for the protein bars. The issue I am forseeing is if a customer chooses multiple quanties of the meal plans while choosing quantities of the protein bars they will end up with an excess in bars. I'm not sure what method I should even begin to take with this. My only solution has been to make protein bars a second store item and adding some code to make the customer order a certain amount of meal plans no matter what before they are allowed to check out.

I wrote a guide on how to dropship from Aliexpress to Amazon, without going into detail here's a little excerpt from the guide.

This new dropshipping method utilizes a number of tools that allow you to list a large amount of products found on Aliexpress onto Amazon, meaning you can get a lot of traffic just because you have a lot of products listed, increasing your chances of selling a product, if you listed on Amazon manually it would take a considerably longer amount of time and you wouldn’t have additional functionality which I will talk about.

Aliexpress – Your inventory source

Shopify – This website will house your inventory and communicate with Amazon and 

Oberlo – This tool will allow you to import products from Aliexpress while keeping sync of stock, it will also load up the corresponding Aliexpress product page when you get an order which is an imperative feature as you will have hundreds of products that you won’t be able to keep track of manually.

Alibonus – This tool gives you cashback when making purchases on Aliexpress, there are couple tiers, starting at 7% going up to 10%, you can read in depth about it here

Keyword Tool Dominator – A neat little tool that allows you to peer into Amazon search data to optimize your listing keywords",10,9,2017-04-06,ECOM,0.05280096083879471,0.9240184426307678,0.02318059653043747

The way that I’ve set this up is that I’ve got two global attributes: Festival and Package Type.

The customer needs to be able to select one festival, and one package type. Then that tent is booked out for the festival, and cannot be booked by anyone else. But, it must still be able to be booked for another festival.

I'm brand new to ecommerce, etc. But i feel i've got a solid beginners understanding after doing thorough research.

I've been thinking about selling products on amazon and dropshipping them, but I'm having some trouble picking out products that could compete, as i know price competition is very tough there.

I've heard from a lot of people that it's best to steer clear of amazon and just set up a shopify for the first few months, and then move to my own site, do you guys think this is a solid idea?

It seems like a longer process and i worry that my products will turn out to just not be sellable after the shopify store is built.

I'm interested in donating a portion of my income to a charity that's related to my niche.

Donations will be taken out of a portion of the profit if that helps.  Second question is: Is there any easier way to set it up than just manually calculating with each sale?

(Starts Below)

There was silence for hours. We've been on the sea all day. We haven't caught 1 fish.

Then suddenly, out of nowhere, I felt a tug on my fishing line. It was so strong and I was in such utter disbelief at the fact that my line was moving, I almost forgot to reel the fish in. Then, the fish put up a fight, swimming wildly around in our fishing area for minutes. Fortunately, I was able to reel the fish in. I was so excited to enjoy my first catch, thinking of everything I could use this fish for. However, once I saw the ""fish"", to my shock, it was... your order.

I was the one to catch your order. And in my eyes, it was the catch-of-the-year. Your order was magnificent and special to me (and the whole crew). Queue the thunderous roars of applause and cheering. Everyone was so unbelievably happy; your order caused pandemonium (in a good way). Upon further inspection, it read ""Hi -----, your order has been confirmed and we're psyched to prepare your order and ship it out!""

woocommerce,Composite products/product bundles,"I really hope this makes sense.

I work for an industrial/hydraulic parts company. They've created this series of valves that have a whole lot of options on them. I'll try to write this out as best I can.

So there is a main valve that is basically the necessity, and what will be the main product, the hydraulic valve (black). With that, you have the option to chose one or more of these additional valves: Per-Acidic (orange), Chlorinated Water (light blue), Water (green), Hot Water (red), and Air (dark blue). You might want 5 of the orange, 2 of the green, and none of the others. Or you might want 3 of each. But let's stick with 5 orange and 2 green for this scenario.

So you go to the valves main page, which showcases the black valve. You scroll down and select the orange valve with 5 quantity, and the green valve with 2 quantity. I need under each color valve the ability to also select additional options: what size connection for Port A and what size connection for Port B. And be able to also select the quantity on those (because, if you order 5 orange you might want 3 to be one size and 2 to be another size). These size options will need to be under all the different valve colors.

I have composite products and product bundles plugins. What steps do I need to take to make this happen? If I need to provide some sort of visual I can. I'm sorry this is confusing... I'm pretty confused myself. Thanks!",1,5,2017-04-10,ECOM,0.03569037839770317,0.9253513813018799,0.03895828127861023

ecommerce,Help! I want to sell my products to the US/Can/Aus,"I have an online shop selling a product in the UK/EU - we are doing pretty well in the 1st few months of trading. We have a massive Instagram following and I'm doing ads on Facebook/Google AdWords and its slowly building - we are currently way above the average for a new eCommerce site in terms of sales. We get the odd customer from US/Can/Aus but its rare as our shipping is done with Royal Mail and the product has a low sale price (max is £15.99) so paying £10+ for shipping puts off those customers. We are getting maybe 5-10 abandoned carts a day from US customers who want the product but are quite obviously put off by the shipping cost.

What I want to do (correct me if this is NOT possible): I have tried to use a fulfillment company in the US, it works out extortionate and decimates my margin - and I don't want to lock up any inventory there. So I came up with a crazy idea that I could build a 'mirror' of my site that if US/CAN/Aus ip addresses logon they will see a version of the site that is applicable to them. I.e Only 1 product (as opposed to the 3 options they would currently have if viewing the UK site) - a different price shown in local currency including 'free' shipping - which essentially masks the amount its costing for shipping internationally (I'm on the fence of this being unethical but truly it's just to convert more sales psychologically) i.e if the product is $29.99 and includes free shipping they are more likely to purchase as opposed to paying £15.99 + £12.50 shipping. Items will be shipped from UK not fufilled in the US etc

dropship,Get 8% Cashback back using AliExpress API &amp; Oberlo,"I've been seeing a handful of posts about AliBonus and getting back 7% on COGs, but for those using Oberlo with Shopify, there is an extra 8% you may be missing out on. 

AliExpress has an affiliate program where you'll receive a unique link to share with others but also an API Key that can be integrated into your site. You can create your API Key here: https://portals.aliexpress.com/

Once AliExpress has generated an API key for you (1-2 days) you can then go to the Oberlo app and send them a message via their chat app. Simply ask them to ""activate the AliExpress API"" and voila! You will now see an area to input your API Key and Username directly into the app (Settings &gt; Suppliers &gt; bottom of the page)

SIDE NOTE:
For those that didn't know about this, just know that if you aren't using it, Oberlo is using their API Key to benefit off your hard work and sales. Last month they attempted to shut down access to this API feature by stating: 

""Hello, thepillowqueen!
Thanks so much for reaching out! Audrius here from Oberlo - happy to help!
Thank you for showing interest in joining AliExpress affiliate network. I would like to kindly inform you that Oberlo no longer provides integration services for this program. The decision is based on the fact that it generates a substantial amount of income, which is used to maintain and constantly improve Oberlo. Our main focus is smooth and effortless user experience by creating new features and making dropshipping easier than ever. Sadly, it would be out of reach without this contribution from our customers. I honestly hope you understand how important it is for us! If you disagree, I'm afraid I won't be able to offer you anything else but to consider using other dropshipping alternatives""

After arguing back and forth about how it isn't fair to benefit off of someone else's sales and that small businesses could really use this 8% to lower their COG's, they wouldn't budge. So with some quick thinking, we put our client sites to use by leaving approx. 15 1-Star reviews on the Shopify app store for Oberlo. Within 5 minutes of leaving the last review we received a message from them stating that they reinstated the program due to the backlash they received. You can thank us later ;)

EDIT: We have come to realization that you can't stack the AliBonus cashback with the AliExpress API with Oberlo since they conflict with each other. A user had commented with this issue and we also realized it when placing orders yesterday. There is an alternate extension that can be used to claim some extra cashback using the API called Honey. They give you a ""surprise"" amount of cashback ranging from 1-10%. Since they don't use an integrated API it will work stacked with AliExpress API. The only downside is that payouts are made via Amazon.com gift cards.",13,10,2017-04-12,ECOM,0.037962235510349274,0.930310845375061,0.03172696754336357

ecommerce,"Anyone using Stripe and Failed Order notifications, how often do you have failed order?","Hey everyone

I built my ecommerce site using Woocommerce. For a long time we were only accepting PayPal. About a month ago I also added Stripe. I have email notifications for every successful and failed order so I can see what's happening. I get occasional ""Order Failed"" email to see people trying purchasing with Stripe and their credit card declines. 

My products are about $250 - $300 each and sometimes people buy more than one, making the transaction over a $1000. 

Many of these people either buy it with another card or just use PayPal checkout. 

What I am wondering is whether these people just may not have credit line on that card thus getting declined, or some credit cards not liking a new vendor to charge hundreds of dollars on a transaction.

Anyone with experience?

woocommerce,What is the best method to always verify Woo is working properly on your website?,"Aside from checking the settings and external factors involved. One of the challenges I have is when there is an update involved either through with a plugin or Woo or Theme I always try my best to run through the ""Check-Out"" process to make sure everything works properly. Although sometimes just a plugin can break something.

I've been running some campaigns for a while and they were performing well, but I wasn't closing. I finally get a customer sending a message to my live chat saying there's an issue with checkout. I run through again in the morning and verify and fix is the issue. Offer them 10% off coupon and move on. It worries me that I might have lost some sales during that period of time.

How do most of you eCommerce sellers manage your websites on a daily basis? Do you pay someone for this position or do you have a method to check or an automation of some sort that verifies all the procedures from start to finish were generated successfully?

1. make a technically better product – better features, or it looks better. If it's a 'destination' site, it should have a better customer experience.
2. tell a better story – how GoPro beat Contour, how small toymakers etc compete against the big ones
3. use a better business model – direct-to-consumer, subscription boxes, etc
4. serve a subset of the market better – go hyper-specific and win over a smaller group by serving them better (eg ""cooking for programmers"")

ecommerce,How did fraudsters find me so quickly?,"Here’s the situation. Opened a webstore this week. Built on market press, using cybersource as our payment gateway. Passed PCI compliance audit just a week ago. This is a soft launch so we’re not advertising the webstore yet, just have the STORE button now sitting in our header and products have BUY NOW buttons. Have got a couple dozen orders, but a pattern has developed where I noticed orders for a QTY 3 for my most expensive item, coming in multiple times. While I’m sure customers would be interested in the item, that quantity is off and not practical. 

Looked into it further and found that every order uses a suspicious yahoo email, nothing near the customer name. all the billing addresses are at least a few hundred miles away from the shipping addresses. Called the phone numbers, all were disconnected but one. Etc. Basically, I’m convinced this is fraud. These appear to be stolen cards because the transactions pass through the gateway.

However, this is my question: what was it about my store that allowed these fraudsters to find it so quickly? I mean, these orders started within an hour or so of launching the store. While we hope to grow, we know that we’re a niche market (garden equipment), and so the market looking for us seems like it would be pretty specific.

dropship,"AliExpress Dropshipping, invoices and bulk orders","Hello,
after a good experience with online sales a few years ago I am looking to get back in the business. Due to the massive improvements in affordable ""safe"" (trackable) shipments for small products i am going to give a try to drop shipping.
I already considered factors such as quality and given my niche (electronic kits) I can test it beforehard for really cheap and is usually good, what I am more concerned about is logistics and billing details, so i`d really be grateful if you could give me some hints :)

- At first, when volumes are low, there is no point in sending each aliexpress supplier a csv with product code and address straight from my paypal sales list and then bulk-pay them, but is it a possibility in the future or they are not that organized and I should manually enter order myself/ have them entered one by one even down the line?

-Say that I enter orders one by one manually on aliExpress (at least at the beginning thats what Ill be doing), beside the usual we-are-dropshipping-no-leaflets-or-promotions thing, what data should I enter in the purchase info?
I obviously wanted it to be billed to myself/my company and shipped to my customer still I dont want them to get the reicipt showing the original price and vendor. How to handle this?

shopify,Weekly Venting Recap,"Just a little bit of venting since it seems this week I took many calls all revolving around similar issues:

1.  No Traffic / No sales...  ok.  No Traffic is an indication of your marketing and not your website.  So don't waste your time tinkering with your website and fix your marketing.  No Sales could be a variety of things...  you have a crappy product, its over priced, your website is confusing or unpleasing, and there is of course the fact if you have no traffic you will have no sales...

2. Total lack of understanding of how to run an online retail business.  How is it someone gets into online retailing but does not understand or use analytics and search console?  How does someone think they will survive in this business but does not understand marketing.  Is it the fact there are no barriers to entry to starting an online store?  The only one making money are the people hosting and building these sites plus social media and google for charging for advertising.

3. To be successful online you have to also be on Amazon.  Not selling TO Amazon but selling ON Amazon.  And if you plan to get into the wholesale side of retailing then you can't sell on Amazon under your own storefront name because of channel conflicts.

4.  Not having a business plan.  I read a great quote this morning.  Having a goal without a plan is called a wish.  If your plan is ""I hope this works"" is only going to cost you whatever money you put into it and probably more so.

ecommerce,New E-commerce looking for feedbacks,"Hi everyone,

A bit less than a year ago, I started selling custom cufflinks on Etsy. The customer feedbacks were great and I had the feeling I could do more than the Etsy shop so I decided to take the plunge.  A friend of mine joined the project; we took all the insights we gathered from Etsy and started working on our own shopify website.

We launched [Gregson &amp; Buck](https://www.gregsonandbuck.com) 3 weeks ago and currently advertise it through Facebook and Adwords (search only). The ads landing pages are our collection pages. We started retargeting campaigns but our audience is too small so it's not really working yet.
We also started working on our SEO and contacted some Instagram influencers but we still need a few more weeks to see the impacts of these channels.

In terms of stats, we have:

* An average of 50 UV/day (1300 in total).
* 2% bounce rate, 4 PV/session yet only 24% of the sessions visit a product page (according to analytics).
* 7 add to cart, 1 reached checkout but 0 sale.

ecommerce,Is SEO a mistake?,"Hey Everone, 

We spent the last year building our e-commerce store (www.matcha.com). We were fortunate enough to land a killer domain right out of the gate. We spent quite a bit of resources to design and build what we think is an amazing website. We invested in great photography and good content. We launched in January and we had a fair amount of sales for the first few months. Each month we tweaked a little bit here and a little bit there but nothing made a huge difference as far as bringing in more sales. We decided to hire an SEO company to work on building quality links and spreading/building our brand. The first month or so we started seeing a lot more traffic coming to the website but sales dropped off. We kept asking the SEO company if it's typical to see a dip in sales and they said ""sometimes."" After two months of increasing traffic, but no sales, we decided to part ways. I'm wondering if somehow we gained more traffic but somehow pissed off Google in the process? 

Or, is something wrong with our sales funnel, or worst yet, our website? 

We're new to Reddit, but I've read some great comments, from some very bright folks here. Any thoughts, ideas, feedback here?

ecommerce,How to create a purpose-driven retail brand: tips from Lisa Hogg from TOMS,"If you've been in retail for a bit, you've probably heard about this company called TOMS. It is a successful shoe retailer built on the *One for One* concept, meaning that for every single pair of shoes that people buy, there’s a pair of shoes given to a child in need. In 10 years, the brand became kind of a huge deal and now is worth $400 million, according to Inc. 

We recently interviewed Lisa Hogg, the brand's EMEA Marketing Director, and she gave some pretty interesting insights on their business model, so I thought they might be helpful to you too. Here's the bullet-pointed summary of the interview:

* **Start with a socially-responsible idea and the rest will follow**: more and more consumers nowadays are driven to do more good, so, if you start with a good purpose and good messaging behind your products, customers will follow.  According to Lisa, you won't even have to scratch your head over marketing too much: 
&gt;""Marketing is a powerful growth tool, but it all starts with having an authentic and true story to tell.""

* **As brand grows bigger, expand your product categories that still stand for the same idea/cause**: TOMS grew super fast, so now they don't only sell shoes, but also eyewear, tote bags, and coffee, which all ""address"" different issues: sales from eyewear go to help the visually impaired, sales for tote bags go help safe childbirth, coffee goes for bottles of clear water to those who don't have it, etc.
 
* **Community building is important**: it also starts within your own company. 

Community should be built both offline (if you have a physical retail store) and online (if you have an e-commerce store). When offline, create a place where people can hang out (like a cafe). When online, create something for them to discuss/talk about online. 

* **When it comes to marketing and e-commerce KPIs, keep it simple**: it's the usual suspects of engagement per post, pageviews, following growth, click-throughs, view-through rates, conversion, and revenue. But nothing extraordinary.

* **When it comes to keeping up with retail trends**,  Lisa advises to not spread too thin, but always keep close to the core of your brand so that you don't lose the essence behind the constantly changing trends.

I think purpose-driven, one-for-one retail and e-commerce brands are becoming increasingly popular now, so it's interesting to see how other companies started! But honestly, I also wonder if this is just a ""guilt-free"" way for people to indulge in shopping even more than they already do and companies just recognize that and manage to manipulate that super smoothly, or is it that they REALLY want to help and ""spread goodness"" around the world?

shopify,I got scammed by a Web developer,"I got scammed from a Web site builder on shopify

I am new to ecommerce and shopify in general and needed help building a website. I posted on this forum ealier asking if somebody could help me build a website and somebody from shopifystores@yandex.Com messaged me saying they could help me build a website for $300USD. Having never paid anybody online I again asked you guys how secure it is to pay somebody with PayPal because I am new and scared to pay somebody I have never meet. The guy built my website and everything seemed fine and I being new and naive paid him the remaining balance right away. I supplied him with my suppliers product feed in a csv file and he uploaded it to my store. I know my csv feed had multiple pictures per product but on my website there was only one picture per product and I asked him to fix it. He said he will charge me an extra $200USD to fix the file and make all my pictures show up. He knew that I am new and by only supplying me with half the work he wanted more money to complete the website he agreed to. Now I have started a dispute with PayPal and they said I have to wait 20 days for him to respond. He responded and said he will fix my website and if I could give him the staff account he will log in and add the extra pictures.  Again me being new and naive I believed him. He logged into my account and deleted EVERYTHING. I had spent countless hours working on my collections and adding images to categories and adding logos and such. I had done so much to the website that he completely wiped out. And that's not even the end of it. Being a new store I had 2 orders totaling $90 which he completely refunded to the customers. Now not only am I out of the money I paid for the website which I don't have. I am also out of money that I paid the supplier to ship products. This was my very first experience in the online world and I tried to do everything to protect myself.  I posted on this website trusting that I was among a group of people who collectively wanted to progress and help each other out. I asked here to find a Web developer and I asked here how I should pay him. No matter how much I tried to be safe I am left with absolutely nothing now. And it doesn't end there.  I have over 20 messages of this guy emailing me saying how's his gonna hand out my ip adress to all the Web developers so they won't work with me. He said his gonna give out my personal address to people and his gonna make sure that I never own another website again. I have over 20 emails of him saying his gonna things to my mother and sister. I am at such a loss right now. I have not so much as spoken to this guy rudely and his swore at me and my family and done so much damage to me financially. I have lost so much time I spent trying to build something I no longer have. And I'm out of money customers paid me. 

 

If you are somebody like me who is new to shopify please please please do your research and find somebody local u can see in person. 

 

This persons email is shopifystores@yandex.Com 

And his PayPal account name is Ecommerce Stores 

Please save yourself this headache and do not work with this person. From his ip he is located in india so getting the law involved or small claims court to get my money back is useless 

Sorry for the long rant but I am so hurt and broken right now.

ecommerce,"Looking for someone to ""own"" the online version of my retail store. Need help nailing down a plan...","So we have a very successful retail store.  Our online store is meh, but generates about $60k/year in sales with 0 effort.  We are sitting on a huge potential because of the industry, our niche, our current customer base, and product selection.

I'm pretty busy running the retail store (there are two components there, plus we are launching a wholesale business soon), so I can't really roll up my sleeves and get stuff done like I want with online.

I'm thinking of hiring a true leader in to manage the thing.  I'm willing to backload the salary substantially.  For example, if the salary is 40k/year, they would be required to generate 120k in revenue to cover their costs.  If they can't do that, then obviously they are incompetent at the role and/or it just ""won't work.""  I would backload by offering 5% of all sales generated above that threshold.  

Then, as it grows and we need more staff, that person could take a more senior role, supervising other support staff etc.  I would say we could hire someone if the revenue justifies it, i.e. we can't add a 30k position until/if with sales metrics to support it.  Then the ""finish line"" would move a bit - i.e. if this person needs another support staffer at 30k/yr to generate 500k in revenue, then the ""owner"" would have to have 210k of revenue before their ""bonus"" opportunity opened up.

I personally would jump at this opportunity, if I weren't the guy offering the opportunity.

I'm wondering if this is a good approach.  What should I look out for?  What should I look for in someone that would really lead this?  Where could I look for ""applicants""?  

Feedback is appreciated!

I feel these are pretty extensive checks, but shopify still refuse to release the money which means I will have to cancel the customers order after already messing them about by asking for so much additional information that you wouldn't normally be asked to provide.

shopify,Beta testers needed - Shopify AI chatbot,"Hi all,

Hopping over from /chatbots to share something I hope will interest you.

My company has built a neat one-click integration that enables Shopify store owners to **deploy an artificially intelligent chatbot straight on their store**. 

After much internal testing, we have decided to open our beta list to the public - hence my post!

**What does it do?**
After the one-click install (which happens through the Shopify apps), a friendly personal shopper will greet visitors to your website, talk to them casually and guide them through the product selection and purchase journey. Your personal shopper is smart. It learns and remembers what a user is looking for to deliver a 24/7 personalised experience, at scale.

**What is happening right now?**
Right now, we are slowly releasing the product to beta testers - for free. Signing up to the page below will put you in the list. We are releasing slowly to keep a handle on the number of people using it and keep the testing contained.

**Who are you?**
We are a leading chatbot building company. We typically work on creating bespoke chatbots for massive enterprise clients (Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson, BabyCenter, and more). This is a product we came up with recently and thought it would be fun to release to you all!

**How do I get in?**
Simple. Fill out the very small form on the page below, and you'll be added to our list.

[AI + Shopify: The future is bright](https://hi.ubisend.com/shopify-beta)

**Is this alright?**
This is me asking, actually. I hope me sharing this is alright with your community! I am more than happy to engage in the conversation below, share more details about what we do, and answer any questions you may have!

ecommerce,Verifying large transactions to prevent fraud chargebacks,"I recently had a string of fraud chargebacks from Mexico, where the billing name address was different from the shipping name and address. Now I got two large orders that have two different billing addresses in Argentina but the shipping address and name for both is (presumably) a freight forwarder in Miami.

Is there a good way to verify that these are not fraudulent orders and protect myself from a chargeback?",4,3,2017-04-30,ECOM,0.0940549299120903,0.8739678263664246,0.031977277249097824

So im planning on running a cashback campaign which means i need to recieve and send alot of big and little payments and im wondering which payment processor would fit best. 
Paypal would be my favorite but the fees are kinda high if you're not haveing a huge monthly revenue. 
What are your opinions on this ?",0,2,2017-04-30,ECOM,0.024058155715465546,0.8897802829742432,0.0861615538597107
woocommerce,Is this possible with woocommerce ?,"I want to know if this is possible:

*Back-end*

* Create ingredients with individual prices
* Create Category A product that has some of the created ingredients 
* Create Category B product that has some of the created ingredients 

*Front-end*

* User can order a variable product. That is made up by a product from category A and category B.

The user doesnt see the ingredients. Its only for reporting purposes so that the store owner can see how much an order costs",4,2,2017-04-30,ECOM,0.06423435360193253,0.9154521226882935,0.020313523709774017

woocommerce,Woocommerce Discord Community,"First of all I'm not sure if this is allowed or if I'm breaking the rules. Feel free to remove this post mods if I am.
Anyways, It's always annoying that every time you have a problem or simple question, you have to go on reddit or some forums and wait like an hour for a response. I decided to make a discord server for people who work with woocommerce and wordpress to make it easier to communicate.
For those of you who don't know what discord is, it's essentially like skype but better for bigger communities. There's instant messaging text channels, theres also voice channels where you can talk and many other features.
The discord server would be a good way to get technical questions answered quickly, be able for professionals to network with each other better, and just use it as a resource to improve your site.
