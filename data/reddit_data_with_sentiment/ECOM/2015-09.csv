dropship,How are you guys handling your shipping costs?,"I'll be competing against some big players with established track records (which is probably why their shipping costs are so low) and I can see them offering shipping for as little as $6 sometimes on rather large orders.

woocommerce,How does Woocommerce handle a transaction?,"I'm considering using Woo for a web store I am planning to build and I had a question as to when does Woocommerce make the transaction/take the $ from the customer?

Does it process the transaction immediately once the customer places the order? Or does the transaction take place once the the site admin puts the order through, once the order is packed and shipped?

The site will not track inventory as we run a brick and mortar store as well and don't see a way to connect the brick and mortar inventory in the POS with the inventory in Woocommerce in real time.  That being said, it's important that we don't sell things on the web site that we don't have in stock.  We would like it so that the transaction isn't complete until the admin or webstore operator has a chance to modify / verify that the order can be/is  shipped complete.

Any insight is appreciated.

shopify,Why do all the Shopify SEO resources suck?,"So today I decided to Google 'Shopify SEO' to see if there was anything I was missing or domain specific to Shopify that I needed to know.

Every article, whether published by Shopify or a blog post written by someone, spiels the same SEO 101 stuff.

I could find barely _anything_ that actually involved the intricacies of Shopify itself.

Nothing on the the common tripping points, like 

- applying proper microdata to pagination
- or how the robots.txt file is locked and stupidly filters out any multi-word vendor names so you have to create collections instead if you want Google to actually find your brands
- or how how to properly do breadcrumbs with the liquid syntax and change the canonical url for products to include the brand collection.
- or how to utilise metafields as extra fields to provide more content for your pages

ecommerce,Advice on reaching a specific audience,"Hey everybody, I recently launched an ecommerce site selling all-over printed tank tops. I have a pretty solid idea of who buys the style we offer on the website. I also know a few other companies that these potential customers follow and buy from. 

I think having this information is a great start for us. When it comes to online shopping for clothing, most people aren't 100% loyal to 1 brand, and we think that people will be happy that we are around because now it gives them more options...basically its not all or nothing, there's enough people buying and if we offer unique and original things there is no reason we couldn't capture a small piece of this market. 

My question is what are some effective ways of letting these people know we exist. Manually interacting with them on Instagram, Twitter, and FB has been effective, but it's very time consuming for a small return. We are happily continuing those strategies, but does anyone have any experience or suggestions on more effective ways to get followers of our competitors to also follow us?

woocommerce,Multisite with Woo,"I'm reposting this here from the Wordpress subreddit. I figure the more places it is the more likely someone will find it. If I get any definitive answers or find a solution I'll make sure to leave it in the comments. 

-- repost below -- 
Hey everyone. I've been put on the task of creating an online store for the shop I work at and today's my first day (woo). The website is pretty well set up, and so I'm getting into integrating the online sales to some courses we offer. I've done the research and it seems for our size woo commerce is going to be the best option. The only problem I'm having - and it seems to be a common one - is I'm on multisite, and I would like a shared cart. I've gone over tons of internet and read endless empty promises from people claiming to be working on a plugin for this problem (I'll believe it when I see it).
I've brainstormed 2 possible solutions, but both would require a decent amount of work, so I figured I'd get reddit's opinion first. The first idea was to just disable woo on all sites besides the parent site and just iframe products in as needed. This could work, but it seems a little bit crude, and it would probably take more time styling everything than I would like.
The other option - which I'm not sure is possible or not - would be to use hooks and hook the original cart in. I'm pretty new to hooks though, so there would be a decent learning curve until progress was shown - plus I don't even know if it's possible.
Please let me know if you have any insight into either of these methods or if you've found another way of solving this problem.
OH! also! As much as I would like to moving away from multisite isn't a viable option. I appreciate your help!",0,1,2015-09-03,ECOM,0.02835063450038433,0.9121888279914856,0.05946055427193642

dropship,Newb Alert: Found a supplier...looking for advice!,"Hi Guys,

Looking to embark upon my first dropshipping adventure (excuse the pun!)

I've found a company called Ruidxin (www.ruidxin.com), based in China, who are selling the products i'm interested in buying...however, they seem to be selling for a good deal cheaper than other sites i've used. Initiallyâ¦I thought ""great!""

Then a few moments later, my suspicious side took over so I asked the following questions:
âWhatâs your reason for being able to sell so cheaplyâ - to which their response was ""we buy from China foxconn site directly"" - makes sense... 

âHow can they verify to me that your products are genuineâ - they said âyou can buy a sample itemâ (which costs a couple hundred bucks) âto test, then send back and claim refundâ
âDo you offer a product warrantyâ â âyes, all of our products come with an International 1 year warrantyâ

Everything seems to check out at this point, so then I take to Google and search ""Ruidxin reviews"" to which the very first post was this - http://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.ruidxin.com - I understand that there may be an element of âback-stabbingâ from competitors trying to deter people from buying from their rivals, however this has completely put me off the idea of working with Ruidxin â rightly so I believe??

So, to my questions:

- How do you know that the company aren't just sending you a legitimate ""sample"" to inspect, then sending a load of crap to clients who you've sold to? Do you have some sort of policy to counter this?

- Can some companies genuinely offer cheaper stock than competitors based on sourcing directly from the manufacturer - or should you generally trust your natural instinct and follow the ""if it's too good to be true, it usually is"" mantra?

- Can anybody recommend (based on personal experience) any trusted Warehouses which deal with electronics?

- Has anybody had their fingers burnt by Ruidxin (or anybody else for that matter)?

Iâm really looking forward to building a self-sufficient company in an industry I really am passionate about, I just want to make sure Iâm covering all bases before I steam into this!

Sweatshirts | $8.00 | $1.00

I've never used Shopify before, so I'm going in blind. I've done some preliminary research, but I'm not sure exactly how the system works. At the moment, I don't have any products of my own.

I'm taking over the development of our WooCommerce Gateway plugin (I work for a card processing company) from our 3rd party developers.

The plugin that we have is giving the above error, but I'm unable to find out where this error is coming from.  There's no clues in the web page, nor is there any clue in the php error logs.

I don't know if anyone else has experienced similar or not.

I'm currently using WooCommerce 2.4.6 on top of Wordpress 4.3.

I've tried looking through all the code for our plugin for a random &lt; somewhere but to no avail.

I must say that it doesn't feel like the plugin has got particularly great code behind it, but I thought it would be better to modify the plugin to work, rather than start from scratch.

Would anyone have any clues? If you need to be able to install the gateway plugin to test, I can PM links to the source for you to install the plugin.

Any help anyone could provide will be much appreciated.

Do I have to take legal measures, or how can I close to account without them stealing my funds.

ANY help is appreciate, thanks guys!",14,2,2015-09-17,ECOM,0.2056540995836258,0.7535416483879089,0.040804192423820496

 I'm trying to show a product count against the product categories in the admin (not front end), so it's easier to locate product categories and build out the main menu for it.

 This is from a data import so the categories are a bit iffy, want to include the main ones but there is a lot of categories to shift through and some duplicate names in there as well which are obsolete and need removing from the data.

 Problem is, I have no control over this data, so need to make do with what categories that are in play.

 Is there something to add to the functions.php to simply show against each product category in appearance &gt; menu's &gt; product categories &gt; category #1 (3500) ? So I know where the bulk of products lay?

ecommerce,"Absolute newbie interested in started e-commerce site with layout similar to Amazon's, selling third-party products... need help! Advice!","So I am interested and determined to start an e-commerce site selling products from sites, basically I'd be an aggregator of products from many other websites, with a certain theme.   I don't want to reveal the theme of the website, but let's use an example, of say, massage products, for example sake.  I want be a seller of marketplace for massage products from other stores, the same way that Amazon does with their third party sellers.

So obviously what I need to figure out here is the programming of the website and I need to be literate to help facilitate and not get hosed in that process.  I don't know the process for this at all and don't want to get taken for a ride. I would love to get some input, before going to a programmer, or some expensive consultancy firm with no idea what I'm talking about, showing up and saying ""hey, build me a site with all these features that can link up with all these sites to sell their products, process the transactions, yada yada"" and end up spending an extra $30k because I didn't know some very basic things I should have from the outset.

For background, I have worked in finance, so have a very good sense of numbers, due diligence and business analysis.  I just don't know squat about building a viable e-commerce website that can sell third-party products, and am not of the uber wealthy finance type that can afford to waste a fortune making mistakes and getting taken for a ride having someone tinkering and messing up with the programming of the site.

Any positive feedback, links, advice is welcome.  Questions in my mind...
Where do I find good programmers for an e-commerce site?  
What is a good price for the site?  
What should I know about site security software?

shopify,Is it possible to make a custom form in Shopify?,I've been setting up a store and I need a form to request invoice information. I tried using the contact form as a base but I've had no luck so far. Is there an easier way or another option to add a form? Is it better to just add the fields in a page? I've seen other sites using google docs but I don't really like how they look.,1,2,2015-09-30,ECOM,0.01915876753628254,0.9247913956642151,0.05604986846446991

shopify,"There's no F.A.Q. or Wiki so putting this out here: I'm a webdeveloper making a shopify site for a customer, what should I know?","So for about 4-5 years now I've taught myself webdev. My javascript skills are basically limited to Googling what I want, and copy pasting, with the occasional variable name changes, but my HTML is up to date and semantic for the most part, and for CSS I'm even pretty okay at SCSS (compiling, mixins and all). 

I've built sites using Zurb's Foundation, Bootstrap, and Wordpress. I'm guessing Shopify won't be too hard (hopefully), so if you've been where I am now, what do I absolutely need to know?

For context: The job is creating an editorial site / shopify site for make-up products. I'm actually thinking of making the editorial site + blog all in wordpress or bootstrap, and then running the shopify on a subdomain.",1,1,2015-09-30,ECOM,0.05177102982997894,0.9210750460624695,0.02715396322309971
shopify,How to Create a Press Kit That Gets Publicity for Your Business,"Hi Shopify Entrepreneurs,

I recently stumbled upon an article on the Shopify Blog on how to create a press kit for your Shopify store (https://www.shopify.com/blog/44447941-how-to-create-a-press-kit-that-gets-publicity-for-your-business), which inspired me to create a new app to make it easier to do just that.

The app is called PresskitHero, and is available on the Shopify App Store:

https://apps.shopify.com/presskithero

The app makes it dead simple to create a professional press kit, without the need to know how to code or hire a designer.

If you have any question or feature request, send me an email to hello@presskithero.com",1,1,2015-09-30,ECOM,0.017735127359628677,0.9305019378662109,0.051762912422418594
