Anyways, since I've been successful I'd like to begin a 2nd site.  Only problem is I am SO ANXIOUS about the idea of creating another Shopify site from scratch.  To be honest, the site creation, design, web mail set-up, product listings pages, collections (etc etc) is just so time consuming I'm so not ready to do it all over again.

Has anyone had success with contacting suppliers BEFORE LAUNCHING a SITE?  I'm just curious because my best supplier never once asked me any questions about my web site prior to making me an approved supplier.  So I'm thinking maybe not all suppliers do a ""background check"" so to speak.

I just don't want to waste another 40 hours of work in a new niche just to get turned down by suppliers (HINT: there's only about 10 suppliers in the niche, so I'm a little nervous to put in the up front investment).

I have had some okay success with my sound effects/sound design business. Around $10,000 a year or so in profits. Things have slowed down at my other job and I want to try to take my business to the next level.

I just released a sound pack Steam Machines and it did REALLY bad in sales. I spent a lot of time emailing blogs of the release, got lots of tweets about it and such but....only a few sales. I did manage to license this pack for some good money but the low sales hit me hard. **It's funny because people were wanting a sound pack like this. There were poles of sound people who wanted this!** 

I did redesign my front page for the release to try to get the maximum exposer. Redesign meaning I just slapped the new product on the front page with all the cool artwork/type. Did I screw up there?

Anyway I would love some advice on the site. [Moon Echo Audio](http://www.moonechoaudio.com/)

shopify,How to set up large dropship fulfillment? And deal with disputes,"Hi Guys,

I'm new to this and doing quite well already, but slightly scared to move on into the big numbers in fear of losing lots of money due to lost packages and having to fulfill refunds. I guess I could always get a refund from the supplier on aliexpress aswell, I'm not sure how to handle it.

My main problem. I am ordering a dropship product from aliexpress and I have no idea if they've arrived to my customers yet. I guess I'll just have to wait for the paypal disputes to come in, thats the only way I can know? How do I know if the product will arrive to them or not when sorting out a dispute? Since I can't provide evidence of shipment tracking would I lose every dispute and have to give refunds, I would like it if I could just reassure the customers there products are arriving soon, I could always offer to send them a new one and a different product for compensation

Are disputes common, how can I track orders once they leave China? Bear in mind, I am selling cheap products with the free plus shipping offer. The product costs me less than £2 but if I had to return all of them I would lose too my profits and my own money.

My products say they've left origin country (china) about 15 days ago but they never seem to arrive in the UK and the tracking number doesn't work on the royal mail website, do I just have to wait a bit?

Also I've asked the supplier not to include original reciepts with the original  price on the packaging, and I really hope they don't",4,2,2016-07-03,ECOM,0.14301499724388123,0.8230908513069153,0.03389415889978409

24,99 - (24,99 * 0,25) - 9,20 (Dropshippers price)

You receive an order and then the details are forwarded to your supplier automatically, they receive details for shipment, but how do they bill you for this?

ecommerce,100% FDI in E-commerce : Guidelines and Effects,"The Union government on March 29, 2016, allowed 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in online retail of goods and services under the marketplace model of e-commerce through the automatic route. This was announced by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) through press note 3 of the 2016 series. Definitions of marketplace model and inventory based model of e-commerce had also been given alongside.

According to the press report issued by the DIPP, a marketplace model is an information technology platform run by an e-commerce entity on a digital or electronic network to act as a facilitator between buyers and sellers, while inventory based model of e-commerce means an online commercial activity wherein the inventory of goods and services being owned by the e-commerce entity is sold directly to the customers.

The decision has been welcomed as a game-changer by many, especially offline sellers because the newly notified rules may bring online and offline sellers on a level playing field. It all started with allegations being made by brick and mortar store owners saying that Indian companies were flouting existing policy norms. They moved the Delhi High Court arguing that online retail companies have gained undue edge through their access to Foreign Direct Investment, which enabled them to offer lofty discounts that conventional retailers could not afford. So far, India has allowed 100% FDI only in B2B (Business to Business) e-commerce and none in B2C (Business to Commerce) e-commerce. The brick mortar store owners also accused these ventures of selling directly to customers under the garb of marketplace model, thus violating rules.

Some restrictions also follow as part of the guidelines issued with regard to this decision.

Marketplace firms cannot offer discounts directly. Only vendors selling products and services on their sites can offer discounts to lure customers. Thus Flipkart or Amazon will not be directly able to give discounts while vendors who use these marketplaces will be able to offer discounts on the websites.
Any single seller or a group company of the marketplace e-commerce entity cannot account for over 25% of the total sales. This sets a ceiling for how much of the marketplace a single brand has a hold over. This encourages the entry of more brands and is beneficial for customers.
These new rules could potentially end discount centric competition among various e-commerce sites, which is not a very pleasing consequence for online customers who made great savings through these rebates. Although offline stores, having witnessed a downward trend in customer footfall due to increased efficiency of e-commerce websites, may see a reversal in the trend.

The real change that has come as a part of the new guidelines has come in terms of clarity of the provisions, which was long overdue considering the ambiguity surrounding the sector. E-commerce companies were already operating under marketplace models, and most of them attracted significant investments. The meteoric rise of the e-commerce sector has been seen as troubling by regulatory authorities such as FEMA, SEBI and the RBI. Regulatory authorities have feared that transactions within e-commerce entities lack transparency. DIPP’s Press Note is in response to these concerns by regulatory authorities.  

Had FDI been allowed in inventory model of e-commerce, the modification would have been more thought-provoking. Global giants like Amazon have been wanting to convert into a hybrid of both models, but with the new notifications, we do not see that happening very soon. Time will tell how well the government monitors indirect discounting methods since products sold on such marketplaces are legally sold by multiple vendors. Discounts are included in the pricing and are also billed as marketing cost through vouchers. This sector has attracted maximum FDI in 2015 and holds even more potential once there is clarity in policies. Value added services being provided by marketplace operators will improve customer experience and also market outreach for small and medium-size suppliers.

E-commerce ventures have been offering steep discounts to increase revenue. While this raised huge sums from investors, it led to substantial losses too. With the new rules banning discounts, competition will be solely on the basis of innovative methods of attracting customers. In the short term, the value of investments may shrink since there will no longer be huge growth in revenues. As an example, we see Morgan Stanley having already taken down its value of investment in Flipkart by 27%. In the long run, however, there will probably be a rejuvenation of profits due to the end of colossal discounts. True competition, not based on the maximum discounts offered will lead to investor perception of the companies being improved and subsequent rise in valuations.",1,2,2016-07-09,ECOM,0.04557185806334019,0.5628968179225922,0.39153132401406765
ecommerce,Experience with profitableonlinestore.com and/or fizzle.co?,"Hi all, 

Curious if anyone has direct experience with either of these online courses. I've recently downsized my business from a large manufacturing facility with 9 employees down to me in my garage. I have some local suppliers for the one product line that I plan to  carry on with after some more intensive market research (this was not my main product and is a newish/unique product in the market) and hope to expand the products in the niche. I experimented a bit before with shopify on my site but my local day to day manufacturing business was my main focus and I didn't find much success with my online efforts. I still have a site up for the product and will look to re-vamp and add back a shopping platform over the next while. 

If I don't find that the products will be worth my efforts to continue with I will still be looking to setup and sell online within a few different niche ideas that I have.   

So I've been reading a lot and listening to podcasts on the subject and am very much interested in finding an online source with more specific information like the two courses I've mentioned above but am a bit torn on which to invest in.

My Shopify store has been open for a few months now, and is doing reasonably well. I'm always improving, updating, finding new products etc.
I'm finding it hard to find the time to regularly create email campaigns to send the the people who have subscribed to my email list.
I'm using the integration between Shopify and Mailchimp, which works well for keeping the list updated. The problem is getting creative with the emails. 

I'm always reading how important it is to build up an email list, but so far the campaigns I have sent out haven't yielded any results. I only have 160 subscribers, but I feel like I haven't found the right way to do it.

Do you have any suggestions on how to create a successful email campaign? Anyone with experience on outsourcing it maybe? 

Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Time to get creative.,"I've received more than a couple of email campaigns today from retailers talking about Prime day .........Amazon has created something here that is putting people in the buying mood, or so it seems. I thought it was really compelling to see smaller retailers trying to capitalize on this 'buzz' for their own benefit.

A couple of them have nothing at all do to with Prime, they are just trying to slipstream some sales of their own. Pretty smart. If folks are warmed up and ready to buy via Prime/Amazon buzz, might be a great time to drop a social promotion or email blast to get them into your shop instead.

ecommerce,Seeking advice with my eCommerce entrepreneur journey,"Hi guys,

Long time lurker, first time poster. I've recently gained the courage to start importing goods and reselling them. I am around 3 months in, I've been taking baby steps however now I'm looking for a bit of advice.


I live in New Zealand, with a population of only 4 million and no large countries near us (other than Australia), given this, we don't use eBay, Amazon etc at all, we use a site called [trademe](http://trademe.co.nz) (which I am currently selling on). I feel as if at this stage, my main market would be people within my existing country. 


I don't have my own ecommerce website or anything like this at this stage, as I'm in a very broad market - electronics. I've read a lot about niche markets being good, and to stick to one product, however I do feel that will be hard given the very small size of my country - but maybe I am mistaken. I'm just somewhat stumped on where to go and what the best means of scaling is for a country so small. I've been thinking of niche markets, and really haven't had any good ideas. Had a bit of success with what I'm doing currently although not the best (65 items/6 weeks). Haven't tracked my weekly profits etc or anything as it's more of a hobby at the moment but I want to get serious about it, so software would help too.


This is my [store](http://www.trademe.co.nz/Members/Listings.aspx?member=5881589) . My current plan was just to expand on a massive variety of items slowly and then move to facebook / maybe a website in the future.

Should be noted: KPIs should be set according to your company’s goals and objectives and then carefully monitored on a regular (better — daily) basis. But the most important thing to remember here is that without context and interpretation, KPIs don’t mean anything at all. It’s not the information that has value, but what we do with this information.

ecommerce,Political merchandise store help,"Www.election-depot.com

Hey guys. So I've been wanting to try out a simple ecommerce site for a while, and figured that election season was the perfect time, since people are always looking for merch for their candidate, etc. especially at the start of the general. 

So I've made some shirt designs as well as posters. As well as some parodies of the trump hat I think are pretty solid. 

As you might tell from the site, so far the products are pretty anti both trump and Clinton, which I feel like is a pretty large demo. But the site is pretty generalized. Should I stay as general political merchandise, or focus on merch for a specific candidate? (Probably Gary Johnson at this point)

If had the site up for about two weeks. Just activated Adwords last week and cranked up the daily spend on Tuesday to $100 but still have only had 2 conversions and about 700 site visits. Bounce rate around 80%

I'm having trouble with this - I found both a plugin and a php hook to add to woocommerce that remove the Add to Cart button successfully. This is what I want. Unfortunately, it also takes the drop-down menus away, and this is not at all what I want. 

Is there a way I can keep the drop-down menus but remove the Add to Cart button?",7,2,2016-07-18,ECOM,0.2298957109451294,0.7485153079032898,0.021588953211903572
ecommerce,Call for API Standards and Accreditation,"I'm making a call here to eCommerce companies to start to make an eCommerce standard, to build an accreditation council, and no API gets accredited by that council unless it meets certain standards. I'd like to see Stripe take the lead on that because, hands down, they have the best APIs out there.

As a PHP web developer working in eCommerce, I have seen some crazy APIs out there that make you go, ""Huh?"" 

Take for instance FirstData/PayEezy. They have a token API to give you better PCI compliance. Token APIs are clearly the new trend and way to go for PCI compliance, and Stripe took the lead on that. So, you generate a token in your web page and don't have to post the credit card number to your server. But with PayEezy, guess what you still need to post to your web server and save in order to run that purchase and then have the power to do a void or refund? You need to store the card type (visa, etc.), cardholder's name, and the card expiration date. You're probably going, ""Huh?"" Yep. The whole point of the token API is to get the card authorized, generate a single token, and then push only the token plus any shipping or billing address metadata, or sku/pricing/fees/taxes metadata, along with that form to your web server for finalizing that purchase. It's highly desirable to get out of the business of pushing credit card data itself to your servers, if you're a web developer. See, the way PayEezy has done it -- they don't seem realize or acknowledge that hackers merge databases from multiple sources. If hackers have your card number from one source, they can hack someone using PayEezy, and, if that data isn't encrypted in the web developer's database, they can merge it with that card number and now you can see full-on identity theft. See the problem here?

Take for instance eProcessingNetwork.com. Great system, although each transaction runs 2-4 seconds slower than any competitor I've seen (although Avangate comes in a close second to them), and the web admin interface is so 1999 as well as slow. (The company codes everything in CGI Perl -- so, that's ancient.) However, even with these misgivings, the API is easy to understand and my onboarding them was almost as fast as understanding Stripe. They even have a token API. But guess what? You have to write your own Javascript JSONP interface to your own web page where you convert a card into a token. But you're probably saying, ""Huh?"" there too. Yep. Every competitor I've seen to them that has a token API has their own JSONP interface and uses their own https domain, which is far more secure and far more PCI compliant than you generating your own tokens with a Curl interface on your web server back to them. You might be asking -- why even generate a token if I have to post the card info to the web server in the first place? Yep, that's what I said. With just a few tweaks, eProcessingNetwork.com can be an awesome system second to Stripe. (If you are the CEO of eProcessingNetwork.com, then hire me as a technical consultant -- I'm sure my recommendations could 10x your profit. I still have great faith in your company.)

I can't tell you how many times I have to fight with an API because their docs suck, or find out that the only way you can get your project online is to call tech support and then they answer, ""Well, yeah, you have to turn X and Y on for this to work. It's not clearly documented. Sorry."" (Had this happen both with 2Checkout and PayEezy.)

Still another problem is that when you're hunting for an eCommerce API platform, some websites out there are really devious. They don't let you know whether they are the dealers of that API themselves, or if they use a third-party. Some also make it super hard to find out if they do token-based APIs much like Stripe does, or even let you get a glimpse of their APIs first before signing up. Those two problems are incredibly frustrating.

But most of all -- the world of eCommerce is changing. We're now seeing a rise in chargebacks. Consumers think they can purchase stuff online and then turn around and charge it back, denying they ever received it. In other situations, card skimming and RFID chip scans are increasing at a rapid rate and this is increasing chargebacks too. So, even if you idolize Stripe and providers like it, that idolatry will get you nowhere because the ugly truth in eCommerce to us guys in the trenches is that in order to have your website survive, you're going to need to use multiple payment gateways, not just one or two, in order to keep your chargeback ratio low. Stripe will drop you if your chargeback hits a mere 1%, although they seem to let your balance get to $100K and may let you slide if you're less than 1.4% and seem to get your chargeback situation under control after that. Think about how easy it is to go over a 1% chargeback rate! In fact, I'm working with a client right now and they have a whopping 20 payment gateways that they use round-robin in order to keep chargeback rates low, and to take one offline if they have a dispute outage, or to take one offline if it's server just got DDoS'd (case in point, 2Checkout was down for me the other day due to their server being DDoS'd).

Here's what I propose that these eCommerce providers do with this accreditation council:

1. Don't accredidate an eCommerce API company unless they have a token API much like Stripe's or BraintreePayment's. By this, I mean that if a web developer has to send and/or store any credit card data on their own servers using a company's API, rather than a token, then that API shouldn't be accredited.

2. The PCI council should be a financial and technical sponsor of this council in order to ensure better financial data security standards.

3. eCommerce API companies need to pay an annual fee for accreditation and annual accreditation audit.

4. If two developers (employed with the accreditation council) test an API independently (without speaking to each other) and find that they both can't get onboarded into the sandbox or production without a tech support call to understand something because their docs fail to indicate how to do the token API, then a PASS/FAIL test would be marked FAIL with an explanation of why it failed. An eCommerce company would then have to fix the failing reason and pay to resubmit to the API review.

5. eCommerce companies come in different levels. Some do APIs, some work through third parties, some are scammers, and so on. The council needs to create categories and put these companies in those buckets so that it's easy for web developers like myself to know who I'm dealing with and to not get scammed. One of those categories should list whether the company is a low-risk payment gateway (like Stripe, 2Checkout, Braintree, FirstData, etc.) or whether they are a high-risk payment gateway that allow higher chargeback ratios (like Soar, etc.). Also, that chargeback ratio limit needs to be crystal clear.

6. They need to work towards one single common API that's interchangeable among eCommerce API companies. There can be exceptions, yes, but educating these API companies on a good standard (like Stripe or Braintree's system) is really suitable.

7. The council needs to educate eCommerce API companies, without naming names specifically. If their API has docs that suck, or transactions run 2-4 seconds longer on them than any other provider, or they use one API server that both production and sandbox use (thus a sandbox DDoS would affect production too), or they don't encrypt their server data enough -- these things and more need to be explained in a blog along with videos so that eCommerce API companies can wise-up. Recommendations should go deep, too, such as explaining fault tolerance/redundancy strategies, data security standards, and so on.

8. Internationalization and banking charges need to be clear too. This council needs to help with that. It's so frustrating to learn an API only to find out that they only take USD, or don't process AMEX or some other type of card. It's so frustrating to see a great API but they have no internationalization options. It's so frustrating to find out that I can use the API properly, only to find out the bank where the money goes is in Slovenia, and, when it does a wire transfer into my bank, I have crazy bank fees along the way on a regular basis.",6,10,2016-07-19,ECOM,0.05329810455441475,0.9157809019088745,0.030921020545065403

I'm not sure wether this is the right subreddit, if not, please tell me where to ask my question. Thanks :)

We're currently trying to replace our internal ordering system for food, kinda like internal catering.
The problem we're facing is that the system needs to be relatively simple. We don't need a shipping address, we don't need recommendations, we don't shipping fare calculations,...
All we need is: Products ordered by category, a checkout with some custom fields (number to bill to, building number to deliver to, guests and a field for notes). The kitchen on the other hand needs a bit of a customised workflow on when the final bill is generated. The system will implement our own SSO and should be as simple as possible for the end users (frontend and backend). There will be no problem with performance since there won't be a lot of users. Oh and it should be easily update-able, if possible.

We looked more detailed into WooCommerce and Magento. But Magento seems to ""heavy"" and complex for our needs and WooCommerce kinda lacks real support and seems a bit complicated to customize about everything.

Can anyone recommend any eCommerce system we should look into ?

This has allowed me to uncover really valuable insights into which segments and marketing channels are making me money, and which are sadly not. I check the database regularly to watch the results of my marketing but no excel work is needed.  

I would love to speak with some store owners about this tool, what this information would be worth to you? what more would you need? Let's get a conversation going.

shopify,Installing Shopify app on a custom domain,"We are building a Shopify app for our platform, called [Swym Relay](http://swym.it). One requirement we are trying to mandate for the app install is for the user to install it on their custom domain, as opposed to their myshopify.com domain (we require this because of how the platform is implemented). When I try to test the app on a custom domain, Shopify seems to always refer to the original myshopify.com domain - I get the following error when I try this:

""The store URL you entered is not correct. Please try entering it again.""

Further, when I try to access the Admin module by referring to the custom domain, i.e. http://&lt;customdomain.com&gt;/admin, that always redirects to the store.myshopify.com/admin address. I suspect that this is part of the problem.

Does anyone know if this is the expected/documented behavior? Any suggestions on how we can get around this, short of letting the user install on the myshopify.com domain and then having them change the domain later? Is there a way during the install process to get the custom domain name?

My plan is to use multiple suppliers. My niche requires this, as there is no single site that would have enough products to choose from for this particular type of items. However, one thing bothers me a lot. How do I deal with the multiple supplier shipping if for example a customer orders 2 or 3 different items, but all the products are from different suppliers? My thoughts so far tell me to use some sort of a place where the current customer's orders are stored and then shipped from this place to the customer. I really hope there are companies that can do this for me, since I am from Europe and I will be selling only to US citizens.

I have been thinking about using Shipstation, but since I don't really have experience with it, I don't know if they can do this type of order gathering and shipping for me.

shopify,Influencer Marketing For Shopify Made Easy,"Okay Shopify loving Redditors, I wanted to thank you in advance for helping me and the team improve our SAAS app (more on that below). In order to do that, I wrote a guide that I hope you enjoy.


Let’s start with the assumption that you’ve already signed up to Shopify and built out your first cart. Chances are though you developed the eCommerce equivalence of Fermi’s Paradox though, wondering where everyone is. Cue Kevin Costner wondering why no one is showing up to his baseball field.


**Some basics**: Shopify does a pretty good job of trying to educate shop owners; it is in their best interest for you to succeed, so definitely spend an afternoon taking notes reaching through the [how-to-sell online](https://www.shopify.com/blog/topics/how-to-sell-online) section.  After you make your way through that you’ll hopefully have a better understanding on how to improve your overall search presence, are getting active in niche communities and in social media, are building up a relevant e-mail list, and are thinking “hey jsinkwitz, influencer marketing…weren’t you going to talk about that?” 


Oh, you know I am. I’m going to talk about it so hard. 


I’ve been around. As a 20 year veteran of the online marketing community, allow me to just disclaim that there’s nothing inherently new about influencer marketing. The same was also true of native advertising, content marketing, inbound marketing, etc. 


*Side note:  if some sleazy salesman tries to tell you that you can’t do SEO anymore and need to focus on inbound content marketing or some similar nonsense, run. The person is spouting bullshit and probably took a 1 day Hubspot course to make them an “expert.”*


Anyhow, the simplicity of influencer marketing is that you’re trying to get someone else to tell your story. Quick example? Hiring Tiger Woods to represent Ashley Madison. Wait, that’s a terrible example. Accurate, but still…bad Joe. Let’s go with Jim Gaffigan representing KFC, selling you on the virtues of consuming chicken – in this particular case he’s a spokesman, which is going to be well out of budget for most brands, but the concept in practice can be so much more effective, even if you can’t sign a contract worth 100lb of chicken/week and most likely the below methods will have a better impact on your bottom line.


There are many different types of influencer marketing campaigns you could create based on your goals; before you jump into any campaign or activity though it is my hope that you have a reason and purpose for whatever you’re doing. Nothing makes me sadder than someone spending money on an activity without knowing what they hope to accomplish. 


**Visibility on social and in niche communities**

This is the closest campaign to general branding and advertising that you can get using influencers; this is usually about expanding product awareness and is typically used by entrenched companies launching a new product or drawing attention to new features of older products. If you have been around for a while and are launching new line of bacon scented candles with an undefined customer, this can be a good first route. Obviously the more targeted you can make this, the better, so for the sake of it let’s say the general visibility would target influencers that have mentioned bacon a few times in their social profiles.


**Sales via undisclosed product placement**

Have you ever watched a college basketball game? These glorified shoe commercials are the analog equivalent to this digital concept. Using the above bacon scented candle example, an influencer giving a video interview at their kitchen counter and inhaling deeply at the obviously pleasing scent of cooking bacon, with imagery of the product you just happen to sell, right in the users video consumer’s face. Product packaging / branding needs to be obvious in order to work since the reviewer wouldn’t necessarily be calling attention to it. However, the bad news on this type of campaign is the FTC has since cracked down on this concept, requiring some degree of disclosure. It is best not to fight them. College basketball games sponsored by Nike are still okay though apparently.


**Sales via disclosed reviews**

Here we come to the most common use of influencer marketing: disclosed reviews. Keep in mind that some reviews are paid with cash money, some only cost the cost of product + shipping. This strategy is very effective in certain cases; if a known influential home decor mommy blogging chef snaps a photo of your bacon candle and posts on twitter that it smells better than the real thing, the influencer has provided a product review. Some reviews are more in-depth, such as YouTube unboxing videos of bacon candles and promoted blog posts on the virtues of buying bacon scented candles; there’s no limit to how deep a review can get with the right influencer that genuinely believes in your product.


**Sales via influencer promoting a giveaway/contest/promotion**

This strategy is not used enough, largely because it is a bit more complex than asking for a simple review. However, it is going to be a lot more impactful if you can structure it correctly. What do you think would get more sales: the influencer reviewing your bacon candle or the influencer that reviews your porky wax and says the first 10 people to use “GIVEMEBACON” code on your Shopify store will get a free mini sausage candle? When done correctly, that is the stuff of a viral campaign because you’re getting not just a review, but an incentive to share the review.


Have a good idea now on the type of influence campaign works best for your goals? Good, now let’s pick the best type of influencer, because not all influencers are built equal.


**Celebrity**

Obviously you’d love a celebrity with 1M+ followers on Twitter that is a certified bacon addict stating your candles make the world a brighter place. The reality though is celebrities expect a lot of cash money for their product related tweets/shares/snaps/instagrams; in the past year alone I’ve worked with many of these agencies have been created to specifically manage celebrity social presences, charging top dollar. They have their place, but does it really make sense for you right now? This isn’t to say that it is impossible for a small business selling bacon candles like yourself to snag a celebrity endorsement – Norm MacDonald maybe? It is simply less likely. Additionally, there is much more noise in celebrity influencer marketing, unless that celebrity also happens to be a subject authority.


**Authority**

I view authorities as minor celebrities in that they are highly respected in certain fields and communities. If I post on LinkedIn about a new content marketing service that changed my life, the tool is going to see at least a modest increase in sales since I’m a known quantity within the search community and content communities. If I share that I’m getting a pedicure, at best I can expect some intense comments. Authorities that aren’t really celebrities are more accessible too than their non-authoritative celebrity cousins, but for reputation reasons have to be more selective in what they choose to represent. Getting reviews from authorities is doable, but if it is an honest review you have to expect them to be more critical than Paris Hilton’s view of Carl’s Junior hamburgers. 


**Customer**

So that bacon scented candle of yours, you know who has seen it before? Your customer. Let’s say Bubba bought your sausage last month and you know from Google Analytics that he has been back a few times looking at your entire meat candle line. With a little effort in checking out his influence reach and a quick email to him, you could potentially land an influencer that is not only going to review your product favorably (I mean, the dude clearly loves the smell of cooking meat), but his 500 follower base means he is obviously not a talking head celebrity either. Bubba, lover of all things meat and candles loves your specific, and his peer level influence is going to act like a mini authority amongst his audience. 


You’re almost there, one last thing to talk about. You know what kind of campaign you want to run and which type of influencer is going to work best for you, so now you need to go out and get the influencers. 


**Push strategies: email, Twitter DMs, outbound phone calls, etc.**

If you ever find a quality substitute for hard work, be sure to let me know. On hacker news they’d refer to this as doing the things that don’t scale. Tracking down a phone number and email for an influencer and asking them to take part in your campaign is the idea. Don’t be discouraged though with a low response and acceptance rate, because it’ll happen; just like outbound sales, it is a numbers game with a constant need to push in order to get the results you want. And just like sales, bacon scented candles are for closers.


**Pull strategies: place an offer and get attention to it**

Sold as an inbound strategy by modern day marketers this old concept just means you could create a special offer page for potential influencers, share it on your site, over email, and social channels, and then correspond with all the message responses that come in. It works well if you have some baked in attention already.


Don’t think you can’t use push and pull strategies simultaneously; they aren’t mutually exclusive. If you spend a couple days building up an email list of potential consumers and instead of trying to directly convert them into paying customers, took an indirect route by getting a portion of them to run a giveaway review campaign for you, you might get that some bacon candle sales directly, some as customers later in the sales cycle + add more customers via the mini sausage candle giveaway. The entire process can be done manually and with great success.

ecommerce,How to Reduce your Involvement in your Ecommerce Business and Plan for an Exit,"Most bootstrap business owners are so focused on the day-to-day grind and growth of their businesses that there is rarely an alignment in the time they choose to exit and the time their business is ready for an exit. If this statement resonates with you, setting a robust business exit strategy in place now can both increase the sale value of your website later on, and also improve operational efficiency to drive greater profits today.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the most common characteristics of businesses built without an exit in mind is high owner involvement in everyday operations. This is common because business owners value their time lower than outsourced help, or fail to delegate and elevate key members of staff. While it may look good in your P&amp;L, most buyers are looking for businesses with streamlined operations that are easy to take over and scale. The reason behind this is simple: Time is money, so the potential for return on investment is diminished with each additional hour of owner involvement. When looking ahead of a sale, it’s important to have all of your daily responsibilities well documented, and delegated or outsourced whenever possible.

&amp;nbsp;

**A significant part of your business exit strategy should entail:**

1. Determining how many hours you spend each week on your business
2. Whether those tasks can be delegated or outsourced
3. Implementing any changes that will ultimately reduce owner involvement

&amp;nbsp;

We’ll talk about each of these steps and give you actionable tips and tools to help with your exit planning.

&amp;nbsp;

#How Much Time Do You Spend On Your Business?#

Too often, we get sellers making a ballpark guess to answer this question. If you’ve been running your e-commerce business for years and it’s second nature to you, it might seem like the intuitive way to go about it. But are you factoring in every task and taking into consideration how much time it might take someone who’s new to it?

&amp;nbsp;

A good way to determine your hours of weekly involvement is to keep a log, whether with simple pen and paper, in an Excel sheet or using a time-tracking tool like Harvest. Choose whichever option you’re most likely to adhere to, and do this over the course of one to two months. You may also consider rounding up for tasks that are complex, but to which you’ve become accustomed.

&amp;nbsp;

##Where Are You Spending that Time?##

Once you have a log of your weekly tasks and how long they take, you should take a high-level view of that data to find out the areas that eat up most of your time. If it’s not immediately clear because there’s a large number of small tasks that individually don’t take much time, you should categorize them then look at aggregate time spent on each category.

&amp;nbsp;

For an e-commerce business, your main areas will likely be:

&amp;nbsp;

- Content creation and SEO
- Paid advertising campaigns
- New product development and/or sourcing
- Inventory ordering and tracking
- Fulfillment
- Customer service

&amp;nbsp;

Knowing your most time-consuming operations is helpful in a few ways. Firstly, it allows you to pinpoint low value tasks that can be delegated or outsourced. Second, it will help you understand inefficiencies in the business and further streamline operations to reduce operating expenses, which can increase your valuation. Finally, it is also valuable knowledge for a potential buyer, who will want to know every detail about what running the business entails.

&amp;nbsp;

No matter what your tasks are, you’ll always have two options: outsource or hire in-house. Both have pros and cons, depending on the job and your particular needs, so we’ll break all of that down here:

&amp;nbsp;

#Content and SEO#

It’s important to have high-quality, optimized content on your website. For most e-commerce businesses, organic traffic is a big part of attracting new business, so having optimized content is key.

&amp;nbsp;

##Freelancers##

Freelance content writers are easily found on sites like Indeed or Upwork, but choosing an individual freelancer has its perks and drawbacks:

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**

- Can have high levels of expertise (particularly if you’re willing to pay well)
- Potential to become a loyal, valuable asset to your business
- Useful for one-off projects
- “Try-before-you-buy” test for future full-time employees

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**

- May take some trial and error to find a good fit
- Tend to operate on their own schedule; have no obligation to complete assignments that aren’t paid in advance
- Fewer chances for revisions versus an in-house member of staff
- May only have expertise in content or SEO

&amp;nbsp;

Whether or not hiring a freelancer is a good idea likely depends on your needs and your timeline. If you have highly technical products and your exit is still a year or two down the line, this could be a good option. Otherwise, you might look to an agency or hiring part- or full-time staff.

&amp;nbsp;

##Agencies##

Agencies will often assign a dedicated account manager and a creative team, as well as technical support, depending on the size of the agency. Agencies can range from full service offerings, like Fat Joe, to specific solutions, like the content-only services provided by Audience Ops.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**

- A single point of contact can save you time giving instruction or feedback
- Usually have a contract (i.e. a binding document stating what you’re owed and when you’re owed it) to which they have to adhere
- Can usually manage both content creation and SEO

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**

- Creative teams tend to be entry-level, so finding high-SME writers may require some trial and error
- Agencies often experience high employee turnover, so your team may change over the course of your contract
- Speaking of contracts, they can be hard to get out of…

&amp;nbsp;

If you require a high volume of content on a regular basis and require a full spectrum of support, using an agency is probably a good option. Otherwise, you may find it to be expensive and cumbersome if your needs are only occasional.

&amp;nbsp;

##Hiring a Staff##

Bringing on a staffer or two can be a great option if your cash flow supports salaried or hourly workers. The best part about this option is that a staff can support all of your needs – not just content and SEO – if you hire the right people.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**

- A dedicated team can help your business grow exponentially due to increased work capacity and creativity
- Staff members can provide you with perspective and feedback on your operations
- There is no limit to level of expertise or dedication – if you find good talent

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**

- Staff members often come with overhead costs, such as healthcare and office space
- Hiring and managing people can cost a lot of time upfront
- Employees may not stick around after an acquisition

&amp;nbsp;

Also, when hiring a staff, you need to consider that an employment contract is a commitment, even if the contract clearly states that the partnership can end at any time. Letting people go is never fun, so don’t hire anyone unless you have a necessary role to fill. That being said, businesses with long-term teams in place (even if remote) often receive higher valuations than those without.

&amp;nbsp;

#Inventory Management and Fulfillment#

If you own an e-commerce website, it’s likely that a large portion of your time is going toward managing inventory and fulfilling orders. While staff members would surely be able to help you with this, there may be better solutions available outside of your own company. Here are some of your options for reducing the time you spend on these tasks:

&amp;nbsp;

##Inventory Management##

Your products are the most important part of your operation – and they’re also likely one of your biggest expenses. As such, keeping track of inventory and balancing supply with demand is a key task. Make sure you have organized systems in place, are well aware of which products are core to your business, and have good understanding of your peak seasons. Businesses that frequently run out of stock do not provide a good customer experience, see lower rates of repurchase and ultimately, are valued lower.

&amp;nbsp;

By hiring someone to handle your inventory management, you may avoid costly mistakes, such as overselling, over ordering inventory or running out of stock before you can reorder. Below is a list of possible tasks that you could delegate to an employee:

&amp;nbsp;

- Keeping track of products in stock
- Ordering products
- Meeting demand without overstocking (knowing your seasonal trends and promotions calendar)
- Identifying the winning products and cutting the under performers

&amp;nbsp;

Although hiring someone to handle these tasks will free up your time, you can’t forget that you have to properly train them before they can be valuable to your business. This is where having well-documented and detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) comes in handy. Using a tool such as Sweet Process will make documenting everything simple and easy to follow. Whether you hire someone or not, you should use inventory management software in your business. This facilitates:

&amp;nbsp;

- Multi-channel management
- Automated, real-time updates
- Store integration for businesses that also sell on marketplaces like Amazon or Etsy
- Warehouse integration

&amp;nbsp;

##Fulfillment##

As your business grows, fulfillment will become a more time-consuming task. This is when you should consider bringing on help that will keep everything running like a well-oiled machined, no matter how big you grow. Depending on your situation, you have a couple of different options when it comes to hiring help.

&amp;nbsp;

###Fulfillment Centers###

If you currently handle all of the fulfillment on your own but your operation is outgrowing your space, then opting for a fulfillment center such as ShipWire or Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) might be your best option.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**

- Allow you to store your goods in a third-party location, which means you don’t have to worry about storage
- Will handle the packaging, inserts and any other branding involved with your packaging
- Quickly process and ship your items nationwide to ensure an on-time delivery with every order
- Lower shipping rates negotiated by the fulfillment centers on your behalf
- Gain greater exposure to clients (via Amazon Prime, if using FBA)
- Use of their inventory management software

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**

- The fulfillment centers will take their cut of the profits
- May not be the best option for larger e-commerce businesses
- Decreased flexibility on a product-to-product basis (i.e. custom touches like hand-written notes may not be possible)

&amp;nbsp;

###In-House Fulfillment###

If you are an established e-commerce business with a large range of SKUs and you own a warehouse, then it could make sense to build an in-house fulfillment team. In this case, your best option would be to hire a warehouse manager to run the fulfillment operation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**

- Higher margins (in most cases)
- Don’t have to compete with other companies for hours at the fulfillment centers
- Increased flexibility with branding and packaging

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**

- Makes your business location-dependent, which will likely lead to a lower valuation
- Unfavorable shipping rates versus fulfillment centers
- Forces you to handle all aspects of the fulfillment process, such as shipping logistics and importing
- Requires you to rent, lease or buy your own warehouse
- Can actually increase the amount of owner involvement

&amp;nbsp;

The biggest problem with handling fulfillment in-house is that it locks your business into that location, which severely limits the buyer pool for your business. Also, handling your own fulfillment adds to the total number of hours that are required to successfully run your business, which in the end will hurt the value.

&amp;nbsp;

#Customer Support#

Good customer support can make or break your business, especially in an age when consumers are so motivated by online reviews. One disgruntled client can scare off hundreds of customers, and, unfortunately, those are the ones most likely to leave a review. If you find yourself spending a lot of time answering questions or responding to complaints, think about how your website can be updated to simply prevent these messages. For example, an updated FAQ page can drastically reduce the number of questions you see coming through. Also, if you find that your customers are having similar issues with your products or service, it’s a good idea to fix those problems at the core – not just to save time, but your business.

&amp;nbsp;

Once you’ve addressed the root cause of any common questions or complaints, think about how your customers are contacting you and whether that can be simplified. It’s much more efficient to answer emails than it is to field phone calls, so you might want to replace that Contact Us number with an email address. There are no cons to updating your website and fixing your product or service, only pros, so do this first. If you’re simply overwhelmed with messages from your customers and there’s no quick fix to resolve the issue, you may consider using a support center. If you choose this option, however, make sure it’s a high-quality agency that vets its employees. When your customers are having a problem with your product, it may only worsen the situation if they have poor communication with the person whom they call for help. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some perks and drawbacks to using a call center:

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**

- Saves you time and negates the need for a hire
- Well-trained, professional customer service reps may be a big value add to customer experience
- Can often be more efficient than in-house services
- Can offer 24/7 services for an international client base

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**

- Many services utilize non-native English speakers, which can cause communication barriers
- Hard to ensure consistent quality, which can be damaging to your brand
- Expense may not be worth it if your calls are minimal

&amp;nbsp;

#Final Thoughts#

It can be hard to relinquish control of your operation. However, if you determine the areas in which you can securely unload your time burden, it will be well worth the end result. The business can simultaneously improve efficiency while driving costs lower, which will lead to more profits right now, and a higher valuation when you exit.

shopify,How do you setup Aweber and shopify integration,"Hi guys. I am new to Shopify. I have a shopify store and I have added the aweber app to the store.

My questions would be:
1. How do I create a list without double opt in.
2. How to import customers to aweber list. Because the app doesn't seem to be automatically doing it right now.

So far we have a pretty good offer messaging/management system and rapid offer page creation, but what features do you care about the most? I want us to build something that will make your life easier and put food on the table for me.


Here's a non-definitive list:

1. Influencer discovery -- (i.e. you say 'fashion' + 'Twitter' and we source some possible influencers for you).

2. Influencer outreach --(self-explanatory, but reaching out through a platform/system to let them know ""Brand X is interested in you; want to get free product in exchange for a review?""

3. Influencer recruitment -- (i.e. the quick offer page creation we already built + maybe some other features you find necessary)

4. Tracking -- this could be anything, because there are so many different variables from cart specific KPIs to various engagement metrics

5. Reporting -- hand in hand with tracking, but if there's reporting that you love, we can probably make it happen.


6. Verification -- one pain I know from running influencer campaigns as a brand is having to make sure the person did what was claimed to have been done.


7. Something else?

I'm after your expert advice on two things.

1) Split testing to gain conversions, views -&gt; purchases. What do you think would be the most important thing to test? Product price, product image, product title/meta title, product description, theme elements like the colour of 'Add to Cart' buttons etc.?

2) It feels like I'm getting a crazy number of abandoned carts lately - great that people are adding things to their carts, but why are they falling short of making the purchase? I'm wondering what things can I change that will help change those lonely carts into finding a new home.

I'm currently testing a different 'Add to Cart' button colour as previously it was the same pink and perhaps blended in with my overall theme. Not seeing any changes just yet.

shopify,Does anyone have experience with scripting?,"I need a custom script for my shopping cart and I'm not code-savvy.

1. Can I just inject the script into my site without having that app installed? (I don't necessarily want to upgrade my plan for this one feature)

shopify,Updating product SKU via API,"I feel as though I must be missing something when trying to use the Shopify API to update a product variant quantity, given its SKU.  Most web stores' APIs have a call specifically for this as it is a very common use case.

On Shopify, to update a product variant, I need its ID.  However, there is [nothing in the documentation about filtering products or product variants by SKU](https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/product#index).  We are [told by Shopify themselves to download every product and build a SKU-&gt;ID mapping in our database](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/shopify-app-discuss/fYRAdKRemvk).

However, in testing, I've found that Shopify's paging mechanism makes even this infeasible.  Whereas other web stores' APIs give you a paging token you can use to ensure you are getting a single snapshot of the data, Shopify does not.  So if someone deletes a product on the first page before I finish downloading the subsequent pages, as all of the records shift backwards one page, I will miss one.  As such, spurious SKU not found error messages come up occasionally as customers update their stores.

Additionally, the documentation does not specify that there is any kind of sort order in the results, and only some resources (such as orders) can be sorted.  So even if no products are added or change, there is no documented guarantee that page two follows page one.  Changing the filters does change the order, but [Shopify themselves say not to rely on this](https://ecommerce.shopify.com/c/shopify-apis-and-technology/t/question-about-the-sort-order-when-get-endpoints-with-since_id-parameter-205953).

At this point I'm looking at pulling down one at a time and using since_id to get the next one, as at least that shouldn't suffer from the page shift problem as people use the site.

That can't be right, can it?",1,2,2016-07-29,ECOM,0.1067611500620842,0.8711223006248474,0.022116508334875107

What would also be amazing would be any tips for adding an import_id or similar mechanism that I can search the API upon so that we don't need to maintain a separate bridging database of ID's and can simply find by import_id, POST if 404, PUT if 200.
