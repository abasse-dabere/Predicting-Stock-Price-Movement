ecommerce,suggestions for e-commerce site with blogging option,"Hi all!

I'm new to e-commerce and website building in general. Looking for an e-commerce platform that I can link up with a blog (maybe in the top navigation bar of the e-comm site). Goal is to keep up a blog for my apparel company to gain like-minded followers (it doesn't exist yet, so I don't have to worry about moving content), and keep a simple ""launch date"" landing page on the e-commerce portion until we get product in (probably not for 9-12 months).

I've done some research, but it started to make my head spin. Squarespace is on top so far - I love how user-friendly it is for a non-coder, and it does come with a built-in blogging platform. But I'm worried that because it's so ""pretty"", it might be lacking behind-the-scenes... anyone have experience with this?

Any advice or suggestions are SO welcome! Especially anyone who's worked with Squarespace e-commerce, or has suggestions for other platforms with blogging options.

ecommerce,Should I jump on the WooCommerce train?,"Need some suggestions, please.

I want to find a solid, *self-hosted* eCommerce platform (ie; no BigCommerce or Shopify).   I have my own servers and need to have that root level and FTP type access, but I digress.

**Magento:** I have spent way too much time trying to learn M1 and M2, but I (personally) just found it insanely difficult to use, and I don't really need it for the smaller stores that I build.  I haven't given up on it completely, but I am pretty frustrated with it and probably won't revisit Magento 2 for quite awhile.  It does appear that Magento is slowly fading away, even with the release of M2 last year.  

**PrestaShop:** I have been building a site on PrestaShop, and it's OK so far.  I've worked with about 5 different premium themes now from several reputable authors.  I think it's OK, but it's insanely difficult to import even simple product CSV, and I haven't been able to find any real community that is vibrant, so no real support is a bit discouraging.  But hey, it's free.

Now, I am pretty comfortable with WordPress, and I have built several WordPress websites.  It appears that WooCommerce is growing and has a much larger community then any other self-hosted eCommerce platform.  Would you guys agree?

I do remember one time I installed a test WooCommerce store, and once I logged into the backend - the Admin area didn't look like anything that resembled a typical eCommerce admin panel, so it turned me off to it at the time - mostly because I am thinking of my clients - they need to have a nice, intuitive, friendly and attractive Admin panel that isn't intimidating.  Something they can just login to quickly, manage orders, customers, etc all without issue.  

Also, I got the vibe from WooCommerce that is was really designed and suitable for a very small store that may sell a few products here and there.   Can WooCommerce be trusted and be suitable to handle the load of a solidified online business?  One project, for example, is a customer who is moving off of the ProductCart site I built him years ago, onto a 'modern' platform.  His business is already rolling and I am not sure how well WC can handle a heavier workload.

So, should I keep working and learning PrestaShop, or do you guys suggest I get with the game and explore WooCommerce a bit more?

**Most of all, I want to 'future-proof' my skills by investing my time into a platform that is going to be here for a while and will remain relevant in the future**.   Me building ProductCart stores is a perfect example.  I did well at it, but now it is a dying platform and I am trying to find a replacement that I can learn inside and out.

Or perhaps I should take a look at OpenCart?

I created an app for Shopify stores to get 1-tap feedback from customers, and reward them to boost customer lifetime value.

I hadn't been collecting emails, so I just set up a landing page to try and engage with website visitors more.

You can see it at www.GetFetch.ca

I appreciate any and all feedback, and would be happy to give a promo code to anybody who actually wanted to try the app.

The things I'm looking for most:
-Call to action text
-If you would give your name/number/email (or just 1 or 2 of them?)
-What you think of the grey background

ecommerce,Looking to start a digital monthly subscription service. Quick question regarding Wordpress.,"Hello, as the title states, I'm looking to start a digital monthly subscription service. The product I will be selling will be a digital download available on the website for members.

My question is regarding Wordpress. I'm wondering if it's possible to setup the following:

1) Have customers sign up on the website

2) Have customers choose their payment option (monthly, annually, etc)

3) Have payments go through on the last day of every month

4) Content becomes available on the first of every month. However, members can only access the download page if their most recent payment went through. If a member cancels their membership or their payment doesn't go through, they won't be able to access the downloads page

I'm not looking for an in-depth tutorial on how to do this, just wanted to make sure something like this would be possible to setup before diving head-first into the process. Thanks!

I want to sell Steam keys (these are unique codes) for video games. Each code is unique. So for example, one video game will have virtually an unlimited amount of codes and each code represents access to their version of that one video game when they redeem the code at Steam.

Is there any way I can input various codes so that Woocommerce offers the first code to the video game to the first buyer, the second code to the second buyer of the video game, the third code to the third buyer of the video game etc?

I cannot have the same code used over and over again because each code is only valid for one user.

The idea is start begin automating and doing deeper analytics on customers and products. The idea behind automation is that if a customer has gone say 90 days without an order, send them an email. Some product analytics I want to do is suggested upsells, ie the majority of your buyers bought product A and product B together so send an email to all customers who bought A and not B.

Shopify blog section- Most shopify themes have static blog pages... how could I make them more dynamic such as: http://www.avenue32.com/row/magazine/magazine-landing-page.html and https://moreislove.com/products/act/editorial/ ?",3,1,2016-05-15,ECOM,0.018845969811081886,0.9291766881942749,0.051977306604385376

shopify,Utilizing No-Inventory Model on Shopify - Payments Question,"What's up everyone!
My friends and I have been working on an e-commerce store idea for the last few days and we have a good chunk of it ironed out already.  We have agreed to go towards a ""no-inventory"" model, meaning we have a supplier willing to ship directly from their warehouse for the items we will be selling online.

My question is, if we are taking the payments from the customers on our store, will we then be able to use that money to pay our supplier to place the order and send it to our customer?

For example, we sell our product on our site but we don't physically have it.  A customer buys it off our site, the funds are sent to our PayPal or Stripe, are we then able to use those funds to purchase the product from our supplier, or will we have to wait for the weekly cycle to come through.

We're also thinking about using Paypal and Shopify Payments. Would we still be able to do what we need with payments in order to place the orders?

Any help would greatly be appreciated, as it can drastically change the way we would move forward with our idea.",16,2,2016-05-16,ECOM,0.020103933289647102,0.9193744659423828,0.06052160635590553
ecommerce,Testing demand for particular products - how ?,"Hi guys,

I haven't started any online shop yet, but I would like to start one soon. I'm thinking about selling fashion accessories with social channels mainly. I'd much appreciate feedback from experiences entrepreneurs. 

I chose fashion accessories because:
1) easy to store and ship cheaply
2) low returns
3) low basket size of 5-20 EUR (impulsive buying)
4) wide audience 
5) high CTR and low CPC on socials for 18-24Female (especially for sexy looking stuff)

Now, how can I test efficiently the demand for fashion accessories goods ? I was thinking about selecting around 10-20 accessories from Alibaba, then doing facebook ads for those using decent content. In this way I could get:
1) CPC
2) Cost per 'Buy' click (I was considering turning on-click 'Buy' button into lead gen)

This way, I could estimate breakeven on different points of margin &amp; conversion rates. 

What other ways are there to test demand for fashion accessories ? 

Kind regards,

I have recently opened my first e-commerce website and would love some feedback/critique from you guys and gals regarding the store.


I want to create a brand and sell original and high quality jewellery pieces. All the jewellery is designed by me, and actually made in the UK, I don't do AliExpress drop-shipping. I don't import cheap products from China for £1 and say it's unique and high quality, selling it for £50. I believe in being fair to the customers and providing actual value more than making a quick profit.


The brand is **Stone &amp; May**
Our website: **www.stoneandmay.com**
If you wish to check out the Instagram account and some photos theres, the user is: **stoneandmay**


Our products are available on eBay and Amazon as well, where it's all starting to pick up nicely. The website is getting a little traffic, but high bounce rates (50%) and low conversions.


As for marketing, we are only just starting, mostly natural IG growth and a bit of FB ads.

I have been playing around with [this code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34115452/how-to-change-add-to-cart-form/34134486#34134486) which adds a check box for adding to cart a simple product - this works great! What I am trying to add on to this is grabbing the Up-Sell product thumbnail.

I found that adding **&lt;?php the_post_thumbnail( 'shop_thumbnail' ); ?&gt;** between 

    // create the checkbox form fields and add them before the cart button
    add_action( 'woocommerce_before_add_to_cart_button', 'action_woocommerce_before_add_to_cart_form', 10, 0 );
    function action_woocommerce_before_add_to_cart_form(){
    global $woocommerce, $product;

    // get the product up-sells
    $upsells = $product-&gt;get_upsells();

    // store the number of up-sells and pass it on to the add-to-cart hook
    ?&gt;
    &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""upsells_size"" value=""&lt;?php echo(sizeof($upsells)); ?&gt;""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""wb-upsell-div""&gt;

And

    &lt;?php

    // iterate through all upsells and add an input field for each
    $i = 1;
    foreach( $upsells as $value ){
        $product_id  = $value;

ecommerce,"Working on service specific for eCommerce stores, would like to gauge interest","I am working on an eCommerce service for store owners and marketers and would like to see what everyone here thought. This idea is currently being developed and, yes this is currently live.

The idea is simple, you connect this to your store (Shopify, Magento, Woo, etc.) and the service does some deep analytics on the customer base, products, and orders. It does basic stats like average order value for customers, etc. but what makes this idea unique is that it allows you to score customers based on some of these stats. By scoring customers you get an idea of who you best and worst customers are. This is helpful because now if you are launching a special promotion or new product line, you hit up those customers with the higher scores. They will be more likely to convert because they have scored highly based on your business rules.

Scoring rules are something unique that not many people are aware of. The idea comes from a few places. I use to work at a call center years ago and customers were given a star rating. If the customer paid their bill, had a lot of channels, been with the company a long time, etc. they were given a higher rating. Deals and discounts were given out to customers with higher star rankings. More recently I worked at a marketing automation company which allowed salespeople to score the leads in the pipeline. Salespeople would would use this information to work the highest prospects and leads. The ideas aren't new, but this is new to eCommerce stores.

This benefits an eCommerce store and your customers because the scoring rules can be pretty much anything. Some rules I'm using now are based on average order value, days since the customer was created, order count, days since last order, total revenue, and some others. One of the more unique rules is based on email address. So users that have certain email addresses (@gmail.com, @hotmail.com, etc.) have their score adjusted.

So is this something that you would find useful or have questions about? If you would like to take a look at the site I have currently it's lvl67.com (until I can come up with a better name). How many eCommerce stores do you manage? Do you do any marketplaces (eBay, Amazon, etc.)? Do you currently do any type of winback campaigns or marketing direct to customers?

Thanks everyone, I'm really looking forward to everyone's feedback (positive and negative).",3,2,2016-05-21,ECOM,0.025263478979468346,0.9217013120651245,0.053035225719213486

ecommerce,Considering Ecommerce site with limited amount of products,"I am considering starting an ecommerce site connected to my discussion forum. The forum is doing fine, thats why I think I will have the traffic for the online shop too. 

Now, I definitely cannot fight the big guys with their huge selection, so I was considering to offer just limited amounts of selected products. Many people join discussion forums, because they are overwhelmed by the amount of options and look for reviews and opinions about which product to buy. Lets say we're looking for a laptop, there are literally thousands of options in any budget, so you join computer forum to try to filter them out. 

My idea is to create my ecommerce site in a way that the products are already pre-selected based on good reviews, thus saving the hassle for the customer to filter them out himself. Instead of 100 laptops at 1000$, I will offer 5 that are really good. 

Do you think this approach makes some sense or in general people are looking for large selection, even though most of it is white noise?",4,4,2016-05-22,ECOM,0.021862423047423363,0.9238977432250977,0.05423987656831741

ecommerce,Customer Digital Uploads: Single Order and Subscription Questions,"I'm looking for ecommerce software that accommodates the following functions.

Single Purchase:

Customers choose a price package for what level of services they want. They then upload individual files (as many as they want), and the rate for the chosen package is applied for each file uploaded. For example, the customer chooses a package that includes basic features, which is set at $5 per upload. The customer then uploads 10 items (or as many as they need) to be processed. The total bill is $50 in this case.

I can't seem to find a service that will let me bill per each customer upload. The closest I've seen (that looks clean and functions well) is WooCommerce Upload My File, but here it looks like I have to set a product price and then the customer can upload as many files as I allow, but it does not bill the customer per upload.

Subscription Purchase:

Users purchase a subscription option, where they pay x-amount per annual subscription and can then upload up to 100 items to be processed. In other words, customers would purchase the subscription for a term (1 year) but their number of allotted uploads would be capped at a set number during that term, or until the subscription was renewed. Kind of like a movie subscription where you can only download up to 20 movies per term, then you reach a limit and have to renew the subscription, buy a better package that allows more downloads, or wait until the next pay cycle. Only with my store, it's for user uploads.

Any suggestions for software that provides these functions is greatly appreciated.",0,3,2016-05-22,ECOM,0.02267805114388466,0.9252185821533203,0.05210336297750473

Next, I started an AdWords campaign target for keywords like: erotic hypnosis, hypnosis for women, erotic hypnosis for women (which to me seemed like a good idea)

I got about 47 click and stopped the campaign because results were just poor. 53% of visits were 10 or less seconds long :O
33% were between 10 - 60 second long.

It tells me very clearly that... my landing page simply sucks... and it sucks hard. But it's really difficult for me to tell what the heck might be the problem. And it would be just amazing if you could share you feedback here.

ecommerce,Just starting up. Looking for some reviews and tips!,"Hi! About a week ago I started up an online store with my boyfriend. I figured that I could still be able to manage one in between my hours at my part-time job in retail and my upstarting art career. Since I'm pretty experienced handling photoshop and my boyfriend is a professional photographer, we figured we could combine our skills to create a store that's at the very least aesthetically pleasing.

We're both very crafty people and really enjoy making things from scratch with our hands. We're planning on starting with easier-to-make home and bath-type products such as soaps, lotions, fragrances and candles and then later including things such as jewelry and other fashion accessories, which we already have experience making for ourselves.

Here's everything we managed to put together so far: http://wildsage.storenvy.com/

We have our soap listed and we also have some candles and sugar scrubs that we haven't been able to photograph yet. We're planning on taking everything we've made so far and selling it at a local three-day art festival next weekend to help promote the store. (A friend of ours owns a property right across the street from the festival and lets us set up every month for other events.)

I have a couple questions that I'm hoping some of you might be able to answer!

1.) About how much should I be investing financially at this point and when will I know when to take it up to the next level? So far I'm keeping products in a made-to-order manner, that way I'd be able to immediately pay for any materials I may need to buy, such as oils and lye to make soap. This is working so far since our only buyers have been friends and friends-of-friends.

2.) Is there much of a difference between having a custom domain name and simply using a domain on storenvy? I understand that it may seem slightly more professional, but I don't know if we should use one since at this point it seems to be an unnecessary expense and the labeling I made already has our storenvy URL on it. 

3.) What all are the benefits of selling on more than one platform? In other words, selling on Etsy, Ebay, Amazon, and sites other than Storenvy? I'm slightly reluctant to start more than one since I'd imagine it would be a little difficult to keep track of stocks if I were to start making products ahead of time. 

4.) What would be the best next steps for us to take? Should we continue to put out more kinds of products or keep our selection smaller and focus more on promoting ourselves? Would having sales or coupons be a good method of attracting customers this early? If so, what would be some good ideas for some sales?

I would also be very thankful for any reviews or tips that would help us out!",3,6,2016-05-23,ECOM,0.021978996694087982,0.9230661988258362,0.05495481565594673

shopify,Zip code verification for credit cards (and auto-decline for failure) - is it necessary?,"Hi - 

We've always auto-declined cards that fail zip code verification on our Shopify site (using Shopify payments), but we've had ongoing issues with international customers (particularly from Austria) and it seems to be related to zip code verification.

Shopify support says I can likely solve the problem by disabling the auto-decline feature for zip code verification (we'll still get a ""medium fraud warning"", but no auto-decline), but they don't recommend doing so (their solution was to speak to these customers and manually input their orders in these situations, and they weren't even sure if that would work - and that seems potentially slow and painful when dealing with international customers in various time zones with varying levels of English speaking ability).

Has anyone else done this? Have you had any trouble with fraud afterwards?

ecommerce,E-Commerce Email Marketing Expert [AMA],"Hey everyone,

I run an agency that specialises in email marketing for e-commerce stores, specifically cart abandonment emails.

If you've not got your email marketing together - even a really basic system - your store is leaving a massive amount of money on the table. You'll see all sorts of stuff tossed around but it was estimated about $4 trillion (yes...trillion) of products are abandoned annually (http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-retailers-can-reduce-shopping-cart-abandonment-and-recoup-billions-of-dollars-in-lost-sales-2014-9?IR=T) but these stats are a few years old and while the actual rate of cart abandonment changes, e-commerce is growing by double-digits annually as more people come online.

Anyway, I digress! When we get involved with a client, we typically like to start by:

1) Loading a popup into their site to start building out their list. You can see this in action on www.dodocase.com who offer a voucher in return for a visitor's email address. The added bonus of doing this? Customers don't abandon your checkout in search of a coupon code just before they buy!

2) Setting up email marketing automation from the bottom of the sales funnel and working up. Customers who abandon right before actually paying for your products are also the ones who are most likely to come back and finish their purchase. While you'll find there are way more people higher up the funnel, the smaller number who are close to converting are the easiest to win back.

3) Once we've got these systems in place, we work outwards building in email marketing automation systems to recover abandoned carts, build rapport with new visitors and even offer behaviour-driven emails like product abandonment e.g. ""You looked at this iPhone case, we've still got one for you in your basket but there are only 2 left in stock!""

I know you guys are incredibly busy but email marketing is an incredibly overlooked marketing channel that as a rule-of-thumb, blows everything else out of the water in terms of ROI. The added bonus is that it's incredibly easy to track your performance and attribute a $XX return for a $YY spend.

Just check out the stats for a campaign we set up for a new client at the start of the month:

shopify,Blacklisting a customer,"Hi all, 

I recently started a store and things are ticking along pretty well, but I had my first bad experience. A customer bought a model kit and then claimed it was missing components. I wholly expect this is a lie, as i had two in stock and have the shipping weights when they arrived (identical).

Now, there's not a lot I can do to prove it's fraud, and instead of causing an issue I've just cheerfully offered to replace the parts from the other set and I'll just work it out with the supplier - I'm out $10 in shipping and a few hours. I'll add that i am running razor thin margins, particularly on this item, as I'm trying to do volume for better stock and shipping prices. 

Anyway, I don't want to sell anything else to this customer. Is that the wrong idea? Should I just carry on as normal and actively deny him service if there is another problem like this? Should I get an app to just block him from further purchases immediately? 

Any input would be greatly appreciated!",8,1,2016-05-24,ECOM,0.5923928022384644,0.3754810392856598,0.03212612867355347

The idea here is to convert a casual, anonymous lurker into an active brand advocate.
A distinguishing feature is the *gamification* add-on which enables store owners to award points, badges, and boosters with a fully managed leaderboard to create a fun user experience.

ecommerce,Leasing your ecommerce existence from an autocratic Shopify vs. the constant security do-it-yourself patches of WooCommerce?,"I've tried both and I really do like Shopify better...however...

Shopify can change their plans, rules, and fees at any point and you are basically forced to comply when they do so. The trade off is that they make it very easy and nearly carefree to run your own business online (regarding security).

WooCommerce does give you a little more freedom and more ownership over your online store but the downside is that WordPress and WooCommerce security is constantly under attack and you need to be constantly proactive in making sure you and your customers data is protected and secure.
