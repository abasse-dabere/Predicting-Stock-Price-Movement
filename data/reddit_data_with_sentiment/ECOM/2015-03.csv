woocommerce,Question about transactions,"I haven't set up woocommerce yet, but I have been looking into it. My employer likes my idea of turning his existing site into a mini store.

The facts: I work for a franchise branch of the business. Corporate head quarters have a store. Currently we have a link on our site that goes to that store. The business is a medical practice. If someone is already registered as a lead of my boss in sales force and they buy from the corporate hq store he gets credit. However, if they haven't registered yet their purchase doesn't give him credit.

We want to turn his site into a mini store so he will get credit. I would be linking the corporate hq paypal account to the woocommerce.

My question is: when a customer makes a purchase will the paypal account that gets the money be able to see it came from our domain and not the main store?

To make things less confusing, our domain is www.cenegenics-az.com and I am wondering if I can set up some kind of notice on all transactions on our site that say it came from that domain, as opposed to this other domain [www.cenegenicsstore.com]. I am aware the second domain is undergoing maintenance. I don't manage that one anyway and it doesn't matter that it is undergoing maintenance.

So to be clear: can I set up a tag for all transactions on my domain or is that automatic?

thanks!",2,2,2015-03-01,ECOM,0.04522015526890755,0.9327818751335144,0.021998027339577675
ecommerce,"""log in"" or ""contact us"" for wholesale prices?","I will offer a small product selection, with an assortment of color choices per season, for retail customers. I would eventually like to wholesale to physical retailers (non-ecommerce resellers) and offer them the ability to order colors/styles customized exclusively for their store. I do not have any retail nor wholesale prospects yet.

Should I aim to build a ""log in for wholesale prices"" type of store front/back
OR
Should I go an easier route and make a nice /wholesale/ about page with a ""call to inquire"" type of offer?

I worry if wholesalers will skip over me for not having an online order inquiry system, or if they will be annoyed when (hopefully) they become committed and have to e-mail/call orders in every time. Am I overthinking?

Sidenote: As my products are hand-crafted, I don't plan to scale in volume, so I want to have as much access to my customers as possible (either directly or through small businesses). It is something I thoroughly enjoy doing and want to sell to and build relationships with people who appreciate my product as much as I do.",7,2,2015-03-01,ECOM,0.018348589539527893,0.9176400303840637,0.06401136517524719

ecommerce,What are your experiences with online fraud and chargebacks?,"Just found this sub.

I am a developer in the UK that has worked in ecommerce for 14 years, 9 of which as a developer of Fraud prevention software for 2 large well established companies.

What I have noticed is that there doesn't seem to be many options available for small to mid-sized retailers to protect themselves against online fraud and chargebacks.

With this in mind I have co-founded a company specifically to deal with this problem as I know card fraud costs UK online retailers hundreds of millions every year.

I know that some of the e-payment providers supply built in fraud prevention technologies into their gateways but these seem rudimentary at best. My question to owners of online businesses is this.

What is your experience of fraud - how much does it cost you? How reasonable are the banks in dealing with chargebacks and lastly, would you outsource your fraud and risk management to a third party if the product was exceptional with years of experience behind the principle developers, especially if it were guaranteed to save you more than it costs?

As well as this any information as to your experiences with Fraud / chargebacks would be greatly appreciated.",13,5,2015-03-02,ECOM,0.05257250368595123,0.8880945444107056,0.05933291092514992

ecommerce,"Help me vent. Strangers are rude, and I don't get it.","I just fielded an email from a customer of a client.  He was unable to recover his password.  This not being the first time someone had a similar issue, I asked if he had created an account.

_

The client had a website before I worked with them. It did not have user accounts.  Customers would simply make purchases.

When I built the new site, I implemented user accounts.  For some reason, once in a while a user sends an email that they cannot recover their password.

So I ask, have you created an account?  I noted that as of a certain date last year, our new site was operational, and the old site was gone.

This particular person decided he would be rude, and made a nasty comment about transferring over user data.  Specifically that I should fire myself.

Yet, there wasn't any user data.  He assumed that because he had made purchases in the past, he had created an account.

Where do these people come from?  I am trying to help, and this moron decides to be a prick, and at the same time demonstrates that he has no clue.  There was NO WAY TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT OF ANY TYPE ON THE OLD WEBSITE.  Yet, you sat there trying to recover a fucking password, then told me I was incompetent because the imaginary data wasn't transferred to the new site.

I replied that there were not accounts on the old site, I started work with the company at x date, and if he needed further assistance he should contact person y.

ecommerce,What is the right way to expand my ecommerce business?,"I started a Shopify store in April selling pet products. I tested the market by drop shipping a couple items and once there was proven demand I got a business credit card and ordered inventory for the first time.

Fast forward 11 months later and I have about $15,000 revenue and a healthy profit margin. 

I sell 3 products all of them have size/color variations. 

The past year was all about process improvement and SEO/online presence. Moving from USPS Flat Rate to USPS First Class saved me over 50% in shipping costs alone and make me want to kill myself for not doing it sooner. My site has been hovering within the 1-3 spot in google searches for our top 4 keywords/phrases. 

My add to cart rate is about 10% and my conversion rate is hovering around 4%.

I now want to scale the business. I would like some advice on next steps.

I know I need to start offering more products, which is fine. But the space to store that inventory is minimal where I currently live, so I would probably have to move to Amazon FBA for fulfillment. 

I have also considered reaching out to other online retailers and seeing if they will drop ship for me as I get decent traffic.

ecommerce,[X-post from r/entrepreneur] Men's Lifestyle Business - Feedback Appreciated!,"Hey everyone,

I'm a young entrepreneur operating out of Toronto, Canada. Late last summer, I decided to make the jump and start this company. In short, we sell authentic men's home and grooming products. Right now, we have two main collections: candles, and bar soaps. Since launching, sales have been steadily increasing (don't want to disclose actual figures). Looking to keep growing and expand outside of just eCommerce sales, and getting into retailers too.

It's been a great journey so far; we've come a long way, and have gained a ton of experience. Biggest learning experience was when in November, a large supplier of ours dropped out of business. We had to haul ass to get everything together, but managed to sort that mess out before Christmas time.

Throughout the process, we've also re-evaluated our approach to selling products, and who we define as our target audience. Right now, we're definitely a lot more aligned with our customer base than initially, and we're building some solid relationships. Instagram has been a pretty successful platform in terms of driving sales for us.
We also redesigned our website in the past few days. Last time I posted here, I got a lot of really great feedback, and I'd love to get your thoughts. All criticism is welcome. Would love all of your help!

So as the title says, I'm building a multi-vendor marketplace where I would like to be the central product gateway and control all admin aspects of products (adding, approving, editing), and then the vendors can choose from that library to set their own inventory aspects (pricing, availability, shipping, deals). 

I've looked at EDD, but want to go with WooCommerce. I grabbed WC Vendors, and to be perfectly honest, the functionality may be baked in there already, but I thought I'd do that rare thing of asking before I built it so I don't have to go back and start over.

ecommerce,Please give me some guidance,"I was asked to make a new website for our business at work. We sell personalised directors chairs as well as a few other niche items. The business is around 50% Online and 50% B2B. We're a very small team, 2 of us now with a small warehouse. Average monthly revenue for the 3 years on the old system was around £4k. The chairs are imported from several different factories and vary from £35.99 to £167.99 retail.

I joined the development in August '14 with no previous knowledge of e-commerce. They had an existing online store hosted on Sellerdeck. It was an absolute mess in my opinion, both on the front and back end. [Have a look here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20140517081005/http://personaliseonline.co.uk/) There was no real inventory control either. 

Come December I decided the old system was a lost cause, and we'd be best off starting over. I came up with a new site on Shopify. It needed to be cheap and control the inventory well. Our products are combined of 2 or more variants so inventory control can be difficult.

Here's a link to the [new site](http://www.personaliseonline.co.uk/). 

I use Stitch and Stripe for phone payments, inventory and Amazon &amp; Ebay marketplaces. Shoppad for mobile. I use Google Analytics to see which changes are effective. Our bounce rate has leveled out at around 50% now. The mobile rate was in the high 80s until I added Shoppad. In Feb we made around £16.5k revenue.

Bu büyümeye karşın elektronik ortamda alışveriş yapanların sayısı henüz yeterli seviyeye ulaşmamış durumdadır. Türkiye’de ortalama 35 milyon internet kullanıcısı bulunmaktadır ve bu rakamın sadece %4,5 luk kısmı internet üzerinden online alışveriş yapmaktadır.

İnternet üzerinden alışverişte insanların çekindikleri noktaların başında güvenlik endişesi gelmektedir. Kalkınma Bakanlığının hazırladığı eylem planına göre de e-ticaret‘in güvenli hale getirilmesi için bazı önlemler alınması kararlaştırılmıştır. E-ticaret modeli üzerinden alışveriş yapmak isteyen tüketiciler için gerek e-ticaret için talebi artırmak gerekse güvenli bir alışveriş ortamı oluşturmak adına [güven damgası](http://www.gokhansezer.com/e-ticaret-sitelerine-guven-damgasi-modeli) sistemi oluşturulacaktır.

Güven damgası sistemi e-ticaret siteleri için belirli standartlara uyma zorunluluğu getirecektir. Güvenlik, kanuna uygunluk, müşteri memnuniyeti, hizmet kalitesinin artırılması, kayıt dışı durumların ortadan kaldırılması gibi belirli şartların sağlanması durumunda e-ticaret sitelerine güven damgası verilmesi, böylece e-ticaret hacminin artırılması hedeflenmektedir.

[Güven damgası](http://www.gokhansezer.com/e-ticaret-sitelerine-guven-damgasi-modeli) sisteminin hayata geçirilmesi için yapılan planlama ise şu şekilde;

[E-ticaret](http://www.gokhansezer.com) sitelerine yönelik standartları içeren bir belgelendirme yapılacak.

E-ticaret siteleri ve tüketicilere güven damgası sisteminin sağlayacağı faydaların  neler olduğu konusunda bilgilendirme faaliyetlerinde bulunulacak.

Tüketici ve e-ticaret firması arasında oluşabilecek anlaşmazlıklara karşın çözüm süreci ve mevzuat belirlenecek.

Müşteri bilgilerinin saklanması ve güvenliğine ilişkin standartlar ve olası yaptırımlar belirlenecek ayrıca denetleme ilgili kurumlarca yapılacak.

As product companies and retailers work to consolidate their channels to create seamless, integrated brand experiences for consumers, having access to data from each channel becomes increasingly critical to engage customers effectively.

My colleague recently wrote about the different ways product marketers can use data from marketplaces like Amazon as part of their overall retail strategy, and how marketplaces sales impacts other retail channels like product websites.

ecommerce,A request for a website review/marketing advice,"Hey folks,
I've spent the past year or so working on building my [small business ecommerce website](http://www.denexa.com). I'm running WordPress with WooCommerce. I'm pretty happy with it, other than the fact that I have a low conversion rate. Key points:

* I have a pretty low traffic rate. Google Analytics is showing an average of 11.63 sessions per day over the last 30 days—that's low, right? I have been working on SEO and have reached the top of page 3 of Google for my most important keyword, but I know that's not good enough. I have tried AdWords in the past, but I lost money on it. I've improved my site since I pulled the ads, though, and have considered another stab at it.
* I have a number of social media accounts but they all have fairly low follower/fan/like/etc. rates (for example, my Facebook posts usually reach less than 10 people), so I don't think they are appreciably contributing to conversions. I'm not sure how to increase the follower rate on these accounts in an ethical way.
* I need more products. I am working on this, but developing new products takes time and money. The main product I want to sell is the cards, but I am adding some other products that will supplement them and make the store look more full.
* I posted a similar query to another subreddit and got a lot of criticism from people unfamiliar with the product saying that the price was too high—I've done the market research here and I'm squarely in the middle of the market (my biggest competitor's cards sell for $31). I'm not concerned about this (especially since I've had sales—mostly offline—since that post).

My two main questions are 1) how can I help boost my website's traffic and 2) once I get them there, how can I increase the probability that they will convert? Are there any obvious red flags that will hinder conversions?

Thanks for your time and I'm looking forward to your replies.",6,2,2015-03-14,ECOM,0.028330525383353233,0.9255958795547485,0.04607356712222099

dropship,Are people really making that much listing items that they haven't even bought yet? (E.g listing something on eBay that you plant to buy from amazon IF it sells),"Am i missing something? Doesn't seem viable? seems dangerous and prob against both site terms of service?

Drop shipping is new to me, Not the concept i have been wanting to do it for years, always ended up back to just creating online stores for amazon affiliates and did better at that than anything else. and still not that well. 

But this amazon option wouldn't work for someone in Australia anyways, would it? 

What are my best options? 

Is it finding a unique product that has been made in Australia and selling via web store? 

or selling products to Americans from American drop shippers? or importing from China and selling to Australia via web store? the list goes on and on? All i seem to find on the internet is out of date blogs (over a year old) and generic websites build to sell ebooks and courses and are full of crap.

Does drop shipping happen much in Australia? shipping from China is actually not that bad to us in Australia and i find i receive most items within a few days.. But i guess I'm in the same boat as everyone else as I know how to build a site and i know how to get traffic to it, but no idea how to find a niche and how to find a dropshipper.... I do have experience in one certain hobby field and figure it is prob better to work in a field that i enjoy than one i know nothing about, but it's a pretty highly competitive market so would you advise against it? I do also own domains in that field and have other plans to build value but to create a community takes years...

So anyone willing to have a chat and talk about some of these for me? 

EDIT: of course i have tried googling aswell to find dropshippers, but most searches nowadays just link to sites explaining a bunch of crap to sell an ebook rather than give you some information.",4,3,2015-03-18,ECOM,0.030554549768567085,0.9313896894454956,0.03805576637387276
ecommerce,Translating Product Descriptions With HTML Tags,"I'm in the process of migrating inventory systems at the moment, and the solution we're migrating to has a link with the Google/Bing translation APIs to make these things easy.

The trouble I'm facing comes in the fact that our product descriptions are laced with HTMl tags to make them pop on the likes of Amazon and eBay. As far as running a straight automation go there's no way to translate the descriptions from English to German, for example without destroying the HTML tags and trashing the formatting.

ecommerce,Becoming a Boss on Shopify: Your 5 step guide,"So you want to run your own E-commerce store?  Live the location independent lifestyle?  Become your own boss? Learn to sell online?  Build your E-commerce business into a passive income stream that will pay you for the rest of your life? This is the place to get started, you are in the right place! Our goal is to get you setup online and getting sales rolling in.  We are here to answer your questions and help you from just starting out to more advanced strategies (taking it to the next level).  This post is all about the things you need to take care of in the beginning. Start simple and start planning!  Take things one step at a time, building an online store is not as hard as you may think.

 

1. Set Goals and Project Milestones

First things first, we need to set some goals.  What are we trying to achieve?  When are we going to do it by? Overwhelm can set in with all the tasks that go into setting up a store and launching.  Turn this into a new venture and become a project manager; break all your tasks up into bit size chunks and start biting them off, one by one.  For my Shopify site development of Mule Ties www.muleties.com  - I used a tool called Asana to break the project down.  There are many other tools like microsoft project, or basecamp;  work with what you're comfortable using.  I created a project and gave myself a 3 month time line to go live with my Shopify business.  Stick to your timelines wherever possible, things will come up but just grind it out!  People tend to procrastinate, you may be held back by the fear of the world wide webernets...it's not that hard. Just jump in and let yourself make mistakes.

So, using Asana I broke the project into small tasks like the following:

Pick your niche and what you will sell
Buy a URL and hosting
Design a logo
Pick a theme
Write store content: About Page, Shipping, Returns Policy, Contact Page
Add products to the site
Setup a business entity
Create social media twitter, instagram, facebook page, pinterest, and any other social media
This isn't a complete list but hopefully gives you an idea of the process.  The goal for now is to see the vision of what needs to be completed, remember bite sized chunks. Getting your store up and running will be a huge accomplishment, this is one step in the right direction to getting your first sale.  Now your project is all planned out, what should you do next?

We need something to sell!  And no, you probably can't ship washing machines across the country. Think small. If you don't have a product in mind then do a little research and find yourself a niche.

 

2. Find a Product/Niche

You are probably thinking to yourself that there is nothing to sell.  Everyone is already doing it! But the fact is there is a niche waiting for you, it could be that it's hard to find certain products in your city.  Or hard to find online, or maybe you found a way to source it cheaper.  Whatever it is there is room for you to play in many different industries.  Finding a product/niche can seem hard at first. Just know that it's easier than you think.  Look at yourself, what are you interested in?  What are some of your hobbies? Do you like fashion? Are you the artsy type?  Can you create anything yourself? You don't have to create something brand new to be successful at commerce, just pick something you know a lot about or gets you really excited. Do your research but don't spend too many months deciding, sometimes its better to jump and a learn! (Fail Forward my friends).

If you are still struggling in this area take a look at the ecommercefuel blog.  Andrew writes a fantastic article all about niching down by adding value, targeting the right customer, and picking the right product. I(we?) also recommend downloading his ebook which gives us fantastic little gems like this one:

The $100 to $200 price range is large enough for you to make a reasonable profit per order (assuming your margins are good and you provide value) without having to provide extensive personal phone service. Most people won’t balk at placing an order for a $150 item over the internet. This helps you invest up front in high quality content and mostly automate the ordering process online, allowing you to scale easily and without significant support and sale expenses.

Download the ebook here and learn from another great resource.  Lastly a quick note: you will want to pick a product that you can possibly expand upon later.  For example if you wanted to sell plates and bowls, you could also sell cups at a later time.  Leave yourself room to expand, but for now focus, focus, focus!

 

3. Build Your Online Store

Building your store is the fun part! If you are not the developer type then either get one on your team through equity share or pay someone to help you learn. You want to create something unique and it needs to look good. Otherwise you will lose credibility right off the get go.  Shopify offers a 14 day trial of their platform in order to get started.  This will give you the time to stumble around and get familiar with the platform and also the power to start designing your store.  Shopify provides a log in page to your store to keep it private until you're ready to go live. Before continuing I recommend going through the build your store exercise to get familiar with the platform

Picking a theme

Shopify offers many different themes to choose from within the Shopify Theme Store. Check out the themes and pick a theme that represents your vision for your store. Themes can range from $0 to $250 and higher if you want a custom design. Install the theme and get comfortable using the backend of the platform as this is where you’ll be running your store.

Adding products to your store

From my experience I recommend having product pictures with white backgrounds, the picture needs to be clear. The customers need to sold based on the photo. We purchased a white box and a Nikon camera when we first started our Shopify business but eventually resorted to using an iPhone (works great).  You can use the white box photo editor on Fiverr to edit the photos to have a white background.   For each product create a detailed description, include things like size, colour and other features. The description will also help customers find your product through Google search. So do your best to write an informative description.

Buying a url

Shopify provides a url for your store but it usually isn't custom (i.e: 'storename.myshopify.com').   It's recommended that you purchase your own url and redirect traffic to your Shopify store.  Customers won't be able to remember your full store url, pick something easy to remember.   Go to either godaddy or bluehost and purchase a simple url that customers will be able to spell.

Setup payments

There are numerous payment gateways that you can setup, at the beginning don’t implement them all (1 or 2 is fine for now).   A good start is to use Shopify payments which is powered through stripe. This way you can accept major credit cards and also setup Paypal.  Here’s a link if you would like to find out more information about Shopify payment gateways.

Setup shipping

Set this up in your own country first, get comfortable with shipping closer to home. Next, open your store up to all North America, Internationally, or your specific region. I created shipment costs of $8.95 for any order under $65 and orders over $65 free (within Canada). Choose shipping fees that fit your area of the world.

4. Build your brand

We talked a little bit about brand in the previous section, it's worth touching on in more detail. You can do a lot using online tools instead of paying thousands of dollars to top notch designers. Sites like Fiverr and 99designs can greatly reduce this cost. Fiver allows you to create logos, banner designs and a lot more. 99designs is a little more expensive but you will get a higher quality product in the end. You are able to choose the design you like the most out of many submissions. You could even create designs for your packaging on 99designs, but for now just focus on branding basics. You will also want to think about your products and how they will be viewed on your site.

If you take a look at MuleTies.com you will find a common theme among all the products: jewelry, watches, ties, bowties, and other fashion accessories. The overarching theme is obviously fashion. Take the same approach when you build your brand, we alluded to this in point number two (If you sell cups and plates you could also sell bowls). For your brand you will want to think of something that ties into what you are selling. You want the theme of your products to match your brand and your brand to match the look and feel of your site. This also ties into how you will eventually start marketing your site, we have a more detailed post on commerce SEO being written, so stay tuned! Briefly on this topic...you want to narrow down your keywords and social media hashtags. Be specific on what you are selling AND what you think people will be searching for.

5. Utilizing Social Media

Social media is one of the best ways to attract customers to your commerce site, all you need to do is post once a day and that's it...

No we are just kidding, this is NOT the case! Social media IS a great way to attract traffic to your site but it is by no means the only way and it's a little more involved than posting once/day. You don't have to be on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all day either...there are ways to automate this process!

You do not need to be on every social media outlet, choose them strategically. If you are selling craftier products then for sure be on Pinterest. Use your best judgment on where you will get the most traffic for your efforts. When we launched our first business we started out with Twitter. The business used Twitter for 6 months in order familiarized ourselves it’s benefits, we then got into automating the process then moved onto the next social media tool. Make everyday a learning experience with social media and soon enough you’ll be an expert.

If you’re looking for a tool that can help automate your social media for your business I recommend checking out Hootsuite, this tool allows you to schedule your tweets or post for certain dates and times. This tool has helped my business in such a way that I can never repay, all I can say is thank you Hootsuite. You have saved countless hours and helped to build our brand to where it is today.

Some other tools that are recommended to check out are unfolllowers,  socialbro,  dosocial ... let me know if you have any other suggestions, leave your comment in the comments area.

So this is our 5 step guide to becoming a boss on Shopify! There is a bit more to it but read more on our blog and search the web. There are tons of tools out there to help you get up and selling on the web. Remember it's not as hard as you think and if you are serious about selling online then jump in! Don't sit on the sidelines, E-commerce is the future of sales so get in now and get started! As always feel free to email us at info@shopidd.com

ecommerce,Opinions on migration,"I recently migrated from an old oscommerce site to OpenCart.  

I did do a bunch of .htaccess redirects for my main products.  However, with over 4,000 products, I didn't even try to redirect them all.

And now I see a pretty huge traffic drop.  It has been one month, and traffic has dropped by about half.  

One question I have is I see a lot of inbound links to images, which are now 404 since the directory structure is different.  Most of these come from Google Image and Bing Image searches. Am I better off leaving those go 404 on the OpenCart site or maybe watermarking them all and copying them back over to that non-existent directory?

I did customize my 404 page with a category list, and a message to try Search.

I do see some old URL's coming into 404's still.

ecommerce,14 Proven Tactics To Optimize Your Checkout Process,"For any e-commerce site today, one of the most important requirements is to make the checkout process fast, easy and secure without cutting any corners. After all, this is the part of the visit for your customer which fulfills the bottom line of running your business, to make sales and earn profits.


While many websites are very well designed, the checkout process is either so slow, glitchy or confusing. Often this prevents customers from finishing completing their purchase. To have a well-functioning e-commerce site in its complete and true sense, you must strategically optimize the checkout process.

Below are 14 proven tactics you should incorporate into your checkout process to make your site a real selling machine:

Allow Guest Checkouts

You might have heard, that allowing guest checkouts is a useful feature for new customers. Considering how ‘lazy’ internet surfers have become, rest assured, a lot of them probably may not want to register on your website. It’s not that people are lazy, they are often simply too busy and will buy your product if they don’t have to create an account.

Makes sense right? But it might not be so obvious that a guest checkout is even more useful for returning customers. Why? They often forget their password because the last time they shopped with you was a year back. What can they do in this scenario? If you don’t have a guest checkout, the only option they have is to use the password recovery – which is not something your customers do gladly. Then they have to check their email, reset their password or login with the new password, many people will simply not complete the sale.

A guest checkout is a simple solution that gives new and repeat customers an easy way to complete a purchase. Of course, you have to implement security measures in order to make sure that an unregistered guest still gets all the requisite details in his mail box, and you keep a record of the purchase.

Provide Optional “Register Later” feature

Although it is convenient for a user to not register but still make a purchase through guest checkout, your website might fare better if your customer did register. Each registered visitor is a potential long-term customer for an e-commerce site. A registered user receives constant updates about various offers and promotional sales on your site. He or she may also remember your brand better since they made the effort to register. This is often the reason e-commerce sites don’t allow guest checkouts.

In this case, you can set up an option to register at a later stage, that is, either after making the purchase or at any stage of the checkout process. This way most new customers choosing the guest checkout option will still be registered users in the end.


Don’t Force Registration, Provide an Incentive

How do you convince ‘lazy’ Internet surfers to register? People are busy these days, you’ve got to convince that registration is worth their time. Provide an incentive. List out all the benefits arising out of being a registered user as compared to not being one. Sell it somewhat like file sharing websites sell their paid accounts. They use a unique method of also mentioning the disadvantages of not being a registered user so as to persuade the visitors more. You can also use promotional offers to persuade people to register.

“Sell” the registration like AdditionElle.com does:


Provide an Optional Social Login

The few passwords that people remember are their social networking passwords. It is no news that most people on the Internet use social networking websites extensively and are always signed into them.

Allowing your customers to sign into your site or register through their social networking accounts is an excellent way to not only register them in an indirect manner but also to increase their ease of use. They save themselves the effort to fill in long forms, and you still have a registered user.


Use a Vertical “Fake” Single-Page Checkout Process

The spread of mobile devices made a big change in online user behavior – people are much more willing to scroll up and down than they were before. And they prefer checkout processes that require a minimal change of pages to get anything done.

Unfortunately, e-commerce websites usually have a multi-page checkout process where each step starting from login or registration to entering credit card details is carried out on a separate page.

An elegant and easy way to solve this problem is to have a multi-page checkout, but present it as a “fake” singe-page checkout. Have all the steps on a single page in a vertical format under various headings. This not only tells the customer which stage he or she is on but also makes it more convenient.

Keep Distraction to a Minimum

Stemming from the desire to provide lots of information and gather as much data as possible, lengthy checkout processes often make customers lose their steam and drop the purchase.

A minimal checkout, on the other hand, allows the customer to check out instantaneously and increases the chances of a sale. For example, having twenty separate fields for ten components of information, howsoever important they may be, would put a customer off.

Instead, ask only what is required and allow the customer to fill the information in broad, convenient fields.


 
Offer Non-Intrusive Help if Needed

Successfully converting a visitor to a buyer is not very easy and you must keep the customer informed throughout the process. Your e-commerce site should have embedded customer-assistance features that are available in the checkout process at each and every step.

The customers might have doubts regarding your product and instead of them having to leave the checkout to look for your contact number, make it easy for your customers and allow the option to chat, see FAQs, call your company etc. on that very checkout page.


Don’t Redirect Users When Providing Additional Information

Even if you have to provide additional information to users, don’t let them leave the checkout process – display the required information in an overlay popup. Even opening a new window for them is not something you should do.

As a part of customer assistance, many modern websites such as Abercrombie.com provide the feature of information popups at every stage. For instance, the amount for shipping or the countries where you ship can be shown as a popup when the customer reaches for the option to fill in his shipping address.


The Content of the Cart Should Be Always Visible

A customer, especially one who shops for products in bulk will often forget which products they have put in the cart. Sometimes customers forget the specifications of the products that they have chosen.

Instead of them having to go to a separate cart page, making the cart contents visible alongside the checkout process serves well in keeping the potential customer engaged and on track.

Gymboree.com’s checkout process is a good example – they display not only the contents but brief information about the products as well:

Gymboree.com

Show Shipping and Handling Prices As Soon As Possible

Nothing puts a customer off more than the feeling of being cheated. Usually, websites which add taxes, shipping charges and other charges such as packaging and handling make the total cost visible at the end of the check-out process which creates a feeling of shock for the customer. Instead, you should make the total cost visible as soon as possible in order to appear transparent and trustworthy to the customer. Look at Footlocker.com’s check-out process for a good example of the same.


Always Provide an Order Review/Summary

Instead coming off as one of those sneaky websites, make sure that the potential customers get to review their order before clicking on the payment button. This ensures that the customers know what they are buying and if so wish to change their order, they can with ease.

The lack of this may cause confusion in the minds of potential customers. Ideally, right before the final payment button, there should be a summary of all the essential details regarding the product and pricing.

While most websites sport this feature, check out Baymard.com for a great example:

Upsell Carefully and Relevantly

Checkout can be a great time to upsell something to your customers. Customers are usually excited at the point of checkout and you can use this euphoria to convince them to buy more. Add to this a smart discount and you might have the customer buying more things than initially planned.

Also, you can use this time to build rapport with your customers and promote any free or really cheap products that your website is currently offering. Remember, the more polite and customer-friendly the checkout process, the higher the chances of conversion and returning customers.

But be careful, the main goal of the checkout process is to finalize the sale – don’t overdo upselling, or you’ll lose customers needlessly.

Provide Gift Wrapping or Other Special Add-ons

A great way to impress your customers is to allow for a gift wrapping option at the end of their purchase. A lot of people are buying things for others and the option to wrap the product or add a special message or anything else that you might find viable to offer to the customer can go a great way in incentivizing the purchase for them.

However, be cautioned that people generally are apprehensive about gift wrapping since large websites have been known to wrap products terribly, so make sure you can deliver what you promise. This can also be a great way to earn some extra bucks.


Use Exit-Intent Popups to Decrease Cart Abandonment

Exit-intent popups like OptiMonk can be your saving grace during the checkout process. If a visitor is leaving the checkout process without completing their purchase, you can make a popup appear which either prompts them that they are leaving or provides them an incentive to complete the purchase.

Also, if your visitor has decided to leave your website, there’s nothing to lose, and you can at least get an email address of this potential customer. You can also provide an incentive to capture their email address such as a discount on their next purchase or some other offer.

Summary

This is a general compilation of tips which should work for 99% of ecommerce websites. You should check all of these tips against the nature of your website, if any of these won’t work for one reason or another, don’t use it.

Also, it’s important that you strategize your checkout process to make it suits your website’s nature more generally. Depending on what you are selling, a certain shopping cart design or payment process or offer may be relevant to your customers or it may put them off.

The bottom line is to increase sales for your ecommerce website, make sure you spend time improving your checkout process.

ecommerce,Advice from someone who has run an e-Commerce store for 4 years,"Hi guys, I never really post in this subreddit but I decided I wanted to share what I have learnt so the community can learn as well.

**Disclaimer:** I am not some guru, I'm just a dude who has been doing this for sometime. I haven't been very successful overall but I have had my moments. Also the advice below doesn't apply to all products and stores, there are definitely exceptions.

**A bit about my store**

Firstly a bit about my site. 4 years ago my brother started an online LED lighting store. I intially worked for him handling all the packing of orders. Over time I started handling the emails and calls and eventually began running the entire store myself. We have seen moderate success over the years. Since opening, we have sold a total of $715k worth of product. Last year we only sold $130k so as you can see business ain't exactly getting better. That said I have learnt a lot and have plenty to share so here goes.

**Choosing the right product**

This is so damn important! Let me tell you LED's are a shit product to sell. They require lots of explanation and the market is very price competitive. 

1. Choose something easy to ship
2. Try to avoid products that require lots of certifications
3. Don't try enter very competitive markets unless you have some amazing strategy
4. Avoid products which consumers are very price sensitive on. Competing on price sucks!
5. Always keep your eye open for niche markets
6. Try pick products that you have lots of knowledge about

**Generating Traffic &amp; Sales**

1. Build good SEO, write plenty of useful articles. 70% of our website traffic comes from a few key articles that have hit the SEO bulls eye over the years.
2. Be analytic, see where most of your traffic is coming from, try to see the patterns, then replicate what works
3. Focus on increasing conversion rate. If for example you have a 0.5% conversion rate and you have 200 people coming to your site, the way to make double the money you currently are is either by doubling traffic or the conversion rate. Sometimes its far easier to increase your conversion rate than generate more traffic.
4. Don't just waste money on paid marketing, always test and make sure you are able to measure your returns.
5. Look at pages that bring in high traffic but also have a high bounce rate. These pages are optimization gold mines, figure out how to reduce the bounce rate and get people moving through your site rather than leaving

**Managing Orders &amp; Customers**

1. Always be 100% honest and up front with customers.
2. Use evernote or wunderlist to track orders, customer inquires, items that need to be ordered etc, it makes life much easier when many orders come in. Take a look at Zapier to automate pushing orders from your ecommerce platform to other systems.
3. Do not go crazy and order stock, try to only order exactly whats required. I often don't even have stock of most products. Most customers are happy to wait 5-7 days for their order to get dispatched. Knowing this, I rarely have huge amounts of money sitting in stock. I only order products when need it and get it within a week.

Thats it for now guys, I am happy to answer some specific questions you have, I won't be on reddit constantly but Ill be around. Also check out our site and give us some feedback if you like www.led-depot.com.au . Hopefully you learnt a few things from my experience of running an online store.

PS. excuse any spelling mistakes or errors, I was sorta typing this in a hurry.

ecommerce,Are there any good shared review databases I could switch my site to? (So I can display ratings based on many reviews rather than few or none. ),"On my e-commerce site, many of our products have very few reviews, if any.

ecommerce,Integrating Magento site with In-Store POS and Amazon?,"We're selling through 3 channels: Magento, walk-in customers, and Amazon. 2 years in business, we have approx 400 SKUs, large warehouse, and growing rapidly.

We're at the point now where we need to do a much better job of keeping track of where sales are occurring, sell-through rate, inventory management, and automated accounting. I'm trying to take the business from spreadsheets to the modern age, and figuring out what systems to use is a pain in the ass. Any advice?

Right now I've looked at a number of solutions and there is nothing that's really ""all-in-one"" that works. It's all a hodgepodge of stuff.

What I've considered:

1) Stitchlabs and Brightpearl for inventory management and recording COGS. Stitch has a half-baked magento integration unfortunately (doesn't work with many product types such as Grouped and Bundles), and Brightpearl costs a small fortune to get started.

2) Considering getting P&amp;L statement integration for Magento along with entering a ""cost"" attribute for each product, and using that to figure out profit/loss on sales through the site and in-store sales. Then using Inventory Lab for Amazon side of things.

3) Will probably have to use manual adjustments to stock quantity for Amazon side because if/when we run low on stock, we'd rather stop selling on Amazon before our own site.

4) IWD POS for our POS seems reasonable and looks like it would work well with separating out our in-store sales which are currently just entered into Magento without any way to tell whether the sales was made online or in-store unless you look at the order notes.

5) I need to find something that creates nice reports from Magento data such as sell-through rate on per-product basis. Right now we're guesstimating how much inventory to order and only Amazon has the system in place for us to know exactly what we need there.

6) Thinking of using Xero for accounting. Probably needs more extensions/integrations to work with our systems.

Basically it's a huge amount of work and it would be great if anyone has any suggestions and/or knows of companies that handle this kind of stuff.",7,5,2015-03-24,ECOM,0.06061795353889465,0.9142554402351379,0.025126630440354347

Örneğin; Web sitenizde saat satmak istiyorsunuz ve ortalama bu kategori 5.000 adet üründen oluşuyor. Sadece bir kategori için ürünlerin görsellerini, fiyatlarını, açıklamalarını tek tek manuel olarak yüklemeye çalışmanız haftalar hatta aylar sürecek bir çalışma yapmanıza neden olmaktadır. Oysa ki xml entegrasyonu kullanarak tedarikçiniz'in sitesinde bulunan ürünlerin tamamını ortalama 1-2 saat içerisinde sitenize aktarabilirsiniz. Ayrıca tedarikçi tarafından bu ürünlerin güncellenmesi, stok veya fiyatlarında yapılacak değişiklikler xml sayesinde sizin sitenizde de güncellenecek'tir. Tedarikçinin stokta kalmayan ürünleri silmesi veya inaktif hale getirmesi, aynı şekilde yeni ürün eklemesi veya stokta olmayan ürünün tekrar stoklara gelmesi de yapılan güncellemeler ile sizin e-ticaret sitenize de yansıyacaktır. Bu bahsettiğimiz konular [e-ticaret sitelerinde xml kullanımının avantajları](http://www.gokhansezer.com/e-ticaret-sitelerinde-xml-kullaniminin-avantajlari-ve-dezavantajlari) olarak sayılabilir.

E-ticaret sitelerinde xml kullanımının en büyük dezavantajı ise bir tedarikçinin birçok e-ticaret projesine xml entegrasyonu ile ürün sağlaması ve aynı ürünlerin aynı resimler ve aynı açıklamalar ile onlarca siteye aktarılmasıdır. Bu durumda bütün sitelerin birbirinin aynı olması ve kopya içerik ile karşı karşıya kalınması anlamına gelmektedir. Kopya içerik de arama  motorları tarafından hoş karşılanmayan bir durumdur.

Bu durumu aşmak için ürünlerin açıklamalarında ve resimlerinde ekleme veya düzeltme yapmanız gerekmektedir. Ayrıca ürünlerin yorum kısmını müşterilerinize aktif olarak kullanmasını sağlayabilirseniz eğer özgün içerikler üretmiş olacak ve arama motorlarının gözünde pozitif yönde puan almış olacaksınız.

E-ticaret siteleri için en önemli seo kaynağı müşteri yorumlarıdır. Bu nedenle birçok firma müşterilerine puan veya ödül sistemi getirerek onların ürün hakkında yorum yapmasını istemektedir. E-ticaret sitelerinde özgün içerik sağlamanın en önemli yolu farklı kullanıcılar tarafından yapılan yorumlardır.",0,1,2015-03-24,ECOM,0.11334394663572311,0.8485731780529022,0.03808282129466534

ecommerce,Finding and committing to a niche,"I'm in the process of finding a niche market.  So far I've found a niche product that is currently sold in 3-4 brand name stores online.  These stores also sell many related products under the whole umbrella market but there is no store only selling this product.  These stores also don't advertise this niche heavily as they have much bigger niches that they focus on. 

The niche is a group of products and accessories.  They are new to the market (past 5 years) and my store would focus on providing information on how to use the product along with starter kits.  This is currently not offered at the brand name ecommerce stores.  The product is definitely something that a first time user would want information on how to use correctly.
________
Using an analogy, say three big name coffee stores sell coffee and accessories including a new type of coffee machine (in which there are a few different brands).  But there is no store that only focuses these new types of machines.  My store would sell the new machines and all related accessories.   

From my market research, lots of people enjoy the coffee from these new machine but as far as they know they must go to a coffee shop for this experience.   Many don't know that they could purchase the machines for home use for a reasonable price.
_____________
These are the main points that are intriguing me.  Google research shows there is definitely enough interest for this product.

Things that are worrying me are:

-I have found a distributor for some of the products.  However, 1 manufacturer does not look like they distribute their products and sell exclusively from their store.  So my store would not include these.

-If a customer orders products that I need to source from different distributors, how can I have them sent in one package? Or do you send them in different packages like Amazon.



Does it sounds like I'm going down the right path?  Any red flags I should look out for?

ecommerce,"Should I Make a ""Tool Kit"" for Social Media Blogger Marketing?","Hey all, I've been thinking, stewing on this for a while and a bit hesitant before doing it and wanted to get some feedback. 

Would you or any other e-commerce store owners value having a DIY ""tool kit"" for social media blogger marketing? Like practical tactics, templates, data-analytics tracker, etc. Just throwing ideas out.

Thoughts? And if you think it'd be valuable, what tools/tactics/services would you want to see in this 'kit'?

I have domain experience in running our own e-commerce brand and collaborating with influencers big and small like Michelle Phan (7m Youtube subscribers) and already set up other e-commerce owners with successful campaigns on Instagram to get them real ROI, no fluff.

Now since I don't want the products shown on this splash page I installed a plugin called, ""WooCommerce Hide Shop Products"" by codewoogeek. This plugin works but there is a error message, ""No products were found matching your selection."" that I cant find a way to remove.

Does anybody here know how to remove this message? Is there another way that I'm able to achieve all this without installing plugins and changing code?

ecommerce,How is the E-Commerce industry growing and what to expect.,"E-Commerce Industry: India and Global

Increased internet penetration has led to a very exciting period for e-commerce. It is the period in which we can safely predict a better growth pattern for the future based on the accomplishments of our glorious past. Not only that, we can also relish in the safety of our future growth due to the huge consumer potential countries like India have. It is this belief that is fuelling the growth of the e-commerce portals, along with the millions in investments being poured in. The B2C e-commerce industry generated around $400 billion, worldwide in the year 2010 which leads to an estimation of $700-$950 Billion in the year 2015. With $1.7 Trillion in sales generated in 2014 increasing almost 20%, the data seems consistent with our predictions.

With the current increase in Internet penetrations in India, the number of Internet subscribers will exceed 3 million this year, if it hasn’t already and add to that the constant efforts of agencies like the Indian govt and Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerburg’s initiative intenet.org, we can safely estimate a sudden spike in the total number of internet subscribers. Even though portals like Amazon and Flipkart are not generating profits, revenues from B2C e-commerce are expected to rise by 10% in established markets such as UK and France and around 3% in less established B2C e-commerce markets.

ecommerce,E-Ticaret Danışmanı Kimdir?,"[**E-Ticaret Danışmanı**](http://www.gokhansezer.com) sektör konusunda bilgi ve tecrübe sahibi olan ve bu bilgisini danışmanlık boyutuna taşıyabilen kişidir. E-ticaret hakkında kulaktan dolma bilgilere sahip kişiler bile günümüzde kendini e-ticaret danışmanı olarak adlandırmaktadır.

[**E-Ticaret Danışmanlığı**](http://www.gokhansezer.com) yapmak için öncelikle e-ticaret yapmış ve sektörün havasını solumuş olmak en önemli kriter olmalı diye düşünüyorum. Çünkü müşterilerle diyalog halinde olmak onların ne istediğini, neye ihtiyacı olduğunu bilmek bu işi daha doğru yapmak adına önemli bir konudur. ikinci olarak bir e-ticaret sitesini yönetmek, kargo takibi, ürün girişi, kategorilendirme, müşteri hizmetleri gibi uygulamaları bilmek ve kullanmak e-ticaret danışmanı için önemli ayrıntılardır. 

Sadece kod bilgisi veya seo bilmek e-ticaret danışmanlığı için yeterli değildir. İyi bir e-ticaret danışmanı için seo bilgisi mutlaka gereklidir fakat önemli olan nokta her sitenin seo çalışmasının aynı olmadığı, özellikle e-ticaret siteleri için seo çalışmasının ayrı bir kategoride değerlendirilmesi gerektiğidir. Bu sebeple e-ticaret danışmanı aynı zamanda bilgisiyle seo danışmanı olarak ta yanınızda olmalıdır. 

E-ticaret projesinin tanıtımı en önemli konulardan biridir. Bu noktada devreye İnternet reklamcılığı ve sosyal medya yönetimi girmektedir. Reklam konusuna hakim olabilmek için sosyal medyaya hakim olmak gerekir. Sosyal medya demek sadece facebook ve twitter demek değildir. Sosyal medya birçok tanıtım ve paylaşım kanalını bünyesinde barındıran oldukça geniş bir mecradır. Bu platformu tam anlamıyla kullanan bir sosyal medya danışmanı size özellikle tanıtım maliyetleri açısından büyük avantaj sağlayacaktır.

Son olarak iyi bir e-ticaret danışmanı aynı zamanda [**sosyal medya danışmanı**](http://www.gokhansezer.com) ve [**seo danışmanı**](http://www.gokhansezer.com) olarak bütün halinde hizmet vermelidir.",0,1,2015-03-28,ECOM,0.06724660843610764,0.8886634111404419,0.04408998787403107

I've been pondering with starting an online store for years. Idea of running it, marketing it always seemed appealing, I even have some web dev/design skills even though on a very little level now.

What I had always struggled with was finding a distributor for my products.

My most recent idea was to resell perfumes/fragrances, maybe not a good idea, but it's a product that you need to buy more often than let's say a CPU (even though I'd love to have online store with some techy stuff)

So how do i find a distributor for let's say a lacoste perfume or any other product for that matter. (Obviously I want original products, not fake, which seems to be popular among many online stores in my country)

All your answers shall be appreciated a lot! :)",5,8,2015-03-30,ECOM,0.0216197706758976,0.9070014357566833,0.07137874513864517

woocommerce,Where to put code for modifying shipping costs?,"I'm building a store for someone that wants to simply charge $1.50 for each additional item above the first. After searching around, I found people with other shipping cost problems and adapted some other code into something I think will work:

	function woocommerce_custom_surcharge(){ 
		global $woocommerce;
		//Getting Cart Contents. 
		$cart = $woocommerce-&gt;cart-&gt;get_cart();
		//Calculating Quantity
		foreach($cart as $cart_val =&gt; $cid){
			$qty += $cid['quantity']; 
		}
		//Your Condition
		if($qty&gt;1)
		{
			$excost = ($qty - 1) * 1.5;
		}
				
		$woocommerce-&gt;cart-&gt;add_fee('Charges delivery', $excost, $taxable = false, $tax_class = '');
	}    
However, I'm not sure what to do with the code now that I have it. Where should I put the code and what do I need to do to utilize it?

woocommerce,Filtering system for large product database,"Hi everyone, we have a woocommerce website aimed at general trawling and finding cool products so we will have a very large database of items.

I want to implement some sort of filtering system for the customer to input a few of their interests to narrow down the crap.

It doesn't need to be specific (as in narrowing down to gold watches only) but i need some sort of filtering system that lets me:

1) Have 3 - 4 different custom points to filter.

2) I need to be able to rename both the name of the filter and the options (e.g. change categories to Do you like puppies? and my category as Yes or No so on and so-forth).

3) If at all possible, if i select option A in selector 1, selector 2 now shows a different set of results than it would have if i selected option B.

4) Cannot use a sidebar, some sort of menu bar above my woocommerce loop would be ideal.

Ive been looking around alot today and the closest option i found is WooCommerce Grid : Display Product + AJAX Filter http://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-grid-display-product-ajax-filter/9936306

Ive also looked at FacetWP  https://facetwp.com/

But Neither seem to be able to customize the search functions the way i need. I'd really appreciate if anyone knew of a plugin that could replicate this otherwise i may need to turn to hiring someone to create something custom for us.
