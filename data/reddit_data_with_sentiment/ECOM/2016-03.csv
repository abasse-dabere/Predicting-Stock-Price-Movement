ecommerce,"Just launched! My first foray into e-commerce, sourcing products and marketing. Any feedback would be hugely appreciated!","Hello there. Herein lies my very first ecommerce adventure for you to tear to shreds. Site: https://avantgarden.com.au

It started when I randomly found a video about dropshipping + Amazon on YouTube. It made it sound so easy and efficient to the point where I signed up for Salehoo etc only to realise the viability was much less than made out to be. From there I decided maybe I would try FBA instead (from Australia so FBM was not an option). All the videos made it also sound very easy and like free money! Alas, after a miscalculation by a certain plugin by a factor of 10x and a few hundred dollars wasted on sourcing samples of 'niche' items that were SURE to bring me in cash I realised the margins were barely there and the competition had more capital than me.

On to my most recent endeavour: a standalone ecommerce website. At first this sounded like the most daunting option, complete with the largest set of 3-letter marketing acronyms. Wading through this and researching the many aspects and elements in my downtime, I finally decided on a niche and made a site. At first I decided I wouldn't make a blog, but the seemingly overwhelming opinion is that it will greatly help in marketing the site and driving traffic, so I've decided it's a wise investment and will be posting spiritual/self-help/feel-good/travel/nature/wellness articles, relevant to the interests of those who are likely to buy the products. 

Tonight I launched to a relatively underwhelming response, and have just started ad testing through Facebook and using a Facebook page. I know SEO has to come, along with other social media but I'm sorta lost as to what steps to take next. No sales as of yet (it's only been a few hours), so I can't very well go and make large orders from suppliers if no one is gonna buy the stuff. 

Really looking for feedback on what sucks, what doesn't, should I add more products or just bring more traffic first, and overall opinions on the niche.

Thank you in advance, kind folk of this sub.",12,7,2016-03-01,ECOM,0.03978414833545685,0.9232740998268127,0.03694170340895653

I am currently applying for placements to sandwich between my university course. I want to move into the digital marketing industry when I graduate but before that happens I need experience.

I'm looking into a solution, pretty similar to how affiliate works, but not quite. I'm therefore turning to you, if any of you dashing people know a way around! Here's what I'm trying to build:

Person A buys products for $50. After completing the purchase a code is sent, that person A can enter and see that the grand total spent with this code is $50. Person A then sends this code to B, C, D and E. They all use the same code as a coupon code. It doesn't give them any discount, but now they can see that the grand total spent with this code is $250.

At certain amounts ($100, 250, 500 etc) person A will recieve an email with instructions for new benefits. For example, after reaching $250 in ""joint spending"" person A can now enter a discount to get a freebie, a discounted product or a cheaper upgrade.

From there, people can save the tutorial, however, if you close out of it early, you'll use on of your potential 2 downloads. 

Is there an easy way to have a larger upload limit? 64Mb is too small. In addition, I tried creating a php.ini file and a php5.ini file in the File Manager of cPanel, but that didn't work either.

ecommerce,1000+ Visitors In My Site's First Month == 0 Sales. What am I doing wrong?,"Hi there-

I'm Colby and I just launched arrayprints.com about a month ago. I've been looking to get my own business going for a while, so I took a few design ideas I had while reading a programming forum and launched a store with Shopify. I'm admittedly very, very new to design and marketing, so I suspect I'm making tons of mistakes here, and I'd appreciate any feedback.

After launching, I ran several Facebook ad campaigns for Website clicks, with some campaigns pointing directly at my home page, one pointing at the collections page, and several pointing directly at a specific product page. Each one was fairly successful in getting people to the site, about $0.15 per click, although almost all my results came from Audience Network, the one campaign using only Facebook news feeds had a much worse response rate and I killed it.

Per some advice from another redditor, I used a mockup for the shirt in one campaign that wasn't just the standard shirt-on-white-background image from the site. It improved clickthroughs slightly, but still nobody made it to the cart.

One night I posted a link to one of shirts on r/programmerhumor, and got about 600 pageviews in the first two hours before it vanished (presumably due to being self-promotional).

Most of the Facebook traffic exited directly from page it pointed to, as did the Reddit visitors (although they did poke around a bit more). Only 4 people ever made it to the shopping cart. 

I have some faith that the shirt ideas have potential, given how many people have clicked through. Is that an incorrect assumption? I realize there are a LOT of t shirt shops out there these days, but it would be nice to have sold at least a couple shirts at this point out of 1100 people.

Currently, since I can't keep burning cash on Facebook ads I've turned to trying to market on Instagram @arrayprintsandapparel.  Again, some decent responses from people, but it has yet to convert to much traffic, much less a conversion.  One other IG account reposted me the first night and got about 600 likes on the photo, and I think that got one person to the shopping cart.  

Where am I going wrong?  Is my product page copy the culprit? I admittedly mostly use the boilerplate stuff from Shopify there.

Thanks for reading all this,

Colby.",30,4,2016-03-07,ECOM,0.11485899239778519,0.8621067404747009,0.02303425967693329

ecommerce,My store uses Google Trusted Stores. Its scores in GTS and BizRate are great. ResellerRatings score is abysmal. Can I do anything about that?,"Here are my scores:

* GTS: 4.7/5 - 1500+ reviews
* BizRate: over 4.5/5 - 60+ reviews (can't get an exact number)
* ResellerRatings: 0.5/5 - 22 reviews

My guess is that RR only gets reviews from people who are angry enough to track down their web site, and these reviews are going all the way back to 2009, so ~3 negatives per year is pretty damn good!

Naturally, GTS is finding the average between all 3 rating systems, so our overall score is still very good. The number of ratings in GTS and BR greatly outweigh those in RR.

However, this is basically what customers are seeing if they click through the GTS button:

* Overall: Great
* GTS: Great
* BR: Great
* RR: Horrible! Don't buy here!

Can I do anything about RR? Maybe get it removed from my GTS page? I certainly don't want to remove bad reviews, but I also don't want a site that only attracts *bad* reviews playing such a prominent role on my GTS summary page.

Actually, I wouldn't mind getting rid of BR too. Their web site is pretty broken.

* Small e - commerce site (7000 unique over the last 90 days) 

* All e-commerce SEO advice claims individual product reviews are important citing unique SEO content and if nothing else conversion rates. 

Has anyone experimented with having staff review products to kick things off? We have 3 staff members who are familiar with all our products and could give pretty good reviews. I'm toying with the idea of flagging the user as ""STAFF MEMBER"" and ""STAFF REVIEW"" to be completely upfront with users. 

* Would google look at this as being dishonest and in turn penalize us? 
* Has anyone got any experience with this sort of thing? 
* There are no plugins or anything out there if any devs wish to get involved 

Traditional ways of getting this done are pretty hard for us, our product is somewhat expensive and are items that users wish to try first and rarely pull the trigger online - think expensive jackets/clothes, spa pools, furniture etc.

ecommerce,Temporary alternative to a non mobile-friendly website?,"So, here's the issue:

We currently have 5 ecommerce websites up and running. Problem is, they're faaaaaaaaaaar from being mobile-friendly since they rely a on a 10 year old tech.

Our IT team estimated that it could take up to a full year to take that old tech and adjust it to be mobile friendly, which is quite sad since  we're currently working on a new platform that will be ready in 9-12 months (hopefully) and got pretty much everything set up to make it work.

I was wondering if there was any easy fix that could help us get all the sales we drop on mobile by setting up any kind of temporary page or solution like Shopify or another self-hosted solution?

ecommerce,Career Advice: Stick with CRM or move to PPC?,"So there's a new opportunity where I work for (our first) in-house PPC Analyst, where I'm currently a CRM (and a bit of CRO) executive and feel like I've learnt most of the things I can doing that. 

I've spoken to people about this role who think I would be great for the new role (they are having difficulty recruiting for it as well - most PPC bods want a more significant salary than we have on offer, whereas my current role is easy to recruit for) as it would be a new challenge and I have the right skills, but I don't have any PPC experience specifically.

The risk is, it's an untested role, as we currently have an agency manage our PPC and so this would be to find out if having someone in-house full time can add value there. The agency would remain in place. If it turns out there isn't a huge value to add there... it could be very uncomfortable for me to say the least! 

Compare that to CRM where they know I'm very capable and can carry on, and that area of the business will definitely grow, but it will end up me being a (very capable) one-trick pony.",5,2,2016-03-10,ECOM,0.020609067752957344,0.9175382256507874,0.06185263767838478

My business is solely reselling products from a variety of different distributors and my value-add is the pre-sales and post-sales support cycle.

One thing that takes up a massive amount of time however is adding products to the store. My suppliers have thousands of products and they change frequently.

Each product easily takes a couple of minutes to add and with thousands of products, including searching would take forever. Time that is better spent on engaging visitors, strategizing sales campaigns, etc.

I believe these are the best growth hacks to double your profits from existing traffic.

You can read the guide online and download a free copy at:

Last week I used the value propositions point on a Shopify client. From that one change, they improved sales 12%, which will equate to an extra $2.4 million per year. Most stores don't split-test and optimize which is such a frustrating thing to see because you can grow so easily.

If your store is new and you don't get much traffic to it, you won't benefit from the guide very much. You're better off investing in traffic though the methods are invaluable to know for when you want to leverage your initial traction.

ecommerce,Is it possible or just a enormous stretch?,"Hello fellow entreprenuers!

I've been lurking on this forum for a while with a question in mind that I haven't been able to solve myself. I'm currently on my own e-commerce venture where I'm trying to dropship a specific product from alibaba to my customers here in Sweden. 

The problem that has parlyzed me and got me stuck in my ways is the negotiating process I'm currently dealing with, regarding the delivery time and delivery cost. My aim is to give my customers a quick delivery time and a reasonable price so that i compete with my  competitors. So i negotiated down the delivery time which led to higher shipping cost.

Furhter on, my manufactures are demanding a 200USD per unit for the product that I'm trying to order and the product weighs around 3-8kg depending on which model. This high shipping cost basically kills any potential profit margin that i could basically get.

My question to you is: Would it be possible to run a business which  has a delivery time of 15 - 35 days. Also Have you had any own experiences and how did that venture fold out? If not, is there any way around this.

ecommerce,The Open Source Battle Continues: Magento vs. Solidus,"We recently wrote a blog post on Spree vs. Solidus and had a surge of email questions about open source ecommerce platforms. One question we wanted to answer: âWhatâs better, Magento or Solidus?â

The short answer (IMHO): **Solidus**.

Of course, we realize this may be a sensitive subject as the Magento dev community is notoriously faithful to their platform, so the opinion we're giving is based on our recommendation to an ecommerce company looking to make a switch and isn't 100% tied to staying on a Magento build.

Here's our answer:

Though the recent release of Magento 2 is a very important step in the platformâs progression, it feels like itâs coming a bit too late. While Magento was working on its major upgrade, other technologies (like Solidus) had already launched their solutions, acquired customers, and have started swaying ecommerce developers away from platforms like Magento. Hereâs why:

**1. User-Friendly Admin Panel**

Magento offers many options in its admin panel, which makes the backend cluttered and overwhelming. An unnecessarily cluttered admin panel can often complicate what should be easy-to-accomplish functions. Users navigating through the admin panel will have many tabs and sub-navigations (or secondary menus). Depending on the user, this can get confusing, become frustrating and end up taking much more time than it should. However, with the release of Magento 2, thereâs been a major upgrade to the admin interface design, so this could be less of an issue for stores on version 2.

The admin panel of Solidus is built around simplicity. Solidus is much less cluttered compared to Magento, making it more organized. It also minimizes the options offered in its flat navigation (what Magento 2 panel looks like now). Solidusâ minimal backend UI is purposeful and keeps the admin interface streamlined and focused. Having this cleaner admin panel makes it much easier for users to navigate and accomplish tasks.

**2. Lines of Code**

The main difference in efficiency between Magento and Solidus lies within the difference in code. Magento has over 8.2 million lines of code, whereas Solidus uses approximately 45k.

Why such a huge difference?

Remember, Magento provides more functions as core functions. Solidus, by default, comes as a lightweight storefront. The extensions for Solidus have to be installed and can increase functionality.

The difference in size of the core of both Magento and Solidus makes a difference in many things, but most the obvious is page load time. 

**3. Speed of Development**

Lastly, Solidus is quicker to build with. Itâs true that Ruby on Rails (the language Solidus is written in) is not as common as PHP (the language of Magento). But, Ruby has become renowned as one of the most productive frameworks because it requires less coding to achieve the same functionality â meaning Ruby needs less code to accomplish the same function as PHP (Magento). This affects the overall amount of code (see above), and keeps your store running smoothly and efficiently.

Of course, for ecommerce companies that have an existing Magento build, we would need to do a thorough assessment of their current code and business goals, then assess what platform we would recommend for their development project and if it makes sense to migrate away from Magento.

However, if they need to begin an ecommerce website project from scratch, weâd recommend Solidus over Magento because itâs friendlier to develop with, has much less code, has better admin panel usability for the storeâs manager/owner and the development time will be exponentially less.

woocommerce,Shipping Class Costs,"I am wondering if there is a way to group a few shipping classes into a single flat rate, yet leave one certain shipping class be counted at a separate rate per item for items that go Canada since the shipping expense for shipping larger items to Canada is exorbitant.

A customer orders (3) items from Shipping Class X, (2) items from Shipping Class Y, (5) items from Shipping Class A, and (4) items from Shipping Class Z. When those items are in the cart, the items from Shipping Class(es) X, Y, and Z will group into a flat rate of $9.99 while the items from Shipping Class A are individually charged $19.99 per line item since they are larger, bulkier items than the rest of my store.

ecommerce,What are your thoughts on forced account creation before completing checkout?,"It sounds horrible the way I put it, but how big of a deterrent is it really? I run [ComfortableClub.com](https://comfortableclub.com) and i'm working on the account creation work-flow. To do so, i'm designing an easy 1-click Social Media (Facebook, primarily) login and account creation option, or the more traditional e-mail and password.

I feel E-commerce store owners are afraid of 'inconveniencing' their customers. Take e-mail lists as an example. Some store owners i've talked to say they don't want to 'bother' them. I say: e-mail them until they buy, and if they don't want to or never will, allow them to easily unsubscribe. E-mails once a week should do well.

In regards to account creation, this will form part of the brand, creating a sense of belonging with the club, and will also be used for the new ""Monthly Undies"" subscription model i'm building. I've had great success with recurring orders from existing customers, but i'm afraid that new customers might be road-blocked by a 2-second form.

ecommerce,How do you manage a 9-5 and a Online Business?,"I currently work a 9-5 (really a 7-5, M-F) and I'm a fairly critical part of the company and my position does not allow me to take as much time off. Recently, I have had some moments, my staff problems, budget cuts, my salary, etc., where I have wanted to walk out, but I pushed through and always have those thoughts in my head. 

I found a product that is close to my personal hobby (note: I have networked well and have many connections in this space), and I became a dropshipper, it's a niche item and I had to bring it to market fast, it took me three weekends to build a site, and I launched on Monday. 

My background is in Marketing/E-Commerce, so I immediately went to work on promoting the company and it's been consistently growing, however, during the week, I got a number of emails and messages that I answered as fast as possible. I have only made one sale. 

I'm afraid of what is to come, I am more than willing to leave my job, but I need to see the dollars roll in. What's the best way to manage it. Currently, I'm getting home and working till 10-11PM on weekdays and all day on the weekends making changes.

ecommerce,"Need advice - Ran successful e-commerce business last year, quit, then started my own web store.","Earlier this year I quit my job as an online sales manager for a successful eyewear store. I started 3 years ago and grew the e-commerce sales to over 2000%. In order to drive traffic I used basic SEO techniques along with PPC campaigns through Google Adwords.

I have since started my own ecommerce store hoping to replicate the success I had. Although I currently offer only 1 eyewear brand (compared to 13+ at my previous job), it was a brand that I sold about $20,000 of in 2015.

I now offer the same products from this brand but have had no sales and no phone or email inquires for almost 2 months. Iâm using the same SEO techniques I used before and am starting to rank higher and higher every week (even ranking higher than my previous employer for certain products).  Additionally, I am using Google Adwords to help steer my customers away from my competitorâs websites and hopefully purchase from me. My previous employer does not use Google Adwords anymore.

In a sense I am fighting against myself because my main competitor is my previous employer. Everything that I set-up for them is now what I have to overcome. The main advantage I have is that my websites layout looks better and is much easier to navigate.

I need help figuring out ways to steal some of those sales. I tried building an advantage by working on ranking higher and using PPC but it doesn't seem to be working.

ecommerce,Help me evaluate my idea for reporting tool,"Hello /r/ecommerce

I'm a software developer with idea for a tool that might be useful for ecommerce owners. Since I've never run webstore myself I wanted to ask you about your opinion first. It's quite possible the idea is crap and there's no need for such tool. I've actually built a product in the past that nobody wanted, and I'd like to avoid making this mistake again.


**Idea**

The idea is simple, nothing new or revolutionary. I want to build a module that will allow you to create custom lists displaying any data you might need for your day-to-day operations. Imagine (simplified) excel integrated into your back-office. These lists would be quite flexible:

* you could display data from multiple records - for example list displaying fields from invoices, customer and stock
* filtering - what data should be displayed in the list
* list could have formulas - (Customer Credit Limit - Invoice Amount), (Sales Order Amount / AVERAGE(Sales Order Amount))
* conditional highlighting - custom formating - if invoice status is Paid, display row as green
* drilldowns to records - open invoice directly from link in list
* inline editing where possible - quickly change data, such as product name, from within the list
* mass updates - set field value for all rows currently displayed in the list
* exports to csv/xml
* display lists as a graphs
* list publishing - you could make list accessible from outside of back-office using url. You could publish it in different formats - interactive list, csv, xml. This feature could be used to create customized feeds for you partners.

Lists could be displayed on **custom dashboards** in various formats:

* sublist - display top X rows from list (list ordering is important)
* graph 
* KPI - reduce the list into single number


**List examples**

* list of products showing sales in last 30, 60, 90 days, current stock and some formula to calculate expected out-of-stock date
* list of customer emails with average sales order amount &gt; 3 * sales order average
* list of unreplied support messages with basic information about customer - total sales, link to last sales order, ordered by combination of date + customer rank
* list with unfulfilled Pick and Pack orders assigned either to Me or Nobody. List contains button to either grab unassigned orders, or change it's status to fulfilled.

woocommerce,angry with products with multiple variations or optional features,Just wanted to make a quick post to shine some light on the fact that woocommerce handles products with mutliple variations HORRIBLY and does not allow you to establish a products base price then add variable options to the base price without a third party plugin.

ecommerce,[SITE REVIEW] Lingerie e-commerce shop,"Hey Everyone -

I've been running my lingerie site, [Foxy Lingerie](https://www.foxylingerie.com), for a bit over a year now.  We've done a pretty healthy number of orders (over 580 now) since January 2015.   When we're in our ""busy season"" from October through Valentine's Day we can pull well above a 1% conversion rate, and even have some days in the 3% to 4% range.  However, our bounce rate is pretty high from my perspective at about 50% for the year.  Given that we get an average between 200-300 visits a day, I want to maximize as many of those as possible for sales.  With all that said, I'd love for the experts here to take a look at the site and offer any suggestions that might help me out.  Our unique selling prop is we offer free standard shipping on every offer.  As far as I know that's very unique to our space (most shops offer free shipping if you spend enough).  From a marketing perspective, I've been doing SEO on my own optimizing pages, writing content, and reaching out to influencers when I can.  I also have a PPC campaign going that just does PLA's on AdWords (that seems hit or miss over the course of the year).  Anyway, any bit of help, suggestions, or guidance you guys can offer would be super appreciated.  Thanks in advance!",13,2,2016-03-25,ECOM,0.017176274210214615,0.8474680185317993,0.13535568118095398
shopify,Sending Shopify orders to a warehouse (orderlogix) FTP via API?,"I need an API that will talk/make the link between Shopify store(s) and a warehouse where the orders are being shipped from (their system is OrderLogix).

From the first meeting with my potential client what i understand is the following: the shopify store (there might be more than one, eventually up to 10+ stores) will take orders, charge the customers and take their payments. Once the order is paid/confirmed, the application need to take the orders' data from the shopify API and re-arrange/parse/encode them to the OrderLogix requirements and upload them to the warehouse secure FTP every x hour.

There seems to be a lot of grey zones tho. Again, from what I understand, OrderLogix doesn't talk back to the program, it doesn't send a confirmation or error messages. (I may be wrong). 

Someone I talked to said it would require to have the program running on a 24/7 workstation, and that it would cost me around +8,000$CAD...

I am totally a virgin in that particular field (APIs) so i have no idea how much a programmer would charge me (is it really around 10k$CAD?) for a working solution, and where to find a qualified programmer? Is freelancer.com somehow recommended? Or is there somewhere else where I could post my project?

ecommerce,How do new store owners have so many different products? Inventory is expensive.,"Are people simply buying 5-10 units of a bunch of different products? Are they dropshipping? Something else?

Problem I see is if you want to sell your own brand of products for the purpose of differentiation, you need to make a fairly large order to even find a manufacturer. If you sell 10 products with an average MOQ of 250 units, that's a big investment up front. But if you sell only 1-2 products you may look less credible and lose appeal. And if you don't sell your own brand of products, there are a lot of other people already selling the same shit and it's tough for you to develop brand equity outside of offering better content and customer service.

Would you (as a developer) write an ecommerce api which allows other developers to build their ecommerce website without worrying about any of the server side implementation.

- login

- Reset username password

- Create, read, update, delete Customers/Users/Shops/Products/Carts

- Multilingual

- Content management system
- Image management system
- Checkout
- Payment processing via other APIs (like stripe)
- Flash sales
- Recommendation system
- Heavy analytics to help Users understand how their store is performing and understanding user behaviour.

ecommerce,"Let's make a community created E-commerce checklist (SEO,CRO,speed) - At a minimum, I'm contributing so please enjoy :)","Hey all, I'd love to make a checklist with y'all that contains every item we can collectively think of that you should check when making a new ecommerce site. Anything relating to speed, SEO, or conversions that you believe should be in place in the MVP of a site.


Here's my initial off the head list:
0.) **Don't follow anyone's advice! Test for yourself**  Ye I know, I'm about to give you an entire checklist worth of advice and there's some items like ""Gzip your files"" that you should follow because it's a standard web development piece that has no negatives... But when it comes to 'marketing' items (SEO, CRO, email, social, etc) don't assume I or anyone else knows everything but more importantly don't assume I know your business and that my advice 100% applies to you.  If you read something you 'believe' in... figure a way to test it for yourself and see how your site/company reacts to the alteration. Reverse what you've done if it's not for you and continue expanding upon what you've learned + continue expanding the method if it's being beneficial. **No 2 businesses are the same, it's your job to know what's right for yours and prioritizing those things**

1.) Gzip (server side) - Not valid for every platform/site but when possible you should make sure your files are compressed properly. Check out who you're getting your servers from too and make sure they support this.

2.) Have lead capture - It doesn't have to be fancy, or expensive, but establish some way to capture people who don't buy.

3.) Have analytics - Google is great addition to platform analytics. When it comes to google(or any analytics), establish goals and ecommerce tracking. Always have at least some kind of analytics running at some level even if you don't understand all of it it... the historical data will help consultants/marketing firms or buyers.

4.) Choose proper image files &amp; optimize them accordingly.  Make sure that images are png and jpg accordingly. png is for images meant to have transparency instead of white(or color) backgrounds &amp; images that are illustrations (lines/patterns/digitally manufactured images).  jpegs (or jpgs) are for photographs and these especially have optimization standards. When finalizing these photographs in photoshop (or you can use a image optimizer online) set these images to being optimized. In photoshop you do this by hitting ""save for web"". I typically suggest you save them at a quality level of 80% since I've never noticeably been able to spot the difference but this is completely up to you.

5.) Image titles (SEO tip): When you save an image - put a relevant title on it. Especially if your CRM/platform doesn't magically change the image name to something insane. As a result you'll increase the ranking potential for that image and also add additional context/relevance to the page the image is on. I used to mass edit original images' file names as well and put the brand name at the end so that anyone that saved the image would have a reminder on their computer of the brand... or the brand would be mentioned if they uploaded it somewhere else... it also increased the easiness of tracking some people using the image improperly.


6.)Always establish a good title tag for your home page. In 6-7 words tell someone exactly what the site is about, what you sell, etc.  Having your main page's title be ""home"" or ""brand name Y"" and nothing else doesn't help apply context towards what your site is about.  You can do the rest of the site's titles later as this will take some time and keyword research... just at a minimum, even if you don't understand SEO, maintain a good title tag on your homepage from day 0.

Thats all for now... will continue this later (It's my birthday... going to go have fun). Please leave comments and items from your checklist so we can expand this and maybe even put it into the wiki.

ecommerce,To ship free or not to ship free. That is the question,"How's it going /r/ecommerce.  I wanted to know if anyone has experimented with offering free shipping or flat rate shipping in the higher-end gift market.

I have an eCommerce businesses where I sell high-end gift items that have a political and religious story to them  (something akin to selling high end woven goods from Tibet, and selling the story along with the products.) I like to make an emotional sale..

My products sell for between 100-400 USD, with average margins of 30-50 USD per item, and average of 1 item per sale. Since I'm drop shipping from far away, I currently add 17 USD shipping per kilo (average weight of 2.5kg per sale) that the client pays at checkout. Shipping is expensive.

I was thinking of either making shipping a flat rate. Something like 20 USD per item, when average shipping price is 40. I would absorb that 20 into the product, and increase the average price per product by 20.  I could similarly do that for a free shipping option as well.

Has anyone experimented with these options in a similar environment? Any advice?

shopify,[NEW APP] Currently in beta. Create and manage custom shortcodes.,"Hey all, I've recently released an app on the Shopify market, it's in beta mode as of now and I'd be curious to hear thoughts and feedback.

There has been no way to create custom shortcodes for your pages, articles and product details (except by hand-coding each one) so that's why I built this app where you can either use pre-built useful components, or build your own from scratch. 
I feel like this could be particularly useful for blogging, as the current Shopify blog system is very limited. Through custom shortcodes we can now create any unique functionality such as styled images with captions, signup forms, CTAs, product ads, image sliders or what-have-you.

ecommerce,Localized e-commerce with multiple payment options?,"Hi, relative newbie here. So I reside in Turkey and want to open up a ecommerce site based on selling services, the groundwork is done and we already do this by physical means but want to open up to the world of internet. The problem is most of the easy to use, ecommerce software isn't turkey compatible and I want to have Paypal, credit card, postal transfer AND bank transfer as checkout options and preferably with an ""other"" option, which is basically us handling the money face-to-face. I also see payment with phone credit all the time on Turkish sites.


I HAVE NO IDEA, how to make this work. I don't know what software makes me do such things. I know my way around tech stuff, created a few websites, and am an insanely quick learner. Just please point me towards the right direction. I'm thinking of Wordpress+Woo. I think neither weebly nor the other cool drag and drop builders are capable of what I need but I'm quite ignorant on the subject. Maybe there is something?

ecommerce,Looking for advice on my ecommerce store,"Hi,
I recently started a sports clothing store (ny.clubhousecolors.com). My designs just use colors and themes of sports teams, avoiding any licensing issues. This isn't anything new, there are plenty of companies out there that make custom clothing for their sports team using the same general idea. I just wanted to do it for my favorite teams.

I am having some trouble choosing the best way to market this now. Everything I read online advises the same few steps usually dealing with social media tactics. I'm hoping to get some more specific advice. I've tried FB ads with some clicks but no sales. Maybe it's my pricing, maybe it's the products itself, or maybe I haven't found the best way to target or design the ads.

We are trying to figure out the best way to list the items based on customer experience and SEO but are kind of stuck. I was hoping to get some opinions!

So basically we carry a popular brand of ""Car Covers"" who has 4 different styles for every car ever made, in 5 different colors. 

Would it be better to create one listing for each style like this: ""Brand Style 1 Car Cover"" Then list the make/model/year/color as variant options in the listings? 

Or would it be better to separate listings like this: ""Brand Style 1 Car Cover - 1999 Ford Explorer - Black - SKU"" for every different Year/Make/Model/Color that is available. 

Each variation has it's own sku &amp; each has it's own picture because the look differs slightly depending on the vehicle. The price also changes a little bit depending on the mat (strict MAP policy from our manufacturers).

The amount of fabric in m2 is calculated by entering the width and depth in cm, the high of the pillow is defined by the type of stuffing.

**Price stuffing = (price type of stuffing per m2) x (surface area of pillow in m2)**

The surface area can be calculated from the width and depth of the pillow

**Price of seams = (type of seam)**

A set price per type of seam, no further calculations.


When these calculations get added, you should get the total price of the pillow.
