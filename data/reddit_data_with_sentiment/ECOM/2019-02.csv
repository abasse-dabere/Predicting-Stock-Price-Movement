dropship,How I went from $0 to $17k a month dropshipping (again),"Hey guys! You may recognize me from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/91t423/how_i_went_from_0_to_25k_a_month_dropshipping/) where I outlined exactly what I did to go from $0 to $25k a month dropshipping. Eventually I got bored doing the same thing everyday and thought it would be an interesting challenge to see if I could do it all over again, so I started a brand new store in August. That store is now doing close to **$17k a month** and I want to share a month by month playbook of that journey. I'll even share some products and the niche I chose that got me there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Early August - $33.18](https://i.imgur.com/tS1Dthf.png): I knew I wanted to start a new store, and that I wanted it to be a niche store. Why? Because I find it much easier to market and brand yourself. Picking a niche was pretty simple -- I found a handful of ""winning"" products and *then* decided on a niche around those. A pair of ""shark slippers"" were actually the first ones I chose, which I still sell to this day. I picked them because they are probably hard for consumers to find locally, and because they seemed like an item people on Facebook would impulse buy. I also checked that they had relatively low competition and a decent growth rate on AliExpress. For my store, I created it with Shopify using the free debut theme which is pretty much my standard for any new store.

&amp;#x200B;

[August to September - $2,028.97:](https://i.imgur.com/ReH06S9.png) I got pretty lucky as this was mostly sales from that shark slipper. I added a few other funny looking slippers to ""fill out"" the store, but most of my attention was on the shark. Its NOT typical to find a product that works on the first try, you usually need to test a bunch. I ran a combination of Facebook ads and Google ads, but the majority of sales came from Facebook. My advertising structure was basically a small sales funnel... I made a quick product video and ran 3-4 adsets of different interests using the video. I would then retarget people who watched 75% of the video with a ""sales"" ad offering a discount on the product. If this is confusing you can watch a video explaining that more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-B2hk_HVZ0). But I immediately began seeing sales with this method. I think profit margins were fairly low at this point, probably 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

[September to October - $5,474.86:](https://i.imgur.com/g652xT1.png) This was literally just me scaling the Facebook ad mentioned previously. I also began adding funny ""costume"" products to the store that matched the funny slippers theme. Profit margins were at 15% I believe. I was also busy coding up new features for Niche Scraper so I couldn't dedicate a lot of time to the store that month :(

&amp;#x200B;

[October to November - $7,969.05:](https://i.imgur.com/Ot6mgFk.png) Increased sales by $2,500 this month, woo! I also increased my profit margins from 15% to 25% by switching some suppliers and optimizing my Facebook ads. For the ads, I switched from interest based targeting to LAAs (Lookalike Audiences) so Facebook could find new potential customers for me at a much cheaper cost. I also began writing blog articles that attracted attention and got me some free sales. As an example, I would write articles like ""Top 5 gift ideas for shark lovers"" and share those on social media. This would attract new people to my store, and even better, allow Facebook to re-target them with ads later ;) Gotta get creative!

&amp;#x200B;

[November to December - $17,231.02:](https://i.imgur.com/v22Tn16.png) This was the biggest jump in sales so far, largely because of black friday and the holidays. I also discovered two new ""winning"" products which I'm currently setting my focus on. So I won't be revealing these to you guys, unfortunately (You can't expect me to give my whole business away!). During this month I really buckled down on Instagram, creating a brand and garnering more followers. Also, this month was 30% profit margins.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few things I really want to stress to any newcomers -- As you can see growing a business takes time. I have experience and it still took me 4 months to get to $17,000 in sales. Some may get there faster, and others may get there slower depending on product/niche choice and marketing skills. That's OKAY! Don't be discouraged by this. You also have to remember that your customers are living people, so create a website that looks and feels trustworthy. Would you buy from a website with no contact page or terrible product descriptions? Probably not, so don't expect customers to. Also, I can't stress the importance of re-targeting on Facebook enough... Sending people directly to your product page when they never heard of you is not very efficient. Retarget. Always.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I'm sure some of you are going to be skeptics and question why I'm spending time writing this. I will openly say that outside of dropshipping I enjoy programming and am the owner of [Niche Scraper](https://NicheScraper.com), a tool that helps you research winning products. It's a complete solo operation / hobby of mine that I created after I started my first store. So yes, I would love to increase its exposure. But you really don't NEED it or any other fancy tools to succeed. There's so much free information out there that will take you 99% of the way. It pains me when I hear someone telling me they spent $2,000 on a course and still aren't able to make a sale. If you want to do it, that's completely fine, but don't *ever* feel its a requirement to be successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this post inspires or helps people figure out the right approach to dropshipping by hearing how I did it. I'm happy to answer more specific questions in the comments!

shopify,Here's how to put a product link in a shipment delivered notification email,"Hey everyone,

For our shop we wanted to make it easy for customers to leave a review on the products that they received.  So it seemed like a good way to do that would be in the shipment delivered email notification that they get.  Here are the steps to do that for anyone else that may want to implement that functionality:

1. In your admin go to 'Settings'
2. Click on 'Notifications'
3. Scroll down and click on the 'Shipment Delivered' notification
4. Make sure you're on the 'Email' tab ... (we haven't done this for SMS)
5. If your code is still the standard shopify code, then look for the line that looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    &lt;span class=""order-list__item-title""&gt;{{ line_title }} × {{ line_display }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Then right underneath it add the following line:

     &lt;a href=""{{ shop.url | append: line.line_item.product.url }}""&gt;Leave a product review&lt;/a&gt;

Hit save and then send yourself a test email.  You should now have a 'Leave a product review' link underneath each product shown that will link directly to that particular product page.

If anyone has an easier way to do this, please share!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

Be sure that you have a review app installed first on your store.",16,21,2019-02-01,ECOM,0.0319051556289196,0.9302284121513367,0.03786643594503403
dropship,A lot of noob questions - I apologize in advance.,"So I probably have a typical story of being an adult and working in the healthcare field my entire adult life and getting tired and leaving it to completely redirect myself. I found drop shipping a few months ago and have immersed myself in looking for information ever since. Before I get started with the questions, I'd like to make it clear that I have no intentions on doing this to get rich. I see it as part personal challenge and part supplemental income. Now to my questions:  


1. I know, by large, this community is tight lipped about success and ""how to"". I've run across so many guru's I can hardly see straight. I'm having a hard time finding real applicable information and mostly just see a lot of promising the world with a price. Obviously I'm not interested in paying tons of money to multiple sources just to maybe get some decent information. I'd like to know, for those of you who have had some success, where you source your information from? Which youtubers do you watch, which blogs do you read, so on and so forth. Almost everything I've come across offers ""free information"" and then spends 20 minutes talking about absolutely nothing and tells me if I want the real information, pay xxx at the end of the video. I don't mind paying for information, but there's so much out there it's hard to determine what is real and what's a scam.
2. I already decided that starting a niche store versus a general store is the direction I'd like to go. Now, I understand if no one wants to help with this question but I'm hoping someone will at least offer some input. I've seen a lot of advice about not going with the type of store you're experienced in and rather going for what the market is demanding. I have two store ideas - one is a niche store in the eco-friendly market. I have the name, the design, the brand, everything laid out. I'm still missing the most important parts - products and suppliers... but I'm getting there. However, this store is easy for me to see in my head. It's a great name with a great brand concept and I feel like it holds a lot of promise if I can do it right. Now for the other idea, it's a store centered around my career and professional license. Health and wellness field. I don't have a name, a design, or a brand that I can easily picture in my head. I do have product ideas and have sourced some suppliers. I have a wealth of knowledge of the industry and experience behind me that makes me a trusted source for information or as someone to purchase these products from. If you were in my shoes, based on the little information I've given, which concept holds more promise as a first time store?
3. Last question - if you're still here thank you for sticking with me. In my professional experience, I was a great sales person. I held a rebook rate of 80% with clients I saw and retained around 70% of those clients on a month to month basis. I used my knowledge, education, and experience to give clients a sense of trust in me. Those personal relationships kept them coming back. What I don't understand is how to translate this skill into a digital world. Without the face to face, without the personal interaction, how can I apply these skills to an online store? If you have a resource that touches on translating these skills that would be invaluable. But really I'm just open to any advice. Again, thanks for taking the time.",7,11,2019-02-01,ECOM,0.029851777479052544,0.9275616407394409,0.04258660972118378

ecommerce,Help/Opinion - free shipping or lower product price?,"Hey,

Really need your opinion, both as online costumers and as online sellers.

I think it'll be easier with an example so let's say I'm selling cakes online. The same cakes you can buy at a store in your street for 1€.

I should especify that there's a minimum order value - let's say it's 5€ (this may or not be relevant in your answer).

Now, what's the best option for me as a seller, to sell the cakes for the same value you can find them in a store (I charge 1€) plus a shipping fee (let's say around 2€) or should I charge for each cake a value that's a bit more inflated - let's say 1,20€ - with free shipping?

I know that, from a rational costumers perspective, it all depends on the ammount of cakes ordered. If you order more than 10 cakes it's better to have the shipping fee while in smaller orders it's better to have the price of each product inflated.

However as an online seller, what's my best option? What will gain me more costumers? Having free shipping and a product a bit more costy than you find in traditional commerce or have the product cost the exact same it costs in your local cake place but with a shipping fee to have it delivered to your house?

What's more advantageous for me, to be able to present a product that is economically comparable to what you would find in traditional commerce and do ""free-shipping"" promotions once in a while or to advertise my products and services as with free shipping while having my prices a bit inflated (but with enough brand and website design to justify the price)?

Any opinion or feedback is highly welcomed!

How should one handle dependant resources? If I want to update a variants image, I need to retrieve the product first, since it holds images.

&amp;#x200B;

A while ago I posted about the beta opening of PricingBot, a Shopify app that allows you to monitor your competitors' prices. 

[https://www.pricingbot.co/](https://www.pricingbot.co/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to the feedback of this amazing community I am now proud to say that PricingBot is out of beta.

We’re now in the middle of being published on the Shopify app store, hopefully, this shouldn’t take long. In the meantime, everything works!

We've added a lot of requested features:

* Competitor auto-matching, meaning you just have to give us your competitor domain, and we take care of matching the products you have in common.
* CSV export
* Re-pricing directly from PricingBot
* Multiple formats of the daily report

ecommerce,Shipping Help,"Hi everyone. Looking for some assistance:

I work with a coffee business that is just getting into a formal e-commerce operation. We sell 14 oz. bags of coffee (whole bean or ground), as well as single serving cups in boxes of 12. We've always done 14 oz. and have no intention to go down to 12 oz. at the moment.

For 14 oz. we charge $14, and the cups we charge $12. We're considering doing a $5 flat rate shipping charge passed on to the customer, and using USPS flat rate boxes through PirateShip or Shopify Shipping. The problem is, the flat rate USPS boxes are either too small or too big. If we use our own, then we get a $1+ on shipping fee's, plus at least another $1 on our COGS for the product.

We generally sell 1 or 2 bags per online order. Has anyone had an experience in shipping coffee or a related product regularly that could offer some guidance on where to start or the best way to simplify the whole process?

ecommerce,"Looking for feedback on Matero, a yerba mate shop","Hi ya'll. I recently launched [Matero](https://matero.cc). There's only one product at the moment but I have plans to grow the shop. For years I've built, supported, and consulted eCommerce shops but I realized I never built one for myself for physical products. I decided to ""eat my own dog food"" and launch a yerba mate shop.

&amp;#x200B;

Some more background:

\- I invested a small amount in inventory and it's being shipped via a fulfillment company. I didn't like the idea of it being dropshipped from South America and wanted it to deliver quickly.

\- I'm using WooCommerce as that's my background.

\- While it's technically launched, I haven't started heavily marketing it yet because the warehouse is finishing up inventory. To be shipped this week.

\- I'll be experimenting with Google Merchants/Shopping and Facebook Shop. I could use any tips and guidance here. The feed is correctly going into Google and I do have the product being displayed on Facebook via the page. Do most people purchase ads to make these platforms worth it?

\- I'm especially curious of those on here that have never heard of yerba mate think of the site. Is it clear what it is? Would you try it based on the info I provided?

\- And of course if anyone has any contacts within the yerba mate industry in South America, I'd love to chat. It hasn't been super easy to find contacts and I even speak Spanish.

shopify,The truth about shopify,"Delete if not allowed, this is a question I get repeatedly and maybe it might be of some value to you 

AskJamieA

EP10

Q. Could you tell the truth about Shopify? Me and A LOT of people are being scammed and sold, I thought Shopify would be great for my business but it’s proving otherwise. 

 

A. Thanks for the question, Here’s the thing,

I’ve seen so many people sold the dream by ‘gurus’ on YouTube or Facebook. Being told they will get rich quick, being told they can start with no money etc. I just want to clear it up. Shopify is a platform for business, that’s it. It isn’t magic, it’s not going to work just because it’s Shopify. It is business. Business is business whether it’s online or in a physical store. A business requires the same amount of work whether it’s on Shopify or In a physical store. I see so many people treat it as anything but a business, they have no business plan, no direction and so on.

 

You will not succeed in any business if you aren’t treating it like a business. The difference in successful shopify store owners and non-successful owners are the way they are treating it. The successful owner is treating it like what it is, which is a business and the non-successful person is treating it like what it isn’t, which is a get rich quick scheme. You will not succeed in business without the right mind-set, you will not succeed in business without a business plan. You will not succeed if you have no money to invest in the business. (you can definitely start with less money, I started with £200 and grew my business from there) but you aren’t going to be able to do that without plans, without goals and without a sense of direction.  If you are completely new to eCommerce all together, it doesn’t automatically count you out because everyone including myself, who is good at something started off as a beginner. I learned everything off YouTube and Google.

 

Whether you succeed or not is completely dependent on your mind-set and your intentions. If you come in brand new and decide you’re just going to throw a random store together and run ads with the intention of getting rich quick, you’re going to loose money and you’re going to fail.

 

You need to focus on building your brand. It takes time, just like every business. If you deploy patience everyday and stay in the mind-set that you are building something, you will have greater chances of succeeding vs someone who is rushing in and thinking people will just buy their stuff because they think it’s good stuff, that’s how you go broke, that’s how you loose. You need to give yourself a chance. You need to give the market a chance. You need to position your company as a player in the market before you can position it as the top player or one of the top players in the market. If you sold cola under your own brand you’re not just going to come in and take Coke out. Outside of family and a few close friends, no one gives a f**k about your business and that’s just the truth. In some cases family and close friends don’t even care.  It’s your job to make them care about your business. You have to do the groundwork. You have to create brand awareness, you have to create a demand for your brand and you’re going to do that through your marketing and through your day to day business activities. 

 

What I’m trying to push is patience and intention. For me I know that any worthwhile business is going to take 10 years/20 years etc. to build and that’s just the reality. A lot of people don’t like to hear the reality because they’ve been sold the dream and thought that this time next year they would be sitting in Bora Bora making millions. I’m here to tell you that’s not going to happen, 99.9% of people who open a Shopify store close it within a year and don’t come back. Intention plays a massive part, If your intention was literally to get rich quick then ofcourse you won’t win. You have to love business in the first place. If you know deep down that you aren’t an entrepreneur and you have no passion for whatever it is you’re doing and you’re just jumping on the wave to try and get rich then you’re going to fail.

 

IF you want to succeed, you need to delete everything you think you know , everything you’ve been sold and start from scratch. Re-think it, treat it like a real business. Have a business plan, have marketing plans, do your research and focus on building a real strong, solid foundation for your business. You need to create a demand for your brand/products/services and like I said, you’re going to do that through your marketing efforts and your day to day business activities. It’s going to take years to build a sustainable business but if you are truly an entrepreneur that’s not a deal breaker because you’re going to love the process anyway. You have to love the game when you’re loosing and not just when you’re winning, you have to love the whole thing. If you change your mind-set and understand and accept that it’s going to take years to be successful and then start to formulate a plan of action around that mind-set then that’s how you’re going to win. By understanding this is a business just like Nike just like any other business and then accept the work that you will need to do. That is going to be a formula for winning.

 

If you got into this but don’t know anything about business then accept that learning about business is going to be factored into your process and into your time frame. Start again, treat it like a real business. It is not a get rich quick scheme it is a business.

 

Something I follow is micro speed- macro patience. Which means in the day to day do things quickly, replying to email, updating things, making moves and so on, and thats micro speed- in the day to day be quick, Macro-patience is being patient in regards to your end goal, which could be financial freedom, being one of the biggest players in your market or whatever it is for you. The thing is too many people are doing the wrong thing, in the day to day they are slow but they want their end goal over night. That’s not going to work, so remember, micro speed- macro patience.

 

You need to remember that a Shopify business is a business like any other so treat it like a business. It’s going to be hard and that’s just the way it is. If you develop the correct mind-set and attitude and intentions then you can 100% succeed even if you had no experience to begin with.

 

Start again with the right intentions and the right attitude and the right mind-set and deploy patience x10, understand the thing you are trying to do. Match your timeframe with your goals. If you want to be the biggest or one of the biggest players in your market then look around, live in the real world- who are you competing with?

Companies who have been in the business for years. Do you honestly think your going to come in and within 6 months be the biggest or one of the biggest? You need to be realistic.

 

Accept that it’s going to be shit at first, accept that you are a drop in the ocean, accept that no one gives a f**k about your business yet, and then accept that you need to do something about that. Remember micro-speed and macro-patience.

 

Accept that what you are trying to do is big and that’s going to involve being patient to get there. Stop timing yourself, stop juding yourself , stop worriying what people are going to say, just keep your head down for 10 years and work and it’s that simple. The truth about the Shopify plaform is it’s a business and you need to get your mind right going into it.

 

Thanks for the question hopefully you’ve got some value and maybe even a shift in mind-set in regards to business and success as a whole.

shopify,Ottawa-based Shopify is now Canada’s most valuable tech firm | Ottawa Business Journal,"&gt;What began just over a decade ago as a way for some local entrepreneurs to sell snowboards on the side is now Canada’s most valuable tech company by market capitalization – and the Ottawa firm’s growth doesn’t appear to be slowing.

&gt;Shopify (TSX:SHOP)(NYSE:SHOP) took the title as Canada’s top tech firm on Friday afternoon as its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange crested $222, officially ousting CGI Group from the spot. Shopify’s shares have continued to climb at the start of the week, trading at around $227.81 on Monday and giving the Ottawa e-commerce giant a market capitalization of $22.3 billion.

&gt;Shopify’s shares have risen more than 500 per cent since the firm debuted on the TSX in 2015, raising more than $150 million in its initial public offerings on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange.

&gt;The Ottawa-based firm’s platform, used by more than 600,000 merchants operating digital storefronts, got its start as a custom-coded e-commerce site for CEO Tobi Lütke and co-founders Daniel Weinand and Scott Lake to launch their online snowboard shop back in 2004. The company now employs more than 3,000 people globally and has branched out from its Elgin Street headquarters to a nearby building on Laurier Avenue to make room for its Ottawa expansions.

&gt;Shopify will report its full-year earnings on Feb. 12, when it is expected to hit $1 billion in annual revenues for the first time in its history.

dropship,Aussies dropshippers: can you provide some advise?,"I have a few questions about the back end of ecommerce for beginners, specifically related to Australia:

&amp;#x200B;

When first starting with a dropshipping (or any tentative or small ecommerce business selling things via a website), how does one set it up?

Do I get an ABN?   
One of my currently percolating ideas is actually aimed at the Australian market and to me it would make sense to then get an aussiebusiness.com.au domain for this particular one. Is this true? Do Aussies prefer to buy from a .com.au site?  
Is there any other reason to get an ABN? Is an ABN obligatory?

What about a business bank account and/or credit card?  
When I read that credit card blocks are a bit more common in this environment (suspicion of fraudulent use due to regular purchases with constantly changing shipping address), is it wise to get a separate card and notify the provider of the cc about the nature of the business and the consequence of the ever changing shipping addresses?

Insurance, do you need them or want them and which one? I know hobby sellers on a local markets or shows need some form of public liability, but think that one is more for when personal interaction go bottoms up, i.e. someones kid banged their head on the corner of your table after tripping over it's feet, but claiming to have tripped over your power supply - something like that.  
Is it needed to protect from or be covered for customer claims? Is it mandatory in certain situations?

Whether you've just started, or are a seasoned serial entrepreneur operating from Australia, I would really value and appreciate some tips or pointers on the above.

I have read quite a bit here  and elsewhere, but am still mystified by a few things related to startup costs.  
I read that you can start with bugger all or a $500,- budget and then see lists with breakdowns of the start costs, but I never see anything budgetted for commercial/business bank accounts/cards, or insurance and related overhead.

Am I overthinking, overly cautious? Is this something that people just don't bother with at all?",20,4,2019-02-06,ECOM,0.06941656023263931,0.9066565036773682,0.023926962167024612

dropship,A different path in dropshipping,"Can't stand this anymore. Everyone and their dog is trying to dropship from China. Then they complain dropshipping is dead. Also, Aliexpress is already so well known that even end-consumers buy their stuff from there. If you're trying to do the same as everyone else, how come you expect to be successful, as in ever.

I came here today to try to show you a different way. No, dropshipping isn't dead but doing the same ol' thing definitely is.

Yes, sourcing items from China is cheap. Or is it, really? Take this into account:

- **Long delivery time.** Getting items by sea? That's a loong time. When you get out of items, you can't source more quick. That is (again) profit loss that actually goes into the item entry price... makes it more expensive, although you can't see it. By air? It costs you an arm and leg.

- **Unpredictable, sudden costs** (anything can happen when importing) - often not taken into account; at all. Or, fake merchandise or whatever else, having them seized by customs.

- The fact that **anyone can clone your business overnight**; you have to be always looking for new stuff to sell. They just go to Ali*.

- **About everyone else is doing the same thing** as you, selling the same items, pushing down the prices

- **MOQ's are high** - how many items should you risk buying in your batch? 1000? 10K? The Chinese seller won't settle for less quantity. What about market changes such as wild sales fluctuations? You're completely at risk with that. See how many here are complaining on a daily basis about a lot of stock they still have unsold of a certain item.

- **Quality issues** - to ensure you always ship the same quality to your users, you'd better move to China yourself. Sellers there are known for wild quality fluctuations.

- **Not getting the goods at all** - or getting broken ones. Happens. I've had that too.

And so on. I'm stopping here cause I think I made my point by now.

Now. I've been selling goods online for 10 years (in Europe). We do have a limited physical presence and stock; but guess what, we could have been fine without it as today we dropship about everything we can. Only a small number of local buyers might come to pick in person. 

We also used to import, and wholesale. Not anymore. As an online retailer, we understood over the years that the best and most efficient way is to purchase locally from a variety of suppliers keeping the stock for us (and the risk as well).

This being said:

- Look for **local suppliers.** They should be plenty for any niche.

- The price is often higher; but **if you factor all hidden costs above, it will actually be cheaper in most cases**. Also, if you factor in quality control, existing volume relationships they have, you might actually get a far better price for a high quality item.

- Note, you will get **far quicker delivery times = more sales = bigger profits**

- **You can always return and/or exchange items** at your local suppliers, most decent suppliers will be alright with that if you're a regular (try shipping anything back to China instead)

- **Meet them in person.** Go there and visit their office and warehouse. Negotiate discounts. Be a person. Be that person they know well and trust. They will get far better trust in you, in this way. Build a relationship, will you. Most newbie sellers don't understand that you don't partner with businesses - you partner with people working at businesses.

- **Build volume over time.** Then re-negotiate, again and again. That's how you make profits. Without significant volume, you'll never be able to be successful. Scale horizontally too - handle as many SKU's as you can. Have different product lines in several niches if possible.

- **Build a brand.** Even if just dropshipping, why not? Your brand is your future. To your most faithful customers you will be a brand even if you're working from your apartment and go by your name (""John's Shoes""). (long story I had suppliers like that too and they were great)

- **Go to industry fairs.** That's where everyone who matters is. That's where they will know you are a customer that matters. That's where you build new relationships, find new products, etc.

- And for God's sake, **make a decent website (branded)** with a reasonable theme and quality, not the same rubbish shop with the same basic theme as everyone else.

Final comment, just as an example, a year ago I've been visiting a large supplier in Manchester, UK. Long story but the thing is, their best reseller was a dropshipper with nothing but a website, an office and phones. 2 brothers, actually. They never ever touched a single piece of the items, yet they were making millions per year.

*Half-baked businesses don't work. Doing the same thing as everyone else doesn't as well.* Think different. Be different. That's how you stand off from the crowd.

Good luck!

Edit: Oh, and another thing - saw yesterday someone's comment, ""I'm still looking for my successful product"". 

Yet another kind of thinking that doesn't make sense. At all. You don't need a successful product; you need a successful process. Someone else is already selling that and making money - how come you can't? Identify your strengths, weaknesss and knowledge and choose products based on that. Then build proper processes. It's not the product's fault. Not to mention, if you rely on a *single product* to create a successful business, you're building sandcastles. 1 year ahead, chances are you won't be selling that particular item anymore. Successful e-commerce businesses (dropship or not) rely on horizontal scaling, having many different product lines with lots of different items being sold.",45,97,2019-02-07,ECOM,0.042907584458589554,0.9187635481357574,0.03832888975739479
dropship,How to use videos in your Facebook Ads to warm up cold audiences!,"Are you creating Facebook Ads and targeting them to your ideal audience but they don't convert as you hoped to? Of course, they don't! When was the last time you saw an ad and said: ""OMG I need to get that product NOW""? Exactly! 

The problem is some advertisers just starting out is they think that they can find some products that are trending, whip up some okay-ish Facebook ads and will be soon making a lot of sales! This post isn't written to help you sale your product but rather share an interesting way to warm up your audience and make them more receptive to your Facebook Ads and ultimately buy!  


# ▶ How to use Facebook Video in your ads

If you are not using Facebook videos then you should! **Create Facebook videos for your products**. Make sure that the video is **educational and provides value**. What are the pain points your product is trying to solve? How it!  DO NOT make it **sales-y**! **The goal isn't to sale** but rather find the right people out of those viewers and target those. When people watch your videos -and especially those who have watched a great deal of it they are telling you that they are interested in this. 

# ▶ How should your videos look like - Inspiration

Your videos should be engaging and fun to watch. You can always look for inspiration in your competitors! Do not steal their videos to use them on your ads. Respect their work. Here are a few tips:

💣 Go to your competitors Facebook page and visit the Info and Ads tab. See what their videos look like and make yours better!

💣 Don't have the money? Find users that made a video of their purchased product (from your competitor) and ASK THEM FOR PERMISSION to re-use it in your ads. 

💣 Aren't any videos made by customers? You can use still images and GIFs of your product and use Facebook's video kit to create a cool, animated video.

&amp;#x200B;

# ▶ Optimising your Facebook video ads 

When creating this type of ads be sure to optimise for video views (and Thruplay) if this option is available to you. You will get few - zero clicks but that's okay (you can have a link in your ad copy). You don't want to get them to buy at the moment. You want to see if they are interested in your product and qualify them before you take them to the next part! Video views are quite cheap. Cheaper than clicks and conversions. You want to target large audiences and be sure to have the right interests in place.

# ▶ Retarget video viewers

This is where the magic happens. Create audiences based on the view percentage. You can experiment but have in mind the following:  
💣 You want to create audiences for high-percentage viewing, 75% and higher.

💣 Depending on the duration, you should consider different increments - 50%, 75% etc.

💣 Experiment with different seconds-viewerships

Once you have created your custom audiences THEN you will retarget them with the type of ads you'd normally create with your goal to push them lower into your funnel. Don't forget to make the necessary exclusions! You don't want to waste money targeting the same people.

Here you can find screenshots of the audiences and campaigns on [how to warm up cold audiences with videos](https://newsfeed.org/how-to-warm-cold-audiences-with-facebook-video-ads/).

shopify,[New app] Thanks for all the support /r/Shopify. Shoppy is now available in the App store!,"Hi everyone!

A while back, I shared my first ever Shopify app with you all--Shoppy--to get feedback. Shoppy is an app that is built with Rails and lets you receive order notifications and order summary reports by day, week, and month directly in Slack, which allows you to drastically reduce your reporting time. In that first post, I shared that I was building Shoppy because no other Shopify + Slack bot in the app store included UTM tracking, discount codes, and tags. 

After sharing my post, I received so much amazing feedback, had a few crashed in production, and I learned a lot about the differences between a development and production app (Pro tip for developers: always do your Shop lookup using the ""myshopify_domain"" field rather than ""domain"" because real stores have custom domains in the ""domain"" field!).

Now, Shopify has finally approved Shoppy for the App Store, and it can be officially installed here: https://apps.shopify.com/shoppy-a-better-shopify-slack-app-by-emerald-io 

I can't thank you all enough for your support, and if you use Slack with Shopify, I hope you give Shoppy a try.

Also, in the effort to give more than I take, I'll share a few more tips that I learned through the app submission process:

1. Start getting users and feedback early! Finding communities like this allowed me to have a much more successful day 1. In fact, my 5-star review is from my first alpha user that I found because of /r/shopify.
2. If you're submitting your App store listing, follow these tips based off of my own personal mistakes:
- Do not reference ""Shopify"" in your app name or tagline. You can mention other apps though (e.g. my app uses Slack so I reference Slack).
- If you're developing a freemium app, do not mention your other pricing tiers in the general description text box. It does seem like you can include these in your screenshots, or you can include them in the pricing section of your app description. 
- The name of your app in the App store must match the name of the app when it is installed. I thought I could do a more marketing heavy one after the app is installed, but clearly, I was wrong. Just make sure the app names are identical, and you won't have any issues.
- The App store submission process was pretty long for me. It took 20 days to get more first round of feedback. Then, another 10 days after I made changes to get it approved. If it takes around 30 days, don't fret! 

Best of luck to everyone! And if you have any questions about developing a Shopify app, the app stoer submission process, or Shopify in general, I'd be happy to answer any questions!",1,17,2019-02-07,ECOM,0.0368509478867054,0.9314931631088257,0.031655922532081604

I've now made several sales online and my store is starting to pick up some attention. I've been approached by magazines Conde Nast Traveler, House Beautiful, and now Glamour for (paid) features in upcoming issues.

**I'd probably jump at these opportunities, but I'm concerned with one thing:** the Chinese packaging from my AliExpress-shipped products.

I feel like my store looks great, and the product themselves are good. Though when the customer receives a product, it's covered in Chinese packaging, which I feel causes an immediate disconnect from my brand and loses all the trust straight away.

I've reached out to my suppliers and they are not willing to place any branding of mine in the packaging.

These magazine placements would likely bring a lot of traffic to the store, and while I'd normally welcome it, I don't want to let a whole bunch of people down.

ecommerce,how to successfully start dropshipping?,"Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start my own dropshipping business, but first i want to learn everything there is about it. I don't want to rush into it, i wanna take my time, take it slowly and hopefully succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

As i believe there are many scam youtube videos of people just trying to sell their course, i would rather ask you people who actually succeeded in this and not brag about it, but are still willing to share some knowledge here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

How did you guys start? What articles/books did you read before you started out and during, to keep a successful business going?

dropship,Question for the experienced dropshipper,"Hello,

In early January I started a Shopify store, it quickly progressed and to keep things simple, it did $3000 in revenue in 22 days.

I then took a two week break from the store and stopped running ads to focus on other things.

I have returned and duplicated the ads I previously ran exactly but now I’m getting little to no sales. Nothing has changed on the store itself and the ads are identical in terms of ad spend.

An ad set has had £700 spent on it and maintained a £9.50 cost per purchase. The past couple days I have spent £180 on that identical ad and only got 3 purchases from it.

I’m even getting similar amounts of visitors to the store but just not converting despite no changes to the store.

And yes I’ve checked payment providers are working fine.

Any advice would be appreciated.",7,3,2019-02-08,ECOM,0.0805291160941124,0.853717029094696,0.06575384736061096
shopify,Slate v1.0 beta is pretty solid - Migrated a Plus store to Slate 1.x with no ragrets,"TL:DR Slate 1.x is worth a look and might be better than your current workflow


This post is for developers who work in the ‘classic’ Shopify way i.e. you have an environment with config files that point to theme IDs, some of which may be a sandbox.

A brief history of Slate - Slate 0.x had good intentions, as did Timber ( now obsolete ). More than a starting point for themes, it was a starting point for Shopify to be able to reason about its support of commercial themes long term. What Slate O.x lacked was tooling - it was a black box. Do it the Slate way or the highway.

That wasn’t very appealing to existing stores that most likely used Shopify’s amazing Themekit along with a custom webpack/gulp/grunt/whatever workflow.

^ This was ( and for most still ) is paradise... until scale caught up with us.

I head dev on a plus store with dozens of custom product/collection/page templates all with their corresponding sections and their respective schema. Honestly - following best practices this shit is still unwieldy - waiting 1-2min for the ‘customize’ button in themes to load up the visual editor was the norm. If you didn’t get a legit browser alert timeout error.

Why not just use the Storefront API at scale? Well, maybe in the future. Currently it has some major limitations.  We have business logic that shopify handles well with apps ( public and private ) that let’s us integrate natively with awesome 3rd parties. I wont drop names but you get a lot less headaches with a lot of stuff if you render your site on your Shopify domain vs doing it through Storefront. And I’m not talking about drop-in feature apps like 90% of the app store. I am talking about core business logic involving ESPs, CRMs,Analytics, et all.

What makes working with modern tooling and optimization on Shopify challenging is you can’t ( yet ) locally parse/render Shopify templates ( truly ) locally in order to do some things inline critical css, perform static analysis, etc. its not like firing up creat-react-app if you want native Shopify. Its a unique snowflake.... So we manually split bundles willy-nilly into a few chunks through webpack.

For the most part we had a theme.js/css and a few templates were broken manually like collections/products and pages.js/css

Pages ended up being our problem because we kept making them - new layouts, new evolutions - and all with section schema.

Ok, back to Slate 1.x and why its cool.

Slate 1.x has a slate config file where you can extend the internal webpack config - which has a ton of great stuff going on. Now you can actually use PostCSS, or extend  your testing/staging environments.

Regarding Slates new internal webpack config - boom - actual Hot Module Reloading. It works and its DOPE. Its fast as all h ll. Yes - you will have problems and read the github issues setting it up- but I can def say it works very well. And doing what the Slate team has done by yourself would be a whole thing. thats why its been years and years in the making.

So yeah Slate 1.x is cool... let’s talk about reality.

End of last year we had some resources to improve on things. It took about a week to take our existing plus store from a bespoke webpack build process to slate.

We did the proof of concept in a new git repository before we carefully moved everything in a new production branch - as to not lose each files git history. 

And why not just manually improv our bespoke webpack config? Because slate has very cool stuff under the hood - notably - code splitting and the code splitting can be very aggressive as you need.

Slate has an opinionated file structure. If you adhere to it, the bonuses come a’plenty. In their folder structure, scripts/layout_name.js gets a bundle as does templates/template_name.js ( if the liquid files exist in corresponding folders ). When you do a slate build, it will look to see if a template/some-file.liquid has a corresponding .js. If it does it will bundle a vendor and a template-specific file.

So we were able to take dozens of es modules that were previously split into maybe 3-4 bundles to having them split and loaded with lazer focus with Slate, creating super optimized template and shared bundles. 

To be more specific we went from like 4-5 template js files plus a single vendor bundle to about 2 dozen js and css files.

Yep, we now generate more code not less. But we ship it in a way that reduces just about everything, from initial load, ttfp, tti,... overall we increased out performance by 25-30% just by breaking out more entry points.

I skipped a lot and theres tons more to this, but we’re definitely using slate in production on a major plus store and all is well. 


( mostly... the more people that use it and contribute the better it gets )

Give slate a shot and def RTFM - its pretty famn good.

ecommerce,What platform?,"I run a small business that retails to a niche market. I carry all my own stock and have 400-500 skus. I have a small store but most my business is done b2b via email or via Amazon and my Website. My website is currently on Shopify but is fairly basic. I do some sales through it but I want to grow this.

I find that Shopify is great to get a basic site up and going easily but I quickly started spotting loads of things it doesn't do without paying for apps. For example, you can't do these without an paid for app: have a Store collection button, file upload for customers, any control over what items can use what shipping method, a decent search function for customers and so on. As soon as you add these things on you add hundreds onto your monthly subscription. 

Here's the problem. I don't know if I should just double down and commit to using Shopify and pay for these apps (and some external help)  to enhance my store. Or should I move to another platform? And if so, what one?

I don't have crazy budgets to pay for a developer to go and work on the site for me. I can afford a bit of help but not much therefore a lot would have to be done by me.

I have a client who wants me to put a canva template into WooCommerce emails with a custom footer and header image. The header image I know can be set from WooCommerce settings however as far as customising the footer html I am a little bit more confused about that. I haven't been able to find any information about this - the best I could find was the email template 'customer-invoice.php' however it uses this action for the footer:

'do\_action( 'woocommerce\_email\_header', $email\_heading, $email ); ?&gt;'

&amp;#x200B;

However I have not had success finding out what output this action actually outputs. Searching online has not produced any clarification. 

Basically what I want to do is:

a) See what HTML is currently being produced in place of woocommerce\_email\_header or more imporatntly 

do\_action( 'woocommerce\_email\_footer', $email );

and simply copy paste that into my template file and modify it as required.

woocommerce,Best way to capture customer emails for multiple purposes very early in the purchase process?,"Small e-commerce shop, having a higher-than-desired level of abandoned carts and trying to improve our direct mail list.

&amp;#x200B;

We have three different ways of acquiring the customer's email:

1. Through order checkout. As long as they check out as far as entering their email. If they complete checkout, a Mailchimp plugin adds them to our MailChimp list.
2. Through explicit Mailchimp signup on a sidebar promo call to action. This sends them a greeting email which includes a discount coupon code which changes monthly. This is done through a different Mailchimp integration plugin.
3. Through a long-delay popup that happens if they've been on the site for a bit. This is done through a third plugin, Popup Maker with its Mailchimp extension.

Now, what concerns me is that none of these components interact.

&amp;#x200B;

We have an Abandoned Cart Recovery plugin, but it only has the user's email if they entered it partway through the checkout process but didn't complete it. If they signed up for MailChimp via either method, the Cart plugin is unaware of the email address and can't try to send automated promotional emails for abandoned carts sweetening the deal to try to recover and close the sale.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, if the regular sidebar Mailchimp plugin captures the user's email, it doesn't have any way to inform the popup maker to keep quiet. (I think I can solve this by setting a cookie, but the Mailchimp plugin doesn't seem to offer this ability out of the box.)

&amp;#x200B;

ecommerce,Software for stock management across 3 platforms and 2 warehouses?,"My wife is newly working for a small but succesful, family run, clothing business, that has a physical store, an Etsy store and a Shopify store.

They also have one warehouse in Spain and one in India.

At the moment the only inventory management they have is a shared google spreadsheet which has been *kind of* working until now, but they are at the point where they need a better (more automated) solution.

One particular problem that triggered the realisation that the current system is inadequate, is when they have one bespoke high value product listed on both Etsy and Shopify (common for their business) and for example it is sold on Etsy, it needs to immediately be marked as out of stock on Shopify. Currently it is still listed until somebody first updates the google sheet and then updates Shopify. Not ideal.

So, if somebody could suggest a user friendly, not super expensive solution that they have used and would endorse, that would be very much appreciated.

I currently have a wordpress shop powered by woocommerce, but it takes quite a bit of time keeping everything updated and functioning properly (I just did an update and it broke my landing page quiz). I'm thinking about switching to Shopify, and was looking for some theme recommendations. What is important to me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fast, clean, HTML5/CSS. I like my sites to load very fast.
2. Nice block style blog like this: [Array Publisher](https://preview.arraythemes.com/publisher/page/2/)

I have about 48 hours to move my initial stock of Valentine's cards which is 300, 100 of each. I don't see it happening online, so I'll be pushing it in Person heavily the next couple of days. 

Thank God for Shopify POS which makes things easier with their chip/card reader. But we'll see how it goes in Person. I hope to at the very least move half of my Valentine's inventory in order to expand my collection of cards. If not, expansion may take a little longer than I'll be hoping for.

shopify,3 ECOMMERCE CONVERSION TIPS,"I have been taking notes from day one on my ecommerce journey. Today I went back to my notes to see the things that had the most impact on my own and clients ecommerce success. So instead of my notes going to grave with me, I am sharing it here so someone else can learn and see success through it. Without any further, let's jump right into my 3 ecommerce conversion tips.

1. No Surprises with price  
Think of a product you like, and you get to know that you cannot afford it just before when it comes to making payment. In short, customers do not like surprises when it comes to the price.  
Display price on the product page itself; and if you are giving discounts or deals, list them there. Do not make them wait until the item has been added to the shopping cart or until they check out. Also, do not keep the delivery and handling charges hidden. It may lead to cart abandonment.

2. Reduce Choices  
More is not better. More options to choose leads customers to confusion.  
Trust me Most of your customers has Analysis Paralysis. So when you give them multiple variants of products to choose from they often get confused and either they leave your store or look at some other places for recommendations. When I say some other places I meant Google. When you search on google for a product there is a high chance for customers to find an exact duplicate of your product for a better price. So they will stick with them without getting back to your store.

3. User-Generated Content  
There’s nothing like a happy customer to help another make the decision to purchase. From customer testimonials and product reviews to social media images, anything that can be displayed towards the end of the purchase process that will help your cause should be incorporated. And to add urgency, include pop-ups that detail products which have recently been purchased by other shoppers.

Before you take out your credit card and start scheduling facebook ads, make sure that your store is set up for success and that you won't be leaving any money on the table.

I've landed myself into a bit of a conundrum. I recently inherited a team of 7 members which I manage remotely, on top of my two employees.

On-site merchandising and customer nurturing.

Off site traffic and strategic partnerships.

I've been asked to present my preferred career path in a meeting next week and we will re-jigger the company as needed to make the role work. It's awesome having that kind of sway, but I'm also a little weary that this could be a potential career changing move. Thoughts on where the best stability and long term benefits lie?

Long story short, for the last 3 months i've been working on a project completely based on a instagram account i grew since may 2018. It was a 200,000+ followers account with over 5M impressions a week and 30-40k average likes in the science niche. I was going to open the website/blog with a dropshipping store (main income source) attached in late february/early march. Then, mid january instagram decided to disable my page no reasons given. Never received any kind of warning and i'm 100% sure i never did any type of violations. Since then i tried every conventional method to get back the account but no luck (live chat support, disabled account forms etc). What do you think i should do? The website domain, logo and basically the whole concept behind it is useless without the instagram page because it was not a random repost page but it actually had a 'personal side' and people refered to it as they do with normal influencers. I had invested a lot both in the page and in the website, and as of now i basically lost everything",15,13,2019-02-14,ECOM,0.06382276862859726,0.9089029431343079,0.02727433107793331
ecommerce,“Relaunching” older product - FB data - UA,"So essentially up until around mid to late January I was selling a product at an incredibly solid rate with awesome results. 

The “trend” died but I had fantastic ads that held on tight. I had to kill a majority, but the ones left have been doing well since as the product isn’t necessarily based on the trend but rather a part of it.

That being said, with spring coming the trend is most likely going to see a revival. I will keep the remaining ads running for obvious reasons until then. So my question is, with the revival, should I restart via cold targetting but for the theme of this revival, LAA audiences but only for people who are AFTER the “trend” died, or both?

LAA audiences for people who are AFTER the “trend” died makes sense to me as they most likely bought the product in anticipation for the upcoming seasons.

Cold targetting on the other hand allows me to spice up my data and add more variability and depth than I might have had before.

dropship,Wholesale dropshipping from US suppliers faster shipping times,"I see a lot of posts in this sub about dropshipping from China and using suppliers from aliexpress.
While this is a viable business model, I just wanted to share my own experience sourcing from US vendors and wholesale suppliers. 

So I’ve been dropshipping for around 3 years on eBay, amazon and bonanza. I mainly source from wholesale companies and manufacturers located in the US who are able to ship them item same or next day. The items are brand name or higher quality and have fast shipping times. So why doesn’t everyone work with these companies?

In order to purchase from a wholesale company in the USA you need to provide tax exemption documentation. This is because the companies won’t charge you sales tax and they need a copy of your resale certificate to show the government we sold something and didn’t collect sales tax because he is the one selling it retail. 
This might sound complicated but it’s pretty straight forward. To register for sales tax exemption and the right to collect sales tax takes very little time and in most states doesn’t cost a thing. You don’t need to register a business but you will need to remit those sales taxes to the state. 

All in all, I think this is the next step in dropshipping as you get access to brand name high quality items and have quick shipping times. You are building a business and this isn’t as easy as throwing up a bunch of items from aliexpress. 
I recently started selling on shopify and I am experimenting with how it will go using wholesale suppliers but do far so good, 
You can mainly find these companies on google, directories or even on Facebook.",18,23,2019-02-15,ECOM,0.03879235312342644,0.9324333667755127,0.02877425029873848

I am selling a specific product XYZ that I want to advertise on FB.

It is likely that any individual who visits website ABCDEFG.com will be interested in my product. I want to target those people specifically, and I know facebook tracks your cookies somewhat.

I do not own website ABCDEFG, and am not sure if it has any facebook pixel, or facebook like buttons. I have looked at the source code, and it has some mention of fb, but im not positive.

1.is this possible to only target someone on fb if they have visited a specific third part website url?


2.if it is possible, does that website have to have some type of fb integration setup for facebook to track that an fb user has been to the site for this whole idea to work?

shopify,"2 months, no sales, shutting it down!","Well, not every story is a success story so figured ide drop a line for anyone in “research” phase of their store. After 2 months pushing men’s wedding bands on my online store, FB, Insta, Google etc, I am shutting it down. 

This started as a way for me to really learn FB and Insta from the business side instead of consumer side and in that sense it was a success.

Lessons learned:
1. Without the right product, it doesn’t matter how good your store is, how many marketing channels you have, how good your add campaigns are, it just doesn’t matter without the right product2market fit. Your product must be unique, be a value-add in one way or another, and be PREMIUM. The look, and perception of being a premium product should be in your top list of things to do. 
2. White label white label white label - GROW a brand, your products, packaging etc need to have your brand, don’t just resell the same old recycled crap everyone else is selling or things that can be bought on amazon 
3. If you are getting an ass ton of clicks, page visits etc, but nobody is ever adding anything to cart, most likely your marketing is good, but the product is not appealing enough, or is priced wrong. 
4. NO stock photos. This is a massive red flag, don’t have stock photos, this goes back to the premium thing, stock photos scream cheap recycled Chinese shit. Hire someone on fiverr or wherever who specializes in photography for products online and have the samples shipped straight to them from your supplier. 

Anyways, hope this helps some of you guys! There is a lot of info on Shopify out there but I really just want to drill home how important the actual product is, if it isn’t correct, everything you do after the product becomes a wash. 

All the best.

ecommerce,How to frankenstein edit shopify sites? Ex. I want to copy the cart system of one theme and place it in my own theme.,"I'm starting out with the free Debut theme. I've been able to customize it to my liking except for a couple things. I'm hoping to make some further edits to it outside the scope of the drag and drop stuff.

For example, I dislike in debut that the ""Add to Cart"" Button goes straight to the cart page. I prefer a drawer cart system such as this https://imgur.com/a/3GlehtN. This is part of a free theme called boundless so the code is editable.

Is there anyway I can strip the code for the cart drawer system and apply this to debut? I contacted shopify support but of course they recommended I pay for a theme editor. I think it's past my skillset to make changes beyond just copying and pasting but I was wondering if this is possible and if so how to do it.

I suspect it doesn't quite work like that, just to experiment with copying and pasting I took a ""Text Column with Images"" homepage section and copy and pasted it as a new section in two other free themes that didn't have it and it showed up in the theme but came out pretty fucked up in both times.

*Video version of this post:* [*https://youtu.be/zbgl6SaONvY*](https://youtu.be/zbgl6SaONvY)  

First of all, I usually don't like to self promote. However, I think this issue has gotten far out of hand, and I wanted to reach as wide of an audience as possible.  

This is a PSA to all people out there who are thinking about buying dropshipping courses, programs, inner circles, etc.  

I'm going to be as straightforward as possible: **Stay Away.** 
 
I've taken several of these courses and trust me, they are not worth the money at all.  

It's kind of mind-boggling, to be honest. There are people out there charging $300-1000 for a course, which has no new information at all. You end up getting upselled on even more offers and you end up wasting a lot of time.  

And, I know people say to invest in yourself and to educate yourself. However, buying courses from these guru's is just not a wise investment in general.  

There's an insane amount of content on Youtube and there's no reason to buy a course when everything is there for free.  

And to those thinking that the course may contain some magical content, that once you implement you'll start to be successful, trust me. It's simply not the case.  

I probably forgot some things but I'll add more to this in the next couple days. Comment your thoughts, and as always, my goal is to start a discussion that needs to be had, and I think Reddit is a fantastic place to do that.",35,33,2019-02-17,ECOM,0.02345513179898262,0.9301287531852722,0.04641606658697128

I’m trying to decide the best route to take it. I have experience with web development and would have no problem setting up an online store. I also own a brick and mortar screen print shop and could market many items produced in-house for maximum margins. 

What kind of results can you expect with this type of audience? Page is targeted to 60s and 70s music fans. A lot of middle aged men and woman who are passionate about that era. 

Are we best served focusing on building an email list and marketing that way? Are affiliate programs selling ourselves short considering we can make many items in house (apparel, stickers, art, etc)? Is promoting through posts and funneling to the site the best approach?

* Affordable, solves problem: **Sellbrite**
* Expensive, possibly solves future problems: **ChannelAdvisor**

I'm pretty happy with Sellbrite, the problem being the higher ups are very into tech and feel that what we're building might best be a fit for ChannelAdvisor, and that it might better to implement software of that size now instead of later. To be specific, building products in one place (Sellbrite) is nice, but the idea that you can basically live in ChannelAdvisor and manage your listings, inventory, and then advertising, reporting, analytics...that's a nice feature as well.

We are a Norwegian agency, currently diving into the wonderful world of ecommerce together with a lot of customers in the startup industry. I spend a lot of time on understanding and researching more advanced tracking techniques for ecommerce, as I work a lot with performance marketing and conversions. I love Julian Juennemans tutorials through Measureschool, which has a lot on GTM, analytics and Facebook Pixel/analytics.

As I said, I spend a lot of time understanding this, but I also need help to implement the right kind of tracking and setup within the data layer and in a way the helps the customer to fully understand their customer journey. I\`m therefore looking for a agency or partner that can help me with the correct setup for our customers. The agency/partner will be working directly with me on setting up things correctly in backend and will be paid by my agency.

Private persons with higher understanding and demonstrated skills/results can of course also contact us about this. As I said these are startups in Norway that wish to expand abroad.

dropship,Getting traffic from FB groups. Does it work?,"**TL;DR -** You can grow your business without paid ads. You just gotta give a little to get a lot of traffic.

Hey everyone, Paco here from Oberlo. Lately, my team has been producing lots of content that talks about the **real cost of starting up a dropshipping business**. We’re looking to outline realistic budgets and set reasonable expectations for what it’s going to cost you to get your business to turn a profit.

The truth is, ad network campaigns can be expensive to ramp up. And we want to be clear about that with our merchants right from the onset. When you advertise on Google, Facebook, Instagram etc., in most cases you can expect to pay a dollar per click or more.  That’s especially true when you’re just starting out (and haven’t even turned a profit yet). If you don’t have any prior marketing knowledge, you’ll also need to factor in the learning curve effect, which will inevitably cost you a little more dough than you might have thought when you started your campaigns.

Ad campaigns are expensive. And they're more expensive for new dropshippers, who lack the expertise to get a good ROI out of them and also lack the cashflow to fund them. So for new dropshippers, getting free store traffic is the most cost-effective way to drive sales.

I want to share a prime example of a way to drive traffic with no money whatsoever. It is a simple way to find hyper-engaged buyers and begin driving traffic to your store.

For the budget conscious solo-preneurs out there, [**Chapter 3**](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/get-sales-dropshipping/facebook-groups) of our [**50 Ways To Get Sales With Dropshipping**](https://www.oberlo.ca/ebooks/get-sales-dropshipping) is an excellent place to start. Marketers underestimate the power of monetizing online forums and Facebook Groups. You can find large audiences (in the tens or hundreds of thousands) that are interested in what you’re selling.

**So how do you drive sales from these online spaces? It’s simple. You provide value.**

An entrepreneur that is truly serious about building a long-term online business will undoubtedly be focussed on providing value to their audience on day one. This is the mindset of a successful entrepreneur. The more you give, the more you receive.

If you join Facebook groups and online forums related to your niche, you will find a community of like-minded individuals having in-depth conversations about the products you sell. And once you provide value  in these forums, your posts are there forever. There is a huge residual benefit to posting in forums and Facebook groups that paid ads cannot provide.

**Do you think it’s smart to give something of value away? Do you think there’s real ROI in this marketing strategy?**

That’s the only way this works. You’re not there to spam the community. It’ll get you removed promptly. You’re there to add value. And if you do that, sales will soon follow.

In the early days, paid ads are very useful to ramp things up quickly, but the sooner you start to focus on organic, free traffic, the sooner you can increase your profit margins and rely less heavily on the hungry, hungry ad networks. Over time, you should be able to spend less on paid advertising as you build your audience and create awareness\*\*.\*\*

shopify,Amazon has changed the game in e-commerce marketing and it's time for small stores to catch up,"Blog post aimed at stores that don't use personalised content yet thinking it's too hard or expensive. Sorry to say but your customers aren’t one-size-fits-all so your marketing shouldn’t be either. What you can and should be doing at the very least is using “dynamic messaging” campaigns, rather than old school “batch and blast”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dynamic messaging campaigns have been the secret weapon of big e-commerce businesses for years. But while this type of marketing used to be complicated and expensive to set up, it’s now becoming easier than ever.

shopify,3 Powerful Ways of Overcoming Shopper’s Desire to Touch Products,"Ecommerce product development for online platforms has increased. Mainly because online shopping is common as it’s convenient for buyers. In fact, many shoppers check products on physical stores before buying online.

However, online shopping in product development has one big disadvantage i.e. a shopper cannot touch the product.

In this blog post, we will discuss three useful ways for overcoming shopper’s desire to touch products. Thus, customer experience will improve and overall buying behavior of a website too.

### 1- Photos

Use context based images such as how the product is working. No doubt product features listing in description is important but try to illustrate them in graphical images.

Second, don’t miss out on zoom filter. The finer a shopper can see into the details of the product, the more he will trust the product. Also, show close-ups in image gallery of product detail page.

### 2- Video

A picture is worth thousand words. Imagine a video telling a whole product story. A video shows better how human interaction is related with product. Also, how the product is making ‘a process’ easy. In simple words, how a customer experience is improving.

Videos bridge gap of ‘how the product can be used’ in real time. Images may take time for building an understanding. Video does that in short span.

Videos are effective especially:

\-Explaining high tech products, especially which involves assembly of products.

\-Showcasing client / customer testimonials.

\-Brand recognition.

### 3- Customer reviews

Reviews make selling products easy in a way that customer starts trusting the brand. Shoppers answer questions / concerns of the customer who may be thinking of buying one.

Build a review system which includes photos and videos uploading. Reviews reduces uncertainty factor of a potential customers.

Genuine customer reviews go long way in accrediting the brand with credibility.

ecommerce,"Did not receive very expensive order marked as delivered, Amazon says it's not their problem","I placed this order in January. A lot of it was for my friends (they wanted to use my Prime shipping) whom would be paying me back. I live in a student house with five roommates, and I was away when the items were ""delivered,"" but they were expecting the packages. I've known these guys for a long time and trust all of them a great deal. I got back the next day and my order wasn't there. Looked everywhere, in and around my house—nothing. My roommates and neighbours both said that nothing came in my name. I wasn't too worried at this point because some of the packages required signature confirmation, but I was already a little pissed off because the items were supposed to arrive when I was home, and they were ""delivered"" days late, while I was visiting family.

So I went on live chat with Amazon and they told me to check with the nearest Canada Post. I did, and they said the same thing, that nothing came in. I told Amazon, then they said they would be investigating with Canada Post and told me to wait 5-7 days for an update. 7 days later, no update.

I went on live chat again, they said the investigation was inconclusive and instructed me to file a police report with my local police department and to get back to them with the case number. With that, they said, they would be able to take further action. So I filed a police report, waited for authorization, received a PDF of the report, and chatted back into Amazon. They then said the case number was not enough, and that they needed to verify the report with a URL. I told them my local police department does not issue URLs (their system doesn't even use URLs), so Amazon asked for the phone number of the station. They said the officer would not confirm the information on the police report with them, and therefore they could not take further action. I went through this process about 3 times, hoping the problem was just a lazy agent, but they said the same thing every time, that they needed to verify the police report either over the phone or with a URL.

So I called the police station and explained that they had my permission to share all of the details of the report with Amazon, because otherwise Amazon would not be able to help me, and I was told that under The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (I believe) they were not able to do so. So I requested a URL, and again they told me that there is no such thing as a URL for police reports. They said that all the information relating to the report, including its authorization, is on the PDF, and that I should send that to Amazon.

So I sent the PDF to Amazon. They told me to wait 2-3 days. 2-3 days later, no update. Then I called to ask about the status of the case, and was transferred to a department beyond the leadership team (I forget the name). They told me they would schedule a callback with me for 2 days from that time. 2 days later, no callback. So I called in, they apologized, and said I would be hearing from them in 2 more days. Once again, didn't hear back. After calling again, they said that the PDF is not sufficient to verify the police report, and by their policy they require a URL. I explained again that a URL does not exist, to which they basically told me I was SOL.

Furious, I chatted in about 10 more times, hoping to get connected to an agent with a sense of reason, but they all regurgitated the same line,

&gt;""If the issue isn't resolved after contacting local law enforcement and the carrier, please contact us with the URL to the online police report regarding this incident or a police report number regarding this incident and the name of the related police department. Without the police report, we're unable to take further action.  
Once we receive the police report , we will be able to take further action on your order. This will help us to discuss with the carrier about the delivery of the package.""

The only other response I've gotten is that once the order is handed off to the carriers, the responsibility of the delivery of the packages passes on from Amazon to the customer. I have given them everything they asked for, aside from that which does not exist, and exhausted all of my options. At this point, it feels like I'm speaking to help-bots rather than humans. I'm completely lost for action.

I'm a student. Now I can't pay my rent, and I've been borrowing money from my girlfriend just so I can eat. I'll have to drop out if this doesn't get resolved. My friends aren't going to pay me back for their packages that didn't arrive. Is there anything else I can do?",38,8,2019-02-28,ECOM,0.07237018644809723,0.9005815982818604,0.027048204094171524
