ecommerce,Is Magento any good? I've read some bad reviews but it seems like it's the most popular cart atm.,"The bad reviews mainly pointed out the expensive price-tag of the Enterprise edition (which I don't think I need anyways), but also the more worrisome issue of code breaking after Magento upgrades.

Does anyone have experience with Magento? 

Would you recommend it for a small-medium online retail site?

Thanks.",0,1,2011-03-07,ECOM,0.04531022161245346,0.9267281889915466,0.027961617335677147
