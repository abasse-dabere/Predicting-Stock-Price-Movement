ecommerce,How Do You Advertise Your Site Successfully | Edgy Couture,"Hey Everyone,
How do you advertise and drive traffic to your website and convert that traffic into sales? My site has been open for 3 months now and 95% of our sales come from Ebay and Amazon. 

I tried Facebook Ad's..I would spend $5-$40 for an ad, Facebook would say I am going to reach between 4k-7k people with my audience...then I would reach maybe 600 people if I was lucky and less than 12 would click on my site so I got no sales from it so I stopped using fb ads because it wasn't working.

I tried Instagram ad's, google ads, twitter ads all with the same result.

What am I doing wrong, do I need to hire an ad agency? Or is their something wrong with my website and I am just not seeing it?

dropship,Printful is not so great - thoughts?,"I know it's been said - this is just my experience thus far. 

Opened a new Shopify T-Shirt store 2 months ago, selling band merchandise - decided to go with Printful because it is easy / integrated well into Shopify and I gotta say... it's not that great. 

Half the orders are not making it to the destination and if they do it takes 20 days to get there - which in this world is unacceptable. Also - I would have to check on orders from weeks ago to ensure they arrived, no one would inform me or the customer. Printful does not handle this well. 

Printful will ask you to impose on the customer to ensure they added their info correctly - which is the case sometimes but not for the amount of orders that aren't delivered it can't always be the customer - sry just had to vent a bit -

woocommerce,Varnish page excludes are overridden,"Hi everyone,


To optimize my website (profpc.nl), my host suggested using varnish. Since I'm running WooCommerce I wanted to exclude pages like the cart and checkout.


My host says the pages are excluded, but are somehow overridden. This causes the first product to be added to the cart to not work.

ecommerce,"Best platform for ecommerce site, but also a content site?","I’m in the process of putting the final touches of a website design (using Sketch) and I’m looking for advice as to what platform I should look towards to launch it on and how to go about doing that.

**About the website:** The website will need ecommerce capabilities as I will be selling about 5 or so products on it. However, the website will be more of an organized content site, so having capabilities to host content is arguably more important than

The best example I can provide without giving it away is that my concept l be similar in nature https://www.chemicool.com/. My site has nothing to do with Chemicool and will by no means have anything to do with the periodic table / elements, but the Chemicool website is organized well in that it has a landing page for each element, and each element page is structured the same way and has the same template. My site will be a similar concept, with the addition of a small ecommerce store and a blog.

I’m not a software developer and I think I would need help building this, unless I can find a platform that would give me a WYSIWYG editor. Some platforms I’ve considered are Shopify, Wix, and WordPress/WooCommerce. I'm open to hiring someone on Upwork to get this launched.

Ideally, once the site is set up, I wouldn’t have to have a software developer touch it rather than the occasional bit of maintenance. My design isn’t overly complicated (it’s pretty darn minimal actually).

About me: My strengths are digital marketing (SEO, social media, and AdWords especially) and design (graphic design and illustration via Adobe Creative Cloud and Sketch). Again, I’m not a software developer, though I’ve closely worked with software developers the past decade.

ecommerce,Customer scan a barcode to add to cart for Shopify or magento (or other ecommerce)? Plus a bunch of other questions about business setup with ecommerce focus,"Hello all- i run a b2b company in a traditional industry and we are looking to move our technology forward. Currently we have a Magento 1.9 site for ecommerce ( we sell capital equipment, consumable supplies and parts as well as have a field service team). The capital equipment is mostly sold by our sales team but our website features the specification, videos pricing etc to help the sales process.  We have quickbooks for accounting, and a stand alone CRM database that we use the mosts for scheduling our field service team and our sales people do a bit of finding names and making storing quotes sent etc. 

Our challenges:
-All systems are disconnected resulting in duplicate entries in many places
-We have 2 warehouses and 8 field service technicians that have parts and products with them 
- we want to grow our supplies selling business and feel if we made it easier for customers to re-order in a technologically efficient manner we could gain business and provide a barrier to switching

Some of our thoughts-

Is there an extension or app available for Shopify/magento/Bigcommerce to have a customer scan a barcode and add an item to their cart?

Is there a good field service scheduling software that can integrate well with an ecommerce store front? Like zendesk but with field service and not just help desk? Our thought is we could essentially use a mobile POS to have technicians select the parts they used, the labour etc and bill a customer through the ecommerce solution - where can we manage the warranties, service history, planned manitenance etc?

Inventory management- with 2 warehouses and 8 technicians we are moving inventory around to satisfy customer needs ... recommended way to do this?

CRM- our sales team Is small and we want to do better with our ability to send follow up emails with automation ( from a sales team member) so customers get a drip from their rep based on “ its been a while since you ordered x, here is a promo code to try...” i think this is available with most ecommerce back ends wonder what your experience is with these....

The last piece is cost, I understand we are not looking for a free solution but I am interest in not having massive legacy costs to carry this solution forward.

ecommerce,"Want to improve your conversion rates? Here are some no-strings, simple copywriting tips that'll do exactly that.","Hey r/ecommerce - professional copywriter here.



Your images are big and beautiful. Your shipping is free. Your returns policy is so chill you could store your beers in it. So why the #?@!$ aren’t people buying from your store??



The problem might be your copy. 



“But my copy is great! I’m a fantastic writer!”


I’m sure you are a fantastic writer, but fantastic writers don’t always make fantastic copywriters. Your copy might well be typo-free and coherently written, but does it sell your product? Does it help to define your brand? Is it building that trust? If your conversions are poor, it’s highly likely that the answer is “no” to all three of those questions.



It doesn’t have to be that way. Here are 3 simple tips that will change your copywriting game forever. The best thing? You can start using them right now.


__________________________________________________________________________


**Tip #1) Be aware of “yeah yeah” phrases.**



What the hell is a “yeah yeah” phrase? It’s a phrase that makes the reader say “yeah yeah” - as in “yeah yeah, I’ve heard all of this before” or “yeah yeah, that’s what they all say, brosef”. I would estimate that 70% of online stores are full of them. 


Here’s an example of a few sentences filled with “yeah yeah” phrases.


*”Loftus Shoes are purveyors of the finest footwear the internet has to offer. We’ve redefined the shoe industry with a combination of the latest styles, cutting edge durability and affordable pricing, meaning all you have to worry about is the accompanying outfit.*”


So if you spend any time shopping online, you’ve definitely read a paragraph like this before. “Finest the internet has to offer”, “redefined the industry”, “latest styles”, “cutting edge” - these are all classic “yeah yeah” phrases. What does “latest styles” actually mean? Have you *really* redefined the industry? These phrases are all guaranteed to have your audience muttering “yeah yeah” to themselves faster than you can say “market leaders”. 


By getting rid of these phrases, we can create a much more compelling read:


“*Loftus Shoes are designed for those who refuse to follow in the footsteps of others. We’re the only manufacturer to cut our leather geometrically, giving your shoe a unique durability. Welcome to style that’s built to last. It’s time to walk your own path.*”


There are three very important things I’ve changed here. 



Firstly, I’ve eliminated the “yeah yeah” phrases. I’m not saying I sell *the best* shoes on earth. I’m not saying I’ve turned the industry on its head either. *Anyone* can say those things; they’re probably at best mistaken or at worst flat out lying. Instead, I’m focusing on my USP in simple and hyperbole-free terms. The result is something believable and trustworthy. 


**(HINT: To find “yeah yeah” phrases, start by looking for any word that has “est” at the end. Best? Finest? Comfiest? They’re probably not adding anything. Remember, if you’re struggling to find the right words, keep it simple and to-the-point. More on that later.)**


Secondly, it speaks to a defined audience. The first paragraph gave us no indication as to who we might be trying to speak to. Parents? Pensioners? Teenagers? It’s hard to say. The 2nd paragraph, however, has a very clear voice. “It’s time to walk your own path” isn’t the kind of thing we’d say if we were targeting the over 60’s. Our target audience is probably relatively young, trendy, but sensible enough to value quality as well as style. 


**(HINT: wondering who your target audience are? Look in the mirror. You’re probably who you want to sell to.)**


Thirdly, we’ve spoken about the customer, not ourselves. Let’s focus more on this concept.

________________________________________________________________________

**Tip #2) Talk about the customer, not about you.**

Consumers love to hear about themselves. We all do really, it’s in our nature. Yet so many stores fail to realise this. Heed my words: if you want your visitor to pay attention, talk about them, not about you. 


The example above illustrates this well, but let’s use another one for good measure. Here’s how a product description might read if the writer has forgotten about the audience:


“*Our t-shirts are made from 100% cotton for guaranteed comfort. We offer free shipping on all orders over $20, and have a no-questions-asked returns policy. Why not give us a try?*”


It’s fine, but it’s far too self indulgent. How could it read if we focused on the reader instead?


“*You deserve a t-shirt that feels as good as it looks, which is why all of our apparel is made from 100% cotton. We’ll give you free shipping on any order over $20, and the freedom to return your product if you don’t love it as much as we do.*”


There’s something far more appealing about copy that uses “you” and “your” instead of “we” and “our”. It’s a subtle change, but it makes a huge difference. 

**Always look for opportunities to talk about your audience. Just imagine you’re on a date with them: your goal is to avoid talking about yourself too much, even if you’re awesome (I’m sure you are).**

______________________________________________________________________



**Tip #3 - try a fat free diet.**


You’re starting to look chubby, dude. 



Nah but seriously, I don’t mean you - I mean your writing. Drop a few dress sizes and trim your copy. It needs to be proverbial and elegant. Concise. Punchy. You get the idea. That’s because you only have a small amount of time to speak to the weary internet traveller, so you have to make it count. 



This rule is most relevant to your title text. Make sure it’s clear, simple and to-the-point. Don’t beat around the bush. Don’t be too clever. Are your t-shirts super comfortable? “Really comfy t-shirts.” would be a perfectly adequate title. “T-shirts that make you feel good” would also be great. I haven’t been inventive or creative here - there’s no riddle or pun or double entendre. But it works. **Telling it how it is always works.**



**DISCLAIMER**: your copy doesn’t *always* have to be concise. The deeper into the site you go, the more flourishes you can give your writing. An “About Us” that tells a compelling story or a product description that weaves a sense of wonder and excitement are welcome and encouraged. Just make sure you stay true to your brand.

woocommerce,McAfee causing webshop to freeze on payments,"Hi all,

So, I asked for a solution arround r/wordpress regarding the payment page to stop loading the options. I didn't manage to make it work or replicate it myself so I visited one of the clients where who had this issue. Here are my findings:

First of all, I checked whether the problem still occured and it did. The payment options where checking something and it immediately stopped loading causing the payment options to grey out. I then logged in to the WiFi the computer was connected to with another laptop to see if i could replicate it. I couldn't so I advanced to the next step; disabling McAfee with MSCONFIG. There were 5 processes (!). I rebooted and tried again and the webshop worked like a charm. On a couple of other devices, (iPad and and a iPhone) also connected through that particular WiFi, also had the same problem with they payment options being greyed out. The webshop now also worked on those devices.

Now when I wanted to enable McAfee again there were only 3 processes available to enable at this point, which is odd. After enabling these 3 processes the webshop still worked.

This is strange isn't it? The webshop now works like a charm on all browsers tested. It's like McAfee was putting out a command to the modem causing specific processes to crash. The fact that only 3/5 processes where available after the reboot makes me believe that at some point, McAfee had a problem with this, but they later resolved the issue although not being able to remove certain parts of this in an update without being completely disabled.

What are your thoughts on this?

I want to add a bit of a gamification aspect to our shopify ecommerce site, and to help engage coffee enthusiasts with our brand and our love of good coffee.

Ideally they'd be able to save their comments about the beans but i think that aspect is further down the road. I'm hoping it would end up functioning something like these scratch maps (https://www.scratchmap.org/product/scratch-map-deluxe-edition/). When a customer tries all coffee producing areas in a country, or all coffee-producing countries in an area (say coffee from all African coffee-producing nations), they'd get some sort of kick-back like a discount, free bag of beans, etc. Has anyone come across some sort of plug-in along these lines?

ecommerce,Help choosing online purchasing solution,"My wife has a catering business, and I'm trying to find the best way to let people purchase through our website.  I have been doing the free trials of shopify and BigCommerce but I feel like our exact need isn't directly addressed through those, or else I just suck at finding a way to make it work.

Basically, it's food deliveries.  My wife runs these dinner &amp; soup ""clubs"".  For a span of time she offers good stuff, thats either pickup or delivery (not shipping, physical delivery since this is all local).  There can also be a few options for what someone can order.

The 2 sites I've been trying don't seem to favor such a system as far as I can tell.  For example, there's 2 sizes of the food.  Single or family servings.  Then you can get it delivered or picked up, and there may be additional sides to get (like salads, etc).  

Up until now, I've just made paypal buttons accommodating the various options, and it honestly doesn't really look very good, and can be confusing.  But, we do all payment processing through PayPal, this cannot change.  

We have our own website &amp; domain already established, and I know these services offer you that.  I imagine it would be best to just make it the ""store"" page when someone has investigated the options screen kind of thing.  It would lead to Shopify's brand store I've made and have the options there.

So I'm asking what I should be doing.  Are Shopify/BigCommerce the way to go?  I don't think I want WordPress/Squarespace or the like, since we already have a site.  The ability to have coupon codes is also a must, but I suppose that seems standard.",10,3,2018-03-10,ECOM,0.019919784739613533,0.9314902424812317,0.048589929938316345

We decided after a few phone calls to set up our own store, so we did. Within a week it was launched and we got straight to advertising on instagram.

Domain/e-mail/SSL - $20
Shopify - $30
Advertisements (so far, one days worth of advertisement)  $19

- We'd like an intergrated newsletter of some kind;

I'm wrapping my head around the adding to cart functionality within woocommerce and was wondering if anyone has any must-have plugins or features they like using?

ecommerce,Drop shipping Tariffs &amp; laws for Egyptian cotton bed sheets.,"Hey Guys, Greetings from Egypt. I really admire this community, and  it’s resourcefulness, and how its bold and energetic. 

I want to start drop shipping but, I’m currently in Egypt. My product is 100% Premium Egyptian cotton bed sheets, and I want to export it. Other than that I live thousands of miles from any of my desired markets. I have some setbacks; I’m really not good with marketing or web development. In addition I want to determine the tariff rate for my product and if there is any obstacle in entering the market. 

Anybody knows where can I know the tariff rate and whether my product can enter the US or not? Plus should I go and try to develop my own online store or should I just be a supplier? How can I find someone who will drop ship by merchandise?

shopify,PSA: Dont be me,"So, I soft launched my first store on Shopify after getting a temp ban on eBay where I do most of my sales. I took the time away from eBay to look at what I was selling, purchased samples of new stuff and restock. I also started in on a new Shopify store, logo etc. Built out product descriptions, became a dealer for some new stuff and added a few key plugins based on research on this thread. 

Started things up with Bing and Bidvertiser PPC ads using some free credits I had, and some funds I put in. Traffic was great. I was seeing most people coming in from the ad campaigns browsing multiple items and a lot being added to carts, but no sales. 

After a couple weeks, I managed my first sale this past weekend after being listed on a deal site that caters to my niche. There was a slow, but steady stream of targeted visitors coming through and I one guy checked out a couple items via Amazon pay. I saw a lot more folks putting stuff in carts, but didn't close the deal on anything else. 

One user emailed me saying that she tried multiple cards and each one was declined . I asked her for some details and we had a running email thread while I started poking around. 

So, long story short, I had left my payment processor in test mode, so nobody could check out unless they used PayPal or Amazon Pay. Really feel like an idiot here and wasted two weeks of free marketing funds and over 40 potential sales. :(

EBay ban is being lifted this weekend and I have a bunch of stuff scheduled to be listed. I'll use that marketplace to promote the new store as I do keep prices lower on Shopify. 

Just wanted to pass on my forehead slapping moment. I guess it's onward and upward from here.",4,2,2018-03-13,ECOM,0.055688679218292236,0.9068619608879089,0.03744934871792793

Nevertheless I like to know what I need to do so I don't get into any legal trouble or tax problems. I'm from the US btw. So far what I found is:

2. File for EIN     
3. Create business structure. (I'm thinking of going sole propriety until I make my first $1k. Otherwise I'm seeing myself taking a  loss and just doing this for the experience.

ecommerce,Can someone help me find my perfect e-commerce-system?,"Hello,

I plan starting an e-commerce-business. And now I need to select a shopsystem. It would be really nice, if someone could help me here.

So, we don't start with a lot of money and as such, big shopsystems with huge licensing costs fall away for us. I have the experience to create websites and I also want to create this website by myself as much as possible. So, the shopsystem should be highly customizable. Maybe with different actions that can be triggered when things happen. I know that individuality is very important and I am also very interested in User Experience, so I would like to be able to customize every single bit of the website, in terms of design and user flows.

Another important thing is the law. I first want to concentrate on the german-language market. So, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The shop will be stationed in Austria, so this law has to be supported.
But we also want to expand internationally eventually. It's important to us, that this expansion is made easy, so we don't have to change many things, to process orders internationally, if that's possible.

I don't know what is already possible and if it's important for the beginning, but maybe there are some automation systems for accounting or logistics.

Last but not least an easy integration of different payment types, like PayPal, Sofort, EPS and so on.

We don't hesistate to pay something of course.

**TLDR;** To sum things up:

* Can cost something, but not the world
* Should be highly customizable
* ""Compatible"" with Austrian law
* (Easy) Possibility to expand internationally
* Connects with accounting/logistics system (Maybe you can also recommend software for these)
* Integration of many different payment types

Ebay fee: 10%
PayPal: 2-3% 

Unless your dropshipping small items it just won't work. The fees from higher priced items will take any profit you'd be making, for example if I find something for $350 on Amazon and put it on ebay for $400.

ecommerce,"Very Niche, But Needed... site feedback on branding","Recently I've launched my site, an idea yet to be accomplished as I am slowly building this into what my mission is. Mainly its funds that can't get me to wanting the products I'd like to have, but I have to start somewhere....
I've always heard good businesses fill gaps and problems, here's my stab at one. Animal Cruelty Free (vegan/natural) based hygiene &amp; personal products shipped monthly box subscription.

[veganadult.com](http://veganadult.com)

2 problems I personally had: brick mortar shopping for cruelty free deodarant/condoms/shampoo (not vegan, but ""humane"") and friends I know often have rashes to non 'natural' feminine products. All of these are usually forgotten when out shopping or ""suddenly ran out"" etc and can be a pain to find a consistent brand and store that carries these particular products. I felt this way with razors too til dollarshaveclub. So double niche of natural personal products meets monthly subscription.

In the long run, I'd like to switch to a name that inconspicuous but I understand domain names that are vague can help with search engines. I've actually bought a few and redirected them all to my main. All media content is original or press media kit. I've started a Twitter/Instagram/FB/YouTube - all with (sadly but true) lacking content at a weekly rate. I've used Instagram before and intend on using it for my main social outlet as I've seen it drive my previous ventures much traffic. I feel that content is king when it comes to resellers and I'm aware that is what I am here... are sites like fiverr advisable places to find people to create original content for me such as blog articles about my products? Anyone with experience in this? or even posting on my media outlets?

I get overwhelmed by the amount of ideas of content I want to put out (blog articles, yt promo vids, media for social)... what should I prioritize? What are good apps to help me with this juggle? I have 2 different types of products now; I really want to branch out into a few more. Current brands I carry sell these other products; whats the best way to start a relationship with these brands to ask for wholesale?.. simple email? What is my site missing/lacking?

I've gone to instagram in hopes of finding some niche inspiration. I investigate as many sponsored ads as I come across and began to notice some (more like just 2 I've seen) have a sort of subscription perk. For example, ''Bootaybag'' has a 13$ subscription to receive 2 panties every month and customers can have some control of what they will get in their bag every month (no thongs, thongs, mixed). Their products come in a little brown bag pouch (commonly seen with coffee scrubs/some detox products that you find on IG). The other I saw was ""Luxypurse"" which they have a 40$ subscription that sends the customer a designer bag (worth $150+) every month and are currently having a contest to be eligible to win a free Gucci bag every month.

The subscription concept is actually very interesting, but, how would these work?? Do these companies just purchase in bulk and send them out themselves?",2,6,2018-03-17,ECOM,0.018222201615571976,0.9177653193473816,0.06401249021291733

ecommerce,How Harry’s Engage Subscribers and Increase Their Average Order Value (AOV) Using “The CPS Method”,"Hey Reddit!

My friend Sam recently spent a month reverse-engineering Harry's marketing entire marketing strategy and today, I want to share with you how they’re using email marketing to convert prospects into buyers.

If you’re not familiar, Harry’s are one of the fastest-growing venture-backed startups in the world (in fact, they recently raised $112 million to move beyond shaving)

Here’s the deal:

Harry’s relies on a handful of proven emails to fuel their sales engine. I identified three recurring types of email, each with a specific goal. I call Harry’s approach to email marketing “The CPS Method”:  

The three types of email focus on:

* Cart recovery (with a twist)
* Product praise 
* Stealth promotion

**Email #1: Cart Recovery (With a Twist)**

Like many e-commerce companies, Harry’s know the importance of sending recovery emails to close abandoning shoppers.

In fact, while researching for this article, I went through their checkout only to leave before buying (found out why in the bonus strategy).

A few days later, I received an abandoned cart email as expected: https://i.imgur.com/lEzfs1f.png



Nothing new here. That is until I scrolled down… https://i.imgur.com/gQYGzyk.png



Harry’s offer a downsell to on-the-fence buyers. Why? Because they know they intrigued the user (after all, they got as far checking out). But they also know something prevented them from moving forward. 

Maybe it was the pricing. Or maybe, most likely, it was an objection to having to commit up-front. The downsell raises—and overcomes—their top objection and assures users there are no up-front commitments.

But there’s something else going on here...

The Turmen Set is a $15 downsell. But when you go to checkout, there’s an opportunity for Harry’s to upsell you to a higher price point: https://i.imgur.com/ONiYr52.png



The downsell masquerades as an upsell.

Expanding on this, let’s look at some rough numbers:

A Shaving Plan subscription is $3 on the front end with the option to upsell to $15 or $21 during checking. This gives Harry’s a total of either $18 or $24 per customer after 30 days. (This is an oversimplification as there are many variables influencing customer lifetime value such as delivery frequency, upgrading, and downgrading, etc.)
A Turmen Set is a one-off payment of $15 on the front end with the option to upsell for $5 or $15 during checking. This gives Harry’s a total of either $20 or $30 per customer (with the potential to convert that customers into a monthly subscription customer down the line).

Offering a downsell doesn’t only give Harry’s extra cash flow to offset against ad spends and customer acquisition costs (CAC). It also allows them to get a foot-in-the-door with potential subscription customers. Not everyone is ready to become a subscription customer, which, as you’ll see with Email #3, isn’t always the goal.

The takeaway?

Use abandoned cart emails to recover revenue, of course, but go one step further. Offer a downsell to anyone who might need further coaxing to buy from you. A good downsell acts as more than a tripwire; it’s also a hidden opportunity to upsell on the front or backend.

**Email #2: Product Praise**

Harry’s rarely sell their products in their emails. Instead, they have their customers sell for them.

Check out this recent email promoting their Face Wash: https://i.imgur.com/edbM1DG.png

  

Note the wording here. This isn’t a generic testimonial (“I love Harry’s Face Wash”); it’s a humorous confession of an advocate’s undying devotion to their favorite brand.

Building on the above, Harry’s then uses compelling copy to create a “mental movie” for what it’s like using their product: https://i.imgur.com/T4q5spN.png



Using sensory adjectives and future-pacing, Harry’s walk the reader through the experience of using their product, from beginning to end, before following up with a clear call-to-action to buy.

If that isn’t good advertising, I don’t know what is. 

The takeaway?

Using compelling copy to get people to buy is good. But using customer testimonials who sell your products and services for you is even better.

ProTip. Use humor if possible. The funnier and more memorable the customer’s quote, the more likely it is to “stick” in the reader’s mind—and convince them to buy from you.

**Email #3: Stealth Promotion** 

Like many e-commerce stores, Harry’s often taken advantage of various holiday periods to engage readers—and drive more sales.

Take a look at the following email promoting around Father’s Day: https://i.imgur.com/xjQblSY.png



On the surface, it looks like a normal content promotion email, right? I thought so, too. That is until I clicked-through to the content and began scrolling through their content...

Halfway down the page, Harry’s invited me to buy a box set, not for myself—for my dad. https://i.imgur.com/fioJ6Zq.png



It’s subtle and completely under the radar—but it works like gangbusters. 

Here’s why:

1. It “anchors” a positive emotion to their product. Anchoring describes our tendency to rely too much on the first piece of information offered (the “anchor”) when making decisions. If you’re invited to think about your father, it’s likely to influence your decision if you’re asked to buy one of their products (especially if it’s for him).
1. Its messaging is consistent throughout. Rather than direct users to their usual store page, Harry’s created a dedicated sales page with father-focused copy to move buyers to action (pictured below). They even changed the product itself to reflect the promotion, offering a new color. Now that’s dedication. 
https://i.imgur.com/8YYAU3o.png

   

So, here’s what I want to leave you with:

Content isn’t only for generating traffic and building links—it’s also a selling tool. Be warned, though: it’s hard to get right. Not everyone is ready to buy, remember. But if a prospect is ready, it’s a killer strategy for selling without selling.

ProTip. Schedule it to coincide with a national holiday or celebration (like above) and make your offer appeal to the buyer’s family rather than the buy themselves.

ecommerce,Online Store Traffic Sources,"Hi all,

Last night I took a look into my analytics to analyse the 5 traffic sources which provide me with visitors: Social, direct, search, e-mail and unknown.

By far, the best source of visitors is social (doubling direct, which comes in second), which makes sense as that's where most of my marketing budget goes. However, looking at the sales by traffic source, the largest source of sales comes from direct visitors (doubling my search visitors, which comes in second AND THEN in third place is social).

Diving into $ generated per visitor for each source, by far the best are search and direct which both average around $3 per visitor whereas social gives me around $0.60 per visitor.

This is quite confusing as I don't focus any, if at all, of my budget towards direct and search visitors and quite honestly I do not know how/why people directly or search for my store when I market quite predominately on social media.

One hypothesis I have for this is customers first visit my store via my social media accounts, which gives them the initial awareness and some time passes and they directly enter or search for my store to make a purchase, however I'm not sure how to test this.

Should I spend most of my money on direct and search visitors as that's where I experience the highest ROI (and how would I do that) or is my above hypothesis true and I should keep spending money on social media marketing?

Does anyone have any tips or any sort of experience with this?

woocommerce,Use HTTPS on whole site or just checkout?,"I have an SSL cert and have HTTPS enabled on only the checkout/my account, etc page. Should my whole ecommerce site have HTTPS enabled?    I ask because when you visit my main page, it says in the address bar right before the URL  ""Not Secure""  That may scare away some people from an ecommerce site.  I'm not sure, as the https comes in to play when you make it to the checkout or at the my account page.

dropship,"My Dropshipping experience, 10K in 2 months","New here. Excuse my poor writing skills.

I recently jumped on the dropshipping bandwagon, I built a mens gadget type product store. I want to share my experience so far and hopefully get some pointers on how to improve my site and increase sales. 

like most, I watched a bunch of youtube videos on how to dropship products from aliexpress. I had prior knowledge of shopify, so building a site and installing apps was simple enough. I had no facebook ad knowledge, so many hours of videos and articles have been consumed at this point. I soon learnt that learning facebook advertising is the single most important skill you can have if you are running an internet business. They're awesome! 

I used the free plus shipping tactic at first, which seems to alienate a lot of people, but equally produces results from those who do not think it's a scam. I resorted to (product + free shipping), which works just as well. If someone want's the product, they will buy it, regardless of gimmicks, and negative comments were reduced by 100%.
I sold one product consistently for 2 months, being careful not to exhaust my audiences, and to expand interests etc. One day, my sales just declined, My conversion rate dropped from 9-10% down to 1-2% which meant It was costing me money. Last night I launched a new ad targeting the same interests that have worked for me, with a different age range that I have not used at all. I had 2 sales within minutes of me launching the ads. Which was reminiscent of my earlier campaigns. After that, Nothing at all for two days up until now.

My CTR is still high, but no purchases. Have I exhausted a 200 Million people demographic. Or is there something else going on here? 

I have no idea what product to sell next! I have tried a couple of different products with varying success, none of them produced returns worth perusing further.

ecommerce,How i made internet businesses 34m in 2017,"Hi folks, going to post this every 1-2 weeks with edits, addons etc because I’ve had a lot of good feedback, Thankyou!

I started marketing several years ago when i began my first Yoga 'Internet business', i realised very quickly that the difference between 10 dozen identical products was the reach. So i began by offering 25% discounts on my yoga products for tweeting/posting a referral link to my website and giving positive feedback. 2 weeks later my site crashed from the surplus of traffic, i ran out of stock and i put things in perspective and decided to make marketing my business model.

**Brand awareness**

I used my own business as a platform of experimenation for my ideas, i put my business @'s across all my products, i shipped them out to every internet yoga star from the trending pages of social analysis sites. I spent thousands on social media analysis, i rebranded all my products to red, i stuck state names across all of them and then bought facebook groups and put ads across state yoga groups. Here's an example data set https://imgur.com/gallery/7OHIx

**Pride consumers**

Then to reflect this success, i ran a similiar campaign for one of my clients, and we used the pride of state consumers to grow his shoe business. I researched the best colours to use for different states and gave him a list, we put the state names across his shoes and marketed directly to the states through instagram influencers.
&gt; Here's an example report from one of my clients - https://prnt.sc/iisqv8 

**Value**

I work with a lot of musicians, a big part of them started with low view audio only videos. I learnt quickly that for them to achieve success they had to provide value, so i told them to create videos. They did and then ta-da, they had 4500 views when they only had 200 view music videos before. 
&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsuGPy7vrEc

**Trend riding**

Make use of trends in your business, even Pornhub does this. If Fortnite is so big, why ignore it? It's working for someone, one of the musicians i work with, i told him to make a Fortnite music video. And he did and got 490k views, when before he was lucky to get 10% of that. I made use of the political trends in the American election with trump AND hillary brands on some of my clients products, with the pro trump and pro hillary supports wanting to sport their political beliefs no matter the cost. 

I see a lot of website based businesses underuse social media with broad attempts at ~~Facebook ads~~ and ~~Instagram ads~~, ill go to digital marketing agencies and see they either have no social following or a huge botted one. It's a terrible idea to buy followers, if you want to cut corners then you should look at buying a smaller business with a bigger social following. 

Here’s the impressions from a tweet I made on the *first day* of creating a company a twitter platform and using trend riding and collaboration to grow it https://prnt.sc/huziu6 4K Impressions on one tweet in 15 minutes - we hit 80k impressions in the first day. I did this from simply mimiking the formula for success from a similiar company account, i don't want to try change the magic formula for success. 

**Direction**


* It’s better to get one click from a Facebook group dedicated to shoes than it is to get 100 clicks to a Facebook group dedicated to Tree’s for a shoe store. It will be cheaper and about 5000% more efficient. You would lose money on the tree group. That's a rough proverb for why you shouldn't just buy facebook or instagram, youtube ads without putting in a similiar level of funding towards targetting and direction.

* I target groups through other groups. You can target parents through niche’s like Barbecue’s where the average participant is an affluent parent, you can target students through games or shoe groups where your average consumers are affluent students.

**Keep in touch**

You really do have to stay in touch with your business to know what's working and what isn't, companies like Toys R Us refused to do that and stuck with huge stockpiles of star wars toys and then they collapsed. Blockbusters where ahead of the curve for digital movies and then they refused to change, Netflix changed and Netflix won. Amazon learnt to use online selling and left companies like Tescos with financial crisis. 

&gt;The big boom in marketing that I’ve seen is social media marketing, marketers can create huge social following for companies and use that platform to sell content for extremely low costs in comparison to the tens of thousands it costs to use other platforms such as radio. Social media marketing has become somewhat controversial, but it is important to always stay open minded. 

**Collaboration** &amp; **Viral content**

I can not stress the importance of working with other people. Every billionaire i know of has had a mentor, every big company success story had business partners. I've had far more success in clients who have listened to me and done collaborative work with digital celebs, with a dog product business making thousands of sales when they worked with vlogger Zoella and gave her free products. 

Viral content is very important because every Youtuber with over 1 million subscribers has started off big and managed to keep it big, nobody grinded and slowly rose up at an equal exponent. Hard work is fine but being consistent and mixing it up, copying the viral content of others is an easy way of bringing in secondary viewership and traffic. Pewdiepie, the biggest youtuber on the planet, started with viral horror content. Ninja, the biggest streamer, grinded for 7 years but only truly struck gold with the virality of Fortnite. So it makes sense to repeat their methods.

**Key words**

It is an obvious thing to say but it's neglected, key words are very important. I had a crypto business come to me and ask why their site wasnt doing very well, and i looked through it and saw they never mentioned anything beyond bitcoin. Bitcoin is a very expensive key word to market, with costs of the raw word being as high as 38$ per click. I had to bring them down to earth with harsh truths, i rewrote their entire site using SEM tools in mind - with key words and phrases like ""Altcoin exchange"" and using the names of the top 100 altcoins across the site. 

**So what do I do?**

* Well first i’ll assess the clients social following and website rankings /optimisation. Then I’ll build a list of keywords to target based on simple research using my programs, and I’ll take over/create the business/website account on social media’s.
* Then I’ll buy media/art for the accounts, I’ll look at other accounts in the same target market and consult the business owner on their own agendas or themes. 


&gt; Social media with art has significantly better engagement and follow statistics. It’s cheaper to buy art than it is not to! 

* Now we engage our target audiences posts and the active users often respond with reciprocation and your platform grows. We do this all automatically, but I’ll manage and execute the whole thing myself and subcontract anything I want to push.
Now we monetise. 

* I contact PR teams and content creators on various platforms about hosting their related content on the account in return for an upfront charge and an affiliate fee. This is influencing, i'll often get people to it for free meaning we get a lot of impressions and actual feedback

What i want to know is what would be the best way to start?

Firstly i wanted to open a store that would only be oriented in my own country, no shipping outside. I found dropshipping company -  BestBuy, but after checking up with some products and their postages, which was between 8-9€ to my country, i cannot see my products selling, since normally when you order from things from stores in my country, postage is like 2-3€. Also probably a lot less people to target here.

So i was thinking of finding a niche that would actually sell, but then i thought what would be the best way to sell and advertise them? 

- Can i open up an aliexpress/amazon/ebay shop and sell products via dropshipping there
- or shoud i create my webstore on shopify and link it to oberlo.

What do you think could bring me more success?

I would also like to know how much to invest into advertising? Since i really do not have a lot money to start from, i cannot put 500+€ into ads and also monthly shopify and oberlo payments while also paying monthly for a registered company under my name, which would all in total come to like 1000€ a month...and yeh, i don't have that kind of money to start with...

Any suggestions?

ecommerce,Shopify + AliExpress: Can You Build a Long-Term Business?,"Hi guys,

a lot of people start out with the Shopify + AliExpress / Oberlo model, but is it possible to build a successful long-term business with this model?

My main concerns are:

1) Long Shipping Times
- By default, it takes 7-10 days for items to arrive in US (longer for the rest of the world). Why would someone buy from your store if they can get the same item from Amazon in 1 day with zero shipping cost?
- It's a common issue, even among best rated sellers, that they don't use ePacket but China Post, even if you specifically instruct them to use ePacket. That can create some serious customer support issues.

2) Customs Duty
- If I as a customer would buy something and then get a form to fill out and customs duty to pay that would be a very unwelcome surprise. I would go through the trouble, probably, but I would never again order at from that seller.

3) Building a Relationship
- Nowadays you often don't buy directly from the manufacturer but from a re-seller. If you're stuck with a reseller, it's impossible to build a good relationship for the long-term (packaging, lower prices, etc.).

 

4) Quality Issues
- A lot of cheap products are made for Chinese market only and they don't comply with EU/US safety standards. That could cause a lot of troubles in the long-term.

What do you guys think? Is it worth doing the Shopify + AliExpress model, if you plan things for the long-trem, or is it better to skip the whole thing and find quality dropshippers in US/EU?

I've used 'scarcity' and all of the youtuber tips before but I'm unsure to how effective they actually are.

Still, I'm not sure how much to order, especially considering most of the designs have variations so I would need to order those as well.

Incentivize an inactive customer with an email to return to your website and purchase. Offering free shipping or a small discount like 10% off works great.

ecommerce,Platform for equipment rental service?,"Hi All,

I posted this to r/smallbusiness yesterday but didn't get much of a response, maybe this is a better place. 

I'm looking to launch a rental service for a specific type of sports equipment. It would require a web interface where customers can select their equipment, some additional add-ons (e.g. optional insurance) and then a payment processor. This basic functionality would be possible via popular add-ons for Shopify (BookThatApp) and SquareSpace (Booqable), for example.

The difficulty is that I want to offer two types of rental service: (1) A 'free date selection', where customers can select the equipment they want and manually select the dates they want to hire for, and (2) an 'events' system, where customers hire the equipment for specific events (in this case, sports competitions), and thus the dates and prices are fixed. I played around with both of the above systems and can't find an easy way to handle this which would also allow for stock keeping, etc.

Does anyone have a suggestion or recommendation of how this could be achieved? I have a background in programming and could develop this myself, but want to avoid re-inventing the wheel as much as possible.

We sell produce at per kilogram prices, but the weight can vary slightly transaction to transaction. For example, item a cost $20 per kilo, if 3 customers ordered 2 kilograms each from us, customer 1 might get 2.1kg, customer 2 might get 2kg and customer 3 might get 1.9kg. So we need some flexibility in our charging to accommodate this.

We would be very upfront with our customers that this is how it works, and in fact already do this in a manual way via email at the moment. People don't mind as they understand this is how it works.

Can we do this with Shopify?",0,2,2018-03-30,ECOM,0.04427696019411087,0.8978500962257385,0.057872943580150604

We have a specfic qty of each laptop and PC. We want the ability to customize each unit with an amount of RAM/Hard drive. If I add the variants ( multiple combinations of sizes of RAM with multiple hard drive sizes) into Shopify and let it manage the inventory, it makes me put a spefic amount of laptops for each variant.

shopify,I send my abandoned carts a flyer with 50% off. My conversion rates are ridiculous. Anyone interested in this?,"About a year ago, I had a ton of abandoned carts on my site and my email marketing efforts sucked. So I decided to experiment with something - anyone that abandoned cart, I'd actually mail them a flyer of the product they abandoned with a 50% off discount. Since then, I've been able to bring back over 25% of my cart abandoners.

I've now turned that into an app that automatically does it - am thinking of monetizing it, but wanted to gauge interest. Anyone here interested in using something like this? The app does everything - upload a design, it finds a printer near the customer so it's super cheap to ship and delivers it from there. You don't have to do anything besides the design (which I can do as well, if you want).

If you're interested, please let me know :-)",14,13,2018-03-31,ECOM,0.02531365305185318,0.923073947429657,0.05161243677139282
ecommerce,"Shopify shipping question - How can I have US shopper orders fulfilled by Amazon, but everyone else's by Manual fulfillment?","Hello!

So my situation is, I have products in Amazon US (FBA) but also have products in Asia, where I live. I want shoppers form the US to have orders fulfilled by Amazon, and shoppers in any other location in the world, to be fulfilled by me personally. 

Also, to make it more complicated, I have select products in Asia (and not in Amazon US) that I want US shoppers to still be able to purchase via manual fulfillment, same as other countries. 

Is anyone doing something similar? Would love to any suggestions or advice. Thanks!",12,4,2018-03-31,ECOM,0.017523249611258507,0.9207389950752258,0.061737753450870514

It can involve traveling and making your own schedule. It has nothing to do with internet marketing or blogging or anything like that.  

But what I am wondering is the best way to get it out there once it is finished being written? Leadpages? Clickfunnels? Shopify site? Looking for affiliates?

Also I am wondering what is a good price for stuff like this? This is definitely not something I want to price cheap because it is 100% honest and good info for someone interested in something like this but at the same time I do want to make sales so I do not want to price it too high.
