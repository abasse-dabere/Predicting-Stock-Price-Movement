ecommerce,2 fulfilment locations and shipping calculations,"Hey guys,

This an age old question I know. 

I fulfill out of one warehouse it’s a B2B setting. I want to start using a supplier that produces remanufactured versions of one of my product categories.  This category also serves B2C customers as well. The stock is too vast to hold myself so we have agreed to a drop shipping arrangement. 

My obvious issue is mixed orders.  I have a couple options:
-  List them all in one store and eat the shipping costs cause by mixed orders creating 2 small orders. 
-  List them on sister sites to keep orders together and charge appropriate shipping. 

The first still allows me to at least profit a bit, I was thinking of offering a free gift or extra percentage off for large orders to encourage people order more, less often saving me on shipping costs.  

The second solves my problem, but this just adds confusion right? Why market two sites when one would suffice?

I should mention the site already has a B2C front end and B2B account with a different pricing structure.  

How have you dealt with this in the last?

If you first run an engagement ad for social proof for a product and the numbers are good ($0.01 -$0.02 CPE), do you move to a conversion ad if you achieve no sales while running an engagement ad ?

when you go for a conversion ad what would your preference be a ATC conversion ad or checkout one?

and for the pixel to optimize perfectly for the audience and start selling properly, is a $5 daily budget over the period of 7 days for an audience of 10 million people a good idea, or you prefer running conversion ads with a narrowed audience?

This is my second time trying to get an e-commerce store of the ground, this time way more serious than my last time.

It's Traffic X Conversion Rate X Average Order Value / Lifetime Value = Revenue.

To increase revenue you need to pull as many of those levers as you can.

Here's a few that have worked for me:

(1) Tiered discounts for sales where people save more when they spend more.

(2) One-click upsell apps that suggest related products before people checkout.

(3) Making sure people don't need to log-in in order to buy.

(4) Showing Facebook ads to past customers not just new traffic to increase LTV.

(5) Offering bundles when you can to get people to buy 3 shirts instead of 1, etc.

dropship,Getting clicks but no sales on new store,"(My store is only 4 days old, this is my first store and I would love some advice.)

So basically my competitor started in March this year in a new niche and that store straight up exploded. They now have 200k followers on Instagram and thousands of reviews on their site.

Their website looks like absolute trash, yet they still sell a lot of units. I had a hard look at their website and created one that runs well on mobile, looks neat and tidy and is easy to understand (I tested that with a few people). I also have fewer cringy texts.

So on paper I believe my presentation is much better. But I'm obviously lacking social proof. I don't have an Instagram account, I don't have any reviews on my site. I don't have happy customers on my page featuring the product. I haven't even sold my first unit yet.

I know exactly where they produce their stuff and how much the shipping is. So I can compete on price but I'm charging 10 bucks more to have more room for ads.

I've been testing FB ads (Instagram story video) and have some solid performers already (2% CTR) with a rather cheap CPC (&lt;10 cents).

I'm getting clicks but I'm not getting conversions. Only 1/3 of people (n=400) go from the homepage to the product page. Seems like a solid number to me but out of those 30% nobody adds anything to their cart or customizes the product.

To combat that I installed an exit intend app that questions the user shortly before they leave the site. 75% say all is well, 15% want more customizable stuff and 10% think it's too expensive.

So yea, I'm a bit at a loss here. Are my ads just entertaining but not selling the product? The product is clearly selling like hotcakes for my (only) competitor who is having rapid growth. But I don't even have a single soul adding it to their cart. Maybe it's the price but it's similar to my competitor (they charge 40, I charge 50).

I understand that 400 clicks and a 4 day old store without sales isn't the end of the world. But I would love some advice on what I should tackle next to improve the situation. 

Thanks!

My ads lead to clicks but nobody adds anything to their cart.

A pleasant day to you!


This is to acknowledge that we have received your response.


We feel sorry to know that your application always got rejected for the third time. I completely understand how you feel about it. As I know that having such an issue is frustrating and confusing, why you can't pass the registration.
On behalf of Lazada, we sincerely apologize for the delay and all the inconveniences caused.



Further to this, we see that you would like to know what's wrong with your application process. However, upon further coordination to our relevant Department handling the application process. We regret to inform you that they cannot disclose any information and the main reason for the application rejection.



Also, according to them, if the seller got rejected for the third time. Our Haunting Team cannot process in the meantime the seller's registration to be a cross-border seller. And we can't process yet your category whitelisting concern, as your account is not yet verified. I understand that this is not the information you wish to hear from us. However, please be advised that you can still resubmit your application after 6 months from the last time you have submitted your application. In the meantime, please use this time to work on your marketing plan/strategy and look for as many products you can sell for more possible sales.



On behalf of Lazada, I would like to personally thank you for your time, patience and interest in being part of the Lazada family. We hope to partner with you in the very near future towards the success of your business.



Have a nice day ahead! 



Best regards,


**My response**


You are telling me that i got rejected the third time and cannot resubmit? 

 

This whole time, all i was doing was asking how to submit correctly to avoid something like this...

 

I was never given any guidelines or suggestions on what the problem is nor was i informed that there was a 3 strike rule.

 

I took the onboarding course on seller central and all it said was to submit information honestly and everything will be fine. 

 

 

I am being punished for doing everything as told by lazada.

 

 

May i please appeal and have someone look over my case again? 

 

Thank you very much




**lazada Response** 

A pleasant day to you!



We fully understand where you coming from as such situation is truly annoying, knowing that you've never given any guidelines. We already asked our relevant department several times about the qualifications for a seller to pass the application. Also, if what part of the application does a seller failed for the seller to prepare what is needed. However, unfortunately, they said that they are unable to share the list of qualifications to us and the main reason for the application rejection, since it is confidential information for the Haunting Team. As much as we want to help you, we sincerely regret to inform you that are not in the position to provide you with the detailed information you need.



Moving forward, what we can suggest now is to get back to us after 6 months to re-process your application. We know that it is a long time, but we believe that you can use this time to work on your business plan or things that you need to consider before going online in Lazada.



Please accept our sincerest apologies once again for all the inconveniences brought about this issue.

shopify,"Shopify Integration with CRM, HelpDesk, Chat, Email Marketing","Hi Everyone

Our team has growing pains: Customer &amp; team communication are getting out of hand, and I'm looking for a way to improve that.  We have a 10 member team right now and it's a good time to find a good tool. Doing it later will be a lot more difficult.

Looking for suggestions for a tool that integrates with Shopify (it's our main sales channel) and combines the following features. I found several contenders that come close (below). If you have any insight or experience - please share. I would really love to find 1 tool that does it all (***switching between multiple apps is clunky, expensive and time-consuming)***

## Features

In order of importance:

1. Integrates with Shopify
2. CRM / Sales Team support ( currently using Hubspot, but it's expensive)
3. HelpDesk ( customer service  aka shared mailbox)
4. Chat ( from the website that integrates with HelpDesk &amp; CRM - considering Drift &amp; LiveChat, but that's 1 more separate app to use )
5. Call Center ( right now using for 800 + contacts, but willing to move )
6. Email Marketing Automation ( using Mailchimp for 15K contacts - monthly newsletters, abandoned cart engagement, eDrip for sales team)
7. Social-media channels (using SproutSocial right now)
8. Video-Calling / Conferencing / Screen-sharing ( using Slack &amp; Zoom right now, Hangouts are going away)
9. Meeting scheduling ( like Calendly)

**Bonus points:**

1. Integration with Google Business Suite (or whatever it's called now)

Considering that we already pay for Hubspot, Mailchimp, SproutSocial, Hangouts (via Google, but it's being retired !) and Drift (in the near future), monthly bill racks up quickly! *( And some of these tools duplicate each other)*

So if we could combine that into 1 ( or 2 at most ) apps , that integrate with Shopify ( WITHOUT having to again pay for 3rd party integration via Zappier-like tool - or at least without going overboard).

## Goals

1. Combines multiple tools
2. Improves customer service
3. Keeps everything to 1-2 screens ( our Sales team is very mobile - they work off laptops &amp; phones, so screen real estate or having to open multiple windows is just, counterproductive)
4. Reduces monthly SAAS bill

## Contenders

These apps hit most (90%) of our requirements.

1. ZenDesk
   1. They seem to have the best integration with Shopify out of other choices, but as I understand it's in the HelpDesk module not in CRM ( ZenDesk Sell)
2. Teamwork
   1. Shopify integration with CRM is via Zapier ( which is a problem)
3. FreshWorks
   1. Pricing is not clear ( when combining multiple modules - it rack up quickly)
4. User
   1. This was one of the top choices for me initially, but they don't have a Shopify integration (only via Zapier at this point, which quickly will rack up a bill)
5. Salesforce
   1. This is the 800 gorilla in the room. My previous experience with them was not great - I had a distinct feeling that I was being ""SAP""-ing or ""Oracling"" if you know what I mean, but that was a few years ago. Supposedly they more focus on small business now.
6. Keep the same hodge-podge of apps &amp; add/switch missing ones
   1. CRM: Hubspot
   2. Helpdesk: GroovHQ or Helpscout
   3. Web &amp; Team Chat: Drift / Shopify Ping / LiveChat
   4. Social Channels: SproutSocial / Buffer / Hootsuite
   5. Email Marketing: Google Suite + MailChimp
   6. Video Calling: Using Zoom &amp; Slask may give Google Hangout Chat a try, as they are working to improve it.
   7. Scheduliyearsng: Google Suite - basically emailing back and forth between people. :D

dropship,The One Skill That Generated An Extra $3K Revenue a Month,"Now I’m probably going to sound like a guru because I'm sharing a personal experience that brought my business thousands a month by using a skill that anyone can do. 

**That skill is being able to tell a story.** 

Not just any once upon a damsel in distress story, but a story of guiding your audience into believing they’re the superhero and you’re the bridge to do just that. 

For example, think of that guru who’s always selling you a course for a low price of a bajillion dollars. Notice the careful choice of words they use. Does it play to your emotions? Is it aligning with your desires? Does it make you feel like you're going to waste time and money without it? 

The proof is in the pudding that it’s not what they’re saying but *how* they’re saying it. 

They’re telling you a story of how you can become your best self and they are the bridge to get you there. They use their own story and past clients' stories. Now it's up for debate if any of this is true, but they make you want to believe it regardless. That's why so many can get away with it. (Not saying this is ok, but rather just how powerful this skill is)

*So why not apply this to your product(s)?* 

How can you tell the story your audience wants to hear? Or how about the ‘need’ to hear? Everyone wants to be the hero of their own story. To be cool and accepted so I like to purchase that cool lambo, take photos of it with the latest iPhone model, and then tweet about it to my millions of followers. Does your t-shirts, custom jewelry, or whatever it is you sell make someone feel like that. Can you change it if it doesn't?

What about the metal straws that are saving the environment or the posture corrector that helps the mom see her daughter walk down the aisle. Let's get passionate about that because if you're not, don't expect your customers to do for you.

Let's make this a new year's resolution for 2020 to be the bridge your customer needs. Or better yet, let's start right now and make the new year come to us.

ecommerce,When does a discounted price become a regular price? Are there any legal implications (EU)? What are the best practices?,"Hello, we have a manufacturing business making women clothing mainly for local wholesalers. For the past couple of years we've been selling online to end customers as well.

Several times a year we introduce new products and during the ""shelf-life"" of those items we set the prices as follows:

Starting - Higher then normal price for the first couple of months  
Base - Normal amount we would like to get for the product  
Liquidation - Bare minimum, usually just covering costs

My question is, since our products can have a ""shelf-life"" from anywhere between several months to a couple of years, how should we display those prices and deal with discounts on our website? I'll give an example:

Starting - $100  
Base - $80  
Liquidation - $60

We introduce a new product for a Starting Price of $100. Two months later we discount it to $80 and display -20% on our website. Now, do we keep this discount forever or should we make the regular price $80 at some point? Subsequently, should the product goes to liquidation for $60 do we display a discount of 40% (100-40%=60) or 25% (80-25%=60)?",5,4,2019-12-06,ECOM,0.03854998201131821,0.9268569946289062,0.03459305688738823
shopify,No Demand for my product or wrong marketing?,"Hi all,

reading in this sub for a while already. Started my own Shopify store in September, with a partner.  
Having a basic website, some social proof and a quite competitive price, we still do not manage to make a sale. So far the site had 4000 visitors, mostly through FB ads.   
Right now we are at a point where we stopped FB ads and lost interest. (We are working locally with the factory which is producing my product).

What makes the product special is that we have artists who paint some accents on the prints by hand, that takes time and ensures uniqueness. So its not the typical Aliexpress dropshipping.

Currently we have been thinking that the product just isn't right.   
Price wise we can't do much, regular shipping costs are already included and we also offer discounted DHL shipping.   
Actually our margins right now are not high. (if we ever had a sale)

I have been all against giving Google full control since mutual incentives are not tied. But my other e-commerce friends told me to do it since ""Google is smarter than you are."" I would like to hear what you experts think. Any feedback will be helpful. :)

So I am doing the Google smart campaign thingy -- I have been running it for couple days, and I realized that it's a sinkhole for cash. I tried to set the maximum cpc bid -- doesn't work I set it but they ignore it. It just bids whatever it feels like -- I guess that's the essence behind the smart campaign.

I was wondering at this point, is it worth forgoing my control, and let Google decide what's best for me? So far (couple days, my conventional ads outperform smart campaigns (by a large margin). I am torn.

Should I give in couple more days (which means couple thousand bucks) to see what's going on? Google claims that performance gets better after two weeks.... but I am skeptical about anything these people say.

dropship,Take off powered by shopify,"Found something on fb saw that it had long shipping times 5-21 days. Went to bottom and sure enough it said powered by shopify. It also said original price 110 with it striked out and now at 50 something. So i looked it up on AliExpress and it was there sitting below $20. 

The video i saw went viral so i know they are probably making bank making $30+ and the video itself was shared about 3k times and it says 6.5M views. Btw it is a one product store.

If this sounds like you then get rid of the shopify at the bottom. If that wasnt their i would have just marked up the shipping times as being generous and hope it came closer to the 5 day mark. And wouldnt think of it as dropshipping with how professional everything looked.

ecommerce,The best services to start your eCommerce site and what to watch out for.,"I’m working on setting up my first eCommerce store and want to make sure I’m starting off well. Services I’d need:

Domain Name Registration

* 1 of the names I’d like is expiring soon and is someone who has registered with GoDaddy (icann says client renew prohibited). Any tips on the approach here or is it simply go to GoDaddy the day it expires and see what they are charging and it’s that or nothing?
* The other name doesn’t have a registrar. Can I shop this around registrars or would one of them automatically reserve it when I ask about it and their automated process determines that no one has it reserved?

Hosting

* I can program the website myself and may use AMP (a service which uses caching on Google). Should I use Google to host so if a user navigates from an AMP to a non-AMP page it would be more seamless? Could this help my page rank better and get lower ad prices if I host on Google?
* Should I use Amazon Web Services to save $ on order fulfillment and would they provide shopping cart functionality for free and/or at a good discount?
* Should I just go with the lowest price here since I’m programming the site myself and could buy a shopping cart 3rd party? Do I need to worry about some of them loading slow and having other issues? What is the best option?

Shopping Cart

* Any advice here? I’d like to have the ability to send someone straight to a loaded cart, but could program this myself if the app doesn’t disallow it. Is there a free open source cart that works well? Should I look for one that goes with the hosting company or merchant account?

Merchant Account

Does it matter who's service I use here or should I just look for the best pricing? Can I choose one with a low monthly fee to start and switch to one with no per transaction costs once I start selling a lot or it is tough to switch while you’re in business?

Any other advice (or warnings from your past) is appreciated!",5,12,2019-12-09,ECOM,0.030839385464787483,0.9285507202148438,0.0406099297106266

dropship,Some tips for FB Ads,"Just putting this here since a lot of ppl sent me DMs about how helpful this was. I will also add more here whenever I think of it. Feel free to add what's worked/not worked for you in the comments.

***

Inclusion criteria:

* Engaged Shoppers

* (specific age range) - Don't go overly broad. You can usually google things like ""who buys consumer electronics"" and you'll find articles giving you a specific age range. So, for consumer electronics, I'd put an age range between 25 - 54 instead of the general 18 - 65+.

* (specific gender) - No matter what the product is, it's usually marketed better towards one gender than the other.

* (specific income level) - For consumer electronics I need to target ppl who have money, so I usually opt to only have ppl who are in the top 25% of the US income level. You can target in the top 50, 25, 10, or 5.

***
Exclusion criteria:

* Dropshipping

* Aliexpress

* Alibaba US &amp; UK

* Cheap/Deals/Coupons (i usually sell med to high ticket items so I like to exclude anyone who has an interest in anything like deals/coupons/etc)

* Influencers on FB/Social media (Influencers are just like dropshippers - they're trying to make money online - so they're not going to be active buyers when they're online)

* Education level Masters/Doctorate/PhD/etc (ppl with high level educaiton are less likely to make impulse buys)

These are the general criteria I can think of without going too niche specific - but if you think a bit you can come up with additional inclusion/exclusion criteria to narrow your targets down even further.

Keep in mind that in the beginning, the FB ad algorithm doesn't like it if you have such a narrow audience - it has trouble figuring out who is going to buy your product.

Hope it helps.

***

**Psychological tips:**

* Days of the week are important. People don't buy on Mondays. So for ad testing purposes, only start a campaign on a Tuesday or following day (I personally prefer Wednesday to Sunday).

* Time of the year is important. Everyone wants to advertise around holidays. But as we get past the middle of December, I think most of the holiday shopping is done for most people - so you may be wasting your ad spend if you keep pushing ads after this. And people spend too much during holiday times so the month after a major holiday you see ppl trying to save money and not spending. So, for example, January would not be the best time to run ads. 

* In your marketing content - use images of people using your products instead of just images of your products. Studies have proven that pics/videos of your product in action are always more converting. It can go really deep - for example, if you have a person in your picture looking towards your CTA, the target audience who sees the ad will follow his gaze and look at the CTA too, which means they are more likely to press it and go to your landing page.

***

Edits:

* *Engaged shoppers: A lot of us use this as an inclusion criteria and can give us a good target audience but the way FB knows who's an engaged shopper is if they click on the ""shop"" button when they're shown ads on FB/IG. So, it doesn't include ppl who shop online through other means like Amazon. So, don't think that this criteria is absolute - if you don't get sales with this criteria, try a campaign without this criteria and see what happens.*",30,80,2019-12-10,ECOM,0.04549618810415268,0.9265741109848022,0.027929672971367836

Use a barcode scanner to input inventory on to the system for sale, to process item for dispatch when it has been sold, to allow for the input of Royal Mail / Courier tracking codes.

I also need to be able to generate barcodes in future - for garments etc.

In time, I will be hiring people to take care of this part of the operation for me, so the system needs to be pretty secure in terms of tampering.

ecommerce,"I recently found out I have ADHD, and have been surprised to learn it's super common in entrepreneurship! It's inspired me to build a tool around managing the symptoms and medication - love to hear some feedback - and curious how many of us are out there!","Hey everyone,

I recently found out I have ADHD (and Aspergers :D). I come from a family of entrepreneurs, and now sort of realize why I am so driven to do my own thing, and find it so boring to take the more typical path in life.

Part of being diagnosed means I've started being medicated with Ritalin, which has been really amazing and weird. I can suddenly think clearly for the first time in my life, yet of course the side effects are a annoying to say the least.

So as a way to solve some of the downsides I've built a chrome extension which monitors how I write (so I don't rant in a messenger conversation), and begun using it to monitor how my mental state and also how the medication is working. It creates a journal of your mental health over time (so in the day and over a month etc) and works for everyone (not just ADHD sufferers, so you can track if you are feeling down over time for example).

After talking to a few of my friends with ADHD (and also ecomm people lol), they have started using the app, and so I'm super curious about how many other people are interested in using it.

It got me thinking, so, every year, a certain type of sunglasses come into fashion, what if, we all agreed on a certain style of sunglasses and/or accessory and all do influencer ads, so those glasses become the fashion. 

We could then set up the shops and send out the ads and hope for sales.

For some reason it really wasn’t about the niche, but the product (this niche is very saturated). Even after directing traffic to just one sunglass type after various split testing, I changed and mixed it up, and still sold that same sunglasses pair even after directing to different sunglasses. That one pair still became a hot seller either way. Almost like a magnet.

Making almost $1.5-2k steady per week for 7 months now off one pair of sunglasses. Absolutely the weirdest experiment I’ve done by far.

Any explanations as to why this works so well? I’ve got some data, and some explanations, but wanted some perspective to see why the hell such a weird and potentially risky experiment turned so.. decent?

shopify,Fulltime Digital Marketer to Self-Employment Again [Success],"In 2015, I opened my first dropshipping store. Before gurus, before everyone was talking about dropshipping. I did $785,000 in revenue in a year and a half. I profited about $150,000 before I turned 20. Being naive, ignorant, and young, I spent about $75,000 of that in in a year and a half on dumb materialistic purchases, and partying. My business died because I was too busy partying that I stopped caring about my customers and my brand was soon tarnished. I was a failure in my mind. It was a huge wake-up call.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2019, I took a job at a digital marketing agency, after graduating college with a bachelors in marketing and minor in advertisement. The work environment was so-so. I really admired my boss and coworkers, but believed I deserved more than I was being compensated for (it was a start-up, so in no way am I blaming them. They paid and gave what they could afford to.)

&amp;#x200B;

While working, I had an idea for a new dropshipping store. At work, I was under contract that anything I started there was their property- so I quit 6 months after starting. November was rough, not much action. I was profiting about $50 a day which was about a 75% pay cut from my previous job. I have money in the bank, and I WANT this, I need this to work. I continued to test new audiences, and run facebook ads just like I did at my previous job. Black Friday weekend I saw my first $500 profit day, and from there it only went up and I grew confidence to spend more and more everyday. Today, December 10th, I cleared $3,000 profit. This month about $15k profit total. (sales proof below)

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I will tell you all, is don't give up and **continue testing**. I see many posts from people testing facebook ads at low budgets ($10-20 a day). This is fine, in no means am I saying throw your life savings into a dropshipping store and hope it works. But please understand, If you're spending 10-20 at a 6 ROAS (insanely tough to achieve) you will be making little profit still. A 2+ ROAS is great. Dropshipping is not a get rich quick scheme. Build your store, do market research, compile amazing creative, and dive into it! You must understand at a low budget, you will get low amounts of data. Facebook ads = success when you have data.

&amp;#x200B;

Goodluck, and kill it out there. One 22 year old 'entrepreneur' to another.

And there is probably some code tweaking going on for little things on some of the sites. But, you have to strive to make your websites like these.

A like campaign on Facebook will do many things for you and your business page while drop shipping. The highlights of like campaigns are...

✦ Legit fans brought to your Facebook page, creating social proof and trust which is REQUIRED!

✦ Generates an audience of fans that you can RETARGET! Like campaigns will create an Audience that is more likely to engage on your page and purchase products for you.

(Fun Fact): Facebook shows your ad TWO TIMES more to fans than non-fans

✦Like campaigns are cheap to run ($5 to $10 a day)  and will easily return your investment if you execute correctly.

dropship,Why drop shipping has let me down without even starting it,"Last year on this very day, I quit my job, decided to start my own thing on the internet. I was terribly attracted to drop shipping because it was easy to start. And if it went well I could have my own business and made a living out of it.



So after one year of devouring blog posts on drop shipping , researching niches, buying premium courses on Facebook ads, SEO, Adwords and even on designing logos, I realized that I should never start a drop shipping business.



I chickened out. Yes and in this post I’ll tell you why I think it’s not a good idea to get into drop shipping. At least for someone who likes to have all the dots connected before forging ahead.



The world has enough e-commerce stores.



As I write, this post there are nearly 102.37 million e-commerce stores in 29 different languages across 166 countries in the world. (source statista.org). On an average an e-commerce store sells 9 products which makes it nearly 900 million products up for sale. There’re 4 billion people on the internet (source ourworldindata.org) and if I apply the average conversion rate of 2% to all the people who use internet, it turns out to be 80 million. So it’s clear that on the macro-level supply is way over the demand. This brings me to my second reason of not starting an e-commerce store.


Why would people or audience of my niche will buy from  me?



I dug deep to find the answer to this question. I bought courses from gurus who promised to answer this question. The answer was very obvious even before I asked this question, which was USP. But I thought maybe USP is a passé. There’s something more that people do to sell products on the internet. After all the internet is fraught with young lads in their 20s roaming around in Lamborghinis that they bought from making money by drop shipping. But most of the gurus didn’t have the answer. All they talked about is facebook audience selection, niche selection, retargeting and all generic stuff.



Then I asked myself how to create an USP. After all in simplest terms it means the ultimate value that the customer receives when he buys your product. And what is value, it’s nothing but a perception created by a smart marketer in the customer’s head that the product delivers more than what the customer is paying for it. If we were to go to the route of use-value and exchange-value of a product then most of the products in the world will be nothing but commodities. But that’s a different story altogether. Coming back to the topic, all a drop shipper does is that it feeds on the laziness or ignorance of an average shopper and puts forth a product that the shopper wants by sourcing it from Aliexpress or Aliexpress in Halloween costume, Oberlo. I asked myself if I were selling say, a crystal dildo with an automatic vibrator to a woman in god forsaken part of America, what USP will I present to her? If I were to say that it’s the only dildo that is nature’s gift that can make you give up men all your life then do I think will it last? Should I presume that no one else will come up with a better USP than mine and steal her from me? And what will make her my repeat customer, even if I give her discounts and free shipping? I frankly didn’t get any convincing answers.



This brought me to the solution USP problem, which is positioning. How do I position myself to my niche so that I appear as unique? I can’t make my product unique unless I go down to the product development and patenting route which is a different ball game altogether. I need to make my business unique by making a statement that will position me in a unique way to my prospective customer. And it’s easy to come up with the statement, the hardest part is the occupying the customer’s mind with that statement. This can only be done by branding. The constant hammering of the message on the customer that it gets ingrained in her mind that what I sell is unique because I stand for something. In my dildo example, I stand for making men disposable for women, when it comes to sex. But this requires heavy marketing budget, which can easily run into 5-6 figures for a drop shipping start up. Else how would my business be sustainable in the long run? If I were to get into drop shipping for making a quick buck then I’d rather not go there. Instead I’ll learn black jack and try my luck in Vegas. That has got more chances of success rather than a drop shipping store.



Another thing that stopped me from getting into starting a drop shipping store is the shipping time. Well, I always wondered are the customers so stupid that they won’t realize that the product is shipped from China? In this age where everything is available before even you click your mouse, is the customer so desperate that he will wait for 3-4 weeks for the product to arrive? And I’ve ordered a lot of times using e-packet. I mean the way the packaging is done, in an ugly greyish plastic bag with the product trapped between the bubble wraps ,I mean, what impression the package will create for my business? Will that customer ever buy from me? Again? Will he ever wait for 3-4 weeks, no matter how unique my product is? And are the wholesalers in US or in other countries so blind that they won’t notice what’s selling in aliexpress and buy those products in tons thereby reducing the product price and shipping time when they resell it in US? Do I stand any chance against those resellers who will sell the products cheaper than I’m selling and shipping it faster? The answer I got for all the above questions is NO.



All the things that I heard about drop shipping, all the stories from gurus selling courses, all the promises that the internet made to me, the Ferisses and Tony Robins’ they all slowly appear to me as scammers of disproportionate magnitude. Maybe it worked 10 years ago but now, given the principles on which businesses operate, drop shipping is a pipe dream. People, like me get sucked into it, time and again. They learn, some even make a quick buck here and there but to me it appeared more a matter of luck and gambling.


Now some of you might say, yes drop shipping is not for the long term. You get in, you spend a year or so in it, make a killing and exit. But even if I take it in this way, I ask myself, what if I’d to pump in lot of money in advertising, only to realize that ship has already sailed. 


I realized that drop shipping is not a business model. It’s just a way of making momentary profit on the ignorance and laziness of an average human. As the gurus say that it relies on impulse buying, which I beg to differ. Because impulse with time fades away and logic takes over especially when the customer has to wait for 4 weeks to get a substandard product in a terrible package.

Screenshot --&gt; [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r6vLpVVSB89JELiIEfKkS3ijSE2FJFC9/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r6vLpVVSB89JELiIEfKkS3ijSE2FJFC9/view?usp=sharing)

Hey everyone, hope you will learn from my experience and use this knowledge for success!

1. The product I was selling was very general and problem solving one with a potential audience size in hundreds of millions.

In the first days of testing it, I was barely breaking even and on some of the days even 10-15% in loss. After a week, I wanted to quit but I decided to create last few adsets with different targeting angles to see if I find something that is working.

Fortunately, the adsets started to get sales and the campaign started to get momentum as well as profitability. At this point, I have been over 1000-1500 USD in loss but as I was gathering more and more data and trying new interests, I was able to make it back and from there, scaled it to almost 100k/m with 15-17% profit margins.

The lesson is - if you are testing a very general product, sometimes FB needs more data, more audiences and more spent before it finds the right people to show the product to. The whole idea that if you do not get sales on the first day of testing means that the product is not a winner is complete bullshit.

It might be true in some cases, but it is definitely not a rule.

\*\* Quick side note \*\* ( after gathering data, even the audiences that were not working at all at the start started to get 2-3 ROAS easily)

2. After the nice reversal of performance and huge increase in profitability, some of my prospecting campaigns started to die again.

At first, it was very frustrating and I thought that I will have to quit once again, but after looking at data from my past few weeks, I realized that my top of the funnel audiences and adsets were never achieving huge ROAS. It was the retargeting audiences ( ATCs, Website Visitors, % Video Views, Time Spent, Ad Engagers etc..) that have been bringing most of the profits and sales.

That's when I realised that as long as bring in sustainable amount of traffic, it is enough for me to break even or even be little bit in loss for my prospecting campaigns, because my retargeting campaigns and backend will do the work.

The lesson - the money is at the backend and retargeting campaigns! Do not always look for great results on prospecting campaigns.

3. The reason why the sales curve is not so stable, is because of facing multiple issues, such as hitting credit card monthly spent limits, Paypal holds &amp; Stripe holds, problems with Shopify Payments, Facebook ad account bans etc... These are the problems everyone is facing in this industry and can not be easily or fully avoided.

However, what im trying to say is that if you see you have a possibility to scale your business to high numbers, make sure your systems are in place to handle everything ( customer support, supplier, documents for payment providers etc.., bank).

The lesson: If all or most of the parts of your business are not ready for scalling and bringing increased amount of revenue and traffic, do not try to scale. You might earn some bucks in the short term period, but these issues will eventually catch up with you. If you are not planning to win, you are planning to fail.

shopify,I built a tool for r/shopify that finds profitable products on Aliexpress by order growth + profit!,"I created a platform called DropshipScan which scrapes thousands of products every day from Aliexpress and uses this data to rank them based on order growth over time, and of course you can test it for free: [Dropshipscan.com](https://dropshipscan.com/)

On AliExpress you can sort products by the amount of orders, but this isn't a good indicator for how popular this products are at the moment. **What you really want to look at is, how much the order volume changed in the last couple of days and weeks**.

And thats exactly what you can do with my new tool. But it gets better, it also estimates the profit margin you can expect for every product by using the official APIs of the big e-commerce platforms. Using the descriptions and keywords of the products from Aliexpress it searches for similar listings and gets the retail prices of them. It always uses a weighted average to have the most realistic estimation and to not rely on outliers.

With this unique ranking method of order growth AND the estimated profit margins it can help you to be miles ahead of the competition and to stop wasting time with products that don't sell or don't make much profit at all. For example you can set a minimum profit margin, sort by order growth descending and search with keywords from your niche to get exactly the products you need to make money!

And of course you can add the results to a watchlist and export them as a CSV with all titles, prices, pictures etc. to use them with Shopify or Woocommerce.

shopify,Few tips for begginers,"Here’re several FB advertising tips I gather from my own experiences and from sellers who do 6 figures a month from Facebook Ads to their online stores.
Please note, these tips are subjective. Your job is to verify and test to find out what works for you and what doesn’t.
1) Testing period:
2 weeks. You need to give 15 days to your 'confusing ads' to judge them. By confusing ads I mean the one which:
a) Get you a lot of social interaction - and very fewer sales
b) Sales are different every day
c) Suddenly, no sales
2) Facebook algorithm (change the way you see it):
Facebook ads are nothing but just an online script that works on predefined functions.
Your results are based on what you sell and to whom you sell. Touching facebook ads software in any way like increasing budget 'restarts' the mechanism.
3) Ads start:
Always start your ads at 12.00 AM (of whichever country you are promoting). Facebook software needs time to optimize your ads as they have to do the same with millions of other adverts. 24 hours frame is needed for it to work.
4) Kill ads:
See, if you are promoting something on Facebook then I am sure you very well know how to choose your audience. So, whatever audience you have selected is the right audience, don't sweat on it. If you are not selling well, it means your item (T-shirt/necklace/mug/cap/rabbit) is oversold here.
5) It needs money:
Facebook ads need money in testing and failures. Have at least $2000 in your account (depending on your experience with ads). This could be relative. However, once you have this money, forget about it. Scare money never grow your business.
6) Initial testing:
Simply create 2 adsets i.e mobile and desktop (18-65+) with a budget like Rs.1000 ($20 each or $10 each). 3,000 reach is what I look for.
7) Facebook will eat your money:
Facebook ads software is created to (first) eat your money and then do its job. I call it 'Facebook donation days [FDD]'. When you start a campaign they will your money as much as you set the limit. Start small and let it run for days, this way you control spending and get some conclusive data.
8) Hitting BIG with FB ads software:
4 Figures a day sales are easy on facebook and all it needs is ONE product. I focus on 1 product at a time (primarily because I do hard research on niches) and live with it. I could spend 3-4 months selling only 1 product and making my pixel stronger.
9) Create multiple sets of copy:
I’ve seen firsthand how much a change in copy can transform an ad. Earlier this year, a simple adjustment in the copy on a campaign reduced the CPC from $9.40 to under $1.50. I recommend creating sets of ad copy, which each include several headlines and several ad texts that work cohesively together. Each of the texts and headlines should be focused on a single message, emotional appeal, or pain point, but they’re written in different languages and styles. Test out bullet points, longer paragraphs, short sentences.
10) Retargeting:
Of course, this is the 'father' of all sales techniques. I personally create 3-4 retargeting campaigns including 'Dynamic ads'. I start with 1 retargeting campaign and after 14-15 days, create 2-3 more depending on what other products were 'appreciated' by the customers.

dropship,$40k In 100 days: Bootstrapped Case Study (AMA),"Hey reddit, I’m David. I launched a few stores in the past during my beginning phase of Dropshipping which made some sales but were mainly lessons that lead to this store. This store is a boot-strapped joint venture with my homie (who I carried but had the bread lol) that started with $500 and was scaled (roughly and slowly) to $40,000 in 100 days with around 25% net. We made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot that will make us unstoppable in future launches, but we also did a lot right and I believe that sharing this journey with you guys will bring some newer, and even more advanced e-commerce guys value. 

[Rev](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I_pB5n9lXTr8_UXUp521-qGRf4cTNpDJ/view?usp=drivesdk) 

-quick shameless plug: no I don’t sell courses, yes I do offer consultations, no they’re not free or for people not serious

Since that’s over with, I can get into the good stuff. Of course I’m not giving the product away unless you wanna buy the store (10% of rev a.k.a steal). I will highlight however, that we went for a product with under 10k orders on the first few AliExpress listings and under 500k views on FB. As for how we structured the lower budget launch it was as follows: CBO $90/day, 3 adsets $30 max limits, lowest cost bidding (would do it differently now), 750-4m potential reach, 4 ads with one copy variation each.

🐉 Post Launch

At launch we had the product priced at almost 2x what we settled at...needless to mention, we had no sales the first 3 days (we did have buying intent though). Seeing as we had ATCs, our CPC wasn’t looking bad, and we had more money, we immediately started testing variables to optimize. Many give up without legitimately attempting to succeed first (trying other ways to become profitable). Price point, and audiences were the first variables we tested. We lowered the price point from 60 to 34.99 and I remember getting sales the same day we did. As for audiences, that’s something we definitely had to keep testing and changing. This is because our pixel was brand new so getting customers from cold audiences was more expensive and we were bootstrapped so we had to succeed at this stage without running out of money. The goal at this point if you don’t know is trying to be profitable/breakeven until you build data for custom audiences/LAAs.

🐉 Building Data

After scraping up cheap sales by changing out audiences/creatives very consciously to preserve cash-flow, we launched our first few batches of LAAs: 50% VV, 75% VV, 95% VV, and ATC. Only 95% VV and ATC segments were profitable for us but they definitely out-performed cold interests. We used profits during this time to cover losses we took building data and catch up on orders which leads me to our first biggest issue, page feedback score. Don’t let your page go under penalty or you’ll likely get your venture halted. Due to us not being informed enough on what to do to prevent this (setting delivery times and focusing on fulfillment over all else), even though we had zero successful chargebacks filed on us, high ad costs caused us to have to halt ads (thank FB for this post).

🐉 Scaling

As for how we launched/ran LAAs (we did the same at 100 Purchases with PUR and IC), we segmented defined audience sizes at 3-10x CPA budgets and let them run for at least 3 days for machine learning to do its thing. 3-4 ads, two variations (test video, photo, and carousel images) and scaled through increasing the budget on “winning audiences” (profitable after 3+ sales) by 10-30% and again every 3 days of profitability. We killed ads (not adsets) based on 7 day time frame profitability which we saw elongated the actual length of the adset’s lifespan. We had rules in place to kill trash ads as well to hedge our risk. At an optimal daily budget (at least 8x CPA) I would recommend cycling in new creatives as others die, before this I would just focus on gathering profit to upgrade my campaign structure. Our pixel was getting juicy to the point where we didn’t need to target as strictly any more (500+ purchases).

🐉 Conclusion/thoughts


For a bootstrapped venture by two guys with limited combined knowledge, we managed to make some money and gain priceless experience. There’s a ton of mistakes and successes that I didn’t include because idk how much you guys read on here. I could literally make multiple threads on different experiences with this venture (and others). For example, our AOV was $60 and I didn’t even mention retargeting (at least $5k came from it). Anyways, ask me anything!

-TL;DR We started with like $500 sold like $40k, made like $10k

dropship,Finding the Winning Product?,"Hey guys. I have a few questions about knowing if a product can actually sell. So I found a product that has around 3000-5000 total orders, from a few different suppliers. One supplier even has over 1000 reviews posted. The thing is, that I find some pages and videos on Facebook about this product, but not anything huge. There are some videos even from almost two years ago. But what's bothering me is, that the product is still getting sales on AliExpress. Avg. 30 per day during this month. Can this actually be a winning product?

And my second question is about Oberlo and some AliExpress products. So the product I'm talking about above, there are few suppliers that have 1k+ and 3k+ orders. I tried importing the supplier the one that has more orders and reviews to Oberlo, but I got an error message telling me that it's not allowed, due to:

""Pursuant to Oberlo's Merchant Terms of Service, this product is not available via Oberlo.   
Please choose another product to import."".   


Searching for the same product through Oberlo, I found other suppliers, with way fewer orders.   
Why would Oberlo not allow me to use the supplier that is apparently the most reliable?

A bit of a long read, but if you took the time to read and answer, a huge thank you in advance.

shopify,Looking For Feedback: Is My Niche Too Niche?,"Hi!

Just launched my website and brand [wiseswolemen.](http://wiseswolemen.com)

I feature real quotes on fitness and hard work from historical figures that took fitness seriously like Socrates, Ben Franklin and Teddy Roosevelt to produce motivational gym tshirts. Many of the figures talked about the benefits exercise has not just for their bodies but their intellectual accomplishments too, like Thomas Jefferson saying ""A strong body makes the mind strong""

I link to the source of all the quotes on the product pages so people can see that I'm not falsley attritubting them. Some are modern paraphrases (especially the Ancient Greek ones) but I try to make that clear as well.

I launched a week or so ago and had some sales but facebook ads are blowing a huge hole in my budget because of the increased cost of everything due to the holiday season and the waste that comes from the ""learning"" phase.

I'm not sure if anyone here goes to the gym or otherwise stays active but if you are I wonder if this resonates with you and is actually something you might wear while exercising? It obviously did with me, I find that mix of intellectual and fitness accomplishments to represent an ideal I want to strive towards, and is a perfect reminder when trying to do that last set of squats. But I didn't really do any market research, just went on a hunch that I couldn't get out of my head while trying to sleep at night.

ecommerce,Shopify vs WooCommerce,"Hey guys,

I own a small business that specializes in selling refurbished electronics. I’ve done over $550,000 in sales through eBay this year. My goal for 2020 is to set up an e-commerce site so that I can start making sales through both channels. A lot of eBay sellers do not have an independent website, a business listing with Google and don’t show up anywhere except for eBay. 

I’ve looked at Shopify, BigCommerce and WooCommerce. Originally, I was going to start with Shopify but a colleague told me that it gets really expensive really fast. 

These are the reasons why I think Shopify wouldn’t be a good fit:
- The items we sell are considered “high-risk”
- Average transaction is $700 so fees might hurt
- PayPal integration is also necessary but costs more

I don’t plan to have more than 100 items available at a time. 

The site needs to have:
- Integration with eBay
- Ability to print shipping labels (cubic priority)
- Ability to track inventory levels
- a ticket system to provide assistance to customers
- ideally be easy to manage (it’s just me)
- a trade-in or buyback option for customer’s electronics (not necessary but would be nice)

We currently pay eBay:
- $25/month for store subscription (this lowers seller fees)
- eBay fees are 3.6% per transaction
- PayPal fees are 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction 
- Anywhere from $1,500-$5,000 in seller fees per month
- We also sometimes use promoted listings (eBay’s advertising service) at a rate of 6% per purchase on top of eBay and PayPal fees
- Return labels cost us more than the original shipping cost ($22 vs $18)

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.",44,20,2019-12-17,ECOM,0.04331805557012558,0.9236431121826172,0.03303889185190201

shopify,Shopify Marketing Strategy Insights from She's Independent making $1k MRR,"Hello,

My name is Kyle and on my blog we interview entrepreneurs and many of them have launched successful side hustles and share their background, how they came up with their ideas, marketing insights, favorite apps and advice for other entrepreneurs.

This week we interviewed Natalie Levy, founder of She's Independent, a women’s empowerment business and community offering professional development and life inspiration.

This is the story of how she founded She’s Independent some Shopify Marketing Strategy tips.

Here are a few highlights of the interview:

## Shopify Marketing Strategy

## How do you acquire customers for your Shopify store?

We are constantly improving our approach to marketing. We do this in-house today but regularly evaluate working with others to offload various tasks.

We have tested a variety of tactics across social media, email marketing, affiliate marketing partners, and more recently organic search. We do some paid marketing but have not yet seen large conversion out of this funnel.

We are getting more strategic in our approach. As an example, we initially sent a monthly newsletter as our sole email marketing touch. We now leverage welcome journeys (we are still in the process of building this based on the profile of the individual) to better nurture and add value to our audience. The welcome journey is currently a 3-step touch over a week period. Shoutout to another awesome resource who hops on weekly marketing strategy calls with me. Thank you Patty Breech!

We use MailMunch to create landing pages in Shopify and MailChimp to execute email marketing campaigns. We are still working to optimize audience segmentation.

We are investing in social channels and just started leveraging a scheduler for posts. We were on Hootsuite but switched to Later given the freemium plan accomplishes what we need. Planning strategic posts in advance through a bucketing strategy (5 or 6 buckets that are key messages we want to get across) has been helpful and using a scheduler to get the heavy lifting out of the way such that I don’t have to pull time away from my day to post is really helpful. INVEST IN THIS! Does Instagram convert? Maybe. But let’s build it and test it. We post to Facebook and LinkedIn and need to step up Twitter.

In terms of optimizing organic, we reverse engineered an initial SEO and hashtag strategy based on other sites and brands whose audiences we like. We have more work to do here but are overhauling blog posts and metadata tagging to work to win on keywords that aren’t too “expensive” that see decent traffic. She’s Independent mentor and advisor Tiff Willson has been tremendously helpful in this area.

SEO takes time but is a great investment.

We tested small budgets of a few hundred dollars for various Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns as well as Google Ads and will dive back into this in the future. If you make more than you spend then try spending more. We aren’t there yet. We will ramp this up once we have a better SEO strategy implemented and further optimize our website for conversion.

Traffic today is mainly direct or from social channels but organic has recently started ranking and we expect it to grow.

Sales have recently started coming from people I don’t know which is exciting progress. This is mainly on the back of word-of-mouth and affiliate marketing partners posting on social but I expect that we will start converting paid/ social leads in pipeline.

Today we are positioned for learning and optimizing and don’t expect to be making much money (if any) but don’t want to overspend on marketing strategies that aren’t proving successful.

## Shopify Marketing Apps

## Which Shopify Marketing Apps are most important to your business?

We currently leverage MailMunch to create landing pages in Shopify. This integrates into our email marketing tool Mailchimp. We recently launched Talkable for Referrals given we wanted to roll out something simple but haven’t yet seen traction with the tool. We use PayWhirl for our SaaS membership pricing model and recurring payment mechanism.

## Shopify Store Advertising

## Do you do any advertising for She's Independent?

In terms of paid we lightly tested various Facebook campaign methods to collect leads and drive interaction and signups to webinars. 

Overall Facebook spend hasn’t proven successful from an ROI standpoint although we were collecting emails somewhat cheaply at $4-5/per where if we converted even a low percent to our paid community at an average of $30/month we would see a return.

In digging into the individual profiles of who interacted with ads it looks like we’re missing the ball here. We plan to get more targeted with our audience and test lookalike audiences to see if this produces a better return.

We are leaning towards owning the local market and building partnership and branding in Denver and then growing from there so we have pulled back on paid ads.

## Shopify marketing on Instagram

## Walk us through your Shopify Instagram strategy.

We want our brand to showcase authenticity while covering our core business areas. 

Our three defined personas include individuals interested in empowerment through rock climbing, professionals in their 20s and 30s seeking mentorship and professional development, and women 30 and 40+ seeking inspiration, community, and/or personal growth through life transitions.

Our three buckets or personas defined on our homepage pictured above.

Your story matters when selling B2C and probably even moreso when selling a community membership. 

We have an evolving content strategy which includes these personas along with profiling myself to make the business relatable and personal. Additional buckets include posting on people who inspire us and the final bucket is to repost third-party content that resonates with us. 

We need to post more video. We have great content, energy, and interactive dialogue at live events so need to do a better job of showcasing this.

Screenshot of our Instagram account along with recent posts. Pictured here you’ll find content on myself to make us relatable, showcase women who inspire, speak to the importance of community, empowerment through rock climbing, and personal and professional development content.

## Shopify 2020 Marketing Plan

## What are you marketing plans for 2020?

We plan to step up paid and Google Ads once we make more progress around the site structure and SEO implementation. One of our goals is to reach 5k visitors a month. At 10k visitors monthly we believe there will be a decent monetization opportunity from a website traffic standpoint.

We are open to reinventing social and marketing efforts based on what’s paying off. One of my marketing contacts who offers strategy and guidance on a weekly call just pointed out that we should have a strategy for Pinterest in place given that it’s great for showcasing content that doesn’t expire. Instagram posts get buried whereas Pinterest content remains searchable and highly visible. 

We’d like to do more with Facebook groups but have had limited capacity so have only lightly explored this avenue.

We’d like to do more testing across channels and then step up investment in areas we see success and pull back on areas we don’t see payoff.

We will keep investing in SEO realizing that solid organic traffic should be valuable. Our keyword strategy will evolve, and with that, content.

I kinda wanna think that it’s that time of the year where it’s hard to find people who buy online because Christmas is almost here but it’s not here yet you know how?
And even more that it’s a Home fitness accessory I guess the best time to start again is New Years? What do you guys think?",18,9,2019-12-19,ECOM,0.02729252353310585,0.9105749726295471,0.06213248148560524
dropship,7 Profitable Product Niches to Expect in 2020,"Hi everyone, 2020 is just around the corner, have you guys thought of which dropshipping niches to invest next year? I've done some researches and rounded up those best dropshipping niche ideas to offer to you guys.

**Eco-friendly products**

The green consumerism has emerged in recent years due to the increase in environmental issues. Customers are more aware of sustainable goods and start to change their consumption habits.

*What to sell?*

This niche has tons of potential to get creative, you can sell some reusable products:

* Beeswax food wrap
* Reusable adult diaper
* Straws and drinking bottles

**Health and beauty niche**

Valued at [10 billion dollars](https://www.jobcrusher.com/valued-10b-surprising-health-beauty-niche-ripe-taking/?fbclid=IwAR2pyfRyZSga5lZCN1_KyvKOrVYk8z45MoYo-UH-ktaMYFFrN64RbIexH5s), this dropshipping niche is definitely worth investing with every penny.

*What to sell?*

* Waterproof fitness tracker
* Posture corrector
* Derma skin scrubber pen
* Anti-pressure neck protection pillow

**Outdoor supplies**

My favorite one so far. This niche is a $646 billion per year market. It's too big to ignore so I suggest that you guys should consider this serious!

*What to sell?*

* Travel organizer
* Anti-theft backpack
* Raincoat with backpack protection
* Glove with LED light
* Cookware

**Tech supplies and accessories**

Another big market to put on the list. With the development of tech devices, this niche has reached a figure of 2 trillion dollars and shows no signs of declining.

*What to sell?*

* Neck phone holder
* Gesture control - Double-side stunt car
* One key switch WiFi smart socket
* Wireless chargers with different functions

**Pet goods**

Let’s not skip this one. We’ve seen the whole pet product niche takes over social media talks, especially Instagram - where creating awareness and building your brand from scratch is quite doable. It’s also easy to dropship than other markets because of its size, weight, and material.

*What to sell?*

* Pet massage tool for bath time
* Slow feeder bowls
* Ultrasonic pet flea &amp; pest repeller

**Apparel items**

This niche is not a temporary trend anymore, it is here to stay. The apparel niche is considered as a broad segment that includes an array of potential products.

*So, what to sell?*

* Novelty socks
* Foot massage slippers
* Nightwear glasses

**Home and kitchen appliances**

This last niche is too familiar for all of us but the need for home appliances never seems to stop growing.

And did I mention that it is claimed to reach 447 million in 2020? Yes, you heard it right! 447 million - it's officially one of the biggest industry right now.

*What to sell?*

* Mini humidifier
* Bathroom stool
* Multi-purpose magic sticky

Here are my choices, if you know more niches that are on the rise right now, comment below so we can have some discussions!

Have a good day guys!",44,102,2019-12-20,ECOM,0.03473442792892456,0.9278273582458496,0.037438150495290756

dropship,Dropshipping!!,"Dropshipping is a simple business model of taking a product buying for low and selling for eye. So for example I’ll go to a site like AliExpress or alibaba and I’ll find a phone case I want to sell. I specialize in one product store so after seeing if the product has potential (order counts, positive reviews, fast shipping...etc.) I’ll build a Shopify store surrounding that single product. You’ll use any of the several advertising platforms in order to run traffic to your product page and start making sales. Let say AliExpress has a product for $3.50. You’ll take that same product and sell it for maybe $19.99 or ever $26.99. When you make a sale you’ll buy the product for $3.50 and the rest is your profit to keep.

There’s a lot that goes into your marketing and making that first sell. In the dropshipping community you’ll hear a lot about finding a “winning product” listen to me closely. ALMOST EVERYTHING SELLS. The one thing a lot of guru leaves out is that the product is a popular one BUT it’s not that product that makes it winning. It’s the targeted audience, the ad copy and the presentation of the product itself. If you’re new to dropshipping please know that it’ll take a lot of time and effort and frustration to get used to the business model that is dropshipping and it’s a truly learning experience. When it comes to finding your product the one thing you need to ask yourself is... can this product be found in any general retail store? If so these are products you’ll need to stay away from. You’ll rarely be able to compete with complete conveniency. However if the product solves a problem.. (I.E posture corrector, anti gravity phone case, Bluetooth headphones...etc.) these would be viable products to put on your store and sell.

Instagram Influencers, FACEBOOK ads, YouTube ads or Google ads are platforms you need to utilize in order to start building traffic to your store. There’s a lot more that I can talk for hours about and waaay too much to type. You can use spy tools such as Adspy or Adsector to spy ads running on Facebook/instagram, then you can find many good products to sell. 

When you use Facebook ads you can exclude out people who knows about Shopify,AliExpress and dropshipping.",8,18,2019-12-20,ECOM,0.05458017811179161,0.9201668500900269,0.02525300346314907

Every day in this thread I'm going to recommend a product for you to test. Leave a comment (or message me) below if you have any questions about the product and want to discuss the market/angle/offer to use. Here to help everyone out.

Back to it - This product has sold well in the past, will (and is) selling well now, and will continue to do so in the future. It's always a product that someone who loves to travel (or knows someone who does) will want to buy. Selling a travel product in January when everyone has made their new years resolution to be to travel more = Sounds good to me.

My logical thoughts about it:

1. It's a problem solver (with an element of passion - loves travelling)
2. Not easily found in stores (a new enough product and concept)
3. 'Wow' factor - a fun product too.

I have no idea what the concurrent users would be; but assuming it does very well, let's say its quite a lot.

Is this something that is going to be a nightmare to handle for someone who isn't familiar with coding and backend development?

I would choose a managed server, such as Kinsta, but I'm not sure how much they actually do. Maintaing large blogs and small stores is easy, but a large store is something I've never done before.

I'd hate to see growth and then have a bunch of problems I can't fix.

ecommerce,First time making a landing page - How can I make it more interesting?,"The company I work for sells holidays. It's part of a package eg you book the flights, transfers, property and all meals through us.

We pre-pay for the flight seats on the inclusive charter flight we use and we have lots of empty flight seats remaining. So we've decided to start selling just the flight seats to members of the public (i.e those who are flying to the destination but haven't actually booked the holiday with us).

We've created ads so when a user browses various airlines websites, they'll receive our ad that pops up. I've designed a landing page that they'll get sent to, however the landing page is pretty dull.

I deliberately wanted a really simple landing page as it just needs people to see the basic information and call us. I want it nice and simple as too much information will distract the user from the Call To Action (to call us to book). Currently it looks a bit empty though.

If you could kindly look at it, please comment below and I'll send you the link to it via a private message. I don't want to post the webpage here as I want to keep the company I work for private. Thanks in advance!",10,4,2019-12-20,ECOM,0.028991276398301125,0.9342131614685059,0.036795590072870255

ecommerce,How to Win with eCommerce Facebook Ads in 2020,"Some people already know these points, but for those who don't, these are the ways you will win with eCommerce Facebook ads in 2020.

(1) Go broad with audiences

A few years ago, the goal was to go tight with audiences and to go niche. Now, you want to go broad and let Facebook use its algorithm to find customers. Why? Because the more broad you go, the lower your costs go (small audiences = higher cost to reach 1000 people). Facebook has also gotten really good at finding customers for you, so it's better to go broad than to limit Facebook. 

A few ways to do this: 1) You can go super broad with no targeting. This can take some time to dial in but gives Facebook the ability to figure out who they should show your ads to and can drive down costs. 2) Expand audiences by choosing your audience and then clicking expand.

(2) Make sure you bid on purchases

Again, a few years ago, the goal was to get the lowest cost per click possible. Now, Facebook has machine learning that helps you figure out who's more likely to buy. I'm not entirely sure how this works but my guess is that they show your ads more frequently to people who pause on your ad for 3 seconds because they know that means they're 10 times more likely to buy, etc.

The way to take advantage of this is to make sure you're optimizing for purchases, not clicks, reach, video views, engagement, add to carts, etc. This goes for every step of your funnel, even the very top. 

(3)  Make sure you spend enough at the top of the funnel

This is probably the biggest mistake I see people make. They may spend 50% on prospecting and 50% on remarketing or even 70% on remarketing and 30% on prospecting. Instead, you need to flip that funnel over and make sure you're spending at least 70% of your budget on prospecting. The reason is that you need to get enough people into the funnel for remarketing to work and \~70% on new traffic is the way to do that.

Keep in mind that your retargeting audiences should have around double the ROAS as compared to prospecting. So if you get a 2 ROAS for prospecting, you should get 4-5 for remarketing, etc. These numbers are just general guidelines but the blended ROAS will bring you up to where you need to be as long as you're spending enough on prospecting.

(4) Creative matters...a lot

Yes, copy matters, but creative can make or break your Facebook ad campaigns.

To make sure you're fully taking advantage of creative opportunities, you need to make sure you're using static images, story ads, videos, and dynamic product ads. All of those work great together, especially when you've got great creative assets to work with. Sometimes static works better than video, but you definitely want to make sure and test video ads as well.

(5) Don't forget about your past customers

Last but not least, you don't want to forget about your past customers. The way you grow eCommerce sales is Targeted Taffic X Conversion Rate X Lifetime Value / Average Order Value. So yes, you want to reach new people and then show remarketing ads to get even more of them to buy, but you also want to show ads to your past customers since it's easier to get someone to buy again than to acquire a new customer.

Some ways to take advantage of this are: 1) Set up campaigns, ad sets, etc. targeting past customers with your lifetime customer list or pixel purchases 2) Use email marketing to get past customers to buy.

Let me know if you have any questions about any of this.  The stores I'm working with are seeing great results with these strategies, so I wanted to take some time this morning to share.",28,93,2019-12-21,ECOM,0.025535905733704567,0.9240069389343262,0.050457220524549484

dropship,Is it wrong to offer micro-influencers discounted products instead of free products?,"This question really made me doubt about what kind of influencer marketing I would like to enroll. Let me quickly explain the situation. We would like to use influencer marketing, but we unfortunately don't have the budget to spend it on influencers.

I'm also a bit sceptic on using micro influencers. In the 1st month of our launch we selected 20+ models (0.8k - 3K followers) , spending a 200€‚¬ in total. Result: 3 out of 20 managed to send me pictures of them wearing our products. And only 1 of them had pictures that were good enough to share. It also took a lot of time and effort to keep following up in order to get them started promoting.

Are they the one's to blame? Yes and no. I probably should've spend more time in building relationships and ask how they promoted other brands before. Should I have worked with a contract? Don't know, the amount is too small to start fighting about.

Anyway, this made me a little bit sceptic about using micro influencers and sending free stuff. I saw some other brands that give a 50% discount code to micro influencers. That way they are sure that their money doesn't get wasted. (they probably also make some profit on it. Problem is that I saw people complaining about this, saying that it's a scam.

What are your thought on this? Feel free to share your experience of using micro influencers.",6,8,2019-12-21,ECOM,0.036162201315164566,0.9118262529373169,0.05201157554984093

dropship,"Getting depressed, not converting on google ads.","I found a keyword that has good search volume ( in Europe ) with around 35 000 searches a month if you add up all the keywords, which end up being pretty much the same search queries.

So I'm ranked first on that keyword, when you type the keywords, first thing that pops up is my google search ad.

Sadly, my landing page experience seems to be utter shit and I can't convert. My CTR is good, but my quality score is slowly declining ( currently at 5/10 &amp; 7/10 ).

I'm using hot jar to see how clients are reacting, some of them stay around, read a little bit and leave. Some just scroll at the very bottom and then leave.

I'm really confused on what I should do, I initially launched a campaign, and after getting 40 clicks &amp; no sales (  I immediately disabled the ads and changed my whole copywriting to make it more "" paint point "" based, something that the customer could relate to, and I think I did a pretty good job at doing that. )

Sadly, now I'm at around 80 clicks total, so around 40 clicks since the changes made, and only 1 add to cart &amp; checkout that ended up not converting.

My product is 60€ but has a high perceived value, my competitors are selling theirs at 30-40€, some guys on google shopping ( Me, doing only search ads ), are selling around 80€.

Could anyone help me optimize my landing page? I'm honestly getting depressed. It's been more than a year than I'm doing dropshipping, yet it seems that I cannot figure the way out to be profitable.

dropship,Create a killer Facebook video ads,"Hey guys,

I need your feedback on a software that I would like to build. This tool might help you a lot in your dropshipping career.

As you know, Facebook and Instagram are the main channels to get views and make sales.

We can either promote our product with an image or a video. I notice that videos are generating more clicks and are a big trend in social media marketing.

I have 2 dropshipping businesses and I found it complicated to build a simple video advertising my products.

**So, I was thinking of creating a tool helping dropshippers like us create catchy videos without using editing software.**

This tool will provide commands to create video with the format used by [Nowthisnews](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/news/activists-pressure-whole-foods-over-allyeged-animal-abuse) or [Brut](https://www.brut.media/us/sport/boxing-to-stop-street-violence-aa7b43b5-8c0b-4751-b3d0-2135d5efdb4a).

Here are the main features of the tool:

* Square format video
* Insert video, photo
* Insert caption with style effect (bold, highlight, underline…)
* Insert emojis

All other ideas are, of course, welcome...

I actually hated my biology/anatomy courses the most as I just didn't find rote memorization mentally stimulating or fun. I was so narrow-minded and tunnel visioned on going to medical school that I never really cared to explore other avenues. I mean I did, I just didn't consider them as better options &amp; wasn't even that interested in them. Few weeks ago, my friend introduced me to E Commerce. From this moment, I was hooked.

I've been studying consumer behavior for the past few weeks and I'm freaking addicted. It's so damn interesting how these little nuances can be the difference between a customer going through with that purchase or not.

The products seem awesome but I've not figured out the winning facebook ad since 30.11.2019 and I've already spent US$2,000 on Fb Ad. What should i do ?

I've set up 5 - 8 campaigns following strategy ""1 campaign 1 objective + CBO &gt; 10 ad sets , each with different audience &gt; 2 ad creatives"". I've got several ad sets / audiences with purchase and 2 times ROI from the 5-8 campaigns.

Then, I picked up each winner from each campaign and put them all together under 1 campaign.

The problem is : the previous winners don't convert well or get purchase or same ROI in this new campaign.

Like I have 5-8 campaigns , each winner had 2 times ROI when each of them was in its own ad set.

But when I put them together , the ROI decreased and the previous good ad sets looked worse.

I think if the Ad Set is great. Then, when I put it in a new campaign , it should perform well as well. Then, I can add budget 20% per day to scale it up. But, the ad set in new campaign doesn't work well.

I think i have obtained enough data to feed the pixel and scale up the ad coz i've obtained 37 purchases , 153 add to cart , 5846 view content , 5525 link clicks and spent over US$2000.

I've tried Shopify Facebook Marketing App for Retargeting as well.

shopify,Whole lotta traffic up in here!,"Hey all, 

First post on Reddit here. I'm operating a brand new online store on Shopify for a brand of gummy vitamins I've recently launched. I am driving some traffic via Twitter Ads at a very low PPC. I have about 1/3 of the ""link clickers"" actually loading the page, but I'm still happy with the cost of getting new visitors to the site. Not many are adding items to the cart... is there a good way to capitalize on this traffic before it simply walks away? I'm working on adding a popup when they try to leave the site, is this a good idea? Thought about offering a free giveaway in return for their email. The giveaway would be a 2 week supply of the vitamin of their choice. It would cost me around $2-4 for the gummies and about $3 for shipping, so all in (excluding the ad cost) it would be a $5-7 cost. Curious to know what y'all think.

dropship,Just launched my store,"After 6 weeks of research and then making my store + learning Facebook ads I have launched my store !

I paid an influencer with about 300k followed split between 3 accounts 40 euro for a post and story ad on each account 

And I have 6 assets running on fb set at 7 euro each!

Wish me luck

(DAY 2)         answer to questions 

To everyone who wants to know how I’m getting on. 

Instagram page was really bad! I choose a bad influencer and My product is very  niche so it was stupid even trying to sell it on Instagram. Also my ad needs work. I plan in the next 2 weeks to upgrade the ad....

As for the people saying it’s a bad time. Listen. I’m not here to make money. I want to learn. I want to fail. I know I have an excellent product. I just need to get my targeting right.... Honestly I think with the right product this could be the best time! I honestly learnt 10 times more in the last 2 weeks than I have in the last year researching! Facebook ads don’t scare me anymore. I taught myself how to make a good website, edit images, and even edit videos. Admittedly if I make no sales in the next 24/hr I’ll be down about 200$ but I’m completely ok with that!

Which leads me to my next point... My ads will hopefully go live today (11.00 a.m. in Ireland right now). I’m much more hopeful they will work! I have a budget of about 50 dollars a day.

So for the people who are wondering what’s next! If all goes well I can get a few sales. Unfortunately from there I will have to stop. In Ireland we have very important exams so I will be selling my store! I wanted to get sales first to prove it’s a good product.

Any more questions leave them here. I will reply in the next 12/24 hours !

Hi there and hope you are enjoying the last few days of 2019.

I'm a dropshipping supplier for CBD and Hemp products and manage 100% of branding/labeling, packaging and fulfillment for several successful brands. 

This year has been a big one for me with a few different businesses like [Office Undershirt](https://www.officeundershirt.com) which is shirt designed for people with Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).

While getting to know my customers I realized that many use THC/CBD to help reduce anxiety so I started a company selling CBD/Hemp products which has organically grown to doing dropshipping for several brands, [https://patriotcbd.org/](https://patriotcbd.org/) is a good example. Right now i'm shipping branded orders every day to US customers for the following products:

* CBD Flower
* CBD Pre-rolls
* CBD Tincture/Oil (Full and Broad)
* CBD Gummies
* CBD Gel Capsules
* CBD Balm
* CBD Roll-on
* CBD Pet Treats

As i'm planning 2020, i'm really curious if other people would be interested in a dropshipping solution for these products.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, can you please fill out the form here: [https://hempws.com/](https://hempws.com/)

dropship,Shutting down my store within 24 hours of it being open.,"So I have been doing a lot of thinking and I'm finally ready to admit to myself that my first store has been a failure. However, I have learned so much from this experience that I think it was worth the sleepless nights and grinding and 800 dollars that I have lost. My product was wrist watches, which I know now is very saturated and controlled by only a few major brands. Its literally impossible to compete with Gucci, Omega, and all these other companies without proper funding. My $1,000 dollar budget isn't going to disrupt their million dollar business lol. For others struggling, I want to share the most important thing I have learned, which is DO NOT SELL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE A LOT OF BRAND LOYALTY. For example, if someone wants to buy a phone, the customer is only thinking of two phones, iphone or android, and probably doesn't give a shit about some random phone that someone is selling on their store. This was my mistake by trying to sell watches. When you think of watches, the majority of people think about only the top brands, and didn't care about the watch I was selling. My advice, is to stick with products like water coolers, coffee machines, and stuff like that in which a customer doesn't care what brand they are buying from. (I'm not a dropshipping guru so take my advice with a grain of salt). I am grateful that I realized this early on before I was balls deep and thousands of dollars invested in my store. Hope this helps anyone who is just starting out. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got another store to open.😎",25,10,2019-12-28,ECOM,0.0477980300784111,0.9152792096138,0.03692277520895004
shopify,Step by step order app? (Similar to ordering pizza/buying airplane ticket),"I'm hoping to find an app that enables my customers to go through a selection process with a couple of different steps for a product. The best comparison I can come up with is ordering pizza: choose your crust, now pick a size, change your base sauce?, now add some toppings.

Another example might be purchasing a plane ticket... Choose your dates, next: three different options of classes, next: seat options, what about checked bags?, more add-ons at the end. Each step there are different prices options with upsell opportunities.

Right now I have a series of drop downs to capture all my variations, but I find it lacking. Within each option group there are those upsell/upgrade opportunities. I'd like to have the prices displayed for each option in hopes customers will choose to go higher when they see it is *only* $3 more for the next higher option in step one (as an example).

The price for each combination of variations gets calculated when selected, but this doesn't allow customers to compare prices of different combos very well. They'd have to go through and select a number of different combos, see and remember the price as they select others, and then make their selection.

I know there apps that will add upsells during checkout, and I plan to utilize those, but I need a more product specific process. The closest I've been able to find is the [product builder](https://boldcommerce.com/product-builder) app by Bold. Its limitation is that I need to allow customers to upload a file with their order, and it doesn't seem like the app can handle that from what I've heard from Bold.

Any help or direction is appreciated!

I launched my Shopify store 2 weeks back. And I got my 1st sale in the 1st week😅. I have no previous experience with eCommerce and so, this was my 1st store. As the heading says, I started this store with $0.

How I did it?

I got the default domain Shopify provided. I designed my store with a free theme. I set up PayPal and done.

For the traffic, I set up an Instagram page for my upcoming store. btw, I started this account in November (I kinda knew that gathering  some followers beforehand was the best option in this case). I posted photos of my products captioned ""To be launched on .......... store"" and ""Coming soon on ........... store"". I used stock photos I got from AliExpress.

After chatting with some of my followers directly and confirming that they'll buy, I launched my store . I waited a week and got my 1st sale. As everyone always say, that feeling you get when you see that first sale is not something that could be put into words.

dropship,I made a Firefox extension for generating PDF invoices on AliExpress for my personal needs and now a hundred people are using it every day,"A while ago, I started ordering things from AliExpress to resell them online. Local law required me to have a receipt of my purchases in order to balance the cost with what I earn from resale. Unfortunately, AliExpress did not offer any easily printable invoice at the time and being a fresh starter I didn't want to pay for a third-party service (there's the cost and also a privacy concern).

I did realize though that the order detail website had all the info that would need to go onto the invoice and so I ended up writing a little Firefox extension for scraping the info from the page and putting it into a downloadable / printable PDF document.

And there it is: A local tool, it didn't cost my anything (well beyond some of my own time) and it doesn't share any of my data with third parties.

For December, I've made $4K in sales, and $700+ is benefit. However, I just checked my paypal account and saw that, for every paiements I receive, there is a huge fee of 4-6% per transaction + the fees of 2.5% of when I transfer the money to my bank (I live in France but receive USD paiements on my paypal account). 
In fact I paid more than $250 in paypal fees, for December only! So my real benefit is only around $500 (counted shopify fees and others already).
Is this normal ? Do you guys pay that much fees as well ? It seems so high. I heard that you can open a US bank account in order to transfer the paypal money to it and avoid the 2.5% conversion fees.
Any suggestions ? Thanks",4,9,2019-12-30,ECOM,0.03872251138091087,0.8974557518959045,0.06382174789905548
dropship,Pro tip: Always google your store niche and try to mimic your professional competitors,"Don't try to mimic other dropshipping stores - mimic the corporate stores. For example, if you're selling watches, try to mimic Fossil's website.",10,56,2019-12-31,ECOM,0.053247638046741486,0.9197759032249451,0.026976503431797028
dropship,Hard work does pay off.,"Okay this might seem just like another ""dropshipping success story"" but it's not entirely just that. It's a message for all those people about to give up and throw in the towel. 

I should probably give you guys a little background so here we go. I started my first business reselling sneakers and high end items online after winning $1,500 in CSGO gambling. I took that money and instead of buying something like a dumb 16 year old I decided to invest it in a business. I bought Supreme and a few jordan sneakers and sold enough till I discovered what dropshipping was. I took all the money I made there and invested it into a business which failed. I was 16, broke again and ready to never touch dropshipping again. But I decided maybe it was worth it to give it another shot so after working a shitty minimum wage bagel shop job I open another dropshipping store and failed for a second time. Once again being broke working a shitty job with a shitty boss for shitty pay I took a break.

A year later I went back to dropshipping this time with a partner this shop actually did okay for while but after countless no sleeping nights and 80 hour work weeks as a high schoolers the business was dead again. This is where I took my longest break till 2019.

Now almost 20 I became popular on the internet and actually got a decent amount of money entertaining but I knew I wanted a business and I knew exactly how to do it. I took all the money I earned, got with a new business partner and set off on creating a dropshipping store that would not only bank us an incredible amount of money as teenagers but it would also be automated so we could sit back and enjoy ourselves. After busting my ass for weeks getting no sales and in the same hole I know far to well my partner was ready to give up on the niche. I told him ""No, it's a goldmine. Were so close i can feel it we got to keep digging"". I told him this the night before it happened. The next morning we struck absolute gold. I finally did it. Overnight my networth quintupled, and just like that I was on my way to gaining 3,000 a day in profit and weve held these numbers for awhile now.


Moral of the story or TL:DR, Please do not give up if it looks like your business is dead, chances are you're about to strike gold.


EDIT- I should probably clarify cause a lot of people asked me in my messages. No I run zero ads. It's all influencer marketing / affiliate markets. The more they sell with their discount code the more they make on various social medias.",28,37,2019-12-31,ECOM,0.04880974814295769,0.9231826663017273,0.028007589280605316
shopify,What's behind your success story?,"Hello everyone and Happy New Year! I think this question is more like general e-commerce one, however I know there are many people here that are actually sucessfull.  


So the question is - what's behind your success story? Obviously it's not about Shopify, which is only a tool, a selling platform. I'm also not convinced that dropshipping is one and only way to succeed, as it seems to be a decent solution for US market mostly, where Ali parcels arrive quickly.  


So how did you choose your product(s)? Do you know them, make them, or just sell them? Do you advertise a lot, how much does it cost? Do you have any existing, loyal group of customers, or is more like single purchase store?

shopify,Facebook Ads questions,"Hello,

So I have some facebook ads questions. I'm quite new to the eCommerce business, so any information is honestly appreciated! I started my Shopify business around three days ago, and I want to generate more traffic and conversions to my site.

With that being said, I wanna believe that facebook ads would be best for this. (I'm in the jewelry/necklace niche, so I'm not even sure if FB ADs will even do well with these types of products). I tried paying Instagram theme pages for ads, but I haven't had much success.

I'm not sure on what type of FB Ad campaign I should begin with. For example, should I start with traffic to build up information for FB pixel, or should I first start with engagement (then conversions) so I have more social proof. Or should I just go directly to conversions (I read while researching that going straight to conversions may not be good because FB pixel doesn't have much information?)?

The problem is that I'm working with a fairly low budget, so I don't want to spend a lot of money either.

Any help, tips, and information are very much appreciated as I am still learning how to use FB Ads since I'm still kind of confused!

If you want the URL to my store so you can give me more advice to maybe see why there are no conversions/less traffic, please pm me! Thank you very much.",2,3,2019-12-31,ECOM,0.020840125158429146,0.915756106376648,0.06340372562408447
