ecommerce,Any advice on how to grow?,"I've been in ecommerce for about 3 years now with 2 other partners, the sales for my business peaked last year and has been on a steady decline.

I have been selling my items mostly through Amazon through a combination of FBA and merchant fulfilled orders. I am constantly trying to add new products, keep supply up for continually selling products, but nothing seems to be driving strong results and I can't break above the level of where I am currently at, and it has been this way for almost a year now. Despite being profitable, I am not making significant enough revenue to justify leaving my current job and work full time on this. 

Regarding our operations, we normally ship out our products every Mon/Wed/Fri and put in extra hours on the weekends to try to find new avenues to grow. 

I can't for the life of me understand why my impressions and traffic keeps falling on Amazon, and my attempts to create a separate website and market have been unsuccessful.

I don't want my first product uploads to be from somewhere like Ali Express - I want to work directly with vendors / brands. 

So my question is, do I launch my site with dummy product and THEN contact potential vendors, or skip publishing my site and send them a password to preview my site?

ecommerce,"Best open platform for a small business with 100,000 products?","I'm currently having second thoughts about magento and am early enough into developing that I could still switch.  My problem with it is the version 1 to version 2 transition that's currently happening.  I don't want to develop the whole thing on 1 and have to do a complete migration in a year to version 2.  I'm having trouble with version 2 because there aren't enough affordable themes and extensions.  Plus I've run into so many technical problems with 2 so far and I haven't added a single product or content page.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So I'm looking into switching to something else, but I have no idea what that would be.  Can anyone recommend a platform based on these criteria?  
&amp;nbsp;  
-Support for at least 100,000 products.  
-Good for a small business with only 5 employees to manage.  
-Authorize.net compatible.  
-Self hosted so we have more control.  
-Good performance.  
-Ease of use for the customer.  
-Can handle complex shipping calculation.  
-Preferably open source.

woocommerce,"Enforce a minimum order total, excluding the cost of shipping?","Hello, I'm converting a BigCommerce site over to WooCommerce and have to say, I'm really pleased so far. This is a wholesale site, so I have the following dilemma: The site must enforce a min order total for a customer to be able to check out.

Is this the same concept as drop-shipping?  Would that 10% commission simply be the margin the merchant expects from the sale anyway?

ecommerce,Yet another site review request - any feedback greatly appreciated,"Here's my store: www.nekochii.com

Any site design feedback would be appreciated, but there are more detailed questions below if you are willing. Thank you for your time :'D

**Background**
We're a couple of artists that have been using Etsy to make handmade cat ears for a long time now. We can no longer use Etsy, and decided to use Shopify and make it on our own, without the marketplace that Etsy provides. We have now expanded with not only the cat ear accessories, but also key chains (handmade) and apparel (dropshipped) of our designs.

**Specific Questions**
I completed a website checklist that was posted in November 2016, which I found really handy (link in the comments below). From that checklist spawned the following questions:

* Item 8 - Does our site give you a reason to buy anything? If it does, what are those reasons? If it doesn't, what do you think is missing?

* Item 12 - The checklist suggests having 300 words on the home page - would this apply to my site? In terms of actual content (mainly the sidebar), the number of non-product words less than 100. Do I need to work on this?

* Item 14 - What do you think of our ""About Us"" page?

* Item 17 - Is our site easy to navigate?

* Item 18 - Do I need a pop-up to build our email list? I've always been a little apprehensive about pop-ups. To be honest though, I just close them, rather than bounce out of the site completely.

Thanks again - we're very much newbies to this, and there is so much to learn.",5,5,2017-03-04,ECOM,0.03066084161400795,0.9336281418800354,0.03571099415421486

shopify,Free Shipping Has Become the Norm,"Online retailing continuously becomes more competitive for sellers.  This doesn't mean online retailing is less profitable than any other market place.  What it does mean that (1) You have to evolve your business model and, (2) you cannot ignore reality.

Reasons for offering free shipping:
 - Makes you appear as competitive if not more so than your competitors
 - Huge selling call to action improving overall customer experience
 - For online retailing free shipping is becoming if not already a virtual requirement.

Why is that most people don't understand how to modify their pricing to offer free shipping?  I am not suggesting simply to just not charge shipping costs.  Just assume its now a cost of doing business and that rather than irritating customers with an almost after thought of additional shipping costs at the checkout page which just reduces the overall customer service.

The solution is to modify your product pricing accordingly taking into account:
 - Gross Margins on Sales
 - Average Product Order Value
 - Average # of Products per Order
 - Method of Shipping

Consider the above if you have low conversion rates or an abandoned cart issue.",16,8,2017-03-06,ECOM,0.03648030385375023,0.8698100447654724,0.09370963275432587
shopify,How do Australians have themselves set up in Shopify for shipping?,"Hi, I'm just setting up my store and loving it but have become confused about setting up the shipping area.  

Previously I ran a Wordpress e-commerce site and the shipping was very simple and free (as in there was no cost for apps to do it).  I used Australia Post and all I did in the shipping settings was select that I was using them as my carrier and it figured out my rates for each item (which individually had weight and dimensions set).

Shopify is a massively huge improvement and upgrade from Wordpress but as I said I am confused by the shipping area.  As there does not seem to be any simple way to set it up with shipping.  It looks like if I was in the USA they do have this done the US postal service, FedEx and UPS through shopify shipping but nine of those are of use to me.

I did read up on the area of setting up manual shipping but I'm wondering if there is a more simple plug in way to go.

I looked in the App Store and there seems to be several apps costing $10 a month or more that work with Australia Post but it is not clear what they do or if they will do what I need which is to calculate shipping rates on people's orders.  Ideally it be cool if such an app handled the scheduling of pickups, ordering up postal supplies, tracking, etc.

I have to say that the idea of paying a monthly fee of $10 or higher just to get shipping quotes calculated which I used to get for free is really not something I want to do.

Lastly what is everyone using as from my research there seems to be three main options.

1. Australia Post - has their own supplies, ships internationally, does pickups, web interface a bit lacking in features, 

2. Pack and Send - has their own supplies, ships internationally,  does pickups, web interface a bit clunky, does pick and pack, really geared towards business, great support &amp; service.

3. Sendle - no supplies, does not ship internationally, does pickups, web interface is super slick &amp; integrates with Xero, has a Shopify app coming out, great support &amp; service.",6,6,2017-03-06,ECOM,0.02365264669060707,0.9358676075935364,0.040479809045791626

My business partner and I are the sellers of VagMagic, a homeopathic remedy for common vaginal irritations: 

www.vagmagic.com

Here's our issue: While we're selling a TON of product, wholesale, to women's subscription boxes and have gotten lots of positive feedback, we haven't made that first actual retail sale yet on the site. Our site views are slowly creeping up into the 20-30 unique hits per day range, which we know is low; we expect that the hundreds of women who will receive our product in their subscription boxes will help increase that. We're just a little concerned as to why people aren't buying on their own - especially since we've been offering promotional codes, reaching out to people, etc. 

Our theory is that intimate/personal care products simply require more time/exposure to gain consumer trust, and that we'll earn this trust, plus the retail sales, once the subscription boxes go out and our product review on a major blog is published.

How does the site/SEO/product look? Our bounce rate hovers around 14-19%, average time on the site is just under 2 minutes, if that helps put things into perspective.

I want to hear your opinions on what posts are Yay, and which ones Nay so the mods can start doing a better job keeping content that people want on here and removing that which we don't. 

These new rules will go to a new sidebar, as well as new reporting features. Ideally I'd also like to look into implementing an Automod to help enforce these rules once we get them ironed out, as well as some fixed CSS with an actual submit post button....

Once we have some direction in what is allowed here and what should be posted elsewhere, and get some organization to things, the sub will be a lot more approachable. Consider things like min karma for posts or whether content marketing posts should be removed or just flaired so we can make filters.

It is a huge timesink and that is not even going so far as to mention that there is no way for me to keep up with their current stock levels or if they even discontinue selling the items!

The reason I haven't just straight up abandoned ship is because the prices are really decent AND it's a US based distributor. I am thinking they just grab stuff off Ali in this niche and store it in their own warehouse and offer dropshipping/maybe do amazon themselves. However, they do solve my problem of having products in my niche domestically, allowing me to offer free UPS ground(reasonable shipping times) and still make some net gain for marketing and my time. So if at all possible Id like to figure something out to keep them on my partnered list.

Is there anything else? I've been mulling it over for a couple days now and searching around google for any other ideas, but I'm not seeing anything.
 
It's either
A) manually add TONS of products taking a lot of time

ecommerce,Teach me about inventory management software options (xpost from entrepreneur),"Hi folks,
I've been selling online for years and have always managed inventory manually. The startup that I work for is in the same boat, we just match up delivery quantities with POs and try to manually update our amazon/ebay/volusion numbers weekly. Business has ramped up immensely over the last 6 months and we need to fix this system now.   

I'm in charge of implementing this new process. I don't know what to look for. There are so many options out there, but I don't have experience with any of these programs so I don't know how to compare features and plans other than price. That's another thing, holy shit are they expensive. Is there anything of value under $100/month?

What I think I want:  
-Integration with Quickbooks, Volusion, Shopify, Amazon and eBay  
-Real-time inventory dashboard  
-Enter inbound and outbound shipments (easily enter POs and such, or maybe that part goes in QB?)  
-Can handle 150 skus  
-Appropriate for $1m/yr revenue business

I'm not sure where quickbooks ends and this software begins. So apologies if I'm mixing up functions.  

What else should I be looking for? What do I need to know? Are there different categories of software? What other questions should I be asking? Thanks guys!",5,7,2017-03-10,ECOM,0.02872657962143421,0.9366747736930847,0.03459864854812622

ecommerce,How do I best monetize an educational resource?,"I’ve played an instrument for quite a long time now, and I’ve gotten pretty good at a certain technique. I have put together a bunch of lessons and exercises to help people improve at this particular way of playing this instrument, and would like to publish these in order to create a semi-passive source of income. I’m mainly doing this for the sense of accomplishment, but I would also like to maximize the amount of money I can earn from publishing this resource.

The way I see it, I have a couple of different options, and would like to hear your experiences and/or thoughts on what the best approach might be.

Currently, I’m thinking the best way to publish and monetize this idea is to start a blog that I’ll update regularly with new exercises. From what I’ve read, maintaining a steady stream of updates will help me reach a high ranking on Google, which I think is quite possible in this niche. As a complement to the blog posts, I’m thinking of embedding YouTube videos of the exercises to demonstrate how they should be played, and how they should sound. This would allow my content to be found both via Google and YouTube searches, while also giving me the option to place ads on the blog itself, and the videos as well. I’m also thinking Patreon could be an interesting option to look into with this approach, as well as affiliate marketing.

Another option would be to publish an e-book, and sell it for a couple of dollars. This way I could build a mailing list, which I understand can be useful for marketing and doing additional sales to a customer base that has proven to be interested in what I am selling. However, it might be difficult to demonstrate the exercises via YouTube without giving away the exercises for free, and not using YouTube robs me of a great way of letting people find my content. I’m also thinking that purchasing an e-book is a one-time thing, whereas making all content available for free would allow for returning customers, and in turn, recurring income. Of course, it is possible for me to put together additional e-books and market these to people on my mailing list, but I think I would prefer to publish smaller updates more often, rather than publishing a whole e-book once a year.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this! Thank you for reading!",5,4,2017-03-11,ECOM,0.02285102754831314,0.9302875995635986,0.04686135798692703

woocommerce,Multi-Vendor site - Looking for plugin to send seperate invoices,"Hello and good morning, 

I am currently working on an online shop for a customer of mine. And since she has two different companies, selling different products on the same shop I am currently looking for a plugin that enables me to automatically send multiple invoices (one for each vendors products) to the customer, with a list of the bought items of the corresponding category as well as price + tax + shipment cost and sums, and of course the necessary legal information.  

Right now I am trying out WC Marketplace, which has a purchasable PDF invoice addon. Sadly their customer support seems unable to provide me with a demo site where I can test out its capabilities.  

If anyone has experience with their addon or knows of some other multi-vendor plugin that offers these capabilities I'd be really grateful if you could help me out.  

To sum up, I need a multi-vendor site with two categories (one for each company), where the customer can buy from each category, pays to one central PayPal account, which splits up the payment accordingly and receives two different invoices, containing only the corresponding items of their respective category, as well as any legal information, pertaining to the respective company / products.

While, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and would love to provide the best experience for my customers - including controlling how my customers receive the product. That being said, with little start-up capital (recommended by lean) and a cap of $250 for my assignment, I turned to dropshipping.
While I could continue to add product, wowee its a lot of work cropping and resizing images. Heres where the Minimal Viable Product comes in, I'd like to do a soft launch to see if I'm on the right track and would love for any suggestions in terms of comments related to design, UX, marketing, pricing, promotions and etc. What would work for you?

Any tips, suggestions and orders would be kindly appreciated.

ecommerce,The right way to show your Product for E-Commerce,"I work for an NYC-based studio that specializes in E-commerce photography. 
People regularly ask me how many product shots they need for their website. Or what kinds of shots they should get. 

So I figured I would write a little topline, in case it helps.

First off, you should know the difference between editorial and product shots:

Editorial Photos are more emotionally-driven images that are used further up the conversion funnel. These tend to be seen in marketing materials, on the homepage or on broad category pages (before you drill down to specific products). These shots are more creative - using interesting backgrounds, models, props or showing the product in-use. 

Product Photos, on the other hand, are usually shown on the product detail pages to give enough visual direction to help the customer decide whether to buy, or not. That’s not to say that product shots can’t be used for marketing, etc., these are just basic rules of thumb...

Aside from the regular front, back and top-down shots you see on Amazon, here are 3 other things you should also consider:

1) Focus on the Details. This is the opportunity to reinforce your value proposition, so be sure to capture the unique lining of your jacket, the silver hallmark on your hip flask or the non-greasy texture of your hand cream.

2) Think Tactile. It’s one thing to say “the leather feels unbelievably soft”, and something else to actually show it. Obviously this is very hard to do online, requiring great attention to the product placement and the lighting. This is what separates the okay photographers from the good ones. Be sure to really scrutinize their portfolios before hiring a photographer to see if this is something they’re capable of capturing.

3) Include Scaling Shots. We have learned that giving customers a sizing reference reduces returns by about 5%. Scaling shots are particularly important for jewelry or handbags, where sizes can be so varied. Props are really helpful here - we have used subway cards, iPhones and magazines for scaling cues. And they can also add a little personality too.

As for how many shots you need - well it depends on a) what you’re selling, and b) what your budget is. But if you keep the above in mind, it should hopefully guide you a little.

I hope this helps. Happy to answer questions.

ecommerce,"(Help) Selling a single branded product online, what platform should I use?","Hey guys, need some advice

I'm currently working on a project where I need to develop a website that sells only a single, highly branded product. The only thing the customer can change is quantity that he or she wants to buy.

The product would be sold very locally and the website would mainly serve as a page to present the brand and product. 

The website must be highly stylized and branded and I must be able to focus on the product. I would even see it as a one-page thing.

I am knowledgeable about front-end and back-end programming (currently studying in computer science). I know HTML, CSS, JS quite well but not super familiar with bootstrap, but I am confident that I could pick it up easily after having read the documentation.

Here is what I am considering. I need your thoughts on what would work best.

1. Build front end from scratch and use an API (looking at Shopify API right now). It doesn't seem like my best bet because I do not know anything about that API and I'm pretty sure there are better ways to do what I want considering how simple the project is. However, it would allow me to build a leaner experience for customers.
2. Wordpress integrated with a e-commerce plug-in, currently looking at shopify plug-in. Seems like the easiest solution, but having used Wordpress and shopify both before, both systems in their vanilla state are pretty cluttered. Wordpress is best used for blogs and shopify has the UI designed around stores selling multiple product with different variants and sizes. However, I've heard of people doing great things with those platforms, but I do not know where to start and any advice would be appreciated.
3. Use wix w/ an e-commerce plug-in. I've used Wix multiple times already and I loved how easy it is to come up with something quickly. However, I am unsure about the e-commerce aspect.

In all, I'm basically looking for a platform / plug-in combo that would suit my needs. Furthermore, if Wordpress seems to be the popular choice, then I would also be interested in knowing how I can move away from that ""blog"" structure that seems prevalent by default.

Best wishes,

We just wanted to extend a big thank you to those who helped review our shopify store, www.vagmagic.com, to see why wholesale sales were great, but retail sales were lacking. The biggest suggestion was to show a picture of the product itself - which was a total 'duh!' moment for me and my business partner once we realized we were missing such a thing! We set to work to take a picture of our capsules and post them on the front page, rework the website to look better, etc. Later that night, within hours, we had a retail sale! The best part? This person found us through an organic search on Google and bought product within 4 minutes. No ad needed. We 1000% believe it was because we had the proper photos and copy right on the landing page.

ecommerce,"Tired of stewing over finding the ""right"" niche. Advice?","I want to get into ecommerce. I would one day love to be my own boss. Yes, I am aware that building an online business is a pretty difficult thing to do, it takes A LOT of hard work, patience, and to a certain extent, luck. But I want to at least try.

The only thing that makes me crazy is the idea of finding the perfect ""niche"", something that is repeated over and over and over again. I understand what it is and I understand the reason why you would need to, but so far, I can't for the life of me even come close to deciding on what to choose. For one thing, most resources on helping you to find a good niche are extremely vague, and they say things like ""make a list of the needs of your family and friends; what products might they be interested in purchasing that they don't already have?"" And I'm thinking, um....""fuck if I know!"" I mean, if my friends and family don't have something, they're going to go on Amazon and find it because Amazon has everything.

They are all telling you that you need to find this one product that everyone will go nuts for, but that no one else is currently selling...how the fuck is that possible in this day and age? For any one product that you can think of to sell, a million other people are already selling it most likely. 

So that leads me to the question I always ask: is worrying about finding the perfect niche even necessary? Say that I love zombies. Millions of other people do too. Can't I just take that and turn that into a business and just try something like that? 

I feel that if I force myself to stay within the very strict parameters that all of these experts give, that I'll never choose a niche because it's like finding a needle in a very vast haystack.

SO THEN..........When it came time to place the orders with AliExpress. I logged in, entered my prepaid credit card number and placed a couple orders. Then I decided to use my paypal credit card and made a couple more. Then I get a MOTHERFUCKING error message saying that My order is APPEALED. ITs this insanely complicated process that they have for orders that are a security risk. I had to submit a pic of my License and a pic of my card and a statment.

I've just had my Worldpay account approved. I now need a gateway for my site. There are plenty to choose from including the one from Woo itself. 

I am selling in Turkey using Turkish Lira. Now, when I test checkout via paypal, the currency you will pay in will be Turkish lira. But since paypal is banned in Turkey, I need to use paypal. 

The currency in my shop is TL but in a 'Test' mode of one of the gateways I'm using, it says 'settlement currency' and i've only got the choice of the  major currency $ £ Euro etc... 

When my customers checkout will they be 'redirected' and it will cause them to pay in the 'settlement currency' or will it act like paypal and complete the transaction in the native currency and then exchange it to my currency into my worldpay account? 

Anyone got any experience with this? 

Basically i'm selling in one currency and my WP account is another currency. Will the customer pay in their currency and i'll recieve in mine? 

Sorry if this isn't clear, but i'd love to resolve this before I commit to worldpay with a paid plugin.

ecommerce,Discount Strategy for Email sign ups and Brand,"(From /r/Entrepreneur) I'm selling cheap products that are around $10-$30. I want to give a big 70% discount to get people's foot in the door, so to speak, and have repeat customers. I would get their email and they get a 70% coupon.

Is this a bad idea since they'll always expect this type of discount all the time (like in email marketing) or is it ok for the first time/their first purchase Only just to get them involved with my brand and comfortable.

I know that if a customer buys from you once, they're much more likely to buy from you again but I don't know if my strategy is flawed from the start with a huge coupon. Should I still offer a coupon but go lower? Say 25% or 30% off instead?

If you sell cheap products in the price range of $10-$30, what has worked for you?

Site has been up for 37 days (Shopify), has done just over $3500 in sales. Overall its sitting at 5.5% ATC/2.5% RCO/1.5% Purchase. Profit after all expenses so far is @ $700. 10 days ago I greatly reduced the products listed (by about 70%) to just what is selling and refocused my advertising &amp; website theme to focus on those products (wasted a lot of $$ on advertising on stuff that didn't sell). Now, in the last 7 days it has $1000 sales with 10% A.T.C/5% RCO/3% Purchase and 20% of profit going towards advertising. The products are drop shipped off Aliexpress with on average 90% markup.

dropship,Shopify keeping 25% of my sales because I dropship from China.,"""The reason your account is deemed as higher risk is because you appear to be drop shipping from China. As you are aware, this increases shipping times to almost a month or more in some cases. As some customers are not accustomed to this shipping time (a normal timeframe is 3-7 business days), your chargeback risks are increased.

That said, we are going to set a 25% reserve (25% of all sales) that will be held for 90 days in order to mitigate this chargeback risk. At the end of 90 days the reserve rule will be released as long as your chargeback rates are under 1% on a month-to-month basis.

In the meantime, your Shopify account will remain active and you are free to switch to any other gateway if that is more convenient for you.

Regards,""

I completely understand that dropshipping is not the best business model, but I have seen so many people make some money on it. I plan to save any profits made to establish a business and make my own products.

Currently, I have 2 Facebook ads running. One that promotes my best product with a attention grabbing photo and a call to action link to my store (Wooden Sunglasses) and the other Ad, offers a chance to win a $50 in-store voucher if they like the page, comment and share the post (with a call to action link to the store aswell). My ad budget is $10 a day and my campaign is very targeted towards the relevant audience.

Since I've had my Ads running, I have received a lot of positive feedback in the comments regarding the products on the store and it has been shared 61 times. My page likes went from 0-61 in 2 days but no sales have been made.

What am I doing wrong? I have researched the Niche and seems to be growing nicely. I understand there may be a fair bit of competition but my prices are pretty good and my website design seems to be good too (I think so anyway).

Could someone please guide me in the right direct? Feel free to tell me that i'm wasting my time with this store, if more experienced redditors have an criticism, it is more than welcome. Please feel free to pick it apart and tell me if there is anything I can improve on or not doing correctly.

ecommerce,Need help with starting a business,"Hi,
I have around 4000 dollars to invest in business. I'm located in Europe and I am stuck. My idea was to start an ecommerce business with simple webshop and facebook page. Problem is I don't know how to do marketing for webshop or facebook page. I don't have a specific niche of products more like all around shop where you can find anything for anyone and the selling point should be the prices. I can maintain low prices of products even lower than competitions. Plan is to sell only nation wide (locally) for starts. I know lots of you will say you have to have a niche etc. but I simply don't have the ""balls"" to specialize for niche. I think that with wider product selection you can have wider selection of potential buyers and with that at least something will sell.

I need advices, guidlines, help, anything to get me started. I simply don't know where to start. Currently I'm in process of opening the company, webshop design is done and thats it. Im stuck I don't know what to do next how to organize myself, how to do marketing, how to ""sell"". I know that this text is a little short of information but that is what I have currently. Any help or advice is more than welcome. It's my last money to invest and I need to be careful with it. I don't expect any profit in next 2 months from beginning but I need to have some comeback after that time. Currently my monthly company expenses are :
Employment: 90$
Book keeping: 90$
Bank: 30$
Other nation taxes etc: 100$

shopify,To those who have no traffic and sales,"Not getting traffic and sales on your Shopify Store?  I see this type of ""help me"" on the forums.

Based on all of the stores I've worked on, here are the typical issues causing the problem (assuming whatever product or service is a viable competitive product):

1. No traffic is a reflection of your marketing and not of your website site itself. So if you have no traffic the problem lies with you not reaching out and getting the attention of the potential customers properly. So if you're not getting traffic working on your website likely will not significantly help. You need to work on your marketing.

2. No sales is a function of problems with your website, products, or a combination of the two. High bounce rates usually indicate poor layout and presentation. Low conversion rates usually reflect a combination of lack of conveying value proposition, building customer trust, and a website that is not easy or enjoyable to use.

Understanding and using analytics is absolutely necessary in resolving problems with your website.",2,14,2017-03-26,ECOM,0.27058979868888855,0.7004228234291077,0.02898743934929371

My thoughts now is.. setup a web store and share the links in Instagram and Facebook when I am promoting specific product.

shopify,Theme Development/Third Party,"Hey all--

If I were a developer, I'd be spending my days developing a Shopify theme creation tool. Much like Gempage (https://gempage.getshoplaunch.com/). 

I'm wondering if anyone is familiar with third party theme developers who are developing using Shopify's sections. 

I'm looking for a theme with lots of options. Something you can actuqlly customize. Say, with sections that contain a ""Divi"" (wordpress theme) type quality. 

This is the direction Shopify seems to be heading. - however slow - in its theme development. I'm wondering if anyone is almost there. Also of other Gempage-like projects besides Shogun.

Thanks!

**EDIT:** For those out there struggling with themes, I'm talking to the creator of [Gempage](https://gempage.getshoplaunch.com/) now. It's pretty cool. I'm tempted. It's sorta like Webflow... kind of.",6,3,2017-03-31,ECOM,0.025434551760554314,0.9322441816329956,0.04232129082083702

woocommerce,Need Variable Pricing Help...,"Hello!  One of my clients has an E-Commerce shop setup utilizing WooCommerce on Wordpress.  They offer clothing products which are often times the same, but different pricing for different sizes.  I believe WooCommerce calls it the ""Product Archives"", or the place that you can click into a category and see all product listings for that category listed, we want to show the pricing there from a specific size for all t-shirts.   So for example, currently, it shows the pricing for all size XXL shirts, but we want the price to be shown from all size Medium shirts.  How would we change that?  

I have read many things online and I have found code to put in the functions page to show a price, instead of a range, but I havent found code to show a specific price, from a specific variable on all listings. 

Thoughts?
