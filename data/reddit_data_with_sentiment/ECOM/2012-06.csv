ecommerce,Google's Trusted Store program will hurt customers and Merchants alike.,"Google is taking its Trusted Store program to the mainstream and offering it up to all online merchants and changing what has historically been a free service (Google Merchant Center / Google Shopping feeds) to a paid CPA system. This is being done under the premise that it will help shoppers in finding reliable and reputable sellers online as well as provide a new level of protection to both customers and merchants. The truth is anything but.

Starting with customers. Google claims that search results will become clearer and more reliable because forcing merchants to pay for the data they upload will encourage them to provide better data. The reality is that your shopping results will become restricted to only those sellers who are able to afford to compete in the bidding war for your business. This of course means that you can also expect them to pass on additional costs to you to cover their new marketing costs. Everything you purchase online will become more expensive.

If a customer decides to opt in to the Trusted Store program, Google will be stepping in as an arbitrator to settle any disputes that cannot be easily resolved between the customer and merchant. Google will have the power, for example, to force a merchant to refund the customer or risk losing their status as a Trusted Store. In order to be able to do this effectively Google is requiring ALL order data including customer information, order information, tracking data, and order cancellation data be transmitted to Google for all online orders processed by the merchant. Google will then use this data not only to solicit feed back from customers regarding their shopping experience, but also to farm data to be used in their own marketing and ad delivery strategies to each each and everyone of the merchant's customers.

The ""protection"" that Google is offering is nothing that all online shoppers don't already get from virtually every credit card company and Paypal. The data farming on the other hand will be used in ways that only Google can to influence their online experience and modify the kind of advertising they are exposed to. Shoppers beware, if you buy from a Google Trusted Store, everything you give them is being given directly to Google.

Regarding merchants, as stated above, what has always been a free service will now be a paid one. Your costs will go up. Not only that, but you will find your business subjected to new tight regulations by a third party that has no idea how your business works. In order to maintain your status as a Trusted Store (a requirement for eligibility to even use Google Shopping) you will have to maintain very specific standards of performance as set forth by Google. If you can't live up to the standards, you lose your status. You lose your status, you can't advertise on Google Shopping. You lose Google shopping, your sales drop.

The fact is that you will be lucky to get out this without losing sales as it is. Assuming you keep up a status as a Trusted Store, you will be clearly labeled to all customers with a big sign on your head that reads ""Everything you tell me, I tell Google.""

ecommerce,Looking for an ecommerce mentor.,"I'm smart, learn fast, am semi-technical (I do a lot of work on my website[HTML, CSS, install widgets and modify/replace code, but sometimes hire out a programmer), and I'm growing my ecommerce business, which is doing well enough to sustain me. I really feel as though I could use some guidance on what to pay attention to, marketing avenues/tools, analytics metrics to watch, and other things as they come along. 

I ask for help because I'm relatively young (24/m) and this is my first ecommerce business. I'm currently using Magento and a backend software, and am using Goolge Shopping as a main way to get my products in front of people's eyes, other than organic search/optimization. If you just have a quick word of advice, I'm definitely willing to take it! If you have time for more, I'd be very appreciative and would be willing to return the favor in any (inexpensive) way that I can. Let's be real--not exactly getting rich over here :)

ecommerce,Two Questions,"1) This is for work. I've used and managed an ecommerce at my previous job, and I just got a new job and soon I will be re-doing their WHOLE website, pretty much from top to bottom. Their store right now, is horrible, they had some guy build it from scratch and its terrible. 

So I had presented them the idea of wordpress (for the main site), and an ecommerce for the store. They just told me to take care of it (they have no clue). So my question is, I'm looking for an Ecommerce software, that also has matching templates for wordpress. I've seen PrestaShop, and some one created 'Velvet Sky' its a template for wordpress, and PrestaShop. 

I should also say, my job title is not just webmaster, I do other stuff so I don't have time to modify other templates to make one work etc. 

Secondly, 

I'm looking into starting my own online store..I however, am not sure where to go to find a wholesale/distrubtor. Can anyone point me in the right direction.

ecommerce,Changing platforms with a substantial existing site,"So I'm a web/graphic designer working for a small, but very profitable and catalog apparel company. The website is older, built in 04-05 on a basically proprietary ASP platform that has only been updated when they've asked and paid for this e-commerce company to make the change. 

The backend is atrocious, the pages are written in tables and getting our current company to do the updates we want is both expensive and frustrating. 

I'm pushing for us to re-platform next year to something that we will have control over and possibly even host ourselves. I've been in talks with a guy from Magento, but doing a little poking around Reddit has show that a lot of programmers despise working with Magento.

So I ask you, /r/ecommerce, what platform would you recommend for a small-medium size business? The features I'd like to have are:

* The ability to have a separate store for our wholesale customers with different products and pricing that is only accessible via login (Think Magento's Private Sales)
* Written in PHP and HTML5

ecommerce,Launching E-Commerce site where free prizes are used as promotions: what are the most desirable prizes?,"Hey everyone,

I am part of a team that has been working on a website for the past 14 months. We are currently entering the final stages, and hoping to launch within the next 2 moths. Our demographic is largely young internet users who are interested in gaming and gambling, because of this I think Reddit is a great place for us to seek advice.

Without going into too much detail a major component of the website involves running sweepstakes/raffles. At launch we plan to have 1 ""big-ticket"" item and then around 6 smaller items. The big-ticket item will be valued at around ~$55,000 with the smaller items valued between $100-$350. This is where I need your help, on deciding these items.

Currently the big-ticket items we are considering are either a 2013 Porsche Boxster or a 2013 Mercedes SLK 55 AMG (the car enthusiasts' 2 door convertible sports car). If you had a choice between the two which would you choose? If neither appeals to you, feel free to post another car in this same price range as an alternative (nothing more than $75K). Furthermore, if a car is not a prize that you care about at all, post an item within the same price range which you would prefer, and that would ideally appeal to multiple demographics.

For the smaller items we are looking for opinions on what we should offer. Some examples of prizes we are currently considering offering are: Xbox 360 ($350), Bose Headphones ($300) and an Apple TV ($100). With these three items in mind, it would be great if you could offer some further suggestions of items in this same price range that would interest you.

Thanks in advance for your help!

dropship,Does anybody know of a good tea drop shipper?,"I have a domain name which ranks well on Google for a tea related keyword. That domain name also has several semi-popular blogs that link back to it. And I have about $100 left on my ad words account from a coupon code I had used a few month back. The site is getting about 10 visitors a day and I feel like I'm wasting it by just letting it sit there without an online store.

I'm looking for a good blind drop shipper for tea. The only one I've found is called Lotus Tea House and the only reason I plan on using them is because I can't find a better option. Can someone point me in the right direction?

TL/DR: Does anyone know of tea drop shippers or have any experience with the Lotus Tea House?",0,2,2012-06-27,ECOM,0.03580591455101967,0.9251126646995544,0.039081424474716187

dropship,What do you look for from a dropshpper?,"Hi Reddit dropshippers! I'm currently working for a redesign/rebrand of a large eCig distributor. I've been following this sub a bit since I saw the AMA and managed to convince the owner of the company to start dropshipping! He's got a bit of a niche in the market so it will be very interesting once we get the ball rolling. I have no real experience with dropshipping though so I have a few questions for you guys:

* What do you expect from a dropshipper (any sort of control panel or anything like that?)
* Do you usually require both product descriptions and images?
* In terms of the API, which platforms should it integrate with?
* Is there already any good software out there that I'd be able to set up for him?",1,9,2012-06-28,ECOM,0.10175255686044693,0.8757492899894714,0.02249813824892044

dropship,"Hey dropshippers, my friend makes one-off jewellery - mostly fancy beadwork - and I'm wondering if this is something she can drop-ship for people?","The jewellery is quite nice and fairly good quality. I'd have to check, but she could probably make a ""stock"" design and drop-ship them.

I'm thinking of this because she's doing the craft shows and not selling much (when the show doesn't get cancelled) plus going the etsy-route is mired in family politics, which I'm staying out of.

Possibilities?
