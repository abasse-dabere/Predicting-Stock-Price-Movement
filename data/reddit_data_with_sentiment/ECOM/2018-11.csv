dropship,How to make your Facebook Dynamic Ads stand out,"Are you ready for Black Friday/Cyber Monday?

Advertising your product during this period means **high competition in the auction and high CPMs**. If you are using **Dynamic Ads** ( see a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/9b04tr/if_you_arent_using_dynamic_product_ads_you_are/) on why you should get on the ""Dynamic Ads"" train... yesterday!), you will love this new feature that allows you to customise the appearance of your Dynamic Ad AND **show extra information**. This means that even though there are other people selling the exact products like yours, a **template will make them start out**. 

The short version is you can create a frame/border on an image-editing software (ex. Photoshop) and then applied it on the ad level. That's it! All the products will be shown with the added template (see [Image](https://newsfeed.org/wp-content/uploads/Applying-template-to-dynamic-ad.png)). 

The process is super simple and straight-forward and allows you to display dynamically (percentage off, sale price and current price, and more - see the image above). The feature may not be available to everyone but to those that have access, they will surely see an increase in their CTRs and conversion rates. 

You can read our guide on how to create and apply a template [here](https://newsfeed.org/how-to-make-your-facebook-dynamic-ads-stand-out-with-creative-templates/).

&amp;#x200B;

**GIFT**: We have put together a bundle with [Black Friday and Cyber Monday inspired templates in .png](https://m.me/newsfeedmag?ref=GIFT%3A%20DPA%20template) format that you can apply immediately to your Dynamic Ads. It is completely free to use!

dropship,Can someone validate my idea?,"Hey guys,

I've been drop shipping for over 8 years now, not making a lot but enough to keep it running. I wrote my own scraper last year to just so I can grab a few products from distributors --automatically. Today, my program can find over 1000+ products in 3 minutes based on your keyword, and negative keywords. At the moment I'm in the middle of finalizing (Designing) the desktop program so anyone can use it, grab 1000+ products with descriptions, images, and even price that you can set to markup. With this baby you can create an eCommerce website in less than 10 minutes.

So my question is, would you be interested in this tool? and if yes, what other features would you like to see? and if not, why not?

Alright guys thank you for the input, feel free to share this with any other subreddit so we can get more ideas:

&gt;So far for feature set these are the things I'll be working on:
&gt;
&gt; * A form of VPN to prevent IP blocking
&gt;
&gt; * Use ""evergreen best items to dropship"" methodology to find the best products to sell
&gt;
&gt; * ""Supplier"" based item scraping (I might hold off on this for now)",23,16,2018-11-02,ECOM,0.041903991252183914,0.9245005249977112,0.03359553962945938
shopify,Suspicious orders from Thailand - ship or not to ship?,"In the past week I’ve received two decently large orders from Thailand. Both are for the same $85.99 product and use shipping methods that are around $75 (usps international options)

First order passed fraud filters and the buyer responded to my email asking them to confirm they really wanted this item.  I even suggested there may be cheaper places in their own country to purchase it.  

I received a new one this morning for TWO of this item but this one has intermediate risk due to no CVV on the credit card. I’ll reach out to them as well.

It’s not impossible that these are actual orders. I have decent SEO for this product and it is a hot item. It’s a collectible toy that is just now hitting the market.  I mean of course I want these orders to be real it just seems way too suspicious to me. It’s mostly due to the shipping charges. The average person buying collectibles like this is very shipping cost adverse.

I’m just not sure what I can do other than email them, communicate, and then decide whether or not to ship

I am using bold commerce cashier app as well.  Has anyone else received a rash of orders like this?

UPDATE
Thanks to all the thoughtful advice.  My first order’s customer responded again and has sent me a photo of their cc and photo I’d. I think it’s 100% legit. The second order I have received nothing so far in response to my emails. It is most likely a fraudulent order and I’ll have to refund it. I’ll update when I find out more.

UPDATE 2
both orders have been received by the buyers. It appears these were BOTH legit orders!  I’ll still give it time because a chargeback could still be possible but I have confirmation that the orders were delivered in Thailand even though I could not confirm the addresses in Shopify. The lesson here is to watch your orders closely and do not immediately assume fraud.  Correspond with you customers and be honest and polite. I made my customers ship EMS so it was expensive and they were willing to pay",27,12,2018-11-02,ECOM,0.07999437302350998,0.884926438331604,0.03507918119430542
ecommerce,Planning Ecommerce Store and Numbers Don't Add Up,"Hi,

Could someone please help clarify that my numbers are correct? These seem like industry standard values but they always result in a loss. I'm calculating profitability of Paid Ads.

If I pay £2 / million impressions, have a 0.5% click through rate, and a 2% conversion rate.
My AOV is £22, of which 40% of that is profit.

If I get 10,000 views (costing £20), resulting in 50 clicks and 1 order.
The profit from that order is £8.80 (22*0.4).

So I've spent £20 to make £8.80 after product cost is taken out, a loss of £11.20.

Now, from what I've stated in that last paragraph...have I made the supplier's CSV file useless? Is there some kind of workaround? (I'd basically just like to use it for inventory levels) Am I better off/would it be easier just to add everything manually?

shopify,“Shopify Mentor” Scammer: Ben Newcombe; @ecomexpressben on IG; www.ben-business.com,"(Its my first post on this page so i apologize if i am not in the right section or “flair”)

So I recently purchased a Shopify personal mentorship course from Ben Newcombe, a “Shopify mentor” from Europe (I think UK because he referred to GMT as his time). I initially trusted him and thought he was legit because he had about 14k followers at the time, frequently posted his Shopify profits and monthly revenue, and just recently set up a website. I paid $195 for his course. In this course, he offered offered personal help on store layout and ads for as long as you needed. We spoke through kik and it usually took him around a day to answer my messages. That was extremely frustrating. Looking back on this experience, I realize that he never really provided any valuable help to my store. No advice or tips. Just “yes!” And “no!” To answer my questions. That lack of care initially made me skeptical of him. I asked him to help me with  setting up and ad and that’s when he started distancing himself. It took him a day to respond to my request for help on FB ads and when i started going point by point in  the ads, he suddenly stopped responding. I messaged him over the next 2 weeks, hoping he had just temporarily lost access to his account, but then I realized he had blocked me. Shortly after, I couldn’t find his kik account when I looked it up on the app. I went to visit his Instagram to ask him what was going on, but he had changed his username. Neither his name nor kik username rendered any results on IG. I tried emailing him two or three different times asking him what was going on. No response. Just today, I went through my following list and found an account named “@ecomexpressben”. Bingo. I went to his last post and told him to respond to my DM immediately to resolve this issue. I DM’d him that he disappeared and I needed an explanation for the blocking and ignoring he did. He blocked me off his Instagram and saw the DM, but didn’t respond. 
What should I do next to get my money back? Is there even a way to do that? He seems extremely legit, but it’s all just a trick I guess.. 

Overall, my point of posting this is just so you all can be aware of this fake, piece of sh*t and know not to buy from him. Let me know if you have an answer to any tips or advice. Thanks, and good luck to you all",42,24,2018-11-03,ECOM,0.07054626196622849,0.8905794024467468,0.03887432813644409

dropship,"Selling Halloween ""apparel"" post-season","So I bought a ton of stock for an item and sold it all so i'm not worried about that specifically. 

That being said, a lot of people that bought the product (and others VERY SIMILAR) made the purchase for things besides halloween like raves and what not. 

For a reason (that I won't get into detail here), I had to shut down all ads even before my cut off for halloween shipping times, so I can't JUST keep the ads that had been working alive since they're turned off right now. Furthermore I feel like creating new ads would be better so I can better format the ad copies (that I test out) to better fit post-halloween.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I want to keep going with this is because even after i halloween, people are still hitting up my store to buy the product(s) for raves/festivals and just to have in general as the product(s) were actually pretty big even in the summer months in the US/CA among other tier 1 countries in the northern hemisphere. 

So my question is, should I 

1. have an EARLY black friday sale and gear my ads that way?
2. have an EARLY christmas stocking stuff/present sale and gear my ads that way?
3. Change my ads and adsets  to rave/festival theme and sell them to almost summer countries like AU 
4. keep the same ad template and turn on the ads that were already working and see where they go?

ecommerce,Magento 1.x and Apple Pay,"We have an online store running Magento Community 1.9.x right now and using PayPal PayFlow Pro to accept PayPal and credit card payments on site.

We want to add Apple Pay as a payment option, so we reached out to Stripe and found after negotiating (and by accident) that Stripe does not refund transaction fees when returns for refund are processed, so we always end up losing the X.X% transaction fee should a client return their order. This would amount to significant losses, so we dropped them. It was a major bullet-dodged as it was on an annual contract.

Is there a way to maintain PayPal PayFlow Pro and add another payment method (another supplier) for Apple Pay payments in Magento? Or are we restricted to using 1 supplier for all payment types?

Is anybody running PayPal as their main payment processor and currently offering Apple Pay also? 

I should also mention that I am aware Braintree (a PayPal company) offers Apple Pay option....and after digging around with them, we discovered it's the same issue as with Stripe, unfortunately.

ecommerce,"If you are selling to UK customers, use this advanced tip","Hi guys, I just want to share a quick tip for anyone who has an ecommerce store who is actively targeting British consumers and want to grow British ecom sales. The UK market is very lucrative if you know what you are doing. I have been reading a lot of posts from people asking about reviewing their stores and how to increase sales but one of the biggest issues I am noticing from some people is sometimes **a lack of sales comes from lack of having a strategy**. 

This is what you do: you look at how much your competitors are making, you read their financial statements and annual reports in detail to understand the challenges and positives of the commerce category that you want to work in. Then you create your marketing strategy around what you have learned. 

Luckily in Britain, you can actually see a lot of private companies' financial statements and accounts because many of them are posted online on Companies House's website for free. 

This strategy only works if you are targeting British consumers (you can extrapolate for the Republic of Ireland as well)

1. Go to Companies House beta (yeah guys you know I can't link it so just Google it)
2. Search for the company that you are trying to research. For example, I wanted to see Boohoo's sales as they own Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing which are 2 very aggressive fashion ecommerce brands. 
3. Go on the company's website and find their registration number if you want as well
4. The company listing comes up, you go to the filing tab and choose the documents you want to look at
5. Boohoo has listed its full accounts (the company is public on the stock exchange) and it has also included a strategic report. A lot of companies that are private without being floated on the stock exchange post detailed financial statements so it just depends on the company you want research on. 
6. Read the financial statements and auditor's report (if it is there) to get an idea for what your competitor is doing, how the market for your e-commerce category is and look for whether they are making a loss or not to determine how cash-intensive your e-commerce space is. 
7. Retool (if necessary) your marketing strategy around what you have learned from the financial facts in the financial statements of your key competitors. 

**What does this advanced strategy even teach me?**

For fashion ecommerce stores targeting Brits, just a simple look on Boohoo's financial statements has them citing their huge fashion success due to ''social media influencers, bloggers, TV, email, students and digital acquisition channels'' (their words). So no need to reinvent the wheel - just do what is currently working for the big movers in your space and adapt it to your audience. From this key take away for example, I was surprised that Boohoo mentioned the power of students so this means they are focusing hard on galvanising university students to buy. 

There's another store called Everything 5 Pounds that used to be quite successful. A quick look at their Companies House accounts showed £28m in revenue from selling fashion garments for just £5 yet they actually made a loss and they took cash out of the business to prop up another business (!). So what you can see from that is it costs a lot of money to sell affordable clothing online so you really need to be good at managing money instead of being like this company. 

A quick peruse of MissGuided's financial statements found millions and millions of pounds in turnover yet the companies' retail stores are making the company lose money. So the moral of this story is keep it simple and stay focused on what makes money (ecommerce) instead of going too deep in bricks when your customer base lives online. 

\--- 

I realise this type of detailed analysis isn't for everyone but the point is if you want your e-commerce store to make money, you need to realise you don't exist in a silo, and **you need to create a strategy that makes financial sense**, not just what you and your friends think is cool. If you have a Christmas themed store, Google all of the specialised Christmas stores on Companies House and see what their finances are saying because their financial stability will teach you the mistakes you need to avoid for your Christmas business. 

I only started succeeding in e-commerce and digital marketing when I took strategy and research seriously. Good luck everyone!",5,10,2018-11-06,ECOM,0.04217249155044556,0.9279904961585999,0.029837075620889664

ecommerce,PSA: eBay provides no seller protections,"*(Also posted this on* /r/ebay*)*

As of this summer, eBay has a new policy regarding seller protections in the case of fraudulent returns or other edge cases. Prior to this, eBay would unofficially cover you for these by issuing a reimbursement from their corporate account. Apparently they were taking too big of a loss due to fraud, and decided to offload all of this onto buyers and (mostly) sellers. (If you call in and ask about this, they will give you a spiel about how eBay is a business and they have to make money, and your business should build these losses into your margins).

&amp;#x200B;

With this new policy, eBay will not, under ANY circumstances, cover/reimburse the seller for:

\- Empty box returns

\- New-&gt;Old replacement returns (the old 'switcharoo'), or where the buyer clearly used an item

\- Carrier issues with a package (stuck-in-transit-4-lyfe)

\- Any other case that they can skimp out on

&amp;#x200B;

It was never eBay's official policy to cover sellers on these types of issues, but in the past, I've had every single one of them covered with a fairly easy phone call or two. Now, eBay has decided that it's the seller's problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I have several problems with this:

\- eBay never communicated this clear removal of seller protections

\- eBay framed this move as a positive move, by highlighting the new ""free returns"" policy, where you (as a seller) could deduct up to 50% of a buyer's purchase price from a return -- but only if you offer free returns. This effectively splits \*any\* buyer/seller dispute between the buyer and the seller, and eBay is cleverly bowing out of any financial compensation for these. They fail to mention that, all of a sudden, you have zero protections against fraud now (as a seller). The \*most\* that you can hope to get back from a fraudulent return is 50%, and that's only if you offer free returns for everybody else.

\- eBay has effectively changed our terms, eliminating any recourse/protections we used to have, all while taking the same fees from us -- i.e. decreasing the value of their platform, but keeping the price the same.

\- Going forward, eBay has no real incentive to thwart fraudulent buyers. Prior to this, they had a direct, strong financial incentive to stop these guys since eBay was usually on the hook (unofficially) for the empty box (and similar) returns. I strongly suspect that, as we get further down the road, eBay will de-prioritize the effort of finding/catching fraudulent buyers since there is no direct financial impact anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

With the way that eBay representatives all talk about this, it's clear that they've had very targeted training on what to say when this issue is brought up. They all say the exact same things, and then suddenly start repeating all their lines when the script runs out. ""eBay is a business and we need to cut our costs"", ""We shouldn't be held responsible for these problems that are outside of our control, since we're just a platform"", ""You need to build these types of things into your business' margins"", etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I wanted to throw this out there and make sure that everyone knows what you're getting into if you're thinking about selling on eBay. I'm going to run some numbers tonight for my own business to see how much eating all the fraud-related costs is going to hurt. It sucks because one fraudulent purchase/return can eliminate 50+ sales, especially since the fraudulent purchases are typically higher-dollar items.

&amp;#x200B;

ecommerce,"Best method to build a ""self-quote"" system?","Hello guys,

I'm looking for ideas on how to meet a specific request for a small wholesale business of cleaning supplies. Currently, in order to receive a quote, the customers select the products they're interested in from the website (https://nacionaldeaseo.com/catalogo) and send emails or texts with their list of products, which the salespeople then capture in the POS system and email them their quote.

We'd like to make this system more efficient by building what we're calling a ""self-quote"" system, in which the prices of products will be published in the site, and the customer could add them to a list and at the end print out a quote, with a unique number, as well as the company's contact information on it.

We're looking to have a solution that lets customers do and print their own quotes in the site, and then contact the company to arrange the order, if they wish to do so. This will free up the salespeople to work on order processing an lead acquisition through other channels, instead of having to receive and reply to customer requests for quotations.

What we envision this platform as is basically a B2B ecommerce platform, without the payment and shipping information part of it. Instead of a checkout button after they've added items to their cart, they'd have a ""Print quotation"" button that'd generate a numbered printout on their end, as well as the company's end, where they both can reference it should the customer decide to call.

Why not go with a full online store instead, you ask? A few reasons:

Payment processing fees are still prohibitively large for this industry and market. Most customers will look elsewhere for a 2% or 3% price difference.

A lot of the logistics can't be done through suppliers that integrate with eCommerce systems, so quotation of transport and scheduling still has to go through people.

A lot of purchasers and customers in the industry aren't used to self-checkout and ""consumer grade"" eCommerce, so this will be an intermediary step that we know they'll feel comfortable with.

Finally, the current website is running on Squarespace, however, it seems it'll be very difficult to build a self-quote system on it, so we're willing to change platforms, or if possible, maintain the current site and add a link to a quotations site, hosted elsewhere, that will allow the customer to self-quote.

I'd love any ideas, feedback or help you might be able to give regarding how to accomplish this.

Cheers!",4,6,2018-11-07,ECOM,0.03585187345743179,0.9370405077934265,0.0271076038479805

dropship,Aliexpress 11.11 Global Shopping Carnival- Dropshipping with 72 hours delivery,"Aliexpress 11.11 shopping festival is coming, are you ready?

Aliexpress 11.11 shopping festival, a worldwide shopping carnival, has already grown into a shopping festival that can compare with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Almost all the products will have great discounts on this day, some even up to 70% off! This year, except the discounts, what drop shippers should pay great attention to is the shipment policy implemented in the shopping festival. 

As we all know, a long-time delivery can be a fatal problem for drop shippers. Because it causes a high return rate and frequency customer complain, which brings great loss to sellers. In order to a quick shipment, many drop shippers choose to drop ship from Amazon, which not only cost more but also the products’ price change frequently and stocks run out easily. Very inconvenient, isn’t it? Now, you got another choice – dropshipping from Aliexpress to eBay、Shopify、WooCommerce etc. with a “global village” shopping experience. 

In order to improve worldwide customers’ shopping experience, Aliexpress implements different ways to shorten the delivery time. Delivery within 72 hours can be realized in half areas of Europe cities. Some core cities of Spain even can finish delivery in a day! More variety of products with lower price and cheaper logistic fees with quicker shipment methods provide a golden chance for worldwide drop shippers. 

So, how drop shippers realize delivery within 72 hours for dropshipping from Aliexpress? The answer to this is simple. That is importing those products according to their ship from location. If you sell to American, then import products which shipped from American warehouse. Also, you can use ShopMaster to save your time and money in this aspect by setting the ship from preference.

For those who want to dropship to non-speaking English countries, one more step needs to be done.  Selecting language preference to import the products. In this case, you can drop ship to different countries.   

ShopMaster is the first official dropshipping partner of AliExpress and aims to help drop shippers start a profitable drop shipping business in a much simpler way. With the help of ShopMaster, you can set shipment from preference, which will allow you to import products only shipped from a certain country one by one or in bulk. What’s more, ShopMaster solves all the problems of dropshipping by providing some other awesome features:

* **Price setting automatically**
* **Auto inventory&amp;price monitor**
* **Auto-order fulfillment**
* **Auto-sync tracking numbers** 

Black Friday and Cyber Monday come after two weeks of Aliexpress 11.11 shopping festival. I believe this will be a warming up activity for your sale boom on the coming busy season of e-commerce. 

This is the golden time for all drop shippers to realize the dropshipping dream in this precious busy season! Let’s go carnival!

ecommerce,Site Recommendations / Review,"Hi r/ecommerce,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I just launched our first ecommerce store this week. We both have a background in marketing &amp; development and in the last year got our first experience with a few client Shopify stores. We really liked it and decided to build our own.

&amp;#x200B;

That said our launch was a bit slow, we did drive some pre-launch sign-ups and offered a coupon code, but got very few sales and traffic has tailed. We understand that with a brand new site we aren't going to have any SEO and the name isn't out there so other traffic will be minimal.

&amp;#x200B;

Our general business plan is to offer one product for a set period of time at a low price (I know it's not original) and hope to sell through it fairly quickly. We did a fair amount of price research and have offered our first product well below Amazon and below the last popular deal on Slickdeals by a few dollars, with free shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for feedback, recommendations and any general comments on the site.

ecommerce,New to the sub - Manage the e-Commerce for Manufacturer,"Hey All,

I am new to the sub and have lurked around here from time to time. I see many posts here about people doing this as a self-start up. I work as the eCommerce manager for an already established wholesale business. 

I run the day to day for their big box retailers. We do not use EDI or API yet and are processing orders manually. Things are getting out of hand (250% growth across the board since I started =D). I hate to boast but no one knew what the hell they were doing before I got here. We plan to commit to EDI or API as soon as Q4 ends. My customers alone we have done 2.5+ million in revenue and I only have one other person that processes the day to day orders under me. 

I manage the assortment and anything to do with it through Excel. I understand there are better ways to manage an assortment...but these options are not available to me nor do I have experience with other software...yet. I do have a BA in Computer Science so I am not scared to learn new software. 

I just wanted to introduce myself. I am from NYC and am always looking for opportunities. I have been in the eCommerce space for about 6 years and have really got into it in the last 3 years. I have been actually managing businesses for the last 2 years. 

What I am curious to understand is the average salary for what I am doing. I want to know my worth and if I should be out there looking for better opportunities with the skill set I have. I am happy where I am and would hate to leave just for money...but being from NYC it would be nice to know a move towards 6 figures is possible. I do not make a bonus based on sales or my salary and do not make commission...yet =). 

 I would be glad to go into more detail...but would feel more comfortable maybe talking through private messages about exactly what I do and numbers. 

Hope to hear some good thoughts from you guys!",25,6,2018-11-08,ECOM,0.02407870814204216,0.9077171087265015,0.06820414960384369

dropship,4 THINGS THAT GUARANTEES HUGE SUCCESS IN ECOMMERCE /SHOPIFY DROPSHIPPING,"We've got it all wrong.

Some of us, rather not to presume, have got it all wrong with shopify and dropshipping.

We have let the excitement of possibilities override the awareness of reality.

It is true that there is wealth in dropshipping, a whole lot of it. But the truth is, those who made it big time with it, took certain things into consideration which made success a little bit easier for them, and that is what I am going to discuss with you in this chapter.

From personal experience, and from what I have witnessed, I will be sharing with you four different important things you need to know if you want your success guaranteed in the journey I am taking you on.

Some of these things are things you know but you don't take any interest in them. But when I show you their relevance, you will have no choice but to agree with me.

Without no further ado, lets begin.



 I.  WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

The first thing I think is utmost by importance for anybody who really wants to make good revenue in dropshipping, Ecommerce Business, is the name of your company!

If I ask you what your name is, can it define what your characters or experiences are? If your name is Solomon, are you a man full of wisdom, lover of knowledge or you are clueless about what being smart is?

Your name is your first attraction point, the first call to action that a customer will engage with and process, before they make a major transaction with you, either you like it or not.

Your name, which is the domain name of your store is very crucial to be directly or artistically related to your store if you want to create a good first impression that last long.

I can wake you up now and ask you what is the name of the best social network out there, and you start mentioning them.... Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram etc. Why? Because their names are 

 1.  Memorable
 2.  Short and Precise
 3.  And directly or artistically related to the brands content
 
So, if you want to start your own Shopify store and you want it to be unique, you need to find a domain that is unique, simple and explanatory enough to register quickly enough in the mind of your potential customers.

Amazon.com. will beat your domain that says digitalexpress.com any day! This is because, we do not know as a potential customer what digital product you are selling and if it (domain name) is in anyway artistic to your product.


AZprinco.com makes no sense, as long as your target audience do not have a clue what you meant by those acronyms.


Learn, be smart, choose a right domain today if you want to multiply your business income.



 II.  WHERE ARE YOUR WAITRESS?

Let me tell you this. If you are running a dropshipping store, and you do not have a side content or product that has the power to retain the attention of your site visitors whenever they come visiting, you will loose them for life. Even if they made a transaction.

There are a lot of ways through which you can do this. Some of the internet guru says you should create a funnel. Hmmn. I wonder what that means!

You want to hear the truth? You can only retain a customer's attention if he is getting a value without the need of a commitment.

See, how many times have you taken an uncle seriously if he tips you cash only after you have done one or two jobs for him?

We all love free gifts, and we are always grateful and loyal to those who give it without ""shouting"" for something in return.

Your ""waitress"" can be a helpful tips, a how to tutorial and so on which can come in form of videos, pictures, podcast, and blogs. Use them to attract attention.

Use them well.



 III.  APPS ARE TRAPS

I think I love how that heading sound, don't you?

That's right!

Apps are traps. Either you like it or not, apps are one way to ruin your entire career in dropshipping business.

Blasphemy!

Whatever you call it, the hard truth is, if you invest on apps to increasing your turnover, you are signing your retirement letter with no 401k fund.

If you doubt me, lets look at it this way.

Say you own a company, and so that you can have more sales, you go spend money on machines that will make your job easier, like the teller machine that automates your sales.

The question is, if you aren't getting any sales, will there be any automation?

If customer are existing before checkout, what is the essence of your costly upsell apps?

Your rent is due, pay up the app company my friend.



 IV.  WHAT ABOUT AD?

Well, I love ads, but that won't make me not to tell you one important rule about ads.

They are not first born my friend, they are last born.

Ads creation should not be your first line of action to get a sale, they are only there to amplify it. 

You think its a lie? Read this post and Facebook advice from one of my blogs IT IS ALL DONE WRONG on www.patreon.com/Samuelawe

If you are looking for the kind of ads that get you sales quickly, it is the conversion ads.

If on the other way round, you are looking for the kind of ads that drains your pocket off cash quicker than you can say God Bless You! The conversion ad is your best bet.

Am I saying that this ad objective is a no no? No. Not at all.

In fact, this ad is the most effective of all the ads in the campaign objectives on Facebook when it comes to that which leads to sales. Nevertheless, for you to train the algorithm that works with this ads to become that effective, Facebook advice that you need between 15 to 25 actions of that specific Conversion Objective you want.

That means, before you can get a very high sales conversion on your store through the Purchase Conversion Ad, you must have had up to 25 sales on your store website.

Eyes opened?

Now, the question I think should pop up into your heart is, how the hell are you going to make sales to help my Conversion Ads?

Don't worry, we will get into that soon.


CONCLUSION

I think now, I have been able to open your eyes into some deep insights on how to improve your store turnover by getting some principles right.

ecommerce,"Dropshipping agreement process, aliexpress alternatives and worldwide brands","What is the process when making an agreement with a dropship supplier? I hear people often talking about doing research to find dropship suppliers, but nothing in detail about what to do once you've found one. How does the entire agreement work? Do you contact them and have to give them business information and then if they agree do they give you access to some private listing of products that includes product images and descriptions which you can add to your store from a website? I know some sites like aliexpress just straight up list their products and prices on a public website where you can pretty much instantly import the products, but I doubt that's the norm, right? Not all dropshippers will be open to everyone I'd imagine.

Also, what are good alternatives to aliexpress or alibaba? Are there any good dropshippers that don't have such long shipping times? I find it hard to find any good information because of how many shady websites are out there with questionably product quality.

ecommerce,"I used to work for a 3P Amazon Seller over a year ago. Now, I want to sell on Amazon. Will Amazon think I'm a sockpuppet account and ban me?","Hi, as the title says, I used to work for an ecommerce company managing all our Amazon accounts, which all sold the same knock off things on different IP addresses so it was against Amazon TOS. It was stressful, I feared everyday I'd walk in to the kiss of death email for each account, and I would be put to blame &amp; fired (because that's the kind of people I worked for). Plus I had a guilty conscience for contributing to abusing the system and being part of the problem the Amazon forums would complain about. So, I took a risk and started my own online stores to sell honestly and did freelancing. It got to be enough that I could quit and I've been on my own ever since.

Now, I'm considering selling on Amazon--first as an individual seller. But when I worked for my old company, I signed into one account to answer emails on the weekend at home. I was trusted enough to sign in through main login and not the employee logins. For the others, I'd just reply through the accounts' email which in hindsight, I should have done for all. Lesson for all those for all ecommerce employers and employees. I work from home so my IP address is the same still and I plan to sell in similar categories since my items are similar. 

So, will I get in trouble? Has it been long enough for it not to matter? Do you think that if Amazon messages me about it, I can explain the situation just by saying that was my old company? Anyone from a similar situation?

TL;DR - worked for a shady 3rd party Amazon seller, signed in at home to answer emails on weekends. I now do my own thing and want to start selling on Amazon, but could be banned because same IP address. Advice?",17,16,2018-11-10,ECOM,0.10796946287155151,0.8696446418762207,0.02238590456545353
dropship,GENERAL STORE GOLDMINE,"GENERAL STORE GOLDMINE!


It is not advisable to go into general store when running the shopify model of dropshipping because your best weapon is making it easy for customers to encounter less stress in buying from your store.

Nevertheless, if you want to go into general store, let it be of ""Complimentary products"".

This is because it will keep customer glued to your store and increase your sales by x3 if you upsell them!


HOW DOES IT WORK?

If you decide to sell woman clothes, gown, and classic wear like tshirts and jeans.

After uploading these products, search for complimentary products that suit and go well with each and every one of the products in pendants, shoes, bags, purse, and glasses.

Download an upselling app from shopify App store, and add those complimentary products as an upsell to the cloth or dress that they fit well with.

And since you showing your customer what goes well with their product plus a very compelling copy, you are most likely to make another sale.


CASE STUDY

I own a store, and I decided to sell classic wears like jeans, tshirt.

Then it is reasonable for me to go for classic complimentary fashion products like Cat Eye Glasses, small pendants necklaces, cross over bags, high heel shoes etc.

Selling a green shirt, I can upsell the buyer with a green cat eye glasses or and a green bag that fits well with what they are interested in.

I can also go on to give a discount in the purchase of the upsell product. And you should know that the discount would have been factored to the product price.


THE IMPORTANCE

This method keeps customer a little longer in your store in search of a complimentary product for their first purchased product, and give them more options and reasons to come back later if they do not budget for an extra purchase. 

This automatically increases your turnover!",3,9,2018-11-10,ECOM,0.0439448319375515,0.9096090197563171,0.046446118503808975

dropship,"Hit a roadblock, advice to get back started?","Back in April I began setting up a niche drop ship store. I had everything setup - strong products, unique branding, marketing plan and even ordered samples myself to see how long shipping takes, inspect quality and to photograph the product so it's more unique and inline with my brand vision.

However, that last part led me to hit a mental road block and I ultimately gave up. Long story short, my niche is clothing and finding models, setting up a quality studio and the idea of having to constantly be aware of fashion trends was overwhelming (I use to run an ecommerce fashion store and knew how much effort/money it takes to make a clothing store stand out).

My friends keep nagging me to get back into it, mostly because they want what I had planned to sell, and I want to but part of me wants to find a more manageable niche that's more self-sustainable, but I haven't found a worthwhile niche yet/one that I actually want to spend my time selling.

shopify,New to developing with Slate. I have some questions.,"Hi all, I'm pretty new to developing with Slate. I've installed the Slate environment on my local machine using the instructions here: https://github.com/Shopify/slate/wiki/Getting-Started

I don't know if I am doing it right, however, and have some questions.

1. Is the Starter Theme meant to look broken and unstyled? I got the issue where HTTPS requests were blocked (as mentioned here https://github.com/Shopify/slate/wiki/4.-Create-a-self-signed-SSL-certificate) so I re-created my Self-Signed SSL Certificate. No change there. I then visited the links in the console, clicking 'Proceed' on Chrome. The errors disappeared but the site still looks bad - no css.

2. I'm not sure Watch or Browser Sync is working. Whenever I try to alter a file in the theme, nothing happens - my browser does not refresh and refreshing it manually produces no changes.

3. How do I compile SCSS? Is this something I will need to do separately with nodejs?

4. Finally, does anyone know of any good tutorials? I found the Slate Github wiki to be pretty light on info.

shopify,"Ok for real, how do I actually test a product??","I’m 21 years old working part time in retail on minimum wage. I’ve been working really hard and asking extra days so I’ve saved up a bit for Shopify. I know I may lose it all and I can afford to do it, but I want to try.

I have my store set up for dropshipping and it’s ready for customers. My question is, how do I actually test a product that I think will do well? When I try research this people just kind of say stuff without much meaning behind it. Or they will suggest a method that has no real system behind it. 

Is there a resource or anyone that could share their opinions and strategies for actually testing your products? It’s extremely hard to find information on this without people telling you to purchase their course. 

I have researched a lot on Facebook ads but I don’t know do I test using PPE, WC or anything else. And when do I know when to scale? I know this thread is a bit all over the place, but that’s how my mind feels at the minute trying to put a strategy in to place! I know I could just try and fail but I’d rather actually go in with some form of a strategy to save some money rather than go in guns blazing.

ecommerce,Merch for a webcomic community : go big or go small ?,"Hello guys, I have a semi-popular webcomic online (40.000 followers on Facebook and a bit on twitter/instagram also). I get around 1K likes/comic, and the community is pretty strong and supportive. I had 2 paper albums edited and around 1200 sells each.

A company came to me with a deal for merchandisings, things like mugs and totebags, maybe tee-shirts. My editor counter-offered, and... I have trouble choosing ! So basically : 

* First company :
   * good quality
   * small professionnal business (so cool, but I  some paperwork to do to create my company in order to bill them)
   * can make mugs, totebags, teeshirts / sweatshirts, but no prints (stickers)
   * better for big commands (best margin and scalable).
   * but has high flat rates( like 7€/shipping +2€/ command for me), so it makes small commands more expensive (eg a 1-mug purchase costs 17€ for customer, shipping included, and I get 2€ margin)
   * &amp;#x200B;
* My editor :
   * normal quality
   * small family business (so not much paperwork to do, but from experience I know it can lack a bit of pressionalism)
   * can make mugs, totebags, maybe some prints, but no teeshirt / sweatshirts
   * better for small commands (better price for customer, can be sold directly on comics festival) eg. for 1 mug it costs the customer around 12€ (shipping included) and I get 1.2€ margin.
   * but it's not the core of their business, not scalable and depends on stocks

What do you think ? I ""go big"" with the first company ? Or ""go small"" with my editor  ?

I think it mainlycomes to : what would my readers typically buy : 1 mug, or 2 mugs + 1 totebag ? I don't really know. I feel they would more likely buy small commands, but... it's just a hinch. And I don't know how to make a market study or find that kind of information (appart from reddit hopefully :p )Of course, the first company tells me people mainly make big purchases (no wonder, making a small purchase on their website is too expensive).

Also, I don't really see people buying teeshirts and sweatshirts of my comic, as it's badly drawn on purpose. Funny to read, but to wear ?

shopify,"I've been too scared lately to bite the bullet and start putting $30/day into ad testing... But I finally did it yesterday, and I made just over $100 in 9 hours! Don't be afraid to take action guys. Sometimes you have to be willing to lose money, and that's what it takes.","https://i.imgur.com/0eL535m.png

I'm an incredibly frugal person, and I think that comes from me not having a stable job. (Moving around a lot, no secure income, I've been very protective over the money I have)

I'm 20 years old, I don't have a job and I don't have my driver's license yet. This is all due to family drama and moving around too frequently to know where to get my license, or to get a job, because I'm afraid I'll have to quit after a couple months.

So my plan has been to make money online through doing 3D freelance work, and selling 3D assets. However, that didn't seem to be a consistently viable option as clients are incredibly tough to deal with on a daily basis, and I burned out fairly quickly, making me question my passion in 3D art.

So that income stream was a dud.

Thankfully, I've been babysitting about once a week for a family friend, at about $40 a night (or $160/month), so at least I had some trickle income.

I saved up as much as I could, upgraded my computer to make freelance and quality of life easier, but as well as just general savings.

At the time I started this store, 2 weeks ago, I had $427 in savings, and I was willing to spend every dollar if I had to. I'm not a quitter... But I'm not a spender either.

Two weeks ago, I spent $12 over the course of 3 days when I made my first 2 sales. I didn't get anything after that, and I felt like something was missing from the site.

I spent the next 2 weeks redesigning and rebranding the site, fixing the sales funnel, and making the site more engaging.

That was all well and good, and relatively easy, but then reality hit me.

I *knew*, that I was going to have to risk a large amount of my savings *per day*, if I wanted to see results. But I was so freaking scared to even take that risk.

When you save up for so long, and that little bit of money is all you have, you become very protective over it.

...but, I just knew I had to.

I ran an ad, had 6 adsets for it at $5/piece, and stayed up to almost 5am (started at 1am) to make sure I had triple checked that all my ad sets were good.

This was yesterday, and it was *sooooo* stressful all day yesterday. I was tired and exhausted, just by the mental weight from the thought of me risking all my savings, but I was willing to let it run for several days before touching them. I had, and did come to terms with that reality.

I was babysitting again last night, finally taking a break to watch random YouTube videos for the first time in weeks. Felt nice to finally take my mind off things-- *Kaching!*

9pm last night, I made my first sale in 2 weeks, or really my second ""first sale"", so really my first sale with this site reboot.

I was so relieved. Instantly all this weight was lifted off my shoulders. I felt like I had energy again!

I then got another sale 2 hours later at 11pm! And then I woke up with another one from 6am! 

This is actually the first day that I woke up before 11am-12pm in months! (Woke up at 9:50am)

---

Don't be afraid to take action guys! But absolutely do your research and always stay learning, but don't let that get in the way of you actually doing stuff. Sometimes, all it takes is a little leap of faith! :)

(edit/update: This day ended with me getting 3 more sales today. Second day of running ads, and it's my first $100 day! ($160 in total of 2 days of ads) Here we go bois!!)

Edit 2: day 4 into it I think. Weekend was super slow, only made 1 sale a day. Not sure exactly what happened, as I didn't change the assets. It's Monday now, apparently weekends are the slowest, so I'll give it one more day, and I'll kill it tomorrow if I don't make any more sales today. Then I'll try another product. Never give up! 💪",59,71,2018-11-16,ECOM,0.045070286840200424,0.9182372689247131,0.03669244796037674

Update

11.18.18

Following up on my brainstorming session, I really want to focus my dropshipping site as a brand, which I hope to leverage for longevity instead of a quick trend. With that being said, I am penetrating in women's fashion, a very saturated market but something that I am passionate about.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the tools that I am using are Asana, Photoshop, Illustrator. Additionally, I have paid $180 for a premium theme, $50 for a few content writers for blog posts and $100 for a professional logo (this designer is a close friend who chargers $500 per logo, but I use her often).

&amp;#x200B;

My positioning statement revolves around my product, a problem that currently persists and a solution that I can provide.

&amp;#x200B;

My market research revealed a few competitors, barriers to entry and best way to penetrate the market. Also, I focused on the pros/cons of dropshipping, which I know what my limitations are/what my personal goals are.

&amp;#x200B;

Presentation is key in the fashion industry and I will have to maintain a unique positioning in order to be successful. I really want to do a free live stream or hold a Q and A. I would like to share my site and niche, but that is counterintuitive of for my business - perhaps I can do a made up one.

ecommerce,Postal Conspiracy Theory,"So over past years, this has happened to us numerous times. A batch of USPS that goes out together, does not get scanned by the carrier… does not get scanned by the local station… and does not get scanned at the main sorting facility. So basically, the packages go out across the country, with nothing more showing on tracking than 'label prepared’. It’s not like we’re in some little town. We are in one of the largest cities in the country. How is it possible this happens numerous times a year? I’ve asked many people within the org. I’ve yet to hear an explanation that makes sense. I could see the carrier or ONE facility having a problem and not scanning. But how does nobody in the entire area not scan, at multiple locations?

&amp;#x200B;

The best part of this… If one of the packages ultimately disappears under that scenario and you make a claim… “Claimed Denied. No proof of package sent”. Maybe if you’re a giant and you have your own rep, you can get satisfaction from this. If not, then you will get nothing. In the past I have submitted tracking info showing the other packages in the same batch, which also shows that nothing in that batch was scanned on our end. How can I prove stuff was picked up, when nobody in your org scans it for whole two days? They don’t care… “Claimed Denied”

&amp;#x200B;

Theory: Imagine you’re USPS and you’re losing your ass repeatedly, year after year. Your minimum automatic insurance on priority and above is especially hurting, because you lose people’s stuff constantly. *Gee… If only there was some way we could get out of paying a big chunk of those claims. Some kind of way where we could just sort of ‘forget’ to scan millions of packages, and then the thousands of packages that happen to get lost among those, we would then have an excuse to not have to pay the claim, thereby saving us hundreds of thousand$ in claims. Hmm… If only.*",4,5,2018-11-16,ECOM,0.06775698065757751,0.9034639000892639,0.028779178857803345
dropship,Why would you NOT buy an established drop shipping account?,"There are THOUSANDS of shops for sale on exchange constantly. Some that are start ups, some that have social media presences, some profitable, some not. BUT how does it not make sense to invest in these?

-Price of listing: 2,500$
-Average profit: 4,375$ monthly 
-Niche: Specific type of clothing

dropship,I launched my first influencer ad yesterday and only made 2 sales :( What to do next?,"Yesterday I launched my first influencer advertisement and in my opinion I liked how it went because I made my first sale which was exciting but it didn't do any insane sales or anything. It launched 17 hours ago on this page: [@woodturners\_worldwide](https://www.instagram.com/woodturners_worldwide/). It cost me $15 USD and until now I have sold 2 watches, one using the discount code which I gave to that influencer to put on his post and the other one used a code from my own post on my Instagram page so I'm not sure if the influencer even directed that second customer. With all the costs spent (Including influencer, domain etc.) I am $16.04 USD in losses. I am not sure what to do now, there is one page I had my eyes on which costs $30 USD: [@wooodworking](https://www.instagram.com/wooodworking/?hl=en) which I want to advertise with this black Friday but I'm not sure whether I should do that and risk that money or use Facebook retargeting ads which I'm not sure will even have enough people to retarget to as my pixel states that there has been 1400 views on my store, 280 view content actions and only 14 initiating checkout. I am not sure what the next step should be, I have spent  $30.93 USD in total and made $14.89 USD and I don't want to risk anything more than $57.32 USD these coming days because I don't want my losses to exceed $100 AUD.

dropship,What Type Of Ads To use For Influencers,"I am about to launch my first influencer ad. Originally I created an ad with the item image, item name, little item description, text which adds scarcity like 'limited time' 'limited stocks available' and a heart eyes emoji next to the product. All this wouldn't seem like a good mix at first but I made it look very simplistic and appealing. Now I sent this to the inlfuencer and he said this word for word ""The post looks a lot like an ad which has typically not done well on my page"" so asked if he just wanted to use a plain image of my product because his audience would feel like he's just recommending a product to them instead of feeling like they are being advertised to because as it is a woodworking niche page and the product is a wooden watch the idea of the ad revolves around ""Unlucky we can't build any watches on our pages yet, but I've seen this already amazing watch which you should...."" so maybe it's more audience friendly without the flashy text?.

Me and two friends finally went live with our first ever e-commerce site a while ago ([https://skriftshirts.com/](https://skriftshirts.com/)). I have heard that the t-shirt niche is very competitive, but we are just learning things right now and wanted to go for something quite easy to set up. 

For now the strategy is to grow an Instagram account for a bit and run ads off that to funnel customers to the site. We actually posted one of the designs to 9gag (of all places) and got some nice feedback which was good to hear. 

We would really love all the positive and negative feedback you can give on both the site, concept and the strategy going forward! Anything really that can help us take the next steps would be greatly appreciated.

Are there any known Chinese brands or stores that specifically sale unbranded clothes?

dropship,Becoming a dropshipper (Supplier) of posters.,"I'm selling Posters/Prints on Etsy since 3 years with big success, (+8000 sales), but I don't trust Etsy or any of those marketplaces, because they have the power to close your account for any reasons any days. I heard scary stories....

My idea is to become a drop shipper (supplier) for anyone (serious people) who want to sell my products, the way they want, where they want and at the price they want.

I sell posters, I'm a designer but I found out that the most successful products are not my own designs but vintages prints which I digitally restored to give them good resolutions when printed. My most successful products are Vintage travel Posters from 30's, Japanese art from the 19 century, old advertisings, paint reproductions, old maps, soviet propaganda,  etc.. Only old stuff to avoid copyright problems.

The added value of my products is that I digitally restored those old illustration/images to give them a high-resolution look when printed, so I have many unique products because other posters stores didn't work that hard on restoring old prints.

I'm not here to sell my products yet and sorry if it's forbidden on that reddit (is it ?). I'm just here to ask your advices, to ask if you think that many dropshipper  are looking for this kind of products?

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is easy :

\- I'll create a websore only for drop shipping (Should I make it private or public with or  without any registration fees?) 

\- Posters will be printed and shipped from USA with a tracking number. (I'm myself based in France but I work with a printing company in USA).

\- On my webstore, you will be able to download a low/medium resolution image of the posters so you can create your own mock-up and publish it on you webstore/facebook, amazon, ebay, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

So yes there are 3 parties involved: me the web designer who create/design the posters, the printing company who print and ship the posters and you who sell the product. But costs are low so there is a place for everyone to make a profit. I hope to make 12x16 inches posters available at 12$, including shipping, you can sell it 19 $ or more...For bigger sizes, I don't know yet the prices.

This the best way because each of the parties works in their field: I'm good at creating posters, the printing company provide good services and you are, I hope, good at selling the products.  I see it more like a collaboration, I'm not a distant Aliexpress seller, me and my assistant are dedicated to this business since 3 years. 

You will just have to fill the order on my webstore and I will take care of the rest, an USPS tracking number will be provided. I don't know yet if it will be profitable to ship outside US, but I'm working to find a solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't see it as an advertising, it's still a project, I'm here to get opinions and feel if there is a demand for such products in the dropshipping ""world"".

We're a bunch of guys with some technical backgrounds who just got into dropshipping business.
It seems a whole new world with a lot of exciting opportunities to us.

We started as selling phone cases but the sales wasn't going that well.
So we used some technical knowledge to obtain some data from Aliexpress and Wish. Basically,
we have all the product information, their daily sales data, all the feedbacks/comments, and more.
Using this information, we're able to boost our sales by selecting the right products
and the right potential customers.

So we figured this might be useful to other dropshippers, so we made a website: https://trenduct.com
We would really like to hear your honest opinion about it, do you see it useful to your business at all?

We're also super interested how your business work in general, to better understand the needs.

- What's your biggest pain during daily your dropshipping?
- Have you wished to have using all these Aliexpress/Wish data?

AMA about this website, and we would also like to hear about your input
about how to leverage this data to help us both. Or maybe there's some other data
that could be useful, and we can figure out a way to obtain and make good use of them.

Let us know.

dropship,Dropshipping Slack Channel - Mentorship/Collaborative Community (Repost),"Over the course of the past 2 years, I've been on the dropshipping journey doing whatever I could to make a ""liveable"" income. Having got to that point where my first partnership did $100k in gross (year 1) and a new corporate venture that's brought in $350k+ in the following year, I wanted to dedicate my free time to helping out others who are struggling, need advice, or simply guidance on where to go next.

I've always come back to this thread to throw in my 2 cents, heed caution to the masses on where not to get screwed, and so much more. I've also viewed and dealt with my fair share of those who think they are know-it-alls and while behind a computer screen decide to be condescending to those who simply need a helping hand.

While this thread might be beneficial for some, I see it lacking in many areas where experts or seasoned dropshippers could play a big role in making a difference. Many turn to Guru's on Youtube or courses that cost absurd amounts of money, but this info is already out there for free, you just either need to find it, or find people willing to share it with you.

So, I decided to create a Slack Channel for dropshipping. I originally planned to make YouTube videos but wanted to do something different. I wanted to provide an instant answer/connection to someone with advice alongside other individuals who either have the same question or offer up their own opinion/solution.

dropship,"Messed up adset scaling, how to repair it","Started an ad at $5/day. After a while, i duplicated it, targeting a new interest. Sales were coming in from both but more from the duplicated adset, so I duplicated that again, scaling the budget of the new duplicated adset 15% each day. This was working extremely well. I was making a decent amount of sales from each adset. After 7 days, my increasing budget adset was at $13.27, and generating a good amount of sales. This is were the problem comes in. I decided duplicated that adset and increased the budget of the new adset from $13.27 to $25. After this my sales plummeted. I only made two sales, one from the new adset.

shopify,Let's talk about your Shopify themes,"I had the chance to experience some Shopify themes and here are my comments:

(it based on my experience using those themes at this time, no at present)

\- Yourstore theme: It used to be the best Shopify theme seller on ThemeForest (TF) many weeks. But then, suddenly it's removed. I like the visual section and clear config. The documentation is detailed. But I don't like the support. Sometimes if you have negative feedback, they just answer by a template and ask if you want to refund.

\- Fastor theme: The config section is not that special/outstanding comparing to other themes I had used. Is adverted to have the huge number of layouts but most of them look similar. But the support is responsive, quick.

\- Puro theme: I like this theme design the most. Found out it on the list of 20 most beautiful Shopify theme, The design, the settings, the support are all good. The only disadvantage is the design is only ideal for the fashion/jewellery/art store.

\- SalesHunter theme: the recent theme I used. I pumped up their exclusive offer to get $180 theme for FREE when I'm about to open the new store. The experience is really good, what I like the most is they have the sale features that in the past I need to install apps to have.

What about your favorite Shopify themes?",17,10,2018-11-20,ECOM,0.047931112349033356,0.9229547381401062,0.029114151373505592
ecommerce,Opinions on e-commerce setup for a new business,"Hello /r/ecommerce,

I'm just looking for some opinions/conversation here. I'm a web developer. I've built lots of ecommerce sites using Woocommerce, Magento, VirtueMart, ZenCart, OSCommerce, Shopify, Squarespace, Volusion and maybe some others I don't remember. Some of these sites are very successful, some vanished after 3 months. A lot of that has to do with the dedication of the owner I think.

I now have a client that is launching a store selling an herbal supplement. Right now they have only a few products and no sales. They've asked me to look at a CRM system similar to InfusionSoft and give my thoughts. The platform integrates the shop with CC processing and analytics, transactional and marketing email, cart abandonment tools, etc. I've reviewed the vendor's literature and done some searching on them. They're legit and a fairly big player in the space, but they charge $199/mo. + typical CC fees.

My feeling is this... set up an inexpensive e-commerce site and see if you can move some product first. Once you have your business rolling, then look at platforms like this to go to the next level. However, I've never had to deal with anything like this before. So what do you think? Should my client keep costs small (tiny by comparison) at first or should they go all in on the CRM right from the start? The answer seems obvious to me, but I'm more of a developer than a marketer and I'm curious to see what the conventional wisdom on this subject is. Thanks!

I'm looking for more marketplaces to sell our products (Sneakers/Sport Shoes/Trainers/Runners - they're called something different everwhere!).

* Ebay US, CA, UK, FR, DE, IT, ES
* Priceminister (part of rakuten) in France
* Cdiscount in France
* [Real.de](https://Real.de) in Germany
* Onbuy in UK
* Our own website [www.kicksworldwide.com](https://www.kicksworldwide.com)

We used to trade on TradeMe in NZ, FNAC in France and Flubit in UK, but decided to stop due to a lack of orders. 

We have just applied for Rakuten and Market in the UK. 

We have considered Fruugo (data requirements are stopping us here), Allegro in Poland (Difficulties with processing Polish Zloty). We also looked into Niche Sneaker sites such as Goat and StockX (not capable of handling large volume sellers)

Are there any others I should be considering?

ecommerce,Recommendations for setting up a Web Design / Website setup services ecommerce portal,"Good afternoon. I work with a small real estate company as an assistant helping out with technology related stuff. We've been setting up small custom websites for our agents for a while (we charge them a small fee), nothing fancy, just some simple wordpress websites. 

Anyway, we are now getting a ton of orders from agents and we'd like to set up an online portal which we can use to sell our services relating to these websites. So for example, I want to have a service that I'd call ""Simple Website Setup"" that'd be something like $100 and then further addons to the service such as graphic design work, or IDX feed setup for more money. I would also love to integrate the orders that we get through the website into our Basecamp account which we use to track all these projects (something like automatically creating a Basecamp project when a new order is received)

I've been looking into setting up a WooCommerce based web store but I'm not sure if this is something that I should be looking at and if it is, what sort of setup would it require for me to make it work. I'd consider other options if they were available as well. 

Any help or recommendations for setting up something like this are appreciated. Has anyone here done something similar to this before?",8,5,2018-11-20,ECOM,0.024252230301499367,0.9341195821762085,0.0416281558573246

shopify,"[New App] Hey, I've made an app to monitor your competitor's prices and get notified of price changes","Hi everyone, 

Last month I've made a post about the new app I released for Shopify stores / e-commerce owners to monitor their competitor's product prices and receive alerts/analytics about price changes... and I was looking for feedback during the (free) beta stage. 

Some people here told me that the idea was cool and that there was a real market need for that kind of solution. 

Many people signed up but found the process of adding competitors a bit difficult. 

That's why I released a second version with two new features to make this task easier. You can now add competitors directly by entering their website, and a bot will crawl the entire competitor website and match the products you have in common! 

You can also install a Chrome extension, and once you are on a competitor product, click on the extension to directly add it in your PricingBot account. I hope that these improvements will help people to set up their account.

I'd really appreciate some feedback about this, if people still find the setup difficult or not.

ecommerce,Last edited about 1 hour ago Why e-commerce need a native mobile app?,"HI, reddit,
research seems to suggest that
-majority of users would prefer to use an app over a mobile site
- app users spend more time in an app than on mobile sites 
-probability of return visits is higher with apps
-higher spend using apps
-lower cart abandonment
-faster
-better UX
-branding / loyalty
-PUSH NOTIFICATIONS - capitalized because everyone seems to rave about this particular benefit of apps

But it does not match my personal experience. I would never download an app for a store that I don't use frequently. I have walmart, Amazon, Home Depot, and ASOS. Why would someone want your app as opposed to just visiting your site?


I have created a poll in google - https://goo.gl/forms/KvDWGLIpuKHWQOVu2

 - Do you use native apps or website for shopping from mobile?
 - As a SELLER do you want to have a native app for your online store?

dropship,What is Oberlo and is it worth it?,"Greetings! 

Just the other day I saw an add for a product called Oberlo. The video was pretty flashy and they had some interaction with people in the comments.I did notice that the answers seemed kinda robotic and their youtube channel had a lot of professional looking content on it.  I've tried to do some research on Oberlo and found that most of the articles seemed a little biased and didnt seem to focus on any cons. They seemed to be paid for but again thats just the vibe i got from them.  There's not much info on the running cost of using oberlo either as they are partners or are Shopify (?) correct me if I am wrong. 

Now i dont know much about dropshipping but wouldnt mind getting into the business as kinda side gig to my day time job. Is this something I could do? I am not looking to make millions.  I think thats why Oberlo looked appealing to me. 

Anyway I want to know of peoples experiences with Oberlo such as overall costs per month, any good and bad experiences they have had or if theres like contracts involved with Oberlo or Shopify? If i sign up can I cancel anytime with no hassel?

dropship,[Story] Merry Christmas to the lady I accidentally dropshipped a product to for free,"I have taken this past few months experimenting with dropshipping to amazon from aliexpress. A few days ago I was doing my same old thing. I listed an item that I could dropship from aliexpress and I waited (keep in mind I am the noobiest of the noobs here, so I am aware there are a million better ways to doing this). I'm starting to get the hang of the Amazon seller hub and I guess I used the perfect key words, because not 24 hours after I started getting orders , which is something that has never happened to me. I got really excited, I immediately filled out the order information, I messaged the buyer and told them that we will process the order and ship it promptly. By default, amazon gives sellers 48 hours to fulfill the orders, which is something I assumed my aliexpress seller would be able to accomplish. I include a note to ship it promptly and thank them. Then, I play the waiting game.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp, 48 hours later I check aliexpress for the 200th time and these guys STILL haven't fulfilled the order. I only had a few more hours before Amazon did who-knows-what to my account for being late to shipment. I decide the only thing left to do is sincerely apologize to the buyer and refund them their money, then cancel the order from aliexpress.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I check to see if my order was successfully canceled, and everything looked good on Amazon. I checked aliexpress and behold, my seller had shipped it out. Ohh shit. I'm not getting paid. AND their order is getting shipped to them for free. Luckily I paused my listing so I only had to deal with that one fuck-up.

&amp;#x200B;

To whoever gets that package... Merry Christmas! lol

&amp;#x200B;

What I learned:

Give yourself enough time! -&gt; Later on I looked around on how to extend shipping time. I find a section in the listing that you can lengthen the days of the order for processing time. So now I have it set for 5 days which should take care of any time issues on the Amazon end.

Question:

I also realized something. I never got to check and see if the ePacket tracking number from Aliexpress works on Amazon. Anyone with experience in this, does that work?",2,11,2018-11-24,ECOM,0.06396948546171188,0.9065135717391968,0.029516927897930145

dropship,Abandoned carts through the roof,"I'm trying not to post my URL for as long as possible (I don't wanna be a spammy plug-poster). I'm getting thousands of abandoned carts every week. Of course I am retargeting the heck out of them, but the numbers are still frustratingly below average. I have used HotJar to see where I am losing people and refine my UX, with some results.

My items cost enough to make users actually need to consider their purchase, and take up a fair bit of physical space so there's another consideration for customers, but I can't see that justifies these numbers:

* 1 purchase per 12 ""initiate checkout"" actions.
* 1 initiate checkouts per 40 ""add to cart"" actions.
* 1 add to cart per 3 ""product views"".

So on average, it's taking 1440 product views per purchase, with 480 abandoned carts and 12 checkout initiations. That's a lot... right??

Still need to content fill a lot of stuff and still have alot of the base fundamentals im trying to get in place before I can start PPC campaigns. But after, a few theme changes... I feel like im finally starting to feel confident with the stores. I have processed 4 sales so far, strictly through instagram but havn't had anything in the past couple days.

I came in blind to the industry, and trying to research as much as I can to start advertising niche collections. I have over 22,000 product items on the store!!

I work with eHub Solutions (obviously) we are a fulfillment company. basically, all you need to do is send us your products. we will inspect and count it, we will shelve it for you in our warehouse and after you create the shipping plan you want with **Shopify, AliExpress or Amazon** or whatever platform that you may decide to sell on, we will ship your products.

and don't worry, our prices are very cheap, you can check yourself  
[https://ehubsolutions.com/pricing](https://ehubsolutions.com/pricing)  
Our pick and pack is a $1.75  
Our warehouse prices are very cheap as well

**Our monthly storage fees starting as low as $0.45 per cubic foot**, (no long-term storage fee and no inventory removal requirements due to time on the shelf) eHubSolutions provides competitive storage fees for our clients. Compare that to Amazon’s storage fees that range from $0.69 Jan-Sept and a whopping $2.40 Oct-Dec per cubic foot. It’s easy to see how **eHubSolutions** saves you both time and money.

if you divide 0.45 by 2.40 you’ll get **18.75%** so basically ehub solutions would be **saving you more than 80%** of your costs!!",13,13,2018-11-27,ECOM,0.04839324206113815,0.9189026355743408,0.03270412236452103
ecommerce,Shipping/importing concerns (china-usa),"I have been looking into sourcing industrial equipment from China with each unit coming in 3 packages of 25kg/25k/5kg which will be consolidated before shipping.

Because shipping can quickly add up via express air with an average quoted price of around $5.5/kg. I have been looking into sea freight via consolidation in Shenzhen then shipping LCL to my local port in Seattle WA. As i understand it, 100kg/150kg is the smallest quantity to begin using LCL/sea freight. However, after reading many posts and articles I have seen that many times this is still more expensive than shipping express air due to port fees, etc.

I can understand this being true, however have been quoted a $2.15/kg ALL included price from their warehouse in China to mine in Seattle. I was very explicit, yet they hold that the only added fees/customs/etc. would be the initial cost to ship within china from my factory to their warehouse. 

Is a price such as 2.15/kg real? or will i be hit with unexpected charges/fees from my local port? I don't want to go into this blind, any info or recommendations would be fantastic!",7,6,2018-11-27,ECOM,0.057241808623075485,0.9151056408882141,0.027652520686388016

shopify,The Easy Way to Rank Your Shopify Products Higher in Search Engines,"Quick Background:

I've been doing digital marketing around 9 years now. My top SEO wins include helping a non-profit go from 5k to 75k organic visitors per month by creating SEO content. I also wrote two in-depth guides with Neil Patel that helped him rank top 3 for two highly competitive SEO terms: copywriting and conversion rate optimization. Last but not least, I've recently helped a Shopify store go from page 10 to page 1 in Google even though I don't do much SEO anymore and instead help eCommerce stores grow with Facebook ads.

So what's the secret? It comes down to a few things:

1. Knowing basic SEO (more on that below).
2. Optimizing your current pages and then creating content to create even more pages that can rank in search engines.

It's slightly more complicated than that, but not much if you're looking to get started.

So what do you need to know to rank your Shopify store/products higher in search engines?

1. **Keyword Research:** The first thing you need to know how to do is to do basic keyword research with a tool like Google Keyword Planner or KWFinder (my personal favorite). The goal here is to make sure you're optimizing for the right terms. If you don't know, you might use a phrase like ""free literature,"" on your site (just an example), when 5 people search for that and 5000 people search for ""free books."" In a case like this, you don't want to accidentally use ""free literature"" on your site which will kill your chances for ranking for a more valuable term like ""free books.""
2. **Selecting Long-Tail Terms:** My next recommendation is to  choose long-tail terms that you have a chance to rank for. Long-tail means more detailed and lower search volume. The reason you want to go for long-tail terms is because you actually have a chance to rank since EVERYONE is fighting to rank for short tail terms. 9 times out of 10, I'd target long-tail terms. It's possible to rank for short-tail terms, like I did with Neil Patel, but that's more work and a totally different strategy. Example: Let's say you're trying to rank for ""messenger bag."" That's going to be more difficult to rank for than something like ""vintage leather messenger bag"" or ""men's vintage leather messenger bag"" or ""best leather messenger bag."" Those aren't necessarily going to be easy, but you're more likely to rank for those terms than ""messenger bag"" straight up. The lesson here is to make sure you pick realistic, long-tail terms to optimize for since it's better to rank #1 for a term with 250 searches than #20 for a term with 25000 searches per month. Tip: I like to use Google suggested searches and recommended searches to find these long tail terms. Another tool you can use is UberSuggest.org.
3. **Optimizing Your Site:** The next step is to optimize your site. In order to do that, you want to use the keywords in as many of these places as possible: the title for your page, the meta description for your page, your page content (product headline, description, etc. - as many times as possible without overstuffing and making it read awkwardly), the alt tags for images, and the URL for your page (not quite as important but good if you can).  Those are the main boxes to check as far as where you need to have your keywords show up. I also don't have time to explain exactly how to do this on Shopify, but if you Google SEO for Shopify, you should be able to figure it out.
4. **Bonus:** One final important thing to do is to focus each page on one keyword. It's possible to rank for more, but you're better off targeting one term per page and creating more pages than trying to stuff one page with lots of terms.

That's pretty much it.

Does it work? The answer is yes. I helped a Shopify store go from out of the top 100 to the top 10 for multiple terms by following this strategy. We didn't do any link building or do anything else, just focused on the above points. The main thing to remember is that 90% of stores aren't even doing these basic things, so if you do, you automatically get bumped up. At the very least, you need to start with these basics, and then do more advanced SEO once you have.

More advanced techniques include:

1. **Link Building:** I'm not as good as this and have ranked multiple sites on page one and top three without worrying about it.
2. **SEO Content:** You can also create content for SEO and this is where you can 15X your SEO traffic when you go from having 10 pages on your site to 100+. However, it takes more work, so I would make sure you cover points 1-4 above FIRST and then worry about content.

Too many people have wasted $400 on ads on a store that hardly made sales that much.

Is it that Shopify is dying? Really? Who even cooked that up?

Shopify is a non living thing for chrissakes. It is an idea, that which has a huge potential.

And as the saying goes, ideas don't suck, strategy does.

Awful, and my dear lord I mean awful and outdated strategy have been passed around and consumed by too many new and existing shopify owners on the internet that it seems there is no more future.

But one thing we have failed to realise is that Shopify is a platform on which you as an entrepreneur needs to build on.

What exactly now is the problem?

Money? No. 

Winning Ad strategy? Not at all. 

Winning products? I for one hate to hear those words. And No!

So, what is the problem?

Well, if you are looking for the problem, do not waste much cash on UBER, cos  the problem is with you, and you are!

I don't mean to be disrespectful here, just bare with me for a little while.

So, I want to ask you a question. If you have the choice to buy a running sneakers online, who will you patronize? Amazon or your dropshipping store?

Good.

Thank God you know that.

If you within yourself can't buy from your store when you have Amazon as your alternative, then why should your customer do?

If you are using Shopify platform for Dropshipping, then don't try to compete, the atmosphere is too crowded. If you want to win, be ready to be DIFFERENT. You need to become the voice amidst the noise.

The truth is, you and 100 other people can be selling a running sneakers, you might even be the one with little running capital to run ads and create awareness for your store, bur if you follow this thread, I will enlighten you the more on ways to steal the market.


Nevertheless, if you want to follow the old and hardly working ideas, looking for that winning product or profitable niche, you are welcome, I for one will be ready to take your money for consultation on such. As long as you are ready to be patient and spend a huge sum of money on ads.

I want to announce to you that Shopify is not dead, and you don't need $800- $5500 to succeed on it.

The idea is to work smart, not to work hard with your hard earned money.

Google Trends will tell you the search volume, the states with high search volumes, similar searched terms, and on different time frames.

This afternoon I did a little research for my niche. I found that specific states, specifically in the Northwest, were more likely to search for certain products in the last 7 days.  

Using this information, I narrowed my ads down to a limited number of states....and wouldn't you believe it, I had a $29.99 sale in that same state with $0.57 in ad spend.

shopify,"Shopify Payments Cancelled, what to do?","Hey guys first post here, I wanted to ask for some advice. I recently received an email saying that my shopify payments gateway  was cancelled due to my site being high risk. In total I have had 51 orders and have had 4 high risk orders (same customer from Indonesia). Mistakingly, I went ahead with the orders. Since then I have been charged back for those orders. I guess it was a rookie mistake. I want to restart dropshipping but other payment gateways charge too much, to actually make a profit. I want to keep the name ([ninjagadgets.com](https://ninjagadgets.com)). I guess my question is can I close the store and reopen it again after some time with the same name? Or do you recommend to use something else other than shopify? Or stick with shopify and open a brand new store? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help/comments are appreciated!",24,7,2018-11-30,ECOM,0.09552828967571259,0.8778742551803589,0.026597516611218452
shopify,"Developer here: does anyone know of a ""recommended products"" app that is highly customizable? I need to meet a very specific design.","I'm a developer working on a client store and usually the standard ""customers also purchased"" method where you just show products that are related by collection or tags isn't enough for this client. They want something fancier, like many of the ""recommended products"" apps offer. 

But I need to meet a very specific design and was wondering if any of you know of one that would help me out there. 

Thanks!",5,7,2018-11-30,ECOM,0.023105662316083908,0.9268057942390442,0.050088588148355484
ecommerce,Any high risk industry experts here?,"hi folks,

we have a ecommerce business (auctions platform -  B2C and B2B) and  were using paypal payflow to have our payments  processed. We were using them for about two years now and then decided  to make few upgrades to the platform last month with an development  company out of eastern Europe. 

As of this morning paypal no  longer provides their services and has sent an email stating that they  have re-evaluated our business model and  we are at high risk. Our  return rate is at 12% and thats way below industry standards, not once have we skipped payments.

Any way, we are looking for new merchants and there are quite a few out there. 

But any one in a high risk industry here? that recommends a merchants with less problems?

Our business is based and operated in US and clients are US as well.",1,7,2018-11-30,ECOM,0.023631194606423378,0.9104800820350647,0.06588876992464066
dropship,Drop Shipping Products!,"Hello guys!

I am new to drop shipping and I am just starting my own Shopify store. I have done a ton of research on everything but now it's time to pick what niche I want to sell to on my store. I have already put in a lot of time researching all of this but I am prepared to put in a lot more time respectively with picking a niche that's unsaturated, building my website around it, finding trust able suppliers on ali express, and finding the products that would sell and bring profit.

My question is, what are some niches that are saturated to stay away from. I really don't know which niche I want to get into but I do know that It won't be one of the saturated ones on the big YouTube videos or whatever. I am mostly asking this so I can look at these niches that are saturated and have done well as a reference to pick my niche and develop my store after others who are succeeding.   
Any help would be greatly appreciated!",11,6,2018-11-30,ECOM,0.017637327313423157,0.8836330771446228,0.09872955828905106

dropship,"Best tool to use (oberlo, shopmaster, salehoo, etc)","Hi all. I’m very new to this. I don’t even have a website shop set up yet. All I know is to use Shopify and get some products and sell them. 

I want to get into dropshipping but I’m hearing about all these tools that seem great. Sometimes aliexpress can really screw over your orders. 

My question is which is the best? Or is it best I just do it myself with aliexpress through trial and error and not require any of those “tools”. Thank you all in advance",24,4,2018-11-30,ECOM,0.03822368383407593,0.9217851161956787,0.03999115526676178
