ecommerce,"Email marketing for e-commerce (how to execute a $19,000 launch in 12 hours)","Earlier this year, I ran a product launch that brought in 19k in just under 12hrs, using no paid advertising. 

We launched to the businesses email list, which was less than 3000 people at the time.  This was for apparel products, bundled in prices from $130-300.

I'll share a quick synopsis of how we did it, but first, I am curious:

**What is your single biggest challenge when it comes to email marketing for your ecommerce business?**

I see a lot of businesses focusing more on SEO and paid advertising, but there is HUGE potential in the email list.  Happy to talk about it if anyone has an ecommerce business, but isn't getting big results with their email list.  It definitely takes a specific approach.

Here is the quick synopsis of how I ran the 19k launch. 

For reference, the final email we sent had a 60% open rate and 50% click-through rate, which is extremely high in any market. This was based on a killer subject line, and the anticipation we had already built about the launch.

1. Ran a deep dive survey to discover the pain points in the market
2. Built a story around the products that the market would identify with, because it was built on their pain points.
3. Built anticipation for the product launch with a series of 5 emails. The last email was an ""inspiration"" email with a powerful story that directly related to the market's #1 pain point (this is the one with the really high open and click through rate).
4. Opened up the cart on launch day for a period of just under 12 hours.

It was a pretty wild day to say the least - the business owner was literally jumping up and down, because 19k is more than he made his first year out of college...and it all happened in less than 12 hours.

Would love to hear what your single biggest challenge is when it comes to email marketing for e-commerce.

And like I said, happy to chat more about how to do this in your business (I am a copywriter and marketing consultant).",32,16,2016-08-01,ECOM,0.03553689271211624,0.9318848252296448,0.03257835656404495

shopify,Considering Switching From BigCommerce,"I have a new project that after a lot of research I went with BigCommerce over Shopify because of the larger feature set out of the box like wish lists, product recommendations, more analytics,live chat, and integration with Google shopping all without any extra cost like I would have to pay with Shopify. Integration with Square that I use for POS, inventory management, and payment processing was a big selling point as well.

Come to find out they are moving to a new framework and the new Stencil themes do not work with a great deal number of apps! At the same time I find I would be wasting money by investing in a custom theme on their old framework called Blueprint. Also, it sounds like on their forum that the Square POS system doesnt work with one person saying it often takes days for his inventory to sync, I need it in real-time. I'm literally in shock that such an important feature doesnt seem to work and that I cant add a loyalty program to my site.

So I am looking to possibly move to Shopify but I have some concerns:

1) Is Shopify Payments safe to use? I found an old thread where a guys account had been closed down for a few days. But it sounds like it was just because he reached the federal reporting threshold. is this a safe option to rely on? I have been doing business with Square for years so I feel safe with them. They have a good reputation with Stripe right? It's not like PayPal where you always have to worry is it?

2) Does Shopify POS sync inventory levels in real time? I do trade shows 6 months out of the year but not the other 6. Will I still need to pay the $40 a month for the 6 months I am not using it? Square is free and I already have the hardware.

3) Ballpark, how much am I really looking at to be able to add features like up-sell, ratings, recommendations, and wish lists to Shopify? I presume that on Shopify the apps actually work with the themes correct? Does BigCommerce really have Shopify beat with Analytics and how well does Shopify work with Google Shopping?

4) Shopify seems to be much more popular than BigCommerce, what are some other reasons I should be looking at Shopify again now that Ive ran into these issues?",4,3,2016-08-01,ECOM,0.033716071397066116,0.9346022009849548,0.031681742519140244
ecommerce,"So, what do you do exactly, when you work in eCommerce?","Hi guys, I've been thinking about changing my job for something eCommerce-ish. I like the prospect of driving and measuring direct sales. But I don't know much more about it. I mean, I've worked in media planning and buying for several years now, including a digital-only position, but as it goes with big media agencies, you end up planning more than less brand awareness campaigns, and the performance you optimize for is usually just visible ad impressions, or traffic to the landing page, and there it ends. Any real performance optimization (whatever the conversions may be) happens elsewhere (other not so revenue driving channels, onsite, etc). So, can I ask you to state your job title and say a few sentences about what you do exactly and whether you like it and why? And what would the requirements be to get such a job? Also, please, talk dirty ecommerce-ish, I'll be able to understand most of the vocabulary, and if not, I will google it. Brand or agency/consultant side, anything is welcome.

I'm new to shopify and although I love the new look of my site, there are a couple of tweaks I want to make:

- Change the dimensions of the product images
I feel they are too big and when I have a product that is tall (e.g clothing) next to a product that is not (e.g handbag) there is a lot of white space on the smaller product image

- I need a colour change on the links within the drop down menu 
When the mouse hovers over the link, I want a background colour or font colour change to indicate to the customer where they will be clicking

- I need an icon to indicate other colour options available
Just a simple box below/over the base of the image saying 'More Colours Available'

It has grown steadily and currently has an annual revenue of 60K. It is profitable but really doesn't make much money obviously. :-) I grew the company from nothing but a few thousand and a few SKU to over 1k SKU. Currently I think I'm around 650-700 SKU.

I'm really not sure what the best options are for the next step. I have contacted a couple of brokers and they weren't interested because of the limited revenue and the minimums that they deal with.

ecommerce,Which merchant service do you prefer for Wordpress ecommerce sites?,"We're really leaning towards WooCommerce, however, it looks like the cost can really add up when you factor in the price of extensions.

A little background: we're building a wholesale site as well as a retail site (they are two separate websites on two separate servers). For the wholesale site we need to hide prices from users who have not registered and been accepted as a wholesaler. It would be ideal if they could still view the catalog (as opposed to making the site accessible through logging in).

For our retail site, we will need a way to allow users to book reservations for events at our shop as well as make a down payment or full payment for those reservations.

I see that WooCommerce offers extensions that enable us to do these things. I have also found free WordPress plugins which have similar functionality.

I started an e-commerce site in the vaping space about 3 months ago.

After buying her a mod, she hasn't touched cigarettes since, and I was sold that vaping was powerful. The market also is very nascent and there seems to be a ton of room to disrupt it.

PPC ads for vaping are against the TOS on all major ad networks which creates an interesting challenge for marketing. I've been attempting to use content marketing to solve this and have been spending a ton of time creating high quality e-juice review videos. They are head and shoulders above the other review videos in the industry in my opinion, but have yet to catch any kind of traction.

I'm looking to sell products already manufactured. The biggest problem is the minimum quantity orders.

I think the idea is perfect but they select who they want and what I sell was not right for their site.

Basic idea; Sell an item at $x and if 10 people are interested the price drops to $x/2 if 100 people are interested drop to $x/4 and etc.
Another idea; Set a limit for each item, once reached they are purchasable. The above is slightly better because it encourages people to spread the word. This later example will cause people to sit back and wait. 
Either of the above should allow for a range of options, so buyers can pick what they need but ultimately have minim limit so that the items can be produced. Any ideas?",0,2,2016-08-05,ECOM,0.06830085068941116,0.9003192186355591,0.03137991204857826

woocommerce,Amazon Affiliate + Local Cart,"Hi All,
I've been running a simple Wordpress page for my very small business for several years, but I never plugged in with a true shopping cart.  I know it is bad practice, but I would just ask users to contact me via phone or e-mail to place an order.   Understandably, that was causing me to lose order, and I get why.   And that is why I am starting to build up my Woocommerce catalog of the items I have been stocking and selling.

My problem is that I think I'm shifting gears here and instead of keeping a very small inventory of items to sell, and calling the distributor each time a sale is made to place an order, I think I am going to just go with Amazon Associates.   The pricing at Amazon is already better than I could sell the items for and if you can't beat them, join them I guess!    Plus, as a small business, now I am not keeping inventory, dealing with returns, etc.

But there is one small line of items where I need to keep sales ""in house"".  I can't sell these via an Amazon Affiliate account.

From what I am seeing directly from Woocommerce, that shouldn't be a problem, until someone would try to buy an Amazon product and my own local product and purchase them both on a single check-out page. 

Is there a platform or plug-in that would allow me to make a sale for both at the same time (Amazon Affiliate + Local Product), or should I fork my website with all the Amazon products on the main page, and a mini-site for the single product categories and its accessories?  But again, if someone wanted from Site A and the Fork, that probably wouldn't be able to work on the same check-out page.


I haven't settled on an Amazon Affiliate plug-in yet so I am not too far into the process.  I've been looking at Prosociate to populate my store.

tl;dr: Is there a plug in where users can check out with local products and also amazon affiliate products at the same time?

shopify,What bugs you about Shopify themes?,"Hey Shopifolk, I'm about to start developing my next Shopify theme and I'd love to hear some thoughts on the experience you've had with Shopify themes.

It can be hard to judge a theme value when browsing the landscape, since many of the great looking themes only seem good, due to the high quality photography they use. It's usually the moment you actually buy the theme and start using it, when all the good looking content is gone and you start noticing the problems with the theme.

What's the main thing that bugs you about the Shopify themes? What couldn't you find or found hard to use? What do you wish your theme had?

Once the theme is finished, I'll be sending out a link for a free download to all folks who are kind enough to take time and answer those questions. :)

ecommerce,Just getting started,"Hey Everybody!

 

I am pretty new to the ecommerce world, although I have been thinking about it and trying to develop products for over a year now. I am glad I found this place, and have already read through quite a few threads, and have gained just as much knowledge here in one day as I have anywhere else in the last 6 months.

 

So I think right now I am mainly interested in just telling my story, and hopefully getting some direction on what I should be doing next. Obviously if there was an easy answer, I wouldn't be here. I kinda started backwards with developing a product without even knowing it. I thought I had a great idea, so I utilized Shapeways to prototype multiple models and come up with something that I feel is very useful and offers some unique advantages other products of the same type don't... plus it is 3D printed using laser-sintering power.

 

Well the more I read on building a business online, the more I tried to get involved. Shapeways has a built in shop for their designers, so I marketed the products on their shop, but in the past year, I have only sold 4 products. I even tried facebook ads to drive the facebook page I created. There were plenty of clicks (like 80, which I think is big to me), but no bites. I obviously need more exposure. I bought a wordpress and bluehost domain and started to design a website where I could blog about all my ""great"" ideas and hopefully pull in traffic.

 

It isn't published yet, because I got sucked in to this guy named Ramit Sethi, perhaps you have heard of him. I almost bought his $2000 course on how to build a profitable online business. Now while I do not doubt his material, I would rather spend $2000 on BUIILDING the business right now, plus I don't exactly have that laying around.

 

He made building a business sound so easy, so when I took tidbits of his and others information about testing the market, I learned about adwords and started a campaign just a few days ago to drive traffic to the shapeways shop. so far in three days, $5.71 has been spent, over 43,000 ad views, but only 17 clicks of the ad. I had to figure out how to implement google analytics, but after getting it installed today, two of the recent clicks lasted less than 1 second on the page. So far, this is depressing for me, but from what I have been reading on here, SEO and PPC tend to take a few months to test markets and product validation, and a larger budget than I really want to spend.

 

Anyways, I know that was long, but I have used this product around town for awhile and I keep getting compliments on it, so I know it grabs peoples attention. I went on to Google Trends the other day, and the term for the product shows a growing or trending market, so I know it shows promise, and using Shopifys excellent definitive guide to building a business, I know the product shows promise.

 

Maybe I am getting ahead of myself here, but it seems like building an online business can take a couple years, with few exceptions of overnight successes. I don't want a get rich quick scheme, I am in it for the long haul, but am I on the right track? Should I finish publishing my blog and start writing? What kind of conversion rates should I expect on views and clicks?

 

I hope I am not trying to sound ""needy"". I am willing to learn and put in the time, I guess this just all got in my head in the wrong order. Thank you to anyone who listens. Onwards and Upwards!",7,2,2016-08-06,ECOM,0.031378213316202164,0.9241983890533447,0.04442334920167923

I recently started developing a website using Squarespace and it is shaping up quite nicely. I am a first time website creator and business owner. I have spent hours and hours getting the website to be ready to preview to affiliates before It actually becomes an official website. I just have a few questions.

When applying for an ABN (Australian Business Number) Would the ecommerce website be considered 

1. Individual (sole trader)
2. Company, Partnership, Trust or other organisation
3. Superannuation entity (I'm pretty sure this isn't the one)

Before I send out applications to affiliates I plan on using for the website, Is it bad to use examples of real products currently on the market? even if it is for the sole purpose of an example.

And also

So for months I've been doing research (suppliers, marketing, platforms et al) with a view to opening my own online store for a fairly niche product. I've been spurred on by stories of two similar online retailers earning 7-figure revenues and similarly high profits in their first years. 

My biggest problem is my location - Botswana. With that comes incredibly high shipping rates for near-acceptable times. I can't price the product past a certain amount ($10-$11 on par with competition) or else I risk alienating almost any potential customer, but I want to offer free shipping knowing its importance in driving sales, however, that would destroy any profit margin I have.

A potential strategy could be to sell only to the US (big market + savings on shipping if it's all to one place), but I risk losing out to a huge (and bigger) European and Asian market, and a growing African one.

I've written an eBook and will be turning that information into an online video course, both of which I plan to sell. I already own the domain I want to use. I'm very familiar with Wordpress and have built 5-6 websites from templates. I was originally thinking I would build another WordPress site but I'm not sure that's the best option. I'm also not sure where I should have the site hosted, because with any luck, it will get a fair amount of traffic in the future. I use GoDaddy for all my other websites but I've found they are not super reliable (slow load times, occasionally the sites won't load at all!). I think this is because I'm on a shared hosting plan, so I share a server with a bunch of other sites. 

I'd like my website to do two things: 1) Sell visitors on the benefits of purchasing my digital products and 2) Once they've purchased a product, have a members only section of the site where they can take the e-course (aka - watch the videos I'm going to create) and download the course materials (study notes, section questions, etc). 

So my questions are:

1) What do you suggest I use to build the site? Wix? Shopify? Wordpress (with the Easy Digital Downloads plugin)? Squarespace? I'm not opposed to learning a new platform or paying someone to help me get started with a new platform.

ecommerce,How do you handle explaining duty tax on international shipments?,"In the past, anytime anyone asked me about paying potential duty tax, I told them the truth... I don't know. I've told them I don't know if they'll pay, and if they do pay, I don't know how much it is. From my experience, it is an almost impossible thing to predict. Sometimes they won't charge people anything, and then if they do... the fee can vary greatly. And that's even if it's the same product to the same country. Customs people basically seem to wing it. So I'm certainly not going to give somebody a number, and then have them blame me when it is more.

So recently I had something go to the Netherlands. My gut told me there was something weird about the guy, and I actually sort of tried to talk him out of the purchase. But he was adamant about getting it. He asked us to devalue the shipment. I explained we can't do that, because then if it was lost... we wouldn't be able to claim anything. He ordered anyway. So today, I come in to a claim this guy has filed with PayPal and they took the money back. He claimed the duty was $220 on a $139.95 item, and the box was supposedly empty. I think the empty box part is BS. Why would they deliver an empty box, and why would he pay $220 in taxes for an empty box? But I actually looked it up, and sure enough... it did come out to about $220 in tax. That is insane. So now I'm thinking... What am I going to tell people from now on, if they ask about duty tax. Tell them it could be more than the item is worth? Nobody would buy anything. Not to mention, it might not actually turn out to be anything in some cases.",13,3,2016-08-09,ECOM,0.0459090955555439,0.9200757741928101,0.03401513025164604

woocommerce,Product with 2 variations that depend on each other,"I run an art store for my work on woocommerce. 

I got it set up to make prints at various sizes and prices using variations and attributes. I'm wondering if there's a way to add another layer where a person can also select if they want to get the picture framed. The issue is the framing costs is completely dependent on the size they chose. So if they pick an 8x12 print, there's a specific price of $39 for a frame for that size, and the price would change for an 11x14 and so on. I have many images of different sizes and ratios, so I can't just pick a universal number and charge that.

ecommerce,Approach brands to sell on my store but no capital for MOQs your help needed,"Hi all,

I am building what will be my future ecommerce business which is based around a very specific niche with a very clear mission and target market. I am working around the clock doing all the work that needs to be done before I can start approaching the brands I would like to sell (building the website everything minus the actual products, creating relevant content, coming up with marketing strategies for online and offline, etc etc).

My big question to you is: my funds are very limited, how do I approach brands and convince them to stock their products? I don't have the money to commit to MOQ purchases but at the same time, I don't want them to ship directly to my future customers for several reasons:

a) want to keep my customer database for my business and not share it for obvious reasons
b) I want to centralize my logistics here in the UK in one warehouse where I would stock all the different products so I can have full control with regards to order fulfillment.

The only good thing I have thought of is pay just for shipping to my warehouse upfront and then pay the products with long payment terms 90/120 days, which would allow me to sell and hopefully cover the cost. However, there still might be high risk involved.

What are your suggestions/experiences? I know it's a tough one but if it was easy, then I guess everyone would start their business overnight!

ecommerce,Ingenious (and simple AF) tips for mastering customer touch points,"Working for years in Ecommerce sphere I understood one very important thing - online shoppers are becoming more sophisticated and seek for something unique.
Being professional and creative, offering to-the-point service to the clients at every step of online buying – decision making, purchase process, after-sale service – is what makes a truly nifty customer experience.
I saw many businesses but one thing that was different - understanding the importance of every interaction with a client, i.e customer touchpoints. 

I grasped a dozen of killer examples of truly successful techniques to hook clients on every step of online buying and would like to share them with you all. 

**Look beyond mediocre customer service** 

* Envision a real person behind every order and help them solve the problem. 

* Talk to customers their language. Change your boring “The item will be delivered by..” into “Hey, start tracking the weather. You’ll have your new cool boat by next weekend! Happy sailing!” 

* Be ready to give more than expected on specific occasions. 
* Follow up every product shipment asking for feedback and offering additional assistance. 
* Use customers’ feedback to constantly enhance your service and raise your own bar for the standard.

**Thank your customers heartily. I mean it!**

* Add a handwritten note or small present to every order.
* Include a beautiful postcard signed by your stuff.
* Congratulate your customer on any holiday whether it’s Christmas or World Chocolate Day (11th, July).
* Enclose a personal note on behalf of CEO for making the first\10th\valuable purchase.

**Set up a subscription model for your customers.**
A truly remarkable example is Dollar Shave Club with its club membership and subscription model.  Within four years it has become so successful that DSC recently nailed down a 1$ billion deal when it was acquired by Unilever, which is planning to use the similar subscription model for its other brands.

* Choose a platform to create a community of brand ambassadors (Facebook or website page, or better embed one into another).
* Encourage your customers to share photos, videos, reviews, feedback about you product(s).
* Add exclusiveness to your community by giving its members privileged access to the latest promo campaigns and secret sales.

It's not everything, if you like it I will share more tips in comments. But firstly I want to gather your opinions and feedback - do you personally use these little hacks in your business? 
I would like you brainstorm more creative ideas and put them into action. And let you business flourish and get loyal customers akin to Daenerys’ no-chances-to-count army!",3,9,2016-08-11,ECOM,0.030118227005004883,0.9334679841995239,0.036413803696632385

Together we operate a local EDM music festival held once per year, steadily growing and with around 1000 attendees this year.

Is drop shipping a good bet, or should we invest in inventory wholesale? Any tips? The items we need the most are rave outfits and clothing for girls.

ecommerce,How do you create a customer base pre launch likely to convert without having the products listed?,"Hi all,

Following my post from yesterday, I have one last burning question which I think can benefit all members of this great community.

So, to keep things short, here we go:

- you have the idea for your new online venture which has been validated by market research and by general feedback/consensus

- you have everything ready and in place in order to start approaching suppliers and convince them to let you sell their products (website, branding, business plan, etc.)

QUESTION: How would you/did you manage to create a tangible pool of future customers that will likely convert into sales once you go/went live? I ask because a) can give you even greater leverage when negotiating with suppliers and convince them to come onboard your winning project b) gives you future business owner a bit more confidence boost that your products/idea will sell.

I don't want to use a monthly subscription service like Shopify. I'm not a developer, but I can do basic stuff. 

Anyone have any suggestions, recommendations?

For reference, the site is www.divina-denuevo.com

With an oversaturated market like that (let's face it, people don't need another clothing brand), what would you guys suggest in terms of SEO. 

Go along with the usual most used keywords (hip tshirt, cool tshirt, comfortable tshirt) and implement them in your tags and meta tags (along with product descriptions)?

Or 

Use keywords related to a specific niche in combination with the product, for example: boys' skating tshirt, grafiti artist tshirt gear, olympic figure skater tshirt etc.?

ecommerce,New to ecommerce - My ads are getting clicks but no conversions,"Hey guys,

I'm brand new to e-commerce (Please be gentle and use lube :)) and just created my first site using optimizepress to sell online tarot card readings. Looking for some feedback as I've run a couple Facebook ads and I think I'm getting a good CTR, but it's not converting into sales at all.  

My Facebook Ad:

$5.00 spent

CTR: 5.23%

CPC: $0.06

Total link clicks: 86

Impressions: 1645

From what I can see, I think my ad is fine and succesfully got a reasonable CTR/CPC, but people just didn't like what they saw once they got to my page. [Here's an image of the ad](http://imgur.com/a/DoB4S) - if anything I could change there would make a difference in conversion. I targeted Women between 20-35 in the US who are interested in  Tarot, Tarot Readings, etc and excluded people who are interested in Free Psychic Reading, Tarot Gratis.

My ad linked directly to my sales page http://spiritualgreatness.com/online-tarot-reading 

I know my page probably doesn't look the most professional, but I'm not sure what to change about it specifically to make people want to buy. So I guess that's where I'm looking for the most advice.

Some ideas where I think I might need improvement, but not sure how:

- Background colour / general theme, generally need to make it look more sleek and professional instead of like a Geocities site.

- Move product links (call to action) to top of the page so they are visible when the page loads? My concern is that people will see the price tag and leave without reading any further, if they don't see my description/explanation first.

- Should I add ""Buy Now"" / ""Add To Cart"" / Paypal buttons below each item, or is it clear enough where the customer needs to click in order to buy?

- Pricing probably seems high to an outsider, but I've based it on what other similar sites have their services priced at. I've put links to some of my competition in a comment below, since the sub rules look like I shouldn't include those in my main post. I can reduce the price of my $99 items to as low as $49 though if you think that would make the sales. 

- Different way to lay out the products? 

- Maybe running a $5 Facebook ad just isn't enough advertising to expect a high-ticket sale on a $99 item and I should just advertise more?

- What should I do to build more trust from viewers? Am I just not going to get enough trust from a Facebook ad and I should be funneling them through an email list where I get people to sign up for free weekly horoscopes first?

TLDR: What are the top changes I can make to my sales page and ad approach that you think will increase conversion the most?

I also ran one ad prior to this that directed to my main page with a video explaining the site, hoping it would build rapport and make people more likely to purchase, but it performed even worse and no one even clicked through to the sales page. I know the video on the main page is pretty garbage and the jump-cuts look awful and I'm going to be re-doing it, but I wonder if a video at the top of my Online Tarot Reading sales page explaining what I have available would help make sales?",13,3,2016-08-14,ECOM,0.035740457475185394,0.9270060062408447,0.037253495305776596

woocommerce,Issue with managing stock and variables.,"I am new to to woocommerce and hope this is possible just not sure how. I am desiging a new website for a local theatre company that sells tickets to its shows online. The current structure using woo works like this:

Show: Much Ado About Nothing
Product: Much Ado Friday September 9th @7:30pm
Variables General Admission, Students/Seniors/Military.

This particular performance runs 3 weekends so will have 9 products in total. One for each day. This is the only way I have found to be able to manage stock on a nightly basis. I could set an inventory(From a Product Level) of 175 that would apply to both variables. The thing that I dislike about this is is I fear the products page might become a little confusing for everyone. When you click on the show a page with 9 different dates and times appear all with the same show(product) image. 

I originally had created it like this:

Show: Much Ado About Nothing
Product: Much Ado About Nothing Sept 9-25
Variables: September 9 General Admission, Sept 9 Student/Senior/Military, Sept 10 General Admission, and so on.

So when you clicked on the show to purchase a ticket it took you to a simpler looking page with one drop down menu of all the show date and times. The issue with this is I could not manage inventory on a nightly basis. I couldn't manage the stock from a product Level because I cannot control how many a person could buy for a particular night. And if I tried to manage stock from a variable level I had to split my nightly stock amount(175) between the two possible ticket prices (General, Student/Senior/Military). But then one could ""sell out"" even thought technically it was not sold out.

Is there a way to set up this product where I can have it displayed all in one single drop down menu but be able to control the stock on a nightly basis? Or is there a way to even have multiple drop down menus(One for each night) but all displayed on the same page?

Here is a link to what I know works but isn't ideal: http://cctshows.com/thoroughly-modern-millie-tickets/

(You clicked the show you want tickets for and it takes you here, then you click the date you want tickets for and it takes you here: http://cctshows.com/product/thoroughly-modern-millie-september-9th-730pm/  Where you then select the price.)

Here is a link to what I would like, but currently doesn't work correctly: http://cctshows.com/product/the-complete-works-of-william-shakespeare-abridged/

(You clicked the show you want tickets for and it takes you to the page where you select the date and price. One less step, one less chance for confusion and incorrect orders being placed.)

Is there a way to have my cake and eat it too? Thanks for any help and guidance in this!",0,2,2016-08-14,ECOM,0.07508977502584457,0.9005665183067322,0.0243437048047781

We've had an order on our website for close to £100. The customer paid by card over the weekend but the fraud score is a positive number (110). We don't often have this (perhaps 4 in the past 5 years) but on those occasions Sage declined the transaction - this time they've accepted it.

The shipping address doesn't match the billing; this isn't a red flag for us as quite often our customers get orders delivered to workplaces. What does jump out is when we go into detail on the fraud score.

""Telephone number appears on reported high risk list""
""Email address appears on reported high risk list""

Obviously we aren't going to send the item and will refund, however how would someone go about wording the email to send to the customer explaining the refund? 

It's not our job to be judge and jury so I don't want to be preaching the fraud score, however I can't just say ""sorry, out of stock"" as more often that not we're asked to hold orders until we can resupply.",9,5,2016-08-15,ECOM,0.10222284495830536,0.8693643808364868,0.028412794694304466

2) I plan to just use USPS for everything, unless someone has better idea for global shipping. Like USPS for United States, UPS better for international, etc.

3) Looking for an app that calculates shipping from my business address to all locations. There has to be a better way than hand typing every address in the world and seeing the exact cost for standard and priority and then making a flat rate to see if it indeed does cover the shipping cost of everything in that area.

This is the first time I am doing international shipping. How do I get a more affordable international shipping rate. I am finding the average is 20USD for my product. To me it seems it is a lot for customers.

I recently launched my apparel website http://missinglynxproject.com/ and have been getting really good engagement and some feedback but the sales have been rolling in very slowly.

ecommerce,"Just how important is it to find the perfect ""niche""? It's going to be the death of me.","I very much want to start a business and hopefully some day be my own boss. I have read so many books, articles, webinars, and my head is about to explode. Everybody and their dog has an opinion on what the key to having a successful online business is, and I feel that it's really starting to keep me from making a move at all because it's all about finding the ""perfect"" niche, the ""perfect"" website, and all the stars and planets in the universe must be properly aligned too. Look, I get putting thought into what you're going to sell, and of course you need to think about whether there is a market for it, but I feel that the experts make you feel like you need to conduct extensive research, do ""test products"" and other shit like that, and I really feel that many people that start businesses don't do things that way, at least at first. 

I feel that it's more about a person being interested in or having a passion for a certain something, and then they find a way to make that into a business. My business ideas aren't lofty or out-there. To start off, I would just like to start a simple t shirt business and see how that goes.

shopify,Clean That Code! Shopify Finally Creates Tags to Clean Up Liquid White-space! Here's how it works.,"If you're a big Liquid user, and if you're using Shopify, you will be, you may have noticed in your website's source code that the liquid code leaves an awful lot of whitespace. This is handy for developers to read through the code, but crawl bots like Google don't like it, the shorter the code, the better it is for SEO and other factors.

That's why Shopify have ***finally*** created a method to remove all of that white-space from your liquid code, and it's *really freaking* simple to do.

Within your code, if you've done much exploring, you'll have seen code like this:

    {% include 'snippet' %}

This is a logic tag, this is what produces all of that awful white-space.

To add these newly created tags to remove them, simply add a hyphen to the inner side of each percentage sign. Place it on the first percentage, it'll remove white-space before that liquid, place it on the last percentage, and it'll remove it after the liquid.

    {%- include 'snippet' -%}


**Before the tag**

      &lt;select class=""currency-picker cs-select cs-skin-rotate"" name=""currencies"" style=""display: inline; width: auto; vertical-align: inherit;""&gt;
  
  
      &lt;option value=""GBP"" selected=""selected""&gt;GBP&lt;/option&gt;
  
    
        &lt;option value=""INR""&gt;INR&lt;/option&gt;
    
  
    
  
    
        &lt;option value=""CAD""&gt;CAD&lt;/option&gt;
    
  
    
        &lt;option value=""USD""&gt;USD&lt;/option&gt;
    
  
    
        &lt;option value=""AUD""&gt;AUD&lt;/option&gt;
    
  
    
        &lt;option value=""EUR""&gt;EUR&lt;/option&gt;
    
  
    
        &lt;option value=""JPY""&gt;JPY&lt;/option&gt;
    
  
      &lt;/select&gt;

**And after the tag**

      &lt;select class=""currency-picker cs-select cs-skin-rotate"" name=""currencies"" style=""display: inline; width: auto; vertical-align: inherit;""&gt;&lt;option value=""GBP"" selected=""selected""&gt;GBP&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""INR""&gt;INR&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""CAD""&gt;CAD&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""USD""&gt;USD&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""AUD""&gt;AUD&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""EUR""&gt;EUR&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""JPY""&gt;JPY&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;

ecommerce,Case Study: Using Rewards and Facebook Groups to Get 1000 Orders in First Year,"Here is a case study that shows how one online retailer used Facebook groups and Rewards to get his first 1000 orders. Hope this is helpful to the community.

---&gt;

**It took Bruce Dally a mere two months to get his first 100 orders, selling drone parts online. Less than six months later, he had received his first 1000 orders.** 

Bruce sells parts to the drone racing market, a niche that consists of drone hobbyists who buy parts and build their own drones for racing. 

As the drone racing market grew, Bruce noticed that there was a lack of compact, high performance parts that worked well with existing drones.

*These are the kinds of parts that drone racers wanted the most, but no one was manufacturing them.* 

So Bruce began tinkering and designing his own parts and soon manufacturing them. 

He does no online advertising except spending some money sponsoring local drone races. Bruce’s fast growth was powered by using following tactics:

**Implemented a customer-friendly loyalty program to keep customers coming back**
Bruce tweaked his loyalty program in the following ways to convert new customers into repeat customers:

1. Bruce knew that by making it easy for customers to earn rewards, they were more likely to return. So Bruce chose the most [customer friendly rewards app](https://www.rewardcamp.com/) on the BigCommerce app store. He configured it so that every customer who placed an order, earned a cashback reward for their next order. This gave customers a reason to come back and they did. 

2. He configured the rewards app, so that customers would not have to redeem their rewards. It would be automatically added to their checkout cart. This surprised and delighted customers at the most important conversion point - during checkout.

3. Used rewards to brand his store. He called the rewards Bruce bucks and even created a humorous image of Bruce bucks. 

4. He setup the rewards app to send monthly reminders to those who did not spend their cashback rewards. This lead to customers who forgot, to return and order. 



**Used Facebook Groups to interact with customers and keep them engaged**

Bruce created a Facebook group as soon as he opened his online store to keep his customers engaged. He followed these eight principles to grow his Facebook group. 
 
1.	Bruce never added anyone to his group without their permission, including customers.

2.	Since there was no activity in the group in the early days, Bruce would post content every 3-4 days. Mostly this included videos of him building drones or flying drones. 

3.	Whenever anyone posted in his group, he would respond right away. If someone posted a picture or a comment, he immediately gave it a like or commented. 

4.	He was a part of several public groups in the drone niche. Instead of blatantly promoting his products or group, he offered advice and helped others in the group. This established his personal reputation in the community.

5.	He performed a giveaway promotion in one of the other groups. But first, he asked the permission of the group moderator. Once he got their permission, he did a simple giveaway promotion. The giveaway promotion was very successful and lead to those members being curious and checking out this group. 

6.	After a period of time, customers began posting pictures of products they bought in the Facebook group. Soon they were also cross-posting these images to other drone related groups, giving Bruce free publicity.
 
7.	If arguments broke up in the group, he’d handle it by sending private messages to both parties and asking them to calm things down. 

8.	Bruce also does not allow talk of competitors in his groups, just like no one goes to Target and starts promoting Walmart. If he sees anything he does not like, he quietly deletes it without making big fuss about it.",0,12,2016-08-19,ECOM,0.0404546745121479,0.9210508465766907,0.038494497537612915

woocommerce,Best Way to Achieve Multiple Shipping Methods per order?,"**EDIT - 8/19 - 2:15PM:**

Okay, I purchased and installed the Plugin listed below, and so far it seems to offer what we're looking for. The only thing I have to figure out is how to keep the plugin from compounding the drop-ship rate with UPS charges for a drop-ship item, rather than drop ship rates on drop ship item and ups rates for non-dropship item - The way I tried configuring against this yields a condition where only the drop ship rate is applied again. Still not perfect, but we're getting close!


&gt;**EDIT - 8/19/2016 - 12:00PM:**

&gt;Has anybody had a chance to work with the following plugin?
http://tablerateshipping.com/

&gt;They provide a 14-Day full refund on a $39 purchase, so it can't hurt to try. I'll try this and update with results.

&gt;&gt;Hello All,

&gt;&gt;We're nearing the release of our website, however I'm hitting a wall when configuring shipping - What I need to achieve is the ability to allow multiple shipping methods per order.

&gt;&gt;The reason for this is that we offer several products that are drop-shipped from external sources, so they are sent directly to the customer from the original manufacturer. We get charged a $60.00 flat rate drop-ship fee from our suppliers when they drop-ship for us - This becomes a problem when our UPS Shipping Method Plugin (WooThemes Official) quotes the shipping rates based on our location to the customer, as the cost will often be significantly lower for the customer than the $60 charge that we receive. I can set a Flat Rate Shipping class to the Items that need to be drop-shipped, however, this overrides the UPS rates for any additional items in their cart that are not in this flat-rate class, setting them to free shipping unless they have the flat-rate class enabled (Which would not be appropriate regardless).

&gt;&gt;Can anybody send me in the right direction? I've been trying to accomplish this for months on and off, and nothing that I've found seems to remedy my issue. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;&gt;Thanks!",1,3,2016-08-19,ECOM,0.1521087884902954,0.8117878437042236,0.036103419959545135

ecommerce,How can I track this type of inventory?,"Hi,

I am looking for a warehouse management system solution for my e-commerce based company. However, my industry is unique in that I need to track 2 ""types"" of inventory, which I'm finding difficult to do from any of the solutions I'm interested in.

The dilemma is that we specialize in a type of wiring that comes in all sorts of random lengths when its manufactured. Some tubing arrive in 50 ft, some in 51 ft, others in 52 ft, etc. It is completely random. However, when we sell it to the public, we are selling it in customizable lengths. So a customer can order 3 ft and we would cut it off one of the preexisting tubes. 

As a result, we are looking to figure out a way to track the number of feet on each individual tube as well as how many tubes we have available.

Example of what the tracking would entail:

* Serialization (or SKU?) of Tube #1 | Total Feet on Tube of WireX | SKU of WireX in variation A
* Serialization (or SKU?) of Tube #2 | Total Feet on Tube of WireX | SKU of WireX in variation A
* Serialization (or SKU?) of Tube #3 | Total Feet on Tube of WireX | SKU of WireX in variation A
...

This would allow us to see how many tubes we have of a particular wire, how many feet of continuous wire we have on each particular tube, and also the total number feet across all tubes for a particular SKU. 

Do any of you have any creative ways we could potentially do this? I am looking at solutions such as Shiphero and SKUVault, but even their reps are having a difficult time drafting a feasible solution for this.

Thanks for the help!

ecommerce,Tarot guy again – still not getting any conversions and back for more advice,"Hey guys,

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/4xog5j/new_to_ecommerce_my_ads_are_getting_clicks_but_no/) a couple weeks ago and got lots of great advice.


Since then I've made a whole new landing page and implemented a lot of things you suggested:

- Just one product on the page

- Paypal buttons

- Build an emotional connection with the customer (picture of myself – so they know who is doing the reading.)

- Greater description of myself and what is being offered.

- Price greatly reduced, from my cheapest offer being $25 down to $5.

- More modern/professional look to the page


[Here is a link to my new page](http://spiritualgreatness.com/online-tarot-reading-promo/)

I ran a couple more sets of $5 Facebook ads to direct traffic to this page -- 97 clickthroughs total, but still no conversions even when offering a clear money-back guarantee. My Facebook ad contains the same image featured on my page and a description that's cohesive with the site.

Any more advice on what I can do to get my first sale? Improvements to the page to increase conversion or any other suggestions?  

Here are some possible next steps I am considering:

- Reduce price from $5 to $0.99 (very low barrier to entry, builds clients, but still weeds out people who just want free stuff.)

- Create a mailing list offering a free weekly horoscope, create a sales funnel and sell later.

- Offer a free reading if they join my mailing list, create a sales funnel and sell later. (More time intensive.)

- Optimize my current page to convert better - how?

ecommerce,Help with starting a new ecommerce store,"OK first post on reddit actually. Long time lurker, mostly on subjects unrelated to ecommerce, but my 9 - 5 job is managing an eBay store with a business partner with an inventory of 900+ vintage and antique car parts since March 2015. 

I need help. Idk wtf I'm doing. Some idea but mostly no idea.

So we want to have our own website for all the vintage car parts which are currently ~950 listings on eBay. Ideally we want all of our products displayed with a simple Paypal/Credit card checkout. We want to slowly get away from relying on eBay because they suck and just pay monthly for the site.

Here's the problem. Seems like all the ecommerce tools for bulk importing all of your existing eBay listings all at once are just widgets that you put on your existing site that brings you directly to the eBay listing and you have no choice but to purchase it from eBay. I want to know if there's anything out there that will allow me to bulk import all of the data itself from eBay (the photos and descriptions) but instead of bringing you directly to the eBay listing, displays the photos and descriptions in a simple format and allows you to pay through Paypal or Credit Card. ... Otherwise I literally have to take screen shots of all the older eBay listings (because eBay doesn't allow you to save the photos and we don't have the original files anymore... I've got the newer photo files for something like 300 listings since I've been working in this store and thats it...), crop down the photos and copy and paste all the descriptions or physically get the items out of storage and re-photograph them which is a huge ridiculous undertaking but if that's what we have to do, I guess that's what we'll do.

I've been looking into
Magneto - I read its not great for beginners sooo...
3dCart - Good for beginners, you can use your own domain it seems which is what we want, but its 65/month for what we need which is too much
Shopify - I don't really know much about it, but I guess its popular
Google sites - You can't use paypal bc they're a competitor so f that

Could you please comment on the website :) We think it is looking good, however we need more visitors and most of all, convert visitors to sales! You think we need to change the shop? I think this feature is our main problem. Too complicated? More direct text?

ecommerce,Is this a scam?,"Hi,

I run a small body care &amp; home fragrance site. We sell things like body butters, body scrubs, scented candles etc etc.

I'm based in New Zealand and, while I have the capacity to accept, pack &amp; send international orders, so far I've only focused on selling within NZ only.

Today out of the blue I received an email from some dude who explains that he's living in the Netherlands and he wants to know if I can ship to his country, and if I also accept MasterCard.

Sure, no problem buddy. I send him a link with the delivery fees for his part of the world. I explain we can accept MasterCard via our website, or we can also take PayPal too. I half expect not to hear back from him as the delivery costs from NZ to the rest of the world are pretty high.

12 hours later he replies, he is ecstatic. He sends through an email order for 12x of our EACH most popular items (so 72 items in total). For reference, these items retail for roughly USD$5 - USD$35. A very attractive order from my perspective.

Immediately red flags arise because he didn't attempt to place an order online via the usual processes. To be fair, we intentially only hold low stock at any one time (typically between 2 - 5 units of an item).

Though, this just smells like a scam.

I'm part of some business networking groups online and I've heard that a few businesses in New Zealand have been scammed lately. Their story goes that an overseas buyer will place and order and pay for it. Then I'm not sure what happens, but somehow they claim that they never receive the goods and PayPal (or whatever gateway) processes a refund, and the business either never sees the money again or has to fight tooth and nail to prove that they did send the parcel.

It just seems too good to be true.

If anyone can give some perspective or anything on how to proceed I'd be very grateful.

I guess ultimately my question is, how can I receive payment without any risk? For example, should I perhaps ask for a direct bank transfer into my account? Is a direct bank transfer even safe, or is it still possible for him to reverse the funds somehow?

What method of payment can I use that ensures that I won't get ripped off after sending the order?

Thanks guys :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/update

I called my bank, which confirmed that a direct transfer into my account can't be reversed without my authority. Therefore I've emailed him back to advise that due to his order size we require direct bank transfer. Currently waiting to hear back...

Still feels like a scam and will assume so until proven otherwise.

It feels like I've found a very top selling product to sell for my second store. I called the company that makes the product and they allowed me to dropship.

1. It's ranked 1200 on Amazon's Health category
2. Has +1000 Amazon reviews
3. Established brand so I can spy on their own ads, there are a lot of videos of the product
4. A lot of watchers in ebay
5. good profit margin


Negative ( in my opinion)
1. nobody's really selling it on shopify

2. My direct competitors have 500 reviews on their site for the same product. Not a shopify

ecommerce,I need a solution for a Digital Downloads only eCommerce Website,"Hello r/eCommerce

I need advice on starting an eCommerce website that sells Digital Products for Download only.

**About me:**

a) I have years of freelance web design and little developer experience with both raw code (html,css,php,javascript) and WordPress, but no real eCommerce / CDN hosting experience.

b) I want to focus on design and promotion , not low level E commerce functionality and plan on choosing the best third party pre built solution.

c) This is a personal start up with a hobby budget, I am willing to spend a little where necessary and for significant convenience.

d) I will not have any products to sell starting out, but I plan to start blogging for traffic, credibility and page rank before that.

e) I have had bad experiences with WordPress sites being DDOS attacked and hosting companies having no help to give.


**Here are my wishful requirements:**
 
a) I would like to be able to process credit cards from around the world, not strictly PayPal

b) I need full control of the design, i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript plugins etc

c) A Member system that integrates with blog comments and allows previous purchases to be re downloaded, wishlists etc

d) Cart System with coupon code inputs for discounts

e) Scheduled product release and discounts

f) Dashboard with analytics and sales info

g) Shared Revenue on product purchases for authorized third party products within my site (not affiliate)

h) Email Subscription integration

i) I have to be able to use my own domain name

**Questions in context:**

a) What setup should i go with?

  harness my wordpress skills with plugins or go with another setup for security, functionality or ease reasons?

b) What does using a CDN bring to the table ?",7,4,2016-08-26,ECOM,0.04254375398159027,0.9320712089538574,0.025385085493326187

woocommerce,Displaying subcategories on main product page,"I have spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to do this and I'm running out of ideas and going a bit crazy. I need to display subcategories on the shop page, not the parent categories. I have tried various filters and actions to accomplish this but nothing is really working. Here is what I have that almost gets it right: 

    add_filter( 'get_terms', 'get_subcategory_terms', 10, 3 );
    function get_subcategory_terms( $terms, $taxonomies, $args  ) {
     $new_terms = array();
      if ( ! is_admin() &amp;&amp; is_shop() ) {
        foreach ( $terms as $term ) {
          if (  in_array( $term-&gt;slug, array( 'current-probes', 'accessories' ) ) ) {
            $new_terms[] = $term;
          }
        }
        $terms = $new_terms;
      }
      return $terms;
    
    }
    
Unfortunately I actually need to display the child categories of 'current-probes' and 'accessories.' I have also tried this: 

    add_filter( 'get_terms', 'get_subcategory_terms', 10, 3 );
    function get_subcategory_terms( $terms, $taxonomies, $args ) {
      $new_terms = array();
      if ( ! is_admin() &amp;&amp; is_shop() ) {
    	  $terms = array( 'test-lead', 'tlar', 'flex-ct'); 
       			foreach ( $terms as $term ) {
            		$new_terms[] = $term;
        }
    
        	$terms = $new_terms;
      }
      		return $terms;
    }
    
This actually displays the correct subcategories ( they are specified in the $terms array). The problem with this is that it displays everything but the thumbnail and title. There are 4 php notices of ""Trying to get property of non-object."" It seems that the wc_get_template() part isn't happening.

ecommerce,Need help getting my store online,"I have a small brick and mortar retail store - the last year or so has been brutal, and my best avenue for expansion is to go online. 

Problem is, I'm just so busy running a business I don't have a lot of time to research my options, let alone build a custom site. 

Unfortunately everything I have seen looks... corny. These Shopify sites look like they're made for micro-scale businesses to sell their limited number of products out of their 300 sq ft  Brooklyn apartment. I've got a 8000sqft warehouse with over 1000 items I need to sell (about 10 categories with between 20 and 250 items per category)  I don't see the typical etsy-esque grid style UX being effective for what I'm doing. 

I also have a walk-in retail operation that would need to track inventory and local sales (tax, no shipping, cash, etc.) 

So what are my options? I've looked at Shopify and Magento so far, Shopify seems geared more towards small online storefronts with a dozen or so items, and Magento seems like it could work, but it's costs and lead times are a bit intimidating... one of my suppliers uses Net Suite, but again, looks great, just don't know how it scales down as they market towards much larger clients it seems. 

I'm 100% open to solicitations and private discussions in more detail of what I want, need, and expect.  I would expect to pay/contract someone part-time, remotely is an option, to help with on-going issues as well... I'm not looking for a free or free-mium system, but can't spend $50,000 a year on this either (yet).

The subject on which our company is founded is something still considered a little taboo (in Tahiti anyway). 

We do menstrual cups :)

Here is our site: http://nudeup.co

we are a tiny company(just me and my fiancée), we have experienced relative success here in French Polynesia, but we are struggling with international sales from our site. 

We spend about 200-400usd on Facebook per month(small target audiences 150,000max all with strong relative interests). We receive mediocre interaction with our content marketing(we only started this month.) we get around 200hits to the site per day. These are 80% from Facebook. We are about to launch and Adwords campaign at the end of this week.

We would really appreciate any insight/critiques that you guys have for our online store.

ecommerce,Opening a multi-vendor marketplace and am brainstorming how to handle payments from customers and payouts to vendors minus our commission and am looking for some advice.,"We initially were going to have it to where as soon as the customer places an order, the vendor gets their take of the money, 90% of the sale price, and we get our commission, 10% of the sale price.

But then we considered what would happen if a vendor went rogue or whatever and didn't ship out an item to a customer. We would then be responsible for that cost and would have to refund the customer out of our pocket. So now we're considering holding payment for two weeks which should give our vendors enough time to ship out an item to a customer and mark the order as shipped. We would then manually do the payouts on a set date, every two weeks.

I'd be happy go get your help on the following, it would be highly appreciated! 

I am looking for some articles/posts on companies who want to increase their sales online. The case is that this company doesn't own a real ecommerce website. They work in a different way that they sell to other retailers and the retailers sell to the end costumers. That means that the company doesn't sell directly to the end costumer.

How exactly does this call? What should I be looking for? I am not aware of any terminology or the right terms for this case.
Would you know about any examples to this case? Or on what should I look for?

The company would like to increase sales of their product – but they don't operate a real online store of their own. They have many other sites that are selling their product. 

Moreover, there are also big companies that sell only to a a distributor and the distributor sells to other stores. Is this a different case?

I'm working on an eCommerce site. Here are a few things:

 - I would like to have a succinct niche-specific statement heading the page. Good idea?

 - We have a long eBay history. This is probably usable to give our site a little more authority somehow?

 - I am aware pagespeed is abysmal. I assume it's because of a cheaper hosting option used - shared hosting. I've used tools that test pagespeed and it takes a good 2-4 seconds before the server even starts serving content. The time after that I am capable of optimizing myself.

 - Traffic is starting to climb and emails are trickling in but we are having difficulty converting.

Instead, they desire the convenience of having their questions—regardless of complexity—answered concisely and instantaneously. If an answer to their question isn’t found quickly, 57% of customers will abandon their purchase.

The purpose for Ad Group 2 is to generate new closely related search terms for ""bicycle pump"". Those new search terms will then be added as new key terms to bid on. Negative-exact-match for ""bicycle pump"" keyword in Ad Group 2 makes sure that only Ad Group 1 can show impressions on that exact keyword.
