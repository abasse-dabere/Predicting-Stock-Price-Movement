ecommerce,Looking for advice on name/domain for eCommerce Startup,"I'd like to start my own eCommerce business and am in the very early stages of research and planning. I'd ideally like to host my own store selling mainly beauty products, cosmetics and some home accessories. 

I'm really struggling to come up with a name that doesn't sound cheesy/isn't already taken and am looking for some advice. I'd like to know at what stage I should be choosing a name and getting a domain? Is it important at this stage?

Also is it better to have an abstract name or a name that contains a relevant keyword such as 'beauty'. I'm personally not too keen on stores with 'beauty' in the title.

So far I've had a few ideas but those that I have thought of the .com domains are either taken or premium, I'm in the UK but eventually would like to ship internationally, would having a .co.uk be an issue?

Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!",8,5,2014-06-01,ECOM,0.016174718737602234,0.8869661092758179,0.09685918688774109
ecommerce,which system should I use,"Hi

I want to start my own company. To distribute my product I want to use a ecomm platform. I basically collect and resell fashion. The main requirement for the store is, that i'm able to describe a manufacturer and link them to certain products. I looked in to Shopify as a hosted solution but this wan't work for my purposes. I'm playing also around with Opencart because I have already a host for other sites.

My biggest handicap is, that I can't code and as I said It's only a distribution channel for me. I want to concentrate on the product and not on the webshop itself.

So any recommendation from you guys? Would be so thankful :-)",13,3,2014-06-01,ECOM,0.023128630593419075,0.9357365965843201,0.04113474115729332

ecommerce,I will setup your metrics/analytics and tell you exactly what to do to increase your growth for FREE if you fill out this short survey (only accepting 2 businesses),"Hey guys, I'm not a huge fan of filling out survey's myself except when there's a great incentive for doing so. I'm offering to setup your metrics, show you what you should be tracking based on your current stage of growth you're in, and tell you exactly what you should do based on what the data says.

If you are an experienced advertiser or marketer, this is NOT for you. If you are a product guy, programmer, are clueless when it comes to metrics and analytics or conversions and sales funnels, then this IS for you.

I'm only going to help out TWO businesses which will receive on-going support for two months. However, you must have revenue, or sell something and have some traction. Absolutely NO media or transaction-based (marketplaces) companies (sorry guys, maybe in the future). So an E-commerce shop or something of that nature would be best. If you have analytics setup already that's fine.

My background is in Internet Marketing (SEO, Content Marketing, PPC optimization, etc.), and growth hacking (I hate that word).
I would love it if even if you have a media company or whatnot that you still fill the survey out, but you don't have to.

Contact me on here when you've filled out the survey and link me to your website/tell me a little about your business and I'll get in touch
Remember I'm only offering this to 2 businesses, so don't miss out! Who I decide to help out will be randomly chosen. If you reach out to me and all slots are filled I'll let you know and if you're interested I'll keep you up to date on when exactly this will be a publicly available service.

You can find the survey here, I appreciate everyone who takes time out of their day to complete this: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KCTDQSC",0,0,2014-06-02,ECOM,0.024634400382637978,0.9292998909950256,0.04606565833091736

ecommerce,Any Shopify store owners want to try out my new Shopify app?,"Growing Shopify stores eventually need a customer relationship management (CRM) system to handle and organize customer support emails.

Migrating to a CRM like Desk.com or ZenDesk.com requires you to learn a new system and in some cases requires your customer to change the way they interact with you by having to log into a different system.

I want to give Shopify store owners the organization and quick access to customer information like a CRM, without having to replace the system they already know: their email inbox.

So I built Email Inbox CRM. Email Inbox CRM is a Chrome extension that turns email inboxes into a CRM. It plugs into your Shopify store database so you can pull up customer and order info without having to leave your email inbox - speeding up and organizing your customer support emails.

Here's a demo video:

http://youtu.be/9CTqBpztFR8

Here are some screenshots:

The app is free right now and if you're a Shopify store owner that needs help organizing your customer support emails please check it out: https://apps.shopify.com/email-inbox-crm

If you use it please let me know what you think by writing a review :)

dropship,Handmade toys manufacturer looking for sellers,"Hi to everyone.
I just made an account here to be able to connect with established sellers, ask questions &amp; offer our products for dropshipping.

What do you need from the manufacturer?

What can we do to make things as smooth as possible other than ship and make them?

We are a toy manufacturer based in Thailand, we make hand made high quality children's educational toys from fabric and wood. Our products are in the range of 15-50 dollars and some specialty items in the 100-200 usd range. There should be roughly 100% profit margin for the seller, depending on the item but this is just our estimation.


Our products are hand made and of high quality and craftsmanship, unique **and there is none of them available in the market places like ebay**.


If you are looking for something special to sell and know how to reach customers who would be interested in our toys, please send message to me so we can discuss more. We would be interested to work with someone who has strong background in dropshipping and can really get the products available to many customers, has his own contact network, possibly Facebook groups and followers already.




**Briefly about us**

* We got over 150 different, unique hand made toys in our catalog. The toys are aimed to children aged  from 1 to 6 and have been designed to help with learning; ie. Numbers, words, coordination etc.

* We constantly make new designs and could offer unique products exclusively for dropshipping and possibly just to individual sellers. This option would be possible if you are able to sell bigger amounts and are ready to establish long term relationship with us.

* We have our own factory, source the materials carefully and we have dozen full time employees right now making the toys. This means that we basically cannot run out of products, we do have a capacity which limits the speed we can make them but there is very little risk that we could not to be able to find the wood, fabric, thread and other materials needed for the toys.

* Every product is checked for the quality. This is already more just a tradition than actually a needed step as the craftsmen and women who work are proud of their work and don't want to make any sub-quality toys.

* That being said, we are not a sweatshop. We pay higher salaries than anyone we know here and there is many people asking to work for us. In case we need to increase our production capacity we have freelance contractors who work for us if they are needed and plenty of people who would like to work full time as well.

* Our products are rare, so much that there is none of them available on sites like ebay (as far as we know). It's likely you have never even heard about our brand name as we have done custom orders to big European and US based brands and have just recently started to properly establish our own brand and ship to importers. We do have re-sellers in several countries who carry our products but we can offer different, unique products for dropshipping.

* We are flexible, if you place an order for a product which we don't have in stock, we can probably make one the same day.


**Cons and things to note when ordering from us**

* Our location is remote to the major markets. We are based in Thailand and from our experience it takes up to 1-2 or even 3 weeks for order to reach the customer. It can come through in 5-6 days but we can not count on that. There is faster shipping methods but those are expensive.

* In case there is a constant need for quick shipping for certain products somewhere, let's say in the US, we could start using local storage and logistics service in there to fulfill the orders. This is possible but it will add costs and doesn't work with our current method of making products as they are needed and keeping just limited stock, we would need to manufacture larger stock of items that is shipped to the logistics company and limit the amount of different products shipped from there.

* We want to start small and work with only few sellers first. As our products are not mass manufactured and we cannot just open the gates to everyone at once or we could end up in situation where we cannot fulfill the orders in timely manner.

* We can ship blind, and customize the packages and receipts but we would need to find out what is needed and how much costs it would add to our end.

I'm about to start work on a new ecommerce site that is specifically selling Carpet. 
My Boss - who's been selling carpets retail for 35 years - says its impossible as buying carpet is a tactile ""touchy feely"" purchase.

To counteract this, I'm going to offer a free sample service - just 10x10cm size - with a maximum of 3 samples per customer.

Other ideas I have are to make the images of the carpet excellent quality and plentiful, so you can really see the 'pile' - maybe put something on the carpet for scale (no bananas!) or put something heavy on it to show how deeply it sinks into the pile?

ecommerce,Looking for advice on an e-commerce platform,"So I've been toying with the idea of opening an e-commerce store for a brand I'm trying to get off the ground. I have a very simple electronics line consisting of a few products, and I've heard that Shopify is probably the way to go.

So I signed up for it, and I'm in my 14 day trial, and I didn't realize that there would be an extra cost for Premium themes. There doesn't seem to be much to choose from, and the Free themes are pretty ""ordinary"".

I like the interface, but I was wondering if there are any big e-commerce websites you know that uses Shopify? I'm hoping to see if it's worth paying for Shopify, and then paying another $150+ for a decent theme rather than just going to Magento or Wordpress where there is a much bigger selection of themes.

Bonus would be an example of the use of free themes, but maybe customized for a particular store.

I have toyed around with Magento and Prestashop in the past.  Setting up everything seems easy enough.  My only concern is the payment gateway.  I would like to accept credit cards on my website, but I remember that setting up something like that was a pain.  I like that Shopify has all that integrated into it.  I'm not planning on scaling up to a large inventory anytime soon (less than 50 products), so I'm not sure I need something as powerful as Magento.  

If you do recommend an all-in-one solution like Shopify...which one would you go with?  A google search pops up several competitors that look just as good as Shopify (Volusion, BigCommerce, etc), and look like they have better incentives/pricing plans.",10,2,2014-06-06,ECOM,0.020225053653120995,0.914107084274292,0.06566782295703888
shopify,Thinking about using Shopify for an E-commerce idea. Can you show me examples of current websites that use shopify?,"So I've been toying with the idea of opening an e-commerce store for a brand I'm trying to promote.  I have a very simple electronics line consisting of a few products, and I've heard that Shopify is probably the way to go.

So I signed up for it, and I'm in my 14 day trial, and I didn't realize that there would be an extra cost for Premium themes.  There doesn't seem to be much to choose from, and the Free themes are pretty ""ordinary"". 

I like the interface, but I was wondering if there are any big e-commerce websites you know that uses Shopify?  I'm hoping to see if it's worth paying for Shopify, and then paying another $150+ for a decent theme rather than just going to Magento or Wordpress where there is a much bigger selection of themes.  

Bonus would be an example of the use of free themes, but maybe customized for a particular store.",8,1,2014-06-06,ECOM,0.018971119076013565,0.9236540794372559,0.05737483501434326

ecommerce,What are the most important jobs at a medium-sized ecommerce business?,"I'm working for a company that used to be a brick and mortar retailer. A few years ago, the physical location was closed and the business was shifted entirely to the internet. The website was created a couple years before the physical location closed, and since then has been updated occasionally but not significantly.

My title would probably be ""website administrator"", but I do everything from design, to development, to content population, email marketing, SEO optimization, AdWords management, and pretty much everything else on the website.

There's an owner/operator, and two other employees. The owner adds some content, updating product descriptions and prices from time to time, but for the most part hands them off to me to update. The majority of his time is spent answering sales calls and interfacing with suppliers and distributors.

Some of the products are drop-shipped, and some are shipped from a physical warehouse location that doesn't have any retail space and is used solely for warehousing and shipping of the products. One of the employees handles the majority of the shipping, he packs the orders each day and prepares them for shipment.

The other employee spends about half his time assisting with the shipping and the other half assisting with the phone calls, and he also handles some of the accounting.

So, out of the four people at the company, two of them handle phone sales when a visitor calls in instead of ordering from the website (one of whom is the owner), one of them handles the shipping and organization of the warehouse, and I am the only one responsible in any significant way for the website and web presence in general.

Is this typical for an ecommerce business? I would have thought the website would be the primary focus of the business, or at least of the owner. I've asked him to spend more time with me to come up with marketing ideas, usability improvements for the site, and other efforts that I think would help to grow the business. He always seems to be too busy answering the sales calls, which I guess is necessary since he's the only one with a comprehensive knowledge of the products.

I've suggested that he work to get some of the information he's dealing with on the phones into the website, so visitors can find the answers to their questions without having to call, and would be more likely to order online. I've also suggested that he hire a couple more employees to handle the phones so that he doesn't have to work essentially full time as a phone sales representative.

All of these suggestions have fallen upon deaf ears. The general sentiment seems to be that the website is a secondary part of the operations, and that the real thing keeping the business afloat is the phone sales and the shipping department. This is the first ecommerce business I've worked for, though I Have done a bit of web design, development, and marketing in the past. Maybe I'm looking at this solely from my own experience and I'm missing something, but it seems strange to me that the primary focus of an ecommerce business isn't it's website.

Has anyone else had experience with a situation like this? Am I missing something? If I were the owner, I'd be spending the majority of my time putting as much information as possible onto the site (by giving it to the web administrator to be entered) to decrease the number of phone calls and the time spent on each call selling a customer. I would assume that the primary goal would be to increase visits, and to increase the number of unassisted orders from the website.",2,3,2014-06-08,ECOM,0.1356571763753891,0.8426567912101746,0.021686038002371788

So thanks to reading a post on reddit a few years back, I started a drop-shipping business that supplies the UK public with eco-friendly coffins (slightly strange yes..)

Anyhow, I use adwords to bring traffic to my site, and have some ads that bring people to our wicker coffin selection, and some that bring people to our home page. 

When people hit our home page, they seem to leave without doing anything. I'm pretty sure I'm getting the right traffic, so people clearly don't like what they see. I thought I was doing everything right - call to action, clear idea of what we do - but clearly not.

If anyone has an idea of anything I could improve, I'd appreciate it SO MUCH!

ecommerce,"Severely limited with Volusion, considering switching. Need recommendations.","I work for a small company (about a dozen employees) and am responsible for most of maintaining our web store. We currently use Volusion because the guy who worked here before me was already familiar with it, but it's proven to be very limiting. We're considering making the switch to another provider, but I don't know much about what's on the market right now and could use some advice.

I'll give some of the specific limitations we're encountering, to help you guys make suggestions that will overcome these limitations.

First - we sell some products that have multiple components that customer can choose from. Not all combinations are compatible (in fact most are not!) and Volusion has no way to change what options are available for one selector based on the contents of a previous selector. Because of the workaround we have to use, we cannot track the stock quantities of each child component or prevent customers from buying certain incompatible combinations or out of stock child components.

Second, we sell to both retail and wholesale customers. While we can set different *product* prices for each, we cannot set different *option* prices for each unless we wanted to list EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT (with options) twice, have two variants of every option with a price differential, and hide the wholesale versions from retail customers. This would also mean our wholesale customers have to see both retail and wholesale versions of the same product, instead of simply getting the wholesale prices on the same page that retail customers set the retail prices. Right now, wholesalers can either pay the full retail price for add-ons and options, or they must place their orders over the phone with us instead of using the webstore.

We have a lot of products for sale - roughly 200, though that includes variations of size, color, etc on some. If at all possible, we would like to avoid having to manually re-enter all product prices, descriptions, photos, etc etc for every single product when we switch. Volusion does support exporting a lot of information, but that's only helpful if the new provider can import them from the CSVs or whatever. Even a partial import could save many man-hours of work - and since the only two people who work on the web store are me and our head of R&amp;D, saving man-hours is important to us!

woocommerce,Working With Suppliers Worldwide,"Hi,

After doing some research, I decided I'd be best asking the experts on Reddit regarding the best setup to proceed for in my online store.

I currently hold no stock, and work with suppliers across the globe, they are all independent of each other, so each supplier has a specific set of products, and they all have different shipping prices to different locations.

What is the best setup to use? Produce Vendors + Per Product Shipping combination, or Table Rate Shipping V2.

Let me know if there is a better alternative, and if I haven't explained it well enough, let me know.

ecommerce,Pricing strategies,"One of my 3 SKUs is low on stock on Amazon right now and its getting closer if the new stock will arrive before I go out of stock so I've been experimenting with pricing strategies, in particular, decoy pricing.

I want people to order SKU 2 or 3 rather than SKU 1.

* SKU 1 - £5.99
* SKU 2 - £6.99
* SKU 3 - £7.99

Each SKU is a variation of the product and as you go from 1 to 2 then to 3 the product could be seen as 'better' (this depends on personal situation). At this price point they were all selling quite evenly until last week where SKU 1 took off and is now running low.

I've changed my prices to:

* SKU 1 - £6.99
* SKU 2 - £7.49
* SKU 3 - £8.99

Would you chose SKU 2 over SKU 1 in this situation? Would it put you off at all?

In the hope that people will look at the options and decide that SKU 3 is too expensive (we've had far more faults on this product than any other) and then decided that for the extra 50p SKU 2 is the better option.",4,4,2014-06-16,ECOM,0.027789629995822906,0.8670220971107483,0.10518823564052582

Well I'm fishing for some specific information, but I hope to engage the community and learn more about all the options out there for designers/devs/architects/managers etc.

In case anybody has addtl insight on my specific issues, what I'm struggling w/ in BigCommerce is:

- Limited swatch/rollover functionality in category view:  Just like most online apparel retailers (ie. urbanoutfitters.com), product color swatches can be seen from a category level view and clicked or rolledover to swap the corresponding image.  Similarly, in product view, swatches that change the corresponding image selection for magnify/zoom view, have been almost impossible to implement into BigCommerce.

- Issuing Partial Refunds: If a customer buys two items, and wants only to return/exchange one item, it must be done 100% manually, meaning calculating tax and adjusting inventory, instead of a more intuitive 'select item to be returned,' type of button.

- Accepting split tender:  If a customer wants to pay with a Visa giftcard, for example, and the remainder of balance with a credit car, this is also not possible with BigCommerce.

Anyone got a recommendation of a platform who can handle these seemingly basic type of functions?",4,6,2014-06-17,ECOM,0.02970670349895954,0.9358094334602356,0.03448386862874031

I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this before?

A few things that may play a role in this:

* Using Paypal to process so users are taken offsite then redirected after purchasing, perhaps the customer exited before redirect?
* I do have it set to redirect with a no override so purchases show original referring source rather than Paypal.
* Running on WooCommerce.

My company is a digital marketing agency who has now begun down the road of building some eCommerce value add software apps and have decided to initially focus on Shopify as our platform partner of choice.

I'm trying to connect with other Shopify app partners to see if there are any items to be aware of when it comes to how they work with partner developers. We have an account rep there, but their interaction with us has been quite wishy-washy to put it mildy. Very nice people, but also very difficult to get clear answers from. The closer we're getting to launch the more specific our questions, and it seems their answers are getting more vague.

Hoping someone here might have a few words of advice, in particular around dos and don'ts of working with Shopify.

I have finally nailed down a niche that I want to use for an ecommerce site however the only thing stopping me is that my desired domain name is taken.

Urbangenltman, shit happens, pick another!

Can't.  Nothing says my site better than this one. It is literally a foreign word that translates into what my site is about, leave nothing to the imagination and I am stubborn.

The site wants $3750 for the rights of the domain, fair price looking down the road. 

I cannot afford that right now and was curious to know if it's legal (not necessarily ethical) to host a crowd sourcing campaign to help me acquire the domain name along with getting it designed, set up and launched.

ecommerce,Top Apps or Software that I use for Ecommerce,"I thought it may be interesting to see what software or apps some of us use in Ecommerce.  My company does some decent volume and do most of our selling through online marketplaces like Ebay and Amazon.  Here are some of the apps I use:

Shipworks (15-50 per month for each marketplace)-  This was the first software I started using as we did 50 orders a day on Ebay.  It hooks up to all our marketplaces and all of our orders are downloaded into it once a day.  It combines all of our orders from over 6 marketplaces.  As orders our printed, the tracking and shipment details are reported back to the marketplaces.  It is similar to Shipstation but WAY more customizable.  We write custom filters for invoices, assign rules to send emails, and a bunch of other cool stuff.  Most likely our most time saving software.

SkuVault (150-300 per month for 3 users)-  I have been using this app for about 10 months now.  It tracks our inventory and creates a pick list by location and SKU.  It prints packing slips and allows our items to be scanned out of inventory as our order is packed.  It also allows us to run reports and track sales of our items.  All of our inventory flows through this app and it also integrates with Shipworks.

Terapeak (15 if annually, 30 if monthly)-  We use this to do research on Ebay products.  I usually start by searching a competitor and looking at their best items.  I then get a quote on that item from China, reverse the math and see if we can sell the item for a decent profit.  This is one of my main ways of sourcing items from China

Merchantwords (30 per month) -  This app is simple.  You type a popular keyword in and it gives you the estimated searches for that item on Amazon over a month.  We user this to run Amazon Ads and determine what keywords to use in our listings.

Ecommhub (25-150 per month) - We use this software to link our items from our vendor via FTP to our Amazon store.  Our drop shipper offers 10K items and we load those SKU in Ecommhub.  When an order on Amazon is placed, Ecommhub pushed the order to our drop shipper.  Once our drop shipper processes and ships the order, the information is sent to Ecommhub and then uploaded to Amazon.  This allows us to drop ship with complete automation.

These are the apps I use for my business and I am very happy with all of them.  I am currently looking to start using ChannelAdvisor and I thought some of you guys may have some good recommendations for apps you have used for your Ecomm business.",8,6,2014-06-26,ECOM,0.045810047537088394,0.9274567365646362,0.02673320285975933

ecommerce,Some help with setting up Multi Vendor CS-Cart,"Morning,

I have a friend who wants to set up an online store using the CS-Cart Multi-Vendor software.

I have been involved in an IT course the last 18 months so my knowledge on these topics is okay but in no means great.

I have read through the installation process and it all looks very straight forward and I have just a few questions that I am hoping to get answered here.


* First of all I am thinking of just running the server on a personal computer running on Windows as I am unfamiliar with OS like Linux, should I take the time to get to know Red-Hat Linux or will a Windows Server OS suffice?


* I have had no prior experience with Structured Query Language, how important is this to the installation and maintenance of the software? 
The installation guide does not say a whole lot about SQL but does mention some jargon I don't fully understand.

* Lastly, what other things must I be able to do to set up and maintain this software?
Any personal experiences, resources, or tips you got for me? 

Thanks for any responses, also which other subreddits could help me out with CS-Cart?",5,2,2014-06-26,ECOM,0.02439209446310997,0.9249927997589111,0.0506150908768177

ecommerce,Would you pay more for clothes made in the USA or Canada than you would for overseas production? All options on the table for me for new e-commerce clothing line. Guidance please?,"I am in the preproduction phase of a new luxury basics clothing line  using the Warby Parker model as inspiration. We are almost finished with fit testing, aside from a few tweaks to really nail it and then it's decision time. I have the opportunity to pair with a known manufacturer in India that my partners work with frequently, or I have the option to produce in Montreal (major fashion centre in Canada), which has lost a lot of work overseas during the past few decades, but still has a solid infrastructure for clothing production. I like the idea of manufacturing in Montreal as my wife grew up in the clothing business in Montreal, and her father is still in the clothing business there, which was my inspiration to be in the business in the first place.

Ultimately I'm wondering if people are actually willing to pay more for clothing made in the US or Canada? As an American, would it matter to you if a product was made in Canada? Would this be a value-add  and motivate you as a consumer? 

Also, the idea grabbed me last night about having inventory produced in both markets and giving people the choice to spend $25 for the Overseas and $29 for a made in Canada piece and letting the free market have the final word. twice the initial inventory costs, but seems like a new idea to me. Anyone else heard of a business doing this? Very curious about this.

ecommerce,Would like to sell framed pictures... Need some help!,"Hi everybody,

I've been thinking for a while about starting an online business, but I didn't have any good idea. I finally found something, but I have a hard time finding the products I want to sell.
Basically, I would want to sell framed pictures or framed art, but I wouldn't make it myself. What I had in mind is to have a collection of pictures/art on my website and people could choose the size/frame they want.
The thing is, I wouldn't take the pictures myself or make the art. I want to use other people's stuff (since I suck at art and I'm not a good enough photographer).
So he only problem I see, after looking for some dropshipper, is how do I get the rights to some pictures? Should I buy the pictures myself and try to sell them (like on ShutterStock) or do I ask individuals? I'm mostly concerned about copyrights, I wouldn't want problems in the future.
