ecommerce,Need advice. I need a code or plugin to enable my customers to register their purchased product on my website.,"So basically the idea is to validate the product authenticity and also be able to communicate with my customers better. Is there an easier way to do that besides hiring a coder to code everything?

So lets say they buy the product online or from other retail outlets of our product. They are given product number and a pin number. They will use that to go on my site to register the product.

ecommerce,input on checkout verbiage,"hello friends. trying to write some verbiage for the checkout system on one of my sites. Is this clear enough, or is it kludgey and confusing. Please feel free to comment or improve. very much appreciated:
(whatever).com now uses Paypal exclusively for all orders.
As we sell unique art items, and it would create a problem if two customers ordered the same item at the same time, the items in your cart have now been locked so that no one else can buy them while you are completing your transaction at Paypal.
&lt;bold red=""""&gt;You have 15 minutes to complete your checkout with Paypal.&lt;/bold&gt;red&gt;
If you do not complete your checkout on Paypal within 15 minutes, the items in your cart will be available for other customers to buy. If someone else completes an order for an unique item that is in your cart, that item will be removed from your cart and you will notified.

ecommerce,Looking for a good third-party site to compile real  customer ratings and reviews,"Has anyone found a decent solution to accumulating customer ratings for Google Products/Adsense?

All the third party sites I've researched either (a) assault my customers with sweepstakes and shopping bullshit, or (b) require registration including the customer's email address.

I think both options suck.  I'm hoping there's some solution (paid is fine) that isn't super cheesy and doesn't require registration to submit a review.

Anybody found one?",2,5,2011-08-23,ECOM,0.03915703296661377,0.9260011911392212,0.03484174236655235
