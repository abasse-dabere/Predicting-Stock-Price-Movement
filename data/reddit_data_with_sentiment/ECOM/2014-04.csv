Has anyone heard of these things? He stated that the Hummingbird update is the lates update that google made. He said that in order to rank well, websites need to be compatible with the update and also have an Externally Hosted XML Sitemap.

ecommerce,Which e-commerce platform is currently working best for you?,"Hello r/ecommerce! I have been tasked with building an online store for my employer. He currently has a free Weebly store, however, I have played around with this and it doesn't seem like the best option.

Ideally I'm looking for a platform that is SEO friendly and that allows us to build a blog at the same time.

I was thinking of WooCommerce, though from what I have read this seems to be extremely expensive. I do like the look of Magento and Cart66 but I have no experience with these (Though I can learn).

So I suppose my question is what do you guys think is the best ecommerce platform for a small but growing business. Should I just upgrade the Weebly account or should I host my own WordPress/Magento/Cart66 store? Any help you guys can give me would be great as there seems to be sooooo many options. Thank you.

ecommerce,How the Internet of Things (IoT) can Improve Ecommerce Experience,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the inter-connection, inventory and management of all internet-connected devices, uniquely identified through tools like RFID, QR codes and digital watermarking. IoT has grown drastically in the last couple of years, but according to experts this will pale in comparison to what lies ahead. We’re already seeing devices of all kinds being connected to the internet to share information and keep the right people updated.
 
By using IoT enabled devices and tools, you can tag and track all your products, but there’s more to it than that, so let’s have a look at some ways you can really use this technology to your advantage:
 
• Inventory Management: In the present day scenario, inventories are tracked by the use of ERP systems which are capable of reconciling the stock in the warehouse with the ones sold and then send notifications to vendors to replenish the stock. With IoT you can manage your inventories real-time. Equipped with RFID tags and sensors the information about your incoming and outgoing stocks can be tracked without human intervention. Also, the information such as the product type, manufacturer’s name, batch IDs of products, expiry date if any can be automatically fed into your ERP system real-time.
The same can also be fed into your ecommerce store so that your time to market is reduced to the best possible level. You can convert thisinto a customer friendly action by notifying your customers whenever you have new stock coming in.There are always those who might have been unable to place an order becauseyour stock countdownwas nearing zero.Knowing that they can now get what they want, you are increasing chances of revenue increase.
 
• Logistics Management and Delivery Tracking: Real-time tracking has been possible for a long time. With the use of IoT enabled detectors, this process can have the added capability of managing things like the route and speed that your logistics crew areallowed to handle. While this is possible to a certain extent today, paired with IoT these capabilities can be extended to any new technology coming in, like the concept of unmanned delivery drones by Amazon. Let’s take that as an example because this is an exciting blend of sci-fi and reality: You get your personal drone squadron and they deliver to your customers. If one of them develops a fault, you would expect it to land ASAP. IoT enables you to add such rules and monitor them remotely without much hassle.
While you want to get the nitty-gritties on your logistics, your customer only has one question, “When exactly will my order be delivered?” With IoT, you can make it happen. This is going to make customers get a much better shopping experience and increases brand loyalty.
 
• Personalization: Personalization is definitely more important than ever before. With IoT you can do two things for personalizing the customer experience – customized offers and customized delivery times. Your customer’s feedback time is going to be near instantaneous, and you can leverage this to immediately relay customized offers to them. IoT offers greater automation of the delivery process and as such simplifies the management of logistics, which in turn streamlines customized delivery management.
 
• After-sales Services: Tracking the various warranty periods on all the different products is laborious. With IoT updating the information (purchase date and warranty period), youshould be able to setup system notifications and automate the sending of warranty extension offers.This will work great even for tracking the validity and duration of any Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) you have with customers.
By notifying your customers to such events, you’ll be increasing customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and increasing revenues through after sales services.
 
The IoT is already creating an environment that will benefit everyone in becoming more efficient. As an ecommerce vendor in an industry where that is paramount, accommodating and planning for IoTwill soon become a mandate

dropship,Newbie questions about niche and suppliers.,"I've just started researching dropshipping and I want to make sure I do my due diligence before taking the plunge, so I've basically been reading everything I can get my hands on (including as many pages of this subreddit as my browser would load).  

Along those lines, I have a couple of questions I haven't been able to find an answer to.

1) If the product you are thinking of dropshipping is sold by a big-box retailer, is that an automatic disqualification?  If, for instance, the front page of Google for your proposed niche has Target, Costco, or Walmart is the top three or four searches, but then smaller independent sites after that, is there still room for you?  Obviously that depends on what the other independent sites are doing, but do you automatically throw away a niche product if it's sold by big box retailers as a general rule of thumb?

2)  How many dropshippers use multiple suppliers?  In terms of time vs. reward, is it easier/preferable to stick to a niche that can be dropshipped from a single, streamlined source, or do many dropshippers prefer niches with mutltiple suppliers in case of stockouts or as a hedge against supplier bankruptcies or other unanticipated downturns?",7,6,2014-04-07,ECOM,0.10701791197061539,0.8711693286895752,0.021812718361616135

woocommerce,[HELP] Problem with Product Variations!,"Hi,

I have been struggling to find help with the issue, if this is the wrong place to be posting this, I would appreciate it if you would direct me in the right direction. 

I run a website called Image to Painting and have been slowly creating an e-commerce website (which is currently available at 173.254.28.117/~imagetop/). I sell a service which allows users to upload photos / images which are then painted by our professional painters and then posted to their house. However, in each product we have two different types of variations: 'Amount of subjects' (How many people / animals, etc are in the painting) and Frame Type.

The problem I am having is that I want to add the prices in the form of Painting + Subject = Total. However, at the moment the price is only being shown as £XX-XX.

Is there a way to change this or am I just being silly?

Regards,

dropship,"T-shirts and bumper stickers, AKA high profit and low cost products - good idea or too saturated?","I wanted to start moving from the office into working in web sales / marketing / etc. I wanted to try with something simple. I have about $500 to put toward an online business. I have SEO and web design experience, being a web programmer by career.

I wanted to make bumper stickers and T-shirts. I know there are a lot of these kinds of sites, but my thoughts were:

1. I have a lot of trouble finding t-shirts and stickers that I actually like. I want to make the kind of products that I want to buy.
2. It is really expensive to get these items custom made using the standard websites like cafepress/zazzle and they are not of the quality I wanted.

I have a specific niche I'm targeting, and I know how I want to do my website, SEO, and advertising. What I'm not sure, however, is how to actually get my product. How do you go about finding someone who can make your t-shirts / stickers the way you want them, so you can sell them? I've been doing a lot of reading and most people just say ""I have a connection to a manufacturer"" or ""I found a website to supply me"" but they never actually explain how or where they find these things.

Redid my site and put $15 on a fb add for the last 20 minutes of Saturday 4/12. Huge surge on my site and this is what I got: http://i.imgur.com/oVmAGDb.png

I am well aware I shouldn't throw money at Facebook ads, however I just wanted to get some numbers to see how I could possibly do once I start getting organic traffic.

I should mention that during checkout, the user is informed that shipping is 14-21 days. I think people get turned off by this. This can also be found in my FAQ page.

I am dropshipping right now and waiting for samples to arrive next week. Once I validate the samples I am going to order bulk and ship 3-5 day USPS shipping, so I imagine my conversion rate will be higher.

Just looking for some insight from others who have experience in ecommerce as this is my first go.

In about 2005 he briefly had a terrible website which sent credit card info, plain text, to his email account, along with the person's description of what they wanted.. needless to say this didn't last long before we agreed it was far too sketchy and we just stopped. He would just enter the cc info into the visa terminal he has at his shop.

What way does it work now in the real 100% not sketchy world of ecommerce? Will he have to use paypal, or some other service to accept payments? Also what kind of % do these companies take. I'd prefer if there was no monthly fee and or big one off fee.

I was wondering about the permalinks. I want to prepend all pages that are related to the ""shop"" to have that before any url WooCommerce makes.

Effectively:

- http://example.com/shop (this is the shop)
- http://example.com/shop/product-cat (this is the product category)
- http://example.com/shop/product-cat/item (this is the item of sale)

Which is easy setting up at the permalink settings, but:

- http://example.com/shop/checkout (this is the checkout)
- http://example.com/shop/cart (this is the shopping cart/basket)
- http://example.com/shop/account (this is the user account)

These pages are returning a 404 error when I make them children of the ""shop"" page in the pages section of Wordpress.

If I recall correctly you were able to prepend all links with ""/shop/"" once, but with the new updates I cannot find it.

I have an ecommerce store that is starting to pick up. Currently I am dropshipping 3 specific items, and I am currently working with the same supplier on a bulk order in the coming 2 weeks so I can start offering faster shipping times and so I can QC everything.

I am having trouble on deciding what my order should be though. I have sales, but not enough to prove what is more popular since it is pretty spread out.

I have 3 items, each have 6 colors and then for each color 4 sizes. Are there any proven methods for starting out with inventory management? I have researched ""Average size of ____"" to see what the market holds, but maybe I should get the same of everything to start?

Thanks for any input.

dropship,"A few general drop shipping questions (licenses, fees etc)","Hello everyone,

Been lurking here for about a month now and have gotten some good info. There are a couple of questions that I have not been able to answer myself either through this sub or my own research online (my google-fu may be weak, who knows) 

Anyways, I've been looking into getting into drop shipping. I was thinking of starting out with eBay and/or Amazon and work up to starting my own site at some point after I get my feet wet. I've looked at various wholesale directories and I think I've settled on Salehoo. Seems to be a well put together site with a lot of support and instruction (something I need)  My question is, has anyone else had any luck/experience with these guys? I've read good reviews online but was looking for some more information. Also, in regards to the wholesalers they have, what can I expect to pay as a set up fee to them (ballpark, not expecting exact numbers) I've seen it referred to as a ""small set up fee"" but nothing more.

My second issue that I've been unable to resolve on my own is the issue of permits. I'm in California, and I get the impression that all I may need to get started is a resellers permit an a tax ID (which I can use my own social for as a sole proprietor). Can anyone corroborate that? Obviously once I start getting into my own website and stuff like that I'll need a DBA and Business license, but for eBay/Amazon I can't really tell what I need.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",3,4,2014-04-23,ECOM,0.023304887115955353,0.9332754015922546,0.04341974854469299

Have been dropshipping a very niche set of 3 products for a month now, and have validated interest. Most buyers bail on checkout when they find out shipping is 3+ weeks so it is time to stock up! 

Starting small (200 units total) so let's see what happens! 

Any input on inventory management will be greatly accepted. I plan for things to be very slow for the next 5 months or so as all of my sales are from gorilla marketing and small adword campaigns. My conversion rate on checkout is about 1% with long shipping but can be much higher as 8% of people add to cart and reach check out. 

Once I start ranking higher in Google I am hoping for things to pick up... if not then I can sell in bulk on ebay at a small loss and take my lessons learned to the next project!",0,1,2014-04-23,ECOM,0.02900674380362034,0.9136199355125427,0.05737332999706268

ecommerce,"After the Noah Kagan AMA, I decided to do a 48 hour eCommerce challenge. Just launched a subscription box service that I would love to have reviewed.","TLDR: http://condomusmaximus.com

Lots of work for a first timer, so appreciate all feedback. I am still missing quite a bit of copy, but I plan on finalizing it by the end of the week. Since yesterday I have 14 new customers, mostly friends and acquaintances and with my original budget of $50 to launch, I have already made a profit this month.

The Noah Kagan AMA really inspired me to just do it, avoid over thinking it. I came up with the idea on Friday, found the domain sometime over the week and eventually got to work on Sunday night, in total actual hours of work I spent around 12 hours over a 72 hour period. I know there are others doing the same thing and similar pricing, so my first question is what is my USP and that's a variety of condoms in every shipment and frequency options.

Please give me the critique of a life time, I am sticking with Wootique and Woocommerce with Stripe until I need to change it. I am also working on updating the website with better CSS, but I will need to learn more about CSS over the weekend when I have downtime.

Thanks for the look.

I'm afraid switching to an ecommerce provider will make the website look boxy and product driven, when it'd be nice to have a ""store"" section, then a ""blog"" section which I can dress up with as many pictures and tables and descriptions of things as I'd like.

Would having my prices converted into Euros at the PayPal gateway kill my conversion rate?

ecommerce,Gaining social media traction?,"I'm at wits end. I had previously managed a company's Facebook and Twitter account with 5,000+ followers/likes, and it was no problem growing numbers organically.

I'm now at a startup, managing our social media accounts. I started from scratch and for the past few months have a measly 150ish followers for each channel.

With the changes to Facebook's news feed algorithms, we decided to shift our focus to Twitter and have tried our hardest to build traction there. Nothing we've tried has worked. I've read countless books on social media marketing, and employed almost everything in the book. I spend about 2-3 hours a day engaging users, posting tweets, links, retweeting, favoriting.

Today, we've tried to gain traction via giveaway, hoping it'd be our golden ticket. We've started to plateau at around 16 retweets since the tweet was posted this morning.

I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle. I want to get more traction on social media so we can generate more traffic to our website, but neither is happening.

Any help? How do I reach people from ground zero?",6,2,2014-04-28,ECOM,0.025736797600984573,0.9195156693458557,0.05474752187728882

ecommerce,Where to hire a good eCommerce consultant?,"I'm hoping to hire a consultant to review our eCommerce business (the website, as well as our presence on social media, amazon, ebay etc), and set us up with a ""plan for success(?)"".

We have an ecommerce site that's been operating for about 8 years. It did quite well until late 2012, when I believe Google's Penguin / EMD update caused us to drop off the SERPs for most of our top keywords.

I need someone experienced, knowledgeable, and qualified, to take an overall look at our business, identify the problems, and come up with a plan for us to correct the problems and grow our business going forward.

I'm not sure if ""consultant"" is the right word for this. I'm not looking for someone to ""do stuff"" for us, but rather to give us a detailed plan for what we need to be doing, what we need to fix, and how to do it.

Does such a thing exist? Is a consultant even what I should be looking for? I've tried hiring ""SEOs"" before, and none of them have delivered.",11,3,2014-04-29,ECOM,0.025233471766114235,0.900452733039856,0.07431378215551376

ecommerce,Content focused Ecommerce Store,"Hey guys,

Looking to create a blog/content centred site with ecommerce capabilities— think a mix between, reddit, fancy.com and yummly.com.

I can take different routes to get there, but wanted some feedback from the wise folks at r/ecommerce.

Option 1    
Integrate Wordpress and shopify using the shopify widget app. Cheap but may create some confusion for users.     
   
Option 2  
Custom Shopify theme.  Expensive, but creates a clean and unified site.
    
Option 3    
Woocommerce - get a custom theme created rather than going the custom shopify route.

My gut tells me to stick with worpress as it has many more tools for content based sites and either go with woo commerce or hire a dev to link the sites design

ecommerce,Free tools for your website - are they aggregating data? What’s the catch?,"Maybe I’m just a paranoid non-programmer, but I feel like these tools are up to something.

There are a number of tools that are put out there by developers. They’re typically free and are somewhat beneficial, depending on what you do. For the sake of not giving free advertising to these companies, here are a few examples of what I’m talking about:

“Sign up, embed this code on your website and a popup will collect emails”
“Put this code on your homepage to have an attention grabbing bar at the top of your page”
“Upload this script and create a free account and we’ll tell you where people are clicking”

If I do any of these things, will the creator of these scripts have access to data like web traffic, time on site, bounce rates, demographics or anything like that? What are they getting in exchange for giving me free scripts?

Now, obviously there are a lot of services out there that charge a lot of money for great applications. But I’ve always heard that if I’m not paying for the product, I am the product.
