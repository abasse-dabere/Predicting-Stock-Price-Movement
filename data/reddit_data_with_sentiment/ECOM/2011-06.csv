ecommerce,HUGE hole in most ecommerce platforms,"So, the store I work at was randomly audited for out-of-state sales tax. No biggie, but I was asking them some questions about internet sales (since we're going to start doing that pretty soon here). Anyways, the agent told me that for in-state sales tax we have to add sales tax for the COUNTY the product is going to. 

So, I'm not sure how other ecommerce platforms are setup, but most go by zip code. Which is entirely wrong since two different counties with different tax rates can have the same zip code. Problem? Yes. If you entered a tax rate at a specific zip code you could possibly over or under charging your customer. 

Anyone here found a way around this? Or do you use a ecommerce platform that allows you to do this?

I realize this is very rare, but I find that this is important information and is hard to(or at least scarce) find online.",0,1,2011-06-22,ECOM,0.09551604092121124,0.8799925446510315,0.02449144795536995
