dropship,"[ URGENT ] My google ads were DOING great, until...","Hey Reddit, 

I recently discovered google ads, with no prior experience whatsoever, I tried them out, and in the first 5 minutes of them being displayed, I made 4 consecutive sales, making in total 300$ in revenue in less than 72 hours ( My ads were paused, I was changing budget, etc ... )

It was going really great, until I discovered that my conversion track was at 0% ( It was miss placed or something ), and when I finally got to fix it, it was too late : Google has stopped displaying my ad, because of the poor conversion rate ( 0%, officially ), even though I had technically a very high conversion rate.

At that moment, I panicked, I put a bid of 500$ ( It was originally 11$, then 50$, then 70$ ) and thought that everything would be like before, but I was wrong.

I then deleted my campaign, and made an identical one ( same targeting, etc, and 500$ budget ), but got only 12 impressions in 24 hours, and you guessed it... 0 clicks.

I then created a brand NEW Google Ads account, but this time, put 1000$ in budget, and after being reviewed, still, 0 impressions &amp; 0 clicks.

I drastically decreased my budget to 50$, but same thing.

How can I fix this horrible mistake, knowing that if my conversion were tracking properly from the start, I would have already beat my biggest competitor :( I feel really demotivated right now, because it was such a STUPID mistake from me, and I could have done a lot by now...",5,9,2019-04-01,ECOM,0.07130759209394455,0.8694561123847961,0.059236351400613785

dropship,How is there enough profit if only marking up items by like $10-15$?,"I'm trying to figure out dropshipping currently I broker auto parts which is kinda the same just online right? 

When I tell customers a price for a part on a tailgate for example Ill tell a customer $750 and then talk down the company I get it from to $500. 

  From what I seen online was a person only adding like 10-15$ extra from the supplier they get there inventory from. Granted they might be getting slightly better deal but how is that profitable?  

Only thing I can see is if you have tons and tons of customers but then it just makes dropshipping seem impossible because you'd need so many customers to really make lot of money.

ecommerce,What's your e-commerce solution recommendation for international multi-store? What would be the reasons against WooCommerce?,"Hello,

I need to find a new e-commerce solution for my company and I am struggling on what to choose.

I have a demand for some enterprise features (multi store/warehouse/international website) but not the amount of SKU.

I  need a solution that can handle multi-store (different  countries/websites/languages/domains but same products); that seems to eliminate  almost all solutions. The goal would be to have a long-term solution and not to be forced to  change in 2 years because we are limited by it. I don't have 100s of products and never will have.

The big guys in the industry seem to be Magento and Shopify Plus but they seem to both have considerable drawbacks.

My  understanding is that Magento is super powerful but I won't be able to create and manage everything by myself (I know PHP but never used Magento 1 or 2) and would need an expensive team to set up and make any changes.

Shopify Plus seems more reachable but  less customization is possible. I have the advantage of never really breaking the website but what if I need something outside of scope? I am also more locked-in; I know that they removed Mailchimp recently and that could be a problem).

I  have experience with both WooCommerce and WordPress multisite and was  wondering what would be the reasons against using it. I know how it works (I developed for it) and can customize it however I want (I could go with a Roots  set up to have a solid base). My understanding was that the scalability (if we ever reach 100 orders /  minute) would depend way more on the server than WooCommerce. Is it  wrong? Woocommerce would be fed the products, images, translations and data through the API.

I am looking for reasons against using WooCommerce but can't find a very convincing one so far. What do you think? Is there another solution that I overlooked?

* Developing my own seems more risky and time-consuming.
* Using a static website with Foxy or SnipCart could be too limited functionality-wise.

dropship,Testing products... which guru do I trust?,"Hi all. I’ve been a lurker on here for a while and have been trying my hand at this drop-shipping thing. 

First, I have a store and have been getting sales here and there but nothing consistently yet. So that brings me to the question: who do you trust most for testing products?

I have been using Frank Hatchetts method of going straight for conversions (ATC) and running the product for a few days. If I get an ATC I leave it for a few more. If nothing else happens I cut the ad and move on to a new product. I guess I have tested 30 products and all ended up being cut. I think I might need to try a new method. 

Recently I was following Gabriel St. Germain on YouTube and his idea of one product stores and testing the crap out of the creative, audience etc. 

Which method is the better one? Am I right to try and find a new method? Or maybe I haven’t given Franks method a chance.

dropship,Dropshippers: with trouble to find suppliers from China?,"Hello Dropshippers,

&amp;#x200B;

This is Lin from Shenzhen China.

I’ve been working in International business for a decade in two different companies (the frist 4-year was CCTV products and the last 6-year was Chemical Products), however not in retail. 

After back to China from India at the end of last year, I’m trying to figure out what’s next. For me, I started to feel little bit tired of sales job and tried to find some new ways out.

Last week I asked people here for suggestion about drop shipping and some of them gave me a real good idea, to be a middle man for those dropshippers that out of China but need to buy from China.

I took a while and thought I really could do such kind of work, in fact I’m just the right one to do it for people who need this kind of service. 

Firstly, I’m a good English speaker. Could understand you better than suppliers from 1688 or Taobao.

Secondly, I’m in Shenzhen China, not to mention that there’s thousands of factories in Shenzhen, even the factories in other cities, it’s still much convenient and cheaper to travel than you guys in other countries.

Thirdly, there’s uncountable shipping companies here in Shenzhen, it’s easy to find a reasonable price forwarder to do the logistic.

Last but not the least, I’m a Chinese and I live in China. I have experience in both selling and procurement. I know how to find the right products, and have no barriers to communicate with factories. I’m pretty familiar with 1688 and Taobao. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Below are the services that I could offer:**

1. Product Inspection

* Spot inspection for bulk orders (which may need travel to other cities)
* Ship to my address (Shenzhen) for small orders

2. Procurement

* Help to find the required products
* Or just contact the factories you’ve already found

3. Logistic

* Handling your goods in bulk like to FBA or your warehouse
* Or even drop ship directly from China

4. Translation 

* Chinese to English in writing
* Interpreter when you attend the Expo or visit factory in China (if needed)

That’s all I could think about now.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, if you have any other demand, we could discuss in details.

I’m open for any offer or suggestion, Just DM me if you are interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: I'm not sure about this kind of post could be posted here or not, if my post against the community's rules, please let me know and I will delete it.

dropship,Dropshipping online marketing &amp; strategy tips + info,"Hey guys, here are some dropshipping tips to help you out. I saw some things not posted yet that I use myself, so I'll post it in here:

&amp;#x200B;

\- First of all, you can learn how to use Google Ads by going through Google's free Google Ads courses. So all those drop shippers that are trying to sell you their Google Ads courses, they're all scammers. Just use the [Google Academy](https://academy.exceedlms.com/), which also contains Digital Transformation courses about online marketing and having an e-com store in general. Furthermore, I recommend getting to know Google Analytics (also a free Google Academy course), where you can use the e-commerce functions as well which are very useful for your dropshipping store.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Second, you can learn about funnels, and more about online sales, online marketing, etc. thanks to the [Hubspot Academy](https://academy.hubspot.com/). Also, look into the marketing tools from [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/).

&amp;#x200B;

\- Third, do your keyword research. Know what people want by using a tool like [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com). Besides CPC, it's also recommended to focus on SEO, on-page, and off-page. One on-page SEO tip is to write articles about your products with keywords in them that will rank your website up which is easily done with a WordPress + WooCommerce website. I'm not sure if that can be done with a Shopify store as well though.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The fourth thing that I want to bring to light is to not focus too much on Facebook ads or Instagram ads. They are more a tool to spread the word that you exist. Eventually, you will get most sales through inbound traffic, primarily through Google Shopping if you're selling something that Google shows in the shopping search results.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lastly, if everything goes well, don't go buy a fancy car, an apartment with beach view or a Rolex. Get off your lazy ass and put money in your business. Go to China and hustle with suppliers, buy in bulk, get a warehouse for storage and a lot faster shipping times.

&amp;#x200B;

All those YouTubers showing how rich they got by just sitting all day on their ass where they only need to click and type are all scammers, or they are missing lot's of revenue/profit by not putting energy in things that a smart man would do if you work on your business with your heart. So don't just work with pure profits in mind so you can flex on Instagram with designer /r/streetwear outfits, your fantastic holidays at the Bahamas and fancy cars instead of a business that is growing and growing. Yes, you can buy nice things for yourself and go to beautiful places. But don't forget to put effort into improving your company as well.

shopify,How To Set Up Facebook Messenger Chat On Your Shopify Store,"\*\*if you would like to see the instructions with pictures and videos you can check out my blog here  [https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-set-up-facebook-messenger-chat-on-your-shopify-store-a13e40186a75](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-set-up-facebook-messenger-chat-on-your-shopify-store-a13e40186a75)\*\*

A common question I am asked is can I just use my Facebook messenger chat on my store and the answer is… yes, you absolutely can and it is 100% free. Within the Shopify back-end it allows you to have the option of setting up a Facebook Messenger sales channel, which is good but not great. The reason I don’t find this option to be a great one is the user experience for visitors is not the best since it takes you away from the website when you click on it on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily there is a solution to this issue, what you need to do is install the Facebook Messenger plugin onto your store (from your Facebook page. Once the chat plugin is put on your store your visitors will be able to open the chat on the site and use it without being redirected. Keeping visitors on your site is very important, whenever you have an app on your store that takes a visitor away from your page you drastically increase the risk of having that user get distracted and not finish the purchase. Also keeping users on your site when using the chat function allows them to continue to browse and shop while they wait for your response.

1. Go to your stores Facebook page ( you must be an admin or owner on the page).
2. Go to your settings and click “messenger platform”.
3. Scroll down to the bottom and under “customer chat plugin” click set up.
4. Go through the setup wizard, you can change the greeting message and also the colors of the widget.
5. When you get to the end of the set up you will see this page, make sure to add your website to the domains list and then take that code and copy it.
6. Once you have the code copied go to your Shopify Backend, go to Online store, then click themes, then click the action button, and in the drop down select edit code. Find the theme.liquid template and paste the code you just copied right below the &lt;body&gt; tag and then click save.
7. Once you have done that go back to your Facebook page and click finish and that’s it. You will not have the Facebook chat app installed on your Shopify theme and it will function right on the page and will not take you anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

dropship,How I dropship products from Lowe's &amp; other retailers to eBay &amp; Make 6 figures/year Profit,"Hey everyone it's Sully back with another post! I've finally reached 2,000 subscribers on Youtube! And I wanted to finally make a video explaining exactly what eBay dropshipping is and how to do it correctly in 2019 because a lot of you messaged me and asked me to make this video!

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked about my eBay dropshipping business before on here and told you all about [My Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Vu-3ENX2gA6izLvRLXKIw), but I finally actually made a video explaining what eBay dropshipping is and how to do it successfully in 2019 using my method of Manual dropshipping.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you want to learn a little bit about what eBay dropshipping is and how you can get started then be sure to check out this new video! - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUxtqwUCRp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUxtqwUCRp4)

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially eBay dropshipping works like this:

1. Find a supplier (U.S. retailer)
2. List a product from their site to eBay for higher price
3. When it sells, go back to retailer's website and put eBay customer's shipping info...that's it! Retailer ships product to customer

&amp;#x200B;

eBay dropshipping is a lot simpler than Shopify dropshipping because:

1. You don't need to create any website
2. You don't need to do ANY advertising like FB ads or anything (eBay already has customers shopping on their site)
3. We use U.S. retailers like home depot, walmart, and my personal favorite Lowe'[s.com](https://s.com) to source our products from!

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest mistake, however, is people use all of these softwares in their eBay dropshipping business and get caught up in it and I really believe in 2019 and beyond my method of manual dropshipping (not using ANY software in your eBay dropshipping business) is the way to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

eBay dropshipping is what allowed me to dropout of college and work from home full time. I'm 21 years old at the moment and currently I have an eBay dropshipping business, Amazon dropshipping business, and an Amazon FBA business!

ecommerce,Best low cost / free replacement for Mailchimp after the Shopify breakup?,"I've got just under 2000 people on my mailing list, so I was able to send stuff out from Mailchimp for free still.  I'd love to switch over to Klayvio or one of the other high end systems, but I'd be quickly into the $200 a month range, and while if I really concentrated on dialing in my email marketing I'm sure I could make it worth while, but right now it's just not my focus in the business right now.  

Ideally I'd like to switch over to another company where I could bang out one email or two a month for free and of course still be integrated into my Shopify store.

ecommerce,Need Some Help With Marketing,"We have an online boutique which we started in August of last year, and to this point, traffic has unfortunately been abysmal. As in, under 5 visitors a day on most days. We have worked very hard to pick products that are quality and actually enjoyable to our customers, but so far, we haven't had much of an opportunity to showcase that quality because nobody knows about us.

Instagram is where we have been focusing most of our marketing efforts, but we feel like we're spinning our wheels. A lot of our followers are very low quality, as in they are just looking for a follow back or trying to sell us something. Also, we don't know what to post because obviously flooding people's feeds with product images doesn't motivate them to buy. We did experiment with sending samples to two fashion accounts on Instagram, and although they gave us very little boosts to our traffic, one did result in our first sale. Are we missing something when it comes to Instagram?

The advice that every guide and guru on the internet gives about marketing is to go with Facebook Ads or Google Adwords. We would definitely be willing to give either one of these a shot, but I'm having a very hard time finding any solid resources when it comes to getting started with them. Another concern is, again, what kind of content would our ads be? I'm assuming just posting product photos doesn't work very well, but I could be wrong. I'm just trying to think of it from the perspective of a Facebook or Google user. If I saw and ad for something, I probably wouldn't click it.

In general, we just feel kind of stuck when it comes to getting people to our site. Dealing with getting sales is one thing, but if nobody even visits our site, we have to solve that issue first. If anybody could point us in the right direction, we would be very appreciative.

ecommerce,Any fresh opinions on 2checkout as a payment gateway?,"I'm in a place currently underserved by payment processing giants such as Stripe, most of its larger competitors, and even Paypal is difficult to get up and running as they have an exclusivity deal with a single local bank. 

One alternative that was suggested to me, aside from small local actors, was a company called 2checkout. While I find some very positive reviews from years ago, I can't seem to find many opinions written in the last 12 months or so. That is, except an awful [0.8 rating on Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.2checkout.com). 

Even so, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Since 2checkout seems to be one of the few alternatives available in underserved markets, I can see it being popular in developing countries where payouts are complicated by everything from lack of proper documentation to banking infrastructure.

dropship,Stay away from Oberlo if you value your business reputation,"Turns out Oberlo are running a complete shitshow over there, awful support, awful practices.


I started my first dropship store after finding a successful product on Aliexpress, I then found a ""Verified"" supplier on Oberlo selling the same product, so naturally I opted for the Verified seller.

Big mistake.

I was prepared for the 3-4 week shipping times and I warned my customers of this beforehand.

What I wasn't prepared for, was for my customers to come back to me 3 weeks in telling me their tracking numbers are invalid.

Went back to the ""verified"" seller after the first instance;

https://i.imgur.com/1JA7f1n.png

Who as you can see took forever to get back to me, and didn't actually respond until 6 days later when I opened a dispute against them as advised by Oberlo's support team.

After a load of back and forth, we eventually had the order's replaced, and they issued me valid tracking numbers (The customers had already been waiting 2 weeks at this point, so their overall delivery time had gone from 3-4 weeks to 5-6 weeks.

Skip forward another 2 weeks to today, and I get a message from Oberlo saying the affected orders have been cancelled and to expect a refund in my account in the next week: https://i.imgur.com/Bd9qJB2.png


Now I have to refund those buyers who have been waiting nearly a month, I'm going to get a bunch of negative reviews and lose a load of business just because Oberlo are inept.

The best part? when I now attempt to contact their support team, they are ""busy"".

RIP to this business thanks to Oberlo, I wont make the mistake of dealing with them again.

Update: 

Oberlo's ""Support"" can't even grasp basic grammar, and have decided to include an order number that had nothing to do with the situation whatsoever:

I have a great product and am looking for drop shippers across the United States. I infused teas with CBD. They are 100% organic, THC free, and have been flying off our shelves at farmers markets. I am looking to expand my range and I think drop shippers are the next move. Our product, being CBD infused, have huge markups on them and we can sell them to you at wholesale prices. (markup \~50%) Let me know if this product is something you guys may be interested in. We have a warehouse and are about to expand, so we can produce as much as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other good sites to list ourselves as drop ship suppliers? We are on the lookout to get our product out anywhere and everywhere!

ecommerce,Is e-commerce a viable career?,"Hey guys, new to this sub and sorry I have to ask this. I’m hoping somebody can give me some examples of true e-commerce success from just your everyday person. Maybe even you guys. 

I LOVE e-commerce. I have been intrigued by selling things and making money online since high school.  Shortly after I graduated I had an up and running EBAY dropshipping store bringing in $600/month profit with pretty much no business costs but product. Sadly, that was the peak of my success thus far. I have since closed that shop to have more time to deal with some real life issues.

After the last few months of trying to decide what to do with my life, iv come to the conclusion that this is really the only thing I enjoyed doing and was decent at. I’m by no means a professional, but I would love to keep learning. 

My only issue is, there is SO much material out there on “how” to e-commerce. But I find VERY little on actual proven success stories or successful people. I have a hard time believing anybody that is trying to sell me a course or a product. Of course they made “a million dollars and you can too”. That’s not what I’m looking for. I’m looking for a real success. Someone just like me, that actually makes a living with this. Without being that prick. Just someone that can actually prove they sell and make a living. 

An example: Obviously the stock market isn’t an easy living either, right? But if I look for people that became successful in that market, the ratio makes it seem like I may have a better chance there. I find the successful e-commerce stories far and few. 

The next thing I want to do is create some Shopify stores and generate sales on either wholesale or drop shipped products. Can this in and of itself actually be successful?  And what kind of success? Extra money in your pocket success? Or living comfortably success? 

I just really find it hard to distinguish between what is actually possible and what is complete bullshit with everyone online. 

I understand it’s not an easy career path and that there’s a lot more to it. Taxes in themselves are still a nightmare to me. And I have much business to learn. But I just need to know is it really worth investing this time and effort? Is this really viable? 

I’m sorry my questions are so vague and that I’m rambling, I’m not quite sure what I’m looking for. Just some light at the end of the e-commerce tunnel I guess. Here’s some quick last minute questions:

1. What do you guys consider “success” at this? 
2. Are you guys happy with your e commerce life and the money you bring in? 
3. Should I be looking at this as a part time or full time venture? (Currently work 40 hours a week and do this) 

Sorry for the long one, thank you guys so much for reading.

dropship,Almost All Dropshipping Products Are Sourcing from China?,"Hi Guys,
I'm a newbie in dropshipping. I have done some rough studies. And then I find almost all products are sourcing from China. There're several tools can help people handling it. Do you guys care about the quality of your products delivering to the consumers? How do you check it?",17,5,2019-04-11,ECOM,0.16064096987247467,0.7965176105499268,0.042841412127017975
dropship,Testing an idea... hasn't gone well.,"First off I'm in the USA. I have a background in digital marketing and I was thinking of trying out a simple dropship store. Since I am a digital marketer in real life I decided to try a tough vertical... guitars. Mainly because playing guitar is a hobby and I had some interesting ideas on how to potentially market them. But before investing too much money and time I bought a guitar through Aliexpress. I picked one that was inexpensive and had a good number of sales (for guitars). Well, it looked like the shipper lost my order and didn't even ship the guitar for three weeks. But then it made it to ""inbound into customs"" in less than a week after that. But now that status hasn't changed in a month.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the idea might be feasible if I could get the product to buyers in less than thirty days. But I ordered this guitar in February and it has no sign of getting here any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

So do you think I just had an unlucky order? Or is this what I can expect trying to ship guitars into the country. Also, do you think I should just go ahead and dispute the order and try and get my money back? The seller had a 27-day guarantee when I ordered. They have since raised it to 40 days. But my screenshot at purchase shows the 27-day guarantee.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to run out of things I could improve (although I'm always looking) and I would really like to turn this into something.

So I decided to order some basic accessories to sell, and they denied me because I needed an invoice from a distributor or a letter from the manufacturer proving I had permission to sell the product. 

The manufacturer(Samsung and Microsoft) has been no help because I havent found a reliable phone number to, and the partnership account rep hasnt replied to my query in months, to get a letter. 

I finally get th money to buy a high quality product from the distributor to get an invoice, just to find out Amazon requires the invoice to show a minimum quantity of 10.

I'm reaching a point where I'm about to say screw Amazon and sell on my own, or sell some cheap branded accessories(mice, usbs, keyboards, etc) instead of the computers and tablets like I originally planned just to get the quantity and rating numbers I need.

dropship,Aussie sellers - question about using registered biz name on multiple stores,"Australian based question involving legalities around registering business names with ASIC and having multiple sites!

Say I want to test a bunch of ideas. This involves setting up domains and sites for 5+ niche products/categories of products. Say the sites are sweetassbooks.com, cooltechstuff.com, aussiehats.com... etc

I have a Sole trader ABN.

My question is – do I need to register a new “business name” for each of these domains? Or can I use one for all of them?

Assume they are .com not .com.au based. I can’t deal with the .com.au nightmare at this point so just your average .com :)

Registering a new business name for every idea would be a headache and expensive to boot – most of these sites are test sites and will sell barely anything and go nowhere. Others might do well. At $39 a pop just to register a name then pay more to test an idea out to see if it sells, it really shuts down my options.

Or, if I register ONE business name to ASIC, say “Cool Stuff Seller” for example, am I able to simply put that business name and ABN in the website footer/t&amp;cs/receipts to customers on all my multiple sites? Does the one real registered business name actually need to be in the .com? or logo?



TL/DR: Can I operate 3 or 5 distinct ecomm dropshipping stores (with .coms) that sell different things and have different “names” (domains) under the one registered business name IF I INCLUDE IT in the footer/receipts etc?

shopify,What I've Learned From Reviewing Tons of eCommerce Stores,"I've been reviewing eCommerce stores for a long time, and I decided to make a short writeup of things I've learned. Also, here is the latest installment of my live store reviews:[https://youtu.be/SQDKsHw8h5k](https://youtu.be/SQDKsHw8h5k)Here's what stood out to me from this episode:

* What's Above the Fold is Incredibly Important

The fold is essentially what someone sees right when they land on your website without scrolling. Some people have navigation bars that take up to a quarter of the screen, or banners and don't have a call to action. What you put at the top of your website is what controls the bounce rate, which means if people leave your website immediately or choose to stay. Take advantage of every pixel and make sure your best products are featured.

* Beef up your descriptions

Descriptions are powerful and you need to have the key benefits and how the product can help the consumer at the top of the description. Things such as material and specifications are important but don't but that at the top of the description.

* Keep your checkout page simple

Some people are trying to go crazy customizing the checkout. Keep it simple to keep the focus on checking out so that the customer is focused on pulling out their credit card.

* Necessary pages

Have an about us, contact us, and FAQ page somewhere on your website. These are things customers look for, so make them easy to find.

* Remove the powered by Shopify

It's simple and keeps your site professional. If you don't know how to do this, just look it up on Google.

* You need several products

I've seen some sites that only have 1-3 products. To keep your site looking professional and developed, I recommend 10-20 products minimum with 3-5 winning products. Once you find these winning products feature them on the home page on your website.

* Sense of urgency

You need something to encourage your customers to buy now rather than later. Use something like the countdown cart app so customers are more inclined to buy. Many times they think they'll come back later, but don't. You can also use something like Conversion Pirate at checkout to increase conversion rate.

* Social proof

This is also incredibly important. You can accomplish social proof with reviews, the sales pop app or another solution. Sales pop used to work really well but customers are starting to become more educated and in my opinion, it is starting to look tacky. It still works, but ideally, if you're using Aliexpress, use Alireviews, or tell your customers to write reviews on your site.

* Make an easy to understand return policy

This is something most customers will visit before they buy. Make sure it is obvious, clear, and to the point.

I'll probably make this a weekly thread and post more of this as time goes on.

dropship,What Percentage of Shopify Stores Are Successful? The answer may surprise you,"Have you guys ever wondered what percentage of Shopify stores are successful and what percentage fail?

Unfortunately Shopify doesn't provide us with this data and while there's not a 100% accurate way to know, I dug into some analytics I had in regards to how many Shopify affiliate sign-ups I've had and how many stores are still active and [I found that just over 2% of Shopify stores that I've referred are still around today.](https://imgur.com/WfvVcOj)

Now again this data isn't perfect, many of these stores someone signed up for a trial and never actually did anything. Some of these stores people may have setup the layout of the store and uploaded products but never actually put any effort into driving traffic. At the very least though I think this gives some insight into the success rates of Shopify stores.

If we try to get a bit more accurate I figured from what I've seen over the years maybe 6 out of 10 signups actually put an effort into creating a store and go beyond the trial period so that changes the numbers a bit and brings the success rate to a bit above 3%.

I'm curious to hear from you guys, does this number surprise you or is it what you'd expect?

&amp;#x200B;

So I have purchased an item from AliExpress a few weeks ago which I am planning to sell in the future. It arrived today. One thing thats concerning is on the address label on the packaging, it lists the weight of the item along with 'Value'. On my item, it said $2.00, which isn't the price I paid. I actually paid more but from the customer's point of view, they may see $2.00 on the packaging and be disgruntled that they paid $10 or $20 for example.

I've been researching and see [this user had the same problem](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sort-products-by-last-word-in-title/) and came up with a solution.

I have added the code from that page to the functions file and use the same ""surname"" set up. I also added the attribute ""surname"" (under Products &gt; Attributes).

Next I need to ""add a field called surname in the Custom Fields section of all products."" To do this, I've installed the plugin ""Product Import Export for WooCommerce"". This is where I'm stuck.

Never did any advertisement on it never bought a domain all because of the fear of failure. Recently I built up courage and started doing advertisement. And within the first 3 days I already got 33 sales. Had a profit margin of 40%. So I just wanna day thank you to everyone. Gonna reinvest the money I made into the store.,25,33,2019-04-19,ECOM,0.030237527564167976,0.672804594039917,0.2969578504562378
shopify,How To Add A Buy Button At Bottom Of Product Description,"Hey guys and girls! 

&amp;#x200B;

My name's Conner and I'm pretty new to reddit and this subreddit, so hopefully I'm not breaking any rules with this post. I'm definitely not trying to sell anything I just thought I'd share a useful tip I learned.

&amp;#x200B;

I just released a YT video showing people how to add a second buy button at the bottom of their Shopify product descriptions. I think this is a useful tip as many descriptions can be long and it is a hassle to scroll all the way to the top of the page if the potential customer decides they want to purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, if you are interested here is the link to the YT video --&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-XXuVzIFBQ&amp;t=29s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-XXuVzIFBQ&amp;t=29s)

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is against the rules to link to your YT channel, but I read the sidebar and I'm not spamming or linking to any referral content, so hopefully it's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,

ecommerce,"UPS ""My Choice"" = BS","Just learned this myself and I’m sure others don’t know as well. I recently had incoming merchandise I was waiting for. It hadn’t arrived, so I looked at the tracking. They claimed that they made a single attempt (BS, no truck showed, no slip left), and then they took it to a UPS store for me to pickup. Huh? I call the 800 number. Took 25 minutes to talk to an actual person. They tell me the shipper chose to set it up that way. Lie... They did not. I told the support person to redeliver, she said OK.

Two days later it’s still sitting at the store. I call the store… The guy tells me they will not redeliver it, even though support said they would. He admits this is happening all the time now, and gets complaints all the time, and flat out says the drivers are just lazy, sometimes not even making ONE attempt, and just bringing stuff to them to get rid of.

So I send in a complaint, thinking this is some rogue drivers doing this. Rep calls me back, says…  Nope, this is now ""normal policy"", and acts like I’m an idiot for not knowing this. I looked all over the UPS site. If this is mentioned there, I couldn’t find it. In fact, most of what I found still talks about 3 attempts being standard.

So basically, what this is, is a sort of quiet thing they’ve done, where apparently if a driver feels burdened, he can just dump stuff at a store, and the company is OK with that. I asked this rep… How is a seller supposed to explain this to a customer? Like… ""Oh yeah, sorry… You paid for shipping, but UPS decided you don’t deserve to actually GET the package you paid to have delivered. Now you have to get off your ass and go get it?"" And the fact that this is not a well publicized official policy, means the customer will just blame the seller. Especially when, as I found out first hand… their customer service is happy to lie and say the seller is the one that did it that way.

On the site you can sign up for “My Choice” where you can supposedly redirect the package back to you, but… Judging from what their own store guy said and other complaints I’ve seen… this is BS, they will not. It will just sit there. Needless to say, between this and many other issues I’ve had, I’ll be avoiding them as much as possible.

shopify,New brand launch help!,"Hi reddit!

This is my first post, as I've been lurking around trying to learn more from others.

I've been working on a clothing brand (premium streetwear clothing - very high-end store) for the past 6 months, it's been a long journey, it was a one-man job the whole time, nobody but me did anything to it. I've literally designed it from 0 to 99 and put all my love &amp; passion into creating it. I'm very proud of my hard work after all this time, and I can't wait to start seeing it making sales. I'd never want that hard work to be a waste. That's why I was &amp; am very patient about it. I made sure every aspect to look as good as possible.

Now as I'm about to launch, I'm pretty confused with the range of strategies I can do to advertise it and get it seen by people.

I've made a very professional video ad (about 35secs long) that showcases a set of products from a specific collection, and I was thinking about testing ads based on this video, so I had in mind in advertising this video a week before launch for awareness (the video mentions that the store will launch on a specific date), and shows a website where you can sign  up and get notified on launch day.

And after that, I'll just make ads with products, collections based on the winning interest and keep on developing from there.

Is this a good idea? Or is there any better approach for this?

Same for Instagram Profile / Facebook Page as well, how do I prepare well for this to launch perfectly and have enough followers on all ends.

Because I see a lot of new stores, they just get a bunch of bot likes/followers for evidence, because who would mention they just started? Please correct me if I'm wrong.

shopify,Requesting a review of our new site :),"Hi all!

First of all, I wanted to say thank you to the people that have commented on other websites reviews because I have probably sat hours and read each review and made changes to our website accordingly. There is A LOT of useful information thanks to y'all!

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I (recently wed) started a new baby clothing line together and this is the first time we are using a platform like Shopify. Due to a limited budget, we used one of the free templates and tried to give as much of a soft and clean touch as possible to keep our high quality brand image. We manage the inventory for all of our items and ship them ourselves which we try to create a more personal touch to every sale.

We would appreciate any feedback (both good and bad) in regards to our website. I am not sure if our front page is organized correctly, so I would also appreciate anything in regards to that. We started our Instagram and Facebook pages which are slowly growing (we are liking and commenting on a lot of users instagram posts). We have already had a few sales which is super exciting, but our traffic is still relatively low. 

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to advertising, would you recommend promoting certain products or the general store? Ive read several different opinions from other posts from focusing on Facebook page likes, to working on creating ads starting with View Content pixels, then Add to cart, etc. I just want to know what you would recommend for a store like us.

dropship,5 Tips To Increase Your Store’s Conversion Rate,"## 

# [the best product hunts tools](http://www.ecomhunt.com/?afmc=112)

Your online store’s conversion rate doesn’t just depend on how fast it loads and if it’s mobile friendly. There are many other technical and psychological factors that can drastically hurt your conversion rate if not applied properly.

Make sure to read these tips in order to maximize your store’s potential!

## Send Your Customers Straight To The Cart Page:

We don’t want our users to click on our “add to cart” button only for a small cart popup to appear and disappear after 3 seconds. We want them to checkout as fast as possible without any delays or interruptions. By transfering them straight to the cart page, we increase our chances to get a sale.

On most of the themes we used, ajax cart was set as default. Or a different kind of  popup cart. Make sure you change this option in the theme settings and transfer them to the cart page. You can also transfer them to the checkout page but we personally don’t use this option because some users get confused and leave. But you can always test it out and see what works best for you.

## Keep Your Cart Page Clean:

Our cart page is clean and doesn’t show any upsells or related products. Now, don’t get me wrong – Upsells and related products feed work well and can increase your average order to get you much more profit from one customer. But in our case, we were losing much more than winning.

What actually happened is that our customers were checking the upsells or the different products and ended up without buying anything. By giving them an option to check out different products, they got lost in the process and left. This is why we decided to change our system.

Instead of offering upsells and showing them other products, we decided to clean our cart page and first get a sale. Once we had that customer in our pocket, it was much easier to sell him something else numerous times by using personal email marketing or simply by retargeting him with different products on Facebook and other platforms.

In the future, if we wanted to increase our AOV(Average Order Value), we offered bundles on our product page and made sure our ad clearly displayed our deal. For example: Buy our “Neon Shoes” and get this “Neon Hoodie” for 40% off! And of course displaying the products in our video or photo ads.

## Don’t Give Your Customers Too Many Options:

By giving your customer too many options, he may really have a hard time to choose one. This is quite common with dropshippers who important products from aliexpress with a lot of variants. Instead of your customer spending 10 seconds reading and clicking on the “add to cart” button, he will be checking out all the colors and sizes or whatever options your product has. This is a big NO-NO and you’re going to lose a lot of customers to this.

Make sure to keep just a few relevant/popular variants available so your customer doesn’t get lost. A good read on the subject by [Psychologist Barry Schwartz: The paradox of choice](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en).

## Offer Multiple Payment Gateways:

This might be obvious to some of you but there are a lot of people who have only one single payment option on their store. If you’re only accepting credit card payments, adding PayPal can substantially increase your conversion rate. Even if you don’t like PayPal and have bad history with this company, it’s not a valid reason to deny this option from your customers. Same goes if you’re only accepting PayPal.

In case you can’t offer any other checkout options, It’s best to let your customers know about it. For example: If you’re only accepting PayPal, you can let your customers know that they can checkout on PayPal without having an account there. Simply by checking out as a guest.

Or if you’re only accepting credit cards, you can always set up a followup email for the ones who haven’t completed the checkout and ask if the lack of payment options made them leave without buying. And if the customer replies back, you can work stuff out and hopefully get him to purchase from you.

## Remind Your Customers About Your Store’s Deals:

If you’re running a FREE SHIPPING store, an announcement bar saying “FREE SHIPPING ON ALL ORDERS” isn’t enough. You need to constantly remind them about your free shipping promotion.

If he’s on your product page, make sure that “FREE SHIPPING” is written in your product title and description. When he goes to the cart page, make sure the text under the total price is saying something about FREE SHIPPING and not the regular “shipping and taxes calculated at checkout” text. This may cause confusion and you’re going to lose a potential customer.

Same goes with every other deal. You have to basically show it to your customers in every place possible on your store!

## To Sum It Up:

You need to always think as a 1st time customer visiting your store. Everything needs to be organized in a logical way so that the buying process is quick and easy.

ecommerce,Just launched - would love some feedback,"Hi everyone. I want to share a bit of my backstory for some context. This is a side project for me and I’m not attempting to make a full time career out of e-commerce. As an avid reddit user I wanted to reach out for some feedback. 

For the past 10 years I’ve worked in the financial sector (still do), partly for other companies and also through self employment. My career has comprised of roles in financial markets specifically as a trader, broker and fund manager. 

During this time I found myself putting pen to paper quite a bit, mainly for professional reflection (traders do lots of journaling) and as a result I’ve accumulated an abundance of useful notes that are likely worth something to many people. Recently, a close associate of mine who specializes in marketing and e-commerce suggested that I refine all of this information and categorize it, then he’d assist me in turning it all into a salable product (in eBook form in this case). I am working through this process now and there is quite a long way to go, but we have a good starting point and I agreed to launch it. I wanted to test the waters with what we’ve got so far so I don’t spend too much time on it going forward if it’s a bust. 

Not all of the information is relevant to trading or investing specifically, some of it is useful as general business knowledge too. I’m not certain how popular these products will be, if at all, but I have many ideas for different directions we can take this project in the future if it generates enough traffic and interest. 

We have brought on a couple of sponsors and affiliates to help sustain the site, and eventually this will help us to build something completely custom as opposed to the template layout currently being used. I have deferred all marketing and website related activity to my associate, I have very little to do with operations, I’m merely contributing the content and leveraging some of my industry relationships for the benefit of the project. Nonetheless, I would be interested to listen to any feedback you guys might have. Thanks in advance for taking the time.

So I’ve watched a ton of videos from a variety of gurus on youtube etc and there still seems to be some gaps with the small details I have questions on. 

I know everyone talks about automation and hiring VAs so you can focus on money making tasks etc. 

So...how does order fulfillment even work? When/IF you get an order, do you have to manually go to AliEx and place the order yourself with your own credit card etc? Or does Oberlo auto process the order and makes the order for you at AliEx? 

Also, when you hire a VA for order fulfillment, how are they fulfilling orders? You don’t give them a credit card do you? (Sounds super stupid) How are they paying for the orders? No one seems to get to that level of detail...

I may be completely misunderstanding how order fulfillment works here with Shopify, Oberlo, and AliEx...

[https://youtu.be/yG-5YSc5jlw](https://youtu.be/yG-5YSc5jlw)

Two major things I took away from this: 

1. Fixing a failing Facebook ad is simply a process. You look at your reporting screen and you see which part of the process is going wrong. Then you work on fixing that. 
2. Most of the time, the reason your ads fail is because your offer is weak. I completely agree with this. I see this all the time with clients and I've read this countless times in books, courses, etc. A strong offer is the #1 thing that will get people to buy from your ads -- above all else. It can turn a struggling business into a profit making machine. This video shows examples. 

Let me know (via comments/upvote) if you found this useful. 

This video is not mine -- I don't know the guy from Adam. Just saw it today.

shopify,Fiverr seller said grammar isn't important in product descriptions. Is she right?,"I paid a Fiverr seller to write product descriptions for my Shopify store and the finished descriptions had a lot of grammatical errors. When I brought this up to the seller, they said that I must be new to marketing and that they have 4-5 years of description writing experience and have never got any complaints. They said that description writing is different than article writing and that you're not bound by language structure.

Here are a few quotes from descriptions they've written:

1. Let your kitchen organized and helps you save even more space with this useful Wall Mounted Organizer.
2. Let you use in multiple ways i.e place it on shelf or hang it on wall and let it empty or place any other gadget in it, choice is all yours.
3. Let you keep your kitchen utensils dry, bacteria prevented and accessible on counter-top with Stainless Steel Kitchen Drain Storage. 
4. Let you get modern and stylish look to your place with this elegant Transparent Vase Planter.

ecommerce,Good eCommerce Site Other Than Shopify?,"Ok, so I am with Etsy Pattern website right now. The reason being is that I actually did start with Shopify originally, but after a few months they told me I am not allowed to use Shopify Payments (which not allowing has penalties) because I sell handmade hunting / pocket knives, and they only allow their payment gateway for culinary knives. So, with that said, I need to find a selling platform like Shopify that is ok with me selling my handmade folding / hunting knives. I am looking at what options like BigCommerce and Volusion and whatever else might be good like Shopify that is good with my product type. I like Etsy Pattern for the inventory sync however there is little to no SEO options on it so I am looking for something with more advanced options to building my site.",66,16,2019-04-26,ECOM,0.0168592669069767,0.9116072654724121,0.07153347134590149

ecommerce,AMA about mid-market/enterprise ecommerce,"I'm currently a solutions engineer for the [Workarea Commerce Platform](https://www.workarea.com), and have worked in ecommerce for the last 13 years across a number of roles, starting as a back-end developer, moving on to full-stack development and third party integration. For the last 3 years, instead of building features and integrations in code, I'm business-facing; talking to a lot of mid-market and enterprise professionals: ecommerce directors, marketers, merchandisers, CTO/CMO/CEO/etc, usually about complicated ecommerce builds and questions about selecting a platform that best suits retailers with the kinds of needs that go beyond the small-business-friendly platforms. Complicated shipping, integration with legacy software, automated merchandising, robust content strategies, in-store integrations, internationalization, etc. 

 [You can get a little more detail over at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leviathant/), a site that I avoided as a developer, but has become much more important in my current role.

I know /r/ecommerce tends to have a lot of posts about much smaller scale efforts, but I also suspect there are more than a few longer-tenured professionals that lurk, and hope this spurs on an interesting conversation. 

Every day I work with folks using Salesforce Commerce Cloud (aka Demandware), SAP Commerce Cloud (Hybris), Magento (Adobe), Workarea Commerce, Oracle Commerce Cloud/ATG, etc on how to solve for day-to-day ecommerce needs, about experiences with partners (ESPs, OMSs, ERPs, RFPs, UGC, more three letter acronyms than you can imagine) and hope that my tenure in the space might foster discussions that aren't necessarily typical of this sub. While I'm happy to take questions, I would also encourage anyone else in the field to jump in.

There were a few preliminary questions posed in [the announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/bept2d/upcoming_ama_all_things_midmarketenterprise/) which I'll start off with in the comments below. I'll be jumping in and out of the thread over the next few hours, and even though I'm officially wrapping at 4pm eastern, I'll probably continue to answer questions that come in after that, whenever I have time.

shopify,I finally picked an ESP. It took me two months. Here's what I learned along the way.,"As we all know Mailchimp and Shopify are having a divorce. I’m a small business owner who has used Mailchimp for five years, and who for the last two months has been testing out all the different ESP (email service provider - I just learned that acronym too) I could get my hands on to figure out what to do next. This post is very long. Sorry! But believe it or not it feels like I’m scratching the surface of what I learned.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Decision: I’m keeping Mailchimp for now but I slimmed down my list and add Privy. I’m looking for the right moment to switch to Klaviyo but it’s much more expensive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s how I came to that decision.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, Mailchimp is great. Do not leave simply because their Shopify app is going away. Using the free app ShopSync I was able to delete the Mailchimp app and still be connected to my Shopify store. It took 10 minutes. This whole divorce this is way overblown.  

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve learned that marketing online is not about simply about collecting a huge email list and blasting out a newsletter each week. To me ESPs have these four main factors:

1. Type of email it can send (notifications, automated transactional, and newsletter). 
2. How well can it segment my audience?
3. Can it create multiple signup forms and popups? 
4. How much does it cost? 

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s look at each factor starting with type of email: 

&amp;#x200B;

Newsletter campaigns: Many of you will be surprised to learn that not every ESP can do a full list blast. There are several inexpensive services ($20 a month) that only do automation but can’t blast the list. This feature is worth paying for IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Notification emails:  These emails are the 16 standard Shopify emails found under Settings &gt; Notifications. They are massively undervalued. Messages like order confirmations, account invitations, shipping delivery and so on are poured over by customers. Open rates can be 90% with many customers opening them multiple times. Why not sneak in a discount code into that email?! However, in order for these emails to be adjusted you have to build the email in an ESP, and then copy and paste the HTML it into Shopify. There is no other way to do it. This is dumb, but it is what it is. You may need help doing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Automation or transactional emails: These are your customer win-backs, best-customer, abandon carts emails and so on. Every store should use these emails. Automated email marketing is significantly cheaper than advertising, and compliments advertising anyway because once you’ve paid for the people to get into your funnel you might as well keep marketing to them.  

&amp;#x200B;

Automation requires segmentation, and segmentation is one of the main reasons why Klaviyo is so good and so expensive. For example every ESP can create abandon cart emails but Klaviyo can tell the size of the cart and can send different emails based on cart size. Klaviyo can even track a customer's behavior and email them even if they don’t add to cart. For example if a customer visits the same product page three times over a few days you can set Klaviyo to email that customer an offer. How crazy is that?! This is miles better than Mailchimp. Mailchimp can hold its own against other ISPs but it gets killed by Klaviyo. 

&amp;#x200B;

Building popups, sign up forms, and embeds or landing pages: Your email list can only grow if you have great looking popups pulling them in. Mailchimp is perfectly capable of making one, really good popup signup form. But it can only make one per list (basically per website), and the targeting is somewhat limited. This is where the Privy app comes in. Privy can segment popups! That’s right, if someone has viewed a product a few times over several days but hasn’t added it to the cart you can offer them a deal via popup. If a customer is about to abandon a cart you can show them a popup and offer them an instant discount if they checkout now, with a variation of discount size based on cart size to boot. It gets crazy. Klaviyo’s triggered popups are almost as good as Privy’s, but not quite. Privy can A/B test for example while Klaviyo cannot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, price: I wanted Klaviyo bad but I’m still trying to convince myself it’s worth 4x the price of Mailchimp. I literally trimmed 17K subscribers off my Mailchimp list to try and lower the price of Klaviyo to switch. Per a Redditor's advice I sent out a win-back 50% off discount to a segment of dead lead customers. I kept anyone who opened the email. It was about 0.1%. I was happy to be rid of those email address and saved myself $100 a month on Mailchimp. I added Privy for $70 a month, so I’m saving $30 a month and gaining a powerful new tool in Privy. Still, I want Klaviyo.

&amp;#x200B;

Klaviyo is free to use until you start sending emails, so I’m syncing my Privy and Mailchimp accounts to it while I build data and templates. When the moment is right (if Klaviyo has a sale or something) I’ll switch to Klaviyo exclusively. If I find that I’m getting everything I need out of the tools I’m using now then I’ll stick with this current combo.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Part 2: Klaviyo is about 4x more expensive than Mailchimp but it can segment more granularly and make better popups. Mailchimp is awesome and worth keeping if you can’t afford Klaviyo. Use ShopSync to connect Mailchimp it after May 4th. Privy is terrific at making popups and was the most interesting find on my journey that I ended up signing up for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does it make any sense to prioritise the Australian audience when most suppliers are in China and the US?

&amp;#x200B;

The counterfeiter doesn't appear to be stopping, when we shut one down they simply open another on a different hosting site. 

  
What is the best way in getting this counterfeiter shut down or punished for his actions?

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all input is much appreciated.

dropship,Question about testing creatives,"When you guys want to test ads to see what creative or text works best how do you do it?

Do you create 5 different $5  ad sets with the same interests and locations but different creatives on each? 

Or

Do you create 1 $25 adset and within that adset create 5 ads that’s use the same adset to see which performs better. 


I’m trying the first option but I’m thinking since the adsets are targeting similar locations and interests they are competing against each other and driving my CPC up.

dropship,How to safely source products for your business,"I've worked as an international buyer and company GM over the last 5 years and have experience in both online sourcing methods and in person travel, being mentored through a company with a lot of importing experience. I see many people struggling with this side of business and am passionate about solving these issues, having started a new sourcing platform that fixes the issues I've encountered over the years (I'll link to it at the bottom). I'll give my take on how to source safely with current popular methods and give some insights most probably don't know about.

&amp;#x200B;

If sourcing online, try [1688.com](https://1688.com/), they're more competitive than alibaba and most other sourcing platforms(Yes its owned by Alibaba but the platform is less saturated with buyers and suppliers are more willing to negotiate) I'm not sure how experienced you are but here's a few tips. Never show that you're a newbie. Try to be as professional as possible while being very friendly. If working with China/Asia, Chinese business is largely based on relationships. Be friendly, interact with your salesperson and get wechat. Also try to upsell yourself and your company. If you can pull it off, tell them you're first looking to place some smaller trial orders as you want to switch suppliers. Its a lot easier to negotiate once you have an existing relationship going with the supplier. Also get as much info as possible, photos, video, ask technical questions, etc. The more diligent and professional you are the less likely they'll think they can get away ripping you off.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are paying through Alibaba, know that Alibaba only covers whatever is exclusively specified in your contract, unless you have VERY solid proof, and even then its a gamble. Alibaba is funded by their suppliers so they don't like to open disputes and chase suppliers down for money. (Alibaba has to pay you out of their own pocket first and then chase down the supplier to get paid back) if you win. Also, remember the $xxx inspection you have to do to use trade assurance. Once your order is delivered, if anything is wrong just to open a dispute means you have to get another inspection at your location which can cost $2,000+ and you only get reimbursed if you win. They purposely make it difficult to dispute orders as a deterrent, I strongly suggest trying to solve it outside of Alibaba if you're not sure you'll win. Also contracts are very difficult to enforce in China unless you have legal representation. China government tends to lean toward their people in most situations. If its a small order, just try to be as informed as possible, if its a larger one, maybe pay for an inspection from Beureu Veritas or any of the big guys that won't rip you off. Though you're looking at a $500+ cost. It is worth it though, as suppliers see it as a deterrent to cutting corners, and you also get an inspection (If your margins can afford it)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're flying in, check out the Canton Fair trade show. Over 200k buyers and 60k suppliers concentrated in a location. Generally these are companies of quality who have $ to spend buying a booth and flying their employees out. China is also becoming more difficult to source for lower end products. Their younger generation is less willing to work in factories and their middle class is growing really fast. In fact their domestic market is largely competing with exporting, meaning they're less likely to give on price.

If you're going to fly in, I suggest developing manufacturing countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, etc. Lower quality generally from inexperience, but very willing to do business as they're off the beaten path upcoming companies.

I'm the founder of Veribuy, an upcoming product sourcing platform that bridges online and in-person sourcing methods. We're creating a no-risk sourcing platform using newly available video livestreaming tech that allows you to tour factories and inspect products as if you were there yourself.

I've been a buyer for over 5 years and decided I, among my peers in the industry, could benefit from todays technology to finally take the risk out of product sourcing. Please take a look at the website, we'd love any feedback at all!

Also if you're interested, we're giving away $500CAD to one of the first 1000 individuals to take our survey.

dropship,How to build your own brand while dropshipping?,"Hey I'm new to this ecomm game and just discovered all you guys in the ecomm space. You guys inspire and motivate me. You mention dropshipping a lot and I'm starting it today. Have a few questions. 

1) Correct me if I'm wrong, but since dropshipping is usually selling a brandless products (or a product that isnt your brand), is the whole goal to dropship brandless products to test demand and then going all in with your own private labeling after you measure the demand? I assume people don't just go all in private labeling without measuring demand. 

2) if not how do you create a brand while dropshipping? White label?

ecommerce,Help needed - work flow,"Hi all,

Got a question here that is bothering me and alone cannot find a good solution so, hopefully someone can open my eyes to a good way of doing this.

Without entering much detail, I’m not new to e-commerce, been around for  more than 10y.

So, a few years ago I let go amazon an eBay to focus myself on B2b. It’s going great and that part is very good and stable (for now). But I missed the thrill of the client sales. The notifications of sales in the morning. The adventure if one can put it in that way.

I’ve maintained a Woocommerce website for B2C but as I never gave it much attention it never got traction (still does a couple 1000 euros a month). Site is still on and I was planning on using it.

So now I decided to the marketplaces gig again and push the website at the same time.

Products found, sourced , lists done and sales start to enter. But, everything is in “manual mode”.  I create the listings in amazon, WC and others, transcribe shippings to a excel, update in both sides, everything manual.

How do I automate this? Is it better to use a platform where everything goes and only work there? Do I centralize in woocommerce? I’m lost.  Also, a few products are fulfilled by a 3rd party.

I would appreciate if someone could point me out on how they did solve this. It’s fun for 2 orders a day, but then with all the rest of work, i get lost. And I’m not doing 2 sales a day...

And sorry for the English, not my 1st language.",13,9,2019-04-30,ECOM,0.03840382769703865,0.922874927520752,0.0387212410569191

dropship,This is how to find Winning Products on Amazon to sell on eBay.,"https://youtu.be/y5ZdHdlhGNo

First step I go to the bestseller list of Amazon and select a random product from any category and search on eBay for the same product. 
If you can't find anything, simply take Amazon's next product. 
Step 2. I'm filtering new eBay results, buying now (and sold). 
Step 3. If the price is higher than the Amazon price, I will scan the results and open the listings in a new tab.
Step 4. We should now have a few taps open with more expensive products than on Amazon. But we want to see more, so we're clicking on other items from the sellers. 
Step 5. Now we have a lot of products on Amazon that could also be cheaper. We're going to filter again just to look at the items sold.
Step 6. Go through all items and check on Amazon to see if they're cheaper. 
Step 7. List it to eBay if you found a winner. That's it. It's pretty simple. It should be possible for any noobie to do this. 

BUT let's just give it a twist. I've developed a chrome extension to make it even easier and faster. 
It creates an overlay over the eBay site and displays the price of the Amazon next to the eBay listing as well as the percentage of the price difference. 
You can copy the Asin with one click or click to the Amazon item page. 

The chrome extension is called Drop It Studio",4,8,2019-04-30,ECOM,0.027182327583432198,0.9338781237602234,0.038939520716667175
