dropship,How many suppliers should I use ? Less than 2 ? Less than 10 ? As much as I want ?,"Hi dropshipping peeps !~ 

I’m fairly new to drop shipping, I’m currently in my research phase, setting up the business plan and all that. My site is not set up yet but I did find a niche that I really want to try. 

I don’t want to tell you guys exactly what my niche is but I can say, without being to specific that it is related to women fashion. 

My question is, is it really bad to use a lot of different suppliers from Aliexpress, at least in the beginning ? 
For exemple, I did find a great supplier which can provides some great dresses, but he lacks accessories. I find two other suppliers that have the perfect jewels and accessories for my niche. 
I also find some great vendors for underwear products. 
In the end, I might be at 6-7 different Aliexpress vendors. 

I read on this subreddit that it wasn’t really recommended, as it’s great to build a relationship with one supplier to get leverage for  future businesses. 

Do any of you guys uses a lot of different suppliers ? Is it risky ? What’s your take on this ?

I have a client wanting to sell blocks fitness sessions (let's say 5 and 10 sessions), then wants their clients to be able to book them as and when until the quantity is exhausted).

&amp;#x200B;

The sessions are also available as Pay as you Go, so the bookable product is already there. I am hoping to find a way to give a subscriber a 100% discount on the product to value of the number of blocks they ordered. i.e. they buy a subscription of 5 sessions non-recurring, and that entitles them to book 5 sessions @ 0 cost.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone got any ideas on how to do this? or perhaps a really obvious, better solution.

Due to unfortunate circumstances of them not allowing me time off, I had to leave the job and have been looking around for what to do after the fact. When I was working there, my store had a promotion of buy a shoe and get a second shoe half off. We had 3 or 4 ""Bulk Buyers"" that would come in and buy $1,000+ worth of shoes using this promotion, and then flip them on what i'm assuming is Amazon using their Amazon Fulfillment program.   


Sorry for the long intro, but I have been flipping streetwear/sneakers for the past few months using reddit/FB marketplace - and was wondering what the barriers of entry are to getting into something like this. I have a decent amount of capital to establish a starting inventory, and certainly can afford the Amazon Seller account - but I guess I am just looking for some advice on whether this is something achievable with a capital of $1,000-$2,000 and a dream. Also would like some insight on the saturation of the shoe market on amazon (Particularly Vans/Asics) and if this isn't the way to go, maybe another place I can start.

ecommerce,Best verbiage to explain no phone support option to inquiring customers?,"I've got a successful ecommerce business specializing in customized physical products in the $70-300 range. My website is clean and the vast majority of customers place their order without any assistance from us and are very happy with the final result. I have Intercom chat on my site where I field basic customer service questions, but the vast majority of the questions are answered by their Answer Bot service providing canned answers to frequently asked questions (and I work towards answering these on my site when they are repetitive - things like ""When can I expect my delivery,"" etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, I get customers whose only communication (either through our Intercom chat app or the Contact Us link) are to ask us to call them, or asking for a phone number for their order. Being as this is a side business and I don't always have the time or the ability to make outgoing phone calls (let alone field incoming phone calls as they may occur), I'm trying to come up with a good talking point that addresses this. I understand that not being able to provide phone support may cost me sales (in my experience, the phone customers are the most problematic in placing the order, and usually don't follow through), but I'm looking to placate a good number of customers who are looking for phone support with a good answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's [Mailchimp's](https://mailchimp.com/help/mailchimp-support-options/) answer, for example:

&gt;Why We Don't Have Phone Support   
&gt;  
&gt;Mailchimp limits support to online communication for a few reasons.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Low prices**  
Online support allows us to keep Mailchimp’s pricing down, while maintaining a feature-rich application.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Easy sharing of visuals and instructions**  
Online support also helps our team gather system details and other information so that we can troubleshoot effectively. We’ll send you resources like articles, videos, or personalized instructions to help you solve problems and get back to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's good, but doesn't really apply to me, as I'm not trying to be a price leader (though I can probably speak to that point), and I'm not really sharing visuals nor instructions to customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I'd like this answer on a FAQ page (not that anyone really reads these, 0.12% of my pageviews last month) as well as an autoreply to customers who ask on our Chat as well as email us asking us to call them (if I'm not able to make the call).

Recently in my store I've added polos to my collection. I had great success with t shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts and beanies so I thought to myself polos would be a great next step for me!

Turns out... Not so much. Polos aren't selling as great as I'd hoped, and that's putting it lightly. I have a lot of it in stock, especially compared to my other product lines and I want to sell as many polos as I can this coming Christmas, as I'm not sure my other products will have the stock to last this period.

I'll take this as a lesson to perform proper market research before stocking up on a new product line but right now I need help selling polos.

ecommerce,Ecommerce - Feel so down and depressed + What I've learned,"Last project that I've been working was for ecommerce. I didn't go to ecommerce selling just because is such a hot topic and everyone want to do that nowadays. It's been my passion, but I've learned many things during that failure.

**What I've learned is :**

\- Don't go to ecommerce just because someone on youtube is bullshitting and making money from all naive people (99% they don't make 1$ from ecommerce - Here are few titles How I'm making 99.999$ from ecommerce and so can you! Ecommerce and how to start - EASILY!)

\- Do it, but there's a high risk and it's getting day by day higher due to competition

\- High risk that big companies can eat/ copy you easily.

\- Most likely you will need more than 1k$

\- I've talked with manufacturer and he said that big companies are ordering from 210.000 pieces or even more. That's same as 42 containers :) so they can easily get really really low price.

\- Branding is everything, but not everything because for branding you'll need time and money.

\- Don't watch all this gurus, they are good talkers, nothing more.

\- Big companies have contract with shipping companies for much more lower price than I have.

Now I've got like 50 pcs left of products, that I want to sell and potentially close the site, because what I saw is that many bigger companies added their product to their site simmilar to mine, with much lower price, because they can easily afford to invest for 10.000 - 100.000 pcs or even more.

I feel down, because I invested so much time (8 - 12 hours a day or even more), so much effort, but big companies can eat you in 3...2.. 1 seconds, currently my investment was about 1400€ - 1560$, lost also job and I feel like crap. I'll be soon 24 years old and I'm doing, learning all this since I was 15 years old.

I never felt so down, as I do now, I just want to cry. Most likely I'll just go to new idea. What would you recommend me to do? I just want to boost my energy back.

Thank you all for your support and energy.

I'm also curious about how these apps interact with shipping rate calculators.

First, I don't know whether to go for the only app available, [Shipping Rates Calculator Plus](https://apps.shopify.com/shipping-rates-calculator-plus?surface_detail=shipping+calculator&amp;surface_inter_position=1&amp;surface_intra_position=2&amp;surface_type=search), or to follow the help center's [guide for adding a rate calculator to the cart page](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/customization/cart/add-shipping-calculator#sectioned-themes). In either case, will the calculator reflect the custom rules as defined by whichever shipping app I choose, or will it give Shopify's weight-based rates only?

Thanks!

shopify,Shopify development - first timer questions/queries,"Hi All,

I have recently started looking at shopify to develop an ecommerce website and have a few queries I hope you can clear up.

I am a developer by trade, so I would like to be able to create my own custom content for the site.

After looking around for a while, I am left slightly confused about how custom development actually works on shopify.

Take this for example, I want to create a 'featured products' component on my website. This component should go off to the store front api, pull in the list of featured products and then display them neatly on the screen using a custom HTML template I would make.

After researching for a while, I am confused about how I should go about developing this. Should I just code it straight into my template liquid files (if yes any links to tutorials would be greatly appreciated). Or should I be creating a 'private app' which I can drop into my website? If yes to the second option, am I thinking about apps in the right way? Are they essentially a vehicle to allow developers to create custom 'plugins' which can be referenced via a templates code?

So in my example I would create an app to fetch featured products and display them on screen. And then I would reference that app via the template code (in the file where I want featured products to appear), pass in any params and the featured products would then be rendered on the page?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the above is a bit rambley, I am just confused about how to actually develop custom templates and features as I am a first time shopify developer.

&amp;#x200B;

Any info would be much appreciated!

4. Sizing charts.  Adding in my size chart and removing it from products that don't need it. 
5. Proofreading my blogs // making them longer with more keywords and links to reputable sources.
6. Improving page load speed (as of right now, it is incredibly slow.)

1. Honest criticism (even if it is brutal).
2. Any pointers to look more professional?
3. Anything I'm missing?
4. Should I change my logo? (made it myself, but might look into paying someone to make a better one).
5. Should I replace the t-shirt images?

woocommerce,Bugs with the shop sidebar and Reset Password Email,"Hello everyone,

Recently I started to work on an woocommerce  store, but I have some problems with some bugs. I tried to search the  issues on web, but I did not have any succes. I found your community and  I told myself that you, much more experienced when it comes to  woocommerce, can help me. I have the following bugs. I want to mention  the fact that I use the Jupiter Theme.

1. Reset Password Email. When I reset a password I recieve the default Wordpress reset email instead of the Woocommerce one.  
  2. Product Category sidebar. I use an sidebar on my shop page, an  sidebar with an product filter, but when I enter on an category page, I  don't have any sidebar and I can't find an option for this.   
 3. On the mobile I see the shop sidebar at the end of the page, is there a way to move it at the beggining of the page?

shopify,How to create awesome product photos without spending a ton of money,"The first thing people look at when visiting your store is the photos. If your photos create a good first impression, they’ll stick around to browse and read more about your products. But if your photos suck, visitors are out.

You don’t have to spend a ton of money to create great photos. Here’s how to do it for less than $20. (I'm not trying to sell you anything here. I was a product photographer in a previous life and just want to share what I've learned.)

**Consider the Light**

Photography literally means “writing with light.” Well lit photos always perform better than dark, poorly exposed photos.

But you don’t need a bunch of fancy lights. You just need diffused sunlight AKA shade.

If you’re shooting inside, set up near a bright window. You can pin a white sheet or paper over the window if the light is too harsh.

To even out the light coming from the window side, set up a piece of white posterboard opposite the window. That will reflect the light back onto your product, softening and balancing it.

If you’re shooting outside, do it in the shade. You can use the same reflector trick to eliminate shadows.

**Consider the Camera**

So many people think you have to have a big, fancy, expensive camera to take good photos. Nope. Not true.

Your phone will work just fine. And if you have a newer phone, it might even work better than a professional camera!

I tell you this as someone who owns several professional cameras. Some of the phones that have been released in the last couple of years have extremely advanced photo software. That means the photos that come out of my phone look better than the photos that come out of my $1,500 DSLR.

Professional cameras have their place. But they really aren’t necessary for most product photos.

**Set up a Background**

The focus of your product photos is the products, duh. So you need to get rid of all distracting elements to create a clean background. Think about how Amazon does it – well lit products against a plain, white background.

You can use a white sheet or a roll of white kraft paper to get the same effect. Pin it to a wall, then push a table up to it. Drape the background over the table, creating a seamless transition between the vertical wall and horizontal table.

**Shoot All Angles**

Customers can’t pick up and examine your products, so you want to replicate that experience through your images. Make sure to take a variety of shots showing your product from different angles.

Pro tips:

* If you need better light, make your own light tent out of a plastic storage container with white paper taped to it.
* Use tape to hold your products in place.
* For clothing, use a mannequin, hanger or an artistic flatlay.
* For necklaces, cut two notches in the top of a piece of cardboard and use it as a bust.
* For earrings, string up a piece of fishing line to hang them from.

**Get Some Lifestyle Shots**

People buy based on emotion. And it’s way easier to make someone feel an emotion when you have photos of people emoting.

Plus, humans are naturally drawn to faces. Showing shiny, happy people using your products is a great way to grab attention and make people feel good about your products.

So grab some friends, give them your products and take a bunch of photos of them actively engaging with the products.

Pro tips:

* Do your photo shoot in the hour before sunset for the best light (photographers call it the golden hour).
* Use friends or models that match your buyer persona.
* Get lots of angles – close-ups, distant shots, high and low vantage points, etc.

**Don’t Forget Post-Processing**

If you get your lighting right, the photos that come straight out of your camera will look okay. But editing them will make them look excellent.

The Snapseed app is great for editing right on your phone. If you’d rather edit on your computer, check out Canva.

The main things to focus on are brightness and contrast. You may also need to do some color correction by adjusting the image tint or color balance.

**Conclusion**

Images are the first thing visitors notice on your store, and high quality images translate to high quality products. Take an afternoon to set up a photo shoot and get it done!",7,32,2018-12-11,ECOM,0.04261336475610733,0.9241847991943359,0.033201877027750015

ecommerce,Looking for an e-commerce system that can generate order slips for different departments.,"I run a barbecue restaurant and currently use WooCommerce to accept online orders. I'm using a slew of different plugins to make this thing functional. I'm hitting a wall with one issue. We have several departments in the restaurant- Meat, Side Dishes and Bakery. When an order comes in, I need the system to check if there are products in the order from the different departments. If yes, it prints out the appropriate slip. If no, it does nothing.  

  

For example- an order comes in for 5 pounds of brisket and 2 pies. The system will print out the main invoice, which has checkboxes for MEAT / SIDES / BAKERY. Because there were meat and desserts orders, the appropriate meat and bakery department slips print out as well.

The first thing I'm worried is that if the products won't ship to the customers. I'm selling a product that has 200-300 sales on Aliexpress, 4.7/4.8 in rating and around 70 reviews.  
I'm worried that if it's a scam or something I will get screwed if I keep scaling it into high volumes and then everyone does a chargeback.

The other problem is that I have very little money on hand ($90 USD) and that means that I can't fulfill orders instantly and by that have to wait 3-7 days before I can fulfill them (Except for the money I have which is limited). This will might slow down the growing progress dramatically.

ecommerce,Guide: Predicting the impact of promotions on sales with Google Sheets,"([xpost r/analytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/a4vf7g/predicting_the_impact_of_promotions_on_sales_with/))

Sales season is on. Black Friday and Christmas are traditionally some of the promotion strongest dates during the year. However for many marketing analysts and data driven marketers a lot of uncertainty develops on how to predict the outcome of promotional efforts. Obviously most promotions will probably lead to more orders, but to how much incremental revenue will it lead? Can it even have a negative effect by cannibalizing sales in the time following the promotions? Or is the overall effect positive nonetheless?

*So imagine if you had a predictive model with which you can forecast the effects of your planned promotions. Giving you more certainty on how big your sales revenue will be.*

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how develop such a forecasting model for your business based on past promotions. All you need is Google Sheets and a free solver add-on. I recommend working along in the provided sheet to truly understand everything.

## Defining the task

For this example you are given the historical daily revenue for an online retailer for the last two and a half years up until 2018-11-28 (obviously the techniques in this model can be used for other products such as online courses, software and others as well). In the past years the retailer ran 20% and 30% promotions reducing the price of all sold products respectively. Promotions were run on random days as well as during Black Friday and before Christmas.

We now want to find out a) what the impact of those promotions is, b) if it makes more sense to run a 20% or 30% promotion for overall revenue and c) if a promotion should be run during upcoming Christmas time.

## Preparing the data

Formatting and cleaning data is usually the first step you have to take for every data analysis. As we are dealing with quite a simple data set here (revenue and dates) and the data has been prepared upfront there is not much to do in terms of cleaning and formatting.

However we still have to do some preparations for our upcoming analysis. As we want to investigate the impact of promotions we have to indicate the dates on which promotions happened. Furthermore we need to  indicate if the promotions had any visible impact on the days after the promotions, i.e. negatively due to the cannibalization of revenue.

Both has been done already in the provided sheet. In column E – H a “1” indicates that a event has occurred respectively. E.g. a “1” In cell E2 would mean a 30% promotion has happened on 2016-01-01, while a 1 in cells E3 – E5 means a negative after-promotion effect was observed on those days.

Days of the week and seasonality usually have an impact on sales as well (e.g. weekdays vs. weekends, summer month vs December), which is why we want to factor in those as well.

There are two simple formulas we can use here: MONTH() and WEEKDAY() which will give you month and the day of the week for a reference cell respectively. Those formulas have been used in  column B and C.

That’s it for preparation. Obviously even though everything above is already provided in our example data you would still have to do it for your own datasets.

## Building a basic model

What we are going to do is build is a model, which forecasts sales based on the impact of seasonality and promotions. We will have the following five factors influencing our sales prediction:

1. A constant as a basis
2. Influencing effects for the day of the week
3. Influencing effects for the month
4. Influencing effects for a promotion day
5. Influencing effects for the days after a promotion

This means for each day the forecast of revenue will be calculated by the following equation:

Predicted revenue =  Constant + \[day of the week effect\] +  \[month effect\] + \[20% promotion effect\] + \[days after 20% promotion effect\] +\[30% promotion effect\] + \[days after 30% promotion effect\]

Put those individual parameters in cell Q2:Q27 and a 100 in the respective cells in column R. Those are only trial values and will act as coefficients.

We will use the solver to estimate the coefficients, which will make the model fit best to our data, i.e. minimizing the (squared) error between our forecasts and the historical data. But more on that later on .

Next step is to write the actual formula, which corresponds to above equation. In cell M2 put the following formula and drag it down the whole column:

=$R$2 + VLOOKUP(B2,$Q$4:$R$15,2,FALSE) + VLOOKUP(C2,$Q$17:$R$23,2,FALSE) + E2\*$R$24 + F2\*$R$26 + G2\*$R$25 + H2\*$R$27

R2 represents the constant. VLOOKUP(B2,$Q$4:$R$15,2,FALSE) picks up the coefficient for each month while VLOOKUP(C2,$Q$17:$R$23,2,FALSE) picks up the coefficient for the day of the week. If a promotion occurred on a given day E2\*$R$24 and G2\*$R$25 will pick up the effects of a 20% and 30% promotion respectively, while F2\*$R$26 and H2\*$R$27 will do the same for after promotion day effects.

Now you’ll calculate squared error for each day. This can be done simply by putting =(D2–M2)\^2 into N2 and dragging it down the column. Sum all squared errors up in cell Y4.

One last thing you have to do before using the solver is to average all values of the day of the week and months values. You can do that by putting =AVERAGE(R17:R23) in into V4 and =AVERAGE(R4:R15) into V5. We are doing this as we will add constraints to the Solver model, which constrain the average day of the week and the average month to equal 0. We are doing this as those constraints make sure that a day of the week or month with a positive effect has a higher than average revenue and a day of the week or month with a negative effect has a lower than average revenue.

If you haven’t so far: No it’s time to download the solver. After doing so click on Add-ons -&gt; Solver -&gt; Start to set it up:

We want to minimize objective cell Y4 by changing values R2:R27, while constraining V4:V5 = 0.

So basically what we are doing is we are minimizing the squared error between the historical revenue data and our fictional forecast by changing the coefficients for each of our above defined five factors. When you are done setting up the Solver click on “solve”.

The outcome tells you a couple of things. E.g. a 30% promotion day raises (all else being equal) the revenue by $6116. Weekends are revenue wise a lot better than other week days and December accounts for a major sales raise as well. Days after a promotion usually lead to a drop in revenue.

## Evaluating the model

You can evaluate the model by calculating the R2 value between the forecasts and the actual historical revenue. Plug =RSQ(D2:D1064,M2:M1064) into cell Y5 for this. The formula calculates the percentage of the variation in revenue, which is explained by the forecasting model. In our case we should get a 0.59, which means that the independent variables of the five factors explain 59% of the daily variation of the revenue. Obviously as such the model has some room for improvement.

In order to do so we’ll try to spot any outliers in the daily forecast accuracy. As a first step calculate the error between the forecast and the historical daily revenue. Do so by putting =D2–M2 into cell O2 and copying it down the column. Calculate a close approximation to the standard error of the forecast with the standard deviation of the errors with the formula =STDEV(O2:O1064) in cell Y6.

We define outliers if the absolute value of the forecast error exceeds two times the standard error. So as a next step we want to identify the outliers fitting into this definition. For this we will use conditional formatting. Select range O2:O1064 and click on Format -&gt; Conditional Formatting -&gt; Add new rule. In the “Format if…” dropdown menu choose “Custom formula is” and put =abs(O2)&gt;=2\*$Y$6 in the box.

This will highlight all outliers within above definition.

And, surprise surprise we will find clusters of outliers around Black Friday and before Christmas, both we did not include in our original model. However, obviously people are shopping a lot more during these dates (e.g. 12/01 – 12/17) and less after (e.g. 12/18 – 12/31).

## Improving the model

Now that we know what caused the outliers and thus a lower forecasting accuracy we can improve our model by adding those factors to our original five factors.

As such we’ll add Black Friday, After Black Friday, Christmas sales, After Christmas into the headers of the columns I:L in order to be able to mark the occurrence of those events for each day similar to what we did before for the promotions. As such we’ll add the coefficients for those new factors in Q28:R31 as well.

Last adjustment we have to do now is to add the factors in our forecasting calculation. Put the following formula into Cell M2 and drag it to M1064 (we added the Black Friday, Christmas and the days after those events respectively as factors):

=$R$2 + VLOOKUP(B2,$Q$4:$R$15,2,FALSE) + VLOOKUP(C2,$Q$17:$R$23,2,FALSE) + E2\*$R$24 + F2\*$R$26 + G2\*$R$25 + H2\*$R$27 + I2\*$R$28 + J2\*$R$29 + K2\*$R$30 + L2\*$R$31

Now run the solver again with the added variables:

Adding those variables improved R2 drastically to 0.88, which means the variables explain 88% of the daily variation of the revenue

## The actual forecasting

So far we have only worked on the prediction model. Next step is obviously to forecast sales revenue with this model until the end of the year and to examine what impact a 20% or 30% promotion has. This actually the easy part.

First copy the formula from cell M1064 to all cells M1065:M1097. Next mark the Christmas sales time and days after the Christmas sales in column K and L (this is quite easy here as the change in sales revenue is quite obvious. However it might be more difficult to spot in real life data.)

This will give you a prediction on what revenue to expect for December without any promotions: An overall revenue of $175,734.

Let’s try now what will happen, if we have a 20% promotion on 2018-12-01. Plug in the indicators into G1067 and for the after promotion effects into H1068:H10670 respectively. The overall revenue for December would be $175,082 now.

Delete the indicators for the 20% promotion and try the same for a 30% promotion by writing a “1” into E1067 and F1068:F10670. Overall revenue for December would be now $177,291. Not much of a difference but still it is better to go with a 30% promotion.

That’s it, we are done! We are now able to answer all of our initial questions: We know what revenue impact the promotions have respectively and which promotion we should run during Christmas time

## Limitations

You might wonder, why we did not solve the problem with a regression analysis tool. The answer to this is actually quite simple:

For a regression analysis with a typical spreadsheet analysis add-on the dependent variable would have been revenue. In addition we would have needed 25 independent variables to account for the different factors (months, day of the week, promotions, Black Friday, Christmas, after event days).

Most analysis add-ons simply can’t handle that many independent variables (including the Excel Analysis ToolPak, which can handle up to 15 independent variables). That’s why we use the Solver, which allows a lot more changing cells) to estimate the coefficients of the independent variables in order to minimize the sum of squared errors.

In addition as with all models above created model is only a simplification of reality and can never give a 100% accurate forecast. Furthermore in this case the revenue numbers were simplified as well. As such revenue growth wasn’t included. In addition events and after event days were very easily identifiable and could be clearly distinguished from normal days. As mentioned this might be more difficult for a real life data sets.

Nevertheless the above guide provides a good basis to develop your own forecasting models and to fit a model to your revenue data and events. So next step for you is to fit it to your own data set and to predict if promotions for Christmas will make sense for you!",4,34,2018-12-13,ECOM,0.06099229554335276,0.9039786259333292,0.03502904251217842
dropship,"""Drop Surfing"" - A new buzzword you shouldn't fall for","So apparently a lot of outdated drop shipping courses are going stale and the general impression among average newbies seems to be that most courses are useless. So what do these course creators do? Coin bullshit terms to make everything that was old and outdated new again. Got to read about it for the first time [here](https://www.withintheflow.com/drop-surfing/): 

&gt; Drop surfing is a relatively new term that has picked up some steam. It’s supposed to be a new way of doing dropshipping where you get to enjoy the best prices on trending products.

&gt; It’s pretty much like surfing on a wave of suppliers where you go from one supplier to another to get the best prices on the products.

&gt; Simply put,

&gt; If you are selling a product, but there are 5 different suppliers (with top-ratings) that provide the same product then you will often opt for the supplier with the cheapest prices to maximize your profits. However, once that supplier increases their prices, you will head over to the next supplier that provides the cheaper price.

So basically it boils down to having multiple suppliers that can provide lower-priced products in a niche... But isn't that supposed to be the STANDARD for smart drop shipping anyway?",5,16,2018-12-13,ECOM,0.061209410429000854,0.895411491394043,0.043379101902246475

dropship,I made $100 in my first two weeks - here's how I did it,"Hey everyone, I've been following this subreddit for a while and have learned so much from everyone here - thanks for the inspiration.

I posted about my new store Bamboo Abode back in July when it launched, but wanted to go deeper into how I had a successful first two weeks right out of the gate.

I wanted to share how I was able to get a new idea off the ground pretty quickly and have relative success with it.

I'd wanted to try my hand at e-commerce for a couple of years, but simply never found the time. I'm a social media marketer full-time and I worked with many clients where I'd optimise their store/product listings/Facebook ads, etc, and also learned heaps from Tim Ferriss and his book The 4 Hour Workweek. 

So finally back in July, I had some extra time and put my store into action. I chose a niche I was actually passionate about, with the objective of doing more than making quick money - I wanted to make it into a large and popular brand. So I created Bamboo Abode, my Shopify store selling bamboo accessories for the home, kitchen, bathroom, and office.

**Here's the website:** [https://bambooabode.com/](https://bambooabode.com/)

I'm confident that my skills in social media (and design) really helped when launching.

&amp;#x200B;

**The launch giveaway**

After designing the store, the logo, and readying products and social media accounts, my first move was to hold a launch giveaway. I chose one of my own products to give away, a bamboo mobile phone stand that was $9.99 on the store. I built a Facebook ad for this and targeted the following:

* Women
* Ages 25-34
* Interested in: Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Crate &amp; Barrel, West Elm, Home &amp; Garden, The Honest Company, and Minimalism
* Located in: UK, USA, Australia, NZ, Canada, Ireland
* Interest expansion: off
* Facebook feed only
* Optimised for Post Engagement
* $10/day for 7 days

With this ad, I had hoped to get 50 comments. After one week, I had 82 comments, 17 shares, and 166 likes!

**Here's the post:** [https://www.facebook.com/bambooabode/photos/a.281195909321377/282965019144466/?type=3&amp;theater](https://www.facebook.com/bambooabode/photos/a.281195909321377/282965019144466/?type=3&amp;theater)  


The giveaway brought a lot of attention and even repeat customers, lending to the $100 made in the first two weeks. Since that first giveaway, I've put more effort into Instagram and I'm working every day to grow the brand.

I’ve found the easiest way to do that is through a look alike optimized for conversions. I want to go over crucial details to make it as rich as possible so you can crush it.

First, you want to have profitable adsets created and milk them out till they are no longer profitable. Let’s say you have 5 adsets used from flex targeting and they are profitable. You do not want to just start a look alike around 100 orders. Max out on the adsets and milk them completely for as long as you can. If you can get 400-600 orders that is very good. 

Second, you want to focus on optimization. If you’re profiting $1 per purchase from your Facebook ads then your look alike audience is going to give you VERY similar results. It’s important to keep on testing to make sure you’re optimizing your ads for the greatest profits BEFORE scaling. 

Third, do not forget about influencer ads! I understand some products just don’t do well with influencers but it’s worth a shot. Facebook and Instagram are tied together so any data you get on Instagram will be just as valuable.

Hope this helped! Let me know if you have any questions.",6,9,2018-12-14,ECOM,0.01856914348900318,0.906677782535553,0.07475314289331436
shopify,"15% of all the packages we order, we return..","Today in the Dutch news: 15% of all the packages we order, we return. Online shopping is still gaining popularity and we order more every year. We also return more packages every year.  

These returns are often free for the consumer, but not for the shop. Web shops are therefore constantly trying new ways to improve efficiency.  

One of the solutions is Augmented Reality (AR). With AR you can view products in 3D in your living room before you order. For example, you are shopping for a new dining room table. You found a nice table online. Using your smartphone's camera, you view a 3D model of the product in AR to see what it looks like. Too big? too small? Or just right? With AR consumers can view products in their home before they buy. This results in more confidence and fewer returns.  

Would you use AR before making a purchase?  Would you use it for your webshop to reduce returns?",6,7,2018-12-14,ECOM,0.019688328728079796,0.8423423767089844,0.13796935975551605

woocommerce,How To Correctly Show Variable Prices &amp; Images in Variable Products?,"Hello all,

I am going to attempt to explain my issue as clearly as possible I apologise if it is not. For context my Ecommerce store sells clothing, available in different sizes &amp; colours. For larger sizes they are more expensive as they require more fabric to make.

My theme has recently provided variation galleries as an option for variable products. Lovely, this means instead of having a bunch of simple products pointing to long url’s of different colour variations, I can group different colours together into one url and have galleries load for those colours. Generate unique content for one page instead of duplicate content across multiple pages = much better for SEO.

Let me put forward this example of what I want, and the problem I am having.

If I sell a T-Shirt,

Available in sizes: Small – Medium at €10, and Large at €15

Available in colours: Red, Blue

When the user clicks the different colours it loads a gallery of the correct photos.

So if a user clicks small &amp; red, a gallery of just red t-shirts will load. If they click medium &amp; red, the SAME gallery of red t-shirts will load. Not another gallery of the same photos, this avoids needing to add a lot of the same photos to every single product variation, thus dramatically increasing page load time for users.

I have tried many combinations on the backend, and I have noticed that changing the order of the variations changes the function on the frontend. So whichever variation is first on the list has the highest priority and prevents other variations from working.

For example a t-shirt available in red &amp; blue, sizes Small (€10), Medium (€10), Large (€15).
I have my variations setup as follows:

Variation 1: Any Size -&gt; Red -&gt; Gallery of Red t-shirts -&gt; €10
Variation 2: Any Size -&gt; Blue -&gt; Gallery of Blue t-shirts -&gt; €10
Variation 3: Large -&gt; Any colour -&gt; No Images (as they are loaded from previous variations) -&gt; €15

But what is happening is the images load for the correct attributes but the price doesn’t change for the large, as the the variations above it have a higher priority, and a fixed price of €10.

Is there a specific way I can order my variations to achieve the desired effect? Do I need to add a specific hook so that any time the attribute “red” is clicked the same gallery of photos is used no matter what?

I appreciate any help on this matter,

Regards,

Taidgh",2,7,2018-12-16,ECOM,0.06432243436574936,0.9009528756141663,0.03472469747066498

shopify,We speed tested 400 Shopify stores and found some cool stuff. I thought you guys may find it useful too.,"Hey guys, we tested the speed of a sample of 400 Shopify stores and found some pretty interesting things. I thought the data would be useful to more people so I wanted to share it with you guys here!

Speed makes a huge difference to bounce rates, conversions and SEO. If that's stuff you're focusing on now, you may find this interesting:

# The median Shopify store takes 22 seconds to become reliably usable

When testing Time to Interactive, the time it takes for all the initial JS to load and for the site to become reliably usable, we found that the median store takes a whopping 22 seconds.'

This is pretty significant compared to the 12 seconds that Amazon takes and the 9.5 seconds that eBay takes.

Your site may feel faster than that because First Meaningful Paint - the time it takes for the important visible parts to load - is much faster.

For the median Shopify store, this takes 4.9 seconds. That's compared to 3.6 seconds for Amazon and 2.7 seconds for eBay.

# 71.4% of stores are unnecessarily bogged down on mobile

One of the biggest issues we saw is sites trying to load desktop-sized images on mobile. Shopify's templating system allows for multiple sizes of images to be served but only 38.6% of stores take advantage of this.

The average savings in site size that a store can achieve is 529.9kb if they start serving correctly sized images on mobile.

# Shopify stores can get major speed gains by removing render-blocking resources

The average Shopify store can shave 1230ms off rendering times by removing or deferring render blocking resources.

These are CSS and JS assets that block the loading of the web page. Extracting the essential parts and only loading those first can make a site feel super fast.

dropship,How to succeed in Dropshipping!,"😢😓It is really Sad seeing everyone trying to convince people that dropshipping is super easy and that anyone can simply succeed with it!😢😓

After years of working online, I can recall all times I succeeded but believe me I can not remember how many times I failed! because it happened many and many times and I am quite sure it will happen again in the future...😜😂

💪💪We learn from our mistakes and failures to build our future success!💪💪

Building an online business and profiting from it, is not easy! it needs time, effort, courage, hard work, and dedication!  
If you want really to earn your living online and let's start with this realistic goal (before jumping to the 7 figures and 6 figures dreams), you should be very serious about your work and how to deal with it...

Don't be fooled... by the big numbers because most probably they are fake!🤕🤕

So before starting with any of your projects, sit down and ask yourself if you are well prepared and if you are ready to lose and fail.. because failures will come first. so ask yourself are you strong enough to withstand them?💆💆‍♂️

I am not saying don't invest and don't take risks, in reverse! without investing and taking risks you will never try and you will never succeed! 🎆🎇🎉🎊

However, you should start the right way:

⏩1- Strat by learning how to build your own store... you don't want anyone to build your store... It is better to do it yourself so you will be able to always modify and tune your stores.

⏩2- Learn how to create your brand and make it look professional

⏩3- Learn how to do marketing and copyrighting. Learn how to write your adds and your product description. How to use upsells, cross-sells and FBT to increase your sales

⏩4- Learn how to design your product Images and how to produce a video ad of your product ( video ads are very powerful!)

dropship,Challenge with Suppliers and Alibaba,"Hi all, I’m new to this subreddit and to dropshipping and I’ve hit a roadblock in getting my store started. I’ve developed a brand idea based on a niche that I’m passionate about but I’m finding it a real challenge to find suppliers. Let me explain...

I created a list of approximately 70 products I’d like to sell, 30 of those I managed to find on Aliexpress (all from different suppliers) and of the remaining 40 a large portion will require logo customisation/ print on demand. 

I’ve been searching Alibaba for the remaining 40 products and unfortunately many of them have a high MOQ, and they’re all coming from different sources. I’m yet to even contact them as to whether they’ll hold my inventory and fulfil orders...

The frustrating thing here is that based off my search on Alibaba, I’ll need a fair amount capital to get this going, which I’m not prepared to do given I’m novice. And the other issue is that all my products are coming from different sources so all multiple item orders will arrive in several packages...

I feel like my issue isn’t one of up front investment or dispersed suppliers but is rather my inadequacy of finding suppliers. Is there perhaps a dropship agency that can find Chinese suppliers for me? I’m finding that manually searching Alibaba and Aliexpress just isn’t getting me the result I want... if anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it.

dropship,How to be intelligent about dropshipping?,"I have been trying to get into dropshipping in the past two months, mainly after attending an event when I met a lot of people doing so (from people breaking even, to making profit, to those making huge profits). I watched many videos on youtube, and tried 3 products/facebook compaigns so far (i'll probably make a post to get your opinion on my listing/product choices).

I got into the dropshipping space in the really traditional fashion, and I have no marketing experience, so I'm just trying to find winning products, listing them on my shopify store, and running an ad compaign on fb ads (10 adsets * 7.5$ daily budget for a day or two) and I still haven't got any sale through these (just one from spamming in fb groups).

So I'm really wondering is there something that all those youtube/udemy tutorials are missing? Is it a game of just trying a lot of products till you find a winning one by advertising it on fb ads? Or should one try a different angle, like making promotions through blog posts or video content? 

My objective right now is really to learn and start breaking-even/start making small profits.",12,23,2018-12-18,ECOM,0.040966376662254333,0.9282740950584412,0.03075946494936943

I see people on amazon selling this product for $16 but alternatively I see people selling it for $5 with shipping fees of around $5. Even if someone was to see the product presented to them as $5, they would probably still leave my site to go there right?

ecommerce,Is copy more important than visual design?,"So I was having an interesting philosophical debate regarding e-commerce (boredom and spare time on discord). I feel copywriting is an important part of this industry, however so is design.

My take on this is that copy is essential to selling but so is visual design. In fact, I think copy may be a form of design.. ""persuasive design"" if you might say. Visual design seems to play a key role in building trust which makes people more susceptible to good copy. I tend not to trust badly designed things unless when buying things I need or want badly.

When it comes to advertising, people get drawn in either by the initial few words or images.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this matter? Probably not. It would possibly also depend on the type of store you run.

But the things that confuses me are things like ads to drive traffic, how to make the site look a little better. I cant seem to find a view all button other than the one provided at the top left of the screen on the 3 lines mark, maybe im just using a bad theme,

The problem is that these items are sometimes very large, have to be extensively setup, and are basically a giant pain to photograph.

Because I'm not going to just throw up some half ass snap, and doing it right is a big deal. So I've considered using basic 3D illustrations on the site.

shopify,Suggestion to get more customer insights,"Hi you guys,

I would like to share a quite unique app that could probably help you with collecting customer insights and attributes.

It's called Customer cart &amp; attribute, you can add unlimited numbers of fields to registration, account page and cart page. It's like a small survey to get to know more about your buyers ( the fields could be formed as Text Field, Select box, dropdown, multiple select...) and customers can edit their information anytime.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you get the insights, you can reduce marketing cost by aiming the correct audience, launch remarketing campaign with higher success percentage.

The app DOES provide free templates such as age, gender, country, approach channel, interest,... or you can create your very own.

Try the app to experience the unique features and see how it gonna help your business in long-term.

*Stealing a successful business idea (eg. product)

Pros: Quick buck, less retargeting/spending on ads on the wrong audience, possible to so better than the one you took it from, modify currently ads to get better rather than make my own 

Cons: Short term gain (trend might be dying), possible to get sued?, less potential value gain (since there are two companies competing for sales), less margin for sales than competitor


*Finding my own trending product

Pros: Monopoly on the product (if im the only one selling it), potential value much higher, I can set my own profit margin, branding of the product gets easier

Cons: More audience research, much more money spent on ads/retargeting, product might not catch a trend that will bring customers (dead product), have to make my own ads that require a lot of creativity, time and money.

I ended abusing alcohol very heavily become totally irresponsible. Currently, I'm homeless and have $40 to my name (sleeping on pallets and a yoga mat in a friends spare room) and have no income. But I've finally emerged from my habits of negative thinking, depression and I'm in a much more stable place mentally. 

I no longer hate myself,  I'm now in a situation where I need to turn my life around and quickly. I need to earn $2,000 within 2 weeks to secure an apartment.

* Content creation (award winning essayist and former quora top writer). 
* Shopify store design and implementation (Shopify partner, built and developed brands for over 100 stores). 
* FB Ad design, strategy and implementation (Ran ads peaking generating up to $3,500 per day in revenue)
* Google ads, copywriting, strategy, keyword research, competitive research (Ran campaigns reaching $700 per day revenue in a couple of days). 
* Dropshipping niche analysis and selection (I've got a sheet with dozens of highly promising google keywords for dropshipping stores, with large profit potential). 
* Premium Shopify themes, logo templates and a few other assets that I can bring to bear on a project. 
* Consulted with many different clients including software companies, ecommerce clients and educational developers regarding growth and marketing strategy.

dropship,Aliexpress declined the refund :(,"I want to share my experience with everyone that is dropshipping regarding a dispute I placed in Aliexpress. I hope this experience helps others to make us better dropshippers.

This is what happened: 

I'm pissed with Aliexpress ""Buyer Protection"" program. I lost money because an Aliexpress supplier did not ship the order on time. The order was placed on Dec 1, 2018, and it was shipped LATE. The seller had a 5-day processing time. On Dec 5th I asked the seller ""where is my package?"" but the seller did not answer. I asked them again on the following 2 days and still no answers. So on Dec 8th, I order the product from another seller and then cancel this order. Just before canceling, the seller shipped it. So they shipped it 2 days after the end of the processing time.

Aliexpress Response: We're really sorry for what has happened and we totally understand your feeling. As the shipping information indicates the package has been delivered and you didn't provide us with the valid evidence to prove you haven't received the package within the limit days, we assume you have received the package and we will release the full payment to the **seller** according to our rule.

-
So I did not get my refund. But I believe that if suppliers have a ""processing time"", and they do not ship in that time, AliExpress should be responsible and must refund the money.

Now, because I ordered it twice my customer got two packages with the same product. That is not good branding for my store, it makes us seem unprofessional, but it's not a huge problem either. Also, my customer received the product late, which is bad.

My learnings from this experience are:

(1) cancel an order BEFORE placing a new one. Oups, this was my big mistake. 

(2) And it's very important to set up a relationship with the supplier BEFORE starting to place orders. Now I'm using WeChat to have a direct way of communicating with my suppliers.

dropship,Alternatives for AliExpress? Trustworthy suppliers,Are there any other platforms besides AliExpress for dropshipping (with shopify) ?

dropship,"If I want to ship worldwide through Aliexpress, should I say that additional shipping prices and shipping times may apply?","I am new to dropshipping so I am skeptical with starting my first store.

I would prefer to ship with epacket but it is not supported with all countries.  What should I put in the shipping description to ensure that customers know that if epacket is not supported in their country, that additional shipping charges will apply and may take longer? I would like to say that most items will ship within the 12-20 days that most epacket suppliers provide.

It seems as though even Canada is not using epacket at this time... but this may be due to the strikes and the back logs.",3,3,2018-12-30,ECOM,0.02368406020104885,0.915197491645813,0.06111842393875122

ecommerce,Seriously considering a new e-commerce CMS (currently on Wordpress + Woo commerce),"Hi everyone we are thinking of changing from Wordpress to some other CMS solution. Our website currently has a blog and a large store with over 100 products. What's your thoughts, should we check out Shopify.

ecommerce,Check your funnels and Ads!!!!,"Take all of this with a grain of salt. Don’t over obsess over it, just make sure you’re doing it periodically and when necessary.

Every time you launch ads in a different region, hop on a VPN in your most common device and just go ahead and send her over. This goes along with testing your different funnels as well. 

I obviously don’t have to say test ad copies/creatives and such but here’s something stupid that happened to me that you’d consider obvious:

Today I launched a free shipping offer for UK based countries to launch into that market (a few days) and the ONEEEEE job I had was to make sure free shipping was up....nope. Had great great quality results BESIDES purchases. Luckily it was only 2 $13 Ads. Support had to notify me that they were getting pinged about not seeing Free Shipping.",1,5,2018-12-31,ECOM,0.019360648468136787,0.89054274559021,0.09009656310081482

woocommerce,Replace Product Page with Lightbox?,"Hello,

I am a landscape photographer, looking for a way to allow my customers to easily scroll through my print offerings lightbox style, and easily add a desired print to the cart immediately from that same view.

&amp;#x200B;

A good comparison would be Facebook:

* Click an image to open it up larger
* You can scroll back and forth through the whole album
* On the right - instead of comments or ""likes"", to have the option of selecting a desired print size and an ""add-to-cart"" button.

Here's the gist of my hopes:

[https://imgur.com/a/dPLAI0a](https://imgur.com/a/dPLAI0a)

The whole ""click an image -&gt; product page -&gt; back arrow -&gt; next image -&gt; product page"" strategy is far too clunky. I'm used to having a portfolio where you simply look at the images in the gallery, now I wish I could add the WooCommerce functionality to it. Plugin recommendations, code ideas, themes, anything is welcome so long as it helps me SKIP THE PRODUCT PAGE entirely, and allow my customers to flow through my galleries and add to the cart as their hearts (hopefully) desire.

&amp;#x200B;

I do already know how to add sizes and materials to my products, so that's a non issue. This question is purely on presentation.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very kindly for your assistance! Regards,
