shopify,I am new to Shopify! Would love some input.,"I opened my shopify store a few months ago. www.collectedvillage.com. My mission is to empower women through our brand. Starting from buying products from women makers all over the world to selling to women that just need a stunning accessory to conquer the world. 

A couple of facts - 
- There are a couple of items I buy from China and others handmade in Colombia. My goal in 2019 is to get to buy products only from women makers.
- The items that are made in Colombia (one of a kind collection) I can only get one of. If I get some traction I could travel and get larger quantities. 
- I have only made a couple of sales. None from the website. 
- I tried advertising, but I might be doing something wrong. No sales from my ads.
- I have been focusing my time on growing my Instagram following. One sale from Instagram :(

Looking forward to your input.

Seems like I would need a different url for each category + seperate shopify acc to do product testing in different cats? Any advice to keep it lean in the begining? Its like the ability to pivot from say a toilet seat to a dog bowl etc, if that makes sense?

shopify,Need a better Shopify + Slack app? Try out the beta for my 1st app.,"**TL;DR** - I just finished developing my first Shopify app--Shoppy, a free app that gives you updates about orders sent directly to Slack and you can even upgrade to Elite and get daily, weekly, or monthly order summaries to make reporting easier. Join the beta here: https://shoppy.emerald.io. Any feedback you have is appreciated since this is my first app! 

---
**Long version**:

Hi everyone -

I've been using Shopify for 2 years as a marketer and ecommerce manager, and I've sold &gt;$500k worth of product in 2018. But, we use Slack, and I've always wanted a Shopify app that sent order notifications for new, refunded, and fulfilled orders to Slack but I also wanted this app to include discount codes used, tags, and UTM tracking for the order so I know what's working and what's not. I tried every app I could find, and nothing had this level of tracking in their Slack notifications. 

So, I decided to learn to code and make an app myself.

Shoppy connects your Shopify store with Slack so you can receive important order notifications and summaries sent straight to Slack, reducing the amount of time you spend pulling order data and giving you more time to focus on growing your store. And, because I wanted to solve my own problem, Shoppy is the only app that includes discount codes used, tags, and Google Analytics/UTM associated with our orders. You can also receive daily, weekly, and monthly summaries that include order counts and revenue for that date range, and I'm working on automating these summaries for a future update. 

I just submitted the app to Shopify for review, but I'm looking for beta users to try Shoppy out and provide feedback. I've also included 7-day trials for the Premium and Elite tiers so you can try them out completely for free and you can cancel any time. 

If you're interested, here's a link to install the app: https://shoppy.emerald.io

And, if you have any questions/feedback about Shoppy or if I can help answer any marketing or ecommerce questions about your Shopify store, please comment below!

dropship,Dropshipping results from Nov 2018 - Jan 3 2019,"I started researching dropshipping in Oct 2018.  Went through a few dud products, finally found one, and today I have crossed the $3k milestone in revenue with a 40% profit margin.  I really can't believe it.  I had started to think that either dropshipping was dead or the whole industry was pretty much a scam.  Turns out even the newbies can do it.

EDIT #1 Wow, I'm getting a lot of direct PMs on how I came up with the product.  I do have a specific technique that I came up with that i really haven't seen anyone else use.  If interested, let me know and I will post.

EDIT #2 - PLEASE don't try and sell phone accessories.  No ear buds, no phone cases, no chargers, etc.  These products are just too widely available at the local Best Buy.  ESPECIALLY if you are drop shipping from China and expecting long ship times - do not sell a product that is available at Best Buy, Wal Mart, or even on Amazon, because those stores already have u beat with their fast shipping or same day pickup.  Find something that isn't readily available (i.e., it is quite niche) and then sell the heck out of it.

shopify,Why this subreddit is awesome for Shopify entrepreneurs,"I hope this doesn't come off too mushy, but I just want to say how glad I am that this subreddit exists.

As some of you might know, I shared my first Shopify app yrecently and I wasn't sure how it would go. 

Surprisingly, it got a good amount of upvotes, but the best part was that one user on this sub installed the app, encountered a bug, and has been working with me over email to debug the issue. This user is in a completely different country (I'm based in the US), and he's been spending what little free time he has helping me figure out why the app isn't working right on his store. We're going on 10 emails back and forth, and we're still working through it together. 

As a first time developer, the ability to work with a real user and debug your code is invaluable, and it's really hard to find users who will give you their time to help you work through the issue. I'm so incredibly thankful that I found this subreddit, and I'm glad it's made up of a lot of passionate--but more importantly, helpful--entrepreneurs who are willing to help one another out.

ecommerce,Shipping costs for orders with multiple distribution centers.,"I've got a tricky one here. I have a store where the typical order might have 3 line items. Each line item being fulfilled from a separate distribution center or drop-shipper.

Calculating shipping costs has been a bear. Our platform only calculates with the assumption that the entire order is shipped from one location as one shipping event. So it sucks because we potentially lose money on the shipping costs.

I've considered rebuilding our shipping calculator so that it calculates for each shipping event on an order. The problem with that is the shipping costs will sky-rocket and our number one complaint is ALREADY shipping costs.

My hunch is to either increase the price of our product or take a hit in margin. But is there a solution that I haven't thought of? Thoughts and feedback welcomed:-)

This is despite setting up redirects from the old to the new product/collection URLs.  Needless to say, the clients were not happy.

From what I understand, when Google sees a major replatforming of a site, it tends to de-index a lot of the site's pages and then slowly reintroduce them to the index once it has gathered new data on bounce rates, site quality, etc.  I guess there's no way to avoid that entirely, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do to mitigate the effect of replatforming.  

Any suggestions?  Should I just try to set the client's expectations, and let them know there is going to be a dip but it will hopefully be temporary?

The idea is that if a user spends a lot of time on certain blog posts and then they end up purchasing a certain type of product. Because they are already in my email list I then can segment the customer to a specific email list that gets the articles they are interested in but with some product highlights that they are also interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

That is just one use case. I was wondering if any of you have thought of any others or kinda wish something existed that would allow you to track customer behavior better.

shopify,Product Research Help - Shopify Dropshipping,"I've posted about this before but I still find product research the hardest part of dropshipping by far. I have tried facebook keyword searches, ecomhunt, google trends and even hours of scrolling through aliexpress and amazon looking for something to sell.

I still feel blind when looking for products though. I've never experienced having a winner after 4 months of dropshipping and it's becoming tedious looking for products but I'm nowhere near willing to give up.

shopify,Looking for studies on the psychology of pricing.,"Hey everyone, currently on my second try at starting a Shopify store, I am specifically looking for information on using the ""striked out"" pricing on a site. Such as 25 with a line through it and then showing the real price at 15. The only thing I have found is that the consumer needs a reason for this price difference, and does not want to just see it. Something like a sale etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also read that optimally you want the least number of ""syllables"" in your prices. 1599 instead of 1,599.00.

We fulfill some of our inventory through Amazon FBA (we do both dropshipping and private label). We have it set to auto fulfill all line items, and when the line item is one of our Amazon SKUs it sends the order to Amazon.

We are able to successfully pass orders through the API to Shopify (Yay!). But the fulfillment request to Amazon keeps failing due to shipping method not being selected.

dropship,Start-Up Cost For Dropshipping: Shopify vs WordPress,"Dropshipping as always seem like a business that requires no capital to make money and I bet this as to do with its popularity. 

Two of the most famous platform out there when it comes to dropshipping is Shopify and WordPress. As awesome as both platforms are they defer in price and features. 

So, invariably your e-commerce platform is going to affect the cost of starting your dropshipping business. 

To make this as brief as possible I’m going to detailed the cost for both platforms so you can know what either is going to cost you.

Dropshipping Start-Up Cost for Shopify

* Shopify platform &amp; Hosting = $29
* Domain Name = $14
* [Oberlo App or Spocket App](https://torchbankz.com/spocket-vs-oberlo) = $29

Optional Shopify Apps for store optimization and boosting of store conversion

*  Discount pricing app: $19.99
*  Boost sales app: $30
*  Exit intent Pop up: $29
* Sale Pop-up: $0.00

Mind you the optional apps are not compulsory but very necessary. This will help with a faster return on investment. 

The last cost is going to be the **Marketing Cost**. 

For this also, there’s no stipulated price but let’s say around **$400** upward should be good for a starters. 

# Summary Cost for Shopify

* The basic cost for Shopify is going to be  $72 ($29+$14+$29)
* Optional Cost is $78.99 ( $19.99+$30+$29)
* Market cost is $400
* Total Cost For Shopify = $550

Note: Every fee on Shopify are recurring fee except for your marketing fee. So, technically you should be running close to half of the total fee on a monthly basis. 

# Dropshipping StartUp Cost for WordPress

The start cost for WordPress is rather straightforward and mostly one-time fee. That is you won’t have to deal with a monthly recurring fee. But at the same time, Shopify is usually easy to operate compared with WordPress. Let’s take a look at the cost: 

* Web Hosting = $50
* Domain Name = $10
* Dropshipping Plugin (AliDropship) = $89

Optional or additional add-ons for your website. They include: 

* Countdown timer: $29
* Recent sales Pop-up: $29
* Abandoned Cart: $0.00
* Google Merchant: $27
* Upsell: $37

Note: all the plugins are one-time fee only. Once you’ve got them you don’t have to worry about the monthly recurring fees. 

Just like Shopify, you can also go with $400 for the marketing cost for starters and later if you feel like increasing or decreasing your budget you can. 

# Summary Cost for WordPress

* Basic cost for [building a WordPress site](https://torchbankz.com/create-dropshipping-website)  = $149
* Additional cost for extra plugins (optional) = $122
* Marketing cost $400

Total cost for WordPress = $671

dropship,Premature Store Optimization Will Kill You,"I've seen a lot of people in this forum asking for reviews of their dropshipping store and I've seen a lot of answers that, frankly, are misguided.  I wanted to take a minute to explain why these answers are misguided (well intended, but misguided) and how following some of this advice will likely end in a failed store.

The typical post starts out something like this: ""I'm just getting started with dropshipping and I'd like some reviews of my store before I start paying for ads.""  A legit request, but then you get answers like these:
- change your theme color to a darker blue
- change the button text on your 'add to cart' button
- change the colors in your logo
- etc, etc

Frankly, these types of actions are simply meaningless in the grand scheme of trying to build a profitable store.  If you've done your job finding the right product for the right customer, the fact that your theme colors are not the right shade of blue will have no bearing whatsoever on the customer's decision to purchase your product.  But even worse, taking all of these miniscule actions to polish themes and change colors and change buttons to have rounded corners will simply zap any energy you have.  You'll be so tired from making all of these petty changes that aren't going to make a difference that you won't be able to focus on the real challenges you are facing with your store.  And it will all end in a failing store and you saying ""but I tried everything.""  Turns out you tried everything **that didn't matter**.

To be clear, I'm not saying you never need to think about theme colors or button text, but there is a proper time for that type of store optimization, and it is certainly **not** before you launch.  Once you have a profitable store up and running, THEN you can start thinking about how to optimize the look &amp; feel of your store.

Ok, so for those folks who don't believe me - consider this.  Has there ever been a time in your life when you visited a retail brick and mortar store, fell in love with their products, but you walked out because you didn't like their logo?  Or you walked out because you didn't like the paint color on the walls?  Or you walked out because the carts were too small or the bathrooms were in the back of the store instead of the front?  Uh, no.  So, please, focus on product-market fit, finding a way to get the perfect product in front of the perfect customer so you can make some money.  Don't waste your time prematurely optimizing the look &amp; feel of your store when you haven't even made one sale yet.",18,35,2019-01-06,ECOM,0.02996331825852394,0.9290590286254883,0.04097767919301987

* **Lots of traffic, but no clicks** - put effort into refining your ads targeting &amp; ad creative.  Most likely you are sending the wrong message to the wrong people.

* **Lots of clicks, but no add-to-carts** - put effort into writing better product descriptions, lowering your prices, or updating your product catalog images.  The ad obviously worked to get them to your site, but then something about your site turned them off and made them say 'nah'. 	
					
* **Lots of add to carts, but no purchases** - put effort into lowering/refining your shipping costs, making your site more trustworthy &amp; credible, ensuring your discounts &amp; promotions are working, and making sure your payment funnel is actually working and you can accept payments for sales.

dropship,How To Test Shopify Drop shipping Products,"A lot of newbies always come up with this question often time and I thought of coming up with a simple step by step process on how to test dropshipping products.

I will start by listing the platforms and what you need. This methods are all dependent on how much you are willing to spend for ads and research.

Instagram: 
Quality of content, presentation, packaging, attractive, graphics.... Mention legitimate statistics and show the solution 

Create 2 shutouts with 2 separate pages. 2 posts, 1 on each page. 

The 2 posts are going to be different with different picture(copy) ad copy and different emojis.

#tag as many relevant words that are related to your niche. E.g. #fitness, #walkout #gym if you got a niche related to it. You can look up cities on Google trend and see where these topics are trending and #tag those cities and events that are happening there.. like games e.g. #cowboys, #goldenstate ETC.

Budget: $7/day

Facebook:
1 campaign. 3 ad sets 

Cast a wide net... that way you can capture a wide range of data, age, gender... platform and device.

Target the audience that is interested in what you are selling. You cannot expect to make sales to an audience that is not interest in your product. 

Build one more campaign that makes money $$$

When you get the data, use the data and your target audience after you decide your winning product. 


Repeat ads that are most successful after the first attempt  and retarget your audience base on the data you got. The audience is key. If you can't convert it to get sales, then go back and see where you missing it. 

Look out for your top 3 competitors and see what they are doing differently. Check their fan page/followers. Study the flow/trend and what their followers are responding to mostly. Look at their key phrases, style and emulate. Most of the time they are far and better ahead than you in terms of ads and they got the money to spend.. 

Go to their Facebook audience insight and you will see all the people following them. You can see their age, location and interest. Retarget Retarget and Retarget. 

How much data you are able to get for the right audience is relatively proportional to the traffic and sales you are able to generate. 

Once you get your winning product, then you can go for sales and scale for more conversions. 

If you are scared of testing a product, you can watch out for a trending product. Go to aliexpress and find out the sales and reviews. Check it out on Amazon and eBay... get the statistics and grab a sales from that same product by listing it on your store. Get a couple of friends and tell them to write a review on this winning product on your store page and ask them to mention you on competitors Instagram or facebook pages where those products are being sold. E.g I found this this hairdryer on xyz.com at a good price.

Wishing you all the best. There are loads of capable hands and smart folks here on Reddit. Ask ask ask. You will be surprise what you going to see.

dropship,Don't Launch your store before doing the following!,"I am really choked of the stores some people share asking for review... I feel truly sad because some stores don't even have the minimum required...They don't look professional at all!

Optimizing a store to be able to sell is something super important.. people don't pay money online unless they are convinced! Unless they feel secured!

So a store that doesn't look professional is a store doomed to fail! TRUST is the key point! People don't put their credit card information if the store doesn't look credible!

shopify,Who should I hire for Shopify marketing? Fiverr?,"Hi,

A little bit of background on what our products are about. Me and my wife sale enamel pins or sometimes called lapel pins. We are big movie buffs, and create original designed pins inspired by our favorite movies. 

The pins are made in china and shipped to us. We package them nicely and send them out once we get orders. Most of our sales come from etsy, and barely any sales are generated from shopify. I try to be active with our instagram, we have an ok amount of traffic there but they dont convert to many sales.

I would like someone to help rank our website higher on google, and somehow target people to get more traffic/sales. I was hoping to maybe hire someone on fiverr because I have no idea what I am doing when it comes to website marketing. But it's hard to know who to trust, and how much to spend. We are very small so I don't want to spend much money until I know that its worth it. Also everyone on fiverr seems to have perfect ""review"" (no telling which are from real people that actually got what they ordered).

shopify,Three biggest mistakes in e-commerce campaigns and how to solve it,"**You probably have read many guides on how to run campaigns for your e-commerce store and I don’t want to take another hour or two of your time.**

**In less than 5 minutes you will know what type of campaigns you need to run to grow sales in your store! Not doing these campaigns is one of the most popular mistakes.**

**I sort these campaigns by the revenue they could generate. So if you want to start – start from the top one**

**1. Remarketing campaigns**

A visitor comes to your site, learn about your products but leave before purchasing. Remarketing campaign displays your ads on sites &amp; apps they visit later, bringing them back and keeping your brand top-of-mind.

**Why it’s important?** 

* you have already paid for the acquisition
* those people already know your brand
* a little trust is build
* could be ready for purchase but something occurred during checkout (abandoned checkout recovery)

**How to set it up in Facebook Business Manager?**

1. Create a custom audience based on traffic or engagement
2. Create a new campaign “catalog sales” 
3. Create a separated ad set for each stage of the funnel. Those are top 6 audiences where you can easily get extra sales.
   1. Visited website but didn’t purchase
   2. View content (every page with Call To Action) but didn’t purchase
   3. Added to cart but didn’t purchase
   4. Engaged with videos
   5. Engaged with Instagram
   6. Engaged with Facebook
4. Use different copy based on the place of the funnel. Try to give good incentive (as a discount or free shipping) for people who added to cart but didn’t purchase.
5. Test different creative – single image ads, carousel ads, video ads to see which creative works best for your business.
6. Doing it this way you’re going to show products which visitors saw on your website. 
7. Pro tip: try to do this campaign with Traffic objective. 
8. Facebook Prospecting ads Facebook Remarketing Ads Facebook Cross-sell / up-sell ads Google Prospecting ads Google Remarketing Ads Google Cross-sell / up-sell ads Shopify Theme Customization Shopify Theme Optimization Stores' Translation

**2. Prospecting campaigns**

The goal of this campaign is to get new visitors to your website. You constantly need new people floating to your store – that's why you have to have prospecting campaigns in place

**Why it’s important?** 

You know that the remarketing campaign is this campaign which makes you money. But you also know that you need a constant flow of new people to your website to have a remarketing bucket full of potential customers. There are many challenges you’re going to face doing prospecting campaigns. What type of campaign you should run, what type of objective do you want to promote, what about audiences, creative, copy? Let me help you with it.

**How to set it up in Facebook Business Manager?**

1. Use Facebook Audience Insights to know your customers better. AI (Audience Insights) will show you who your customers are – they occupation, age, gender, websites they like. 
2. Create Lookalike audiences based on previous events like Purchase, add to cart, initiate checkout, content view (+ content view at least 2 times), top 25% time spent on the website)
3. Create a new prospecting campaign. What type of objective should you select? Test it! Three main objectives to test: website conversion, traffic, catalog sales.
4. Try to play with the manual bid to bully your competitors. If your average cost per event (like Purchase, landing page view etc) is 10$ – try with the double or triple amount (20 or 30$).
5. Creative: start with something simple but don’t miss the video ads. Even simple slideshow video is better than no video.
6. Copy: as above – start with something simple. You can always base copy on this article: 10 Best Copywriting Formulas.
7. Plan experiment, write it down, run, analyze, optimize, test again. It might take you some time to find a good audience, creative &amp; copy but when you’ll find it – scaling your Facebook Ads going to be much more effective.

**3. Engagement campaigns**

All ads in PPE (Post Per Engagement) campaign help me to find a good copy, good creative, good audiences and get good engagement on ads. How you can lower your cost of advertising it in a few simple steps? Let me show you.

**Why it’s important?** 

The old and simple rules say: if you want to have cheap advertising – make your ads popular. But how to do it? You can either create viral videos or run a dedicated campaign to get engagement on ads. I like to call it “bucket of ads”. 

**How to set it up in Facebook Business Manager?**

1. Start a new campaign, as objective choose Post Per Engagement (PPE)
2. Optimize for video views
3. In each ad set test three ads (one video, one single image, and one carousel). 
4. Each ad set it’s a new, individual audience. 
5. You don’t need a high budget – a few dollars a day are enough to determine if the audience is interested in your product. 
6. Put more money behind the audience with the highest number of clicks and engagement. Stop those which performs badly. 
7. Copy ID of the ad and put it in other campaigns – that’s how you can start the fresh campaign but with an ad which has good engagement.

dropship,How Do You Know If You Have A Winning Product?,"When I first started dropshipping, the most mysterious thing to me that no one seemed to explain was how to identify when I had found a winning product.  It was easy when there were no sales...obviously, no winning product yet.  But then when I started to get like 3 or 4 sales, I started wondering ""is THIS the winning product?  Exactly how would I know if had found a winner""?

Fortunately, I did find my winning product(s) and now I have a simple formula for identifying them and not being fooled by products that have a few sales vs. products that are real winners. 

Characteristics of a winning product:

*There is enough product inventory to be able to scale it and offer it to a larger target market.
*You have at least 3 successful sales where the price is 3 times the aliexpress cost.
*Revenue is 3 times ad spend.

Example:
*Product x has 5000 in stock &amp; available  
*Product x costs $10 to source from aliexpress and you have  sold it 3 times in the past 3 days for $30 each  
*Product x has an ad spend of $10, i.e., it cost you $10 to acquire each customer via ads

Winning product formula:
Revenue - cost - ad spend
$90 - $30 - $30 = *$30 profit*

Example of a NON winning product: 
*Product x has 5000 in stock &amp; available  
*Product x costs $10 to source from aliexpress and you have  sold it 1 time in the past 3 days for $30   
*Product x has an ad spend of $30, i.e., it cost you $30 to acquire the customer via ads

Revenue - cost - ad spend
$30 - $10 - $30 = *$10 LOSS*

The main idea here is not to be fooled by a couple of random sales.  Always keep your eye on how much your ad spend is costing you compared to your revenue.

PS:  If you've had zero sales in 3 days, I'd kill the ad and move on.",12,5,2019-01-09,ECOM,0.030486926436424255,0.9320382475852966,0.037474874407052994

ecommerce,Stock System to Manage Products on Ebay/Woo/Amazon,"Currently looking at Orderhive or VeeQO to manage our eBay/Amazon and WooCommerce shop fronts. Rather than updating products on WooCommerce and then pushing the changes back and forth between eBay and Amazon (needs a plugin, less secure, reliable etc), I'd rather go one level up and manage it all via a single third-party.  


**Must be:**

* Update prices, availability, titles, descriptions from the third-party  

* Must update the above back and forth between all the shop fronts  

* Ability to automatically input new products/available stock via a scanner. For instance, new product arrives, you scan it with your device and then it automatically updates the central SaaS. This will reduce the manual labour needing to input/update new/old products.

ecommerce,"""Hobby"" ecommerce to help out my old company. How to protect myself?","tl:dr - Designed a card game for my old company. Want to set up a simple online (and at event) sales for them. Not looking to make money off it, but want to protect myself (insulate from the company and make sure I'm covered with the tax-man.)  


**Background**

I was working for a software startup and designed a card deck to assist in sales and for teaching our solution. We were using digital print on demand to make the cards and they were pricey ($28 a deck!). With shipping from China, they were like $32 a deck.  Whenever we demo the product and the decks, people want the cards. A large university even bought 60 decks to use in one of their Master's classes. People started asking for them, so we just linked out to the on demand print service to sell them.

We've sold maybe 120 decks since July 2018. So not wildly crazy, but this is all organic sales as we're not promoting them. It's a buried link on our site.

Even though I moved on to a more stable job, I've been advising and supporting the startup.

Then we got invited to present our deck at a MAJOR national conference in March, so the company put down the $1400ish to order 500 decks, which are coming to my house! So I guess this is happening!?

Per deck cost is now only about $2.80 now, which means I can set the price point low enough to make them really affordable and the company can pass them out like candy at events.

With the POD option, we aren't getting any information on the buyers any way and of course we want to use this as a lead generation, so I recommended we set up a simple WooCommerce or something and I manage the distribution.

I drive right past USPS on my way to my day job, so it's really not a big deal. The company has already paid for the cards. I will only have to manage the distribution and the shop page (I still retain control of the website until they replace me).

I've set up a WooCommerce product page on the site and am familiarizing myself with that. I've selected Square for the processing as I can carry the dongle around and maybe sell these if I'm at an event. (any better suggestions, I'm open, but it has to be simple.)

This will in no way be anything more than a hobby business or generate significant income. If it breaks even, I'm happy to support them as it's really just lead generation for them and I designed the cards and want to see them in the wild.

**Enough background, My questions:**

1) What's my best option to insulate myself against the company financially? I will write up some sort of agreement that I am operating this as an independent contractor. No money will pass between us. I will likely set up a separate bank account to handle the Square transactions and also set up a debit card to manage the incidental costs (postage processing via WooCommerce Shipping). I don't want anyone to come after my personal accounts if anything happens with the company.

2) Are there specific references for hobby ecommerce? I wouldn't know the first thing about taxes and what-not for this.  But realistically, I'll be lucky if this amounts to more than $2000 this year. Do I even collect sales tax?

shopify,Cashier put an order under a wrong account name/email... can it be fixed without canceling the initial order?,"I have an offsite event and my cashiers are taking payments.   It is important that a name be associated with all of these orders, especially if they are taking cash.  So I have asked the cashiers to either find the customer's names in the database or add them as a new customer.

  
There was a customer that had a language barrier with the cashier and she pointed to someone else with the same first name as if it was her information.  It was not, it was someone else's.  The payment was made and of course the wrong customer gets a receipt for $300.  and, as any one would freaks out.

shopify,Homewares Store - Making AdWords work help,"Hi everyone,  


I've posted a few times here - Been absolutely phenomenal help so far.  


I've now made a few sales and am trying to make those sales repeatable. I'm selling homewares at this domain, [https://yellowelement.com.au/](https://yellowelement.com.au/) .  


I'm currently using google adwords as a channel as well as google shopping adverts. I originally used adwords and was able to drive 40 cents clicks under dinnerware and dinner sets etc, but have yet to make a purchase by using these keywords ( spent about 140$). I get decent quality scores for ad copy but low for the landing page generally. I use the landing page of a collection not the home page, as I want to make sure I have the right words and get people closer towards a buy in my funnel, I think landing page might be the next thing I check but I'm unsure.

&amp;#x200B;

However by using google shopping adds with around 50$ paid I've made 260$ in sales (so it's been profitable). Originally I tested this with a lot of items in my store and found it hard to change things or optimize things, it listed all my variants separately, so I decided to remove things that weren't getting as many impressions and just focus on the dinnerware sets. I definitely get more traction from this channel but it's not really repeatable and the cost per click is over $1 and I'm not sure how to optimize it as a traction channel to reduce the cost per click (it's pretty expensive). Also as it targets multiple different items I don't know exactly how to get multiple purchases from one item to really knuckle down my CAC for items and know where to put my money.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't moved onto retargetting traffic with Facebook which is my next move, and I'm also considering targetting blogs in my niche.

The question I have is - Does anyone have any tips for optimizing google shopping adverts and for making sales on my adwords adverts?",3,5,2019-01-12,ECOM,0.028542298823595047,0.935897171497345,0.03556051105260849

shopify,[CASE STUDY] $150 in 20 minutes thanks to traffic from Reddit,"I found this [Case Study](https://mrwebcapitalist.com/i-made-150-in-20-minutes-thanks-to-traffic-from-reddit/) about a guy who owns a Shopify store. He tricked Reddit users into buying an iPhone cover from his store.

It is kind of Black Hat and immoral, so I wouldn't recommend anyone doing it, but it's still an interesting read.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it about:**

Basically, he found an interesting product. Put it in his shop.

Then he found some subreddits that might like the product.

He knew that linking directly to the shop would be a bad idea, because the link would've been taken down in an instant.

What he did is, he just posted a video of the product without any links.

The post started getting traction and upvotes.

Then with another of his accounts he replied to the post asking: ""Where can I get one?"" or something similar.

After that, with the 3rd account he replied with a link to his store.

&amp;#x200B;

**The results:**

in 24 hours he generated 6 sales, got a revenue of $150 and received 688 clicks to his store. Not bad at all.

dropship,Risk Operations have cancelled my payouts for 120 days...,"Hey everyone!

First time posting in here, but I've been dropshipping since November, set up a store and it failed (as expected, but it was a huge learning curve), set up a new store early December and I've been having some great success (not like those £10k a day people haha).

I was accepting both card payments using Shopify payments (stripe) and PayPal. I've started to have a really good month so far, doing nearly 20 orders in 10 days but 2 days ago I received an email from the risk operations team at shopify, who have deemed my products a risk and therefor have held my payouts for 120 days. I can still use my shopify store, but I can no longer use Stripe, and have to wait 120 days for my funds - which is very, very annoying. I'm not too annoyed as it's not thousands, but still...

I have had no complaints, no charge backs, or anything - I am in emails with them trying to resolve the issue and at least get my funds as per payout schedule, but has anyone else had this, or similar to this? (I'm not imitating any products, or advertising the product as something else)

Another question I wanted to ask, I know I can setup another payment gateway such as 2Checkout, but do people still have success with JUST paypal? I know customers can checkout using card as a guest without a paypal account, but I also recognise that a lot of people will get thrown off, if they can't just pay for card on the website and have to use paypal.

ecommerce,Question - How do I sell to dropshiping ecomerce sites?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

My company id doing well. We have a niche product base whitin a very big audience market. We have our own website, we do sell in marketplaces but all that does not rech 10% of our turnover. 90% is done B2B to other websites that buy directly from us.

&amp;#x200B;

As any company owner, I do want to grow a bit more, and for this year, I've decided to grow our product line, within the same market, but different niches. I've thinked on overalling our own website, marketing it, etc but I dont belive it is our path as I wouldnt have the force to compete directly with the  big players and I am within a very small local market.

&amp;#x200B;

In this case, I believe our best bet is to be become a dropshipper. Not buying from aliexpress and and selling in our website, but to sell our products on other websites. Unfortunatelly, to do that, we do need a bigger client base.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how do I do it? 

Do I just make one site private and only allow pourchases from registered costumers?

Where do I promote my products (Europe)

dropship,Everything you need to know about Instagram influencer marketing,"TL;DR: Learning how to make money online is hard. Finding reliable resources is harder. If you want to learn influencer marketing inside and out, read [this free book](https://www.oberlo.ca/ebooks/influencer-marketing).  


Hey all, Paco here. I’ve got a confession to make. Yes, I am from Oberlo. Yes, Oberlo is a marketplace/software for dropshippers -- and yes, I really hate the idea of being perceived as selling...   


But the reality is that I’ve felt the pain of struggling entrepreneurs first hand, and I firmly believe that this book will help you to avoid some of the major pitfalls when learning about Instagram Influencer marketing. I wouldn't share this on Reddit unless it was of real value to you. It is by far the most thorough - and free - guide for getting started with Instagram Influencer Marketing I’ve ever read.  


For me, the biggest challenge I’ve always faced when learning a new online marketing concept is finding a cohesive guide. Part of the challenge is that you need to piece information together from a variety of sources to start to get a clear picture. More often than not, free content leaves out crucial details that are vital to your success and comprehension.


I’m always on the hunt for one that pulls together all of the key fundamentals, goes deep enough into the concepts and presents actionable information, without me having to pay for it!  


The thing that has frustrated me the most over the years is that everyone who is teaching you how to make money online is also selling their proprietary knowledge or proprietary tool that must be used in order to achieve success. The truth is, you likely don’t need the tool and the knowledge is not proprietary.


Online gurus make wild claims about income to get you to sign up for their courses that most often lack any real substance or actionable guidelines. Don’t get me wrong, we have a product too, but I’d like to be explicit in stating that nowhere in this book does it say that you need Oberlo to succeed… We’re just really passionate about helping people build sustainable businesses. 


That’s why I really wanted to share this eBook with the awesome community in /r/dropship! I see so many people helping each other out in the various threads and it’s awesome to see!

dropship,A very transparent review of dropshipping,"Hey everyone, a couple of months ago, I was introduced to the concept of dropshipping. It seemed intriguing, being able to start my own business and work from home. I researched the topic a little bit more and decided maybe I’d pursue it, at least due diligence wouldn’t hurt. 

When I first activated my Shopify demo, I didn’t really have a genre or ‘niche’ that I wanted. When I was setting up my store, it just felt really stale, and I wasn’t inspired to sell anything. I put everything on pause until an idea came to me. I pursued something else, which is a facet of dropshipping, called print-on-demand. I had an idea, I made a store, and I was on my way. My friends helped me out with my first couple of sales, but aside from that, I didn’t know what I was doing. I wasn’t sure how to optimize my ad campaigns, I wasn’t getting outside sales, and this was all pretty stressful. 

I got a lot of ads from ‘gurus.’ To those of you who are new, gurus are, largely, scam artists who promise to turn you into a millionaire as long as you buy their $500 e-Commerce course. Don’t bite the cheese! 

So here I was, about a week or two in, struggling with sales, and constantly getting messages from these gurus. I would try and watch YouTube videos on how to optimize marketing, how to improve conversion rates, website traffic, etc. Essentially, I didn’t know how deep of a rabbit hole this was, because every YouTube video I had seen discussing dropshipping, made it out to be a very compact business model. That is not the case. I shut down my store about a month in because it just seemed to be too much stress than what it was worth. There are success stories though, so I’m not here to tell you not to do it.

All I’m saying is, if you’re looking to get started, be sure to do your research and be prepared to spend, and potentially even lose a little bit of money (anywhere from 0 to a couple hundred dollars).

`CLV = Total Spent + (AOV * ANO * (Avg Tenure - Current Tenure))`

(I will post this in a couple of other related groups as well and look for a variety of perspectives).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking to refine my offer based on what is needed - so here’s some things that I’m interested in.

1. Is email marketing a priority for you right now?  

2. Are you doing email marketing at all?   

3. If yes, why? If no, why not?  

4. What’s the #1 thing about email marketing that’s causing you the most headaches? (examples: setting them up in MailChimp/Klaviyo, putting the copy together, trying to decide how to segment your list etc.)  

5. If you’re currently catching emails, how are you doing it? Exit-intents, only after orders, pop-ups, etc.  

6. Are you offering a lead magnet for subscribers? (i.e. discount, free shipping on first order, ebook, etc.)  

7. How often do you send emails? And would you like to send emails MORE often?

BTW: just shooting me a reply to ONE of these questions is already extremely helpful for me :)

Consider these questions as inspiration - maybe you have some other things related to email that’s keeping you up at night.

dropship,Be Careful With Instagram Influencers,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started a dropshipping store about a week ago, so far have done many trial and errors with facebook ads with little success.  As of right now have spent almost $200 in advertising with only $35 in gross sales.  So, I decided to give instagram influencers a shot.  First guy, totally honest with almost 100k followers charged me $45 for a post and story for 24 hours, he delivered and kept his promise, but no sales.  Now-This next account reached out to ME from the original influencer that shouted out my store, and sent me his rates.  They seemed extremely good, he sent me analytics to prove engagement and even promised he was not scamming.  I ended up negotiating to $50 for 3 posts over time and a story.  I even took screenshots to prove that I had made this deal with him, in case he just didn't post then I would be able to take action against his account.  All of his posts averaged 1.5-2k likes, and he actually did deliver on my first.  75 likes over 24 hours.  So first lesson, always make sure the engagement is genuine and not bought or faked, which is pretty easy to tell if you just scroll through the likes or followers.  Now-Two days ago, I DM'd him again requesting for the second post to be set up.  He didn't open the DM all day, and then the next morning when I woke up his account was gone.  Completely deleted.  I have a personal instagram that I also looked him up on to see if he had just blocked me, and no.  This guy actually deleted his whole entire account with over 35k followers.  DM's where gone, no trace of him at all.  I have his personal name from the PayPal payment but honestly have no idea how I could ever get that $50 back.  No matter how many times these certain influencers tell you they are a honest business, do you research first and only spend what you are willing to lose.",40,23,2019-01-15,ECOM,0.03240431472659111,0.9226124286651611,0.04498329013586044

I am trying the 14-days free version on shopify. My goal is to create a B2B eyeglasses ecommerce platform, to support a grossist. So far, he has been going store by store, showing the products, so that the customer (stores) can buy it. At this early stage, for many reasons, he doesn't have much money to invest in an expensive platform. That's why I volunteered to help.

I am just trying to build a functional platform, with restricted acess to the retailers, so that he doesn't have to drive thousands of miles each time a customer wants to buy new models.  I have no background in web development. I managed to get it functional, but I feel like the design is not that good. Need to add more functions and understand better how to take the most out of shopify. But I feel like the free themes are a lot limited.

woocommerce,CSV Import WooCommerce product attributes English &amp; French,"# Hi everyone and thank you for reading me and maybe share some of your experience.

**WHAT I NEED TO ACCOMPLISH**

I have 90k products with about 600k attributes values and 5.5M lines of additional product meta to import to WooCommerce for a bilingual store. I've built routines in python to generate data as per the importing tools I have at my disposal.

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR**

To see if I'm in the right path to effectively import data to a performant Woocommerce store (2-3 seconds page load) that will require continuous import daily/weekly data updates. (price, inventory, sales, new products or discontinued ones, new attributes, new categories)

**CONTEXT**

This is my second Woocommerce store, on the first project I've worked on, we entered all products in both languages manually using WPML for translation. Result was as expected but somehow, even with all the required care and fine tuning, page load speed had a considerable handicap as soon as WPML was ON.

Reading on performance WooCommerce and I've decided to follow some recommendations and use Polylang instead.

**MY FINDINGS**

Looking around initially with Woocommerce native import tool I figured i'd create routines to generate CSV files for all simple and variable products, using an import tool that would read any updated files and hop, I'd deliver a eCommerce website that has some automated updates.

With the tools I've been using lately It's not so much mass import as for instance using WPAll Import and Polylang, I had to create about 2400-3000 routines (1 per language) only for all attributes values (ex:black) to be binded with it's translation (ex:noir), attributes names (ex:color) have to be manually added and translated prior. This has to be imported before importing the products themselves so products attributes get's translated otherwise you end up having to translate them all manually.

Importing tools have documentations, have a lot of features but some of them will import only products not attributes or other items you don't wish to enter manually. When having to deal with translation, this is a different ball game, documentation is poor and most of it is not oriented to handle translation.

**PLUG-INS I OWN**

\- [WP All Import with all packages and add-ins ELITE + EXPORT](http://www.wpallimport.com/)

\-[Polylang Business Pack](https://polylang.pro/downloads/polylang-pro-for-woocommerce/)

**CONCLUSION**

Keeping focus on performance and page load, and meeting minimal requirements in terms of features and visual, I'd like to know if there are better approach to accomplish this. Or maybe I should consider having a distinct website for english and one for french, as single site or multisite, it's pros and cons. Maybe there's a better way than CSV, like an API or a core Wordpress feature to import content (including all Woocommerce products and meta)

shopify,I noticed a big mistake a bunch of Shopify stores are making - here’s how to fix it.,"Hey guys, I’ve been working with some Shopify stores and noticed a serious mistake that kept popping up. I thought I'd share it with you guys (and how to fix it) so we can all sell more stuff.

In a nutshell, they were making their lives super hard by not training all the pixels that they could. Let me explain.

Pixels and tags are little pieces of code that platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google give you to track your visitors. They send data about how visitors interact with your site back to themselves. In return, they let you target these visitors when making ads.

This is important since advertising to past visitors is way more effective than trying to guess your niche’s age, gender, interests and other factors.

But if you don’t have all of your pixels installed from the beginning, you’re losing a lot of potential high value advertising targets.

A lot of stores have the Facebook pixel installed. That’s great, but it’s not enough. Facebook CPCs/CPMs are getting a lot more unaffordable and you’ll want to look to other platforms while your store grows.

At the minimum, you should have the Google Ads (Adwords) tag, Twitter tag and Snapchat pixel installed in addition to Facebook. There are others like Pinterest and Reddit tags that you can also install.

Each of these platforms make it super easy to grab the base tag and add it to your theme.liquid when editing your theme. 

The base tag lets you track what pages are visited so you can target people based on the URLs they’ve been to.

I’d also recommend installing conversion events. This is extra data you can send to these platforms about key actions like Add to Cart and Checkout.

Installing these gets a little too complicated for a Reddit post.

If you’re interested, I wrote a quick guide on how to install them for Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snap: [https://www.rvere.com/how-to-install-all-the-shopify-pixels-facebook-adwords-twitter-snapchat/](https://www.rvere.com/how-to-install-all-the-shopify-pixels-facebook-adwords-twitter-snapchat/)

shopify,SHOPIFY: Please allow app developers to comment on reviews.,"I'd like to make people aware of a big problem with Shopify and hopefully get Shopify's attention.

My business partner and I spent one year, worked very hard, and funded ourselves out of our own pockets to build an app for Shopify's platform. I used my personal savings and even sold a significant portion of my retirement portfolio to do so. My business partner and I have been very fortunate that our app is very successful. It is one of the most successful apps in the Shopify App Store. We've been really good to shop owners, we provide really good 24/7 support, and we listen to requests.

Our app generates more than $1 million annual for Shopify (the amount that Shopify actually keeps from the orders our app generates).

Our app also has a great reputation and a high rating overall, and we're proud of this. Occasionally we receive 1-star reviews, however, and some of them are warranted, I fully acknowledge, but a good number of them are unwarranted. For example, we've had people leave reviews like the following:

* A shop owner gave us a 1-star review because they were unable to figure out how to use Photoshop (our app allows shop owners to upload graphics). This has nothing to do with out app. Shopify refused to remove this review on our request.
* A shop owner gave us a 1-star review and complained that some tutorial videos related to general advertising on social media, not related to our app -- which we provide *free* outside of the app on a separate web site -- are only in English and not in Spanish. Shopify also refused to remove this review.
* A shop owner left a review the same day they installed our app, and they complained that we had not shipped an order they supposedly ordered one month prior to them even installing our app. It was impossible for them to have ordered anything without our app, and we even queried the Shopify API and thoroughly examined our logs, and the shop actually had zero orders. We provided evidence that this was likely a fake review, yet Shopify has dragged its feet for weeks now and refuses to acknowledge our removal request.

These kinds of reviews, unfortunately, are to be expected; however, there are two problems:

1. Shopify does not provide a way for app developers/owners to comment on such reviews.
2. Shopify refuses to remove such reviews. It only removes reviews that Shopify deems inappropriate, contain personal content, or are conflicts of interest.

It has become clear to us that Shopify does not care about its partners (""Shopify Partners"" -- those that build and mange apps).

Over the past two years, we as well as [other](https://ecommerce.shopify.com/c/shopify-apps/t/anyone-else-tired-of-the-app-review-system-416096) [developers](https://ecommerce.shopify.com/c/partner-feedback/t/request-the-ability-to-respond-to-app-reviews-like-yelp-497639) have asked -- privately via chat, email, phone, and publicly in the official forum -- that Shopify implement this functionality, but Shopify doesn't respond, or they say ""we'll pass this onto our developers"" and nothing is ever done. Shopify makes well over ~~$800~~ [$980 million per year](https://www.google.com/search?q=shopify+annual+revenue&amp;oq=shopify+annual+revenue&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2495j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), and it has the resources to add this feature; the company refuses to do so. This is shameful and conveys a lack of respect toward app developers -- who, in fact, drive a significant portion of Shopify's revenue.

This feels like a huge slap in the face. We (and many other app developers, with their apps) have added a lot of value to the platform with our app, yet Shopify won't take time to do this little thing to return the favor. To be quite honest, it kills any sense of loyalty for us with Shopify's platform.",20,35,2019-01-16,ECOM,0.04619915038347244,0.9205062985420227,0.033294521272182465
dropship,"4 products tested, 500$ in the red, only one sale so far, what should be my next step?","So I've been trying dropshipping as a side hustle, and I just tried the 4th product on my general shopify store, and I'm 500$ in the red (fb ads costs and whatnot). For this 4th product, I literally copied and pasted this [ad/product listing](https://www.facebook.com/HYGO/videos/226020808321306/), and for the my facebook ads, I had 15 interests, 7.5$ each, around pregnancy, moms magazines, parents with babies and toddlers etc, while excluding facebook admins and targeting the US, australia, New Zealand, France, and Germany. I ran a PPE and Video views compaigns on the video to give my post more social proof. Still I got only one sale, my first and only one so far.

I still have some cash to burn that I won't miss, but I don't wanna drop it again on dropshipping while I still don't know what I'm doing wrong (I know, more times than not, you'll not get a winning product, and you'll still need to test more products) but it can't be just all luck, otherwise it's not better than going to a casino.

So now I'm faced with multiple choices:

**1)** Keep going at classic dropshiping, trying to find and test more products that I can source initially from aliexpress, and hope something will work

**2)** Change strategy, pick some niche (or brand some single product), and try to become an authority in it (blog posts, social media accounts..) and dropship the products or buy some stock eventually. I might lose the ability to try to find and pick a ""winning product""

**3)** Find an audience (how and where? I don't know yet) and try to sell something to them. Seems like a lot of work to be put in upfront and I'm unsure if it would pay off

**4)** Drop dropshipping, turn myself to selling on amazon or something else

dropship,No Refunds?,"Good day all,

Around two weeks ago i started a shopify store dropshipping from Aliexpress. It has been fairly successful in my opinion and reached $1000 in revenue in less than a week. My niche is womens clothing, my question is that on my site i state that we do not accept refunds, however we will allow returns in exchange for another size. Will this work or would PayPal for example, still accept objections from unhappy customers? My site is fully legit i just don't want to have to deal with refunds as the supply of products are in China and my customers range from the UK &amp; US.

Thank you.",30,6,2019-01-16,ECOM,0.04352698475122452,0.9006443023681641,0.05582878366112709
shopify,E-commerce optimization checklist to instantly boost revenue,"##### When you optimize your store, it becomes more effective for your business. A more effective website can increase revenue for your business and reduce cost, through better conversion rates on existing marketing spend. 

##### So if you have an e-commerce store, and you want online shoppers to buy from you, you need to be able to quickly attract their attention – and make the shopping experience pleasant and easy.

#### Let’s start from some basic info. 

**What’s a good conversions rate?** The average eCommerce conversion rate is about 2.01%

**How to calculate the conversion rate for an e-commerce website?** If your online store is getting 10 000 visitors and 100 conversions for a set period, that means your store’s conversion rate is 1%.

#### How to use this checklist?

It’s tough to know where to start when there are so many possible things to optimize. If you know where to look, then just a few small tweaks can mean a 50% lift in sales.

That’s why we’ve put together this checklist for eCommerce optimization. It takes you through the most important optimizations steps for your eCommerce store. Do it and you will get more customers, make more sales, and recover lost revenue from abandoning visitors.

There are at least 71 points to improve. Don’t be overwhelmed. Start from the top and try to improve at least one thing every day. If you optimize 2 things every day, after one month you’ll have a well-optimized store. When you’re doing changes in your store, don’t forget to make it as an experiment to compare your results before and after the change.

[Go to checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12g7CB4XUvLjFgg3uYS7w8JvqVynDUuHY4lY1mVFAObQ/edit#gid=158929733) (Google Docs file)

#### Bonus:

* Reduce choices: Fix product filters
* Eliminate abandonment: Improve checkout page
* Make buying unavoidable: polish your product page
* Don’t let them leave: create an exit popup
* Referral sells better: have reviews
* Ensure the buying experience
* Make buying easy: fix your navigation

dropship,Dropship to India more profitable than US?,"Hey guys I'm new to this sub, so please go easy on me...

I'm not new in the dropshipping business, but Im still somehow a rookie to facebook ads, although I already blew a couple hundred dollars on it.

I ran an engagement campaign to India for some social proof and I got 60 ""add to carts"" within 2 days. Then I ran an conversion campaign ""view content"" to the US on the same page post, and I only got like 17 link clicks.

I spent 40$ on the US campaign, and only like 20$ on the India cmapaign.

I have FB pixel installed on my website. I ran a test ad for three days at $15/day and had several people visit the site, but no sales from the ad. I have good images and decent copy, but I know it takes time and refinement before people start purchasing. Any money invested right now would just be coming out my pocket, and though I have some to invest, I'm always afraid it won't be worthwhile, particularly right now with January being a slow buying period for people.

I have a company that sells coffee pods cleaning products. Company A. 

I run an Instagram account called Barista Skillz (to the naked eye, not related to Company A).

Behind the scenes I use a lookalike audience of Barista Skillz Instagram audience to send targetted ads for Company A

ecommerce,How to best sell types of products on my website that Spreadshirt doesn't offer,"On mobile, not a native speaker and a beginner at e-commerce so bear with me!

A few years ago I created a funny little cartoon horse called Fed Up Fred and I've finally decided to seriously try to come up with some merchandise. I started with Printful but the shipping was just too long. I went back to Spreadshirt mostly because I was already familiar with it, and because they sell prints as well as clothing which are the most important to me.

I created a shop in Germany and the US so people can pick whatever's closest to them so they don't have to pay too much shipping or customs. This is something I had a hard time with because I like to have everything neatly in one place. Now I have two pages, and the European has English (UK) set as its language so it would still be English, but now everybody has to pay in pounds. Which is a bit weird seeing as I pay in euros myself (I'm based in the Netherlands btw) but at least both my webshop pages are in English now.

So far so good; already selling some stuff which is awesome. But I'd like to be able to sell some other stuff at some point. Think calendars, maybe printed clickers and other training or grooming tools horse people might light with a little design on it. Notebooks, planners, anything that would be fun and useful for horsepeople. 

What would be the best way to go about this? Is there some way I can integrate my 2 spreadshirt shops neatly into Woocommerce and then use (an) entirely different e-commerce platform(s) for all the other stuff I'd like to try? Or is there a much better way to do all this?

shopify,My brain rammed into logic while trying to sleep tonight....,"I just started a shopify store, and I've been posting questions on here to get some good answers from experienced folk... I am starting to like this reddit thing dot com interweb thingy....

But seriously, I rammed right into logic after a couple hours laying in bed thinking about facebook ads... Ah yes, seems like everyone loves them, but I can't figure out why. Let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that starting out in e-commerce, a 1.25% conversion rate is good, correct? Is that the average and consensus here? I just ripped that info right off google without knowing how much actual shop owners are getting. But it seems rather low.

I am netting (or planning to net) $16 an order, but if 1 in every 100 people (1.25%) who have seen my ad and funneled through to purchase... it puts me in the neg about 2 dollars short. On my first campaign CPC was at $0.18 and it did 91 clicks... Sure enough, there was 1 person that showed up in the pixel who almost funneled all the way through to purchase, but ultimately did not follow through. Close one it was... lol.

&amp;#x200B;

But even then... If that one person ended up buying the product off of me, I would have taken in that $16.00 but that CPC would've cost me $18.00. This would cause me to realize that I am building a sinking ship or just taking up a new hobby by flushing money down the facebook funnel flushing machine.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am... Is my math wrong? Why do FB ads seem so costly in this scenario? There's got to be something I missed... Or perhaps I should find a product more expensive...

shopify,Minimum $$$ Needed For SEOs?,"Hola,

I'm a photographer and a full-time engineering student, and I've been building a Shopify e-commerce store for wall art. My main goal is to build a small secondary source of income ($1000/month) so I am able to pay for all my non-school related expenses and have a bit left over to save up. Also, I always wanted wall art in my home, but the local brick &amp; mortar stores are super expensive and I can sell art for much cheaper even if it's by POD.

The types of wall art I'm offering are metal prints, acrylic prints, canvas framed prints, canvas prints, and regular paper prints. The photographs on my site and mine, my photographer friends, and a few CC0 photographs found online.

The site is 90% done, I just need to get around to creating product images and uploading the products onto the site. I also have an FB page and IG profile set up. At this point, I should start looking into the marketing aspect of setting up an online store, but to be honest I have no clue about marketing.

My main questions are:

1. What is a good resource to learn about e-commerce marketing and to do it well?
2. What's the minimum amount I should have for this?
3. I thought about printing stickers for my store containing the logo, a short description, the URL, and a QR code. I can go around my city and put them up in high foot traffic areas.

dropship,Insane traffic - No sales - Left Clueless,"First off, I really don't like the idea of sharing my store like that. I'm looking for valuable feedback and nothing else. I don't expect more.

Here we go.

I've made 1 sale on my first ad about 2 jewelry rings.51$ profit. But since then... nothing

I've tested a few products, from clothings &amp; accessories to iphone cases to baby stuff. I've got a pretty good amount of facebook engagement which led me to a pretty alright amount of traffic (over 300 visitors in the past few days).

Yesterday, I've decided to stick with clothings and jewelry theme, as baby items and iphone cases aren't really working. If you check out the site at the moment, I've kept some of them in my catalogue for now.

Despite the shares and traffic, nobody is actually buying nor iniating the checkout on my site. I've tried PPE ads, Traffic ads, and Conversion ads.

Conversion ads just sucks up my money like crazy, traffic ads also eat my money. PPE ads are the only type of ads that really generated me ""traffic"". But I'm sure I have a very good product to offer.

Now trust me, I've watched many videos about this. I know, it's all about ""**putting the right product in front of the right people**"", and that's what I do. I actually do researches before putting up my ads to make sure I get value out of it. However, I never do. Doesn't matter if I add engaged shoppers or not.

I have tested so many products- my wallet is sick of it.

I thought about it before going to bed last night. I asked myself: ""What do I do when I see ads on Facebook?""

and my answer was: ""Well. I look at it, laugh, cry, smile... then I like it and share it. Then I keep on scrolling.""

Now you would say: ""Retarget these people"" and I agree, however, facebook only allows me to retarget customers only if I have at least 100 visitors from that country. Which I haven't.

dropship,"Started 2 dropshipping stores on Ebay 6 weeks ago, already made $3000 profit :)","Hi everyone.

I used to sell on Ebay for a few years (I haven't for the last 2 years) and I have just gotten in to dropshipping with great success so far.

It has been a steep leaving curve over the last six weeks, and I have had to find solutions to issues, find suppliers and shit load of admin work. The day to day running of a dropshipping operation is a piece of cake. Setting it up though is very hard work.

The positive to using Ebay is you don't have to do any marketing and you're open to millions of potential customers. Downside is the 8-10% sale fees suck. Also the $100 a month to open an Ebay store (and I have 2).

How do I do it? I simply chose a supplier, scrape their website and list in Ebay. I list manually and that does take a lot of time - probably most of my time listing products, but once it's done, it's done. I have worked out for every 70 products I list, usually works out to one sale a day. It doesn't sound like much, but once you have 3000 products listed, that's 42-43 sales a day. My margin isn't a %, but I add on $2 per item for profit. I don't list anything more expensive than $35. No one wants to buy $35+ items on Ebay (in my category anyway).

It also helps that I already have 2 Ebay accounts in good standing. One with 3000+ feedback and one with 150+ feedback.

My goal is to save enough money to launch my own shoe company and then eventually work for myself full time.

Anyway, feel free to ask me any questions.",95,83,2019-01-23,ECOM,0.03701690211892128,0.9217672348022461,0.041215911507606506

shopify,[Question] Which app will allow me to create an offer landing page?,"Hi.  I don't know if I am using the correct terminology but I will try to explain what I am trying to do.  I once clicked on a FB ad that took me to what seemed like a single product store; but it wasn't.  It was what I describe as an offer landing page for the product, with the ability to add to cart, add more than one for a discount, and then it would take me directly to checkout.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's say the landing page address was:  [http://www.example.com/blahblahblahblahblah/blahblahblah.php](http://www.example.com/blahblahblahblahblah/blahblahblah.php)

I only copy and pasted [http://www.example.com/](http://www.example.com/blahblahblahblahblah/blahblahblah.php) and voila!  I accessed the homepage of the store with all the categories and everything else.  I found the product that I was being offered in the landing page and went to the product page and it looked very different from the landing page I was taken to initially.  

&amp;#x200B;

So my thoughts are that this will allow me to have the best of both worlds between a one-product shop and a multi-product shop.  I could create an ad campaign for a product that is doing well, without having customers distracted by other categories when they get to my shop WHILE having only one store and not paying so much for every app for more than one store.

dropship,$5 Adset Testing Possible?,"Hello fellow dropshippers,

  
I've been running a dropship store since July 2018, however, I must admit not very successful.  
Also, I haven't been paying attention to it, lately, I started again and for the first time started using Facebook campaigns.  


I made one WC Campaign with 10 different adsets, each 3 ads duplicated.  
Got a few adsets working, however, due to testing I was spending more than I got out of it and stopped my campaign even though daily orders came in. The budget I used was $10 a day for each adset.

  
I am wondering at the moment what I should do, I was planning to test some other products, but I am wondering if it is possible to test products at $5 a day adsets using the WC objective. If so should I go for cheaper countries?  
And how many adsets do I need to make a fair judgment whether a product is worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, is it enough to run for 24 hours or should I run longer?

dropship,Custom packaging,"Good morning,
I was wondering if anyone has maybe found a solution for custom packaging when drop shipping. I am in contact with a supplier who support drop shipping, however, custom packaging requires a MOQ of 1000, which defeats the purpose of drop shipping.
I was thinking maybe it is somehow possible to find another service within China which would receive your product, package it the way you want, and then ship it to your client?
The issues I see with this is most likely it would increase overall time it would take to get to your client, as well as increased risk of things you can't account for which happen outside of your manufacturer's factory.

The main reason I want custom packaging, is since I am trying to build a brand around my products instead of a low effort fast cash grab type store.",12,29,2019-01-28,ECOM,0.06794174760580063,0.8749505877494812,0.057107698172330856

I'm working on the business plan and I'm having a hard time figuring out the supply chain part or aspects of the supply chain.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I am out of water here I am going to just explain it as stupidly as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the United States. 

and

I want to take a supplement powder from one part of the world lets say South Africa for example because this particular stuff is only available from South Africa

and

I want to package the supplement powder in a custom designed package

From there depending on a variety of factors either I'm going to have boxes of the stuff all over my home or I rent a storage unit and go through the supply or I have some other company pack and ship for me. 

Which, in my complete ignorance, I'm not even sure what happens once the raw materials meet the packaging. I know there are companies that will handle fulfillment but are there companies that handle package printing, fulfillment and shipping? And if so, am I better off completely eating that cost or is that something that should be avoided until things are really (potentially) swinging?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I know this might be all over the place but this is literally the part where all of my business ideas turn into to absolute dust, going from idea to product design to actually figuring out how the damned thing becomes a reality. This is the part thats just a giant black box for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently buyers tend to focus more on the numbers before the decimal than after which is probably why many retailers do this, but could it be considered deceptive, as in trying to make customers think that they're paying a dollar less for something?

shopify,Choosing a Niche,"Hello everyone.. I'm having another go at Shopify and dropshipping in generally after a 3 month break. My last store got no sales at all. My niche was cat toys/accessories.. I marketed and had many ads and even tried an influencer, but nothing worked. I gave up and decided to take a break for a while so that I could focus on my main job, teaching English.

I'm a U.S. expat and I live in Thailand. I need to make around $200-$300 at least per month. I do English teaching and am looking into flipping stuff I find and also dropshipping. I'd love to have the ability to do this full time. Finding the right niche is hard. There are so many things I could choose. I don't think I wanna do cat stuff again, because I was getting nothing from it.

How do you pick one? What are some good ones to get into? I've watched countless videos of people setting up their shopify store, and their niche, but I'm still feeling quite lost. It seems like a lot of the people making the videos aren't actually successful shopify dropshippers. It seems they just take the same old basic content and make videos about it and make their money that way. It's a little discouraging.

Anyways, if anyone could give me a push in the right direction that would be great. I hope I'm not being too much of a beggar. I'm just really lost.",16,5,2019-01-29,ECOM,0.05783809348940849,0.9038941860198975,0.03826775774359703
ecommerce,Don't assume dishonesty on nutty customer shipping claims,"Had a guy this week call me all frantic, saying his package arrived, but it was just an empty box with the end open. The guy sounded a bit off and my first reaction was that, it sounded like he was just making it up as he went. It almost sounded like he was deliberately trying to sound more upset than he really was. ie: My BS meter was going pretty high.

I told him to take pics of the box, whatever WAS inside, and any labels or stickers on the box. (For insurance claim) He sends me back a pic of the box that looks like it's in pretty good condition, other than the fact that the end just looks like somebody tore it open, and zero is inside. So it's looking pretty suspicious at this point, because the story seems a bit odd. Theft is unlikely, because what idiot is going to bother standing there tearing the box open. They would just walk away with it.

This was USPS. I've seen a lot of crazy stuff from them. I've seen stuff arrive missing half the items and resealed. I've seen them look like it was run over by a truck. I've seen stuff disapear in the postal black hole for months. But in a dozen years, I've never seen a relatively clean box show up with the end wide open, and absolutely nothing in it.

So I look up his local postal station. I give them a call. It was a small town in the south. Not only does the lady who answers the phone instantly remember the box, but she gives me the name of the manager who first noticed that it came in that way. Why they sent it on, who knows. But amazingly, the story is true.

So first lesson... Never assume the customer is full of shit, no matter how crazy the story is. Second... Never assume you won't be able to get any meaningful info by calling directly. I've actually done this many times with USPS, and it has worked more times than not. I've even had them send guys back to the wrong address and retrieve stuff. I've also done it with UPS and FedEx, but it's a lot harder finding the local numbers. Lesson 3... You don't always have to give in to the... 'just suck it up and give them another one'.. mentality. This literally took me maybe 10 minutes to do, and now I don't have to grind my gears, wondering if some nut screwed me. On top of that, I now have guaranteed proof for the claim submission.

Also... People can talk shit about the south all the want, but I live in a major 'progressive' coastal city, and the majority of times I've dealt with people down there, they've been way cooler than people where I live.",10,29,2019-01-30,ECOM,0.07566595077514648,0.8980441689491272,0.026289936155080795

ecommerce,Easiest/cheapest way for consumers to buy a physical product from us online?,"My in laws are selling a small physical product that they've created. We are trying to do it as cheaply as possible since they are really just trying to test demand (and even if there is demand, it's going to be small and local - maybe like $20k max a year.)

Presently there's just a facebook page and then if people are interested, they post their email address on the page and they get sent a paypal invoice.

I know that's a really dumb way to do it, but they didn't want to have to pay for a domain (or really not want to have to pay to create a whole website), or pay big transaction fees.

Years ago, I used clickfunnels with stripe payments for something similar, but I didn't know if there was a more efficient/cheap way to do it.

shopify,"Shopify theme editor - editing speed, Fastor, long TTFB","I am using a paid theme called Fastor which has many features and looks good.

But the big issue is that after almost every change, while trying to customize a theme in Shopify theme editor, it takes no shorter than 15 – 20 seconds of “loading” and applying the change. Sometimes it takes well over 30 seconds.

It is really hard to work on a site like that because there will be thousands of little changes that need to be done.

But also, just to preview what are the options, is almost unusable. (for example - 30 different types of header bar design, have to see them all before choosing one). 

I worked on a few other Shopify themes and the speed of editing was never a problem like this.

While checking what seems to be the problem, I found this in network tab after inspecting the page in Chrome - after every change, there are 10+ seconds of waiting time in Waterfall for some .scss files. It usually happens for files called rt.application.scss.css or rt.vendor.scss.css  and stuff like that. The blocking file is always rt.xxx.scss.css. Waiting (TTFB) for those files is always over 10s. Other files all load much faster.

The theme editor feels almost unusable this way. 

**Is there any way to fix this, disable some feature/functionality of a theme, somehow change those .scss files in order to be able to faster load those files**? 

&amp;#x200B;

The published website (frontend that visitors see) is always faster and doesn't have these long loading times.

I am located in Germany, don't know if that matters (don't know where Shopify has servers).

p.s. Is there any offline Shopify theme editor? I was trying to find but that doesn't seem to exist. Just to go through those setting options of a theme so I don't have to wait so long to preview how would they look online
