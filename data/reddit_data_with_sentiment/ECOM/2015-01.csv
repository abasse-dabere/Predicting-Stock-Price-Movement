ecommerce,"I'd love to get some guidance, I have no clue where to start.","Hello!

I'm having trouble doing research and I do not know a lot about setting up websites. I don't know HTML or CSS. 

So, i've got an idea to sell things online, but this ofcourse requires a website. I wanted a website where the customer can compile his/her own box with contents they have chosen. This requires (I think) a website, a hosting service, a domainname, plug-ins(?), HTML/CSS skills(?), some kind of a system that notifies me what the customer has chosen to be included in his/her order and probably a lot more. 

I've been looking at squarespace.com but i'm not sure if they can provide what I want. Do you think I have to learn HTML and CSS? Is there any other service which provides this kind of service? I have no idea where to start. 

Have a happy new year,

ecommerce,Building a new site,"Hi, I would like to thank everyone for their advice in advance.   
     A bit of background, I currently own two Shopify sites that make OK money. I recently found an older complementary site that makes most of its money selling on Amazon-  it has a website that's 10+ years- but its built on Magento and its pretty much non functioning.  I originally was going to build out the site on  Magento, but realized that its not necessary. 
  The site would have roughly 1,300 SKU's, I was thinking of using Prestashop and already found the template I want to use.  My questions are: 
1.  To have a good site what app would I need?   Shopify pretty much has everything included- so I am unsure what is needed, useful and whats a waste of resources 
2.  If I was going to just start a 100% new site (  I believe the current  owner is overvaluing the site)  How easy is it to mass upload 1300 Sku's to Amazon?  I currently use datafeedwatch - I believe they can do it, but to be honest I am not a huge fan of their work 
3.   While I am pretty well capitalized from savings of all my net profit- what is a rough estimate to build out a standard Prestashop site with 1300 sku's using the necessary apps?  The site would be broken down into 6 categories and I already own the pictures. I should also say A very close friend of mine who owes me a favor will be designing the logo. 
4.  Since most  of my investments so far have been stocks and real estate- I would consider myself ignorant- what questions am I missing?

shopify,Inability to enter coupon code before checkout has lost me untold amounts of business.,"I really don't understand this. You have hundreds of people complaining and asking to have the discount code box inside the cart tool because the paypal express checkout is non-intuitive for people expecting to enter a discount code.

How can this issue not be addressed? Why do you have the yellow paypal express checkout button as default for new stores? This is simply unacceptable and violates all ecommerce standards. Your competitors are able to solve this issue, why can't shopify?

I have been posting on reddit with discount codes for the past week, and I am at a loss to even begin to understand the massive amount of business that I have lost from people who leave their cart because they don't know where to enter a discount code. Abandoned checkout page won't help here. People have to actually begin checkout for abandoned checkout page to show that data. They won't even begin checkout if they can't enter a discount code.

I have solved the problem temporarily by disabling the yellow paypal express checkout button, but this issue is far from solved. 

Please advise. It makes me absolutely sick to know that you have this issue and are actively ignoring it. Pretending that it doesn't exist won't make it go away. Please DO SOMETHING.

We're looking to relaunch our Trade (we have a Shopify store for retail customers) website but as it's lower traffic usage, we don't require or want to pay for third party hosting. 

Does anyone know of decent hosting that we can self-host?  I'm currently looking at Prestashop and very close to going for that. Magento is too much as we're a small company and there's no technical staff beyond myself. 

I'm aware of OpenCart but not too keen on that based on what I've seen recently regarding the main dev.

ecommerce,"Hundreds of Products with Thousands of Variations Each. Or ""How to Break WooCommerce""","My company is selling fabric-wrapped bulletin-board-like panels.
[You can see our old store here and get an idea as to what we want to do with the new store.](http://www.fabricmatestore.com/p-3-anchorage-tackboard.aspx)

They chose WooCommerce long before I came along and it has been a large part of my job here to try and make it work even though I'm convinced it wont.  

The base product is the panel size: 12"" x 12"" or 36"" x 48"" etc... Each panel has 3 Variation Attributes: 3 Frame Colors, 2 Edge Profiles &amp; 5-45 Fabric Colors

We're using the WooCommerce CSV Import Suite, building the products and their variations in excel and importing the csv's. We import the variations at around 200 a time because doing more has a tendency to lock up the import process.

These imports seem to work fine aside from the fact that we can't do anything else with the site while it's importing. The problem occurs when we try to go to the store and test the products.

I'll use our Anchorage Panels as an example of the issue. There are 14 sizes for Anchorage with 208 variations per product. If I have 8 of the 14 products published the page loads fine and the products work great but changing 1 more product from draft to published causes the page to load blank; as in not at all.
It doesn't matter which 8 of the 14 I publish.

I've nested the panels into subcategories to try and fix the problem but there always seems to be a limit. Originally I had all of these Tackable Panels loading on one page but ran into this same problem which led me to nesting them into subcategories.

I know WooCommerce is not meant for this kind of thing but it's my word against the word of every developer that's come before me.",19.0,7,2015-01-07,ECOM,0.051361825317144394,0.9197409749031067,0.02889716438949108

I pretty recently took over running the ecom department of a local company manufacturing company. We're growing like crazy but I think we're missing opportunity.

I know from experience that having it increases conversions and shopper confidence, but I'd like to be able to quantify it as best as possible.

Searching Google just gets me a lot of Amex spam, so I was hoping someone might have recently come across a white paper or study regarding this.

ecommerce,Looking for a new way to integrate our ebay/Amazon stores with our Volusion store.,"Currently the small business I work for processes everything through the backend of our Volusion store. We use a separate service called Invicore to sync our ebay and Amazon orders with Volusion. Unforunately for us, Invicore has abandoned support for Volusion. We constantly have product mapping issues where items are pulled over to Volusion or too many of one item is pulled over. Since Invicore abandoned support for Volusion, we have no means of getting this fixed.

Because of that, we're looking for another solution. We would like to keep using Volusion so we need something that integrates with it. We're also a Mac/OS X environment so we need something that supports that as well...which will most likely be web based solutions.

We've gone through demos of Stonedge/Monsoon Pro, Solid Commerce and Channergy. Channergy seems to be the best all-in-one fit, but having to remote in (since we don't want to spend the upfront $20k to buy the software) is clunky and the UI is horrible.

Ordoro seems like a good fit, but they don't support Volusion currently. SellerExpress is another option that I'm looking into.

We've even thrown around the idea of completely separating out our ebay/Amazon stores from the Volusion store, but that raises problems all of its own...keeping inventory in sync, etc. We also need something that can do bulk listings since we have around 7k items in stock. That would take forever listing each one individually. Invicore is limited in that aspect as well which is why we currently only have ~1100 items on ebay and ~2500 on Amazon.

Any input on companies to look at (or stay away from)would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",5.0,3,2015-01-07,ECOM,0.05784985050559044,0.906450092792511,0.03570004180073738

ecommerce,From scratch feet wetting - how do I get started for peanut money?,"And I mean peanut money both ways - initial cost (I have hosting, so $10 for a domain?

I don't want to spend really more than the $10ish to start, and I will not be disappointed if it takes months to make that back.

So that leaves a lot of unknowns for me.

Product selection. What do I sell? Where do I go to find stuff to sell, dropshippable, with an API I can plug in to my cart with a little effort?

Exposure / SEO / organic growth - I'm pretty much bare basics when it comes to SEO - content is king, but for a cart I'm not sure how relevant that would be.

Or is this the wrong way to go about it? If I put in a few days (full days) of work customizing a cart and setting up products, and then after a few months it's paying for a meal a month, I'd consider that a great start, you know? But I don't know enough to even get there.

ecommerce,The Rise of E-shoppers,"Well, one of those e-shoppers is me, and once you get bitten by the e-shopping bug – you are hooked on for life! Yes! With the Internet today, providing a plethora of online shopping sites, that offer apparels, electronic gadgets, furniture and even grocery- it has become the greatest virtual mall invented ever.
 
And while I write this article, you will find a thousand shoppers online trying to buy something off the shelf at their convenience and price. Yes! Convenience is what lures everyone today -with an increasingly hectic lifestyle and even longer working hours, leaving lesser and lesser time for any personal tasks. E-shopping allows you to shop for your needs at the click of the button, at the convenience of your home or work (during that coffee break) and at the time you want!
 
So let’s look at the other benefits that one can get from online shopping:
 
Choices, choices and more choices – If you think that a mall can offer you a wide range of choices, think again! Your online stores have much more to offer! For example, fashion and lifestyle e-commerce portals like Jabong or Myntra provide you with the option to browse through a number of catalogs, with clear filters on the price range, size, color, material etc., adding to the user friendliness of these sites. So you just get enough exercise for your wrists and eyes and can sit comfortably in your chair or sofa at home, while you pick your items at your leisure.
 
Pay as you like – What online shopping also offers is the various modes of payment. While actual shopping provides you with either card/cash payment or payment through gift cards, online shopping allows you do all this and much more. You can avail the number of discounts and offers that they provide, or pay on delivery of your purchased items at your doorstep. Online supermarkets like Zopnow do just that. They offer you a number of discounts, loyalty points and deliver all the items to your house at the time you choose. So you get your grocery shopping done at the comfort of your home, and not spend even a second walking through each block, getting pushed by other shoppers, finding your way through each shelf for the food items you want, or even carry those heavy bags till your house! Phew! That’s a lot of work!
 
Affordable, and pocket friendly – With an increasing number of e-commerce portals offering the same things, most e-commerce portals today, try to get a competitive edge by offering discounts and offers. This allows the consumers to compare and buy stuff that’s fits their budget, and a lot cheaper than what you get in actual stores.
 
Save time and effort for all your personal tasks – You Don’t need to catch a bus or auto; stand in long queues; get squashed in crowded malls or hypermarkets, or spend all your time searching for things. Online shopping gives you loads of time to do the things that actually require your time and effort – like reading that book, or catching up with friends, making more time for family, or even watching all that missed episodes of your favorite sitcom or soap!
 
Now if you ask me – how can you purchase without looking at the product first and feel it in real? I have only one thing to say- Most savvy e-tailers have overcome this barrier in various ways. Many online fashion sites provide interactive catwalks, product description, advanced zoom facilities, view from multiple angles and even hover boxes. Some even incentivise through a wide range of online options such as exclusive items and also provide convenient delivery and return options- and some even free shipping!
 
A recent Online Shopper Survey conducted by the data analysis firm comScore, reveals that 70 percent of more than 3000 online shoppers surveyed, preferred online shopping. What’s more – By 2017, eMarketer estimates that one-fourth of online sales will be mobile-based as people conduct more of their lives on smartphones and tablets. The spread of tablets in particular will drive mobile commerce; and by 2017, nearly three-fourths of mobile retail sales will be done on tablets, with 125 million people using them to make purchases.
 
But with so many e-commerce portals offering the same things, how does one gain a competitive edge? Staying ahead of competition requires action across multiple aspects – product portfolio, operations, marketing, customer service etc., and all of these need to work in tandem to achieve the desired outcome.
 
Here are few ways that will give a head start in the race -
 
Product offerings- Offering a wide range of products, can gather more audiences. But then again, most of them already do. So, how about catering to the needs of a specific audience – becoming a specialist in your offerings? Your store could then become “THE” place to buy that particular product. Also quality is of utmost importance for any online purchase. Be sure to nail that!
 
Ensuring you are never out of stock – Ever wanted to buy a product really bad and found it out to be temporarily out of stock? Well, that’s one customer lost! So you need to have an inventory system that never runs out of stock, gaining an advantage over other online stores that do. But, even if you do run out of stock, you could also set up a notification for your customers on the availability of the product and throw in a gift coupon or discount if they signed up for notification. You will have a happy customer who is sure to come back. 
 
The right price- Offering lower prices can provide incentive for your customers to purchase from your online store. But what you also need to do is give them full information on pricing, as consumers today are more informed and would have done their background check before stumbling upon your website.
 
Free shipping- Shipping is one of the most important things that needs to be executed properly for future sales. Providing your customers with carefully packaged and free shipping creates that competitive edge.
 
Get ranked higher- Getting found is another important factor when consumers are looking for products they want to buy online. This is where SEO comes into play, helping you get you ranked higher and improving your website traffic that can convert into sales.
 
User-friendly website- Making your site easy to use can work wonders. While this is basic, most companies forego the basic for some fancy design. So make sure it’s easy to find stuff on your site, with logical grouping of products. Provide plenty of information and accurate description of your products. Make your order system easy with lesser steps to fill, and provide multiple payment options. Send out regular, personalized newsletters with useful information to your customers. Also make sure you are easy to reach out to, and that there are multiple ways in which you can be contacted. And last, but not the least, try getting an mobile app for your website!
 
Guarantee policies- You can gain competitive advantage online through customer-oriented return policies, on-time shipping guarantees and service results.
 
Friendly staff- A friendly customer support system is also important to cater to the needs of customers. Prompt and friendly replies go a long way to keeping an aggrieved customer.
 
Brand image – Getting the brand equity of a Nike or Coca Cola is not an easy job. But it’s not impossible. You can get your customers to talk as much about you on forums, reviews, and blogs. Harness the power of word of mouth and viral marketing to allow your customers to become your brand ambassadors.
 
So now that we’ve talked about all the advantages that online shopping offers, and what marketers could do to gain a competitive edge, it’s time, you try out some e-tail therapy for yourself! Trust me! You will be amazed at the extra time you get! And to all the marketers out there, you could try a tip or two to gain a loyal customer base.",0.0,1,2015-01-13,ECOM,0.03112270776182413,0.9275235235691071,0.041353752836585045

We are currently managing customer service requests (ie from the Contact Page) by having the system send out an email to everyone associated with CS or Sales.

Does anyone have any experience using a ""portal"" of some sorts, where incoming messages could somehow be marked as ""responded"" or ""unread"" (whatever)? We're considering going with a separate email account that can be logged into by CS reps, but it's not my ideal solution.

ecommerce,A quick way to start selling software ?,"Hello,

I am completely new to this as last time I was selling a software product online other people handled it for me :) I have completely no idea what solutions are available so specifics  would be appreciated even if they seem obvious to you. Now to the point.

I need some very simple site where people can buy license keys from me and download my software. Here is list of the requirements:

-integration with popular payment processors; I need people to be able to pay via Mastercards/Visa next most important thing is Skrill (many people I am going to sell to use it and I use it as well and it would be nicer than PayPal) integration, then PayPal then any other popular payment provider which does business in EU and USA (I am EU resident and I am going to sell worldwide mainly to EU and USA)

-very simple site, 3 or 4 pages with some very basic info; no advanced design needed; possibility to attach blog to put news/information about new releases etc. would be nice

-this is optional although something I would really love to have: ability for my clients to make accounts; I would like to put download links for them once they log in; this is important because I may want to prepare different versions of the software for different clients (it depends on target hardware/preferences etc.); the store doesn't need to know anything about it just provide possibility to put different download links for different accounts and add/remove stuff from them and automatically forward next license key from the list once the payment is made;

-I can host downloads myself (and only put links in people's accounts) but ability to host would be nice as well

-3-4 different products (so license keys from 3-4 lists)

Example of a website with functionality I need:
Removed

My priority is to get it running fast. It won't be high volume so I can even send download links manually to people. The store just needs to notify me that payment was made. I am going to take care of promoting my product in different venues so the website just needed to link to, to process orders and for people to quickly check if there is something new.

So, what are my options ? Is there any more info which I can provide to make my questions more specific/easier to answer ?",1.0,2,2015-01-15,ECOM,0.02656600996851921,0.9329937100410461,0.040440335869789124

In today’s time every individual is looking for convenience and E-Commerce is a tool which is providing them complete convenience at a reasonable price. It is spreading it’s wings in India very fast whether it is booking a ticket for Railways, Flights or a Movie. But still this sector is not completely explored in India as there are many things which can come online.

So the wide scope of E-Commerce represents golden opportunities for the young entrepreneurs who want to be a part of the success story of E-Commerce in India. Some other unexplored sectors or less explored sectors include online room booking in hotels, Online cabs, food ordering, niche products for online retail, Restaurants in all cities etc.

ecommerce,Help me choose a new ecommerce platform,"Hi all,

I built a custom PHP shopping cart for my parents over a decade ago, and finally decided that we need to migrate.  It's old, hideous, and probably insecure.

I'm right now mostly torn between a hosted solution (squarespace I think is most likely), or one of the terrible existing solutions like magento, prestashop, etc.  

The site doesn't do very much revenue, so I'm trying to keep costs down as much as possible.

We're shipping around 20 unique physical products and only see around 300-500 UV's per month, so it doesn't need to handle much volume.  I just want it to be clean and fast.

The cart must-have features:

- real time shipping estimates (we currently use a custom shipping algorithm, but could probably abandon some of that)
- google analytics integration
- one-page checkout... I HATE multi-page checkouts
- secure checkout - too many solutions are using Authorize.net's AIM or DPM options which are NOT PCI compliant IMO.  (only SIM)
- if we go for a non-hosted solution, I'd like to change to a good cheap gateway like Quantum/CDGCommerce instead of Authorize.net

And...the big catch:  We process a lot of over-the-phone orders currently using Authorize.net's virtual terminal.  What worries me the most is that solutions like Shopify don't give you that terminal, but rather tell you to just place the order yourself or use the mobile terminal, neither of which are ideal.

They also have several customers that receive a regular discount (20% or whatever), where they manually process those orders via the virtual terminal.

Thoughts on the best solution?

Hosted solutions scare me because of their limited customization. That said, we probably don't really need that much.

Non-hosted PHP solutions still look either (a) terrible and old to me, like magento or even prestashop or (b) are way too new to trust like Sellvana, Sylius, etc.

Suggestions?  I'm so damn indecisive but really want to pull the trigger before Authorize.net hits me up",20.0,2,2015-01-17,ECOM,0.11169923841953278,0.8662225008010864,0.022078193724155426

I put this website together in October 2014 using Shopify. I had big visions for this site, hoping to accumulate enough capital from retail sales to start making First Person View remote controlled quad-coptors, land rovers, and submarines.  

However, my wife just gave birth to our 2nd daughter, and I have accumulated more responsibility at my full time job. Basically, I don't have time to commit to this website.

So it's up for grabs. It's hosted on Shopify.  It's a monthly fee of $23 (I signed up with a promocode).  I would send you all the pictures, the logos, and transfer the domain to you.

I haven't spent any time promoting, and it hasn't made an sales.  

I'd like $1500 for the site. But all offers will be considered.

But in recent times, people have embraced the use of online shopping in Viet Nam and some few classified sites are doing great in Viet Nam.

These websites might not be as big as Ebay.com, Amazon.com, walmart.com, Target.com or newegg.com but they have developed in the Viet Nam online community and Vietnamese seems to have embraced this online shops.

Just like every other E-commerce store, not all online shopping shops are legit, some are only a phishing website for unknown customers and will only trick customer into buying products for a much cheaper price, only to rip them off their credit cards.

Aside from the E-commerce website in Viet Nam, Vietnam also adopted the craiglist method of buying and selling. The idea of buying and selling in Viet Nam is still new in Viet Nam and only few Vietnamese have welcome the idea and are currently using the classified section if they cannot afford buying a new product at an E-commerce store. 

Some popular online store in Viet Nam and trusted by online shoppers in Viet Nam includes :

LAZADA: Lazada is one of the biggest online shopping mall in South East Asia. It features the world big brand products on it's website. Aside from Viet Nam, Lazada is also available in countries like ; Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines and Malaysia. 

           
Their headquarter is located in Malaysia. Looking at the website of Lazada, it looks so nice to the eye and offer a good website for online shoppers. All Lazada websites seem to use the same E-commerce template/theme, giving them a unique design and unique identifications. If you need your walmart, target, amazaon or newegg in Vietnam. Lazada is what you need.

A lot of shoppers have certified Lazada.vn to be one of the best place to shop as your transactions are secure and the staff are professional in dealing with clients. At the moment, Lazada is giving out 50,000VND ($2) for shoppers that sign up...Ohh Did i tell you that you can download the iOS and Android app for LAZADA.

ecommerce,"Anyone else manufacture and sell their own products, but also wholesale and dropship for others? Having trouble integrating them all.","I'm having a really hard time solving this problem and hope someone has done this before and is willing to help. 

We manufacture our own product and sell it online via Shopify. We also have wholesale accounts that we sell to, in addition to drop shipping for other retailers (they are currently emailing us customer orders). 

Has anyone been able to integrate all 3 of those channels into one inventory control system while automating the processing of orders placed via drop ship? 

I was hoping to have something like Stitch Labs or Lettuce act as the master inventory control, but both of them lack APIs for integrating dropshipping orders (i.e. if we set up an automated CSV processing system that could them import via API). They do well when acting as inventory control for Shopify and wholesale, however. 

This is becoming very time consuming on our end to manually process all the drop shipping orders, and I've held back on pulling the trigger for Stitch Labs because we can't integrate this way.

The other solution I was thinking of was setting up a password protected Shopify storefront where the dropshipping retailers could log in and enter their user orders, but I'm afraid that this would be a barrier to entry for setting up new accounts. 

Any thoughts? 

For what it's worth we're about to set up fulfillment through Shipwire. So it'll be Shopify + Stitch Labs (or some other inventory control platform that can integrate with Quickbooks Online) + Shipwire.

This morning when I woke up, someone had already bought purchased the produce, yay! But unbenounced to me, Amazon seems to have run out of stock. Next to the product listing on Amazon it says, ""Usually ships in 1-3 months. Of course this is very different from what was promised to the buyer. 

Is there anything else that I can do besides contact the buyer and inform him that he will have to either a) wait 1-3 months or b) let me refund him the money?

Also, I'm new here and don't really understand how dropshipping fully works. If this product was in stock, would I really have to purchase the USPS shipping label that they're prompting me to buy on ebay?",8.0,0,2015-01-19,ECOM,0.02327837608754635,0.9177247285842896,0.058996908366680145

ecommerce,"Outgrown Shopify Plus, What's Next?","Without going into specifics — we are a lifestyle accessories brand that started out on Magenta Go and then migrated to Shopify Plus over a year ago. As of right now, we are definitely one of their's more technical, forward-thinking and innovative stores. Our sales and traffic are growing exponentially, and I can't help feeling that we've embarked on a path to outgrow the platform. I would love to hear some suggestions on where to go next. 

A little bit about our current situation and requirements:

- We are wholesale / online only. 
- No brick &amp; mortar location so no PoS integration necessary.
- Ideally, multichannel (B2B + B2C).
- Enterprise solution or something that could integrate Borderfree.
- Not SaaS, and not an on-premise hosted platform.
- Compatible with a small and lean team consisting of a web developer, UX designer, and front-end developer. We are all very hands on and good at what we do, wanting to develop something custom instead of reworking a ready-made template.
- Modern technology platform with great API and theme development documentation.
- Specializing in medium to large online retailers.
- And of course we don't want to lose any of Shopify's current offerings in the process.

We aren't after a giant like Demandware and are definitely more intrigued by someone like WebLinc, especially with their recent expansion efforts (completely rebuilding their environment using Ruby on Rails) and having similar clients like NastyGal and FreePeople. I haven't seen their name thrown around these parts so I'd love to hear if we are on the right path.

ecommerce,The Wrong Way to Do eCommerce,"I will be the first to say I am by no means the most successful sole proprietor eCommerce store owner....NOWHERE near it.  But I think my approach--which allowed me to grow my eCommerce store from initially knowing nothing about my niche, to $20,000 revenue in 3 months after launch (and growing) may lend a perspective.

I also want to make clear that I am not here to criticize or belittle.  I used to make ALL of the mistakes I mention here, and once I stopped making them things changed almost instantly.

I see a lot of posts on here about ""review my website"", ""how do I set up my LLC"", ""what's the best marketing app for XYZ"".  To me, this highly conservative approach of waiting for approval and feeling like you have to have 100% correct and full ifnormation to get started is incorrect.  The solution is to focus on taking Massive ACTION.  In other words, every day, you should be able to compellingly answer the question:

1. What am I going to do today to reach my goal?

and at the end of each day, answer:

2. Did I do those things?
3. If not, why?  What needs to change?
4. What went well?  What didn't?

Issues like how to file an LLC, how to set up a bank account, what marketing apps do XYZ...you can easily find those through Google.  

Don't allow your not knowing everything presently to hold you back from taking Massive ACTION.  What are you doing right now:

1. To make more money?
2. To increase exposure?
3. To systemize your business so that you can hire people to perform its functions?
4. To increase your profit margin?
5. Etc.

When your day is focused around relentless action rather than getting stuck in details, things will change in a big way....at least, that's what worked for me.

Just my 2 cents.  I'm sure some people are going to be mad, but I sure wish I had read this post 2 years ago when I started trying to internet marketing and ecommerce.",14.0,13,2015-01-20,ECOM,0.03492480888962746,0.9191471934318542,0.0459279827773571

My question is this: am I putting myself at a disadvantage by selling a well-known brand (one that would be easy to find locally in brick and mortar shops) rather than a lesser-known brand (that the customer would not be as inclined or willing to search elsewhere for)?

One thing to note is that the company of the well-known brand doesn't sell direct to customers so their products would require a little more work by the customer to find elsewhere online.

I am just worried about drawing to customers to the products who then leave the site to buy elsewhere. I'm targeting a niche in that specific market that appears to be undeserved.

Do I wait for customer to receive goods before paying vendor (that seems a hassle to find out when delivered) or just pay vendor when order received and let the customer fight it out with vendor if they complain?

Also if the item arrives damaged and customer needs to return it - or wants to return it within the 14 day EU limit - this will be a hassle to sort out. So the customer would pay for shipping / courier and then get repaid by the vendor + shipping costs?

dropship,"Who's interested in forming a small network of few experimental drop shipping sites? Just need some like minded individuals, who are willing to do things right.","A little background on me: I'm a college student who can't stop embarking on new business ventures, opportunities, even just learning experiences. 

    **What I have to offer**
     I have experience / currently am up to the following shenanigans: 
    1. working for a very major ecommerce company, as an intern 
    2. ebay sales history, paid my first year of college w/ it
    3. social media marketing experience, on and off
    4. decent grasp of web developing + e-commerce basics 

I've been exploring what the 2015 version of what drop shipping company can be. I've heard all kinds of shit about this business ""model"" , which can get scammy, risky and even just too competitive.
    
As an aspiring entrepreneur who has been obsessively observing the condition of e-commerce, online advertising, SEO effectiveness -- even evolving fulfillment operations around the nation -- I have grown to believe it's the right time to get into this game (to be rolling in time for peak season). I have the vision, I just need someone, or a group of people who are willing to set their minds to this. 
    
**I am NOT seeking investors on this board, nor am I trying to fish for some kind of equity deal here.** Chances are, this will be something I grow from the ground up. This is your chance to participate in what I will call a 21st century business environment, where we will collaborate online and become a successful, **WHITEHAT** (yes, I'll use this term here) drop shipping operation. 
    
*Plus, my job is a major player in why I think this can be interesting.*
    
TL;DR : I think I'm special and such. I'm starting a drop shipping business, and I'm still picking my niche(s). If you're someone who feels inspired to start or partake in a similar business, or you have ideas, let's set up an NDA and get a conversation going :)

ecommerce,Web analytics tool that shows you revenue-maximizing prices for your ecommerce products.,"Hello all,

I just want to share a tool that I made called PRO (Price &amp; Revenue Optimizer). It helps you optimize your ecommerce revenues by showing you revenue-maximizing prices for your products. It uses the Google Analytics API so if you have Google Analytics E-commerce tracking set up all you have to do is sign in with Google and it'll work out of the box. Here's where you can take a look at it:

simplemetrics.com
(you'll have to type it into your address bar as the sub rules say I shouldn't post a link here)

Background / Why I made it:
Like a lot of people I've always had some trouble getting my pricing right. In particular I've had trouble with a data product I've got available for sale on one of my sites. The site was my first one and gets a small amount of free traffic, but since I don't actively work on it I'm keen to get as much passive income from it as I can. I have always been unsure of whether it's better to charge a relatively high price and accept low volume or conversely charge a relatively low price and gain relatively high volume. So finally I thought I should just set up a proper, flexible tool that enables one to see the right metrics for this price/volume trade-off problem.

This is just v1 of the product, so any thoughts/feedback would be warmly and happily received.

I recently set up an affiliate program and was wondering if anyone here had some advice for finding high-quality affiliates to work with?

So far this is what I have done to find affiliates.

* Reached out to existing friends with websites or audiences.
* Contacted customers to see if they would like to earn a little cash by sharing our products with their friends.
* Searched Bloglovin' for small blogs in the Design, Photography, and DIY categories who may feature affiliates.

I started my efforts last week and currently have 4 affiliates. All of which are friends with websites.

Hoping to get somewhere around 25 affiliates to learn from and work with, and scale as I see fit.

Have any other ideas for finding the right affiliates that might be better to collaborate with, rather than just friends and existing customers?

I own an ecommerce business. I need my customers to be able to ""credit"" their account at my online store in order to make monthly pre-payments for one of my company's services.

ecommerce,Shopify's ecommerce platform allowed me to build www.sendpubes.com in 9 days with no prior experience.,"I was lying in bed reading barstool sports and I saw an article about these dudes in Australia sending Glitter Bombs.  Immediately I flashed back to freshman year of college where my roommate received a huge envelope of pubes from a buddy of ours.  I was laughing by myself and I thought why not give it a shot.  After all, pubes are way funnier than glitter.
  
The next day in between appointments I started researching out-of-the box ecommerce platforms.  I have never done this before.  If you couldn't already tell by my product choice, I did not graduate from MIT.  I was looking for simple, but not some cookie cutter bullshit either.

It came down to Shopify and Square Space, they both seemed like solid services and since I didn't know what I was doing anyway I randomly choose Shopify and I am so happy I did.
  
I chose the $29 a month option and I was off.  Or so I thought, the first day and a half was challenging.  A ton of trial and error.  Slowly but surely I started to figure out what the hell was going on and then it became fun.  I came up with a back story and built the site around that.

A brief synopsis of the back story is that a guy by the name of Montgomery Ellington III is a Pubillionaire [pyoob-bil-yuh-nair]. His passion in life is pubes, not women, not money...just pubes.  Anyway, with the end in sight he realizes he has to pass his pubes on to others.  So he created www.sendpubes.com as way people could pay forward his massive collection of the finest pubes in the world.  Simple really...pick a premium Pube variety, identify that special someone, create a custom message and Pubes are sent.

Anyway, back to Shopify and why I love them.  I called them two nights in a row after 2 am and got a live person in 20 minutes.  They were a really personable and helpful team. Not to mention they had great Canadian accents.  I knew I loved Shopify when a guy named Kevin at about 3:30 am helped me change some backend code so I could change a title from ""Feature Products"" to ""Featured Pubes.""  In addition he helped me erase a troubling variant from 'Granny's Grays' product page. We were both kind of serious at first, but eventually we were both dying laughing trying to complete each task I had.
  
The subject matter being what it was this guy could have easily blown me off, instead he helped a total novice build a site about sending pubes.  Bottom-line, if you are looking to dip your toe in ecommerce or a site of any kind I would highly recommend doing it on an out-of-the-box platform like Shopify.  The entire site to this point has cost me only my time and about $60.  Even if I don't make a dime on send pubes, I have gained some good experience for the next one.  If anyone has Kevin's address please contact me, I would like to send him a fresh batch of pubes!  Cheers Shopify!  Also, any feedback on the site would be great.",0.0,1,2015-01-27,ECOM,0.06060953438282013,0.9075512886047363,0.03183921426534653

woocommerce,Should I take on this WooCommerce Project?,"I run a web design company. We install Wordpress for people, manage it, and blog all the time. A client wants to hire us to use WooCommerce to build their online store. They sell cell phones and accessories. We do not program PHP. We have nobody on staff who can program. Will we be able to make them a good store using our web designers or is programming usually necessary? If we want to hire somebody to develop the store for us, will that likely be a long-term complicated contract or should this be relatively simple? We just don't want to get in over our heads.

ecommerce,Free eCommerce &amp; digital marketing consulting in exchange for data access/case study credit and opportunities to experiment,"Hello,

I'm an eCommerce/marketing consultant...and I'll cut to the chase: I'm looking for a collaboration with an online store whose owner is willing to let me test new tools, try out new high potential channels, do various A/B tests etc. (of course, every change/experiment will be pre-approved by you).

What that means for you: basically free consulting on a lot of areas that can lead to increased sales, reduced costs, increased customer satisfaction etc.

What that means for me: the chance to try out new [maybe better] tools, write quality case studies and 

Why would I do this? Well, my current clients are not very open towards sharing any kind of data that would be interesting to present in case studies (conversion, traffic, abandonment rates etc.) or do not target an English speaking audience and that means I lose a lot of opportunities to publish great content/case studies.

If this piques your interest, let me know and we'll see if we can figure out a win-win approach!

P.S.: Sorry if this post does not comply 100% with the rules...I think it might be in a gray area...",8.0,2,2015-01-29,ECOM,0.015205741859972477,0.8191657066345215,0.1656286120414734

ecommerce,eCommerce photos with white background -- How can I do this easy?,"I've spent hours and hours taking photos, using a lightbox, lights, high aperture and a tripod to ensure stability and high quality photos. The photos look great -- except the backgrounds aren't pure white, you know that lovely white you get when all three color channels are at 255 giving you that perfect background that blends.

I did a bit of photoshop research and I know that I can use masks and such to make the background white but this seems like it could take days if not weeks to edit all of the pictures. Forget the recurring cost to do it again when new products come in. There has to be an easier way.

ecommerce,looking for marketing tips,"my GF and I just started selling our own high end stationary (at least I think it's high end). Our products are colorful and simple, they print on great paper and ship with nice packaging. We're selling on Amazon and have a portfolio site on Squarespace.

We're slowly engaging an audience on Pinterest &amp; FB, and I'm starting to blog with plans to do content marketing there. We're also soliciting reviews from well-known reviewers on Amazon. 

Any other tips for marketing our product? Our goal is to build steady sales, so I think we should be building a strong brand. Not sure about that one though. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!

woocommerce,Want to add pick-up-points to shipping. What should I do?,"Hello! I've made a shop for a game, where you can buy in-game stuff for in-game money. The world is huge, and we have around 3-5 pick-up-points spread around the map. I tried to add custom fields to the check out, but I couldn't get it to work as I wanted. 

I want to add more shipping options. The users can select pick-up-point A, B or C, and then they will se a fixed price for that pick-up-point. I was looking at [this plugin](http://www.woothemes.com/products/local-pickup-plus/), but unfortunately, I can't afford it right now. I don't mind paying a small amount for it. 

So, is there anything like Local Pickup Plus, but more simple? I don't need to enter adress, zip code, state, etc. I just need to enter a name, and a price. 

Is there any way I can do this? Hopefully there is a plugin like this, but in the worst case, I can fix it with coding.
