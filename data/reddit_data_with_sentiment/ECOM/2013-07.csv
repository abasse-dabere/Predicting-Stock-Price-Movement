ecommerce,My jewellery store is ready to open for business - how should I proceed?,"So I've finally managed to finish creating my ecommerce site - a jewellery store specialising in contemporary Indian jewellery.  I have no real experience with marketing/advertising so I'm not sure how best to get this to market.

My initial thoughts are to place an ad either with reddit (targeted to /r/twoxchromosomes?) or facebook.  My gut tells me that facebook might be a better option although I don't have anything to back that up.  Does anyone have experience with either?  Are there other more suitable methods that I am missing?

The site is as ready as it's going to be for now and I just need to try and start selling.  There are many things I would like to improve on the site, but I expect they will happen over time.  Any advice on how to take the next step and start selling would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

ecommerce,managing and updating a growing inventory...,"**TL;DR: large inventory (in my mind) that's growing, don't know how to update/maintain. What do you do?**

Hello /r/ecommerce,

I'm self taught, and duct taping along helping a family member with his business. Currently our product database has about 150 items. Once a year without fail my boss will want to update at least 100 items, their photos, meta descriptions, titles, etc etc. We're hosting on bigcommerce, we like it and have few qualms about it after testing several other shopping carts. I just can't figure out a better way of updating lots of products.

The inventory is growing, and my boss keeps changing his mind about the order of product photos, the information on the product pages, and in general has problems settling on a standard.

Basically all I do is go through each product entry to edit the product descriptions or replace photos. It's a slow and tedious task (but I guess that's my fulltime job). I could try bulkediting the CSV export, but editing on excel is a special hell I would like to avoid...

So here's my question: What do you do, or do you have a special method of updating or maintaining a large inventory? (Edit: or is my boss just psychotic and I'm reasonably bored out of my skull?)

(edit2: large in a sense that I have no idea what i'm doing and it's becoming slightly overwhelming)",9.0,3,2013-07-08,ECOM,0.07560347020626068,0.8995223641395569,0.024874236434698105

I have been sending our products to review sites for traffic and awareness. This works and I have plans to improve this process website specific discounts for sale urgency etc.

ecommerce,Looking for advice on our ecomm site.,"Hey guys, I read this sub everyday but have never posted.  I'm currently managing a ecomm site that sells refurbished IT hardware, built on Magento - the brand was created as a sister company to one that is much more established and has built a very good purchasing/inventory management system.  Began work on branding/site construction just over a year ago and have grown now to a team of three - me, developer and one acct manager.  We rely on our sister company for shipping/receiving, techs, accounting, purchasing etc.  We have 40k+ pieces of hardware in stock that we offer with very aggressive pricing, as many of our online competitors are purchasing from our sister company once they make the sale and we drop ship for them.  

Because of this we have pretty good margins and we're now generating a fair amount of revenue.  The problem is the bulk of that revenue is being generated from ebay / amazon and not the website, as we are having alot of trouble converting on our website traffic.  The positive there is that we are building a very good, data rich product database, that we can easily push out to all selling channels like ebay etc.  We are doing a lot of really creative things to drive traffic with automated posting to craigslist, and automated video creation for youtube, but the traffic doesnt seem to convert.  Same with adwords traffic.  We also get good traffic organically based on our meta info, url format etc.    Thats been a big push lately.

Our products range from $10 to $100k+ so converting on the higher end products is a bit tougher, but with the high purchase price, we can afford to push alot of adwords if we can get them to convert.

I know we still have a ton of work to do related to organizing categories, etc but does anyone out there have any more advice for us?

ecommerce,Recommend a shopping cart that integrates into an existing website,"My [company's website](http://www.gameswellplayed.com/doku.php/home) is based on DokuWiki. Last year I discovered WePay and have used it as my website's shopping cart system. I like that it is an ecommerce system that integrates into my existing content; when I want to add a shopping button, it's just a snip of code that I add to the wikitext at the appropriate spot. Nonetheless the WePay shopping system has many shortcomings that are causing me to replace it.

The advice I see here on Reddit and in other forums is that, with a full-fledged ecommerce platform, you create your store and then integrate any non-shopping content into the store using whatever interface is provided. I'd like to keep my wiki-based site running if possible, however, and find a more powerful shopping cart system that plugs into my existing content in the same way that WePay does.

Can you offer any recommendations that keep me from having to start from scratch with a new website?",6.0,2,2013-07-10,ECOM,0.017335232347249985,0.9304705858230591,0.05219423025846481

ecommerce,Looking for a Booking System that integrates with Google Calendar,"Hi,


I'm currently researching for a friend about a simple online booking system that will use Google Calendar. So people can book the items, pay and the slot will be added to the online calendar including adding the customers email address (and maybe phone number) for reminders etc.


I have noticed extensions for Magento but they seem expensive and excessive for what is a small site; I only need to book a service and take payments via PayPal and then make sure that time slot is not available again all onto a google calendar (or something equally as sync-able to phones).


If anyone has any ideas, I'd be grateful.

I've been hosting my personal websites using a shared hosting service, but I was told for e-commerce you should use a dedicated server for traffic. I don't anticipate heavy traffic right away and after speaking with customer service at the hosting site I use (site5.com) they told me I shouldn't have to worry about it for a long time. And if I make my site efficient I can have thousands of site visitors before needing a dedicated server, and if it's coded inefficiently I would need a dedicated server much faster.

So I'm now making a flow chart for my site, and I'd like to know what an ""efficient"" site would entail. 

Thanks.

Done well, they add value to your customers and to your online sales transactions. The biggest risk is to see upselling as an opportunity to grab as much cash as possible in one transaction. While extra revenue has to be the ultimate goal, the way to get there is through enhancing the customer experience and offering service.

I came here to ask a simple question with probably an extensive and confusing answer...

I'm at the stage of choosing a niche to sell, and I read that I need to get my tax info in order before I can start getting quotes from wholesalers. What tax information do I need to know? I guess what I'm asking is, what tax stuff do I need to apply for before knowing anything about my market?

I've had mixed information and I'm baffled. I've never dealt with sales tax or tax exemptions before. I'm willing to spend as long as it takes to learn about it though.

Also, how much should I expect this stage to cost me?",2.0,2,2013-07-23,ECOM,0.029727691784501076,0.92170250415802,0.04856979846954346

ecommerce,Problem with OpenCart background. Any chance someone knows what the problem is?,"The background fades out at the bottom, like the white-background box in the middle just disappears into the body background color. I would really like the background black, but text is unreadable at the bottom of the page. There's a picture of it with a black background and a gray background for perspective.

I'm not crossing my fingers, but any help you can give would be much appreciated.
