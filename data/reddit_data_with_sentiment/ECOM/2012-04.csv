ecommerce,Responsible Development of Penny Auctions,"If you spend some time on the web and PAW especially you’ll hardly need to do any deep digging to find strings of messages filled with unfulfilled expectations and rigorous contempt as another website gets exposed as measly petty scam rather than a penny auction.

Suppose it’s no surprise that the cheated user’s mainly aimed their distaste and concern at penny auction owners, and it’s justified to some extent as they are victims of their direct actions. But will this approach do justice to the whole community? Can we really put all the weight and public responsibility of keeping penny auctions safe on common users, community vigilantes and stray luck?

ecommerce,eCommerce Platform Suggestions,"Hi /r/ecommerce,

I've spent the last few weeks playing with every eCommerce package I can get my hands on, trying to find the right one for our yet-to-launch business. I think I may have narrowed it down to one, but I'm hoping for some advice before we pull the trigger.

What we're looking for:

* Affordable
* Mobile Optimization
* Turn-key or easy configuration

I've played with VirtueMart, osCommerce, ZenCart, Magento, 3Dcart, and have finally come across BigCommerce, which is my favorite thus far.

I'm not a developer, but I'm pretty technical and managed to get the open-source platforms up and running. I'm having a horrible experience getting all of the functionality I'm looking for out of it, though, and at this point I'm ready to say ""screw it, we'll pay $25/month to get a hosted package."" I'd almost gotten an installation of osCommerce working with a mobile extension, but of course there's a million little bugs; and bugs aside, it doesn't look especially polished.

It seems like in the age of smartphones, though, there are very few eCommerce providers who really provide realistic solutions for a small business to have their sites mobile-optimized. Magento Go doesn't include it (I'm not about to try and host my own Community version; like I said, I'm done fighting with this stuff) and although I was really liking 3DCart in general, they want an absurd $300+ or something for that feature. Give me a break!

At this point the only affordable option with mobile optimization, that I can find, is BigCommerce. For their $25/mo package (not including a merchant account; that's separate), mobile optimization is included and working properly right out of the box. Awesome!

Surely they can't be the only company who does this, though, right? Also, there is zero customization for the mobile layout (it's not terrible but I'd definitely make some changes), unless of course you're a CSS guru.

I'm about sold on BigCommerce for this reason alone. Working mobile optimization, turn-key solution, affordable pricing for a startup business. Can anyone talk me out of it, or provide an alternative?",17,3,2012-04-17,ECOM,0.04664592072367668,0.9211454391479492,0.032208628952503204

dropship,Getting started?,"Ah, here it is!  I knew that post would lead to a sub sometime soon!

So I am intrigued.  I have some $$ to burn and some time.  I have a friend who is also in the same boat.

Neither of us have ever created or run a website but I do consider us more tech savvy than the normal layman.

We've been researching possible product lines and have narrowed it down to a few that we will be calling suppliers on.

I notice most suppliers offer website creation.  Is it best to utilize these services or to create your own using either Volusion or simply creating from scratch?  Do I then need to register the site with a hosting company?  I know we all hate GD so who do you go through for that?

And then finally, once the site is up and running without any products, this is when we would then go to the suppliers and request to sell their products, correct?",6,6,2012-04-20,ECOM,0.03473656252026558,0.9302491545677185,0.03501429781317711

dropship,Newbie here. What kind of products can I expect to deal with?,"As DropshipRedditor mentioned in his AMA, there are some markets (e.g., clothing, electronics) that are wholly dominated by the big boys. With that in mind, what kind of products does drop shipping make use of? How specific should our ""niche markets"" be? Baseball bats were used as an example in DropshipRedditor's beginner guide; going off of that, would one set up a website selling only bats, or selling assorted baseball equipment?

Also, I *just* started reading up on drop shipping, but here's how I understand the process to go. Tell me if I'm on the right track:

* Set up website
* Find wholesaler/drop shipper
* Place wholesaler/drop shipper's products on website
* Market products

Then, once you actually get customers:

* Customer buys something from you
* You notify your wholesaler/drop shipper of the sale
* You pay your wholesaler/drop shipper for the product, they ship it to your customer

Does that sound right so far? If not, where did I go wrong?

Cheers.

Edit: Also, if you have wholesalers for completely different markets, would you set up separate websites for them, or go for a Costco kind of environment?",2,6,2012-04-23,ECOM,0.07349568605422974,0.9065232276916504,0.019981080666184425

dropship,One way of doing it,"Personal Experience with drop-shipping and getting creative.
A while ago I saw a post in the Wanted section of craigslist looking for ""Live Eels""
Being curious, I emailed the guy to discover that his current supplier couldn't provide enough eels for this guys restaurant and he needed an additional 1000 pounds of live eels every two weeks and that he was currently paying $5 per pound.
Being a 22 year old with an bit of a egotistical complex and knowing absolutely nothing about eels, I was convinced I could find eels somewhere for lower than $5.
After a couple of hours on the internet, I found a guy in Canada who was selling them for $4.50 a pound. After calling him and negotiating a long term business relationship, I was able to talk him down to $4/pound. I then contacted the restaurant guy and told him I could sell him the extra 1000 pounds at $5 per pound and gave him my paypal info. As soon as the money was transferred I had the eels drop shipped from Canada to this guy's address in Boston. And now every other week I pick up $1000 profit for international dealings in live eels.
