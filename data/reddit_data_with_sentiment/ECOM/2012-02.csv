ecommerce,What do online retail owners think about the power of social commerce? would love the group's opinion on shopa.com,"Hi everyone. I have been a redditor since 2009 and am on to my second tech start-up. We have just received a ton of funding which I’m so happy about. We launch in May and would love the group's first thoughts on our social commerce concept at http://www.shopa.com. Please view the intro video. 

Basically we have set up a success-only payment mechanism to your users for any successful purchase of your products they help generate. i.e. instead of paying money blindly for marketing, you incentivise your users to share your products to their networks and if any links they create result in a sale you pay them a commission level that you set for that product. You only ever pay out if a sale is made. No risk!

Would love your thoughts of the concept and intro at http://www.shopa.com

ecommerce,Selling in a physical and virtual storefront simultaneously.  Can't think of creative solution.,"I plan on opening a physical storefront that will sell used goods, but I'd also like to offer those goods online simultaneously.  Since the goods are used, each one would be unique.  The problem I fear is that I might sell the same product twice; once in person and once online.  What would be the best way to organize and structure the two storefronts to ensure this doesn't happen?",7,3,2012-02-08,ECOM,0.030381429940462112,0.9235839247703552,0.046034593135118484

ecommerce,can you help me with getting a website up and running?,"Hey all,

I'm trying to add an ecommerce aspect to my business, but I have very little experience making websites. can you guys answer a couple questions?


-We will be selling ~300-400 sku worth of products online, and require a professional and clean (doesn't need to be that fancy) site. How much should I expect a website like this to cost if I hire someone to develop it for me?

-If I have someone develop my website, how will I manage it? Will operation (such as inventory management, website updating) be turnkey and very simple? I'd love to hire someone full-time to keep the site up and running, but I don't think I could afford it. Is the task manageable for someone who like me who isn't particularly technology saavy?

-I'm leaning toward using Magento as my platform, but I'm not sure. I hear it loads slowly, is expensive, and difficult to learn. Advice would be much appreciated on this matter.

-Is it feasible for me to make the site myself and learn everything? I've made some really basic websites before using html, but thats about it. I'd really like to launch the site ASAP.


Thanks in advance for any help.",9,4,2012-02-22,ECOM,0.021060017868876457,0.9257107973098755,0.053229205310344696
