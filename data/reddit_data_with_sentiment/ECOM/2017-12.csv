ecommerce,Woocommerce vs. Bigcommerce?,"I know it's a bit like comparing apples to oranges, but I need advice. We are revamping an ecommerce site and plan to do a relaunch by Q1 2018. I had started using woocommerce with Divi, but recently one of our drop shippers recommended using bigcommerce, as many of their big clients have migrated to them.

Even though we are starting out, we are looking towards the future. We want a platform that will grow with us. I am not sure if Woocommerce will handle a large amount of SKUs. (server is not as problematic, our hosting provider does provide VPS.) However, it seems like Bigcommerce can grow with a business. I like the integration BC has with AMP pages and Amazon/Ebay. It seems like not many large businesses or enterprises use Woo. I am also concerned about security for both.

I started a free trial with BC to test it out. I notice right away that customizing themes (especially the css files) are a pain, compared to being able to edit css with a live preview with ease in Wordpress. (seriously, why does BC need to put code in a bunch of different css files that are spread out all over the theme files?!) For example, I want to move the navigation menu to the right and be inline with the logo. Wordpress/Divi? No prob, it's already built in with that theme, and even without Divi, I could easily do it in a theme's css and/or microthemer, if needed. Bigcommerce? Spend 10 minutes just trying to find the .navpages in the css files that are all over the place, (which even using Chrome's developer inspector on an element didn't work. The file name that comes up is an endless line of characters, instead of the file directory that is shown in stencil editor. Jesus Christ.) and none of the css I tried worked. (I'm still learning html/css, so I'm probably missing something.) Also, how do you customize what appears in the nav menu for BC? I'm used to having a menu customizer in Wordpress.

I don't want to disavow BC just because of my coding skills, so I am asking you all:

Is BigCommerce customizable? Is their security and uptime trustworthy? Since they will be hosting everything, the last thing we want is our stuff taken away.

woocommerce,Custom product boxes,"Hey guys!
I'm writing this with hope you can help me figure out how to configure or what plugin to use in order to achieve what I need, using woocomerce.
I'm starting my own business, an online bakery, and I'm having some problems configuring my website to look and behave the way I want it to.
Let me contextualize my situation before asking you what I want... I'm trying to sell pastry cakes (individual cakes, like muffins and croissants, etc) in a box format. That is: you can order those individual cakes but you have to do so in a certain quantity, in other words, you may very well choose the cakes you want but you have to order, at least, a box with 5 pastry cakes (they may be all the same or you can individually choose all five of them differently).
The way I imagined you would have different prices per cake, depending on the size of the box you were to ask. If you were to order between 5 to 9 pastry cakes (as I said before, you have to order at least a box of 5) you would pay 1€ per cake, valuing your order between 5 to 9 euros. If you were to order a box that contained between 10 to 14 pastry cakes you would pay 0.9€ per cake; and so on for higher quantities.

I've bought a woocomerce plugin that allows me to create produts in, what they call, a custom product box format. It almost allows me to configure the website the way I want it to. It allows me to create a product (the box, in this case) with no cost, that allows the costumers to add the pastry cakes they want, and allows me to define the value of the pastry cakes for each different box. So, right now, I'm able to provide a service where you can choose the quantity you want and, depending on the quantity, of products, the box you chose is able to store, the pastry cakes have different values.

That being said, it's still very flawed and far-distanced from what I want and envisioned. For starters, since I divided the pricing categories based on quantity ranges (5-9, 10-14, 15-19,&gt;20), the custom boxes I created can only fit 5, 10, 15 and 20 pastry cakes each; I can only fix the smallest quantity of each category as the biggest quantity you can order per box. Is there any way possible for the costumer to add more ""space"" to the box? 
I know I sound confusing, so let me give you a practical example: I'm a costumer and I'm having a party at my house. 6 people are comming, and I want to order 6 pastry cakes. I go over to the website and I have the option to choose between boxes from 5-9 , 10-14 or 15-19 cakes. I click on the box that fits the order I'm about to make, and that is the box from 5-9 cakes. I should now be able to add a slot to the box, since the minimum size is 5 products it makes since that the box initially only has 5 spaces (to add the cake you want) and I should be able to add up more 4 slots, were I to want more than 5 cakes but less than 10 (in this case I want to buy 6 cakes). 
Furthermore I have no way to set the minimum ammount of products to buy. You can just choose 3 products (instead of five) and proceed with your purchase.

Can someone suggest a way to configure the plugin I'm using or another pluggin that will allow me to create a box, starting at a minimum of 5 cakes, and with a possibility of adding limited slots to add more products to your box?

Thank you very much",2,3,2017-12-02,ECOM,0.05102899670600891,0.9195340871810913,0.029436854645609856

shopify,Liability of reselling AliExpress knives?,"I'm pretty new to shopify, and am considering opening an Oberlo store that sells survival &amp; tactical equipment. Included in the product catalog are a number of knives (hunting knives, folding knives, etc), and I was just wondering on how the liability of that works, as I'm reselling the knives from an official Chinese manufacturer/distributor. 

I've searched around a bit and found that people making hand crafted knives are advised to have a liability insurance in addition to a disclaimer, but what I read is a bit conflicting with some people saying a disclaimer should be fine, other saying it's worthless. I intend on having a general liability insurance, and put the company under a separate legal entitiy. I'm based in Norway if that matters to any extent, and intend on shipping worldwide.

My questions are:

- Do anyone have a concrete experience with this or something similar, if so how did you go about tackling liability?
- Can you be held responsible for the knives when you are not the manufacturer?
- Is there anything else I should be on the lookout for? I saw some people saying a good lawyer can make arguements based on what the knife is sold as, namely if you call it ""Killing Knife"" you could argue it's catered to some peoples killing fantasies and encourages such behaviour. Obviously bullshit if you ask me, but I know how slimy lawsuits can be and I'd rather dodge any kind of such hassle.
- Should I for instance put a disclaimer in the description of every knife so it's obvious that you're responsible for it yourself?
- As I'm a dropshipper, I don't handle the knives physically, so to what degree can I be held responsible if they break and injure the user? Would having a disclaimer of improper use or something similar even be of any effect here?

Any feedback is highly appreciated!",0,4,2017-12-03,ECOM,0.05666636675596237,0.9188638925552368,0.02446979284286499

woocommerce,How can I show users an item is being added to the cart?,"When I click 'add to cart', it can take a moment to return to the user that the item has been added.

I'm not sure if it's here - https://docs.woocommerce.com/wc-apidocs/source-class-WC_Cart.html#866-976

But want I want is either the button to change to 'Adding to Cart' whilst the function is working, then back to 'Add to Cart' when finished. Or, have a overlay div, preventing the button from being pressed whilst the function is performing.

At the moment a user doesn't know the product is being added so can easily click the button several times and end up with 4 or 5 items in the cart.

Is there a plugin that already offers this?

I'm happy to delve into the PHP but I don't know where to place it. Alternatively, I could have JS do this, then wait before reverting to the original state but this wouldn't be a clean solution.

ecommerce,Woocommerce vs. Shopify-which is best for dropshipping?,"An update from my last post, I have narrowed it down between Shopify and Woocommerce. My challenge right now is to find a solution to the following:

-We plan to start by using multiple dropshippers (and some in-house shipping) for our site. These dropshippers are not the common ones. (so not AliExpress or Orberto) Which means we need:

-The ability to add multiple custom distributors and attach them to products (this seems easy enough with both.)

-Automatically update inventory for all vendors (ideally feeds, if not at least CSV quick import)

-Most importantly, customize and automatically show shipping rates for the vendor assigned to the product. Otherwise, we risk losing substantial margin on miscalculating shipping. This has been the most difficult thing to find between the two. IgniteWoo's apps seem to offer the best solution. My only concern is their Pro app is new and I am not sure how stable it is. Shopify has a few apps scattered, and many of these apps will only do automation with their distributor network, not a custom supplier.

Does anyone have experience with dropshipping with either of these two platforms?

EDIT: Just looked up IgniteWoo, they seem to have a long history of poor support and issues with their plugins. The fact they don't provide demos is suspicious.

ecommerce,Expanding A Pretty Country-Specific Brand To a New Market &amp; Switching Platforms,"Hey there,

I'm running an ecommerce site in Canada that has slowly grown from a side project to a primary focus over the past few years and I'd like to start selling my products into the US. I'd also like to switch from WooCommerce to Shopify so that I don't have to worry about managing hosting, a CDN, updates, and all that.

My problem is that my brand is very country-specific. My product is ""Canada [Products]."" Most of my sales are organic and the brand name has a lot of good will in my local market, but I'm afraid that name will alienate the US marketplace. I own both the .ca and .com domains, so I do have the opportunity to launch a sister site and product that doesn't have country-specific branding.

Obvious down-sides to running two parallel sites seem to be:

- duplication of effort
- duplication of shopify costs
- division of SEO efforts and results between two sites
- potential confusion of visitors who land on the wrong country site
- potential SEO penalties for duplication of content


I also have some reservations about switching to Shopify, as I'm used to the level of agency that WooCommerce provides me, but I suspect that in the longer term, with other staff managing the platform, it will be beneficial for things to be simpler.

dropship,First time Reddit User,"Hey guys, First time Reddit  user and first post.  Please go easy on me. 

Can't believe I didn't discover this place years ago. Lots of awesome info and advice.   

So I just 'retired' from in the Coast Guard after a 20 year career and over the past several months have been following the advice of my herd of peers trying to get a consultancy job.  Throughout this process I have had this nagging feeling  NOT to live the commuting / stuck in traffic / work in a bullpen / 9-5 life.   But I applied to these jobs anyway, tried to network, kids ass, etc.  nothing!  Even though my career in the military was a great success, and thought I was this rock star, I have been humbled in a big way over the last 4 months.  Countless rejections, being told I am not an 'exact match',  phone calls not returned, being told to take entry level positions  to build experience over a number of years in the hopes that one day I may get promoted.  Wow! Totally depressed that I allowed this to happen to myself. 

As this time has gone on, I started asking myself, is this the path you want your life to take (e.g. Work for someone else, be beholden to what others think you are worth, work for the next 20 years in a job I hate, slowly losing excitement for life).   That's when roughly 2 months ago I discovered ecommerce, Shopify, dropshipping and it was like some lightbulb went off saying this is it! 

I've said a lot but you get this gist. I want to do this but am scared shitless.  I've got a lot to lose being 45 with a wife and 2 small kids. 

Question:   When you guys first started out, did you all have real jobs to pay the bills or did you 'burn the bridges' and go for it all in? I have been going all in over the past few weeks (designed a t shirt, using printify, creating llc, launching Jan 1)) but I realize how much work this will take to launch and sustain which I'm willing to do but my need for cash flow is real. If I were single and in my early 20s this would be a no brainer.  However, with my family commitments, I'm am conflicted.  Given what you all know about what it takes to start a successful online business,  would you focus your efforts on getting a real job to pay the bills and work this ecommerce business part time.  My preference is to burn the bridges and work it full time as I know I could make it work.  Just seems risky to go all in.  

Sorry for the length and I'll keep you updated on progress!",14,7,2017-12-10,ECOM,0.034333180636167526,0.9253876209259033,0.04027925804257393
ecommerce,"Only do eCommerce stuff once a year for a charity calendar. Not having the experience, where would you go for help?","So we have a pop culture news site, we only have it to help promote charity things. Once a year we have done a charity calendar.. last year we got marketing help, all help we got cost many times more than the cost of producing the product, beforehand was all how much they would help and drive sales and after they drove zero sales it was either went dead on us or blamed the product. The one who said they would give helpful advice and then just started trashing on things still annoys me a year on.

Last year we raised for service dogs for kids with autism, this year its a charity that does mental health stuff like suicide prevention, depression, etc etc. Fairly well known one in Australia.

So far we have run some ads this week but the cost is FAR outweighing any ROI. I think I need help from someone who actually knows their stuff not someone who says they know their stuff.

Any suggestions where to go for hands on help? (eg like Cloudpeeps but someone who will actually get some results, we aim to do this for breakeven.. all profit is going to the charity so it's more about not posting a loss for us).",3,6,2017-12-10,ECOM,0.056364357471466064,0.9066160917282104,0.037019480019807816

ecommerce,Need software suggestion for inventory and order management,"Hi,

Our company has grown our multichannel e-commerce business rapidly the past 2 years; however, one area where we are experiencing growing pains is inventory management alongside with manufacturing order management. We sell accessories through various websites (except for our own which is still a WIP).We have over 2000+ skus and are constantly growing our catalog. We work with a handful of manufacturers whom we either buy product from or take product on consignment. 

Our issues are as follows:
1. We are having a tough time getting visibility across our catalog on what skus should be re-ordered and how much we should be ordering.

2. We don't have a clear way of communicating manufacturing orders. I.e. I'll see that one of our skus is sold out. I will email 3 people on my team, who then need to find out who made the piece and what the components are. They then need to place a PO (purchase order),  which gets generated on our old-school ERP and is attached to email as a pdf. Once it's out there, I have no way of tracking or seeing how many open POs we have and when I can expect delivery. Sometimes, we even end up placing duplicate orders because of the inefficient communication process we have.

3. We also have a tough time of knowing when to send inventory to FBA and how many units to send. Obviously there is no magic number, but I rather have data driven forecasting telling me I should send X units by Y date to FBA based on sales data rather than me just saying ""lets send 15 units next week because why not?""

I'm probably missing a few pain points, but I'll add them as I recall them.

Thanks in advance. 

***Additional Points***
1. Ideally something that can be integrated with other solutions.
2. Not necessarily looking for an all in one. Happy to consider a ""stack"" solution (is that the right phrase?).
3. Reduce manual labor when it comes to entering orders from channels.",6,8,2017-12-11,ECOM,0.07481472939252853,0.8882763981819153,0.036908846348524094

I’m trying to create a coupon that offers a flat rate shipping fee when applied.

We've looked at companies like ShipMonk and such, but one of the problems is integration.

dropship,The biggest problem I see with most of your stores:,"Y'all have no branding whatsoever.

Like, why the fawk would I (or any consumer for that matter) buy from your store? What unique advantage do you have that would make me want to purchase from you instead of an established brand that's been in the game for much longer, has better shipping times, better customer service, etc.?

Y'all are just trying to make a quick buck and throw up whatever products you think are gonna sell well without thinking about this shit long term or even looking at how you can provide value to your customers.

Don't even get me started on the fact that y'all be using some ugly ass themes and using some basic ass template that literally no one in their right mind would buy from.

Go back to the drawing board and instead of just thinking about what products to sell to make money (that a guru promised you would make in some Facebook video), actually try to create value in some way. 

Focus on building a brand (and come up with a unique selling proposition).

And I don't mean something stupid like ""great customer service"" (although I will say that's necessary for every business in this day and age), but focus on real branding. That may be through education of your products or problems that exist in your market that your product can alleviate. It may be through building a sense of community through your products and customer base. It may be through creating a mixture of 2 niches that haven't been blended together before. Or whatever.

Branding can come in many forms, but don't think just throwing up a cute little logo is gonna count as 'branding'. No, it takes more than that. Branding has to be consistent and exist throughout all your channels and all elements of your business.

And don't think branding is something you don't need. It's ESPECIALLY important when dropshipping because you're at a HUGE disadvantage (long shipping times, unreliable suppliers, etc.). So the only advantage you can really have is through branding and by standing out from the crowd in some way.

Anyway, I know I'm just ranting at this point but it's so frustrating to lurk on this subreddit and see all these people asking to rate their stores only to see that their stores are UTTER and ABSOLUTE CRAP (I mean, I guess that's a plus for me since it means less competition in the whole eCommerce space, but still... it gives us eCommerce brahs a bad name in the long run).

So yeah. Focus on da branding brehzzzzzzzzz",5,30,2017-12-14,ECOM,0.03339248150587082,0.9284812211990356,0.03812628239393234

ecommerce,Newbie: Would Like to Add ECommerce Site To Existing Enterprise Business App,"Hello Reddit,

My company makes customer experience software for utilities which allows a utility customer to manage nearly any aspect of their relationship with their utility provider. Many of our customers offer rebates to their own customers if they purchase energy efficient equipment (think NEST thermostat, low-flow shower head, etc.) and we would like to make it easier for customers to purchase these goods by incorporating an ecommerce ""Marketplace"" into our existing platform. 


We do not expect the sale of these goods to be a major source of revenue for us, although, admittedly, I would definitely like to monetize this somehow and make a few bucks off it. Now, I might be getting greedy, but I do not want to deal with purchasing inventory, warehousing, or any part of the logistics. We want to let somebody who is a professional and knows what they are doing handle it so the end-user has a seamless experience, but we want our branding and styling to provide a consistent UI/ UX. 


Can anyone provide a good starting point or suggestions on how we could accomplish this? Is there a white-label Amazon marketplace available or an amazon affiliate marketplace? Or anything similar?


I appreciate any insight and suggestions you, the ecommerce Gods, can provide!

Inspiring product images
Effective product images stimulate a customer's imagination and inspire them to buy your product. Evaluate your image quality based on these guidelines:

The image matches the product description in size, color, and so on.
The product is recognizable.
The image is a photo and not a drawing.
The photo is taken at a flattering angle.
The product is focused and well-lit.
Close-up shots are not obscured by highlights or shadows.
The product occupies at least 80% of the image area.
The entire product is depicted in the image.
Backgrounds are simple and clean so as not to distract from the product.
In addition to providing quality product images, provide as many different images as possible. Many product categories allow for the inclusion of swatch images and alternate images.

I recently launched my new Shopify store, aiming to sell watches. I've set up and ran Facebook ads and was just wondering what the most optimal country is to run these ads.

I've tried running PPE ads targeted towards 18-35 year old men in the United States, but all I found was just Mexicans interacting with the post (likes) and that's just the extent of it. Barely any website visits. Thought I could be wasting my resources here.

ecommerce,How to Launch an Ecommerce Business Abroad and Earn More,"The legal aspects

Any ecommerce project is based on internet acquiring – a service by which a business operating online can accept payments, usually from an end user’s payment card. Given how easy it has now become to incorporate virtually any company in virtually any jurisdiction, the corporate structure should be built around acquiring.

What does this mean?

“From a lawyer’s point of view, the structure of a company (legal entity) is a tool with a specific function. When creating a corporate structure for any business, a lawyer selects and uses solutions that enable the business to perform efficiently and grow.

“Mistakes made when incorporating a company can cost dearly and prevent the business from selling its services abroad by restricting its acquiring tools. At best, the merchant will be unable to open an account and he will go and incorporate a new company in a suitable jurisdiction with the required structure. At worst, the merchant’s company will be accepted, but the service will come with higher commissions and the company could lose money for several years.”

Choosing a jurisdiction and restrictions on acquiring

A jurisdiction (in simple terms) is a country or territory with its own legal system. For example, Hong Kong, various US states and some special economic zones in the UAE are all jurisdictions. Companies are incorporated in a jurisdiction on the basis of its regulations. By choosing a jurisdiction you are simultaneously choosing where the company will be incorporated and what kind of company it will be.

Choosing the right jurisdiction is both an important start and half the battle

The choice of jurisdiction influences which banks will be able to provide acquiring services for transactions. This is because the laws of various countries and the rules of individual payment systems restrict the acquiring bank’s ability to work with foreign companies. Thus, acquirers from the EU can only serve companies incorporated in the EU, and American banks predominantly serve businesses incorporated in the US. So a company incorporated in Hong Kong will simply be unable to work directly with a European acquiring bank.

Payments cannot be made from a merchant account in the same way as they are from a settlement account: a merchant account can only be used to accumulate funds received from credit cards. To gain access to funds in a merchant account they have to be transferred to a settlement account. This usually happens once a week.

In addition, whereas in the past a company could open a merchant account in the EU and a current account outside the EU, the rules in this area have now been tightened up. European acquirers can only make payments to settlement accounts within the EU.

Before incorporating a company it is important to analyse the structure of the traffic to understand where the main customer flow is from and to take this into account when choosing an acquiring partner.

The company (corporate structure) is chosen to fit the type of acquirer. But an acquirer also has to be chosen. This choice is driven by the nature of the business: where your clients are and where the traffic and payments will come from.

For example, if a business mainly serves users in the USA, an acquirer in the USA or Canada should be selected. If an American user tries to make a card payment to a merchant account opened in the EU it is likely that his transaction will be blocked by the risk departments of his issuing bank.

European acquiring has a high success rate for transactions within the region. For example, if somebody in France buys something via a website with acquiring in France, the issuing banks will have no issues with the transaction as there is nothing suspicious about a Frenchman buying something in a French shop. But if the acquiring is provided by, for instance, a Chinese, American, Hong Kong or any other bank that is exotic for the European region, the issuing bank’s risk department may consider the transaction suspect and block it.

Risk assessment

Every acquirer specializes in specific types of business in which it knows how to assess the risks and can decide whether or not it is willing to serve a company.

Some businesses carry fewer risks, and some more. It is harder for companies working in more high-risk sectors to find an acquiring bank. For example, if a company sells dietary supplements online it will not be able simply to go to any bank and apply to open a merchant account. The acquirer will refuse, simply because it lacks the competence to assess the extent of risk associated with serving that customer. The merchant, therefore, needs to find a bank that specializes in its type of business.

Company management

Banks place even more rigorous demands on company management.

For instance, an acquirer from the EU will open a merchant account only if the company is formally and actually managed by a resident of the European Union. He or she must not be a nominal director nor work for another 100 companies. If the bank comes across any such information it will reject the company. A director must be professional – in other words, unique.

Furthermore, VISA and MasterCard have de facto “nominee blacklists” (VMAS for VISA and MATCH for Master Card). If it turns out that one of a “nominee’s” companies is engaged in gambling under the guise of a drapery shop, its account will be closed and the director and principal owner will be added to the blacklist. Almost automatically, merchant accounts can then be closed for other clients who have used the services of the “nominee”, even if they haven’t broken the rules of the bank and associations, together with the company’s accounts with other acquirers.

The shareholder structure is also important.

Acquirers are also more understanding if the shareholders of an American company are US residents and those of a European company are EU residents.

Structuring the business

Where a group of companies is concerned, for the business to function normally it needs to be divided into several legal entities and correctly structured, with a division of responsibilities and risks.

There are particular aspects to the structuring of an IT business connected, amongst other things, with the way acquiring works. To properly structure such a business you need to specialize specifically in the IT sphere.

This is a mistake that frequently affects clients who apply to law firms with little knowledge of the specifics of international structuring, or – and sometimes the consequences of this can be even worse – to law firms that specialize in structuring other sectors of the economy, such as international trade in grain. Such companies may even realize their mistake but continue leading their clients along to keep the businesses.

In addition, even if an IT business is not working with acquiring at this stage, it still doesn’t mean that it can be structured like any industrial holding. IT structures really do have many specific features: from the predominance of offshore jurisdictions for handling relations with investors to resolving issues around safety and interaction with multitudes of self-employed programmers in Ukraine.

Technical capability

Make sure that your acquirer has the technical capability to work with you.

Not all banks have sufficiently advanced technical systems. Even if a bank is suitable in terms of its legal and other characteristics, there is no guarantee that it will be able to service the company. Some financial institutions can perform acquiring, but they need processing and a payment gateway, while others perform only acquiring. This means that a settlement account, without which you won’t be able to start processing either, will have to be opened somewhere else. They then work with other companies or recommend them to the client.

So where do you start?

There are some guidelines for anyone planning to open a company abroad and sell their services to foreign clients. When choosing a jurisdiction, start by analysing your traffic and the acquiring banks’ ability to work with your business. You can get help in choosing the right acquiring tools from specialists who spend all their time doing just that, as things in this areas are changing quickly, laws are being tightened up, and what was appropriate one month ago may not be the best choice today. Choose partners that specialize specifically in your field of business.",1,17,2017-12-18,ECOM,0.07691118121147156,0.8941815197467804,0.02890731394290924

shopify,What is Completely Missing,"Shopify is a great platform no doubt.  Their tech support is great, the system is intuitive and easy to use, and its relatively cheap.

What's missing is by a significant number jumping into online retailing is the simple fact they have no clue what it really is, what the environment is evolving to with the likes of Amazon etal, that it is a real business and takes a lot of work.

I think there is a huge opportunity to cater to and help this huge segment of store owners.  Things like business planning, finance, analytics use training, marketing, cash management, etc. could be offered to this group of store owners.  

I consult with a lot of store owners.  Its astounding what that they don't even know what they don't know.  

Platforms like Shopify made it incredibly easy to get online.  The vacuum is now putting a system together to offer business services in an efficient economical way.

I truly would like to do something like in developing a system to help people.  I see so much stress and worry because store owners feel doomed (a lot are).  

Shopify democratizes retailing and encourages small business development.  Ok, hope this wasn't too long of a post but looking for input and collaboration (I guess).",8,7,2017-12-21,ECOM,0.022172624245285988,0.9298940896987915,0.04793328791856766
ecommerce,How the heck do you rank with Walmart?,"Not too long ago we got a product line into not only Walmart.com but a few Walmart stores as well, and the category manager is saying that they'll look at Walmart.com sales as well when considering whether or not they're going to expand our store count.

So like it or not we have to pay attention to Walmart.com; the thing is I have no idea how the keyword ranking works. When you look at the big keywords in my category, the top listings (where you'd see the sponsored listings in amazon) is dominated by about a dozen listings with ""Clearance"" or ""Rollback"" badges on them, and when you look at the top listings after that, #1 ~ #10 has 0 ~ 10 reviews, and there the rest of the front page is the same, with half a dozen with 30~40 reviews. The only exception is a listing at #6~7 that has a whopping 10,000 plus reviews! (which is outranked by listings with 0~10 reviews) This is the result from major keywords in my category.

Customers add items to their cart as in a normal shop. When they go to check out, if they enter a shipping address that we do *not* offer shipping to, then the ""continue"" button becomes a ""request a quote"" button. Once they have completed the request a quote form, the contents of their cart will be sent to us as a quote. However, if they enter a shipping address that we *do* ship to, they will be allowed to check out and submit payment normally, with no quote involved.

Some more details:

-if the customer decides to make a purchase based on a quote, they don't need to finish the transaction in woocommerce. The client is happy to finish the process by phone, email, whatever.

-plugin price is not really an issue but the price of custom backend development would probably be high enough to be an issue

ecommerce,2 months preparation. Anxious to start. Ready to work hard,"First of all, this isn't really leading up to a question; writing this is mainly for my own benefit. There might be some interesting replies, who knows?

About 2 months ago I started reading and watching videos about e-commerce. Some videos promised £50,000 per month after less than a year. I wasn't born yesterday... I knew that this was just business, and that some degree of success was there for those willing to put in the hard work.

Told a friend about what I'd been reading and he was intrigued. He agreed to become business partners. The next couple weeks were very enjoyable, but it did feel like we were kids 'playing at business.' That quickly turned to real in depth market research, number crunching and devising a legitimate business plan. After no small amount of work (in my opinion at least), our first product is going to launch in January.

If there is a point to all of this, I suppose it is this: to reaffirm why I'm doing this. I do not expect to get rich quick (if at all). I do not expect to work less than an hour a day. If my salary and work hours were the same as a 9-5, that wouldn't matter to me. What matters to me is that I don't want to work for someone else, doing work that is not rewarding in any way. I want independence and a chance to succeed or fail based on my own merit.  

I can honestly say that, although I have a plan, I still have no real idea what life will throw my way in 2018. But after the last few years, I feel ready for just about anything.

Think I'll take my mind off this and enjoy Christmas for a few days. Looking forward to reading any replies though! Peace out :)",5,9,2017-12-23,ECOM,0.028031032532453537,0.9172279238700867,0.054740987718105316

ecommerce,Looking for accounting software Ecommerce business,"Hi,

I run an ecommerce business (Ebay, Amazon, Shopify, Fruugo, etc.) and I am looking for an accounting software. At the moment I am a small business just under the VAT threshold (based in UK). Soon planning to register for VAT and form a Limited company.

These are the features I was thinking about having:
- Integration with Ebay/Amazon/Shopify/…
- Forecast inventory: Predicting how fast my stock will run out based on past selling performance
- Not only general accounting, but also analytical accounting and management accounting


Are these features farfetched and unnecessary? Yes, at this moment I am small, but I want the fundaments and internal information systems to be strong. Why?
1. There will be no issues when expanding as the information systems are strong
2. It will help me decide on how, when and how to expand as I can decide that through management accounting
3. It gives me financial reports and based on that I can see which products are performing well, which aren’t, what the profit margin of each is, how long my stock has been sitting, how long it will take to sell the stock, financial predictions, etc.

The 4 ‘best’ accounting softwares I have seen so far are: Sage One, Kashflow, Quickbooks and Xero.

Budget range wise I would say I am willing to get something that costs me more if the software is really good.

So my question is what do you recommend? What did you decide to go with? 

I would appreciate some advice, thank you!",14,15,2017-12-26,ECOM,0.01799125038087368,0.9150390625,0.06696963310241699

VIDEO Form: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1w7Qcj7baA&amp;feature=youtu.be

I have the afternoon off of work today and I'm bored, so I thought I'd try to add a little value to this sub.

* First, some proof: https://imgur.com/a/CpVNl
* Second, I have no blog, no email list, no course to sell you. You will not find a single link to any of those things in this post.
The only thing I will keep reminding you of is to check out the video form of this post as it is a lot more detailed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1w7Qcj7baA&amp;feature=youtu.be

A little background: My name is Eddy and I'm 17. I've been dabbling with online stores for close to 3 years now as a way to add a little ""side-hustle"" income to my main job (another affiliate website). The earnings for the screen shot you see above are from a single store, the only store that I currently run. The site is less than a two months old and consistently does a few thousand a week already. My expenses consist of the Shopify Premium plan, graphic designers, and many apps, an expert photographer in my niche who I pay about $600-$700 per month (he's a superstar). So on average, depending on the week, we're talking about $5,200-$9,200/week in pure profit, doing about 5-10 hours of work per week. Here's the gist of what I do: enter a very broad niche (let's say, ""fitness""), and upload many winning products from Aliexpress to fill my site with Example: 1) Popular womens leggings, and 2) Popular Workout shaker bottles. This is nothing groundbreaking: it's pretty much what every dropshipping website recommends doing. Go on Aliexpress and search different keywords by ""order"" and you'll see all the products with the most demand.

Watch the Vid if you're still confused: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1w7Qcj7baA&amp;feature=youtu.be

There is nothing complicated about this content. You all shop your favorite sites/blogs every single day, and you've seen this type of online stores on the internet a thousand times! The trick is, it has to be high-quality. Exceptional quality, with high-quality pictures, good customer service, everything. If you can find (or hire a VA) winning content and products, then you're in business.

The second half of the coin is your apps and getting Instagram influencers to work with you.

I'm not going to write an entire guide on how to get influencers, but I recommend checking out a video I made. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeIdWYNBogA) to learn best practices on how to do outreach to influencers in your niche to pick up some traffic. Some of the best apps I've found the most success with (Google them): are urgency count down timer apps, email captures, sales popups, funnels, reviews, and a few others that I cover in my video.

I've built messed around with close to 100, low key and high key apps to get where I am today. That may sound like a lot, but it's not that many. The key is: keep messing around, keep trying to see which apps work the best for your website and audience. Then, over time, your content will start to rank high in Google due to the quality of your content and quality of your traffic. Your ""shaker bottle"" will rank on page 1, people searching for that query on Google will land on your site, click your product link, and you'll start earning some money.

So in short, if you can do these three things:

* pick a broad enough niche that appeals to a lot of people and which offers lots of physical products for sale (think: health, beauty, fitness, pets)
* find extremely high-quality products + quality content (pics, service, etc.)
* learn how to work with influencers and know which type of audience works the best with your products, and also which apps work the best with your website. 
Then you should be on your way to earning a decent side-hustle income. Any questions about my strategies (NOT about my site, which of course I will not be revealing), feel free to ask. P.S. While I only work 5-10 hours on the site now, getting this all up and running from the ground-up on Day 1 was a LOT of work and required about $500 in start-up costs (which all went to my graphic designers, SEO optimizer; that number can be close to $0 if you are tech savvy enough to do all of that yourself).

Anyway! What strategy works well for you to start to gain momentum on a business Instagram? We are currently just under 100 followers but we know that more followers/awareness will generate more leads to making sales.

We have redeemed a free $30 voucher that Facebook has given us as well as put a couple of dollars a day into Instagram advertisement.

dropship,Made my 50th Sale. Lessons from my Dropshipping Journey so Far.,"What's up /dropship! 

Back in October I read a dropshipping journey online. This kid reached nearly 10k revenue per day. I always wanted an online business, and the concept of shipping directly from the producer to consumer (foregoing storage and extra re-shipping costs) was too appealing to pass up. 

Fast forward to today, and I made my 50th sale. I'm running at a minuscule profit, less than a dollar a day. My main - and only - profit generating method is FB advertising. The only reason I'm bothering with the extremely low profit yielding ads is to keep my Pixel firing and learning. 

**In fact, I'm running into the same problem with every campaign/product. On a $5-10 per day budget, I'm getting two sales/day after the initial couple of days. After that, the CPR rises and the conversions taper off to one, and eventually none per day. Keep in mind, I'm not raising the budget, so why is the CPR rising?**

I've learned a tremendous amount in the last two months. I'd love to share my knowledge with anyone who's just starting out. So if anyone has any questions, shoot! I'd also love to find a group or mentor who I can exchange ideas about Dropshipping + Shoppify. Unfortunately, this subreddit is flooded with YT tutorials and not a lot of substance. 

I was in school full time, but now I'm on break so I can concentrate fully on my Shopify store.

I've been trying to piece together snippets of code from StackOverflow, but I'm not sure if I'm doing anything right. 

Just a few of the questions I have:

* Should I be using WooCommerce sessions? 
* Can I set the country, state, and postal code for the checkout by defining the customer details (with the sample code below), or do I need to set it by a filter/function that will change the default fields according to the session? 

&gt;  $customer = new WC_Customer();

&gt;  $customer-&gt;set_billing_postcode($postcode);

* I haven't been able to verify that anything works for the country and state fields, and I'm worried that it's because they're both dropdowns. When I started, I tried using PHP sessions and the code below would return an empty array when I dumped the session variables. Is it correct to leave off the single quotes when it's a dropdown?

&gt;  $_SESSION['shipping_state'] = $_POST[calc_shipping_state];

&gt;  $_SESSION['shipping_country'] = $_POST[calc_shipping_country];

&gt;  $_SESSION['shipping_postcode'] = $_POST['calc_shipping_postcode'];

* Would it be correct to use PHP/WooCommerce sessions or should I do it dirty with cookies or URL parameters?
* TL;DR: How would you do this?

ecommerce,How should I market my idea? (Currently frenzied and lacking direction),"Hello! I've always had a love for making things and business. I've recently decided to meld the two, and have an Etsy shop, a Facebook page, an Instagram and a Youtube channel. I also have a Shopify website which I have not yet launched.

A few months ago I bought a CNC router and began experimenting with wood. I designed and made a set of desktop speakers which I think look and sound fantastic. The USP of my business is that I put a lot of thought into the design process that's overlooked today, and I make things using slow, careful crafting techniques in-house as opposed to having things cheaply made overseas.

I plan on adding additional products - these could be anything from phone holders to wedding ring boxes - anything. Each product will have strong design principles at its core and will be made using the CNC router and hand finishing techniques.

I am currently frenzied and don't know how to market this. The most similar company I can think of is Grovemade. I'm not sure exactly how I'd describe what I make as a general rule. I have virtually zero cash to invest further in this project so I'm really struggling with how I'd promote this.

I should also mention that I took a punt at a Kickstarter campaign with a video showing the process of myself making the speakers, and that generated absolutely nothing.

Can anyone advise?

Thanks!",4,2,2017-12-30,ECOM,0.02161964774131775,0.9320687055587769,0.04631170630455017

dropship,Why 99% of You Will Fail With Shopify..,"Hi /r/dropship/

I wanted to take some time out of my night to create a quick post that might help out some struggling store owners. I've started my store a few months ago and it's been a crazy ride. I realized that the success I've had with my stores aren't that typical. After my last post, I've gotten a lot of people asking for me to review their Shopify store. I took a look at a few of them but honestly, 90% of them had the same continuous mistake. Let's get right into it.

Here's everything in video form: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dqGRDgJ5e0
I highly recommend you both watch the video and read this post for full insight. 

Number 1. Understand that if drop shipping was easy, everyone would be doing it. Shopify isn't easy, and stop expecting huge results so quickly. In most cases, stores takes months or even years until they really blow up. If you're fortunate enough, you might pick up some golden products and utilize all aspects of marketing perfectly, and your store will blow up quickly. 

Only a small % of shopify stores are truly successful in the long term. Yeah, some stores may have a little spike here and there in sales but that's nothing to get hyped over. Spikes are normal. But the more important question to ask yourself, is your store optimized for a long-term business? Will it be making consistent sales for years to come?

Number 2. WAY too many stores are going into saturated niches along with overused products. People see success with stores such as MVMT, Lord Timepieces, Fashion Nova, with their watch lines and apparel stores, so they try to replicate it. The thing is, pretty much 90% of shopify stores are watch/apparel stores/bracelet/accessories (you get the message) store. Step out of your comfort zone and start a store no one else hasn't or at least don't go into a such populated niche, UNLESS you're a pro at marketing and know how to run successful online stores obviously. 

Number 3. You import too many products that don't relate to each other, you need to keep a theme. As you look at these successful shopify stores, you see that they all have their own style and theme. Their products all serve a meaning and are not just there because they saw a bunch of good reviews on aliexpress. 

Number 4. You're not utilizing Instagram influencers, but if you are, picking the wrong audience. People make the mistake of starting on Facebook ads first. The thing with starting out on facebook ads first is that you have nothing to go off of. You're paying $5 or however much a day to market towards an audience that you don't even know will like your product or not. So set up a pixel, get out an Instagram influencer ad, and with the sales, you get from that, your pixel will become super smart and know the audience that your product attracts. Then with the pixel, create a custom audience and retarget a facebook ad towards that audience. If you're still confused, check out this vid where I go into more detail. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dqGRDgJ5e0

Number 5. Not utilizing apps - urgency, killer deals, check out. Basically, you're not doing your research on apps. If you're not willing to spend time on researching which apps are out there to help bring you sales, just quit. Apps are a huge part of stores. Look for apps that add urgency. Have a killer deal using discount codes. Also look for apps that make your checkout page more user-friendly and welcoming. 

Number 6. No creativity - same themes, images, no logos, store name. Simple, everyone's using the same images from aliexpress and themes from Shopify. Stand out and use something different. 

Number 7. Leaving titles, description and themes the same. Again, self-explanatory. When you import your products from Ali, edit them in oberlo and make everyone look better. Get rid of the stores logo and everything else that may make your picture less professional. 

Number 8. Marketing. The thing with marketing is that most shopify store owners have no clue what they're doing. Do some research, take a course, or get a mentor who can guide you on how to market your store or products.

Number 9. Giving up too early. This is the biggest reason. People nowadays are too spoiled and impatient. Don't give up if you don't get sales for a week. It's normal, some stores don't get sales for months. Just keep at it. We all are fortunate enough to run an online store virtually without having any inventory. How can you complain? Don't give up but instead, see what you're doing wrong and try your best to fix it.

I'll be open to do some store reviews, just shoot me a message with your store asking what I should look over. 
** IT'D BE HELPFUL if you send over some information first before asking me to review your store. As another post on reddit said, send over your stats for the last 30 days so we can see what you need to work on. 

	* Average Daily Traffic
	* Bounce Rate
	* Conversion Rate
	* Abandoned Cart Value
	* Average Product Value
	* Average # of items per Order
	* % New Visitors
	* % New Customers
	* Duration between repeat purchases
	* % discounts given to total sales


That's all I got for today's post. Hope this gave you a little insight on why stores fail so quickly. Thanks guys.

dropship,Best way to pay for 100 products of same item going to 100 different addresses in one payment (Aliexpress).,"Okay so I have a question that nobody has been able to answer as of yet.

I'm pretty much set to press go on my campaigns.. website is ready.. I just have one issue.

What is the best way to actually process and pay for, a bulk order of 100 units of the same product going to different addresses?

I'm dropshipping from Aliexpress and need to figure out a way to purchase these 100 orders in a manner which won't alarm my credit card company that something is up.

If my credit card company sees 100 10 dollar purchases and will look like fraud and they will temporarily cancel my card for sure. It is not within normal consumer behaviour to act in this way.

If anyone has any idea on how to get around this.. Please please please let me know.

I've heard of things like sending Excel spreadsheets to the seller but that would be in breach of data protection laws.

I'm sure someone out there has an answer!

TLDR;
Trying to process 100 orders of the same product to 100 different people through Aliexpress and avoid having to pay 10 dollars 100 times as this will look like credit card fraud to my cc company. Also for the sake of convenience. 

I'd much rather pay 1000 dollars in one go, rather than 10 dollars 100 times.",12,6,2017-12-31,ECOM,0.06897292286157608,0.9086690545082092,0.022358030080795288
