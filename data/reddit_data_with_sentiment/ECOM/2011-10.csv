ecommerce,Ecommerce website specification document,"Hi reddit,

I'm looking into my first ecommerce website, in the business of retailing clothing accessories.

Does anyone have a generic specification document for a retail website.
I've been burnt before during the website design process so I want to get everything involved down to a T, or as close as so the developer/designer is aware of what we want inside out.

Would appreciate any advice. Cheers :)",2,6,2011-10-07,ECOM,0.017623983323574066,0.9194841980934143,0.06289184093475342

ecommerce,eCommerce - I need some advice! (x-post from /r/business),"I’m in a bit of a unique situation. I work at a local small business (selling specialized sporting goods) that does the majority of its sales online (although we do have an actual brick and mortar store). I have been an employee here for two years and have performed a range of services, the most notable of which are improving and maintaining our online presence, as well as performing search engine optimization in congruence with other marketing techniques.

However, the business has just been sold. This is a positive for me, as the previous owner was not only very reluctant to change and adaptation, but he was not particularly wise with his financial decisions. Because of this, I did not have much authority and my suggestions were sort of thrown by the wayside, although they were valid suggestions on ways of improving the business.

I should note that the new owner has left the every day business side of things (in the brick and mortar store and online) up to myself and another employee. Therefore, the most pressing issue is changing the eCommerce platform that we are currently on (Yahoo Merchant Store… yuck). I am looking at a number of different systems, most notably, OpenCart, PrestaShop, and Magento. Although I am very familiar with Wordpress and its related eCommerce plugins, I do not feel that it is appropriate for a store of this magnitude. Anyways, as a relatively successful web designer, there aren’t really any technical limitations in front of me. To be honest, having never actually set up an eCommerce store in preparation for actual sales, what are some of the problems I’m bound to face?

I’ll get to the point here: What are some of the things that I should know about the business side of eCommerce (merchant accounts, shipping rates, taxes, etc) and/or where can I go to read up on more of this? Do you have any suggestions on things I should know or things you wish you would have known before setting up an eCommerce store? Also, if you have a preferred eCommerce system, please feel free to share. Thank you, everyone!

ecommerce,Looking for a London/UK based web designer for an e-commerce platform,"I'm looking for a web designer to theme and provide basic configuration for an ecommerce platform for my new internet retail company.

I'd like the designer to have a decent portfolio available where I would be able to get references. I have a pretty detailed requirements specification available to get started. Logo and complimentary pattern have already been designed.

I'll require a contract, defining the full quote, payment structures, estimated delivery time and deliverable dates.

It would be preferable to have the designer based in London and I would like to meet. I'm working with a tight budget but I am open to quotes.

Thank you.",0,1,2011-10-17,ECOM,0.02450842410326004,0.933415412902832,0.04207611829042435
