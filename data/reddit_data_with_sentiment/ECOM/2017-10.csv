I launched my choker and custom jewelry business about a week ago and so far the traffic has been extremely slow through Facebook ads (I know it's only been a week, obviously no sales) I use Wix's SEO and my website is enabled on Google and Bing search.

ecommerce,Best Payment Processor For My Situation?,"Hey guys


basically I'm trying to find out what my best option is for receiving payments from the USA to the UK. My product is about $100 and not many will be sold, maybe 10. It's a very low key operation at the moment with just myself involved. I've already figured out the shipping. Now I'm just left researching potential payment processors. I've read PayPal's international fees are much higher than others, such as Stripe, but most people do have PayPal accounts so it's very convenient. Now with Stripe though, I'm not sure whether the customer actually needs an account too, to make a payment, and if they do I'd see this as a bit of a turn-off. I've also read a little bit about TransferWise but I'm even less able to wrap my mind around whether or not the customer needs an account with them. 


So really what I'm trying to figure out is: where is the place where I can get the best international fees, that is also the easiest to use with customers on a one-to-one basis?

Step 1. Have a business plan. If you're going to invest your time and money into a project, actually have a business plan. Determine who your competitors are, determine who your customer is, determine the route of future growth. Having a plan will help you better price your products, it will help you guide your marketing budget, and it will allow you to determine if your business is growing or failing.

Step 2. Have access to capital. There's an old saying that says, ""you need to have money to make money"". I'm not saying that you need to have a ton of money, but having access to money will allow you to weather the storm. You see it all the time on this sub, ""I spent $50 on AdWords this month, no sales and now I'm broke"" or ""I can't afford to use any e-commerce solution other than the cheapest Shopify has to offer"". If a $50 loss is going to break your back or if you can't afford to spend more than $30/month on your storefront -- go back to Step 1 and reevaluate your business.

... going to lunch, to be continued. 

... back from lunch.

Step 3. Understand where you fall in the distribution line. If somebody is supplying you products without terms or a contract, they're either selling that product to many, many other resellers or you're overpaying for it. If you're overpaying for it, you're not going to be able to sell at a competitive price and your product will either not sell or it will sell at a very tight margin. If your supplier is selling to many other resellers, your pricing strategy will inevitably be a race to the bottom. There will always be a seller willing to make a penny, dime, or dollar less than you and competing on price will diminish your profits.

Step 4. Refine your e-commerce site. Don't look at your site as the seller, look at your site as the buyer. If you're using an e-commerce template right out of the box, your site is going to look like some type of Russian scam. You need to tweak and customize the style of your site, you need to add contact information so that the buyer knows that you're legitimate, you need to add product and category content so that the buyer trusts you as a reseller of that product, and for godsakes, remove 404s. If you're using an out-of-the-box e-commerce template, the least you can do is go through it and remove links to pages that you're not using.

Step 5. Sell products that you're either knowledgeable with or passionate about. Just because somebody will supply you a product, doesn't mean that you should sell that product. To take revenue, and profits, to the next level, you're going to need to have content on your site and you're going to need to answer customer questions. If your product knowledge doesn't extend beyond what's listed on the data feed that your supplier gave you, you're going to come off as unreputable and your bottom line will reflect that. Use your products, hold your products, read about your products and comparable brands, read about the industry that your products are in and the industry your products are manufactured for, become an expert of the products that you sell. 

I'm going to cut it off there. If you want to start an e-commerce site, you owe it to yourself to take these 5 steps or don't waste your time with e-commerce.",61,96.0,2017-10-06,ECOM,0.04357752948999405,0.925304114818573,0.031118351966142654

woocommerce,"Need help! Input ammount, output USD?","Hello all. First time poster here but I need some advice and have done a lot of research and can't find what I'm looking for so let me explain.

I have a site that runs on Divi theme. My site is basically done, has my user login and other features and the design is done.. Except for basically the bulk of the site.

What is need is a calculator similar to the one found here: https://www.arcusgold.com/cheap-rs-2007-runescape-gold/buy-rs-2007-gold

For those who will not click the link, it's basically a box that you type in the ammount of an item you want, and it displays a USD ammount in the next box. Then, you can press ""Buy"" or ""checkout"" and it will then remember the number you entered, carry over the USD it will cost, and then allow you to checkout....

I need to add this same concept to my existing website. The main pages have some boxes I added using Divi theme visual builder that allows me to type on them, but they do nothing. I also have a button with custom CSS that says ""exchange""..

Is there a way that I can modify these boxes I added to allow for a formula or something to where users can enter the ammount of my product, then it's USD equivalent will appear in the next box, and then they can press the box that says ""exchange"" (which also has customs CSS along with the Two boxes where you enter the ammount). And then they are brought to checkout?

Is there a plugin for this? Is there code I can add to the boxes i placed using divi? Is there any other plugin I can use to accomplish this?

woocommerce,Retail Ground option not showing up,"Hi all, I've tried searching for the answer to this, and all I found are a bunch of dead-end threads posted by people that experienced the same problem that I am. 

My site isn't showing Retail Ground as one of the options at Checkout. It does show up if and only if one uses the shipping cost estimator on the Cart page, and only then will it show up in the Checkout page. However, if one navigates directly to the Checkout page without using the estimator, Retail Ground does not show up as an option.

I am using the USPS shipping settings provided by WooCommerce Services. I do have Retail Ground selected in the details. All of the other shipping options I've selected in the same menu, i.e. First Class and Priority Mail, show up without any problems. It's just Retail Ground that doesn't show up unless someone bothers to use the estimator first.

dropship,"I feel like there's a bunch to be done, but I'm looking for the most immediate thing I should be working on, any help is much appreciated","Hello dropship community,

I've been on and off dropshipping for a while now as I was working jobs and other miscellaneous projects, but after learning about some of the latest tools available to streamline the process, I've come back to give it another college try. 

I've had a fair amount of success dropshipping on eBay before a bit a laziness crept up and a week of neglect got my account suspended. So I started a shopify store this time in order to minimze the percentages going out per sale so I may be able to automate a working model this time. However, things are slow to start.

The website is www.toonshowshirts.com and I've been up for about a month now, I've driven ~ 440 people with a cost per view product @ $0.23, so some interest is definitely there. There's an average of about 20 unique visitors a day, and I could get more if I scale up the budget but I'm wondering if I should have gotten some conversions by now or not to understand if my ad/niche is working as I thought it to be.

My instagram presence is a fledgling right now, though I am trying to commit to a 1 post a day and an active follow and like spree within my audience category.

I understand that my branding is a bit weak as well but I'm not too sure how I would go about customizing my site with the budget I have for myself at this time (which is not very large at all).

Basically, the main question is, if you were in my position and understanding there's a lot to be done, what would be the first three things you would focus on completing or setting up? However, any and all help in turning sales would be much appreciated!

ecommerce,How are eCommerce stores doing accounting?,"I am trying to visualize what the ideal accounting setup would be for a business doing $1MM of sales per year with 100 SKUs, selling across multiple channels.  The ideal setup would give you visibility into margins across the channels, as well as overall margins.  E.G., a quarterly-type GAAP accounting so you can see COGs, fees, margins by channels etc.  

However, I can't figure out what software allows for this.  I will have a centralized inventory &amp; order manager, and they have a Xero integration -- but that is far away from calculating COGs etc.  

The only solution I am aware of is BrightPearl (who charge $20K/YR for a basic package of 1,000 orders/month, which is way above my budget) and Webgility (which will cost me an incremental $3K/year, as I won't use their platform for inventory management/order processing/multi-channel selling).  

What are the alternatives to BrightPearl/Webgility out there?  

I will be selling on Amazon FBA, FBM, my website, WalMart, Jet.com, and eBay.  So 6 channels with all 20 SKU being sold in each channel.

Is the cheaper option hiring a CPA?  Or am I looking at Webgility + a CPA?  Or is there another solution?

woocommerce,Linking a Java Convertor to WooCommerce checkout?,"hello all, I need some help/advice..

I have a website that uses a calculator/convertor that is a java script my buddy made. This script allows you to enter an amount of a product I want to sell in a box, and out comes a price in USD. The prices chnage reguarly, since it is a crypto currecny. Is there a way that I could like the amount of the product, as well as the price that is displayed in the calculator to a woo commerce checkout system after the user presses a ""buy"" button?

woocommerce,I'm looking for a flexible Genesis based theme for WC,"Hello friends,

Long time Genesis user here. I'm looking for a Genesis based child theme that sort of out of the box allows me to get a shop up and running that looks 'professional'. I currently use Envy Pro but I don't like the way how they force the big slider down my throat. The way the frontpage is widgetized is rather limited.

I really like the way estore pro and flatsome have their demo sites set up. It's very versatile and fits many designs. Most genesis based themes that support WC seems to be a bit outdated cq. doesn't seem to be as slick/versatile as the aforementioned ones.

Unfortunately time is rather limited and the site needs to be up and running asap, so making my own child theme is not an option for now. On the other hand I don't like to run a WP site without Genesis. 

Long story short: looking for a genesis child theme with native WC support that comes with a very versatile frontpage. And I hope with this post to find that special one that I missed out on through my many google adventures.

woocommerce,Need suggestion on shipping/pickup/delivery addon(s),"Hi all!

We've done lots of reading and testing of different addons that play well with WooCommerce but haven't found anything that ticks all the boxes yet. We're also a bit reluctant to just buy a bunch of addons that may or may not work together, so trying to ask here for some help :)

So, what we're looking for is a solution to handle the following 

* Delivery method selection on checkout based on product shipping class (shippable / not shippable)
* For all non-shippable products, we need the ability to choose between delivery and pickup
* We also need to be able to configure when deliveries are available (including lead-time and max number of deliveries pr. day)
* Similarly, we need to be able to limit when pickups are available, also including lead-time

Do I have to start reading up on writing addons myself or have any of you tried to tackle a similar scenario before?

ecommerce,"Yet another E-commerce amateur - seeking for opinions, feedbacks, support","Hey e-commerce subreddit fam,

Yeah, you read that right. Yet another amateur trying to start their very first e-commerce website and trying to make it to the market - what a cliché. But let me explain my story.

Last week, I launched my very first e-commerce store specializing in men's accessories and style. Whilst scrolling on Facebook, I stumbled upon an article from Oberlo, explaining the whole idea of dropshipping, the logistics behind it and its potential through the help of social media. Coupled with my passion for men's fashion and style, I decided to give this project a go. If everything fails, I can at least tell myself that I've tried, give myself a pat in the back for stepping outside my comfort zone in terms of what I'd normally do and my capabilities, and learn from my failures.

Fast forward a week and here we are now, with a fully-functional website up and running. I've spent the past week doing research, reading articles, blogs, e-books, Youtube videos and came up with a rough business plan and a plan of action. It was hours upon hours of commitment and I was getting tired, but I didn't want to stop there. I also wanted to make my website as visually captivating as possible to leave a good initial and long-lasting impression, and outsource my products from a supplier that was both reliable and guaranteed to be able to make quality products. As such, I was selective with the products I decided to import. All is well and good right now apart from the ad campaigns, which is the stage I'm currently at. I want to reach out to all you redditors for support and seek advice from those who've experienced it all regarding the strategies/procedures of the campaigns and what the most effective ones might be. I understand the importance of patience, but I feel that in order to have that mentality I need to know that what I'm doing is the most effective plan of action. Thus far, I've learnt and did everything on my own. If there's anything you'd like to add that would be considered constructive (which can be beyond the limits/topic of ad campaigns) feel free to share.

shopify,Internationalizing Shopify,"Some of you may be interested by translating your Shopify in other languages to reach a larger audience and then more sales. Especially if you have a dropshipping business.

From my experience with Shopify, you need to have three things in mind before making your Shopify global :

-Who are you ? If you are a regular Shopify business selling physical goods, your internationalization will depend on your strategy. Do you provide international delivery ? Are your customers willing to pay for international delivery ? If the answer is yes, you can consider internationalizing your Shopify, but in the other case, It is not time to consider it. 
If you are a dropshipping business, of course this issue does not exist, and you are free to internationalize as you want. 

-Use analytics to choose where to internationalize and choose the new languages of your website. Google Analytics is a good way to do it, you can see the principal languages of your users here. 

-Know the cultural differences between you and your audience and be careful. Don't hurt the feelings of your foreign audience, and you may have to get professional translation to be sure to not create any misunderstandings. 

Also I wrote a blog post [""How to Create Value to your Audience by Internationalizing""](http://blog.weglot.com/create-value-audience-internationalizing/) which is more detailed. Do you have any feedbacks for me ? :) And can you share us your own advices to internationalize a Shopify ?

Been looking to narrow down a niche lately and have noticed one thing in my pursuit of ecommerce: there is so much CONTENT out there, that it's hard to decide where to spend my time learning.

Now that I have a few hustles up and running, I thought of making a review website for the different business resources I've used, discussing their pros and cons and whether they're worth using. For example, good blogs to/not follow, podcasts, email lists, etc.

Two questions:

1) would you/your entrepreneur friends be interested in something like this that curates sources of ecommerce information

2) is it a wise business decision, meaning can it be monetized down the road? (not looking to get rich quick, but ultimately don't want to spend thousands of hours for no return). I can see affiliate links coming into play for some of the product or service reviews, etc.

woocommerce,Looking for shipping plugin functionality similar to Amazon Pantry,"Hi,

I am in the process of setting up a new shop whereby I am going to be selling products that will be shipped in a fixed size box - fresh produce.

My shipper will be Royal Mail and I see that there is a Woocommerce plugin that provides functionality to determine shipping cost when checking out.

I'd really like to be able to work like Amazon Pantry does to inform the customer what percentage of their box is filled and perhaps even suggest products that they could use to fill it.

Is there some plugin that can provide this functionality?

dropship,I want to start a dropshipping Business in Germany,"Hey everyone!

I am 19 years old and live in Germany, and I am really interested in starting a dropshipping business. I have already spent a lot of time gathering information about the whole process and I feel like I am ready to give it a try. 
However there is only one problem that I can't really figure out. Since all these guys on YouTube (my main source for information) seem to be from the USA, they obviously only tell you how to start a dropshipping business in the states. 

The problem:
I just can't decide which way is the best for the business I want to start:
1. German online Shop and products imported from       AliExpress (long shipping times from china to Germany)
2. German online Shop and products imported from other sites like dx.com (only aliexpress is compatible with Shopify and oberlo)
3. English online shop for American market and products imported from AliExpress (American market seems to be oversaturated plus I don't know if that's legal if my business is located in Germany)

dropship,I want to drop my wholesale accounts and open up my artisanal USA made product catalogue to drop shippers. Fully automated fulfillment set up. Is this possible?,"I started a business selling my handmade leather products about 20 years ago (yikes!). Right around 2002 I started selling on the internet. We do ok with our branded products, but I'm looking to harness the power of ecommerce and I'm not a marketer - I'm a leather worker. 

For a relatively old guy in this space, our business is decently automated and has seen an uptick since heritage is trendy again. Orders come into our website, they're passed through to our fulfillment company, fulfillment packs and ships sends tracking to the customer. All we do is make our items and send stock to fulfillment. 

While reading a lot about drop shipping to get a grasp on Facebook advertising for my own business, I had an idea. What if we dropped our wholesale accounts and opened up our business to drop shippers? We'd simply require our wholesale price ($50 for bifolds, $30 for belts, bracelets range from $5-20) before shipping the order. 

I noticed everyone usually goes with AliExpress. We would offer a completely hand made product that is both made in the US and ships from the US. We'd simply make our catalogue of pieces without logos - using Shopify, it'd be as easy as plugging our custom key code into the affiliate store and orders would pass right through and be fulfilled in 12-24 hours. Folks could brand their store however they'd like, and we staff a professional photographer that can provide lots of beautiful images. 

I'm posting to gauge interest. Do you think our products would work in the current market? And would this be something you'd be interested in?

shopify,"Using ""Ellipsis Human Presence"" to thwart these account-creation bots? Or, another option perhaps?","firstly: as far as I can tell, the fraudulent accounts aren't actually causing us any issues, other than flooding our customer list and distressing my manager / business owner. I can export the list, edit it with idk an Excel macro or the basic Java file-parsing skills I have from my failed CompSci degree, but we both know I'm not staying with this company forever, so I'd like a solution that will work even when there's no ""tech person"" working here.

We recently switched to Shopify away from our Drupal-based previous site (which was an ancient-looking, typo-filled disaster-and-a-half, tbh) and we were hoping that with that switch would come a respite from the bots that love to create fraudulent accounts with us and then never log in again ... unfortunately, no such luck. So the manager has been trying to keep up with going in and deleting them here and there, but he's doing it manually and it takes a lot of time and energy and makes him constantly stress about how we're GOING TO BE HACKED ERMAGERD, and I know he already deleted *my* account once by accident and I don't want him deleting legitimate customer accounts too. *Side note: the accounts are REALLY easy to distinguish, they always have 100% nonsense ""names"" and the first and last names are always the same. (Examples: ""jodygy11 jodygy11"", ""Drywallfkb Drywallfkb"", ""Wirelessxet Wirelessxet"", etc.) All I have to do is find all entries where those two parameters are identical, and delete those entries.* But again, with about 2-5 accounts created EVERY hour and the constant potential for fat-fingering the selection ticks, this is something that I'd really like to be automated, and my manager just can't/won't periodically export/run an Excel macro/reimport (and I don't want him to, either, haha).

We don't have a *huge* budget, and it seems like a lot of the apps on the store just give you some HTML captcha fields to add to the account signup page. But those types of fields just aren't working for us -- I'm not *super* web savvy but from what I can find on the Googles, it looks like our little friends are using some kind of injection (??right word??) to basically fool the page into thinking it's already accepted whatever entries are given. So we need something a little more sophisticated.

I can't find anything that works by deleting the accounts after creation, so although it seems to be a valid option, I just don't have the mechanics behind it to make that work. If anyone has a recommendation for that, I'm listening.

Otherwise, we'd like to prevent these accounts being made entirely (which hopefully will also send the message to the bot creators that, you know, whatever you're trying to do, it ain't gonna work here). This app ""Ellipsis Human Presence"" seems to offer more advanced bot detection, and specifically mentions filtering account creation attempts without any detriment to legitimate human customers, which is nice. So we added the app, created an account, and we're now logged in to them on the Shopify dashboard -- but it looks like we have to create our own scripts here?? [Screenshot.](https://i.imgur.com/9I0GvLx.png) Well the whole reason we went with Shopify over other options is because *no one here really knows HTML* (I mean, I figured out enough to do shit like add a &lt;div&gt; containing our Return Policy to our footer strip, but starting from scratch on an input-restriction project where I don't even know the parameters available to manipulate? Y'all trippin.), let alone Shopify's neat-but-confusing .liquid platform, so this isn't going to work, and definitely not before this 14-day free trial runs out.

Any advice? Has anyone worked with this app or this publisher before? Do you have any HTML advice or templates or tutorials you can give me or link me to (remember, all I need to really do is filter these account-creation bots either by their botlike activity and/or by the fact that their first and last names are the same) to get these ""VitalForms"" working? The reviews on the app seemed to think it was SUPER easy to get it all going, but I know it can't be as easy as just installing the app because we haven't had any slowdown in account creation since installing, and I contacted the publisher through their main site last week and haven't heard back from them at all.

Thanks for any assistance you can give!

#TL;DR: these damn spam bots keep making accounts for no reason. Easy to identify, but not easy to get rid of them via automation so far. Ellipsis Human Presence app claims to be able to restrict account creation, but apparently requires us to write our own ""VitalForm"" in HTML or .liquid -- we don't know enough about that to get it working at all.

woocommerce,Listing products on shop page by categories without overwriting template files,"I'm trying to display products by categories on the main shop page. Basically I'm trying to do:

    **HOODIES**

dropship,"3[My experience] Social media Marketing strategy Using Instagram, FB page, Pinterest and Youtube","Here I will share with you my experience if you have time to read it 😁 Social media Marketing strategy Using Instagram, FB page, Pinterest and Youtube : I want to talk here about a wonderful tactic that I use and still using, and that bring me sales and conversion

1) When you have an e-commerce business you should create related social media accounts at all existing platforms. The most important of them, which I use: Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, Youtube. The most of my traffic come from Instagram, I will show you how to do that, don’t worry.

2) You should animate your accounts by adding videos and photos with some text and CTAs (call to action). In general, good posts help you bring a lot of sales, always use HQ photos and videos. If you can’t do that use Fiverr to get that kind of services videos/photos editing for 5$.

3) Now, you have created your accounts and photos and videos are posted, the next step to tell people that you are on social media: by using follow/follow back system and like and comment to other people that probably can by your products/services, there are a lot of robot that can help you do this automatically. Here some bot program that can help:
NinjaPinner and NinjaGram (for pinterest and instagram) 
Followliker ( I use this one because he works for all)

But before starting follows and likes or comments, your accounts should have some followers and some likes and views that you could buy. I will give you the link to a website when you can buy followers, likes… this tactic push people to trust your promotion, because it's look popular an famous…then they follow you and like your posts and most of them will click to visit your e-commerce website, then they start buying from you. I use this website to buy followers likes views …etc there are a lot on the internet but for me I trust this one: http://socialcheap.univerhome.com/

ecommerce,Starting out with a general store or niche store?,"Hi guys, I've been in the eCommerce space for a little while now but just recently started getting into drop shipping. 

When first starting out is it better to have a general store or niche store? Here are my pros and cons, let me know what you all think works best.

General store:
Pros
- broader range of products allow early stage flexibility
 - One can use this method until they find out which products work best then specialize into a niche

Cons
- Lacks store cohesiveness and can look a bit random to customers. Lacks any brand identity and therefore trust that a niche site would have.

Niche site;
Pros
- Greater congruency and customer alignment
- Greater trust

Cons
- Less flexible
- Hard to know if it's the right niche to be targeting

dropship,Payment Gateway Advice,"Hey /r/dropship

First of all - a huge thank you to anyone who decides to comment and share some of their knowledge.

I started dropshipping a week ago selling vaporizers. My website used a PayPal checkout button to handle all payments. Fast-forward one week and I am permanently banned from PayPal(did not know vaporizers were a no-no for them) and now I am at a loss on how to handle my payments from here. (Don't worry - im not losing money by not having a checkout system up or anything, my site is not busy)

My questions are the following:

1. I don't have a business or LLC(I'm In Canada) - are there any payment gateways that will let me sign up without a business/tax ID? I have no problem proving my identity through SIN or Drivers License etc - but I am not a registered business.

2. I've heard about Payment Aggregators - is there any well known ones that you can recommend or should I stay away in general?

3. Should I just register a business? I know nothing about the process of registering a LLC in Canada - is this pretty easy to do? Can it be done online? And most importantly how long does it take to do? 1 month? I feel like registering a business is the right move here - so please let me know.

I've done some research and it seems like 2checkout doesn't require business ID but it does a 3rd party redirect which in my opinion kills conversions...

Also Stripe says in their terms of conditions that dropshipping is prohibited

So I am an illustrator and I found some opportunities for printing on merch with my illustrations. It's all print on demand and dropship so I don't have to worry about stocking inventory and what not.

The shop has been up for about 3 weeks now and I've only made 1 sale, it was a close friend of mine. But there has been some traffic to it from social media and whatnot.

I am trying to only advertise through profits, so I get that things should be slow at the start. My question though is if I have any glaring mistakes already and that's why nothing is happening?

**1.** Is it that I don't have enough product variation?

**2.** Do the products just suck?

**3.** Is not having an about &amp; faq page killing off potential conversions?

**4.** Is it unrealistic to expect my minimal traffic to be converting already? 

**5.** Do people see the website name and just run?

3 weeks in and this is causing me quite a bit of anxiety. I don't have any faqs yet, so I didn't put anything in there.

ecommerce,"2k visitors, 10k impressions from ads, and social media presence is growing steadily - but NO SALES?!","I recently (around a month ago) started an online jewelry store using Shopify and sourcing products from China and fulfilling by dropshipping. The store sells jewelry ranging from $9.95 to $49.95. I currently am only selling women’s jewelry, but I have plans (and hope) to expand to men’s jewelry and fashion accessories in the future. So here’s what I’ve done:

 I have spent many full days on the store’s front end to make it look professional and trustworthy, watches hours of videos and reading near a hundred articles/blogs on how to increase the trust factor. I’ve taken the time to change my product descriptions to something that doesn’t look like the scammy copy/paste sites, and I only use decent quality images and high-res when available. 

I’ve run multiple test orders and tested every part of the site to make sure it functions as intended. I’ve filled out all the pages that a legit business would have, including shipping, contact us, about us, etc.  

I’ve been advertising on FB via ad campaigns, and Instagram using shoutouts (I’ll not do the latter much until I can spend time on finding more relevant influencers). I’ve watched countless videos and gone through so many tutorials about how to write and create ads for FB and they seem to be rather successful in terms of post engagement and visibility. My relevancy score is 9-10 on every ad so I know my target audience is accurate. Most of the ads cost me $0.08 for a post engagement. Ive tried video ads, picture post ads, carousel style picture ads, and even Instagram post shoutouts by influencers in the industry. I’ve tried targeting between 250k and 800k potential reach on ad sets and found I get the most exposure around 400k.  I’ve run well over 20 ad sets, and most of them much more than $5-10 per day, so I DO understand the $5/day bullshit is garbage and won’t do me any favors.  I’ve spent well over $400 in ads on FB alone. I let ads run 

After making over 10k impressions to over 9300 unique users, getting almost 2k visitors actually hitting my home page or product pages, gaining 600+ followers on Instagram, getting 450 likes and 60 shares/tags on FB...NO SALES. 

I understand this could definitely be the products I’ve chosen as they might not be that one “hot” or “golden” product. I’m still continuing to test more products and add more to the store every other day or so. I also understand that I’m not building this business for fast cash and definitely have a vision for where I’d like to go with it in terms of growth and expansion. I’d just like to figure out why I’m not converting. Not even once. 

Help, please! Any advice, stories from experience, and general resources of GOOD information would be greatly appreciated.

shopify,Dropshipping Tutorial - What is Drop-Shipping?,"Dropshipping Tutorial - What is Drop-Shipping?

Drop Shipping is a very popular business model, whereby somebody sets up an online e-commerce store on Shopify but doesn't actually hold any products in stock and it doesn't require lot of money in order to start to drop ship.

This is great for working remotely and online as you can manage your store from anywhere. 

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about running a dropshipping business.  

Instead, the drop shipper acts as an intermediary between the customer and the product manufacturer or distributor.  so you do don't have to pay the manufacturer or the supplier first in order to start participating in dropshipping business.

Drop Shipping has become a popular business model over the past decade and entrepreneurs are still exploiting this opportunity today.

With the internet and online marketing ever evolving, Drop Shipping has become more challenging than ever and today requires significantly more effort and resources than it did a few years back. 

In this video, I discuss why I think people really need to understand what drop shipping. 

I also discuss why drop shipping is a viable business model and who should pursue this type of online business.

I know there are many of you who are starting Drop Shipping stores so let's start a discussion in the comments below.

It doesn’t need to have nearly the amount of options that there are with the vista print but more than one option would be nice.

dropship,"My dropshipping journey from $0 to $1200 in 17 days, finally succeeded on my fourth store.","This case study is mainly to encourage those who might be thinking of giving up. After trying to do a store for months and failing, I hired someone to do them for me, non the less she succeeded. Understanding what I was doing wrong was the problem. But I kept at it until about 17 days ago when I broke the code.

having someone do something for you and it succeeds, doesn't make you feel so nice, getting something done yourself and it succeed, that feeling is unbeatable. I have been very successful online with FB ads, I have had great success with Affiliate marketing, but drop-shipping wasn't just working. But it has finally worked.

This is my newest store, but as many of you might notice, I am totally blown away by the results.
The store has gotten 60% of the sales from social, 30% from organic search(Even though I did not do any SEO on it...which even shocks me the most) and the rest from referrals.

I have run a maximum of $250 in ads only, and done a lot more of manual organic sharing and the like. I am planning on scaling the ads to say $200 a day. 
Lessons learned, until your pixel is properly seasoned, organic traffic converts a lot better than FB. we were getting a 4.9% conversion before starting on FB traffic, and that number reduced to 1.8%

2-Follow the simple steps. 
a) Have the right mindset(Spend more time on products and marketing, than you spend on anything else; Don't give in, keep trying until you succeed) 
b) Create a store and brand it
c)Pick a market/Niche and get at least 10 products day to it. If you do this consistently for a month, that will be 300 products! am sure a lot has already been said about product picking and selection, unless you need my own criteria, I will leave it at that,
d)Market Market Market Market....do everything, if you dont have money for facebook ads, you will pay with your time. Here is what my schedule looked like

-FB Groups
-Email
-PPC
-SEO
-FB Ads and IG Shoutouts
-Pinterest

Below I detail my experience with my first sales.

Note: I am using Alidropship plugin instead of shopify ( because of the monthly apps fee though)


With this plugin i save a lot of time since I only had to deal with finding the product that worked and the method I was going to use to market. (Facebook Ads)

shopify,3 Quick Possible Answers Why You're Not Making Money With Your Store,"There are many reasons why you're not making real money with your online store. 

Read here for 3 common reasons (they are easy to fix):

If your website has less than 2,000 real visits per day, a bounce rate of 50% or higher, or a conversion rate less than 2%, face it: you own a hobby, not a business. And that's okay if that's your goal. There's absolutely nothing wrong with running a hobby as a pastime.

But if your aim is to develop your store into a profitable business, read on.

Let's start simple:
If you have poor traffic (less than 2,000 visits per day every day), your site is basically unknown.

You likely need brand awareness and brand exposure.

Tinkering with the site or doing anything else that doesn't expose your brand to the public, at this point, will not help sales. 

No Traffic = No Sales

You need a comprehensive marketing program. 

If you have a bounce rate higher than 50%:
One reason maybe your marketing is reaching the wrong people. I've seen business is pay experts to generate traffic with the traffic ending up being computer-generated. In other words, fake traffic. Look for traffic coming from a particular geographic area like Asheville or Boden. 

Don't pay for fake traffic.

If you have a conversion rate less than 2%:
A 2% conversion rate means you get 2 actual sale transactions out of every 100 site visits. 2% is the minimum you are shooting for, so not getting that can mean your customer value proposition is not working. Are you now asking what that means? Okay…

Value Proposition = The Total Product Presentation To The Customer
- The product itself (is it any good?)
- Price( including tax and shipping)
- Is delivery fast and easy
- Is your site pleasant and easy to be on

Don't get defensive about your store or product. It doesn't matter what you like... It only matters what your customer likes.

Some other indicators you may need to tweak your marketing:
- Do you have a large abandoned cart value?
- Have you researched your competitor's offerings?
- Have you simply asked your visitors why they don't buy from you? 

Lastly, here’s a list of some of the metrics we often analyze to reveal a lot of information why you’re not getting traffic or sales:

Average Daily Traffic	Bounce Rate	                Conversion Rate
Abandoned Cart Value	Average Product Value	Average # Items / Sale
% New Visitors	        % New Customers	        Repeat Cust Duration
Discounts as a % of Sales		

We trend these metrics on a 7 day, month, 3 month and YTD time periods and compare to prior periods. If the trends are not positive (trending upward), its a signal you need to change something.",2,4.0,2017-10-28,ECOM,0.03383898735046387,0.9200521111488342,0.04610889405012131

woocommerce,"How to add a ""Backordered"" badge?","First off, sorry if this is not the right place to post this if this isn't allowed please point me in the best place to ask this please. 


I currently have a custom theme which offers up a badge for ""Out of Stock"". I'd like to also duplicate that badge for ""Backordered"" items as well. 

I've checked the usual places for plugins to do this, but no luck. 

I've done some digging and this is the code checking if the product is available and adding the badge:

        &lt;?php if (!$product-&gt;is_in_stock()) : ?&gt;
            &lt;span class=""out_of_stock_badge onsale""&gt;&lt;?php echo esc_html__(""Out of Stock"", ""tech-life""); ?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;            
        &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;

It looks like woocommerce offers an alternative method of getting the stock through [WC_Product::get_availability\(\);](http://woocommerce.wp-a2z.org/oik_api/wc_productget_availability/) 

My thought is to edit the above snippit to check availability 
 with this function instead of is_in_stock and have a badge be created based on what that function returns. 

Am I off on what I want to do? And if not, is there a common resource somewhere that one can put a bounty on small snippets of code like this? Unfortunately I don't know how to write this up based on this function.

woocommerce,[ADVANCED] Who can help me debug a product issue ? (long thread),"I started my store about a year ago and I was on a tight budget. I counted my stock, named all the products and created all the required attributes and their respective values.

I used WP All Import to bulk import all my products using an excel sheet. My products are variable, but since WP All Import only supported Simple Products, I imported them like that.

Then I used WooCommerce Advanced Bulk Edit from CodeCanyon to convert them to variable products, and then I proceeded to create the variations and enter the stock.

Since then I usually either manually add new inventory. Or I use the WooCommerce Advanced Bulk Edit plugin to add them.

This is always been working fine. All the products are showing up and can be ordered. But a few months ago I discovered an issue and it seems to be targeting only the products I bulk imported using WP All Import and then later on converted.

So a few months ago I purchased the WooCommerce Product Filter plugin. I set everything up correctly and I can use the filter just fine for attributes like color, brand, material, etc.

But I cannot seem to filter by size, which is used for the variations.

I noticed that filtering for size seems to work for the products I've added manually or through the bulk edit plugin. ONLY the products that I've imported initially using WP All Import aren't filtering properly. All products seem to appear, even the ones that aren't available in the selected size.

Now after updating another one of my plugins (WooCommerce POS), which acts as a cash register app, it too does not 'see' products anymore that were imported. Just the manually added products appear.

In short, there's some difference in the products that were bulk imported, then converted (from simple to variable) and the products I added manually or added through the bulk edit plugin.

I exported both Products and Variations using the built-in Exporter in WordPress and I compared the data. I cannot see a difference that can cause the issue I am having though. There are some meta fields present in one and not the other, but nothing that relates to stock or availability and such. I did notice however that the 'problem products' have a line in the data which seems odd: `&lt;category domain=""product_visibility"" nicename=""outofstock""&gt;&lt;![CDATA[outofstock]]&gt;&lt;/category&gt;`

I did some digging in the database and found the term that was assigned to this variation and was able to remove it. It did not fix the problem though :(

I've spoken to the developer of the Bulk Edit plugin, the developer of the Product Filter plugin and also with Mike Jolley through email without any results.

So I am hoping someone here is willing to help me out!",4,2.0,2017-10-29,ECOM,0.08801005035638809,0.8843164443969727,0.027673538774251938

shopify,Seeking Marketing Help for my New Store,"Hello,

First post here on reddit

I have done everything I am physically able to do up to this point for my shopify website. I have now hit a roadblock with how to approach marketing. I was thinking about using adwords and facebook primarily but I would have no idea where to even start. I have accounts for all of these avenues but before I start spending my marketing dollars I want to make sure I am not throwing money into the wind. Basically I am looking for a mentor to help me get my site on peoples computer screens and start converting. If you think you can possibly help me with this dilemma please send me a PM",7,2.0,2017-10-30,ECOM,0.023997711017727852,0.9161303639411926,0.05987194925546646
shopify,I started thanking my Shopify customers and it changed my business,"First time poster!
I've never really used Reddit but I was scrolling through this subreddit and wanted to share something that really helped my business grow.
In my store I made phone number required (even when it was optional I was still getting like 75% completion rate), so I started calling up any custgomer who spent more than $50. I would just call within 24 hours and just say ""Thank You"" - no strings attached.
I just said my thanks, I told them I appreciated their business and their trust in my business, and they should reach out if they have any problems of any other questions, or need anything at all from me.
At first I was afraid to call, but I had recently read Ryan Holiday's book ""The Obstacle is the Way"" and I knew that I should make the phone calls because that was what my fear was - and that I should start moving closer to my fear, not away from it.
Lo and behold, it was awesome. People loved that the owner of the store was calling them - many of them would end up thanking me! 
The results from the call was a visible increase in repurchases, and then I'd get emails from other people those customers referred. So I know for a fact it helped me increase my sales.
If anyone has questions I'm happy to answer :)",19,29.0,2017-10-31,ECOM,0.030476605519652367,0.904066801071167,0.06545655429363251
dropship,A PSA about Shopify Payments and Reserves for Dropshipping Sites,"Hello Dropship community,
I wasn't sure where to turn to with the information I've gathered over the course of the past week in regards to Shopify Payments and more specifically the reserves they take on dropshipping businesses, but I thought Reddit would be a good start. I am hoping that any one in this community who uses Shopify as their choice platform for dropshipping will consider not using Shopify Payments after hearing this.

A bit of context: My business, Forward Solutions, have been Shopify Partners since January 2017. We have created countless dropshipping sites on their platform for clients, have sold starter sites on Flippa, and have also operated numerous stores on their platform. Since April 2017, we have operated 4 separate dropshipping stores, each selling different products. The first site was a fidget toy store that we operated for 2 weeks and later flipped. We received an email from Shopify's Risk Operations team about a reserve being set on our store of 15%. The reasoning behind this was that dropshipping has a higher risk of chargebacks. This made sense to us since we know a lot of people who operate sites choose the cheapest shipping method, don't care about customer service, and don't ensure that customers get their products in a timely fashion. Prior to selling the site, we spoke to a handful of Shopify Guru's and Risk Analysts about having the reserves paid out to us prior to selling the site on the slight chance that we wouldn't receive the funds after the payout bank account changed. After 2 days, Shopify agreed to pay out the reserves with no issue and we had our money.

Fast forward to August (we took a break for a new venture) and we opened and operated a new store. This site sold enamel pins and once again we received an email about reserves. Nothing out of the ordinary, the generic response about chargebacks and a 15% reserve. Once again we explained about situation and Shopify said that they could lower the reserve to 10%. We didn't get them removed, but nonetheless lowered so that we had enough margin to be profitable right away and continue fulfilling orders in a timely fashion. In August we ran another site that sold Magnetic Cubes and same story: email about a reserve of 15%, except this time they wouldn't budge on the % of funds taken.

Now this is where it gets confusing. After selling both those stores in August, we opened up a new store selling winter accessories. We expected the standard reserve email but this time it was a shocking 25%. Considering the majority of dropshipping businesses operate on thin margins already, taking a 25% reserve leaves you with scraps plus enough money to fulfill orders if you're lucky. After countless emails back and forth with 3 different Risk Analysts, I've now come across some shocking information, to us at least.

I always wondered what Shopify did the reserves that were taken but mainly do they sit in an interest bearing account? Well I got my answer today. Section C-11 of their Shopify Payments TOS states:
""You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the funds held in the Reserve Account, that you have no right to direct that account, that you have no legal interest in those funds or that account and that you may not assign any interest in those funds or that account.""
You can say that maybe we should have done our due diligence and read through the TOS prior to using Shopify Payments as our Payment processor, but let's be honest, how many people actually sit there and read through the TOS for anything? So, not only could Shopify not give me an explanation as to why a reserve of 25% was set on our site or change it, when in the past they clearly have the ability to do so, but now I'm completely aware that this massive company takes a portion of our hard earned sales and makes interest on it while we sit patiently for 90 FUCKING DAYS to receive that money. If Shopify wasn't the core of our business, we would not hesitate to switch platforms. Now knowing what they do, we've applied for a 3rd Party Payment Processor to avoid these reserves completely and hope that with this information more people follow suit.

To be clear, I love Shopify. It's easy to use, simple to transfer over stores to someone who has no background in e-commerce, a fluid system for ordering and the Oberlo app to assist with making dropshipping easy, but coming across this has completely ruined my opinion on Shopify as a company. They claim to want to help everyone start their very own business, however taking 25% of a business' sales isn't much help to anyone. I completely understand the need for reserves, but within limitations. I would also find it more acceptable if they weren't claiming interest on our reserves, or at the very least pay out that interest to us.

Hopefully this information opens everyone's eyes to what goes on in the background of a massive business like Shopify and the shady and unethical practices they operate under.

shopify,Help setting up a local shopify theme development environment?,"Hey, I'm wondering if anyone can help me with setting up a local shopify theme development environment. My employer has shopify plus, and has about 5 different stores for different locations which all use the same theme.  
   
My current process doesn't seem very smooth, I'm used to working locally and pushing to a beta/development server using git, which can then be push to a live site again using git. Particularly when publishing the changes live, across 5 sites, I feel like I'm setting myself up for error.  
  
Basically, my process is:   
1. pull latest changes (Sourcetree/bitbucket)  
2. Work on theme locally (Motifmate)  
3. Synchronize to test in editor of the live site (Motifmate)  
4. push to backup (manually pushing just for the sake of verison control) (Sourcetree/bitbucket)  
5. Publish for go live (Motifmate)  
6. Download theme, upload manually to other sites (shopify)  
  
I'd really appreciate any advice or links for. I have found it hard to get reliable information on this topic as Shopify makes big changes all the time.  
The greatest help would be a straight bullet point list as I have done, and if you can mention the software you use then I can do the research myself on how to set it up.
