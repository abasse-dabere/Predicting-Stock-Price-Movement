dropship,Dropship hybrid business.. any experience?,"Hi there - I am in the development stages of an ecommerce business, it seems like drop shipping may be a good fit for some of the products, but just wanted to drop it here and see if this is making sense.

I will be working with a small paper party decor factory out of Mexico who makes a lot of hand made to order party goods. Since I imagine a large portion of the business will be made to order/custom orders, drop shipping seems like it would make the most sense (I am in MX now, but the business will be based out of the US). 

I would also like to do  non custom designs as well - these I would keep in stock in the US. Shipping from Mexico to other countries is expensive, so this way I can do a bulk shipment from MX to the states, and have inventory on hand. It would require more labor on my part, but the margins are large so it is worth it. Plus I want to have some affordable options in the store that can ship quickly and low cost to the consumer. 

My questions are as follows:

Does anyone here have experience drop shipping custom/artisan/made to order products?

Any platforms you recommend? Etsy seems the most obvious choice to me.

A typical order could cost $25-$40 to ship from MX to US/Canada. Do you recommend building this cost into the pricing? Charging a flat fee? Or buyer pays full shipping?

Anyone have experience transporting from MX to USA, what have you found to be most reasonable shipping method? I have met a few people who will drive packages to the border, but not sure how sustainable this is long term.

dropship,Instagram Influencer Shoutout for Shopify General Store,"Someone suggested that because: (1) my ad budget for my general Shopify store is low and (2) my first three FB WC campaigns were expensive but went very poorly that: I should try using Instagram shoutouts to get some sales and build some self-confidence in my own store.

I watched a YouTube video which instructed:

1. Find a handful of pages related to my product.  Each page should have at least 20k followers.

2. Check each page for engagement

3. Message each influencer asking the rate for a single 12-hour shoutout.

4. Choose one or more influencers from the best of the results.

I have a general store.  I want to advertise a dog carrying bag that I am selling for $35.99 with free shipping to e-packet countries.

Here are my questions: 

. Will this plan work? 

. How much will an influncer likely charge for a 12 hour shoutout?  (Is $25-$50 reasonable?)

. Is all the influencer needs from me is a single product image?  If so, can the product image be a high resolution product image from the AliExpress product page? 

. How many landing page views can I expect from a shoutout? (Is 25-100 a reasonable expectation?)

. What is the conversion rate likely to be from the shoutout? (Is 2% - 4% a reasonable expectation?)

. How many sales can I expect from the shoutout?  (Is 4 sales of this $35.99 product a reasonable expectation?) 

. I know shoutouts work well for fashion and beauty, but how about products in the pet niche?

. I am confused on the following point: What I want is that when the user clicks on the shoutout they are taken to the product page on my Shopify store.  But, the YouTube video seemed to suggest that the shoutout will take them to the Instagram page for my store.  The video said that I should first prepare my Instagram page (which currently has 0 followers and 0 posts) by (1) making 5-20 posts, (2) spending $100 for fake followers and fake enagement on those posts.  I do not like this idea, but I do not have any followers.  Can I avoid this by having the user go directly to the product page or will I need to first build my Instagram page, whether organically or by spending $100, before shoutouts will work for me?

I am sorry that this message is so long and has so many questions.  Please help me if you can.  Thank you!",6,12,2019-08-04,ECOM,0.048533812165260315,0.9247996807098389,0.026666538789868355
shopify,A Shopify App to schedule holiday marketing campaigns,"Hi everyone, I recently released a new Shopify app called [Calendify](https://apps.shopify.com/calendify) which allows merchants to **automate the holiday marketing routines** by reducing all holiday sales plans to a few steps.

## About the idea

I got this idea while helping my friend who operated the online store and by the way experienced a headache when it comes to scheduling holiday sales and tracking of holiday events.

I was really surprised that every merchant has its own implementation of holiday marketing schedules. They target the same holidays but some people use the excel tables or google docs alternatives to make it work, others just concentrate on 2-3 events per year but miss other opportunities to boost sales.

At that moment, my only question was, **why is there no easier way to set up your campaigns to get the most out of the holidays**? This question was answered when I've built a solution that solved the local problem of my friend and now it would be really interesting to try to help everybody who experiences the same pain.

## What's inside

[Calendify](https://apps.shopify.com/calendify) is made the way that you **simply set it up once by picking the dates from the complete list of prepared holidays and let the app work for you**. No need to manually set up your sale coupons for every occasion or manage excel tables or other types of ""holiday schedule"" documents. It might be too loud, but I expect that you will get the **""Holiday sales schedule has never been this easy""** feeling after using it.

It has tools to :

* Browse the available PR opportunities (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, World Mental Health Day and more than 100+ other holidays and keep adding them) (FREE)
* Create personal recurrent events (It is a great use case for shop anniversaries or other special days) (FREE)
* Schedule sales (FREE)
* Show the announcement bar during the holidays (FREE)
* Send emails to customers during the holidays (First 1000 emails are for free, but even after that they are cheaper than any other email marketing app in the store. Also, currently the main priority is to test the app idea, so **just write to me, tell that you are from the Reddit and I will provide 10k free letters**)

As I said, currently the main priority is to evaluate the idea in the Shopify apps marketplace, I am not interested in taking money for it if it does not help you in the first place.

Yes, thank you, it is great that you are in the last paragraph, it is almost all.

I just wanted to also let everybody know that **any feedback is more than appreciated**.

ecommerce,"Expensive purchase ($10,000+ per purchase) E-commerce strategy","I run a business that sells high end services to other businesses and plan on building a website around all the various options and configurations. I'd like to complete payment online to avoid a complicated checkout process, but I feel that there might be problems involving transaction limits on companies credit cards. I worry if I simply billed them and accepted a cheque that I'd be opening myself up to undue liability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Currently I see the following options:**

1. Hope that businesses (and the occasional individual) have generous enough transaction limits to cover these costs. I don't see this as a great option as I feel I could be missing out on certain customers. Even with a 50% deposit and 50% authorized I'd worry it would be too high.
2. Use a service like [SplitIt](https://www.splitit.com/) or [PayBright](https://paybright.com/) to allow customers to pay over a series of months. This seems somewhat viable, but I don't really know the ramifications of doing something like this. What if a customer stops paying or cancels their card? I plan on doing further research but would love to hear about others experiences.
3. Offer clients to pay in 3 parts. One in the beginning of the engagement, one in the middle and one at the end. This seems fairly reasonable with regard to liability as we get to charge the complete value by the end of the project. Despite this, with services offered going up to $50,000, this could still be too high.

shopify,Interesting idea for a niche store,"Hi all,

Let me know what you think of this idea.

The store is called ""Half Pint Kitchen"" and it sells 12-20 products all centered around the theme of small kitchen living, such as RVs, boats, tiny homes, small studio apartments, hotels and guest rooms with kitchenettes, etc.

A lot of these space saving products people don't even know about. So you would just have to get them on an email list and notify them when you release a new product that folds, hides, transforms, etc. There is so much potential and you could eventually roll out categories for all kinds of stuff.

If it were me, I would find someone on a freelancer website and give them specific criteria for finding the products to choose. Then I'd ""build"" the site by installing the theme and pay a virtual assistant to load all the products up there. Then I'd look for someone building 'portfolio' stores and ask them to jazz me up a brand.

Does this spark any ideas? Any considerations with this strategy?

I am doing dropshipping since november, making sure I find products that solves problems, make sure they are not overdone and not extremely saturated ( handspinner for example ).
And this guy who I just met, a 13 yo who literally copied the 2017 dropshipping videos to the letter and made what 90% of dropshippers have done, aka a dog jewerly store, in 2019, and made almost 10 grand by simply paying for $50 shoutouts, and almost 8k profit, while I have never made even remotely that amount.
A simple shoutout with his product image, 0 text, and makes 8k. Really?
He put his site on sale and sold it for a grand and now the same guy who sold it is reselling it higher.

dropship,Facebook Ads Mistake that could cost you hundreds,"I have noticed recently that many people run Facebook ads without analyzing their results.

A small example... One of my students was running 12 different adsets and in each adset he was running 4 different ads. (Although I prefer to only run one ad in each adset, I think this is the best way to decide which ad is doing better.) After 3 days of running his ads and spending something around 400$ , he was very confused of what to do.  
I asked him to breakdown his results and figure out what performed best so in this way he could optimize his next adset.  
So for example, After breaking down the results. we noticed that: Male are interacting way better with his ads than females, his video ad is performing way better than the image, mobile viewers are interacting better than pc viewers and several similar things...  


So the next adset, he started to run was way optimized because he has already removed all what is not working!  


If you are running your ads without analyzing the results and just waiting for sales to come, most probably you will end up loosing your money! Use what Facebook Ads dashboard is providing for you!

ecommerce,Questions on Business Partnerships: What did you do?,"Hi all, new to eComm.  I'm currently in a mid-career transition, and I've decided to start an eComm business with a friend/former work colleague.  Aside from the operational aspects of running the business, I'd like to get feedback on the business-side of a business partnership.  Before my questions, a few things about us:

**Me:**

* Background: Sales, marketing, design, product, events, training
   * Current: Nothing, quit job/industry that no longer served me =)
   * Technical: Kinda, but not really.  Can read/write basic HTML/CSS, build Wordpress sites (Shopify/WooCommerce don't scare me)
   * eComm/Dropshipping: None (just videos of course)
* Time: Full time

**Biz Partner:**

* Background: Operations/logistics, various IT, eComm
   * Current: Pre-sales engineer for SaaS company
   * Technical: Yes, front-end with some back-end experience 
   * eComm/Dropshipping: Has experience, built store in past
* Time: Part-time investment (job that has flexibility; location independent so can be creative with time)

**We're both:**

* Hard workers and willing to grind it out
* Like to travel and both plan to be location independent (currently living in separate cities, me: LA and partner: travels for work)
* Both financially stable so we can invest in business for ads/resources (but of course be smart with money and not scale up monthly expenses, etc)

That said, here are my questions:

1. **How did you decide ownership % of business?**    
I've read certain articles at a 50/50 split is never the best idea.  Did you value experience vs time?  

2. **How do you handle finances?**  
Open to partners but one person is in charge of accounting?    

3. **How do you handle earnings/payout?**  
In the beginning, my partner will still be working and won't be in need of actual income from the business.  However this will be my main source of income so I'd like to receive salary/dividends (though I do have money saved and won't need the first dollar that comes through)  

4. **How do you handle sharing of credit card points?**    
I can imagine the point stack will be pretty tempting.  I'm a member of r/churning and r/awardtravel so know that I'll want points.  Do you treat it just like income and distribute it between partners regularly?  Is it a 1-1 or if we're doing a 60-40, you separate that ratio?  Do you let it sit?    

5. **How do you handle decisions?  Does someone have the ultimate say?**  
I'm inclined to split roles/responsibilities between us and the category owner gets to have final say for that part of the business.    

6. **Do you think it's super important for us to be in same city or can we always be location independent?**

shopify,Debug your theme without impacting your customers!,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share a quick trick I use for debugging production environments without having an impact on customers.

Let's say you're working on [https://myshop.com](https://myshop.com).  You want to test something, but you don't want it to impact your customers.  Add something unique to the querystring: [https://myshop.com?DEBUG1234](https://myshop.com?DEBUG1234).  There's no way your customers will visit that URL, so you can test what you want.

**In Javascript / Frontend**

If you're working with Javascript, you can test if you're in the ""debug mode"" as follows:

    if (window.location.href.indexOf('DEBUG1234') &gt; -1) {
      // we're in debug mode, customers won't run this code
    }

**In Liquid**

If you're working with Liquid (the templating language Shopify uses to render the HTML / Javascript), you can test as follows:

```
{%- capture header -%}{{ content_for_header }}{%- endcapture -%}
{% if header contains ""DEBUG1234"" %}
  {% comment %}we're in debug mode, customers won't run this code{% endcomment %}

Please add to this list. We need to blacklist the shit out of these people who are selling bullshit courses with generic info for thousands of dollars. When people google their names before signing up for a course, we want to show who's not worth their money in this list.

I've noticed lately that poor people are spending their savings on these courses. I really didn‚Äôt give a shit about these gurus until one of them implied that it‚Äôs ok drop out of high school and take their stupid course and become rich. Then I found out more than one of these guys made the claim that they dropped out of high school, and now they‚Äôre rich by following a few easy steps. That shit pisses me off, not their fake success but the fact that they‚Äôre directly manipulating kids into ruining their futures to make a quick buck out of them.

Just wish they would post a video of them researching a product, creating a Facebook ad copy, researching/targeting the proper audience, and daily login and sales of that item, going from 0 to $10k profits within a week with that audience, while not using more than $50 from their own pocket on ads (since you do need to spend your own money for initial ads).

dropship,Is a print on demand clothing store viable?,"Hello everybody,  I was seriously considering opening a print on demand clothing store selling mostly skirt and dresses, and dream of using it as a mean to start a ""luxury"" clothing brand in the future. This online shop would be selling garments like this ( so mostly skirt and dresses ).

 https://i.imgur.com/dXJxANx.jpg

And wouldn't be selling T shirts and other modern style garments. The ""luxury"" store would expand upon that to sell both traditional menswear (suits and all...) and womenswear. 

Whoever, this wishful thinking bubble of mine popped upon seeing the price that I would have to sell those garments at to make a profit. Indeed, I'd have to sell printful skirts $33 to make a mere $4 in profit for each item sold and that doesn't even factor in shipping, which adds an extra $5 to the total cost. I doubt anybody would buy skirts made of synthetic fabric at that price. 

This leads me to question the viability of one such store. 
Has anyone here experimented with this business model and did it work?

If not, I thought of a few solutions that could potentially work. 
I could temporarily forget the idea of selling my own designs and dropship existing designs. I'd also be selling jewellery alongside clothing in this shop. Once the business starts to make a profit, I could then reflect upon ways to sell my own designs.
I could also sell my own designs at a loss, but count on dropshipping jewellery on the same store to break even. If the brand gets popular enough, I could then try to find a way to have the dresses made in a factory to lower the production cost and therefore make a profit.
I could also set up a completely separate dropshipping store (probably a general store) and reinvest the profits into starting this clothing business.

Which one do you thing is the most viable solution?",13,9,2019-08-08,ECOM,0.038113683462142944,0.9055172801017761,0.05636902526021004

You can see my post history on this sub, where I really struggled as a beginner to generate even just one sale a day. In just 2 days however, I made all my money back, and have been profitable ever since.

**WHY WAS I LOSING SO MUCH MONEY**

1. No criteria in place for killing/scaling ad sets

In the beginning, I had no game plan whatsoever for killing/scaling ad sets. For example, I'd test a bunch of interests at $10 each, let them run for a day or two, and if they didn't get a sale, kill them immediately. I made no attempt to utilize other data, such as CPC, CTR, and CPM to make decisions on ad sets. As a result, my money would slowly bleed away each day, and because I was not scaling any profitable ad sets to compensate for the loss, I lost even more money each day.

I've been told that my own personal criteria for killing ad sets is way too early, but use whatever works for you and your budget. No matter what you decide, just have a game plan. Every time you go into your ads manager, know exactly how you're going to treat each ad set / campaign. Educate yourself on the different metrics that Facebook has to offer, and make each decisions with clear intention based on your own data. 

Perhaps my biggest mistake, was buying a course, and expecting that if I followed it to the T, I'd instantly find success drop shipping. Boy was I wrong. Every store is different, and there's no ""one size fits all"" strategy for ads. Yes, there are blueprints and basic foundations, but you have to make decisions based off of your own data, not someone else's. 

**WHAT CHANGED IN TWO DAYS ($1400 net)**

1. CBO Campaigns 
2. Killing Ad sets (aforementioned criteria)
3. Horizontal Scaling

I  fumigated my ads manager for all of the losing ad sets (anything below breakeven ROAS), and turned them all off. Next, I took my most profitable ad sets, and duplicated 10 of them into one CBO campaign, and the other 10 into another, at $200 each. After that, I did a 10 interest, $10 ad set testing campaign just testing a wide variety of angles. 

The results from that day, can be seen on my ""**Just hit my first 1k day with 40% profit!""** post here on this sub. The second day, I managed ad sets, launched another CBO campaign, and more test audiences, and broke $2k sales the very next day. The CBO's took care of themselves, and I was actually seeing pretty good returns from my audience testing campaign too. By horizontally scaling my test audiences, I was able to find winning ad sets quicker, and thus able to scale more aggressively via CBO. 

Over the next 18 days, I took the store to $43k in sales with about $8k net! 

Unfortunately, due to some issues with my ad account, I had to scale the store back down. Currently working on bringing it back up, but on the bright side it's done a little over $500 in organic sales in just the past few days. 

**KEY TAKEAWAYS** 

1. Kill and scale ad sets based off of your own criteria (ROAS, CPC, CTR, CPM, etc.)
2. Vertically scale winning ad sets via CBO or increasing Ad Set budgets (I personally only used CBO to vertically scale)
3. Test as many new ad sets as possible
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 

**WHAT I WISH I IMPROVED**

1. Testing New Ads
2. Testing New Ads
3. Testing New Ads
4. Testing New Ads 
5. Switching to a Sourcing Agent Sooner

In the attached photos, you can see where my daily sales numbers started to fall a bit. I attribute this entirely to ad fatigue, and my own failure to develop new ad creatives or get custom content made. All of the store's ads were made from low quality, AliExpress videos, and had I switched to custom content, or started testing new ads sooner, I probably could've scaled past $3k a day. Admittedly, I was naive and didn't consider the possibility of ad fatigue. Now, I've got custom high quality content made, and I've got a few variations of the creative ready to go at a moment's notice. 

Basically, **do not** overlook testing ads. 

My second mistake has to do with order fulfillment and the backend side of my store. At one point, I was doing 70 orders a day and manually fulfilling them via EPROLO. Not only did this cause headaches for customers due to the long shipping times, but also for myself dealing with all the angry customers who had problems with shipping.

Trust me, once you hit 20-30 orders a day, SWITCH TO A SOURCING AGENT ASAP. At scale, you do not want to be dealing with slow shipping times, and buggy tracking numbers. Save yourself the headaches, and make the switch when you can. 

\---

Alright, that concludes my short little case study here. Hope this can help some of you guys out there struggling to get your stores up and running profitably. My numbers aren't astonishing by any means, but hopefully you can take something away from this and apply it to your own stores. 

If you've got any questions or things I can improve on, leave a comment!

dropship,3 reasons that dropshipping start-ups fail,"Hello,

I've been consulting firms for a long time and most recently focused on dropshipping firms. While doing this, three particular reasons have almost always been the case to why most of them were failing. Please don't mistake this for self-promotion, I just want to give some insight into what the problems are and how to avoid them.

1. **Using a niche that is already severely saturated**

As dropshipping increases and increases in popularity, competition will become more fierce. This is always the case, no matter which market you are trying to enter. A couple of months ago, social media marketing was the main trend. It didn't take long until the internet was basically flooded with marketing agencies ran by people who didn't even understand the concept of SEO. Now, we have reached the same point with dropshipping. This means that every day, thousands of new stores are being created and the market gets more and more saturated. However, most new businesses tends to focus on the same niches. Some examples which have way more stores that potential customers are streetwear, jewellery and teeth whitening. This is without a doubt the number one reason why start-ups fail. If you want to sell items from one of these products group, you will face severe competition. Unless you have a unique selling point, something that makes your product special, it will be extremely tough to achieve a good market share. That is why you should put in a lot of effort on finding your perfect niche, something that isn't saturated but also has a lot of potential. Don't get me wrong, it is tough. When clients ask me to find a niche for them, I usually spend approximately two weeks analysing data and potential growth. This is so much more crucial than what most people think. If you start selling something that people rarely see, something new, you can have huge profit margins and still sell a lot.

2. **Focusing on short-term results**

With all these new gurus out there, pretending that you can get rich in a week, this is a very easy trap to get stuck in. To be honest, with the correct research, you might find a product that can get you some income during a short period. However, it will never last. By building your brand rather on a specific product than the brand itself, your brand is dead the second the product is. Thus why it is vital to focus on the brand. Build brand loyalty, make people remember the logo, have a clear vision and mission statement etc. This is by no means an easy task, it is way easier to just market a product and sell it. I would recommend everyone to at least try to market your brand as much as your latest product, at least in the first year. Some other cheap but efficient methods is to build up a large email list and consistently send out new information about the niche etc, ask your supplier to include a card with your logo and a message in every package sent etc etc. There are no methods that work for all different type of products, but there is at least one method for everyone. Focus on brand loyalty!

3. **Clicks over sales**

Marketing is tough. Perhaps one of the toughest parts of starting your business, no matter how good your product is. A mistake that I've encountered so incredibly many times is to focus on clicks over sales. This is exactly what most of these new marketing agencies does. They will provide you with a campaign that generates loads of people to your site, but it isn't the right people. I think we can all agree that five paying customers is better than thirty people just visiting your site. So, how do you achieve this? Make sure that your advertisements target the right people! Instead of choosing a broad range of potential customers, do your research. There is so much data out there to analyse which people are the most prone to buying your product. Don't underestimate this, take a good time to just analyse and narrow down your target group. Then make sure that your advertisements are targeting them. Also, make sure that you use the right platform. Once again, in order to do this, analyse, analyse, analyse.

That was all for now. Please comment below whether you agree with these points or if you think other factors are more decisive to why start-ups fail. If you have any questions what so ever, just comment or send me a message.

dropship,What's Wrong With Courses?,"I don't always post on here but wanted your take on this.

So what's wrong with courses? The biggest complaint I hear about them is that knowledge is free online on Google and YouTube and stuff... Yeah it is. But let's be real, can anyone really argue that knowledge is why people buy courses and not buy them for guidance? Here's an example of what I mean. Someone might have knowledge of how dropshipping works and is confident they understand more than average... But they still can't make enough sales to even be profitable. They have all this knowledge they acquired for free but don't know how to implement it in a way that brings back a return. In that case, it's guidance from someone with experience that they need. Not more information.

Another example. You may know Facebook Ads well. You may have all the knowledge in the world about FB ads. But why aren't most people making sales? What gives? What do the big players know that beginners don't? I think it comes down to experience, learning what works and what doesn't and WHY that is. It comes down to learning from your mistakes and failing forward... But that's no longer simply knowledge, is it? That's experience. And experience can't be faked, stolen, or copied. See what I'm getting at? A course can give you the guidance you need to get from $0-$50/day to $5,000 and more. Again, not the information itself. But the guidance on how to use that same information you found for free, to actually succeed. That can only be learned as guidance by people ahead of you, or as experience by trial and error yourself. But if you value $497 more than your time wasted for 12 months, I don't know what to tell you. Time and energy are extremely valuable to high income earners and if that's what someone wants to be, then they need to start acting like one. You could pay $497 to cut your experience curve and start making more money in say, 3 months, or you can lose that opportunity and make zero money for 12 months. You could have been ballin for those extra 9 months making $5k/m or whatever, but your cynicism caused you to lose out.

Obviously you have to make sure the person is reputable. Make sure they don't just know knowledge, but also have practical experience. But since experience can't be faked, it should be easy to tell who's legit and who's not. I can tell pretty quickly. You can buy a course and essentially cheat. Get guidance from someone with experience and cut your time to success in half by learning what NOT to do, which is actually more valuable than learning what TO do.

shopify,feeling defeated,"So I started [dittozebra](https://www.dittozebra.com)  in February after finding myself out of work. I have been making money for other companies with my art in the apparel industry for years. This was the 2nd time I found myself out of work during my career. I wanted more control in my life. I wanted to make money for myself instead of someone else with all my work. I then found a ""temp"" job in March that had an hour commute 1 way. I took it as any work was better than none, and would help while I try to get dittozebra off the ground. I launched the site roughly the same time I started this job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figured when I started I would target all those people who bought my art while working at other companies. I thought I already knew my audience (and maybe I do). Turns out most of those people were not real (at least their social media presence was not). I then started running facebook ads that would target people like my audience. I got lots and lots of clicks on my ads (1000's of visitors), but I got no sales. I then installed hotjar, turns out all those visitors were likely fake. At the same time it became apparent that I was getting fake sign ups to my newsletter. I fixed the newsletter to have double opt in, and thats fixed. I tried a different approach to the facebook ads, aiming for engagement. I had to pull that ad after 24 hours, as it caused a whole bunch of instagram bots to follow my instagram, and although I pulled the ad I'm still getting bots that are following the other bots following me. I'm worried that it ruined my instagram page. I have about 550 real followers, but the 150 I'm not so sure about now. I do create really nice ads that bots seem to love (here is an example of one: [instagram/fb ad](https://www.instagram.com/p/B06VaToA_U3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) \-note I would never run this ad as I make no money on the k9kismet collection, but my other ads are similar. Then my ads drop on a blog post like this [Aurora blog](https://www.dittozebra.com/blogs/news/aurora-borealis). Once I got hotjar it was easy to see all the fake click throughs on my ads. 1000's would visit after clicking the watch more button, but then not play the video that they clicked through to see, it just made no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I have given myself 2 years to make this work. I'm just 6 months in and feeling very defeated. I am going to try google ads next, still reading up on practices on that. I'm also sure that this post will create tons of PM's from supposedly real people who have had great luck with x marketing company or x influencer company. Annoying, but hopefully someone who has been where I am now will read this, and will have something encouraging or that I haven't thought of to head me in the right direction. I really want dittozebra to work, but it's super hard in that I have been creating collections of goods, working on the store, working on ads, working on soical media, all while working 40-50 hours a week and commuting another 10-15. Also that temp job has become more permanent but without any benefits of permanent work, with decent pay.",32,15,2019-08-12,ECOM,0.08246403932571411,0.893947422504425,0.023588532581925392

**08/10/19** \- Research about the niche I want to focus on. I decided to go with the pet niche (*I know, it's overly saturated*)

**08/11/19** \- Purchased a new domain from GoDaddy. (*I will post the domain once the site is complete*)

**08/12/19** \- Shopify account created (*WOOPIE!*)

**08/12/19** \- Managed to create a store logo for my brand, designed the website the way I want it to be and import 5 products from AliExpress. Im hoping that I'll be able to finish the store before the Shopify free trial runs out. Im about to create FB and IG profiles but bed is life. I have to wake up for work in 6 hours

**08/12/19** \- So yeah, I'm here at work yet I managed to browse couple of products at AliExpress. I'll import this once I get home today

**08/13/19** \- I just came home from work. I successfully imported 13 items from AliExpress, customized the main image of every products for branding, fixed every product price margin, fixed alt tags, created product description for each, keyword mapping, internal linking and such. (*Damn boy its tiring | total hours spent today - 5*)

**08/14/19** Nothing done today. Too tired to work on the product imports from AliExpress. Busy day at my day job.

**08/15/19** Total product imported from AliExpress to my site 25, not yet half way with what I need to accomplish.

**08/16/19** I successfully imported half of the products that passed my criteria. I still have 9 days till the Shopify trial ends. I created an Instagram account as that's were I want to focus my organic growth and paid ads investment. I have 10, 750 word, keyword density specific dog niche article outsourced. It should be completed in 1 week. The plan is to post 2 articles per week once the site goes live (To build authority with just a single keyword is my goal), internal linking those to the main products that I want to focus on and implement schema mark up.

shopify,What do good Shopify stores have in common? Shopify Store Review,"What makes a good Shopify store?

I've been doing a bunch of Shopify store reviews lately and as I‚Äôm going reviews of Shopify stores, I want to highlight the really good ones, and what they have in common.

1. Amazing photography. This feels like a no brainer, but there are still lots of drop shipping sites out there using crappy watermarked photos.Even brands using an iPhone. If you can‚Äôt afford a professional photoshoot then get good lighting and edited photos. These are what sell your products!On top of this, have a mix of pure product photos (white background like Amazon), informative (for example all the colours or sizings) and lifestyle shots as well. Show all the different ways your products can be used.
2. Make it easy to do things! This might seem obvious but a lot of sites overdo it with the ‚Äútrust‚Äù. Just because everything can boost conversions doesn‚Äôt mean they all will. Stop popping up an email collection when a customer is trying to purchase, and don‚Äôt get fancy with your CTA. Stick to Add to Cart and Cart/Bag.Same goes for your email collection. Don‚Äôt ask for 39 different pieces of information.
3. Tell your brand story! Look at your analytics - what % of traffic hits your about us page? Really use this to humanize your brand and tell your story. As products are easier than ever to rip off and duplicate. People are buying your story as much as your products.
4. Go premium/custom. None of the good sites look like they‚Äôre using the debut theme. At a minimum customize the colours and fonts a bit, and PLEASE PLEAES PLEASE pay for the premium to remove the watermark.
5. Trust is added tastefully! Maybe it‚Äôs a brand guarantee - maybe subtle secure checkout logos but it‚Äôs not plastered all over the place.

ecommerce,Ecommerce Career Questions,"Hi all!

In a nutshell I'm looking for some advice regarding career opportunities in ecommerce. I have a digital marketing background and have also run an Amazon FBA business plus Woocommerce site for two brands, about 15 years experience in total. I've been for a few job interviews recently and I have noticed Magento seems to be the go-to platform for enterprise level sites and Shopify for small to medium.

I was considering up-skilling myself with Magento but I'm interested to know if that's the best route i.e. are there other more sort after platforms? Will most merchants move away from self hosted ecommerce sites in the future? 

The last company I applied to were a large international brand and by the sounds of it were experiencing declining sales. At a guess I would say it's probably because they have been relying solely on sales through their own site and Amazon has been slowly but surely gaining market share in their vertical. So essentially forcing brands to sell on Amazon.

It seems like it would be a massive leap to try to gain experience/qualifications in Magento development as I only have very limited PHP and HTML knowledge and no JS. However, perhaps some type of analyst role or support position may be more realistic and achievable. Although, even in those types of roles I do not tick many of the boxes when looking at requirements on job sites. 

I'd also be interested to know if the Magento certifications hold much weight and enough to get a foot in the door or would I require experience working with the platform? And if so, how exactly do you go about gaining experience working with a fully functional enterprise level ecommerce platform?

Lastly, any general advice/info at all would be welcome for someone with my experience trying to transition into a new role within ecommerce. I don't have any degrees or major qualifications, everything I know has been gained through experience.  

Thanks in advance to those who provide some input, it's much appreciated!",20,10,2019-08-13,ECOM,0.049180492758750916,0.8937323689460754,0.05708712711930275

ecommerce,I need some cheaper options for international shipping ... help,"So I feel like I'm tying my customers hands here.

I sell small fabric pieces like handkerchiefs, pocket squares, bandanas, etc. I can fold them flat into poly mailers, they come in at 2oz in shipping weight. So the package size is 6"" x 9"" x .25"" thick.

I offer free USPS shipping to my U.S. customers since first class is so cheap. But for my international buyers, the cheapest USPS I can use is $10 to Canada and $13 everywhere else via USPS First-Class Package International. (They don't allow anything other than folded paper and postcards to go via regular first class international which is super cheap. And forget about USPS Priority international since that goes into the $30+ territory.) But apparently some international buyers are still willing to pay the high shipping fee since a third of my sales come from them. But I'm also losing a lot during the checkout process no doubt because they're surprised to see the shipping charges on, say, a $20 order ($20 + $13 in shipping = ridiculous).

The post title is not exactly accurate either.

They both want to carry my products but if it were that simple, such as them being wholesalers, they could just add my products to their sites.  But since we are partnering up and doing profit sharing I can't figure out both a technical and an ethical way to divide the business among our sites but also bring us all together in a way we can self manage the finances.

That is probably sounding confusing.  I'll try to lay it out..  so right now I have my site, I make my sales, I get my profit, simple.

But if I bring in two partners with sites and myself or one of them makes a sale, only that person knows about it, now even though I know and trust my partners, I would like there to be some way that say every time period our Shopify sites can connect and say ""ok, each of you sold X amount of products a, b and c making a profit of $x"" and then we would divide that up by how we have decided.

ecommerce,Alternative to Paypal for a digital download store,"Hi,

I'm owner of an ecommerce where I sell a program developed by me. I'm really fucking annoyed and stressed by Paypal always defending scammers. Just today Paypal refunded a guy who opened a dispute saying he was expecting a game at his home, but I didn't shipped anything. The dispute was opened after two hours he bought my program and on paypal order it was clearly written the name of my tool and digital download, it was also written the key and download link.  I sent every documentation, database log with IP and hour when the asshole activated the key, but nothing. I was a liar for paypal. The amount? 7‚Ç¨. People scams for 7 fucking euro.

I'm a little developer and payment gateways agency reject always my propose because I'm selling digital download things. I asked to BrainTree and stripe but nothing. 2Checkout asked too much documentations that I can't provide because in Italy it is not required to have a VAT ID I don't reach a threshold.

ecommerce,Answer like I'm five because that's how I feel when it comes to ecommerce,"I apologize if I'm making obvious terminology mistakes. I have zero experience with ecommerce or coding for that matter. 

So, we have a family business that is about selling items manufactured in our home country. Most of sales are either to retailers or clients that live oin our or neighboring cities. Recently, we decided to also have an online store. Knowing nothing about it, we hired a guy who made an online store on his own platform. Basically, it wasn't Shopify or woocommerce, but a platform he wrote himself. It seemed fine and all until there were issues. 

Firstly, everything was created from scratch. For example, we had to provide him with all the taxes in different Canadian provinces so that it adds in the invoice, we set the shipping rates without connecting any shipping services, I mean I don't know if I'm explaining it properly but everything is manual. We have him info of what has to be on each page and he coded it. 

So I feel like we did a big mistake by not asking him to do it on woocommerce or something. I feel like there must be plugins for everything to be done automatically - cart, profile, invoice generation. Also, the inventory is super uncomfortable right now, because I need to go into every product separately and manually change the number of items left. 

So what I am looking for is an automated process of everything. I mean, I want our website to be just like all the websites like it - so that it can locate if the person is logged from Canada, US or other country, change currency for that country, automatically generated shipping cost depending on the delivery method and total amount, I want there to be a message that ""add $15 and shipping is free"" and I want everything to be automatic. 

Also I don't know how inventory management works but it would be great if there was an online spreadsheet with all the products so that I could easily change the amount of product I have left, easily add photos etc. Right now, I have to go into each product separately from the admin page and it takes way too long. I have to go to each order separately and change the delivery status and update the tracking #. Maybe that's how it is supposed to be? I have no idea.

 But since he did all this, sometimes there are problems I cannot ignore. We had once or twice a situation where a person ordered something, money went through but we couldn't see the order,so we had to contact this person and ask what exactly they ordered. It's very very bad so I think I cannot have his platform anymore because I cannot rely on it. 

What should I do? Should I make the website from scratch? What platform should I use? Am I using the term ""platform"" correctly? And please forgive me if everything I asked can be just googled, because when I google, there is so many information that I don't know what the fuck am I doing at all. 

Basically what I need is an internet store that has all the built in functions of an internet store - cart, shipping with different carriers, generation of invoices, payment, easy inventory management and so on. All I want to care is design. I don't want to think what info should there be on each page because I think I'm just reinventing the wheel.",11,6,2019-08-18,ECOM,0.051470112055540085,0.9222791194915771,0.026250844821333885

This one is a more psychological question:
What makes people fall in love with big brands and make the people feel proud to wear them?

shopify,Shopify Success Story - The million dollar plant store [Issue #1],"Hi Reddit, this is my first post in /shopify.

I've work in marketing and love reading about online success stories. So...I thought I would have a go at writing about a Shopify success story.

I had never heard about this company before researching them but enjoyed picking apart their marketing channels and finding some learnings.

I hope sharing this might give someone out there an idea or two!

**Issue #1: Money does grow on trees**

[The Sill](https://www.thesill.com/) is an overnight Shopify success, 7 years in the making. Sometimes you just have to wait for the market to catch up.

**Short Bio**

Who: The Sill, indoor plants delivered to your door.

What: Millennials are loving plants.

Why: The rise in urban living means 20-30 somethings want to make the most of small spaces. For many, a window sill is the closest thing to a garden. Oh and plants are very instagramable.

Founded: 2012

Raised: $7.5m

Revenue: $10m+ per year (estimated)

Bestseller: A 7$ plant with heart shaped leaves

**Insta game strong**

500k strong. The Sill has grown their insta account by 174% in 2019. No surprise. Their feed is a gorgeous dose of foliage.

They use a smart strategy of regularly reposting influencer content. This is great for a number of reasons. Reposting can be the first step in building a relationship with key influencers. Most are happy for you to repost their content as long as they are tagged. Curating influencer content also cuts down the amount of original content you need to create. This can be especially useful if you're just starting out.

Learning: Post consistently and repost influencer content to curate the best feed in your category.

**The key to success**

PR and organic traffic are working. The Sill ranks #1 for 'plants'. But even more impressive is that on-site SEO doesn't seem to be a huge priority. Great rankings with little SEO thought? what's going on...

1. Quality backlinks: The Sill is a journalists dream. It's a fantastic business &amp; lifestyle story which resonates in the age of instagram and eco-friendliness. The female founders have managed to bring coolness and convenience to the horticulture industry. With this comes a ton of press from publications big and small. Their backlink profile is impressive but lets not forget this story is 7 years in the making.
2. Low competition: The Sill sits between home depot and your local garden center in a new and expanding market. Neither home depot or your local garden centre can truly own keywords such as 'plants' and 'plant delivery' like The Sill can. It's no surprise Google are currently favouring this Shopify store.

Learning: Traditional PR works but make sure you have a story to share.

**Time to get SEOrious**

Now is the time to double down on SEO. With a strong backlink profile there is an incredible amount of opportunity. I could write much more on their SEO potential but here are two recommendations.

1. Content, Content, Content: The website is relatively thin with less than 50 blog posts. More content is needed around topics such as ""the best plants for shade"". This one term gets over 3000 searches per month and is exactly the kind of keyword The Sill should be creating informative content around.
2. Know your most profitable keywords: Use Google search ads to quickly learn what searches make you money. Terms like 'plant delivery nyc' are competitive keywords which are likely to bring in sales. With local city stores in NYC, LA and SF The Sill should create dedicated pages for these stores and tailor them to searches related to local searches like 'plant delivery nyc'.

Learning: Create content around what your customers search for. Use Google ads to find the most profitable keywords quicker.

**Who needs paid marketing anyway**

With double digit growth in organic traffic, the PR approach is working. However for a venture backed firm, this is unlikely to be enough.

Using Facebook's Ad library (a great free tool for seeing competitor ads), I can't see any evidence that The Sill has FB or Instagram ads running. Setting up dynamic product ads which retarget visitors and cart abandoners is a quick win which I would implement today. Instagram story ads are also working well for many ecommerce businesses. I imagine they would work well for The Sill who already have a highly engaged instagram audience.

Learnings: Retargeting ads are a must as they can convert visitors into customers at a relativity low cost.

**Shopify apps in use**

Lastly a quick shoutout to some of the Shopify apps currently in use on The Sill website.

Back In Stock - Notifies shoppers when products are back in stock.

Conjured Referrals - Refer a friend software.

Pixlee - Adds an instagram feed to your shopify store.

**TLDR**

An online plant store which has been around for 7 years and is currently riding a surge in demand for instagrammable house plants. By mixing original content and influencer reposts they have curated a huge audience of 500k followers. With a great story, PR has been the backbone of their marketing efforts. However, little attention has been paid to on-site SEO. By creating more content they can quickly improve SEO visibility. With no evidence of Facebook marketing they are surely missing a trick when it comes to re-marketing ads.",9,15,2019-08-19,ECOM,0.024552391842007637,0.9282469749450684,0.047200631350278854

shopify,No matter what you sell - make sure you know why...,"Ive been browsing this sub for a while, contributing where I can.

Shopify has made it really easy to setup a store and start selling really quickly, which is great. But one of the issues I see a lot is people not getting sales; which can almost always be identified as to a lack of explanation as to why their potential customers should buy your product.  


I have been involved in the setup, management and promotion of a number of 7 figure businesses across a number of industries - not blowing smoke, just highlighting that this post is my own experience opinion.  


Your homepage should be bountiful. With information about why your product exists. Unless your selling something nobody else has, expect to have competition. You have to show your customers why they should buy your version of your product.  


Those of you who like reading or audiobooks will possibly see this is a similar approach to Simon Sinek and his books, Start with Why and Find your Why.

I simply ran a very basic ad with some success 10-12 orders a day. My issue was that my FB algorithm seemed to only get customers in Canada and this was an issue, since shipping costs were higher and I also had to pay for sales tax. Thus, my margins were very low. I am currently working on another website, but I do feel like there is still lots of potential with yozogems. Do you guys recommend slightly increasing the product prices and running a CBO Campaign ? Any feedback/recommendations will be greatly appreciated ?

ecommerce,Final-Mile Shipping Company Wants Customer Email Address - PCI Compliance Issue?,"My company ships very large, very heavy products to the homes of everyday consumers (think big home rennovation materials). Currently, we provide the customer's name, shipping address, and phone number to the factory. The factory then provides that information to a freight company who will then provides it to a final-mile delivery company.

The final-mile delivery company wants us to provide the customer's **email address** so they can improve the delivery time frame. Customers are significantly more likely to respond to an email than they are to a phone call. Text messaging isn't, apparently, effective enough either, because there are still land lines in play.

My concern is that providing this email address to other businesses in our manufacturing and delivery pipeline will have PCI compliance consequences.

It would be simple if I could just add a disclaimer into our Terms and Conditions that explains that we will give the customer's email address to other entities for the purposes of shipping and delivery, but that information won't be used for marketing purposes, but I'm afraid that there are implications I'm not considering.

shopify,Adding labels to inventory in Warehouse.,"I work at a fairly small company and I need some knowledge from you guys.

Currently we are doing a yearly inventory count. Since I joined the company I've experienced missing way to many products, simply because they weren't successfully/correctly counted.

To counter this I would like to implement barcodes, just for the inventory we have in our one warehouse. This will enable us to do counts on products from time to time, whenever possible. It will definitely be faster to scan a barcode, than finding the product in Shopify and editing the amount.

I'm considering using barcodes with the Code 39 standard. 

Can we just begin from the top and say the first product has barcode with the value of ""1"" and the second product has a barcode with the value of ""2"" and so on?

Or is there a best practice that should be followed?

Please let me know if you have implemented a barcode system.",4,10,2019-08-24,ECOM,0.032937776297330856,0.9283363819122314,0.0387258306145668

shopify,Debut Theme Currency - Multi-Currency Payments,"Ok so as most if not all of us know the debut theme has an inbuilt currency selector to go hand in hand with Shopify's ability to accept any currency anywhere now. Sounds great yes? No........not exactly.

2) Ok the first point is not a major issue because users can manually switch currency right? Yes they can....however.

dropship,"What I learned from courses, and what I did to get the $10k I've once dreamed of","I‚Äôve been struggling with dropshipping for quite a while now (around 8 months to be exact), and I‚Äôve tried a lot of things. I got a bunch of courses, launched three stores so far, but none of them made more than 10 sales. I even bought a TV ad for a small television in my country, to try to go the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù way, especially when TV was getting roasted by entrepreneurs like GaryVee.I just had to see what‚Äôs up and feel the difference. 
It was a mixture between bad niches, and my inability to launch successful ad. That‚Äôs until I got hit with ads by this digital agency. I decided to give dropshipping one last chance. 

Between choosing to go with their partnered suppliers/dropshippers, or POD, I said let‚Äôs move with POD. It‚Äôs sounded better to me as I like buying custom tees myself online.

Here‚Äôs what we did:

1.	Designed a killer store. We made something that stands out of the crowd. No faulty descriptions, and no free themes. Something relatable to the niche. I know this is almost a clich√© at this point, but I hate it when people slap random products in the Brooklyn theme without any order or goal for the customer's behavior.

2.	Went hard on social media. One good thing I learned from the courses and all mentors, is, fake it till you make it. So that‚Äôs what we did. We bought around 5k fake followers, and using mock ups, they created mockups of all clothes, with the print on it, on actual people wearing the clothes. 

3.	**A LOT OF ADS**. I completely handed the marketing part to them, and I stuck with social media and trying to get more organic followers. They created a bunch of Facebook Ads, with around 7-10 ad sets each, and testing different audiences. By monitoring the performance, they managed to find the winning ad sets, and the perfect audience. 
Also the FB pixel got way more matured since clicks were happening all the way throughout the marketing phase, so the data really built up.

4.	Followers started coming in. Shortly after, we started running the ads, and with the already purchased 5k followers, other people were not hesitating to click the follow button. A note here is that I still did lots of digging myself to find people who might be interested in my POD shop, and follow them, for a possible follow back and maybe a purchase. 

5.	**MORE ADS**. Retargeted the shit out of visitors. Despite the skepticism to constantly remind (read ‚Äúspam‚Äù) your potential customers about your brand, we created a bunch of retargeting ads, using different products, in order to grab the attention of our previous visitors. If they saw a t-shirt retargeting ad on Facebook, they‚Äôre now seeing a hoodie in their Instagram feed. And they‚Äôre very inexpensive ads.

Utilizing their marketing tactics, combined with my previous knowledge and effort into the social media channels, we made roughly around $9.7K in revenue, which translates to about $3000 - $3500 profit. 
It opened more opportunities for me to expand from here with the knowledge I gained, and the confidence I got from working alongside the whole agency I worked with. 
I started with fidget spinners, and this is where I ended up. And to be frank with you, I upvote all ‚Äúdropshipping is dead‚Äù articles, because it eases off of the competition. It‚Äôs time the hype leaves the market, and the long term entrepreneurs stay in the game. At least those are my two cents on dropshipping in 2019. 

I highly suggest you avoid asking me what agency I used, and roll up your sleeves to do this on your own, as that is my end goal with this post. Happy dropshipping and hope you stay profitable out there!

Peace

dropship,Gabriel St Germain's Ecom Blueprint 1.0 vs Ecom Blueprint 2.0 (Review/Opinion),"**Yo** everyone, if you haven't purchased Ecom Blueprint 1.0 and plan on buying the bundle included in Ecom 2.0, here's my opinion on it. Some of you may know me from my last post comparing King Comms to Gabriel's, I still stand with King Comm's course for beginners and Gabriel's Ecom Blueprint 2.0 for intermediate/advanced. I did a group buy for Ecom Blueprint 2.0, as previous course owners get a discount towards 2.0. Anyways, if you still can't afford to buy any of the two courses I just mentioned and want to save money for adspend, **message me** your situation and I'll be able to hook it up for *low*.

&amp;#x200B;

(*$297*) EB 1.0: The most detailed of the two, much longer course. As 2.0 is only an update/addition to the original. 

\- The first course, entire runthrough. Intermediate level

\- If you own this course already, you get a discount towards EB 2.0

\- One product store

\- goes over ad creation and facebook ads/ig ads

\- For more thorough review on the EB 1.0, refer to my old post about it

&amp;#x200B;

(*$397*) EB 2.0: New, better store in my opinion

\- The price is $397 because it includes EB 1.0

\- only about 4 hours of content compared to 20+ hours of content on EB 1.0

\- One product store, same category as the previous

\- Better store layout

\- Better help with ad creation, links sources to help with video creation

\- Better upsell plugins revealed

\- Thorough Facebook Ads overview, still as quick as EB 1.0 but that's just how Gabriel talks

\- This Facebook Ads blueprint is better than the previous but also because it's new and updated.

\- If you watched 1.0, this would make much more sense and give you a better understanding of how Gabriel works.

ecommerce,How do you grow SEO wise in a small niche,"Hi guys,

We have been in business for almost 3 years now. We basically dominate search engine results in our space in our country.

We are in the canvas print business (we license arts from different artists) and we hold the first position for almost all related and worthy keywords on google and other search engines.

We feel like we hit the roof for SEO traffic. There is just not a lot of people searching for canvas prints in our country (the keywords ""Art Prints"" and ""Canvas Prints"" for example get searched less than 2000 times a month in the whole country). With the population exceeding 35 Millions, we know the market should be much bigger than this.

Expanding to other countries might not be a viable solution because one of our main competitive edges is free shipping. We make large prints and those cost 100+ USD to ship. This is probably why many local customers choose us VS the big names like [icanvas.com](https://icanvas.com) or [fineartamerica.com](https://fineartamerica.com)

We have a good SEO team and the competition is low. When we want a keyword, we usually get it in a week or so.

Question is, online ads aside, how do we get more traffic from SEO when search volume for all related keywords probably don't exceed 5000 search / month ?

I'm not sure what's going on. It's definitely a nuisance as I manually cancel the automatic abandoned cart recovery email - trying to give them as little data about me as possible.

Each time, they are using the name ""Some Customer"" with the email ""some.cust \[at\] test \[dot\] com"". A ""555-555-xxxx"" phone number, the works. Same information provided each time. The spam is so annoying. The first time or two I thought it might be a real person trying to estimate shipping costs, but I'm not sure why a real person would do this a full four times.

shopify,BREAKING: No More Cheap Shipping for Chinese Sellers,"&gt;**@Charlie1983:**  
&gt;  
&gt;We have contracted negotiated international rates for epacket. We‚Äôre based in Las Vegas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Got notification today that all USPS international GEPS contracts will be terminated September 31st.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is all related to the Universal Postal Union agreement that allows Chinese sellers to ship products to the U.S. for less than it costs us to ship to the same state.  
&gt;  
&gt;The administration has given the UPU an ultimatum, that they: either allow the USPS to set rates for China mail that arrives in the U.S., or the U.S. will officially leave the UPU on October 17th.  
&gt;  
&gt;Either way, this means as of October 17, no more cheap Chinese shipping. They will have to pay the same domestic rates as us once their e-packets arrive here.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is great news for U.S. sellers, especially eBay sellers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bad news for Wish com, Chinese e-commerce sellers, Ali-express, etc.

I am looking to purchase and import products through Alibaba, but the whole importing process has left me with a few questions that I would like to have answered before I proceed and find the answers out the hard way. I have done a bunch of google searching and watched some youtube videos, etc. but I still have some questions.

I have found a manufacturer I want to work with, have worked back and forth to change some design aspects and done all of my math in product costs, shipping, logistics, warehousing, taxes and more. However, the one thing I am unsure of is the importing costs and processes, which leaves me with the following questions:

1. What should I expect to pay in import fees, tariffs, etc when importing very small products from China? Looking to order about 2,000 items weighing a grand total of 95 pounds and taking up about 18 cubic feet.
2. I prefer to ship by air, at least in the beginning when I am keeping a smaller inventory. If I choose FedEx, UPS or DHL will they handle the importing process? If not, what exactly should my process be as far as arranging for the item to be in the right place at the right time for pickup, how do I handle the importing paperwork and payments, etc.?

dropship,Facebook ads discussion,"Hey all, Could someone answer a few of my questions regarding Facebook targeting and drop shipping. And hopefully these answers will prove useful to others!

1: Is the best way to test products is to use around 10-20 ad sets with different targeting similar to the product you're selling? personally I've had no luck with doing this.

2: If you are able to spend 5 dollars or 50 dollars per ad set which should you do? Is it better to use a high budget to get info as fast as possible or does Facebook take time to find that info for you no matter the budget and doing 5 dollars is a better choice?

3: How come when i define my targeting (choose age/gender/location/etc)  based on what got lowest cost per click/lowest CPM the opposite effect happens where CPM and CPC skyrockets instead.

4: Should I stick with getting more data with one product or end my campaign altogether if after 2 days the ad sets aren't profitable.

5: How do you test the same product until eventually it works if you want to commit to that product for example? This question is for one product stores.

shopify,"[New app] As a thank you to this subreddit, Shoppy SMS is free on the App Store.","Hey everyone - 

In January 2019, I launched Shoppy--an app that sends order notifications and daily/weekly/monthly reports from Shopify into your Slack channel--on this subreddit, and it was because of you all that the app now is used by over 120 stores, is profitable, and is growing steadily each week (if you want to see the journey of Shoppy, look through my post history on this sub).

But, one piece of feedback I got was that not every store owner uses Slack, but they would still find these alerts valuable. So, I adapted the code, and yesterday, Shopify published Shoppy SMS to the public so you can now get order notifications and daily/weekly/monthly order reports sent as a text to your phone. 

The app is priced at $5/mo, but as a thank you to all the support from this subreddit, I've turned off subscriptions for a week. So, if you install the app between now and next week, you can use Shoppy SMS for free! Yes, that means there will be no monthly subscription fee, but if you uninstall the app at a later date, I can't promise that the app will still be free.

So, if you want to join the free group and lock in that rate, here is a link to the app page: https://apps.shopify.com/shoppy-sms-order-notifications-revenue-summaries-via-sms (note: the product page will say it's $5/mo, but if you install the app, you'll see a message saying you'll get the app for free)

Also, if you do install the app, I have two requests.

1. Right now, the app supports AT&amp;T, MetroPCS, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, Virgin Mobile, and Google Fi. If you don't see your phone carrier in the list, let me know and I can try andd add it.

2. If you find the app valuable, please post a review! It will really help me out.

Thank you again for all your support and I hope Shoppy SMS helps you all save time and money on reporting.

**TL;DR - Just released an app that sends order notifications and reporting summaries to your phone via SMS. If you install now, you won't have to pay a monthly subscription so try it and let me know what you think!**",16,19,2019-08-30,ECOM,0.034285977482795715,0.9344478845596313,0.03126614913344383
