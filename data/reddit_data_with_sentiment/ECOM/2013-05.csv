We have already exhausted the following options: 
- Wordpress (managed to hack it to work as a blog on SQL Server but has a lot of problems when you try with a more advanced plugin like ecommerce)
- Magento (doesn't support SQL Server at all)
- Drupal with kickstart ecommerce (far too complex)
- Prestashop and Opencart (no SQL Server, only MySQL)
