technology,Theora is not advanced enough to be the next Standard Codec. Being license free is the only thing it has going for it.,"Thought I should make my earlier comment its own post. Everyone seems to have a hard-on for Theora because of its opensource license, but I think the technical details need to be taken into account too.


Ok so I spent the day researching the Theora spec at work (I design video encoding/decoding hardware). Theora is a codec from the stone age. It is not designed with hardware implementations in mind. Obviously mobile devices will want hardware implementations if it is to be a universal standard. Also it lacks MANY features that make today's codecs great. Things like 1/4 pel motion vectors (it is only full pel), B pictures, direct mode, motion vector prediction, variable block sizes, context adaptive entropy coding.. etc. Trust me on this, the only thing great about Theora is the fact that it is royalty free.

What would be awesome is if Google decided to release their newly acquired VP8 codec into the public domain. I have looked into VP8, and it is almost as advanced as H.264. On2 claims it perfoms better, but their opinion is hardly objective.

Apple is committed to H.264. They tend to pick what they think is the the best of the best technologies and push to make it mainstream (like AAC audio). Hopefully this might help resolve the unfortunate license issues with  H.264. Remember MP3 has similar license problems, yet it doesn't seem to bother anyone these days.


Another thing worth mentioning is AVS. This is an H.264-like codec that was developed by China specifically to avoid the license issues with H.264. It performs fairly close to H.264, yet is quite a bit more simple (with the exception of motion vector prediction). It probably has its own license issues though, being intellectual property of China.

(Note: When I talk about a codec's performance, I mean quality vs.  bitrate. Issues of complexity, multi-thread-able, hardware implementation etc are different discussions. But feel free to ask)

technology,Spokeless Bicycle,"Hi reddit, I was part of a mechanical design class last semester at Yale and we made a spokeless bike!

http://imgur.com/gSiC8.jpg

There were nine seniors total (all mechanical engineering majors). Our professor was actually a working full time senior mechanical engineer at Sikorsky. 

As you've probably noticed, only the back wheel is spokeless. This was done for several reasons: Manufacturing the rear wheel/rim was very expensive, so we only had one machined to see if it would work. We knew that if we could get it working for the rear wheel, it would definitely work for the front. But in the end, we ran out of time (class was only one semester long). 

Edit: Hey guys thanks so much for all the comments! I just wanted to elaborate on why we went for the spokeless bike. First, it looks cool. Second, we only had a semester so we wanted to pick something that was both feasible and challenging. Also, you can do a lot of things with the space that opens up where the spokes use to be. You can stick an electric motor in there. You can install some sort of gyro balanced storage basket. Finally, the fact that we couldn't find pictures of a real spokeless bicycle online really sealed the deal. 

2nd edit: Also, this is the first prototype! We weren't even thinking about suspension and all that stuff. If you notice, we only have one brake installed. All we wanted to do was prove the concept of a human powered spokeless bike.

If you guys have recommendations, I'd really appreciate it!

gadgets,"Dear Reddit, What's the Best Pocket HD Camcorder?","I have recently been itching to have a nice cheap &lt;200 dollar pocket hd camcorder. I've pretty much read every review out there, and quite frankly, my mind still isn't made up. So what better than to get some extra advice from reddit?

I think I have it pretty much narrowed down between either the **sony bloggie cm5**, **sony pm5k**, or the **kodak zi8**.  I'm not big on the vado or flip due to the fact that you can't have external memory, as well as a few other issues.

Ideally I would like the one that is best at shooting in low light. (for concert footage, etc).. Granted I know none of these camcorders will be superb at that function, but I would like the best possible =)

* The video of the [pm5k](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MHS-PM5-bloggie-Camera-Violet/dp/B0031RGKVC/ref=pd_cp_p_0) doesn't really look that great from everything I've seen, but it could be my imagination. The 360 lens seems intriguing but I don't know how much I would actually use that.

* The [CM5](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MHS-CM5-bloggie-Camera-Violet/dp/B0031RGKV2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=photo&amp;qid=1266736674&amp;sr=1-1) seems to be put together the best, and it's the only one of the ones I mentioned that has optical zoom.  Downside is that it's slightly bigger and I'm not sure how portable it is.

* The [zi8](http://www.amazon.com/Kodak-Zi8-Pocket-Camera-Black/dp/B002HOPUPC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=photo&amp;qid=1266736657&amp;sr=1-1), from everything I've seen, has great reviews.  It's this camera I am currently leaning towards.

I hope I didn't ramble too much, I just wanted your guy's thoughts on the above, or if you had any other suggestions.

technology,"New ways to surf the web, and discover new content","So, I submitted this a few months ago, and didn't get much vote action, so I will rephrase. Basically, despite the fact that there is so much information on the web (web 1.0) and now so many ways to interact with that information (web 2.0, such as reddit and digg), there are still many good websites out there that get hardly any exposure. (see: http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/50_awesome_websites) The internet has come to be dominated by the likes of facebook, amazon, ebay, you tube, and yes, even reddit. Reddit and digg attempt to bring fresh content to daylight, but often is simply reposted stories off famous news sources and blogs. It is still pretty rare that fresh websites can be brought to the surface. So, (unless there is one that already exists) I propose making a new subreddit where people can vote on websites that deliver content in a way that they agree with, kinda meta meta.

Note: I am aware of delicious, stumble upon, and reddit, but none of them get at the vision I am imagining. A reddit sub reddit would be perfect. What say thee, reddit? Dare I say web 3.0?

Edit: Wow.  Thank you all of you so much!  I submitted this story to reddit.com twice and got no votes, and now this has taken off!  I just checked reddit just now, since last posting that I wanted a better name, and already its a reality.  I can't believe how awesome this is.  This is truely the nature of the singularity.  Have an idea, and its instantly implemented, even before I know it.  Thank you so much, and I hope everyone will continue to submit good content to webbit! http://reddit.com/r/webbit",144,229,2010-02-25,TECH,0.02528858184814453,0.9280057549476624,0.04670560732483864
