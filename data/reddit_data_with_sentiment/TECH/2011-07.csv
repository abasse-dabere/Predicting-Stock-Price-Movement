I have had to tell people their data is gone for good for reasons that weren't true.

If there's interest, I'll post the link. 

If there's no interest, I won't even risk it.

technology,"WTF Senator Feinstein ""The bill would not violate Internet users' First Amendment right to free speech because copyright piracy is not speech.""","I have received this email from California senator Dianne Feinstein:

&gt;Dear (Me)

 

&gt;I received your letter expressing your opposition to the ""Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act,"" commonly known as the ""PROTECT IP Act.""  I appreciate knowing your views on this matter. 

 

&gt;America's copyright industry is an important economic engine, and I believe copyright owners should be able to prevent their works from being illegally duplicated and stolen.  The protection of intellectual property is particularly important to California's thriving film, music, and high-technology industries. 

 

&gt;The ""PROTECT IP Act"" (S. 968) would give both copyright and trademark owners and the U.S. Department of Justice the authority to take action against websites that are ""dedicated to infringing activities.""  These are websites that have ""no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or facilitating"" copyright infringement, the sale of goods with a counterfeit trademark, or the evasion of technological measures designed to protect against copying.  The bill would not violate Internet users' First Amendment right to free speech because copyright piracy is not speech.  On May 26, 2011, this legislation was reported favorably out of the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration by the full Senate. 

 

&gt;I understand that you oppose the ""PROTECT IP Act.""  While I supported reporting the bill to the full Senate, please know that, prior to the close of the 111th Congress, I worked with California high-technology businesses and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to improve upon language from previous versions of the bill and to address the concerns of legitimate high-tech businesses, public interest groups, and others.  However, I recognize that the bill needs further work to prevent it from imposing undue burdens on legitimate businesses and activities, and I will be working to make the improvements, either by working in cooperation with Chairman Leahy or by offering amendments on the floor of the Senate.  Please know I will keep your concerns and thoughts in mind should the full Senate consider the ""PROTECT IP Act.""

 

&gt;Once again, thank you for sharing your views.  I hope you will continue to keep me informed on issues of importance to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 224-3841. 


&gt;Sincerely yours,

  &gt;Dianne Feinstein
          United States Senator

technology,Net neutrality is dying as we speak and there is no knight in shining armour coming to help.,"Right now a shift is taking place. Isp's are making data more expensive to consumers when data is costing the isp's less and less. Bandwidth caps will eventually limit competing online services to that of the isp itself as exemplified by this post.

250Gig bandwidth caps may not cause much of a problem to the average netizen right now but as both internet speeds and the quality of our downloads or streaming increases, 250Gig a month will become to you as that huge 60 gig hard drive you got 10 years ago. With the implementation of an isp's media service that does not count against this cap, the isp's are effectually ending net neutrality by prioritizing their services over others. This may not happen over the next year or two, but in five years we will ask ourselves where the good old days of the internet went.

But it's not starting in five years, it has already begun. I have little or no confidence that the government will do anything, as has been the trend when lots of corporate money is concerned. If this state of politics doesn't infuriate you as it does myself, then stop reading and go back to being sheep and don't complain when the corporate state of politics leads you to destitution.

Reddit has made some plans to help such as [/r/darknetplan](http://reddit.com/r/darknetplan) but haven't gained much traction as people tend to forget that they are getting fucked once they see a kitten. We need to raise awareness and act to get something substantial done.

I'm not much of a technical guy when it comes to computers but I know enough to know that this an incredibly important issue and needs Reddit's full support if we are to achieve something. You guys pull through spectacularly when helping others but don't when you need to help yourselves.

As I said, I'm not much of a technical guy so the scope of my ideas are limited. However Reddit has gotten quite large and if we all chipped in, it seems possible to create our own isp. A community owned, non-profit isp where the price you pay is the price that it costs for the service to be maintained and expanded. Sure it would be very localized at first but I'm confident that with low prices and great service, expansion is only inevitable as it gains traction. I'm not under the illusion that this would be anywhere near as simple as it sounds and the big isp's would like nothing better to destroy us. However if it's any site that would be capable to pull it off, it's Reddit


**edit** To make a distinction, the real issue is data equality, not whether ips's should meter internet use. (although metered use would be a direct means by which the isp's can affect data equality, which is not unprecedented as exemplified above)

**edit 2** For those of you engaging in the secondary debate of whether or not isp's are justified in charging for bandwidth, I agree that it is fair for them to do so but with the distinction that these prices should be fair. Currently, they are not fair as the price per gig goes up for the consumer as price per gig goes down for the isp.

**edit 3** When I said ""this post"" in the first paragraph I meant to say [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/iqkuk/the_audacity_of_shaw_how_canadas_internet_just/) 
Hopefully that clears some things up

technology,HOW TO:  Remove yourself from the background check site BeenVerified.com,"Why am I sharing this trick (well, not really a trick, but based on some serious TOU reading)?  Because it's bullshit that corporations buy and sell our personal information.

**First,** [search the site](http://www.beenverified.com/) to make sure you're listed.  They usually have your legal name, aliases, age, current and previous addresses, and family members, but anyone can pay to see more (like your criminal record, bankruptcies, and more).  

**Second,** email Support@BeenVerified.com with the following template:

Dear Been Verified Customer Support:

As per your privacy policy, please remove my listing from your databases:

a. First name:  
b. Last name:  
c. Middle initial:  
d. Aliases &amp; AKA's:  
e. Current address:  
f. Age:  
g. DOB:  

Thank you for your assistance.

**Third,** you'll get one email saying they received your opt-out request, and another confirming you've been deleted.

**Fourth,** spread the word.

EDIT:  Wow, glad you guys appreciate the info!  Would you like to see a big one of these for *all* the big people search sites, like Intelius, Spokeo, MyLife, PeekYou, etc?  I'm MORE than happy to provide.  The more people know about this and remove themselves, the safer all our identities will be.

Also, apparently I have to explain that I don't work for BeenVerified even though I'm providing info that results in a direct loss to them (your listings).  I actually work for [an online privacy startup in Cambridge](http://www.abine.com), but I didn't want to say that or say where I work because I wanted to provide helpful info without being criticized for ""advertising.""

EDIT 2:  Here are some more people search sites you can delete yourself from while you're at it:

* [WhitePages](http://www.whitepages.com):  search for yourself and then scroll down until you see ""Is this you? Remove your listing"" on the bottom left, then follow the instructions.  It's basically just a CAPTCHA.  
* [PeopleFinder](http://www.peoplefinder.com):  search for yourself, bring up your listing, and then click the ""remove listing"" link above the map.  On the removal page, pick a reason for deletion from the drop-down menu (I like ""general privacy concerns"").  Note that you DON'T have to provide your email; just ignore it and fill in the CAPTCHA, then hit the ""remove me"" button.
* [Spokeo](http://www.spokeo.com):  Search for yourself, copy the URL of the page that comes up for you, and go [here](http://www.spokeo.com/privacy).  
* [PeekYou](http://www.peekyou.com):  Search for yourself, locate your profile, then open a new tab and go to their [opt-out page](http://www.peekyou.com/about/contact/optout/).
* [MyLife](http://www.mylife.com):  Call 1-888-704-1900, press option 2, wait to speak to a person, tell them that you want to remove your listing, and say that you found it by Googling yourself if they ask.  They may also ask if you have a paid membership with them or get emails from them; the answer is no in both cases.  They ask for your name, age, current address, and sometimes a previous address before they'll remove you.
* [Intelius](http://www.intelius.com):  Go to their opt-out form [here](https://www.intelius.com/optout.php), but note that you'll need to upload a copy of your driver's license or other ID.  Ridiculous, right?",301,698,2011-07-26,TECH,0.0824379101395607,0.8968318104743958,0.020730268210172653

She also provided a list of the top sites online that hold data on you.

I decided to go ahead and use this list to collect removal procedures from ALL of these websites and provide direct links or instructions to do so.

The following list was provided as being the ""big boys"", so if you remove your name from these ones then all the smaller ""sites"" should fall afterwards.

* ZabaSearch.com

* PeopleSmart.com
* PrivateEye.com
* WhitePages.com
* USA-People-Search.com
* Spokeo.com
* PublicRecordsNow.com
* DOBSearch.com
* Radaris.com

How to remove yourself from each of these have been listed below.  I would recommend that you scan some form of ID such as a state issued ID like a drivers license.  Black out your picture and drivers number.  Leaving your name, address and DOB visible.  Any sites that requires such a thing will have an * after the address.
