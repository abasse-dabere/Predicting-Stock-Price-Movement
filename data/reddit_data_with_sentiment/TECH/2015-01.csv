technology,[PICS] I just finished soldering this yesterday. My watch displays my blood sugar via a tiny computer receiver box and implanted skin sensor.,"PICS: http://imgur.com/a/GVN6c

The sensor is a hair-thin platinum wire coated in many layers of polymers and glucose-oxidizing molocules, which release electrons relative to the concentration of glucose in your flesh. A thumbnail sized transmitter with electrodes collects the electrons, and transmits a guess of the blood sugar concentration. These sensors are $350 for a 4-pack, and last 1-3 weeks generally. The wire is injected into the skin on application, and pulls right out leaving no mark at all usually.

Commercially there is a receiver that filters and calibrates the data and displays a graph, but it has no wireless transmission capabilities. That's where the Wixel comes in. The Wixel is like an Arduino, with a 2.4GHz RF antenna (same frequency as the sensor transmitter). The other parts are a 500 mAh LiPo battery, charging board, and Bluetooth Low Energy module to pair with an Android phone. A custom Android app receives the raw data and calibrates it, by plotting manually inputted blood test strip results vs raw sensor numbers, and best-fitting a relationship line. The app uploads the blood sugar value to a mongodb database, and an Azure server page displays the value. A custom smartwatch face pulls this number from the URL and displays it on the watch.

Having your blood sugar trend available at a glance on an e-ink watch is very beneficial to type 1 diabetics. Normally the pancreas stabilizes blood sugar via a biological control loop, releasing insulin to lower blood sugar, and releasing sugar to increase it. Type 1 diabetes means you blood sugar is uncontrolled and unstable - it simply accelerates up when you eat and accelerates down when you inject insulin. If a type 1 diabetic stops paying attention and correcting their blood sugar, they can easily fall into a coma by the end of the day, with sugar levels below 1/2 or above 400% of normal concentrations being the life-threatening zones. With frequent corrections a type 1 can potentially keep a very stable blood sugar and live a normal lifespan, which is what I hope to do.

The data path is Transmitter &gt; Wixel &gt; Bluetooth module &gt; Phone &gt; Mongo server &gt; Azure server &gt; phone &gt; pebble.

technology,The free flow of information is one of the most amazing parts of the internet. The free flow of information is crucial to democracy. Do not let the government or coronations take that away!,"When dealing with internet related issues, remember why the internet is so powerful. The free flow of information circumvents any censorship and thus prevents the government from hiding different opinions from you. 

People call for more control over the internet to stop the radicalization of youth. They want to control everything we see online just to stop a few already problematic individuals from reading it. This is a slippery slope and I wish more people realized this. I've been called a conspirtard for telling people that it is crucial for a democratic society to maintain the free flow of information that has the ability to expose even the darkest secrets governments and corporations may hide. 


There's a multi billion dollar industry for surveillance technology and private intelligence agencies. These private intelligence agencies work for governments and corporations. They also sell internet filters to known human rights abusers while also selling it Americans. They make money by filtering and will lobby to filter internet everywhere if not stopped. Under the guise of national security, companies in this industry can lobby against the free flow of information and the ability to have privacy online. The MPAA and the RIAA seem to have values and some technology similar to the surveillance industry, so be warned.  


Please think about every piece of legislation that governments try to pass to impose limits to free speech online via controlling the flow of information. Don't let the internet loose it's greatest asset for future generations!

There are so many enemies of the internet that will do anything to control the flow of information, we must never let that happen.

gadgets,Alternative uses for a new Kindle Fire?,"Completely out of the blue I got a Kindle Fire for christmas.

As awesome a gift as it is, it's...kinda like being given a car when you can cycle everywhere in your life or pay a tenner for a train trip once a month, so you never really need a car but now have to pay for insurance on one. Awesome present, but kiiiinda useless in your life.

This Kindle is like that for me. I read lots, but I prefer physical books and I'm a student, so typically too poor to afford paying full price for E-books instead of a penny+shipping for a second hand copy. When I get through my physical backlog I'm sure I'll start downloading freebies.

But until then it's just sort of sat on my shelf. It doesn't seem 'useful' in really any other circumstance than the odd free book. I've never been one for the whole candy-crush type gaming, it's too small really to be using in my studies for note-taking and lectures, and more pointedly, I already have a good laptop, so...it's kind of redundant to stop watching movies, reading news, gaming, skyping, studying, music-listening etc on my laptop just to do so on a much less powerful, smaller device.

I've been looking around at other 'what to do with a kindle!' pages and aside from the daft self-plugging ""use it like an I-pad!"" type 'uses' the few 'its a nightstand/couch/kitchen' tool seem like a brilliant idea....in several years...when I have a living room or multiple floors, right now I'm a student so my entire home consists pretty much of kitchen, computer desk, bed. all within about 15 paces of each other.


So yeah, are there any....idk, 'abnormal' uses I can get out of a Kindle Fire? I don't really even know what kind, something that could supplement computer usage maybe? In the back of my mind I'm trying to think of stuff similar to bitcoin mining. Not literally, but the same kind of 'stuff you can't actually use a normal-use laptop for'


Unfortunately no, donating it to a hospital or charity *really* isn't an option. I do that sort of thing with old tech I don't use, but this is a brand new present from a parent. I'm fairly sure it would *not* go down well if she asked how I was getting on with it and my response was ""eh, gave it to charity.""",14.0,9,2015-01-17,TECH,0.0504554845392704,0.9201473593711853,0.029397156089544296

gadgets,Galaxy Tab S V Sony Xperia Z2 tablet,"I wanted opinions, preferably from those who have actually owned both tablets. I have had the Galaxy tab S for around 6 months now and have recently began to find touchwiz increasingly annoying, mainly because of lag (as well as the touch being unresponsive at times). I could uninstall it through root and run it off stock android but this would void my 2 year warranty. When I was deciding which tablet to buy I was torn between the galaxy tab s and z2 but decided on the galaxy because it was not that much more expensive given the amount of extra features (fingerprint scanner, display quality, screen size etc.) I know the galaxy tab has better specs etc but this is vastly overshadowed and undermined by the lag from touchwiz. 

My main concerns about the z2 are the size and display. Of course samsung hold the title for best displays and coming down from their superamoled display to Sony's triluminous display could be frustrating. Also, despite the z2's superior build quality I feel like the large bezels make the 10 inch screen, which is already smaller than the galaxy tab s, feel even smaller (and oddly wide and rectangular feeling). Also after doing some research online I found that the z2's screen can be unresponsive, especially when typing.

Being someone who's into photography as a hobby (photography: lordcande.vsco.co ) the camera on the N6 was a big factor in whether I paid so much (£400/$628) for the phone. However having gotten to use it, its even worse than the camera on the N5, which I personally didn't even find that bad, (although it could have been better). I always assumed as the camera on the N5 wasnt super high end because the phone was so affordable and sacrifices would have had to be made to keep the price so low. Now that the nexus 6 is somewhat more expensive and premium why is the camera so poor?

The Dell XPS 18 touch is only upto 8GB ram.... all of those tablet type PCs are limited to 8GB for now. Wacom makes a portable PC (The Cintiq Companion) that would be far better for drawing and painting BUT it's still limited to 8GB 

ram and has a much smaller screen (only 13"") The only one that has more (16GB) is the apple Modbook and that sucker costs over $3K, I just can't do it.

I am leaning towards the Dell XPS 18 and a Bambo​o Styl​us feel because of the screen real estate but can't seem to find an artist's review of it. The wacom Cintiq Companion is second on my list because I know for a fact it will kick ass for digital painting, it's just smaller than I want. I'm used to working on my painting with my reference up and a selection of brushes etc.... I need that screen real estate.
