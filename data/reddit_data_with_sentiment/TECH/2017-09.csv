TLDR: Large corporate members of the W3C are being given preferential treatment by the Director of the W3C versus researchers, governments, archivists, and security experts. What should have been a general consensus by compromise on the topic of DRM, has all been overruled by the Director in favor of large corporations. 

Imagine if Flash technology was made a permanent fixture in modern browsers instead of being fazed out, and the security nightmare fallout for future generations. 

The DRM being proposed by large corporations makes it a criminally punishable offense to audit it for security flaws, which is basically  a loss for everyone.

technology,"Congress is holding hearings today on SESTA, a bill that poses a major threat to sites like reddit that host user-generated content","**TLDR; Congress is moving quickly toward a vote on a bill that would enable Internet censorship and fundamentally change sites like reddit with user-generated content. [Contact your lawmakers here.](https://www.stopsesta.org)**

Most folks here probably remember SOPA / PIPA. The bill’s sponsors said it was about stopping online piracy, but everyone knew it was really about censorship.

Now, Congress is at it again. They’re holding a hearing today, and rushing toward a vote on a bill called SESTA, the absurdly named “Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act,” but once again, this bill has nothing to do with stopping sex trafficking. [Instead](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/internet-censorship-bill-would-spell-disaster-speech-and-innovation ) it would decimate online communities like Wikipedia and Reddit, and enable widespread Internet censorship.

**[Everyone who cares about online communities and freedom of expression should take a second right now to contact their lawmakers.](https://www.stopsesta.org)**

SESTA would weaken [CDA Section 230](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230 ), which is one of the basic free speech protections that has allowed the Internet to grow into what it is today.

Section 230 is what makes it possible for web services to allow user-generated content. It protects them from massive liability by ensuring that online services can’t be sued out of existence because someone uses their platform improperly.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. Why should we care whether Internet companies are protected from liability? Here’s why: without this basic rule, social media as we know it would not exist, and neither would online video sharing communities, discussion forums, or even the comments sections on news sites.

Under the current law, websites like these can allow users like us to engage in free expression because they are not liable for the things we post, as long as they comply with the law and take down abusive or illegal content when it’s flagged.

But if SESTA passes, that freedom ends. Startups and small businesses who don’t have money for lawyers and endless legal fees would likely be forced to shut down completely, and big web companies like Facebook and Twitter would likely automatically censor anything they’re even slightly worried might get them sued: whether it’s a politically charged comment, a provocative video, or meme that they deem to be “risky.”

The worst part of all this? SESTA [could actually](http://www.new.swopusa.org/2017/08/11/call-to-actionpress-release-swop-usa-stands-in-direct-opposition-of-disguised-internet-censorship-bill-sesta-s-1963-call-your-state-representatives-and-tell-them-to-fight/ ) make sex trafficking easier, not harder, and put sex workers in more danger.

By gutting the “Good Samaritan” provision within Section 230, it would actually *discourage* web companies from having good moderation and community guidelines, by [exposing](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2017/07/senates-stop-enabling-sex-traffickers-act-of-2017-and-section-230s-imminent-evisceration.htm ) them to massive criminal liability if they make a mistake or miss a post that should have been taken down. 

**SESTA is a very real threat to the future of free expression on the Internet, and it’s moving fast. The bill has bipartisan support and has already picked up two dozen sponsors. Many members of Congress will jump at the chance to attach their names to a bill that they think is about ending sex trafficking. If the Internet doesn’t speak out now and make sure lawmakers and the public understand what this bill would really do, it will almost certainly pass. **

We've defeated dangerous Internet legislation like this before. Please educate yourself about what this bill really does, spread the word, and **[make sure you contact your lawmakers.](https://www.stopsesta.org)**",197,2419,2017-09-19,TECH,0.0861482173204422,0.8876138925552368,0.02623792737722397

technology,"Today myself and 60 other Internet users (many of them redditors!) are traveling to Washington, DC to meet directly with our Senators and Representatives about defending net neutrality","Hi Reddit, so today myself and 60 other Internet users (many of them redditors!) from as far away as Alaska, Kansas, Minnesota, and California are traveling to Washington, DC to meet directly with our Senators and Representatives tomorrow about defending Title II net neutrality protections, which [prevent](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) companies like Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Comcast from charging extra fees to access online content or engaging in discriminatory censorship and throttling. 

It’s part of a [coordinated effort](https://www.battleforthenet.com/dc) to arrange face to face meetings between net neutrality supporters and lawmakers, organized by public interest groups like Fight for the Future (disclosure: i work there!), Public Knowledge, EFF, Center for Media Justice, Writers Guild West, and others. 

These meetings are so important because the companies that are working to kill net neutrality protections are [spending millions](https://maplight.org/story/house-panel-members-considering-net-neutrality-repeal-got-3-times-more-donations-from-isps/) of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions -- they have lobbyists hitting Capitol Hill constantly spreading fear and misinformation. Their goal is to get the FCC (currently lead by former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai) to gut the current rules, and simultaneously push Congress to pass bad legislation that would permanently undermine net neutrality and allow for paid prioritization and other ISP abuses.

**Obviously most redditors can’t drop everything to come to Washington, DC for a day, but there are lots of ways to get involved, and if we don’t come together to defend net neutrality now, we could lose it forever. Here’s some ways you can help!**

1. [Contact your lawmakers and the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com)
2. [Attend a local meeting with your lawmaker](https://events.battleforthenet.com)
3. [Volunteer for ‘Team Internet’](https://www.battleforthenet.com/jointeaminternet/)
4. Call, email, and tweet at your lawmakers and tell them to speak out against the FCC’s plan to gut Title II and oppose any legislation that undermines net neutrality.

The FCC has to answer to Congress, and Congress has to answer to us, their constituents. Let’s use the power of the Internet to save it. We can do this.",38,1413,2017-09-26,TECH,0.06735735386610031,0.9087159633636475,0.023926662281155586
