technology,Dropbox raised their referral limit to 8GB. Let's have a party to celebrate! (again),"Ok, yes.. This was done recently. But, a LOT of people didn't get in on it fast enough, so, they didn't get referrals. Think of this as Dropbox referrals, part 2. It's your second chance to get 8GB of extra Dropbox space.

Please choose a random code from below.

Remember.. Remove your code when you've reached your limit.

Edit: In case you don't know.. If you sign up without a referral code, you only start with 2GB. If you USE a referral code, you start with 2.25GB. So, any way you slice it, you come out ahead. :)

Also.. Dropbox rocks. They use Amazon S3 to securely store your files and synchronize them between as many computers/iPhones/etc as you want.

Edit 2: One last thing.. In order for this to work, we need up-votes. Yeah, it's lame. But.. This is a self.reddit. So, I don't benefit from karma. SO.. upvote, sign up, post YOUR referral link and we can all prosper!

gadgets,iPad: The Disneyland of Computers,"Ed Felten on the iPad and Disneyland:

&gt; Tech commentators have a love/hate relationship with Apple's new iPad. Those who try it tend to like it, but many dislike its locked-down App Store which only allows Apple-approved apps. Some people even see the iPad as the dawn of a new relationship between people and computers.
&gt;
&gt; To me, the iPad is Disneyland.
&gt; 
&gt; I like Disneyland. It's clean, safe, and efficient. There are lots of entertaining things to do. Kids can drive cars; adults can wear goofy hats with impunity. There's a parade every afternoon, and an underground medical center in case you get sick.
&gt;
&gt; All of this is possible because of central planning. Every restaurant and store on Disneyland's Main Street is approved in advance by Disney. Every employee is vetted by Disney. Disneyland wouldn't be Disneyland without central planning.
&gt; 
&gt; I like to visit Disneyland, but I wouldn't want to live there.

technology,"An objection to ""If you don't like it, don't buy it and 
stop bitching"" reasoning","In light of the recent update in the developer's agreement for the iPhone, countless discussions have appeared on the 
internet which follow the same beaten path of such conversations.

Namely, they boil down to somebody saying someting along these lines:

""It's Steve Job's company, and he has every right to do whatever he wants with it. He sets up the rules. If you don't like 
the rules, don't buy his products, don't bitch about it on the forums"".

This point is incorrect for many reasons, one of them being that if you don't like people bitching about anything, you are 
just as free to not read it. However, that's not the reason I am going to talk about. The reason I will talk about is this:

**Doing so does not make sense from an economic point of view. **

The argument makes assumptions that:

* there exists a product that satisfies all of your requirements;
* you are able to invest in such product and use it;
* your pruchase of a competitor's product will make a company reconsider its choices;
* telling other people about what you don't like about X does not make any difference.

All these assumptions are false. First of all, it is rarely the case that there exists a product on the market that has all 
the feature any particular customer wants. For that matter, one can desire a product that, in fact, *is* an iPhone with 
feature X on it.

Secondly, the argument assumes that one can just go and buy a new piece of technology at any time, even if there is a product 
that satisfies the requirements. Not all people have the budget to switch. Some are 
tied by other factors (e.g. people who actually want an iPhone might be deterred by AT&amp;T). Some people purhcased a product 
before a better one appeared on the market. 

Thirdly, simply buying a competitor's product doesn't work if only a minority
of its users are not satisfied. As long as the decrease in the influx of customers
is a smaller loss than the cost of adding a feature (think Fight Club!). 

More importantly, **a person who bought an iPhone, didn't like it and switched is not a loss for Apple**
if the said person is silent about it. This brings us to the fourth point:
that's exactly what Apple would want you to do: they would rather lose customers
than have complaining customers. This is why the phones are locked and the App store is 
insanely restrictive, in spite of potential loss of customers that it brings.

So, as a consumer who is unhappy about X on the iPhone, what are you to do? 

You are to bitch about it, loudly and publicly. You are to scream in all forums about how
X makes your life miserable, and how iPhone is not good without X. You are to say that
you are going to switch to an Android phone next month because X on the iPhone makes it
unusable for everybody. Make a ""Top 5 reasons why you shouldn't own an iPhone"" on your blog
(""Top 10"" if you own one), with X being the No. 1 reason. 

In short, you are to make a person about to buy an iPhone reconsider doing it because of X.

So, you are to make some bad publicity for Apple. Bad publicity is always a loss for a company, and it's
a loss that is noticeable to shareholders. In this day and age, even a blog post can go far.
And if you scare the shareholders, even Steve Jobs will have to abide. And if Apple *still* keeps its course 
in spite of your efforts, you still win by strengthening the competition, who (if smart) might
even make a product for you that is good and has X.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr: if you want a feature X on a platform, bitching about X en masse is an effective way
to hurt the company just enough for it to provide X for you.  So, **Bitching is a good negative reinforcement**.

Cool. The phone belonged to a poor schmuck who got drunk and left it on a stool. Whatever. 

But then Giz decides to post the kid who lost the phone's personal info, Facebook page and Flickr, all alongside a picture of the dude holding a **WHISKEY** bottle. Basically portraying him as an alcoholic dumbass, while simultaneously painting a picture of Giz being totally innocent, along with the dude who ""found"" the phone sitting on the stool. That post [here](http://gizmodo.com/5520438/how-apple-lost-the-next-iphone).  Why do this? Why piss on this guys corpse?

technology,I emailed the writer of the Gizmodo article about the guy that lost the iPhone prototype. Here is his response.,"My Email:
&gt; Dear Mr. Diaz,

&gt; As much as I have enjoyed Gizmodo's scoops about new technology, I am afraid this is the last time I will be visiting the site. I was excited to read about Apple's new iPhone but horrified to see personal details of the engineer that lost it published on the site. I am sure he was horrified to have lost the phone but I cannot imagine what it must feel like to have his photo plastered all over stories about his legendary fuck up. 

&gt; Former Reader,
&gt; billOtheClwn


His Response:
&gt; Hello,

&gt; Thank you for your feedback. Here's the reason why we decided to post the story.

&gt; Powell is now under the public eye, which will protect him against
Apple firing him (We believe he's still employed and Apple didn't fire
him when they found out, a month ago. He's a valuable engineer). It's
embarrassing, yes, but it's like insurance. If Apple fires him, they
will get a huge PR backslash.

&gt; But let's not forget: 1) He lost one of the most valuable gadgets in
the world. And 2) the story—and his name—was going to be reported by other media. We had the facts before anyone else. It was our job to
report on it.

&gt; You should look at the bigger picture..

gadgets,"I was a victim of the Monoprice data breach, and I received this letter in the mail from them a few days ago. It is so awesome that I need to share it with you guys!","I'll preface this by saying I sent this in to Consumerist a little over a week ago. I received a response back from them saying they'd ""look into it"", but it hasn't (yet) been posted. I really feel like I need to tell folks about this because it's *awesome*, so...here you go, reddit. Monoprice really went above-and-beyond what they needed to do for their customers.

____________________________________________________________

I received **[this letter](http://i.imgur.com/LGrNw.png)** in the mail from Monoprice on April 16th, and I suspect more are coming to other customers. Since I was a victim of the credit card data breach that happened back in March (I never reported it to Monoprice, by the way), Monoprice has enrolled all of the customers whose information had been compromised in 12 months of free credit monitoring and ID theft consultation/restoration service from ID TheftSmart. Wow! They really went above-and-beyond. I am truly impressed.

Backstory: I purchased an HDMI cable from them on January 5th (a bit before the date they give in the letter, but I definitely was a victim of the data breach) and my bank noticed that suspicious charges started coming up on my credit card account around March 13th. To Bank of America's credit, they caught the transactions as soon as they went through, froze my account, and called me to see what was going on. I took a peek at my account and lo and behold, three charges (match.com, cupid.com, and a pre-authorization from iTunes) totaling in about $300 went through before BoA put the clamp down on my account. All of the charges were in rapid succession of one another and, as I would find out later, were all processed in a foreign currency. I guess even CC number thieves need love!

BoA straightened it all out within 5 days so I got a new card and all of my money back, but I didn't put two and two together until I went back to Monoprice to buy more HDMI cables (since the first one rocked so much) and noticed that they were not taking credit card orders because of a potential data breach. Then it all made sense. I am extremely careful about who gets my personal information and could not think of how my number was stolen. Being a longtime customer of Monoprice, it had never even crossed my mind that my number could have been stolen from them.

Despite all this happening, Monoprice have proven themselves again and again to be worthy of my continued patronage because of how they handled the data breach once it was discovered. I wish all retailers, banks, and credit card companies would be so candid and generous to their customers in events such as this.",22,30,2010-04-25,TECH,0.111786849796772,0.8566883206367493,0.031524837017059326
