technology,This is a serious question: Why isn't Edward Snowden more or less universally declared a hero?,"He might have (well, probably did) violate a term in his contract with the NSA, but he saw enormous wrongdoing, and whistle-blew on the whole US government.  
At worst, he's in violation of contract requirements, but felony-level stuff? I totally don't get this.  
Snowden exposed tons of stuff that was either marginally unconstitutional or wholly unconstitutional, and the guardians of the constitution pursue him as if he's a criminal.  
Since /eli5 instituted their inane ""no text in the body"" rule, I can't ask there -- I refuse to do so.  

Why isn't Snowden universally acclaimed as a hero?

technology,"Digital privacy advocates should be terrified of a Clinton presidency. On Dec. 19, 2015, Hillary Clinton said she wanted a ""Manhattan-like project"" to break encryption.","During the 19/12/2015 Democratic debate, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was asked about the issue of electronic surveillance and encryption.

&gt; ""You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data,"" Raddatz said. ""So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?""

&gt; Clinton said she ""would not want to go to that point"" of forcing companies like Apple to give encryption keys to law enforcement.

&gt; ""I would hope that, **given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners**,"" Clinton continued. ""**It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.** There must be some way. I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.""

&gt; Clinton added some caveats. ""Maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that,"" she said. The US also has to ""balance liberty and security, privacy and safety."" **But ultimately, Clinton said she wants tech companies to cooperate with the government. ""Otherwise, law enforcement is blind—blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after,**"" she said.
