technology,Choice Hotels just tried to install a Bitcoin miner on my laptop,"I just logged onto the internet at Comfort Inn about ten minutes ago, and immediately Google Chrome blocked a download and Windows Defender logged a Bitcoin miner.

I travel for work and recently have used internet at Marriott and SPG hotels with no security problems. This is the first time I've ever logged in at a Choice Hotels location. This is also the only hotel brand I've used that doesn't require an initial guest login with your room number or anything like that. You just click ""I agree"" and off you go, mining coins apparently.

Simple conclusion: Choice Hotels is trying to install Bitcoin miners on their guests' computer immediately upon login, but Chrome and Defender block it immediatey.

technology,"Why is everything (net neutrality, games, etc.) trending toward a two-lane model, one for the rich, one for the poor?","* The FCC will probably kill net neutrality, which means that rich people will be able to have the same Internet as before, whereas poor people will have a crappier version, with less content and less bandwidth.

* PC gaming is moving toward a microtransactions/pay-to-win/loot crates model, where, again, people with money can pay for the full experience, whereas people without money will have to content themselves with a crappier, more boring version of the game.

I could name other examples. It used to be that everyone with a computer had access to the same Internet (speeds aside), regardless of how much they could pay. Likewise, it used to be that everyone playing a game was playing on an equal footing: same characters, same features, etc. Why are things changing now? Why didn't it before? Can it be stopped? And what does this mean for the future of the Internet/computers/games?",154,283.0,2017-11-15,TECH,0.042861007153987885,0.9291394352912903,0.02799961529672146

technology,"Here is the FCC's 'Guide to the Open Internet'. Questions, comments, and concerns can be directed to ombudsperson@fcc.gov or 202-418-1155. Please upvote for visibility.","**What is an 'Open Internet'?**

Sometimes referred to as ""net neutrality,"" ""Internet freedom"" or the ""open Internet,"" these rules protect your ability to go where you want when you want online. Broadband service providers cannot block or deliberately slow speeds for internet services or apps, favor some internet traffic in exchange for consideration, or engage in other practices that harm internet openness.

**How do FCC rules protect the Open Internet?**

The FCC's Open Internet rules protect and maintain open, uninhibited access to lawful online content. The rules specifically prohibit:

- Blocking: Broadband providers may not block access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices.
- Throttling: Broadband providers may not deliberately target some lawful internet traffic to be delivered to users more slowly than other traffic.
- Paid prioritization: Broadband providers may not favor some internet traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind.  Internet service providers are also banned from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.

The rules also put in place standards going forward to ensure that ISPs cannot engage in new or different practices—outside those three prohibitions—that would cause similar harms to the open internet.  

The rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service to protect your internet access.

In May 2017, the FCC initiated a new proceeding to assess whether the current rules are the best approach to Internet freedom. We are currently taking public comments on the issue, and more information can be found at https://www.fcc.gov/restoring-internet-freedom

**Testing your broadband speed and comparing services**

FCC rules require broadband providers to be transparent about the services they offer and to provide sufficient information to empower you to make informed choices – including choices about speed, price, and network management practices. The rules also require that providers' information about their broadband service must be accurate and truthful.  The FCC reports periodically on service providers’ broadband service: www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america. The FCC also encourages the public to test broadband speeds using publically-available, free, online tests and to test mobile broadband with our smartphone app: www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america/mobile.

**FCC Ombudsperson**

The Ombudsperson also is available to assist consumers, businesses, and organizations with Open Internet complaints and questions.  The Ombudsperson can be reached at: **ombudsperson@fcc.gov or 202-418-1155.**
