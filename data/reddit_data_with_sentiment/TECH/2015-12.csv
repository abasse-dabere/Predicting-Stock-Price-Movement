technology,I got a formal response from my FCC complaint to Comcast.,"I don't recall my exact wording of the complaint. I wish I had saved it, but it was in regards to the data caps that Comcast is trialing.


In the letter I received they state


&gt;The FCC  has previously recognized that usage-based pricing for Internet service is a legitimate billing practice that may benefit consumers by offering them more choices over a greater range of service options.


They link an FCC document, the 2015 Open Internet Order, in the footer. And, yeah, the document does imply that in more than one sense.  The same document also has this to say about data caps as well.


&gt;Since the original transparency rule was promulgated, the
Commission has received hundreds of complaints regarding advertised rates, slow or congested services,
data caps, and *other potentially deceptive practices*.


While the FCC does recognize data caps as a business practice, it also very clearly calls it a ""deceptive practice"".  They also go on to say that data caps have potentially negative effects on consumers.


&gt;Data caps or allowances, which limit the
amount and type of content users access online, can have a role in providing consumers options and
differentiating services in the marketplace, but they also can negatively influence customer behavior and
the development of new applications


&gt; “even if providers
do not block content outright, providers can still utilize their market power to harm consumers in more subtle ways,
such as by lowering data caps or exempting their own services from such caps”


Another excerpt from the letter I received says

&gt;Comcast is trialing an innovative usage-based billing approach that relieves lighter end users from paying the same price as heavier end users, while enabling those heaver end users to continue using as much data as they want without being subjected to a hard cap


They go on to say that the median monthly usage over the last six months was 40 GB.  In images posted in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3rnfnm/leak_of_comcast_documents_detailing_the_coming/) thread from a little while back, in [this](http://i.imgur.com/Dblpw3h.jpg) image in particular, we see that the smallest data option in Tuscon, AZ is 300 GB.  So... if the average monthly data usage over the past *six months* was only 40GB, and this plan is about relieving ""lighter end users from paying the same price as heavier end users"", why is there not a 50 GB option significantly cheaper than the 300 GB option?  Wouldn't **that** be the fair thing to do in this case?


It's like if a city had a bunch of 1200 sq ft apartments for rent, and the average tenant only uses 500 sq ft of it.  Instead of giving them a smaller option to save money, they're just allowing them more room if they choose to have it.  That's still not fair. They're still paying for a bunch of space they're not using.  I know I'm trying to compare a limited floor plan with unlimited internet usage, but I hope you see my point here.


The letter concluded with contact information to a Comcast Customer Security Assurance rep, should I wish to call them back.  I'm sure plenty of you have gotten letters too in regards to your complaints, but I decided to do a little digging into mine and wanted to share my findings. It seems like Comcast is trying to hide behind the FCC's acknowledgment that data caps are a ""legitimate billing practice"" without fully understanding what the FCC believe about data caps.


Extra note:  I did a ctrl+f for ""legitimate"" in the Open Internet Order linked above. I didn't find any hit relating the word ""legitimate"" to data caps specifically, but I did find this.


&gt;In order to maintain flexibility, the Commission tailored the rules contained in the Open 
Internet Order to fit the technical and economic realities of the broadband ecosystem. To this end, the 
restrictions on blocking and discrimination were made subject to an exception for “reasonable network 
management,” allowing service providers the freedom to address legitimate needs such as **avoiding 
network congestion** and combating harmful or illegal content.


Sound familiar? We all learned with the [leaked documents](http://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg) that Comcast's data caps have nothing to do with avoiding network congestion.  This Open Internet Order seems to discuss ""legitimate network management"" practices as a whole in regards to what services broadband providers should be providing to end users.  The one thing I've taken from all of this is that the data caps have nothing to do with fairness.

320 * 4 * 60= 7.7 Megabytes per song

7.7 * 37,000,000= 285,000,000 Megabytes

technology,I emailed my Congressman about the net neutrality killing rider that's been attached in the stopgap funding bill. His response is some of the biggest horseshit I've read in a while and I wanted to share it with you all,"My Congressman's response:

I would like to thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I appreciate hearing about issues that are important to my constituents.
 
As you may know, net neutrality refers to the principle of the open and free internet. Under this principle Internet Service Providers (ISP) provide equal access to all lawful internet traffic, and consumers are free to choose what content they wish to access. The main focus of debate over net neutrality has been whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient for policy makers to address this issue, or whether they should look to Congress to amend current law.
 
Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed into law, new technologies and advancements in telecommunications have rapidly developed due to the limited government regulation of internet traffic and services. However, on February 26th, 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband Internet as a telecommunication service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This essentially allows the FCC to reclassify broadband as a utility giving the FCC more regulatory authority over Internet providers. 
 
Over the past 20 years the Internet has changed the way we live our lives, from how we get the news to how we pay our bills. Now the FCC is reaching back 80 years for their authority to reclassify broadband Internet service as a public utility, a move that will not only open the Internet up to heavier regulations and additional taxes, but would disincentive the development and deployment of faster Internet service throughout the nation. 
 
While President Obama and Chairman Wheeler continue their short sighted approach to net neutrality I hope to use my position as a member of the Communication and Technology Subcommittee to push for a bi-partisan solution that will help keep the internet open and free while incentivizing the build-out of broadband services and spurring innovation in the marketplace. The Subcommittee is currently discussing draft legislation, which I support, that would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit blocking lawful content, throttling data, and paid prioritization. Moving forward please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as we continue to work on this important issue.
 
Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. If you would like to keep up on this and other important issues you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter or sign up for my electronic newsletter.
 
 
Sincerely,

technology,"Now that CISA has passed, here are some tips to protect your Privacy, Anonymity, and Security (x-post from /r/YouShouldKnow)","***[PSA--Long post ahead. tl;dr for the first half of this: You might be getting spied on. Skip to the numbered part and I'll teach you how to protect yourself. I will not explain in detail how these things work in this post, because I want anyone, regardless of their tech prowess, to find these suggestions accessible. It is also because I am by no means an expert in this area, and do not wish to spread misinformation. Luckily, the information is readily available all over the net, if you would like to know more.]***

&gt; **(UPDATE 12/20/2015: I just want to point out that I am aware that a few of my suggestions have been disputed in the comments. I am *OKAY* with that. In fact, I *encourage* it. A few people seem to be getting heated, and there is just no reason for that. I am just some dude on the internet looking to help out. These are all just suggestions that work *for me*. I am sharing with you what I know. None of these tips will cause you any harm, I promise, though an alternative might suit *your* purposes better. Please, I implore you to take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong in the comments, but please be kind to one another. I will make updates and corrections as needed, so please check back now and again.)**

I promise, I am not as crazy and paranoid as this post is about to make me seem. This is just an important issue to me as a techy/geek. [This is important for you as well, I swear](http://www.zdnet.com/article/if-you-have-nothing-to-hide-heres-where-to-send-your-passwords/), so grab your tinfoil hats and come to [Crazy Town](http://www.weebls-stuff.com/other-toons/video/aaaaaaaaaaaaahaha.html) with me for a moment.

Basically, [CISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_Information_Sharing_Act) has been signed into law. For those that don't know what this means, many corporations and the Department of Homeland Security now have greater access to your online activity and can do with it what they will. There are scary implications of this that I could ramble about; but, honestly, they will *probably* never happen to you or I. But it's the principle of the thing that concerns me.

There are three important things that everyone should have a right to as a ""citizen of the internet"": *Privacy*, *Anonymity*, and *Security*. CISA is a blatant invasion of the first two, particularly Privacy. You do not have to be doing anything illegal to warrant a need to private access to the internet. You just simply should not be spied on. You are being violated. It doesn't matter if you're just returning an email to your grandma, or buying some shoes--there is no reason that your activity should be monitored, recorded, and passed around unless there is some solid evidence pointing to you extorting your grandma or stealing those shoes.

The legislation was [trojan-horsed](http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/house-senate-pass-budget-with-cisa/) in on a budget bill and signed off by the Prez himself, so nothing can be done to reverse it. At least not yet. The good news is, there are things *YOU* can do right now to maintain your rights. *All of the following tips are completely legal (in the USA), freely available, relatively simple to use, and within your rights to use as you wish.*

&amp;nbsp;

**[Pro tips begin here!]**

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Privacy:** Use a VPN service. [Cyberghost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us?utm_expid=85864364-18._HAGhHhTTvKkQRZylpXQXw.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and ~~TunnelBear~~ both offer excellent free services. If you want even better service, there are a few excellent paid services, as well (I don't know any well enough to endorse one, but I've heard good things about NordVPN. It's got 256-bit AES encryption and is completely logless). 

&gt; (**UPDATE:** It was brought to my attention that TunnelBear, while adorable, is not logless and is hosted within the USA. It is therefor not recommended for privacy. It's good if you want to get around a site blocker at work or school, but for REAL privacy, use a reputable paid VPN service. Regardless of arguments, though, the free version of Cyberghost *will* help you maintain Privacy. It is hosted out of the US, it is logless, and they make their revenue from paid subscriptions and will not sell your information. That is not to say that a paid service is not better, it's just that Cyberghost's free service will be safe for you to use.)

The merit of VPNs is debated around the internet, but I have found them to be indispensable in maintaining my own privacy, as they are quick and easy to connect to and are one of the simplest and most effective tools of allowing you to maintain your privacy. 

There are also small program switches you can make. For example, switch from Skype to [qTox](https://tox.chat/). It is a more steady, reliable program that offers all of the same services as Skype, but with excellent end-to-end encryption and it's logless, much like a good VPN. Your conversations will remain between you and the other person only. It's also available on a wide variety of platforms, so it should work for almost anyone. 

Also consider using a more secure email provider. If you want to keep it net-based, use ~~HushMail~~. If you like a client installed on your PC, combine your secure email account with a program called [ThunderBird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/), which allows you to easily manage multiple email accounts, among other cool, secure features. 

&gt; (**UPDATE:** I stand corrected. /u/theforcereturns was able to show me that HushMail is *NOT* your most secure option. A much better option, as per his recommendation, would be [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/). I've looked into it, and I will be making the switch myself. It's based out of Switzerland and has true end-to-end encryption, among other features that help to privatize and anonymity your email, PLUS--it's free. Super rad. The only downside is that as of now, you have to request an invite and wait for an account due to their need to expand the size of their servers.

&gt; He also wanted me to include some information regarding instant messaging. He recommended [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/) or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). Signal, in particular, as it was developed by a highly reputable team--however, it is only available for mobile devices. Telegram offers a client for PC, as well. I have personally used [Wickr](https://www.wickr.com/), and I know it to be very secure and reliable. 

&gt; If you MUST use Facebook Messenger (*which I do not recommend in the slightest*), then the best way to do it is to connect through [Pigdin](https://pidgin.im/) with the [OTR Plug-In](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) and the current [Messenger compatability](https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook/wiki#basic-usage). The only drag is that your other party MUST have this setup, too, and you will have to authenticate each other. But the plus is that your Facebook messages will be encrypted. Still though, either way, don't send sensitive messages over Facebook. Never. Never ever. Don't. Like... do not. Ever.

Another good idea is to reconsider the search engines you use. Google and Bing are notorious data compilers. I use ~~DuckDuckGo~~ instead. It's fast, accurate, and totally private and anonymous. They do not collect data on you. 

&gt; (**UPDATE:** Some redditors are claiming DuckDuckGo to be less-than-reputable. I can't confirm or deny that as of now, so in lieu of that, I suggest you check out [StartPage](https://startpage.com/) or [PrivateSearch.io](https://www.privatesearch.io/). Both are great, secure search engines. StartPage is slowly becoming my new personal favorite.)

I also want to mention (legal) File Sharing. I'd like to add that [BitDrop](https://bitdropapp.com/) is an awesome tool for anonymous, secure file sharing between your devices. As mentioned above, qTox also has secure file sharing capability.

You can also get a free [MEGA](https://mega.nz/#fm/c1UwVZAZ) account. While not the most secure, if you use Winrar or 7Zip to create an encrypted RAR file with a conspicuous name and send it over HushMail, Tox, etc. to your friend/receiver of the file separate from the decryption password/MEGA access code, it will be secure enough (for non-sensitive documents and files), and you can upload up to 50GB with a free account. Just remember to delete the files from your account AND the rubbish bin after the other party has received them. 

&gt; (**UPDATE:** MEGA is *NOT* to be used as a secure, private file sharing tool. Please see my second edit at the bottom of this post.)

Another option is to create a torrent file of the encrypted RAR file and seed it directly to the other party, after both of you have configured your torrent clients to run all traffic through a proxy.

If you're especially tech-savvy, you can even go so far as to install CFW on your router, provided it's supported, like [Tomato](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) or [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index). Tomato in particular will allow you to actively monitor your bandwidth activity to see who is accessing your network, or even just to see if Comcast is throttling your Netflix usage. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Anonymity:** Again, you don't have to be a criminal to want to keep your anonymity online. Download the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en). It's a modified version of Firefox that allows you to route all of your activity online through the Onion server network. *(Pro tip: Tor will not protect you when downloading or torrenting anything, legal or not. If you engage in a peer-to-peer download, you will inevitably upload real personal information about your system, AND it slows down the Tor network for everybody else. The safest way to download is through a [torrent client](http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=38?download) that has been [configured to work with a Proxy or VPN](https://www.bolehvpn.net/utorrent.html), but nothing is guaranteed. [Here](http://samair.ru/) is a list of free public proxy servers you may use. Always check the validity of your proxy server [here](http://samair.ru/s-proxychecker/index.php) before each use).* 

(Please note that I **DO NOT** condone piracy or illegal activity of **ANY KIND**. I am simply suggesting uTorrent as a means of securely sharing legally obtained or created files between two parties.)

&gt; (**UPDATE:** Yes, recent versions of uTorrent have been shown to include spyware. Settle down. The version that I linked to above is version 2.2.1, arguably the best version of uTorrent, more lightweight, and spyware free. If you want to forego uTorrent entirely, go with [qBittorent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/), an open source bittorent client that I personally use in addition to uTorrent. It's excellent. A lot of redditors have also recommended Deluge, which looks promising, but I have never used it personally.)

Also, NEVER open a downloaded file while still connected to Tor, especially a PDF. There are often traces of data that ""call home"" when the file is opened, and it can void any protection Tor offers you.

It's also good practice to visit HTTPS versions of sites whenever possible, as they are more secure. The Tor bundle includes a browser plug-in called [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) that will automatically get you the most secure connection to sites whenever possible. You can also add it to your regular Chrome, Firefox, or Opera browsers, and on Android devices.

You might also consider [spoofing your MAC address](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Spoof-Your-MAC-Address/) now and again. 

&gt; (**UPDATE:** Spoofing your MAC is only necessary if you think your LAN has been compromised from the ""inside."" Otherwise, don't worry about it.)

The last thing I will say on anonymity, for the more tech-savvy again, is that you may consider using something like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to run a more secure operating system INSIDE of another operating system. You can also just install that more secure OS on a flash drive, but I find the VirtualBox to be easier to manage AND  that it provides more anonymity. I personally would recommend using [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox) with VB. It's very effective. I've also heard good things about Tails, but apparently it's not truly logless, and I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it, as I have never used it.

Finally, it's important to know your stuff is working. To test my level of anonymity, I like to use [IP Check](http://ip-check.info/?lang=en) and [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Security:** Not really relevant to CISA, but it's important, too. ~~Ditch McAffee, Kaspersky, or whatever junk you paid for.~~ Download [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/lp/sem/?sfc=sem-gs_b_us_en&amp;gclid=CMCSvNKO6ckCFY9gfgodrZED8Q), [Panda Antivirus](http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/free-antivirus/), and [CCleaner](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download). 

&gt; (**Update:** Just to clarify, CCleaner is NOT an antivrus, and I do not claim that it is. Clearing your registry is just a good practice for security and in general.) 

All free, all easy to use, all great at what they do. Just allow them to update regularly and run automatic scans each night. If you prefer paid software, Kaspersky has the highest detection rate and is super reliable software. There are other good options, as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**Final Notes:** These are just *BASIC* tips to help you protect yourself. This will not make you invisible; if someone still wants to spy on you, they could... but they'll actually have to work for it. There's a lot more you can do to abstract your digital ""fingerprint"". But either way, care about your privacy. Protect yourself. As far fetched as it seems, due to the nature of the issue, the more people that do this stuff, the more secure everyone becomes (especially in regards to Tor use).

&gt;*""Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.""* -- Edward Snowden

&amp;nbsp;

~~/Wall of text~~ *Apparently not....*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **EDIT:** A lovely anonymous user posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3xj5fe/now_that_cisa_has_passed_here_are_some_tips_to/cy52yyp) with links to further reading, if you're interested. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **EDIT: PART DEUX:** Some redditors have pointed out a few things to be wary of that I should have included in the original post. Later versions of uTorrent have been found to come with spyware. The version I linked to is an older version (2.2.1) and it safe for you to use. If you want to forego uTorrent altogether, qBittorent is an excellent alternative, that I use myself on occasion. It's completely open source, which is groovy, too. 

&gt; Also, MEGA is NOT by any means a secure way of file sharing. I meant to say that if it is NOT a particularly sensitive document you're sending, and it's encrypted, it works in a pinch. Please do not rely on it for secure sharing. There are some good recommendations below in the comments for you to investigate. I won't name any specific ones, as I have not tested them myself. 

&gt; Also Also, one user (I lost his name in the vast ocean that is my inbox--I now I understand what ""RIP My Inbox"" means--but as soon as I find it again, I will credit you, kind stranger) pointed out that unless you select the options to ENCRYPT the email you send with HushMail, it will only send through the clearnet as a normal email and will NOT be secure. Don't forget to encrypt your emails, kids.

&gt; Finally, I just want to make it clear, NONE of this will make you ""invisible."" It simply helps to scatter the information that makes up you ""fingerprint"" to A) Make it less reliable to track you with, and B) to give up less personal data to prying eyes. *YES* the contents of you hard drive are probably compromised if you're not using Whonix or Tails. *YES* the NSA can still watch you if they want to. IF someone REALLY wants to get to you, especially the govt., they still can. This isn't a guide to disappearing completely. This is a guide for the average Joe or Jane, who are not cybercriminals, to regain their privacy online. This won't save you if you're trafficking drugs, but it WILL keep a substantial amount of nosey trackers off your back and help you regain your privacy.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **HE'S EDIT AGAIN:** Holy *shit* this post blew up. First of all, THANK YOU for gold, kind stranger. That is awfully kind. I luh you.

&gt; Second, a lot of people are discussing what I recommended for ""Security."" First of all, I said straight up, it basically has nothing to do with CISA. It's just something I believe to be a fundamental right as an internet user and wanted to include. But I also apologize for referring to paid anti-virus software as ""junk."" Most of it is not junk, I do not mean to confuse you. I used Kaspersky for a year or two back in 2011 or so, and it was great. A lot of those programs have a lot to offer, and they work very well. For my purposes, the free anti-virus software does everything I need it to do and more, so it is not worth it to pay for the software. Your purposes may be different, and at the end of the day, it's all about what works for you. So, no, paid antivirus software is not junk. I apologize for the misrepresentation.  

&gt; It should also be noted that spoofing your MAC is JUST for if you think you have been compromised from within your own LAN network. 

&gt; As I stated before, I am no expert. Just a guy who has done a lot of research on his own, trying to do a solid for his fellow internet-users. Everything I suggest is just that--a suggestion. It's what works for me based off the research I have done. I encourage you to take my advice with a grain of salt and do research on your own to see what works for you. But I would venture to say that what I have written is a solid starting point on your journey to a more private, anonymous, and secure browsing experience. Serve hot with a side of common sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **EDIT EPISODE IV: A NEW DNS SERVER:** Your DNS server. Change that shizz. I recommend [DNS.Watch](https://dns.watch/index). A redditor (who's name I'll have to hunt down) recommended it to me, I've played with it, and it's great so far. OpenDNS is also good. DON'T use Google DNS. I did for a long time. It's effective, but they absolutely store and use your DNS look-up records. If you use Google's, drop it now.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE US WONDERING IF THIS AFFECTS THEM:** Yes. And no. Yes, if you visit sites hosted in the US, but no, the legislature itself does not extend beyond the US border, as I understand it. Your country may or may not have it's own laws regarding the matter.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **MORE INFORMATION:** These are some comments that I felt were worth noting, because of some excellent information that was brought up.

&gt; I'll probably add more as I sift through the comment section. There's a lot, and I am only one man, no matter how many fake mustaches I own.

gadgets,[Rule announcement] We are changing some things up in a big way in our fight against spam,"Hello gadget fanatics! 

Here in /r/gadgets we have to deal with **a lot** of spam, on a daily basis we remove a lot of submissions from sketchy domains, ad ridden blogs, etc. Unfortunately we can't always be around (in case you did not know, subreddit mods are volunteers) meaning that a spammy submission will be caught a bit late. 
A little bit too often these submissions reach our frontpage. 
This because of vote manipulation or sometimes just because spammers are really good at making attractive titles, making use of the fact that a sizeable amount of people don't actually read the articles behind them.
It isn't surprising that one of the major points in feedback we receive is the presence of spam on this subreddit. 
To combat this our rules have become ever more restrictive and automod, as well as some other scripts, more trigger happy. 

Unfortunately this also means that a lot of legitimate submissions and users got caught in the crossfire, something a lot of you and us as well are not all too happy about. 

# Introducing the accepted domains white list
Because of that we have sat down and after some brainstorming decided to switch things around. From now on every submissions will be held for review **unless it is on our white list of accepted domains**. If the website you submit is not on the white list you will receive a message from the bot asking to check up on our rules and then message us for review. 

## What domains will be on the white list? 

We have made an initial list of well known and acceptable tech websites, manufactures and general news websites. Over time we will review the list and submissions to /r/gadgets and add those domains that consistently are approved after review. Here is the important bit though, we also want **your input**! Every month we will post a list feedback thread, in that thread people can discuss the allowed domains and suggest domains that should be on the white list. 
We will use the input from those monthly threads to further finetune the list. 

**[You can find the complete list here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist)**

## What benefits will this have for /r/gadgets? 

We see several benefits to this approach: 

- A lot less (blog)spam visible for you.
- Less restrictive rules. A lot of the rules are aimed at reducing spam, since we can catch it much sooner now we can loosen up some rules. To be more specific, we can be much looser in enforcing the rules we have now.
- Less skynet, we currently have a lot of automoderator rules aimed at reducing spam that also catch genuine users. We can now remove those rules and remove the confusion for many users where automod pulled something where it was not needed. 

## Are all articles from white listed domains allowed? 

No, although we will look at loosening up some rules the content you submit still has to follow those we have in place.

## Are only submissions from white listed domains allowed? 

No, it just means that submissions from domains not on the list will need to be reviewed *before* being visible for everyone in the subreddit.

## I still don't like it! 

Well that is very unfortunate, the policy we implement is aimed at solving a lot of the feedback we received in the past year. Unfortunately with a user base in the millions it is impossible to make everyone happy. Of course we are happy to hear any suggestions you have, it is how we ended up with this post :)",42,121,2015-12-26,TECH,0.08066783845424652,0.8939862251281738,0.0253459420055151
