So I went ahead and built one, its live at [www.smugg.com.](http://www.smugg.com) I've been aggregating new tech products for the past month, but I haven't told many people about it. 

To make accessing the content as simple as possible, I have setup a twitter account that relays published products. E.g. a tweet would be ""Macbook Air. 12 Critic Reviews. 86%"". If this is useful, then please go ahead and follow: [http://twitter.com/smuggdotcom ](http://twitter.com/smuggdotcom  ) 

If there are other ways you think i should make available e.g. google+ feed, then let me know and i'll setup it on the site.
