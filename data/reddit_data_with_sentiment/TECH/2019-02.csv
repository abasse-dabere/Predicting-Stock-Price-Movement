technology,"With the recent Chinese company, Tencent, in the news about investing in Reddit, and possible censorship, it's amazing to me how so many people don't realize Reddit is already one of the most heavily censored websites on the internet.","I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&amp;#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit. 

EDIT: Guess I should mention a few notables:

technology,I'm a neuroscientist / former brain bank manager who's developing an app to help researchers spend less time glued to microscopes in the lab. Ask me anything!,"Hello reddit,

I'm Dr Matthew Williams, a neuroscientist in the UK who has recently been developing [Segmentum Imaging](https://segmentumanalysisltd.com/), an attempt to move the slow and cumbersome methods of cell measurement into a more streamlined and neat system that you can use on a mobile device (meaning you can do it while lying in bed, watching TV or in the bar, rather than in a room with no windows and awful fluorescent lighting). We're hoping to launch our first version soon and are looking for people to try it and let us know what they think, or just people who've been stuck in lonely microscope rooms for untold hours to say what sort of features they'd like on such a system.  

What's my background, though? 

So after being a regular old neuroscientist for a few years I went up to full-on creepy neuroscientist when I inherited a huge human brain bank - a brief overview of this was described in a [Cracked article a few years ago](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1402-pe-brain-bank.html). More recently I got some very minor proxy fame in this parish by finding a tropical-spider egg sack on a banana and taking it to the local arachnid lab (as documented in a series of posts by /u/lagoon83, who's helping me stay on top of the AMA this evening: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/a0tvbb/midlands_uk_partners_brother_found_this_in_the/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/a1mf97/update_spiderlab_got_back_to_us_with_a_photo_of/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/adgsmj/update_the_banana_spiders_from_a_month_ago/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/aqnkyc/another_update_the_banana_spiders_from_a_couple/)). 
More recently, as well as developing some digital biotech as a startup, I'm now working on creating another brain bank - but this time, for much of the animal kingdom as part of an international collaboration.

As suggested by the mods, I've posted this ahead of time so people can start adding comments - I'll be  on here from 6pm GMT (1pm EST) and will stick around for a few hours to answer any questions you have about our app, digital pathology, my background, neuroscience in general, and whether I've summoned the strength of will to eat a banana recently. 

Ask me anything!   

EDIT:  OK thanks everyone.  I'm off for the night but will check back over the next few days and reply to any other questions.",308,256,2019-02-16,TECH,0.035655226558446884,0.9287243485450745,0.035620421171188354

Sorry for the dutch article.

I could not find an english article.

Some highlights:

\- Energy is generated from a solar panel that outputs hydrogen

\- Efficiency is currently at 15%. Current (household) solar panel tech is at around 18-20%

\- The panel is made out of cheap, durable parts. No expensive, rare materials are needed.

\- No more batteries needed for storage. For household use, a tank can be put underground, which can be used in the winter, when solar output is low.

\- Household trials are starting as soon as possible
