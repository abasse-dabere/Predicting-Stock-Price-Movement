FCC is considering a proposal to require manufacturers to lock down computing devices (routers, PCs, phones) to prevent modification if they have a ""modular wireless radio"" or a device with an ""electronic label"". 

The rules would likely:

* Ban installation of custom firmware on your Android phone
 
* Restrict installation of alternative operating systems on your PC, like GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc.
 
* Prevent research into advanced wireless technologies, like mesh networking and bufferbloat fixes

* Discourage the development of alternative free and open source WiFi firmware, like OpenWrt
 
* Infringe upon the ability of amateur radio operators to create high powered mesh networks to assist emergency personnel in a disaster.
 
* Prevent resellers from installing firmware on routers, such as for retail WiFi hotspots or VPNs, without agreeing to any condition a manufacturer so chooses.",25,95,2015-09-03,TECH,0.15455080568790436,0.8253678679466248,0.02008133754134178

technology,"Imgur, Reddit's popular image hosting site, just greatly reduced user anonymity, so let's talk online privacy and security.","Please read Imgur CEO's reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3l2gpu/imgur_reddits_popular_image_hosting_site_just/cv2xmb7).

-----

I wanted to share this since it kinda goes hand in hand with IT and tech, especially considering that pretty much everyone on Reddit uses Imgur for hosting. Let me know if there is a better sub to post this. 

Imgur has recently silently introduced a rather important change to their layout which affected the anonymity of the site for those who have an active account there. 

From now on, all images that ever been uploaded to an imgur account now have that account name displayed [above the image](http://i.imgur.com/uNAnl3p.png). That means that if you link, or have ever linked, an image from your account to anyone, they will be able to backtrace it to your entire account and see your other public images, comments and favorites. It's rather important to be aware of this as it has several issues.

**First** of all, ANY image linked outside imgur that is stored on your imgur account now leads to your profile, where anyone can see your comments, opinions, other images and favorites. This creates following scenarios:

* Wanted to share a pic with someone you don't know? They now have your entire imgur account where there can be possible identifying information. Not even to mention all the nudes people display online, that they might not want linked to their full profile.

* Sent a vacation pic to your dad? If he clicks on profile, he will find your furry porn favorites.

* Shared an image with a conservative family? Someone discovered your atheist comments.

**Secondly**, when sharing images online on other sites, it can doxx you really hard. Say you have two Reddit accounts from both of which you link images. One is called The_True_Swede, other is Shitposter101. If you link an image from Shitposter101, and it's uploaded to imgur profile The_True_Swede, your jig is up. Or it can connect just two anonymous Reddit profiles continuously linking to same imgur profile. 

**Thirdly**, tying in with above, maybe you have an imgur profile where you are open with who you are, and then a different Reddit account on which you post to say alcoholics anonymous. If you share a pic uploaded to your imgur account on Reddit, someone can find your real info there and blackmail you/call your work.

**Lastly**, which they been doing for a while, is that if you upload an image to imgur account and share it on Reddit only, it will be submitted against your will to imgur public gallery and display your profile name. This creates same issues as outline in the above three points, linking your Reddit account to imgur account. 

This is not something uncommon, many sites have user accounts. Problem is, even if you directly link an image to someone, as long as they have the image ID from the url, they can just remove the file format at the end, giving them full image info and profile name. This also applies to all previous images stored on the account. Yup, even that dick pic you uploaded to it a year ago which is now floating around the internet.

----------

In short: You can no longer anonymously share images from your imgur account, without them linking back to the account and the rest of content on it.

The simplicity and privacy of imgur is what made is so great, such as it stripping all meta data from images you uploaded, and them not being linked to your account when viewed. It feels now that imgur is moving in opposite direction which is a bit worrying. 

So in the end, just be aware of this change when using imgur, if you have an active imgur account and don't want it traced. 

What are your thoughts regarding this development? It seems imgur is trying to move more and more away from being an image host towards a community, while sacrificing user privacy in the progress. 

What privacy can we expect from online communities as they develop? The whole social aspect seems to be all the rage now, and many websites are moving towards it. Can we expect some different directions from site that are about sharing and hosting?

Is privacy simply too much to expect from online communities, or a basic thing they all should revolve around?

**Edit**: ""Couldn't you just log out?"" Yes I could and I will from now on. More annoying image management aside however, many users, including me, already have hundreds of images linked to the account and many are not even be aware of the change. So hey, the more you know.

**Edit 2**: A workaround for **recent** images is to ""hide"" them through your profile over at http://USERNAME.imgur.com/all/, hover over images there and press red cross, select those you want to hide, and click ""hide"" at top. That unlinks them from your account. That however only applies to recent images you can still find in your uploads, good luck finding all those pics from years ago and remember which ones you linked. And most people are not even aware of the issue/fix. 

**Edit 3:** CEO of imgur addressed the issue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3l2gpu/imgur_reddits_popular_image_hosting_site_just/cv2xmb7). To me, this seem like a weird approach as it disregards the supposed privacy of millions already uploaded images under the previously assumed privacy - now all linking back to your account when previously that was not the case. I outlined the issues in a reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3l2gpu/imgur_reddits_popular_image_hosting_site_just/cv39yct).

After a full day of talking with everyone, I’ve uncovered a lot of different opinions on how this should work, and a lot of unique use-cases for Imgur. The goal of the update was to create a more consistent, unified, and overall awesome experience, and included in it was better attribution to users, where the username appeared on all Imgur uploads.

It’s important to note, this update did NOT make private images public, but it did make is so that private images linked back to a user’s public account activity, like comments, images and albums that they shared with the Imgur community. 

We heard through the feedback the concerns about how the username change impacts historical posts, specifically how direct links could be linked to a user’s public profile. People have come to use Imgur in so many ways that we decided it’s necessary to roll back our update and take some time to work through how private, public and published posts relate to one another on Imgur.

I just want to let you know that I really value your guy’s opinions, and I love hearing the feedback (Imgur was built off this feedback), and I think this is one of those cases where you guys taught me something new about how you use Imgur and so we’re undoing what we did.

Some people are reporting that Malwarebytes is blocking Imgur. 

EDIT:

Imgur has fixed the exploit.

http://imgur.com/blog/2015/09/22/imgur-vulnerability-patched/

Post before the edit...

Here is the thread where it was first discovered 

https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3lutoo/imgur_is_doing_fishy_things_with_4chan_screencaps/

This is the image OP posted explaining what he found

http://puu.sh/kjvLI/f57b37ccc0.png

When an Imgur image is loaded from /r/4chan, imgur loads a bunch of images from 4chan's content delivery network or 8chan (unclear at this point, might be both), which causes a DDoS to those sites.

See this picture: https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3lutoo/imgur_is_doing_fishy_things_with_4chan_screencaps/cv9j7n0

You should only see one image loaded in that list, not all of those.

(This what a normal Imgur image looks like when it is loaded https://imgur.com/Hd6QEkl. See that only the one image is loaded, not 500 random ones. The injected.js is just a chrome extension.)

Basically, clicking on a Imgur link on /r/4chan ends up opening ~500 links from 4chan.org/8chan.

Looks like imgur is addressing the issue. https://twitter.com/imgur/status/646109824342593536",2169,6353,2015-09-22,TECH,0.035431332886219025,0.9376780986785889,0.026890583336353302

Until this is fixed I recommend you do what is suggested in that post, and try not to use imgur until this whole debacle is over.
