Sure, there are a few things I can think of that might be interesting (an Arduino starter kit for one) but I'd like to hear some suggestions in case there is something awesome out there that I haven't heard of!

What's your favourite gadget that a guy in Canada can get in his hands for $50?

I look forward to hearing suggestions!

**EDIT**: I should probably mention that $50 is an arbitrary self-imposed limit, so if you know of something amazing that's anywhere up to $100 please suggest it and I'll decide if it's worth it on my own...

**DOUBLE EDIT**: Okay, so this thread exploded since I last checked it. I apologize but I'm not going to read all of these comments right away, I'll probably peruse them over the next couple of days. I definitely appreciate all the suggestions! As for everyone who is PMing me about lasers: I'm hesitant to give you a recommendation because if you don't do some reasearch on your own you'll probably end up blinding yourself or burning your house down. You shouldn't even consider buying a high powered laser unless you know exactly what they're about! Do some research, make google your friend! By the time you know enough to use the laser safely you'll know what you want to order! Have fun!",726,445,2014-06-30,TECH,0.023860342800617218,0.9250771403312683,0.05106249079108238
