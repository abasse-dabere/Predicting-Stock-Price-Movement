technology,The FCC claims that they received a DDOS attack at the exact same time as John Oliver's viral net neutrality segment last night,"UPDATE: The FCC is [now claiming](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/08/john-oliver-net-neutrality-238132) that it was also hit by a DDoS attack back in 2014, the last time John Oliver did a segment about net neutrality. This makes me even more skeptical. These are serious claims -- they need to show us the proof. The only way we'll know what really happened is if the FCC released their logs to an independent party who can verify their claims.

UPDATE 2: Now we are pretty sure the FCC is lying. Our software dev has confirmed that the FCC's site [went down again](http://imgur.com/a/cALQp) last night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment would have aired again on HBO. He also confirmed that their servers repeatedly fell down under net neutrality comments coming through [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com) over the last two weeks. It seems extremely likely the FCC is attempting to cover up the fact that their comment system simply cannot handle large amounts of feedback from the public. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  just issued a [press release](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344764A1.pdf) claiming, “Beginning on Sunday night at midnight, our analysis reveals that the FCC was subject to multiple distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS).” 

The FCC is saying that the site hosting their comment system was attacked *at the exact same time* comments would have started flooding in from John Oliver’s viral Last Week Tonight [segment about net neutrality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak). The media [widely reported](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/john-oliver-tackles-net-neutrality-again-crashes-fcc-comments-site-again/) that the surge in comments crashed the FCC’s site. 

Disclosure: I am a a net neutrality activist and I work for [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) one of the groups behind [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com). I have been paying close attention to the issue since 2014, and have been part of efforts that [overwhelmed](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-fcc-website-net-neutrality-20140715-story.html) the FCC’s comment site in the past. 

The FCC’s statement today raises two concerns for me. It strikes me that either:

1. The FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to access their site through John Oliver’s GoFCCYourself.com redirect amounts to a “DDoS” attack, to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, or—worst case—is preparing a bogus legal argument that somehow John Oliver’s show *itself* was the DDoS attack.

2. Someone actually did DDoS the FCC’s site at the exact same time as John Oliver’s segment, in order to actively prevent people from being able to comment in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules  many of us fought for in 2015.

Given the current FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s [open hostility](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance) toward net neutrality, and the telecom industry’s [long history](https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of astroturfing and paying [shady organizations](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments) to influence the FCC, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet. 

One thing that we can do right now is call for the FCC to release its logs to independent security analysts so that we know what actually happened. The public has a right to know. You can email the FCC’s Chief Information Officer asking for them to do this at &lt;David.Bray@fcc.gov&gt; or call 202-418-2020",284,4926,2017-05-08,TECH,0.0940406545996666,0.88526451587677,0.020694881677627563

To find the filing, head to: http://gofccyourself.com , then click on ""17-108"" on the left of the list to look at the list of comments.

What I am seeing is that bots are spamming the comments with fictitious and potentially illegal comments. How can I tell?

1. The names are sequential, and this pattern is likely to change once someone discovers this. Sequential as in the last name increases alphabetically as you go through the submissions.
2. They say the exact same thing every single time.
3. The posts are one after the other done in batches.
4. This pattern is improbable and inhuman, especially at this scale.

Just take a look:

technology,Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.",2607,112922,2017-05-23,TECH,0.1265784054994583,0.8554638028144836,0.017957746982574463

* I worked for a Fiber provider for a couple years, and the other big issue is unless you are an old Telecom Company(Which the company I worked for was), you either have to buy one out, or lease the rights to lay lines from the CABLE COMPANIES THEMSELVES. That's why the barrier to entry is so high, and why we don't have more options in the first place. The new law **Does nothing to fix that**.

technology,Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well,"FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)
* Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811)
* Sen. John Thune (R-SD)  (Twitter: [@johnthune](https://twitter.com/johnthune); phone: 202-224-2321)
* Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS)  (Twitter: [@RogerWicker](https://twitter.com/rogerwicker); phone: 202-224-6253)
* Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Twitter: [@SpeakerRyan](https://twitter.com/speakerryan); phone: 202-225-3031)
* Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)  (Twitter: [@CathyMcMorris](https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris); phone: 202-225-2006)
* Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA)  (Twitter: [@RepTomGraves](https://twitter.com/reptomgraves); phone: 202-225-5211)
* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.
