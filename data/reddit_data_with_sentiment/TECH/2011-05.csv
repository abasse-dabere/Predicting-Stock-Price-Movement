technology,It's 2011.  I am tired of my coworkers asking me questions that any 5 yr old could answer.,"IT Support Specialist at a multinational litigation firm, here.  

I just get so many stupid questions, every day, from the same handful of people in my office...and at times I really just have to sit here and wonder, *how are we ever going to advance as a civilization, if so many people can't even learn the most BASIC procedures on a simple computer?*

Things I have to show people how to do on a regular basis:

*save a file from an email

*attach a file to an email

*print

*select a printer

*make text bigger

*""make screen bigger"" (aka choose lower resolution...I would call that making the screen smaller, but I guess I can leave that open for debate)

*file search

*insert a picture into Word


here's one of my favorites:

 ""Can you set up this laptop for me?""  
  - Oh, you mean open it up and turn it on?  Here you go, idiot.  


Another:

""It won't let me save to this disk.""  
  - That's because you don't have a CD burner on your machine, and even if you did, using the ""File &gt; Save"" procedure isn't really how you do it anyway.  


The best example, and this has happened at least 5 times:

""My screen says 'No Source Detected' - help!""

**Is your computer turned on?**

""Yes.  Ha, ha.  Very funny.  Can you come help me?""

&lt;this is when I walk over there&gt;

**Here.  Your computer isn't turned on.  This is a monitor, *this* is a computer.""**

""Oh gosh, I feel stupid.""     THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE STUPID.


There's a lady who kept trying to put a CD into a floppy drive.  The list goes on.
I mean, these are people who spend their entire day sitting in front of a computer.  Is it too much to ask that they learn the basics?  Things like...you don't have to click something 7 times to open it.  Sometimes, it's a good idea to restart your computer.  Black and white printers don't print in color.  How can you spend 40 hours a week using a machine, for YEARS, and still not know what a USB is?  How?  How is it possible that you spend 40 hours a week, for YEARS, with your right hand on a mouse, and **still not know what RIGHT-CLICK means???**

Is it like this everywhere?  Should I just give up hope for humanity?  How are we ever going to invent flying cars or interstellar space travel if so many of us don't know that Ctrl+C = copy, Ctrl+V = paste?   

And why, WHY do almost ALL of the people I mentioned in my office have smart phones?  They don't even know how to set up their email on them - I have to do that for them.  They don't know how connect them to a wireless hotspot.  What in the name of *both of Odin's ravens* makes them think they need a phone capable of doing anything other than making phone calls?  This guy has an iPhone 4, doesn't even have music on it.  No apps.  Two ladies have Androids WAY nicer than mine - again, no music, no apps.  

At the end of every day, I just go home and drink beer and try to forget that the next day I have to go back and swim in this pool of hopelessness.

I want to get a tablet when I visit Singapore this summer (June, maybe). I am torn between getting an iPad 2 or an Android tablet (preferably the new Galaxy Tab). 

I'll primarily use it for school work, Internet and pretty much everything else. I'd like to have free apps as far as possible for most of the stuff I do. I'd like a free office suite (or at lease basic editors). 

I know that Android has more free apps than paid ones on the Marketplace, unlike iOS. But which one do you think would be better for school work if I want mostly free apps?

I want something that probably has 1-2 internal SATA bays (drives not included) capable of a RAID configuration  (if 2 drives) with 3-4 USB ports.  I'd also like something that has a relatively low power consumption or WOL or something like that.  Ideally this is to help save energy costs and make network sharing a bit easier.

I've kind of been checking these out over the past year and most seem to be okay, but non very great.  Either spotty network drivers, bad interface, etc.  However, I came across this one on Newegg today that got get pretty good reviews.  Any thoughts on it or other suggestions?

  ** CRISIS AVERTED**
....

....



Old update:

     
      


He was unsure why the PS3 Netflix program said any material was expiring, but said that they will usually hear about shows that will be leaving (specifically mentioning Showtime shows), but they hadn't heard anything about Viacom officially pulling content.  

He said he knew about instantwatcher.com and admitted he really likes the site personally, but hadn't heard anything to confirm it.

The best way, according to the CSR, to know if a show is expiring or not is to look at the ""Instant Queue"" tab on their website.  If a show is going to expire, it will look like [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/yVQV5.png) with red text under the notes section. 

So, it appears that the Viacom Messiah *MAY* not rapture all their content from Netflix after all.  As such, I deleted the [other](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/hgr3t/ಠ_ಠ_netflix_losing_all_viacom_content_tomorrow_cc/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/hgq9r/netflix_losing_all_viacom_content_tomorrow/) so as not to spread misinformation anymore.",175,619,2011-05-22,TECH,0.0707269012928009,0.907605767250061,0.0216673631221056

gadgets,Is there a tablet which is responsive enough that it could replace your pen and paper?,"I would love next year in uni to be able to use a tablet to take notes as I am atrocious at filing my notes and remembering to print notes before classes and therefore I pretty much end up learning everything from a text book in the last week of class. 

Is there a tablet that can almost emulate a pen and paper and costs ~£200/$300. It would basically need to be fast enough that writing on it didn't end up dragging about 2 or 3cm behind and detailed enough to be able to draw diagrams on. 

The [HTC Flyer](http://www.htc.com/uk/product/flyer/specification.html) seems ideal but costs a fortune (£400 at least). I'm open to suggestions of tablet type netbooks too. Also Uni doesn't start again until October so there is no rush and I can wait for a cheaper alternative/price drops due to new products coming out.


UPDATE: So it seems that traditional pen and paper can actually be replaced and there are many options to choose from, the future is indeed here, stop complaining about the lack of hoverboards.

* The [LiveScribe Echo](http://www.livescribe.com/en-gb/smartpen/echo/), very nice, not quite as flashy as a fancy tablet but none the less very impressive tech and definitely a great price too
* The [EEE Note](http://www.slashgear.com/asus-eee-note-sub-200-when-it-hits-us-imminently-25136136/), the slashgear review actually heralds it as an affordable alternative to the Flyer, if anyone knows where I can buy one I'm all ears.
* Think pad tablets seem quite popular too
* The [STYLISTIC Q550 Slate PC](http://www.shopfujitsu.com/Q550/index.php), much pricier but a bit more professional looking
* A netbook/laptop along with a graphics tablet actually sounds like a decent idea too, especially if you already have a laptop
* iPads with stylus work for some people
* Finally, the [NoteSlate](http://noteslate.com/), I don't want to hear about this product again until they begin offering free unicorns with their miracle product, the while the eee note deserves your respect and attention, this product just seems like some graphic designer has had a wet dream

technology,How the 3DS parallax barrier works,"I dont post really often and I was told this could be a good place to post this animation.

I made this little animation in mathematica to show how the parallax barrier works. The darker red and blue vertical lines on the left are two different images(one for each eye). The green lines are the barrier that lets only one eye to see the corresponding image. The black lines are the theoretical lines needed to maintain the 3D illusion as the head rotates around the display. When both lines are one on top of the other that is the perfect position and the brain mixes both images to create the 3D effect. As you can see, even if the technology is nice, its quite picky to make it work.

Edit: Any comment will be appreciated.

Edit 2: Added another animation. It shows how the barrier behaves as you move away from the display.",26,101,2011-05-29,TECH,0.04539518058300018,0.9216746687889099,0.032930150628089905
