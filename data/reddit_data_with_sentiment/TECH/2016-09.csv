I e-mailed customer service in case it was some error with my Prime account.  [According to the response, it was deliberate and the rep tried to sell it to me as just providing helpful information.](https://i.imgur.com/D44OKcI.png)  They also contradicted themselves by saying they don't want us to experience it, but apparently they do because this wasn't an error?

There are 2 reasons people pay for streaming services:

1. Streaming is convenient
2. No ads

Amazon is throwing away half of what makes their service good.
