technology,Very important (and hopefully final) update on the Fine Brothers React Trademark - From VideoGameAttorney,"Hey guys, 

Video Game Attorney (Ryan Morrison) here with an important update to the Fine Bros REACT trademarks. The Fine Brothers have sent me proof that they have abandoned or surrendered every trademark in question. They heard our collective voice, and they responded. There’s no reason to keep our foot on the gas.

Is what they did initially right? No, of course not. But I didn’t offer my services to destroy their company or see endless employees laid off, and I hope you didn’t join this fight for those reasons either. The internet gets hungry with vengeance, I know, but these are peoples’ lives. People who made a huge mistake, but a mistake they’ve corrected. 

I hope you let people who enjoy the Fine Bros work continue to do so. I hope you don’t troll their comment section or lead brigades against their content. They don’t own the react genre, but it would be silly to say they aren’t one of the best at it.  

So let’s give ourselves a round of applause, Internet. Things are as they should be. All is right in YouTube world. Now I’m off to help that Ant Simulator dev guy. 

Chat soon,
VGA

**EDIT:** To be clear, since a few have asked: This isn't some super secret proof you can't see. The USPTO's trademark search will update with the info in about four days. I've just seen the filing receipts so I can vouch for them they have done as said.",147,875,2016-02-02,TECH,0.037162020802497864,0.9218874573707581,0.04095054790377617

technology,"Morocco Bans WhatsApp, Skype, Viber and Other Services Providing Mobile Internet Calls","All three telecommunication service providers in Morocco have blocked free mobile internet calls in a sudden and unexpected move.

The block, which covers applications such as Skype, Viber, Facebook and WhatsApp calls, has been criticized by social media users across the country who have accused telecommunication service providers of being greedy.

Maroc Telecom, Meditel, and Inwi cut Voice over IP (VoIP) services without any notice in what has been described by one Moroccan columnist as a “legal” but “irrational and backward step”.

Morocco’s Telecommunications Regulatory National Agency (ANRT) said that none of the products providing VoIP or other ‘free internet calls’ had the required licenses.

“In addition of the losses for the telecoms national market, the free internet voice calls do not respond to the required legal gateway,” said ANRT in a statement on Thursday evening.

“Their suspension (VoIP) came in conformity with the operators’ obligations that were underlined in their licences.”

There are 10 million internet users in Morocco with Skype, WhatsApp and Viber being among the most used applications in the country.",135,1268,2016-02-28,TECH,0.0928589254617691,0.8835453987121582,0.023595651611685753
