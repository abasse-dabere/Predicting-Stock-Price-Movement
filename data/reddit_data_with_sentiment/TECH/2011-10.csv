gadgets,Advice on choosing a projector,"Hi there - this seems to be the most appropriate subreddit I can find for this question. 

I am hoping someone can help me out with choosing a 1080p projector, as I know little about them. I am mainly hoping to use it to watch movies and play PS3 games, with perhaps the odd sporting event thrown in.

The room is about 4m deep, and the projector will be mounted close to the ceiling at one end.

What sort of things should I be looking for? 
How good a projector can I expect to get for around the $AUD 2K mark.

To make things even more interesting, I am hoping to pay for it using a recent insurance payout, which would limit my choice of retailer. (I am in Australia if these retailers are not familiar)

Harvey Norman has the epson EH TW3500 (which seems to get a good rap) at $AUD 2K

Office Works has the Optoma EH1020 for just a bit more.

I can't find too much on this one, but I did see a review that suggested it is more of a data projector than home theatre – something about slow colour wheel?

Office Works also has the Benq W100 for $AUD 1.5K – how does it stack up?

What would you get in my situation? Are these reasonable options or should I forget it and get one from somewhere else?

I am thinking basically price of parts +100$ for labor, where I could build a very nice daily use desktop for 350 or so all together.

Even the ones that are a little better than that and say that he invented the desktop computer/Apple Computers still look really confused when I try to explain to them who Steve Wozniak is (Love the Woz, moreso after meeting him.). Point being that I'm reaching ""I don't want to live here anymore"" status when it comes to casual people crediting Steve Jobs for crap.

EDIT-I am not bashing Steve Jobs as a person or as a contributor to his field, I'm just merely annoyed at him getting credit for something he didn't do, which is not his fault, that's on the naive general populace.

gadgets,Need help picking a tablet/gadget for grandma for Christmas,"My wife's grandmother recently mentioned that she would like ""one of thos gadgets"" one of the other grand kids had. This was a Samsung galaxy tablet. 

So I am trying to find her a tablet for Christmas. I am debating between android and apple (iOS) for her to use. I am pretty sure that she wants to play spider solitaire on the couch and email. I don't think she will use it to browse the Internet or read books. Skype would be nice but is not required. 

Below are my thoughts on the two platforms. I am not trying to start a holy war between fanboys. I am looking to find the best option for grandma. 

Android
Lot of different options here. One of the benefits is that there are some lower cost options here. I am. Or sure what screen size to go with. I worry that 7 inch screen would be too small. I am looking at the amazon tablet because I like amazon (services, books,etc) and the price is reasonable. Anyone have one of these and like it? Are there some other good deals on android tablets? I worry about the ease of use for android for grandma. 

Apple
In the past for my parents I have suggested an iPad because I knew on the long run they would have less issues with it. Reduced the amount of tech support that I needed to provide them. I am wondering if the iPad larger size will be easier for her to read and use.  The iPad is a bit more than we would like to spend (splitting between two grand children). 

What say you Internet? What would you suggest?

***Update***
We decided to go with a refurbed Gen 1 iPad for grandma. Figure the iPad will be the easiest for her to use and we save some money by going gen 1 and refurb. Thank you everyone for your comments and opinions.

technology,YouTube eliminates your dilemma - no longer interrupts video when entering full screen,"The problem was that a normal embedded vid would normally start in 360p but as soon as you clicked full screen view, the resolution would jump up to 480p which made the video re-buffer. 

It is no longer a problem. As I noticed today, when you switch to fullscreen, for a few seconds you will still see 360p, while the better quality stream is probably buffered in the background, then almost unnoticeably  the quality improves. 

Now all we can ask for is implementation of auto Wadsworth constant.

EDIT: here's some proof..sort of..note the ""loading"" icon next to the 480p in bottom right corner:

[note that quality is still low, but it indicates that it's preparing for 480p]
