technology,Clinton hints that tech companies have compromised on encryption,"From last night's debate:

&gt; MITCHELL: But -- but -- Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.

&gt; CLINTON: That is not what I've heard. Let me leave it at that.

Isn't that the absolute worst answer? All things being equal, if there *were* some kind of deal about encryption, wouldn't it have been better to remain top-secret classified... rather than a person of authority publicly hinting at its existence?

Two obvious problems with this comment:

1) It sows suspicion that U.S. tech is *comprehensively* pwned. It entrenches the skepticism and skittishness of international companies over the security of our products. [Aren't we still dealing with the fallout of that perception?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/edward-snowden-tech-industry_n_4596162.html)

2) It encourages black-hats to go looking for them - specifically, for the kinds of back-doors that are typically intentional. I'm sure it would be deviously difficult to find, but [so was Juniper](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/researchers-solve-the-juniper-mystery-and-they-say-its-partially-the-nsas-fault/) (but security experts are very skilled), and [so was ECHELON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) (but it was leaked from inside), and [so was Stingray](https://www.rt.com/usa/325170-fbi-stingray-surveillance-hacking-computers/) (but the FBI and police are terrible at self-restraint), etc.

Granted, obscurity is not security, and there's a Moore's-law-like axiom (er... Schneier's Law?) that backdoors are eventually found. But if there *is* a backdoor, hinting at it and inviting people to go looking for it seems to expedite that eventuality.",32,141,2016-01-18,TECH,0.06058146432042122,0.9066916704177856,0.03272685781121254

technology,How to start a career in IT without going to college or technical school,"This got a lot of attention in another thread when i posted it to give someone tips so i thought id make a full thread about it.

A lil about me and my background so you can see where i came from and how this can work for anyone. I dropped out of high school and never went to college. I got my GED and worked in sales for 10 years. I hated it and always wanted to work in IT but didn't have the money or time for a tech school or college. I found out that alot of entry level IT jobs will take you with just certifications and you can just pay about 250 to take the test and that's it. so i did some research and found quite a few tools that are helpful in self studying i wanted to share.


Please understand that there are many ways to take to get into IT and many different types of jobs in IT. This route in particular is to become a network administrator, this is the path that I took. 

**Im not here to argue about the merits of college Vs. certifications, so please do not bother.**


Like i said before I had a background in sales and customer service prior to working in IT. This greatly helped me get into my first help desk position because i already had many skill sets that were pertinent to the position like phone etiquette and **PATIENCE**. If you plan on getting a job in a help desk environment i highly suggest starting with a simple customer service job while you are starting work on your studies.


Also, I showed this to a co worker of mine who went down a similar path and he told me about the WIA grant which is a government grant that pretty much anyone that is unemployed or making less than like 17k a year can qualify for. It gives you 12 thousand dollars in grant money that you can use at places like mycomputercareer.com (i dont recommend using them, that was just an example)
http://www.ehow.com/how_4927098_apply-wia-grant.html


**Comptia A+ certification.**

https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a 

This certification is focused on basic knowledge on both PC hardware and software. This is your starting point for even those of you that cant do much more than basic use. Even if you dont want to work in IT this is still a great way to learn the ins and outs of a PC just for personal use. It is broken up into two tests. The first is a test on hardware. It tests your general knowledge about pc hardware like what a motherboard is, it may have a picture of a motherboard and have you label what each part is, common TCP ports, etc. The website has a breakdown of all the info they are testing you on.

**www.professormessor.com**

 Start studying here. His videos are 100% free and he is amazing at breaking down the information and making it easy to understand. After each video there are 3 or 4 questions. Answer them and if you fail watch the video again.

**www.examcompass.com**

After you feel you have finished the videos go here to test your knowledge. A general rule of thumb is once you can get a 90 on each section you should be ready for the test.

**www.techexams.net**

The forum on this site has alot of really helpful people and is a great tool while studying.

**www.vue.com**

Once your ready to take the test go to pearson vue's website to find a testing center, schedule your test, and pay for it.

**get a entry level helpdesk job** 

After you have achieved your Comptia A+ certification you should look for entry level helpdesk/tech support work. This is all about building experience for your resume. These jobs typically pay around 15 an hour or so but can pay more depending on where you live and what type of work your doing. My first IT job was a helpdesk position and it started at $42k which is $20 an hour.


**Now you need to decide where you want to go in IT.** 

This guide will focus on the network\hardware side of things which is typically working on any of the hardware related issues anywhere from setting up workstations to working on routers and switches.

Some people stick with Comptia from here and get their Comptia N+. This is comptia's networking certificate. To do this follow the same steps as the A+ above just study the N+ info.
Alot of people find the N+ unecessary and go right into Cisco certification. This is what i did, a cisco cert makes the N+ pretty pointless as it is more advanced.

From here on we will be discussing Cisco certs.

**Cisco CCNA**

Cisco certification is alot harder than comptia. The cisco CCNA is said to have a less than 20% pass rate. Its the only cert test i ever failed and had to retake (failing sucks hard because you have to pay those fees again)

The first cisco certification is the Cisco CCNA or CCENT.
When taking the first cisco certification you have two options. you can either take 1 test which covers all the material, or you can take 2 tests which splits the material in half. I highly suggest taking the split test because there is ALOT of information to cover. The split test still gives you a CCENT certificate for completing the first test. Just make sure if you go this route to not stop until you have your CCNA because recruiters will ask you about it if you have a CCENT.

For studying I highly suggest using Jeremy Ciora's CBT nuggets he is an amazing instructor 

https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco-training

It does come at a cost (if your ok with pirating you can bittorent his videos.)

You also need to use a program to simulate routing and switching. I recommend packet tracer as its what i used. You need to become completely familiar with the Cisco IOS using this. Just google packet tracer you should be able to find a free download with little effort.

Once you feel comfortable with your knowledge schedule your test over at vue.com

After achieving your CCNA and having a year or two experience you should start looking for a better job as a network administrator. These typically pay somewhere on average around 60k in the us but vary wildly.

Good luck and if you have any questions hit me up!


**TLDR verision**

See if you qualify for a WIA grant 
http://www.ehow.com/how_4927098_apply-wia-grant.html

Get some sort of over the phone customer service job to get some experience and have a job while you study.

Study and obtain your Comptia A+ certification. 

Optional: Study and obtain your Comptia N+ cert

Get an entry level helpdesk job.

Study and obtain your Cisco CCNA.

???? (sorry couldnt help myself)

technology,I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for,"https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have &gt;500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.
