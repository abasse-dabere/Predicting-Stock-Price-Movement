Story:
Dailysteals.com is one of those deal-of-the-day websites.  I found a link, I think on here, to a set of 5.1 Logitech speakers for $40 (something like 70% off), score! Not so much.

I never received a shipping notice, so a week later I sent them an e-mail.  The following Monday they got back to me saying the package was delivered, but waiting at the local post-office, pinned the blame on UPS (probably accurate).  I live in a city though, we have many local post offices, and, despite inquiries, both DailySteals and UPS were useless in pointing me in the right direction.

On my second attempt, I found the correct post office to discover they had simply slapped a shipping label on the product box and some extra packing tape and sent it through.  The box was beat to all hell, but I took it home and opened it up.  All the serial numbers were blacked out, and the subwoofer was already blown.  You gotta be kidding me.

I sent them another email, and again, no response til the following Monday.  They gave me an RMA and offered I ship it back for a refund on my own dime.  Fuck that, I'm not paying more to send this back with the hopes that they might follow through and pay me back at some point.

I told them they could do better, and that as they only respond to customer complaints on Mondays, I'd wait a week.  That was a week and a half ago, with no response yet.  I think it's safe to say I won't be getting one.

So, end of the day, I don't expect to solve this problem, but would see to it that no one else gets screwed over by this company.

TLDR: Dailysteals.com provides shit product with shit customer service.

technology,Dear Reddit. Lets make SOPA/ProtectIP backfire. Make it a dawn of a new idea era. Here's how:,"Already, there's a lot of people opposing it. Great! But what's shocking is that well-intentioned attempts from [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/12/14/mozilla-leaders-to-dc-there-are-alternatives-to-sopa/) for example of a compromise.

Why the hell would making a compromise to a more authoritative bill stop the onslaught of the demands of internet control? If you haven't seen the onslaught, here: [PRO-IP, more penalties! 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRO-IP_Act), [Former ProtectIP Sept 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combating_Online_Infringement_and_Counterfeits_Act), [Illegal streaming May 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_S.978), Mysterious [global discussions on ACTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement) behind closed doors that magically makes it way to many countries' law: [Heard of three strikes?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_response).

So here's my proposal:

Cut back copyright terms to the lifetime of the artist. Creativity hasn't slowed. It's impracticable to police personal use with strict copyright legislation.

Create a public domains team to tackle abuses of claiming public domain as copyright.

Create a DMCA abuses team that fines and disbars legal agents/firms that abuse DMCA.

The kicker: $1 billion funding towards 3D printers companies, training, etc. This will allow people to switch from buying foreign products. As a result; saving costs to environment, wallet, and yet create more jobs. I'm sure your grandmother needs help printing that open source car. [More info on wtf 3D printing is](http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page) and the popular article [End Of Intellectual Property](http://reprap.org/wiki/EndOfIntellectualProperty).

The next frontier of censorship may just as well be 3D printers. I'm sure the manufacturing companies don't want it to exist (psst, ACTA). Drugs? Open source drugs could be made. Cars? Of course. Beds, toys, fishing rod, etc. It's the new era of copyright, the physical kind.

I'm Australian (check history, mate) and facing my current government's capitalist attempts to make free internet a premium. And SOPA will turn internet to a corporate medium for those with deep pockets not only in USA but in Australia.

Giving way to censorship? Not cool.

5:57pm MST: I'm blown away at the response about this. Great job! Here is another template revision by [nox_venator](http://reddit.com/user/nox_venator/): 

""Hello Google,

The idea, as brought forth on the website http://www.reddit.com, is that Google can make an even greater push for an open internet as the fight against SOPA mounts. I, [real_name], would hereby like to suggest that Google, Inc. displays a notice about the effects SOPA will have on the free flow of information on its homepage. Google is the homepage for millions of Americans and is visited by many millions more every single day. It is my impression that most Americans are unaware of the threat to the internet they know and love - by making a mention, Google can raise awareness about this devastating bill in a tremendous way. [1]

It isn't just American citizens that SOPA will effect as this SOPA bill as it currently stands will effectively filter, censor and take down any part of the internet that the SOPA-backers don't wish to see remain.

Google has in the past, pulled out of China for the very same reason [2]: that the government was blocking sites it deemed unsuitable for public viewing. Please display a similar level of visible action with regards to this simple idea.

SOPA works against the UN's report that Internet Access is a basic human right [3], so please consider this suggestion as we fight back against the suppression of every man, woman and child's right to free knowledge.

With hopeful expectation, [real_name]

You want action Reddit? You want people to talk? Contact the Media...*Call* and *Write* their
* phone lines
* emails

* social networks

Make it so every newsroom producer has NO choice but to make mention of the evil **Sopa** would bring. Flood their communication channels so bad, that the fact it's happening becomes the story! State your case in your message and give them something to work with. First and foremost news needs a story to be told. Assignment editors and News directors will send reporters to localize stories. 
(ex.WHY INTERNET ENTHUSIASTS EVERYWHERE WANT TO WASH CLEAN THE SOPA)

Here are just a few links to get started with- that WILL get noticed. Most anchors and reporters you see on tv do have facebook and twitter and they DO find and write stories themselves. Also, should anyone contact Alison Kosik or Robin Meade, tell them I personally would like to say I love you.

AND DO SEEK OUT YOUR LOCAL NEWS STATIONS AS WELL!


* EDIT
My tech savvy friend just informed me that he sadly knew nothing about SOPA and has been uninformed. However, he has assured me he had seen Lindsay Lohan's boobs. Preash to you sir!




*EDIT 2


I am by no means an authority on how a newsroom works.
I will say that I have NEVER once seen corporate influence in the journalist efforts in the pursuit of a story.
I cannot speak for the inner workings of The FOX News Network. 
I will say it is common for a Newsroom to have regulations and procedures on certain content that hits the air.
(Ex. Said newsroom may decide not to cover deadly shootings or dead bodies. Some may decide that crime stories take precedence over human interest and consumer fraud.)
 This all falls into the stations marketing strategy of how they want to appeal to their audience (often 25-54yr olds)

Bottom line, car commercials keep the lights on in your local TV station. Good journalism and interesting stories are going to keep you watching. If it's good enough it gets filtered up to the big boys.
 If you think for a minute that a some suit and tie executive could walk up to Brian Williams and tell him not to cover a story of importance because it doesn't align with their company's agenda than you are crazy.
  These journalists are of the highest caliber. Your local weatherman might have a cocaine addiction (cough cough... Charlotte) But when you play with the big boys you better know your shit. Stories with the most interest on a stations website will only fuel our need to do more with it. 
Headlines sell... Interest sells... We investigate fraud and corruption and seek out the truth but if it doesn't sell than Lindsay Lohan's boobs will. Keep pressing your media outlets. You would be so surprised how a bull-shit story in dumbfuck Okahoma can be a headline the next day.

We thought the SOPA hearing was postponed until 2012. Turns out that was a decoy, it's [back on Wednesday, December 21st, 2011](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111216/11102617108/sopa-markup-runs-out-time-likely-delayed-until-2012.shtml). They're trying to get this bill through committee before the end of the year. 

Here's what we need to do: **call our representatives before Wednesday, and tell them politely why we don't agree with the bill.**

This is a list of [all of the members](http://judiciary.house.gov/about/members.html) of the House Judiciary Committee, with links to their individual websites and contact information.

As Representative Lofgren pointed out in her [amazing AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nfhhy/member_of_house_judiciary_committee_ama_on_sopa/), your representatives may (and likely are) out of touch with online communication methods, and are more likely to be reached and moved by calls to their office.

Now, when you do call them, and this is important, please be **polite and kind.** The phones are being answered by overworked, underpaid young people, and nobody wants to talk to a combative or abusive caller. If you politely and coherently call and make your point, you have a much better chance of having your point heard.

Here is a list of all of the [sponsors of the bill](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ndyi5/lets_establish_a_list_right_now_whoever_votes_for/c38eaqi) as well. 

If you're represented by someone who has sponsored this, please call them and let them know why you oppose it. Please make your point coherently and politely. These people want to be elected again, make sure they know what their constituents think!

**Even if your representative doesn't currently support the bill or isn't a part of the House Judiciary Committee, it's still important to call them. They will most likely have to vote on it eventually, and knowing ahead of time what their constituents think will be extremely important when it comes to a vote.**

Shame on these companies.

EDIT: If the link I provide here is not accurate, I apologize to everyone and all of the companies who have received unjustified criticism because they are on a non-accurate list. If anyone has a more updated list PLEASE post it here. 

I think that more important than what the accurate list is, is for everyone reading this to take with them the idea of posting on Facebook Fan Page walls of companies--because yes, this is a sensitive area and I really truly believe that it will make a difference. I really hope that the entire list is not accurate and that all of these companies do not support SOPA. That is all.

&gt;[GoDaddy CEO] Adelman couldn’t commit to changing its position on the record in Congress when asked about that, but said “I’ll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that’s an important step.” But when pressed, he said “We’re going to step back and let others take leadership roles.” He felt that the public statement removing their support would be sufficient for now, though further steps would be considered.

So, GoDaddy hasn't gone on the record to *oppose* SOPA, and now they've made it clear they're still officially *supporting* it. In my opinion, the ""we no longer support SOPA"" statement released yesterday seems to be just a calculated PR move.

I'll still be moving all my domains.",1110,4132,2011-12-24,TECH,0.06363432109355927,0.8845306038856506,0.051835037767887115

technology,"While we are focusing on SOPA, we are being distracted from the Senate version of the bill: the PROTECT IP Act.","The [PROTECT IP Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act) was introduced in May. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, and was only stopped from going to a vote because Senator Ron Wyden put a hold on it. SOPA was introduced in October as an attempt to introduce the same ""anti-piracy"" legislation via the House. It has of course met with high profile opposition, so the supporters of this draconian legislation have turned their attention back to the PROTECT IP Act.

[Senator Harry Reid is seeking a cloture to override Senator Wyden's hold](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111217/22470217117/senator-harry-reid-moves-to-approve-protect-ip-begin-censoring-internet.shtml). **They will vote at 2:15pm on Tuesday, January 24, 2012.** The supporters already have 40 senators. They have a month in which to convince another 20 to vote yes. If this happens, the act will be sent to the House to vote on (there it only needs a majority).

That means we have a month in which to lobby Senators to oppose the bill. We're up against giant corporations, and I think it will require as many Redditors as possible to take part.  

**[Here is a list of those people/corporations supporting/opposing the PROTECT IP Act](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/money).** 

Remember, if the PROTECT IP Act is passed, SOPA won't even be needed any more.

Only update the ""administrative"" information and not the technical or other categories.  


""Hi James,
I apologize for the confusion. In some cases, ICANN does require you to update your contact information to keep it accurate in the WhoIs database. In all other cases, though, updating the registrant information is an optional service we offer. When you make the changes, you are required to check that you understand that this action will result in a 60 day lock on the domain names. Since it is an opt-in service, you have agreed that the lock will be lifted at the specified date.

We apologize for the inconvenience, but will be happy to help you with the process as soon as they are eligible for transfer.""",38,315,2011-12-24,TECH,0.041229743510484695,0.9338482022285461,0.024922050535678864

So I have actually been pretty active with this whole GoDaddy stuff and explaining the situation with moving your domains and all. There has been a lot of talk of 21K-71K names being lost in the last two days. I mentioned that I would ask a source who used to always provide these stats on his blog (Thank you, &lt;WAITING FOR APPROVAL&gt; of &lt;http://www. WAITING FOR APPROVAL .com). I used to be an active blogger but needed 2011 to take care of my own stuff. I still read MANY of the domaining blogs, but &lt; WAITING FOR CITATION APPROVAL &gt; used to always toss out the most interesting stats. Per the communities curiosity, I bugged him about getting some numbers crunched. This was his e-mail.

&gt;The total net gain/lose is the real number to look at in the time frame of the SOPA situation and those number are not currently available BUT godaddy has lost about 1 Million domains in a little over a month.. which is pretty shocking by itself.

Still waiting since the numbers need some time I think. As I mentioned before, 21,000 (even 100K) is not much in the domaining world. GoDaddy is a freakin' beast. These numbers would have been an insult. I am starting to think that the uproar has been VERY under estimated. 

Just wanted to do a quick update. I'm dead tired, but I thought everyone would be curious. People are trying to figure out everything. Online, you can't really hide stats. GoDaddy accounts for 30% of all domain registrations, and there are, on average, 27K .com domains registered PER DAY. (100million per year according to verisign--'owner' of .com/.net TLD http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/why-verisign/research-trends/domain-name-industry-brief/index.xhtml)

Most likely, SOPA/PIPA will not yet be law.  This is a huge opportunity -- and it doesn't require a lot of people.  In fact, a handful of buses (realizing it's a long drive) from SF would do it.

Do what, exactly?  Occupy Hollywood.  

Specifically:

* On January 24 (that's the day of the PIPA cloture vote), find a movie theater  -- again, ideally in the SF area -- and protest.  If done right, it'll be guaranteed to get tech press coverage, if not regional coverage as well.  It doesn't take a lot of people.  Three dozen gets it done.

* Every weekend until the Oscars, return to protest. 

* Ideally, line up protestors in other cities who are going to follow your lead.  Again, it's not going to take a lot of people -- 30 or so in NY, 30 or so here, 30 or so there.  

* Then, on February 25 -- a Saturday, the day before the Oscars -- Occupy the Kodak Theater.  Not the building itself (no need to get arrested) -- but everything public around it.  The news that day is going to be about Oscar prep, and there's really no way to avoid covering the protests if they're going on right then, right there.",22,86,2011-12-28,TECH,0.04548751935362816,0.9181187748908997,0.03639370948076248

technology,GoDaddy is violating ICANN's policies by denying domain transfers when whois is changed,"According to [ICANN's registrar advisory on April 2008](http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/advisory-03apr08.htm):

&gt;  A registrant change to Whois information is not a valid basis for denying a transfer request.

GoDaddy has their own internal policy where if you change anything in your domain's whois, except for the email address, they put a hold on that domain for 60 days and won't allow you to transfer it. They say they do this for security purposes however this makes no sense because most fraud from a domain happens from some one changing the domain's email address. Obviously they are doing this just to hold onto domains for as long as possible.

I called GoDaddy about this and they won't release the lock. They told me that I agreed to it when I changed the contact information. I went back to double check and see if I clicked a checkbox without knowing it and there was no checkbox. Even if there was a checkbox, that is still against ICANN's rules. You can't force some one to agree to their policy in order to change whois:

&gt; Registrars that have implemented processes that require registrants to consent to deny transfer requests in order to update Whois contact information are not obtaining voluntary express objections and therefore such objections cannot be used as a basis for denying a transfer pursuant to Section A.3 of the Transfer Policy.

GoDaddy either needs to change their policy or ICANN needs to remove them as an accredited registrar. I have submitted a complaint to ICANN however I haven't heard anything back yet. If you have had this same problem, please [submit a complaint to ICANN](http://reports.internic.net/cgi/registrars/problem-report.cgi). They need to take action on this issue.

**About the Boycott**

Today, December 29th is the official [Reddit Move Your Domain Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nohs8/godaddy_mass_migration_day_still_on_for_december/), as proposed in the [original thread that started this boycott](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/). You'll be joining good company such as [Wikipedia](https://twitter.com/#!/jimmy_wales/status/150287579642740736), [Ashton Kutcher](http://twitter.com/#!/aplusk/status/150260823405760514), [IMGUR](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ntp70/imgur_to_boycott_godaddy_over_sopa_support/), and possibly [Cheezburger](http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/cheezburgers-ben-huh-if-godaddy-supports-sopa-were-taking-our-1000-domains-elsewhere/)

By transferring your domain, you basically agree to renew your domain for 1 year with your new registrar once your renewal date comes up, so that is what you are paying. For example, say I renewed my domain with GoDaddy in July 2011. I transfer it today to NameSilo for ~$5. Once July 2012 rolls around, I automatically get a 1 year renewal that I paid for today, so I'm good until July 2013.

You can't transfer your domain if you registered it in the last 60 days, but be sure to mark it on your calendar so you do it once that happens. Also, if you renewed it in the last 45 days, don't transfer it until the 45 days have passed, as you you might lose the year you just paid for.

**Why you should take your business away from GoDaddy:**

[GoDaddy supports SOPA](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/), filed a 
[statement with the House in support of SOPA](http://www.thedomains.com/2011/11/15/here-is-godaddys-statement-in-support-of-the-stop-online-privacy-act-house-hearing-tomorrow/), was [""unimpressed"" by the early moments of the Reddit boycott](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nntxp/godaddys_response_to_the_boycott_go_daddy_has/), insincerely [flip-flopped hard in an obvious PR move the very next day](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/no6pr/victory_boycott_forces_godaddy_to_drop_its/), tried to [erase evidence of its previous stance by deleting their earlier blog post](http://nwlinux.com/godaddys-official-position-on-sopa/).
