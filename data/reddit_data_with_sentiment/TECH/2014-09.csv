technology,"After a 45 hour weekend night shift, I was fired from Comcast with no warning and no phone call.","Prelude and note: I signed no NDA's, no trade-secret contracts, etc. I worked as a contractor some time ago, and was not actually employed as a W-2 Comcast Employee. I just figured today was finally the day to tell my story.

So, a little background. I'm an IT contractor, working for an anonymous company in some sector of the US, located between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Real Specific.  
Some months ago, I was approached by the contract agency for a job. If you've ever worked in IT for any length of time, you know these recruiters will say anything to get you on the phone. However, having recently been trashed by my current employer over nothing, and not making anything close to market wages for the work I was doing, I decided to talk to one. They had a position as a Server Engineer / Systems Administrator opening up, and wanted me to move into it. It was a short-term, back-fill contract to replace an employee who was bought out of his previous contract. It would be a technical raise (I would be leading deployments, installs, etc), and a financial raise (Not a significant annual amount, but almost 30% more than I was currently making). The catch is, it was with Comcast.  
Now, I'm very well versed in IT. I've been working with computers since I could walk and talk, servers and networking since elementary school (I kid you not), and I have a Bachelors of Science in Information Engineering Technology. I'm well aware of what the FCC Chairman is trying to do, and I'm more than a little aware of the Comcast Oligopoly in my area (my choices for internet in my area are currently 12Mbps DSL for $60/mo, or 80Mbps Comcast for $70/mo. Gee, what should I pick). However, I figured I'd give it a shot, because I'm not the kind of person to write off a job and a raise without at least giving it some thought.  
My interviews with Comcast went fantastically. They had a contract written up before I could blink. For the next 5 weeks, I busted arse to do anything and everything they needed. I took the night shift at a National Data Center while a co-worker had family concerns. I offered ideas on how to help others with productivity. I completed 30-server installs days ahead of schedule. Twice in two nights, I prevented what would've been regional and national service-affecting downtime events (one taking down a large chunk of NBC, and the other affecting corporate/customer data). My manager was thrilled to have me around, even going so far as to contact my contracting agency and thank them for my work, and I started helping out on a massive 800+ server expansion.  
Now, at one point some time into my contract, a few weeks before it ran out, I was approached by my manager and Comcast HR. My performance as a contractor was exemplary. They were considering buying me out of my contract. At one point, I was given an interview for a W-2 full-time position. After the interview, a co-worker offered me some book by the current CEO (I forget the title), that detailed the company's values, and how he was the best person on Wall Street to work for. I politely declined the book, as I didn't agree with some of the net neutrality arguments, the Comcast-TWC merger, and a few other things (note: I mentioned none of this. I simply declined the book, and the co-worker joked about it, ""what, you don't want the brainwashing material every employee gets a copy of?"").
Then, out of nowhere, on Monday morning after my 4th night that weekend (Thursday-Sunday night), one of the Comcast higher-ups on the east coast contacted my contract company, and made it very clear, in no uncertain terms, that my contract was terminated, and that it was not open to any further discussion. I was not asked about anything that would get you fired (illegal activity, torrents, porn, etc. None of which, of course, I did at work). In fact, nobody from Comcast contacted me, in any way, whatsoever, but they did make it clear they wanted no further contact with me. I was to return my company laptop and phone to the contract company I worked for, and they would return it to Comcast on my behalf. They refused any phone calls from me or my contract manager, and when HR of my company called Comcast HR, they refused to discuss any details, saying only that my ""Contract was terminated, and the nature of it is sensitive, so there will be no discussion on the matter"".  
Now, after this, I took another contract, as the contracting company heard nothing but good things about me until Comcast terminated my contract. I currently have another job, with an unrelated company. I'm not thrilled with how Comcast handled this issue (okay, no sugar-coating it. The situation sucked and I was pretty massively depressed for awhile, because I had no idea what I did, and started blaming myself), but they technically did nothing illegal. I was a contractor, and could be released from my contract by them at any time, for any reason. Comcast does this a lot; most of their company positions not in Philadelphia are contract or contract-to-hire positions. Even their internal I.T. and Server/Systems help desk is outsourced to India.

**TL;DR:** I was a contractor for Comcast (as is a large chunk of their workforce), and they fired me without discussing it, for no reason they would admit to.",1083,3138,2014-09-10,TECH,0.48943833634257317,0.492013793438673,0.0185479074716568

technology,The Tea Party Is Trying To Kill Net Neutrality,"Tea Party: Owned By Big Telecom 

Koch Bros Are Back With More Net Neutrality Opposition 

http://stopthecap.com/2010/05/11/americans-for-prosperity-backed-by-big-telecom-is-back-with-more-net-neutrality-opposition/ 

Americans for Prosperity, the group that harassed residents of Salisbury, North Carolina last year with push polls and recorded phone messages opposing municipal broadband, is renewing its effort to sign up the tea party crowd to oppose Net Neutrality reforms. 

Ostensibly representing those favoring “less government,” AFP is actually ﻿﻿a corporate front group founded by oil billionaire David Koch but also backed by telecom interests. The group shills for large phone and cable companies to keep them deregulated, and opposes consumer reforms. The group’s spokesman on Net Neutrality is Phil Kerpen — a regular on Fox News — appearing on Glenn Beck’s program to nod in agreement to wild claims that Net Neutrality is Maoist. 

Now the group has unveiled a new advertisement opposing Net Neutrality and is spending $1.4 million dollars in its first ad buy. The 30-second ad targets legislators with wild claims about Net Neutrality that don’t pass even the most rudimentary truth tests. 

Comparing Net Neutrality with Washington-directed bailouts of banks and the auto industry, the group claims Washington wants to “spend billions to take over the Internet.” Apparently the Internet is available for purchase on eBay. 

In reality, the only group with the deep pockets is this debate is America’s telecommunications companies, who are among the biggest spenders for lobbyists, astroturf campaigns that claim to represent consumer interests, and writing big campaign contribution checks to state and federal elected legislators. 

Establishing Net Neutrality protections doesn’t cost billions. Fighting against establishing Net Neutrality might. 

In fact, the biggest expense the Federal Communications Commission faces in its efforts to adopt Net Neutrality reforms will come from legal expenses brought about by continuous provider lawsuits.",286,1274,2014-09-14,TECH,0.0483526736497879,0.9126971960067749,0.03895010054111481

technology,"Time Warner is already terrible, despite a looming Comcast buyout. I received a mailing from them about upgrading my service to have TV included and to receive a free laptop/PC for a little less than I was already paying. I figured I would record the interaction- just in case. I'm glad I did.","**UPDATE: There appears to be a problem with the update thread. Here is the direct link to the youtube video showing the result-** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P9WIfGyX-Q&amp;feature=youtu.be

UPDATE: You can find the update here- http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2gixp7/updatetime_warner_is_already_terrible_despite_a/

Having seen many terrible recordings with Comcast I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to record my own interaction to have a backup of what I was being told. 

I was transferred something like eight or nine times, sent to the business class department voicemail for some reason, told to stop recording by a supervisor (who had no answers and told me some...ridiculous things) told opposing things by different reps, and ultimately had a rep admit the letter I was sent was a lie. 

Here is a copy of the letter they sent me- http://imgur.com/6Uttmkq

They ultimately told me to call back to the customer help desk tomorrow, right after the last person tells me the letter is wrong. If anyone ends up caring I will post an update.

Here is the interaction if you would like to see it- Time Warner and Their Crap: http://youtu.be/Xg3IhBraxLM

TL;DR: Time Warner lied in their promotional mailing. A representative admits that to me after being transferred to nine different people who don't know what the hell they are talking about, one being a supervisor who gets a little feisty about being recorded.

EDIT 2: The timeline of the video for those interested in skipping about-

01:26- Terrence gets on the phone and confirms the package for me. Has to transfer me because it lowers my bill.

02:30- PKE boredom.

02:40- The words come out of Terrence's mouth.

03:24- Transferred to Tiara. She denies what Terrence said.

06:22- Tiara wants to confirm with a supervisor.

07:23- I ask to be transferred to a supervisor. Mr. Feisty cometh. He gets mad that I am recording.

11:50- Mr. Feisty transfers me again.

11:55- Cynthia picks up.

12:53- My phone runs out of space and I start recording on my desktop.

16:51- Transferred to someone who does not identify themselves.

20:27- Nameless says she will transfer me to a 'specialist'.

20:33- I find out that I am being transferred to the business class line for some reason. It directs me to a voicemail which tells me to leave a message after the tone. There is no tone.

21:08- I put a shirt on and call back.

21:13- Emily picks up. I explain how I've been bounced around and, essentially, hung up on. 

23:39- Emily tells me that I don't have to worry about anyone misspeaking or anything because they too are recording all calls. 

25:04- I try to tell Emily that the letter says it is to add TV to my internet service, not about starting new service. She understands. So she says.

25:30- She refers to the fine print possibly saying that it is for new service. Here is a picture of the fine print- http://i.imgur.com/f2Xnm30.jpg

26:10- Transferred to Ricardo, who asks me for an EID number. Tells me I was accidentally transferred to an 'internal department'.

30:47- Ricardo informs me he is going to transfer me again, but with the catch that he is going to explain it to them that I do qualify for the package on the flyer.

31:28- Ricardo comes back to tell me that I actually don't qualify for the package on the flyer.

32:43- I confirm with Ricardo that the letter I was sent was not correct. He says that is true.

33:05- I repeat myself and have him confirm what he just said.

35:10- Ricardo tells me to call back to customer care on monday/tomorrow.

35:59- Ricardo is saying goodbye, and starts laughing for some reason. My final thoughts follow after.",1930,4479,2014-09-15,TECH,0.06709246337413788,0.9090837240219116,0.023823870345950127

I ended up talking to a woman named Melissa who was very nice and sincerely tried to help with my problem. She said she agreed that I should be eligible for the offer based on the fine print and checked to make sure I was. Her supervisor agreed but said that feedback on the offer had been shaky and that I would still likely be declined. Melissa agreed that this was wrong and put a request in to have an exception made for me. I have included only the ending to that conversation which basically sums up the first part of the conversation. I only included this part to keep the video much shorter.

The majority of the video is the conversation I had with a Time Warner rep that actually called me in the middle of my conversation with Melissa. It's pretty straightforward.

Here it is- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P9WIfGyX-Q&amp;feature=youtu.be

TL;DR: Yes, I got what I wanted, BUT AT WHAT COST? No, but seriously, I don't know if I agree with calling this an exception when I think it should have just been an acceptance of an offer that I should qualify for. I tell her it would be a good idea to get this whole situation over to marketing to have their ads changed. I admit in the video that it may be a futile suggestion, but she says they've already forwarded the suggestion.

technology,"I got the attention of Comcast's executives by filing a complaint with the FCC. All of our issues are resolved, and we got serious discounts for their poor service.","Just an FYI to anyone having issues with Comcast.

[Here is a breakdown of part of my experience trying to get service from Comcast](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2e7iqf/so_im_in_the_middle_of_a_terrible_experience_with/)

TLDR version:

- Told we were able to self-install: not true
- 5 appointments set up, 4 total no-shows
- I was called a liar, shuffled, hung-up on, lied to
- Spoke to several ""supervisors"", promised techs would show up, given discounts and free services, no actual help
- Couldn't get any help, started tweeting and facebooking in hopes that public shaming would force their hand
- 7 days of awful headache dealing with them before we could be connected

So I filed a complaint with the FCC. Got a call a couple days later from someone in Comcast Executive Service. We now have the following discounts:

- $20 for each missed appointment ($80 total)
- $25 one-time loyalty discount
- $15 off every month for a year
- $60 one-time discount, I guess just for our trouble
- Free Cinemax
- Free installation

You can file a complaint with the FCC if you're having issues with your provider, but when I got a call from the executive lady, she specifically said that they were calling because I filed a complaint with the FCC.

So if anyone is looking for a way to get Comcast's attention, apparently this works.

technology,"Reddit, if we truly want to combat the practices of a company like Comcast, I propose the following...","I've contemplated posting this with some time and I've tried to keep it as brief as possible. The TL;DR is this, by rallying together as a large group of informed customers, we can negotiate and demand a better service.


**The Problem**
If you've ever tried to negotiate with a company to demand cheaper service, I'm willing to bet your efforts were almost entirely in vain. I've tried. And failed.


This is primarily because we, as *individual consumers*, constitute a minuscule proportion of a company's overall revenues and have little impact on what level of service we can demand from them.


Of course, each company is entirely aware of this - they understand their customer base is entirely decentralized and has no negotiation power.


**The Solution**
The solution isn't a major revolution but it is simple; an organized community where collusion and information is disseminated amongst all users. Trade unions have been doing this for years, where their members work together to achieve a common goal.


The situation is no different in dealing with companies.


If I, as a consumer, stop buying widgets from Company A then it is quite unlikely Company A will care all that much. However, if one thousand customers stop buying widgets from Company A then it is much more likely to take notice - and better yet, take action.


Here's a hypothetical scenario. We organize, right here on reddit, a substantial group of several thousand customers, from across the United States, that are unhappy with a particular type of service. Utilizing these large numbers, we can enable a bargaining process with different service providers to achieve a favorable outcome; notably, lower prices and better customer service.


**The first target. Internet Service Providers.**


If you do a quick search on reddit for ""Comcast"" you'll see an overwhelming amount of responses that fail to paint the company in a positive light:

There was, at least, some humor to be found in this thread title from user [/u/Zack_Fair_](http://www.reddit.com/user/Zack_Fair_)
&gt; [How long could Bruce Banner deal with Comcast before becoming The Hulk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/27prjd/how_long_could_bruce_banner_deal_with_comcast/)


It is inherently obvious that Comcast has a complete disregard for providing a quality level of service with some customers left with no other option but to bring, what should be, trivial issues into the public domain, to force an acceptable response from Comcast.


Of course, this issue isn't solely a characteristic of this company alone.


The real problem is that Comcast can afford to weather some bad PR, given their large market share. One customer isn't going to make a difference to them. Ultimately, you and I, the customers, are left with few options to negotiate with the behemoth.


In light of all the negativity, customers have started to take action... Just take a look at the [/r/WarOnComcast](http://reddit.com/r/waroncomcast) subreddit. While individual action is to be commended and lauded, the power of collective bargaining can be used as a strong tool to demand better service and better prices from the company or their competitors.


Losing 50,000 customers is bad. Losing 50,000 customers to a rival company is worse.


**The Next Step**


This first stage is to gauge reaction and promote discussion on the topic. So reddit, what are your thoughts? Is this something we can work together to achieve?

Edit: Wow, I did not expect my first ever Reddit post to hit the front page! It's amazing how passionate people are about their phones. Quick disclaimer - the specs above were copy/pasted directly from Wikipedia. If you disagree with them please feel free to update the respective wiki pages. I'm not going to change the stats here because, well I don't care. I also want to clarify that I'm not saying the Galaxy S3 is better than the iPhone 6; it isn't. I'm just pointing out the fact that the weight, screen size, CPU, RAM, battery and other specs of these two phones are indisputably similar. This is interesting, especially considering Apple recently sued Samsung for a billion dollars for copyright infringement! That being said, of course there is more to the story than just specs alone! But you can't just say the specs are completely meaningless. If they were, why would any company bother talking about them?
