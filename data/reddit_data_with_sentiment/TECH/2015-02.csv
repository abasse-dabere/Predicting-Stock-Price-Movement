gadgets,Does Sony intentionally make its phones to malfunction after a while?,"My first smartphone was an Ericsson P800 over a decade ago. Since then I've had about 10 different Ericsson, SonyEricsson and now Sony (Z2) phones. 

ALL of them have had the same problem -- when the phone has been in use for a while, its software starts to malfunction. For me it usually happened somewhere between 700-900 text messages (~8months of use). The early P800/P900/P990 phones became slower and slower and eventually you couldn't use them. In the latest Android phones (like the Z2) first the wireless connection starts to drop, then mobile connection and to fix it, you have to reboot it all the time.

The only fix for this is to reset the phone to the factory settings.

In the beginning I thought it was just a buffer overflow from bad coding but since the problem has been passing on from a phone generation to the next one, and from an OS to another, I simply can't believe it would be an accidental bug.

Any thoughts or similar experiences?",643,828,2015-02-15,TECH,0.21760912239551544,0.7582477927207947,0.024143138900399208

technology,"The biggest takeaway from 'Superfish': We need to push for ""No OS"" buying option.","**The Problem.**

I hope we can all agree that *bloatware is a problem*; it saps our performance, takes up our storage space, drains our batteries, and can (intentionally or not) create massive security holes and attack vectors that destroy our ability to protect our privacy and identities. 

More often than not, the laptop you buy from HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, etc., will be riddled with bloatware that is neither useful nor a necessary enhancement to your base OS of choice. Buyers in the know are forced to clean up the mess that's left for them on their brand new machine, and casual computer users are barraged with a cluttered, confusing UI/UX nightmare of slow, ugly, buggy, and insecure garbage.

We don't want your service centers, smart docks, targeted advertising, proprietary photo albums, command bars, anti-virus bundles, or any of your other 'enhancements'. I think it's safe to say that we're paying (often $1000+ USD) for some hardware and we want our OS of choice on top of it, nothing more.

**The Solution.**

*We need to demand an option to buy laptops and other machines with no pre-installed OS*. 

As the market for traditional desktops and laptops shrinks, the core audience of PC consumers have to stand up and demand better service from OEMs. The only reason this option doesn't exist for most OEMs right now is simple: *these companies care more about maximizing their profit margins by striking deals with other companies than providing a good service and computing experience to their users.*

Frankly, that's no longer acceptable. One could argue that, if the out-of-box laptop experience wasn't unarguably hurt by bloatware it would be a ""no harm, no foul"" situation. But Lenovo's recent Superfish disaster is just a prime example of the extent to which bloatware and these kinds of corporate deals can not only ruin the buyer's experience, but destroy their privacy, their business, and expose them to identity theft. 

As the market for pre-built PCs and laptops continues to fizzle out, it's the most loyal costumers who are left handing these companies thousands of dollars for increasingly worse experiences. And I'm afraid that, as the market shrinks, so will the per-unit profit margins - how will the OEMs recover these losses? Of course, by signing more deals with bloatware/adware/bundle companies. The bloatware problem will only get worse, unless we demand other options.

We simply can't trust ""Dellindows"" or ""Windows+Lenovo's Greatest Hits"" anymore, even after we've seemingly uninstalled all the bloatware we're aware of. I think we should demand the ability to buy blank-slate, No OS laptops and desktops from all vendors so that we can have the product we paid for with our own fresh and secure install of Windows, Linux, BSD, Hackintosh OSX, etc.

This is no longer a matter of 'freedom of choice' for users of different OSes, this is a user experience problem and a ~~potential~~ existing security nightmare. 

Any good reasons why this shouldn't be an option?

Edit: People saying that I need to start building my own PC are totally missing something. I've been building my own desktops from parts for 10+ years, but that's simply not realistic with laptops and bulk purchases. Those telling me to use OSX are also missing the point entirely .",1955,4711,2015-02-20,TECH,0.173691526055336,0.7982873916625977,0.02802111953496933

technology,TIL You can switch to Google's DNS and greatly increase home internet speeds,"I'm an AT&amp;T U-Verse customer.  In my area (Atlanta), I've noticed that my internet speed has been creeping down.  I ran a speed test (several times, actually), and always had exactly the speeds I was paying for.  So why does my internet seem so slow?

Finally I realized the hiccup seems to be happening whenever I start to load a new site.  Aha!  I know enough about the internet to identify this as a DNS issue.  I had heard Google offered a free DNS service, and so they do.  I switched to it (see below) and voila!  I estimate my actual wait times for a site to load, including Reddit, to have been cut by 2/3rds.  It was an immediate and noticeable effect, likely due to a ""party line effect"" of too many U-Verse users on one DNS server.

To use Google's free DNS, go to your network settings page, click the connection you are currently using (for most this will be wi-fi) and search for the Advanced or DNS tab.  (On a Mac that's within the Advanced sub-menu).  Add the following DNS links: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.  Those are Google's.  That's it.  Push apply, immediately enjoy increased speeds.

I'm sure Google and the NSA and three or four foreign governments track this or whatever, but I'm also confident the same thing happens with AT&amp;T or Comcast.  Only Google has shown a commitment to a faster internet, because it's in their business interest.  We can't all have Google Fiber but we might as well benefit from their free DNS service.",253,571,2015-02-21,TECH,0.0333949513733387,0.9159541726112366,0.05065083131194115

Years ago now, a few of us here met on /r/darknetplan while the crypto space was booming and them persistant threats were looming. This period encouraged us to take charge and focus our efforts to create the first easy to use cjdns client.  We believe in the end these technologies may liberate our current networks from their petty centralizations.  Our efforts have always been towards simple secure communications, easy enough for your grandma to use and yet strong enough to thwart a well funded enemy.

Our day is here and we are growing, fast!!!  We currently have over 500 clients on our private cjdns network, we are not currently intigrated with hyperboria, though that is on the roadmap. The Enigmabox software suite - based on the OpenWrt build system - is producing working builds for many SBCs that we have tested (order of performance: APU, BananaPi, ALIX, rpi1,rpi2) and work flawlessly. The web dashboard is smooth and responsive and a built-in update manager allows easy 1-click OpenWrt/cjdns upgrades.

We are currently looking for hackers, developers, testers, and activists with an interest in meshnetworking or privacy to test the suite as well as dig up bugs for us.  We want information that will make this product easier and better for the mainstream user.

*dawg, I heard you like VPNs...VPNs in your VPN!* : If your interested in testing the network or playing with some of our images - Enigmagroup will provide a 30day free trial of the internal VirtualISP service. A VISP lets you exit the cjdns-'darknet' to the iCANNternet, currently Enigma is the only service offering VISP services but we soon hope to have other competing VPN services available on the network.

technology,Hey guys do you remember that FCC vote that's happening in a few days that we all care about? Well Mignon Clyburn is trying to change the proposal at the last minute...,"This was submitted earlier by another user but no one is up voting it so I decided to just post the entire article here 

&gt;Democrat on the Federal Communications Commission wants to narrow the scope of new net neutrality rules that are set for a vote on Thursday, The Hill has learned.
Mignon Clyburn, one of three Democrats on the FCC, has asked Chairman Tom Wheeler to roll back some of the restrictions before the full commission votes on them, FCC officials said.
The request — which Wheeler has yet to respond to — puts the chairman in the awkward position of having to either roll back his proposals, or defend the tough rules and convince Clyburn to back down.
It’s an ironic spot for Wheeler, who for months was considered to be favoring weaker rules than those pushed for by his fellow Democrats, before he reversed himself about backing tougher restrictions on Internet service providers.
Wheeler will need the votes of both Clyburn and Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel to pass the rules since the two Republicans on the commission are expected to vote against anything he proposes.  
Clyburn’s changes would leave in place the central and most controversial component of Wheeler’s rules — the notion that broadband Internet service should be reclassified so that it can be treated as a “telecommunications” service under Title II of the Communications Act, similar to utilities like phone lines.
Proponents of net neutrality have said that move is the surest way to prevent Internet service providers from interfering with people’s access to the Web.
However, she wants to eliminate a new legal category of “broadband subscriber access services,” which was created as an additional point of legal authority for the FCC to monitor the ways that companies hand off traffic on the back end of the Internet.
Those deals, known as “interconnection” arrangements, became a point of contention last year, when Netflix accused Comcast and other companies of erecting “Internet tolls” before easily passing Web traffic from one network to another.
The initial plan sought by Wheeler would allow the FCC to investigate and take action against deals that are “not just and reasonable,” according to a fact sheet released by the FCC earlier this month.
Eliminating the new legal category could make it trickier for the FCC to police those arrangements, said the FCC officials, who were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the ongoing negotiations. 
Other FCC officials have previously said that the broader act of reclassifying broadband Internet service would, in and of itself, give the commission enough powers to oversee interconnection deals. That opinion has been backed up by lawyers at Google, among others, who made the argument to FCC officials last week.
Clyburn’s changes also would replace a new standard for Internet service providers’ conduct, which was meant to act as a catchall rule for any future behavior that might abuse consumers. That standard would be swapped out with potentially narrower language from 2010 rules that prevented “unreasonable discrimination.” A federal court tossed out those 2010 rules early last year, setting the stage for the FCC to write new rules. 
The full text of the rules will not be revealed to the public until after the FCC’s vote on Thursday morning.
Clyburn declined to discuss specific changes she was supporting on Tuesday.
“This is a process that is an interaction with all five members of the commission and their offices,” she said after remarks at a policy forum hosted by Comptel, a trade group.
“I will just say that I am attempting to strike a balance and whatever you hear, whether it’s accurate or not, is a reflection of my enthusiastic willingness to do so.”
In a speech at the Federal Communications Bar Association last week, the commissioner said that she was “pleased” with the initial draft but also hinted that she might need some fixes to strike that balance between “strong” protections for consumers and “clarity” for investors.
“Some have expressed concerns about allowing private rights of action in court, failing to consider the impact on smaller [Internet service providers], that including interconnection goes too far or that the case-by-case approach does not go far enough and that the new conduct rule may not be as strong as the previous unreasonable discrimination rule,” she said.
The requested changes come as FCC lawyers are spending hours poring over the text of the rules.
In keeping with FCC procedural rules, the four other commissioners outside of Wheeler’s office got their first look at the rules just two and a half weeks ago. Now they are scrambling to make edits ahead of the vote on Thursday morning.

I thought ""well that's a coincidence, what if my phone is listening to me speak."" I then remembered that less than 24 hours prior, I had granted Instagram access to my microphone, something I usually have disabled through privacy settings. 

 I also remembered that I was using Instagram when I had mentioned the club. I went back into my phones privacy settings and immediately disabled Instagram's access to the mic.

So I drew up a test to test my theory- Does Instagram actually listen to my conversation just while scrolling through photos?


 I would turn on the mic, mentioning a list of random words that I had wrote down....  Bulldozer, cucumbers, the louvre, Maserati, hiking in the Yukon, African Safari vacation, and a few other random words/terms that had nothing to do with my Facebook interests. 


 Sure enough, two hours later I was getting ads for Gold Coast Maserati, and African Vacations, also ads for art museums, and climbing.

technology,Megathread: Net Neutrality passes; the FCC has voted 3-2 to regulate the internet as a utility.,"###A brief summary:

The Federal Communications Commission has decided to **apply the same rules that govern the telephone service to broadband internet**, in an attempt to ensure the fair and equal treatment of all traffic on the Internet, with three commissioners voting in favour and two against.

This reclassification of fixed and mobile broadband as a telecommunications service means that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will be regulated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. 

The US Telecommunications Industry Association said that broadband providers would take ""immediate"" legal action over the rule changes.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said:

&gt; This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept: openness, expression and an absence of gatekeepers telling them what they can do, where they can go and what they can think.”

***

###What does this mean?

The main changes for broadband providers, as summarised by the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31638528), are as follows:

* Broadband access is being reclassified as a telecommunications service and utility, like electricity and water, meaning it will be subject to much heavier regulation

* Broadband providers cannot block or speed up connections for a fee - all data should be treated equally

* Internet providers cannot strike deals with content firms, known as paid prioritisation, for smoother delivery of traffic to consumers

* Interconnection deals, where content companies pay broadband providers to connect to their networks, will also be regulated

* Firms which feel that unjust fees have been levied can complain to the FCC. Each one will be dealt with on a case by case basi

All of the rules will also apply to mobile providers as well as fixed line providers.

Under the new rules, the FCC will have a variety of new powers, including:

* They will be able to enforce consumer privacy rules

* They will be able to extract money from Internet providers to help subsidize services for rural Americans, educators and the poor

* They will be able to ensure services such as Google Fiber are able to build new broadband pipes faster and at less cost.

Regulations have been relaxed somewhat, allowing local Internet providers to compete with the more established ISPs
