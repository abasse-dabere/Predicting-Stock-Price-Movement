technology,The problem I predict with self driving cabs and cars,"What I believe will be a major challenge for the success of self driving cabs and cars will be figuring how to deal with the negative aspects of society. The problem with self driving cabs will be with the dirtbags of society. They will vandalize them, urinate and take dumps in them, trash them, cause filth and lingering body odor, get sick and barf in them, steal parts off them, and so forth. Because of this people will avoid them. A person will get into a self driving cab and find themselves sitting in someone's vomit and urine. Word will quickly spread.

The problem with all self driving cars is that they will always, under any and all circumstances, be highly defensive and passive in their driving style. People will pull out in front of them, not let them merge, steal parking spots, walk out in front of them, etc, because they know that the self driving car will be very passive and defensive. 

Criminals will quickly figure out how to ambush self driving cars. They will have kids run out and stand still in the front and back of a self driving car. The self driving car will be trapped as the passengers are robbed, raped, abducted, and/or the car itself is pilfered or stolen. 

How to program a self driving car to deal with scumbags will become a significant challenge.",73.0,9,2015-07-16,TECH,0.09287473559379578,0.8812801837921143,0.025845054537057877

Microsoft owns Pando Networks, famous for the malware/botnet Pando Media Booster.

Windows Update in Windows 10 utilizes P2P by default, most likely the same P2P technology used by Pando Media Booster. Essentially it turns your PC into a zombie host server, wasting your bandwidth serving updates to other computers. This also means Windows Update might be utilized later to spread malware through the P2P system via 0days.

You cannot turn off ""Telemetry"" unless you own Windows 10 Enterprise Edition.

This means your computer will continuously leak unspecified information to Microsoft and there's no way of turning this off.

You cannot turn off ""Real-time Protection"", aka Windows Defender. Even if you do it will turn itself on again after a while.

This means you cannot prevent your PC from sending random files and information to Microsoft for ""analysis"". https://archive.is/Dln44

Cortana has zero local storage functionality and does not function unless you have a Microsoft Account connected.

It will even inform you about this if you try using it on a local account, and then shut itself down.

Windows 10 start menu will have ""Content suggestions"" which are on by default, which means you'll be seeing ads.
