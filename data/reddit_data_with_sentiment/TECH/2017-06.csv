technology,"reddit, let’s get organized. More than 30 subreddits have announced they’re joining the Internet-wide day of action to save net neutrality on July 12th","Hey Reddit,
 
As you may have already heard, [on July 12th](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) major websites and Internet users are coming together for an Internet-Wide day of action to defend net neutrality (in the tradition of the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown.) More than 30 subreddits have already announced that they will join the effort, including /r/Music, /r/EarthPorn, /r/Futurology, /r/listentothis, /r/Creepy, /r/pcmasterrace, and /r/youtube. Many subreddits have stickied posts to announce their participation and help spread the word.
 
Right now, the FCC is planning to dismantle Title II net neutrality protections that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T from controlling what Internet users can see by throttling, blocking, and censoring sites and apps, or charging special fees that get passed along to consumers. Big Cable companies are pouring a ton of money into lobbying, misleading ads, and astroturf campaigns in an attempt to confuse the public. If they succeed, the Internet will never be the same.
 
**Let’s have a conversation about how we as redditors can organize together for July 12th to make sure that decision-makers in Washington, DC listen to real Internet users, not just telecom lobbyists. There are many ways reddit, and redditors can get involved** 
 
Reddit itself has agreed to participate in the day of action along with popular sites like [Amazon, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, GitHub, and Mozilla.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/06/net-neutrality-amazon-etsy-kickstarter-protest) This is going to be big.
 
There’s so much we can do together, from flooding the FCC and Congress with comments and phone calls to organizing in-person redditor meetings with our lawmakers. Learn more about the day of action at [Battle for the Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) and let’s discuss in the comments.
 
Below is a full list of subreddits joining the Internet-wide day of action on July 12th. If you’re a mod or want to encourage the mods of a subreddit you’re active in to join, contact [/u/JPTIII](https://www.reddit.com/u/JPTIII) or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org

technology,"PornHub, OK Cupid, Imgur, DuckDuckGo, Namecheap, Bittorrent, and a bunch of other big sites have joined the Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality on July 12 (Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, and Reddit were already on board.)","Hey reddit, I wanted to give a quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** that lots of us are planning for July 12th.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them.

technology,"Net neutrality day of action update: Twitter, Soundcloud, and Medium, have joined. Reddit, This could be as big as SOPA.","Hey reddit, I wanted to give another quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** planned for July 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and Internet users are helping organize.

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.",1152,44658,2017-06-22,TECH,0.03145963419228792,0.9262105226516724,0.04232985898852348

We’re now just a little more than two weeks out from the big **[Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality planned for July 12th.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

This thing has gained a ton of momentum, and we’ve already got a bunch of the most popular sites on the Internet on board including Twitter, Amazon, Etsy, Kickstarter, Netflix, Mozilla, Pornhub, Private Internet Access, Github, OK Cupid, Soundcloud, and Imgur. Plus, Reddit itself and more than 100 subreddits!

We’ve taken in a ton of the ideas that people have voiced in previous reddit threads and through email and [have unveiled](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12#join) several examples of the types of messages that sites, forums, apps, and services can display on July 12. Companies and Internet users are going to take action by putting a prominent message in their sites and social media accounts to alert their audience about what’s at stake if we lose net neutrality, and what we can do about it before the FCC comment deadline. The goal is for every participant to do whatever the biggest thing they can do is that reaches as much of their audience as possible -- and directs people to where people can submit a comment to the FCC and Congress, like [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com)-

The plan is set. The code is being built. New people and sites are joining every day. Now there’s just one thing left. We need to know what we call this mass online protest! We've got some great ideas, but we want to know what will stick, i.e. what the Internet wants to call it.

We’ve kicked around a ton of ideas, and maybe it doesn’t need a name beyond “Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality,” but we decided to open it up for more feedback and ideas from the Internet. **So that’s where you come in. Please suggest ideas for names of the July 12 day of action in the comments, and note it by starting your comment with “PROPOSAL.” Then people can upvote names they like, and comment on them to suggest variations.**

**What makes a good name?**

1. It clearly describes both the problem (what taking away net neutrality would do to the Internet) and the solution (what we are doing on July 12 in response.) -- For example the “SOPA Blackout” and the “Internet Slowdown.” The most important thing is that it makes it clear to people what they should do on that day to participate.

2. It’s short, one or two words, and also makes a good hashtag and headline for a page.

3. It’s accessible to a wide range of people, doesn’t use insider jargon or inside jokes or confusing terminology, and does not come off as partisan.

**The ones that we’ve come up with so far are:** Internet Shutdown, Break the Internet, The Slowpocalypse, Internet Day, and Internet Emergency.

We may end up having more than one “nickname” for the day of action, so feel free to go wild, get creative, and let’s come up with something to call this awesome thing that we are all doing together to defend the free and open Internet that we love.

technology,Warning for net neutrality day of action: don't point traffic directly at the FCC's website. It is unreliable and has crashed repeatedly. Use a site like BattleForTheNet.com that stores and queues comments and ensures that they get submitted even if the FCC's site goes down.,"The title basically says it all. If you're participating in the [Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) and planning to use one of [the widgets](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12#join) on your website or blog, or help drive traffic on social media or from a Twitch, Vimeo, or YouTube channel, I strongly encourage you NOT to point people directly to the FCC.gov website.

My organization, [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org), has been involved in raising awareness about net neutrality since before the last round of this fight in 2014-2015. Together with our partners we've helped deliver millions of comments to the FCC. Over the years, we've seen the FCC website crash repeatedly under even moderate traffic. More recently, they claimed they experienced a DDoS attack at the exact moment that large numbers of people would have been attempting to comment following the John Oliver segment.

The fact is, the FCC's site just isn't reliable. If you want to make 100% sure that your comment will end up in the docket, use one of the sites set up by public interest groups that store and queue comments to ensure that they get submitted even if the FCC's site crashes.

Here are two options:
https:/www.battleforthenet.com -- run by the broad coalition behind the July 12 day of action, also allows users to call and email their lawmakers, which is an important part of the strategy for winning net neutrality. https://dearfcc.org/ -- run by our friends at the EFF.

If you want to build something yourself, that's cool too, but the bottom line is if anyone points significant traffic at the FCC's site on July 12, it will probably fall apart, so use one of these resources instead to make sure that every voice gets heard.",5,272,2017-06-30,TECH,0.053079988807439804,0.9204890131950378,0.02643098495900631
