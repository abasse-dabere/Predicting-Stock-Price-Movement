technology,"NVIDIA Pulls Bad Drivers, Toasted GPUs On The Rampage","Reports have been flooding in from all over the web. The newest NVIDIA WHQL drivers, 196.75, have been pulled from the NVIDIA downloads page, after reports surfaced of fried GPUs. There have been many posts on the NVIDIA forums already with little response. Their initial suspicion of this issue is that of fan speed controls, possibly some sort of malfunction that is still being rooted out.

There is no word yet on if NVIDIA will allow extended RMAs for these happenstances. There is yet no specific cause for these software faults and whether or not they only affect certain models or brands is inconclusive. Most of the time, problems are caused from resource intensive games such as WoW or Crysis.

An NVIDIA Technician has posted a somewhat relaxing comment on the NVIDIA forums:

    “We are currently are investigating the matter to determine the appropriate next steps. I'll update the forums of any new developments.”

As per described, it’s highly recommended to uninstall these faulty drivers and use the latest stable that is now posted on NVIDIA’s download section. Stay tuned as the story develops.",17,19,2010-03-06,TECH,0.48920243978500366,0.490132212638855,0.020665308460593224

gadgets,"In response to that Mac vs. PC post yesterday, what was the last product that you purchased based on its *quality* and not on quantifiable measures?","[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ba4sm/mac_vs_pc_end_of_discussion/) post yesterday got me thinking: consumers typically don't buy things based on quality; they would rather shop by numbers.

I used to work at Circuit City (back when we used to have those), and I can't tell you the number of customers I had who would buy TVs by looking at the tags without ever looking at the sets themselves.  Manufacturers have figured out that if they post numbers like ""contrast ratios"" (which are largely made up because there are [several different ways to measure them and fudge the numbers](http://www.avrev.com/home-theater-news/industry-trade-news/the-fraud-of-cooking-up-contrast-ratios.html)), consumers will buy a crappy set just because it has better numbers, or a more expensive set because it has quantifiable advantages that their eyes can't even perceive.

Some manufacturers try to make the mundane sound spectacular, like with the Sony still-cameras that claim to shoot ""1080p"" *images*  (1920x1080…just over two megapixels, real impressive…) or the 10 megapixel cameras that still take horribly grainy images.

I guess this is obsession with numbers is a kind of a defense mechanism.  There are plenty of companies that want to sell us overpriced [shit](http://gunnars.com/?gclid=CNXF8PXYp6ACFSFy5QodOyZfag) that claim to do a lot of things that they cannot quantify (because they are made up).  

But there are still some areas in the middle where the product does have a quality that cannot be simply addressed with numbers.  For example, in the Mac vs. PC post listed above, the creator didn't take into account the fact that the Apple Cinema displays have much higher color accuracy than your cheapo $200 LCDs because this is something that is hard to quantify and compare.  In general, Apple dances around this line by offering products that can be good in ways that cannot be quantified (*unibody* macbook pro?  I guess I need that...).

I also like to bring up the example of lenses.  Pro-mature/Professional camera users have the advantage that the product they buy relies heavily on a non-quantifiable information (like barrel-distortion, chromatic aberration, resistance to dust accumulation), yet has a userbase that is largely skeptical of marketing bullshit.

I purchased a $900 lens last year.  Whenever people ask me about it and learn the price, their first response is always ""But it doesn't even zoom in very far!""  I guess I could have gone with the $250 zoom, but the quality of my images would have suffered.

**TLDR**

So I was just posing the question, what was the last item or gadget that you purchased for reasons that can't be easily listed on a product sheet?  Was it worth it?

Here are the features I want:

- Ability to transfer music to and from with out the use of third party software. 
- The ability to use the device as storage.
- At least 10 Gig.
- Durable.
- Genuinely easy to use interface.

The first two on the list are the main reason I'm ditching the iPod. The rest are things which my iPod has which I want to keep. As far as video goes, I don't mind if the device can't play video but if it does I would only find it useful if it was able to play videos in common formats without the need for a time consuming transcode. I'm not too worried about being able to browse the web or check my emails although if I could find a device that would let me do those things as easily as my iPod does then that would be a bonus.

What do you guys recommend? What should I look at?

PS: While I'll admit that some of the 'collecting and sharing' I'll be doing is illegal under current copyright law, I will say that not all of it is. I'm a musician and am often frustrated that I can't copy recordings which I have permission to copy (often directly from the computer of the creator) directly to my iPod without having to load them into my iTunes library on my computer at home first. This is particularly frustrating if I'm out of town at the time or am using a Linux based OS at the time.",69,19,2010-03-07,TECH,0.03419811651110649,0.933954119682312,0.031847696751356125

technology,Charter Tried To Con Me And Lied About It,"I use a LinkSys router.  I've had it set up and working perfectly for over a year.  Well, the past few months, we've had several disconnects from Charter.  We're paying for 10mbps service, but for the past week straight it would not go above 2mbps, and that's if it worked at all.  We called Charter, and they had us plug the modem directly into the machine and Voila! over 20mbps speeds!

 They asked what brand router we had, and when we told them they said that it was too old and incompatible (WRTG54, not that old at all), and pressured my roommate (the primary account holder) into renting one from them that would work better.  I mean *really* pressed the issue with him.  Obviously, we said no, that we'd been using the Linksys for years and it had been fine.

 Well, here we are the next day with NO internet.  I could not get an IP address AT ALL on our Linksys router.  So, I tried another Linksys that I had sitting around.  AGAIN, no IP address AT ALL.  Charter told us that since the modem works when plugged directly into the machine that our routers must be bad and we needed to rent one from them.  Again, we told them no.  I suspected that they might have blocked the spectrum of Linksys MAC addresses, so I cloned my PC's MAC address to the Linksys and it INSTANTLY connected.  Our bad, out of date, incompatible Linksys router suddenly is getting the 20mbps speeds that our PC's were getting.

 I am aware that the modem ""grabs"" the MAC of whatever it's plugged into when it's powercycled.  For example, moving the ethernet cable from my machine to my roommates would NOT work unless the modem was powercycled after the move to ""grab"" the new MAC address.  This is not the issue here.  It seems Charter is blocking the MAC addresses of Linksys devices at our home after we told them we had a Linksys and refused to buy their router because ours was ""broken.""

Obviously we're fine because I know how to clone a MAC address (a VERY simple process in a Linksys device) but so many other people don't.  Is this legal?  At the very least, it's shady and disgusts me.

I just wanted to make Reddit aware of the practice.

EDIT:  Google ""charter +linksys"" ~ This is apparently common practice and I am not the only person with this story.

EDIT 2: Charter's still not helping us with the issue, they simply refuse to support anything other than their own equipment.  For now, we cloned my roommate MAC instead of mine, because when I take my computer elsewhere and plug it in, it takes down the network at my apartment.  I haven't had the time to really press the issue with Charter further as I work full time and am a full time student, but I will most likely at least e-mail bomb management with some questions.  I am looking into getting that info now.",865,1745,2010-03-18,TECH,0.07191295921802521,0.9049323797225952,0.023154698312282562

technology,"Charter cable lied to my face twice and I'm sorry but I just have to vent on here. What a shady, dishonest company.","So in my new house I can't get dish because of trees and unfortunately had to get Charter HD cable. When I signed up the agent quoted me a price for the ""Digital Home"" package and linked me to this website showing the different packages http://www.charter.com/Visitors/Channels.aspx

But on that list there is nothing called ""Digital Home"" just ""Digital View"". I told the agent that and she said ""Digital Home is the same as Digital View"". Later I contacted them again and *again* an agent gave me a price for Digital Home and said that this would include all of the Digital View packages.

So after a few days I realize I am not getting any of those channels and I contact them and they say ""I'm sorry, for that price you do *not* get Digital View channels. When you spoke to the first agent she had a system error that cause her to tell you that."" and I said ""What about the second agent that said the exact same thing?!' And he said ""She had an error too.""

WOW. WTF!

So I ask for a supervisor and go off, saying they told me a price and what channels I would get, now once I sign up you say ""Oops, you don't actually get any of those channels for that price, if you want those channels you have to pay more.""

So the supervisor is all apologetic and says he will take care of it. I say ""So you are going to give me the channels you originally told me for the price you originally quoted?""

And he says, ""More or less.""

I go, ""What do you mean, 'more or less'?""

And he says, ""They will give you those channels, but you will have to pay more.""

WOW. Thanks. Great resolution to the problem. I'm calling AT&amp;T monday to get U-verse tv.

tl;dr: Charter twice quoted me a price and gave me a list of channels I would get for that price. Once I signed up they said ""Oops, you don't get any of those channels, the agents had system errors which caused them to give you wrong info. If you want those channels it is $20 more than we said""",161,125,2010-03-28,TECH,0.06345466524362564,0.9084538817405701,0.028091417625546455
