technology,LinkedIn class action lawsuit,"Just received this email but their site is getting hammered, so I can't register just yet:

You are receiving this e-mail because you may have used LinkedIn's Add Connections feature between September 17, 2011 and October 31, 2014.

A federal court authorized this Notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.

Why did I get this notice? This Notice relates to a proposed settlement (""Settlement"") of a class action lawsuit (""Action"") against LinkedIn Corporation (""LinkedIn"") based on LinkedIn's alleged improper use of a service called ""Add Connections"" to grow its member base.

What is the Action about? The Action challenges LinkedIn's use of a service called Add Connections to grow its member base. Add Connections allows LinkedIn members to import contacts from their external email accounts and email connection invitations to one or more of those contacts inviting them to connect on LinkedIn. If a connection invitation is not accepted within a certain period of time, up to two ""reminder emails"" are sent reminding the recipient that the connection invitation is pending. The Court found that members consented to importing their contacts and sending the connection invitation, but did not find that members consented to LinkedIn sending the two reminder emails. The Plaintiffs contend that LinkedIn members did not consent to the use of their names and likenesses in those reminder emails. LinkedIn denies these allegations and any and all wrongdoing or liability. No court or other entity has made a judgment or other determination of any liability.

What relief does the Settlement provide? LinkedIn has revised disclosures, clarifying that up to two reminders are sent for each connection invitation so members can make fully-informed decisions before sending a connection invitation. In addition, by the end of 2015, LinkedIn will implement new functionality allowing members to stop reminders from being sent by canceling the connection invitation. LinkedIn has also agreed to pay $13 million into a fund that can be used, in part, to make payments to members of the Settlement Class who file approved claims. Attorneys representing the Settlement Class will petition the Court for payment of the following from the fund: (1) reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs up to a maximum of $3,250,000, and (2) service awards for the Plaintiffs up to a maximum of $1,500 each. The payment amount for members of the Settlement Class who file approved claims will be calculated on a pro rata basis, which means that it will depend on the total number of approved claims. If the number of approved claims results in a payment amount of less than $10, LinkedIn will pay an additional amount up to $750,000 into the fund. If the pro rata amount is so small that it cannot be distributed in a way that is economically feasible, payments will be made, instead, to Cy Pres Recipients selected by the Parties and approved by the Court. No one knows in advance whether or in what amount payments will be made to claimants.

technology,I contacted the FCC recently about Comcast's Data Caps in my area...,"Comcast is starting its data caps of 300GB/month in my area this month, and needless to say, I was pretty outraged when I got the message in September. So, I threw a complaint to the FCC expressing my dissatisfaction with a company that claims is making ""pro-consumer options"" is in fact, well, bull as we're all aware.

Not getting anything from the FCC, I had gotten one phone call and an e-mail from Comcast. That week, I had become very ill and could barely speak. I managed to throw an e-mail reply but never got a response back. A week or so later, I had recovered, but still never got a reply.

Today, I happened to get a piece of mail sent by Comcast to both the FCC and myself. It was obviously full of corporate run-around nonsense, but the biggest points of hypocrisy in it were the following (this is a word-for-word re-typing of the letter):

- ""Comcast is strongly committed to maintaining an open Internet."" (Oh so is that why you put millions into trying to get Net Neutrality shot down, and forced Netflix to pay more?)

- ""The FCC has previously recognized that usage-based pricing for Internet service is a legitimate billing practice that may benefit consumers by offering them more choices over a greater range of service options -- The vast majority of XFINITY Internet customers use less than 300 GB of data per month -- **(they) should therefore see no increase in their monthly service fees** -- This pro-consumer policy helps to ensure that Comcast's customers are being treated fairly, such that those customers, like Mr. &lt;my name&gt;, who choose to use more, can pay more to do so, **and that customers who choose to use less, pay less**.""

I just want to understand how they first say that there is no increase in fees for the customers who use &lt; 300GB, and then go on to say that those customers pay less. They're paying the exact same amount, while people who go over are now forced to pay an additional $30/month, and that's suddenly me being treated fairly? Am I crazy or do you all see the blatant hypocrisy here as well?

Edit: I have just updated my FCC complaint to include the letter. I was half-tempted to link them to this Reddit thread! (seriously, you guys rock)

PS: If anyone happens to know good service providers in the Tamarac, Florida area, please let me know. We're moving there shortly (from one area of Florida to another) and would love to be unchained from these corporate douchebags.",759,3335,2015-10-03,TECH,0.06576758623123169,0.9075779914855957,0.026654424145817757

technology,The Senate lost hundreds of thousands of faxes from citizens against CISA (proof),"This week, the Senate is expected to vote on CISA, a controversial cybersecurity bill, without having seen hundreds of faxes from concerned citizens urging them to vote against this legislation. The faxes were sent via the **www.faxbigbrother.com** campaign, which criticized CISA as a mass surveillance bill in disguise. Unfortunately, once received by the Senate’s fax system, the majority of these faxes were lost or deleted, without ever reaching the offices of the senators.

This is not ok. We don't care why or how, but the Senate must hear from their constituents if they are trying to communicate with them. That's their job and they should admit they failed to do so.

**Full disclosure:** I’m Jeff Lyon, CTO at Fight for the Future and the architect of the faxing system we used to send these faxes. I’ll explain how we built the system, and how, with the help of a couple of friendly senators, we proved that the faxes were lost from the Senate’s system.

1. **We built a server capable of blanketing the Senate with faxes ([pic](http://i.imgur.com/29L3C6l.jpg))**
    Powered by 12 US Robotics faxmodems, 12 dedicated phone lines, and running out of my attic, this allowed us to send 20,000 faxes every day to the U.S. Senate

2. **Over 6 million faxes were generated by concerned citizens on www.faxbigbrother.com**
    We didn’t expect such a mind blowing number, but we were sending them as fast as we could. We delivered over 400,000 of these faxes in August, and the system _seemed_ to be working beautifully.    

3. **In September, we heard from Senator Ron Wyden’s office that they weren’t receiving our faxes.**
    We took the fax system offline to do some testing. Wyden’s office confirmed receiving only 743 of the 6,220 faxes we sent to them.

4. **We reached out to the [Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA)](http://www.senate.gov/reference/office/sergeant_at_arms.htm) to get more information about the problem**
    The Sergeant at Arms is responsible for Senate operations, including the telecommunication systems the Senate uses for receiving faxes. We explained the problem via phone and email, in the hopes that they could locate the missing faxes.

5. **Weeks later, SAA replied that they weren’t getting our faxes and not blocking them ([screenshot of email](http://i.imgur.com/kUvuzY8.png))**
    This is when we knew something had gone very wrong. We have database records confirming the faxes were sent. I had been monitoring the performance of the faxing system throughout its operation, keeping an eye as the faxes were sent in realtime. It’s kind of hard to ignore the screeching of dialup faxmodems, and modems don’t screech unless there’s another modem on the other end receiving data. I decided to ask my phone company for a detailed statement of our phone call history.


6. **In early October, I finally received an 860 page phone bill showing all our calls in August ([pic](http://i.imgur.com/IS0DI7S.jpg) | [another pic](http://i.imgur.com/jAOhdbe.jpg))**
    The phone company initially sent a bill without our full call history, and it took weeks to get them to send me the full record. This showed hundreds of thousands of calls placed from the same 612 area code phone lines that the SAA claimed to have never received. To clarify, 11 out of 12 of our phone lines were 612 area code. These call records would not exist if the Senate fax lines didn’t pick up our calls and receive data.

**So why did this happen?**

Right now, it doesn’t really matter _why_ this happened. Something went wrong in the Senate’s faxing system, and whether it was a glitch, or something done on purpose to try to stop our faxes from going through, the end result is the same. The Senate was unable to consider timely communications from thousands of constituents, urging them to vote against CISA, a bill they’re debating right now.

And disappointingly, we may never know the truth. Since the Senate is exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests, we’ll never be able to look through their records to see what really happened.

If Congress proceeds to a vote on CISA without considering the wishes of their constituents, our democracy has failed. Please help spread the word and call on Congress to acknowledge this problem before it’s too late.",874,6067,2015-10-20,TECH,0.25791987776756287,0.7173591256141663,0.02472098171710968

See his write-up [here](http://members.efn.org/~paulmd/OwnWork/AdventuresinCensorship.pdf). Now others are coming forth and sharing similar stories with the hashtag #ItsOver. For it's part, twitter is claiming it was a one-time server issue (which could be possible, especially if it's a replication issue) but people have responded to that by saying twitter's timeline of server issues doesn't lineup to reality of people's posts going missing.

If this is true, and I emphasize *if* as this is currently **unverified** this would be a pretty major move on Twitter's part. I posted this here because I know some tech journalists read /r/technology and hopefully this gets some visibility so we can get some clarity on this.
