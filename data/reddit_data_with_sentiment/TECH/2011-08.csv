gadgets,Looking for a universal remote control recommendation,"I've had a Logitech Harmony 880 for a little over two years, and we're gradually losing buttons. First it was the volume down button, annoying, but livable with the dedicated remote for the receiver. Then we lost the menu up button. OK, so we need a third remote for navigating the DVR. Now, the help button is gone (useful for when a step of a macro action was missed for whatever reason), and that's the third strike. The backlight of the hard buttons has always been so dim as to be useless without cupping your hand over the remote.

Not that it's been all heartache with this model. I appreciate the ease of setting it up through the computer software. The macro capabilities are flexible and have been useful.

I'm looking for another universal remote now. I've a little hesitant to get another Logitech because I feel that this one should have lasted a little bit longer, but I'm not completely ruling out another Logitech either.

I have an A/V receiver, cable TV DVR, Apple TV, BluRay player, and LCD TV. Anyone have a recommendation of current universal remotes? Bonus points for ruggedness as I have two young boys in the house.",42,16,2011-08-07,TECH,0.07823904603719711,0.8897976875305176,0.03196319192647934
