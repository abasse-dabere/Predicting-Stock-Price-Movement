[FAQ Section #1](https://dataplan.xfinity.com/faq/) - ""How does the XFINITY Terabyte Internet Data Usage Plan work?""

&gt; The Terabyte Internet Data Usage Plan is a new data usage plan for XFINITY Internet service that provides you with a terabyte (1 TB or 1024 GB) of Internet data usage each month as part of your monthly service.  If you choose to use more than 1 TB in a month, we will automatically add blocks of 50 GB to your account for an additional fee of $10 each.  Your charges, however, will not exceed $200 each month, no matter how much you use.  And, we're offering you two courtesy months, so you will not be billed the first two times you exceed a terabyte.  This data plan is based on a principle of fairness.  Those who use more Internet data, pay more.  And those who use less Internet data, pay less.

&gt; It is important to know that more than 99 percent of our customers do not use a terabyte of data and are not likely to be impacted by this plan, so they can continue to stream, surf, and download without worry.  To see your actual usage, sign in to My Account.

&gt; For customers who use a terabyte or more in a month, we also offer an Unlimited Data Option. The Unlimited Data Option costs an additional fee of $50 per calendar month. The fee is independent of actual data usage. The Terabyte Internet Data Usage Plan will not apply to customers who enroll in the Unlimited Data Option.

Any new threads regarding the issue are getting locked.

Problem Issue: 

Sony's 2016 Bravia line is ill-equiped to handle 4K gaming, as their flagship models have really high levels of input latency. Sony advertises their x930D bravia model as best fit for the PS4 Pro, but users who actually have it face a sever disadvantage when it comes to competitive and even casual games like Battlefield.


Sony also promised a marshmallow update for their 2016 line in sometime October which has been indefinitely postponed without any news.
