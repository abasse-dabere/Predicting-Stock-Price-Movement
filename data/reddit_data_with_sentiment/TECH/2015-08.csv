gadgets,"Amazon Fire Stick will DESTROY your data usage! And by ""destroy"" I mean ""use up your monthly data quota quickly and you'll pay serious overage charges for"".","We had cable TV to all three televisions and a Roku in the living room.  The Comcast bill got out of control so we opted to drop cable and keep the Internet, and stream all our programming. 

Instead of getting Roku for the other two televisions we went with the Amazon Fire Sticks. No good reason. This was near the end of the month. 

A few days later, in the last day of the month, we get a notice that we're at 90% of our data usage with an explanation of what the overage charges would be. I guess that was nice of them to warn us.  Our monthly cap is 300 GB and we were shocked that we'd used so much, and also unaware until that point we even had a cap. 

After checking the wireless router to make sure no unauthorized connections existed we thought it might be the new Fire Sticks. The following day we started over on the August data plan and we used 40 GB!!!! IN ONE DAY! Seriously Amazon??? Unplugged those suckers and the next day used only 3 GB. 

We've installed Roku sticks on all the televisions and have been watching closely for a week and so far we've used about 3 to 10 GB a day. 

TLDR: Amazon Fire Stick used over 4 times the data that Roku uses, and nearly cost us a bundle of money on data overage charges. 

Edit: Yes, it's a data usage cap of 300 GB a month. 
No really, it is. 
Yes, I'm serious, I have a data cap. 
No, I'm not in a 3rd world country and yes I'm aware this is 2015. 
And yes I really do have a data cap. 
We didn't even know we had a cap until we got the Fire Stick so it's possible you have one too. 
This post isn't about my data cap - it's about data usage of the Fire Stick. 
I returned both Fire Sticks and got two Roku sticks. No more data usage problems. Hooray!",972,1950,2015-08-07,TECH,0.057757679373025894,0.9170753955841064,0.02516687661409378
