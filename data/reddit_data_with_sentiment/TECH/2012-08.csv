gadgets,"Avoid ""suntek store"" - they are a scam","This might turn out to be a bit of a story but i wanted to warn someone. (if anyone knows of a better sub-reddit let me know)

***AVOID ""http://www.suntekstore.com/""   as they are a scam operation. ***

I ordered an ipad 1 battery case, they sent me this http://i.imgur.com/U2hFo.jpg  and then they wanted ME to pay THEM more money because it was a product i didn't order.  That's right, they screwed up and didn't want me to send the item back but did want me to now BUY the item, the item i didn't order. 

So i asked them about the item i did order, the ipad 1 battery case. they tell me they can't send any further items until i pay something which apparently [after a number of back and forth emails] at a minimum is the ""restocking fee"" of $2 USD. Looking at the fact that it would cost more than $2 USD to send the item from Australia to Hong Kong and i am already $40 invested in this i figured the $2 was worth to just get the actual item sent. So far i am now thinking i am only out an extra $2 as i was expecting the actual item i ordered to be coming soon. 

So i wait another 10 days and get another item in the post. Straight away without even opening the product i notice something is wrong, the item is very Light. that is to say the product was so light that it was like a few DVDs in weight.  I get inside and open the second package, it was this: http://i.imgur.com/Do4KF.jpg  at least this time the item *looked* like product i ordered.  First and foremost i checked to see if my ipad 1 would fit (i know the box says 2 &amp; 3 but i was still hoopeful) - the ipad 1 does not fit, not even close.  But it is not a real item, the case itself has very little weight and appears to be mostly plastic, in fact i was guessing that there was no electronic parts inside but there is *something*. There was a USB plug down the bottom of the case that was seemingly just super glued and Jammed inside, http://i.imgur.com/PAt9x.jpg  i plugged it into a USB socket and starting charging which did prove that it must have had some small battery inside that can hold some power and turn on the LED lights down the bottom. However after being on charge for over 3 hours the ""battery case"" only shows 75% charged and i have found that the whole thing will go flat (according to the LED lights anyway) in less than an hour, it doesn't hold charge and i doubt it would ever provide power to an ipad for more than 5 minutes. 

I have been back and forth with many emails to this ""company"" and they have offered a partial refund of $5 USD - after paying $40 plus another $2 after the first wrong item for the restocking fee i would be losing pretty much all of it as the cost of $5 could be written off in the amount of time i have wasted with this educational venture. I have already opened the paypal dispute but paypal had a terrible track record with scams like this and in the past i have even had them ask for the item to be returned to the seller as per the official refund policy of the ""store"", which actually ended up costing me money overall.  So even if the paypal thing goes good or bad i will be losing money no matter what, just to break even would be a long shot.  I just hope that no one else gets scammed by these scamming scammers from scamville. 

TLDR: suntekstore.com is a scam and just send fake products to get money. 

***Update***
well it seems the company has found this post and are now trying to bribe me into taking down the post. 

&gt;Thanks a lot for your reply. Yes, we can issue full refund to you. But since your comment is very important to our business. Could you please change your feedback on http://bit.ly/O3qjMx first?
If you have done, please let us know, we will fully refund to you asap. Thank you for your help in advance. 


so they are now saying that i can get a full refund where as previously they were only offering $5 or $8. interesting, their horrible conduct and attempt at bribery is shameful at best.  I can only guess how many other people have taken the money and deleted their bad reviews. 

Also, I am still waiting to hear from paypal about it. so far the only email sent from paypal was stating that the seller has provided shipping information... i'm not quite sure what that means, i have received 2 items and neither is the one that was meant to be sent in the first place, and i never received any tracking information before hand.

**UPDATE 2**

WIN! - well it seems something actually went right here as i just got an email from paypal saying that i have received a full refund. 

&gt;We have concluded our investigation into your Buyer Claim

even though i am still out the $2 restocking fee as that wasn't part of the ""initial purchase"", and aside from the 2 months of time wasted trying to just order 1 single item, which resulted in 22 emails from the ""company"". All in all the final result is better than expected. so yay!    and educational experience was had.",70,329,2012-08-13,TECH,0.030196573585271835,0.8505632877349854,0.11924012750387192
