technology,"Why does Google STILL not let you turn location-based searching off? This isn't just a rant, I actually would like an answer.","""The customization of search results based on location is an important component of a consistent, high-quality search experience. Therefore, we haven't provided a way to turn off location customization, although we've made it easy for you to set your own location or to customize using a general location as broad as the country that matches your local domain.""

I am British but living in Spain for a year. I speak Spanish, but would prefer search results in English. Also the two things I use Google most for are for tech help and mathematics, for both of which location is irrelevant and only limits my results.

Now, I've set my browser homepage to https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en which works, but I mostly search from the address bar in chrome, which will always search google.es, and so does every search made from my phone. If I ever follow a link to the Android market, which I do every day, I have to then scroll down and select ""English"". Every day.

You really can't turn it off. Make a search and on the left it will have your location and allow you to set your location. When I type in ""USA"" it says ""USA? That's not in Spain."" and ignores me.

I'm a huge fan of Google and use a lot of their products, and it's just so weird that they'd impose a bad feature like this on everyone with no way to turn it off. There are many threads on its help forum such as [this one](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Web+Search/thread?tid=3818ae383c3ccfed) and [this one](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Web%20Search/thread?tid=7777da521339a9b4&amp;hl=en) which let them know that there are a great many people for which the feature only ever holds them back.

Like I said in the title I'm not just complaining, I just want a single reason why it's impossible to turn off. I know there are a couple of Google employees on reddit. If anyone has a workaround thet would be great too.

technology,I have a chance to present thorium power to the U.N. Secretary General's advisory team on climate change,"MIT has an annual contest to crowdsource solutions to global warming. I've made it to finalist with an entry that advocates liquid thorium reactors, along with other advanced reactors and various other technologies.

At this point, a winner will be chosen by popular vote. Anyone can log in and vote. [My entry is here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/5/planId/15204) if you're so inclined. 

That's under National, I also have an [entry in the Global] category which is a subset of National. I wrote that one before I learned about thorium etc., but if I win both I'll be able to devote most of my National presentation to thorium.

Last year I was a winner in this contest. We went to the U.N. and had a nice roundtable discussion with the group that directly advises the Sec Gen on climate change issues. The next week we had a more formal presentation to congressional staffers. That'll happen this year too.

Right now I have a narrow lead on Global, and a strong lead on National but a team in India is catching up fast. Voting continues through Tuesday.

You can vote here if you want:

[National](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/5/planId/15204)

[Global](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/4/planId/15203)

**EDIT**: One vote per person on each entry, please. Things are going great, and duplicate votes just make work for the MIT guys who have to filter them out.

Much love to [@mpetricone](http://twitter.com/mpetricone), [@mrcjdawson](http://twitter.com/mrcjdawson), [@thinktankhero](http://twitter.com/thinktankhero), [@micahsch](http://twitter.com/micahsch), and [@leahbel](http://twitter.com/leahbel).

It was a day full of intimate, frank discussions that put faces &amp; stories (ours) behind why this legislation would be so awful. I told my story, and how in a ProtectIP world it simply couldn't have happened. We all want to stop the bad guys, but doing *this* would obliterate one of the few growing sectors of our economy (one that we're also out-innovating the rest of the world in) and ruin the beautiful meritocracy that is the world wide web.

I hope I did you all justice and though I didn't sleep much last night, you all were instrumental in helping craft what I'd say and how I'd say it. Thank you.

Our schedule:

 * Michael Daum, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA)
 * Neeta Bidwai, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA)

([I missed the first two because I was doing a livechat with Mashable](http://mashable.com/2011/11/16/alexis-ohanian-live-chat-announce/))
 
 * Rob Seidman, Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH)
 * Jack Smedile, Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO)
 * Josh Finestone, Senator Dean Heller (R-NV)
 * Mark Colwell, Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS)
 * Congressman Jason Chaffettz (R-UT)

And here's a great bit of progress that came out this evening:

Senator Morin, who we met today, came out with a statement against Protect IP, saying he (and Rand Paul [R] &amp; Maria Cantwell [D]) will put a hold on it. Now we've got solid bipartisan concerns voiced in both houses of Congress. But there's still lots more work to be done!

http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111117/15492016808/senators-rand-paul-jerry-moran-maria-cantwell-all-warn-that-protect-ip-will-kill-jobs.shtml


The major two points I'm hitting are (1) how *awful* it is for the tech industry (e.g., my own entrepreneurial story of reddit wouldn't have happened), which continues to be one of the few strong parts of our economy and [~~(2) it's censorship~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/meg8w/im_hoping_to_testify_before_congress_on_thursday/c308qy0) (leaving this argument to my cohorts who are actually experts and not just angry people like me).

I'll use as little humor as possible and will be wearing a suit, basically trying to come close to this [awesomeness from Mike Rowe](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/dirtyjobs/mike-rowe-senate-testimony.html). Suggestions?

The day after I posted it up here more than a dozen sites picked it up and shared it netting it more than 8,000 signatures in one day, No other Petition had those kind of numbers, not even the marijuana one. And in my opinion unlike the marijuana one, the Stop SOPA petition I truly think could change something since it has not yet become a law. Call me an optimist.

Seriously though, never could have done it without you guys in R/technology, Thanks.

**Edit:** I just found out that from yesterday to today the petition gained over 15,000 sigs from various sources, (including another link on reddit.) Holy. Shit.

technology,"Now I'm no conspiracy nut, but about these White House petitions...","Lately, there have been more and more people signing electronic petitions over at [We The People](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions) on the White House's website.  How feasible is it that the purpose of this website (or at the very least, one of several uses) is for tracking and data-mining political/social movements?  I mean, they gather geographic location information, first and last name, IP addresses, and keep track of which petitions each user signs.

With enough users, signatures, and petitions, the government will amass an enormous amount of data from which they can extrapolate things like where movements start, how movements spread, how likely a person is to vote for issue D based upon their votes on issues A/B/C, political opinion by location, and plenty of other things that a man much more clever than I will be able to deduce.

This isn't even including things such as website referrers; I'm sure that they can and do keep track of what sorts of websites link to what sorts of petitions, which can in turn lead to the monitoring of and/or some negative action against the website.

I've only just begun to think of the possibilities, but I think it may be safe to say that this is a new wealth of information for the government and that it may have many sinister applications.

technology,Apple is required to replace faulty MagSafe power adapters that shipped with various MacBook models. Apple technical support refuses to tell you which models are affected without first purchasing their AppleCare Protection Plan.,"I happened across an article (on reddit, of course) concerning Apple's [faulty MagSafe power adapters which represent a fire hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe#Criticisms_and_defects). As a MacBook owner, I set about trying to determine which models were affected as my MagSafe power adapter, too, was fraying. I contacted Apple's technical support department as recommended at [Apple's website](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4127). The woman at the other end refused to tell me

(1) which models were eligible for replacement;
(2) where I could find additional information about the recall; and, (3) how I could go about replacing the faulty MagSafe power adapter. With every question, the woman at the other end told me that I would have to purchase AppleCare in order for her to answer any of my questions. In fact, [apple.com](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4127) states that the user should contact Apple Technical Support for additional information. Eventually, I made an appointment to meet with a ""Genius"" at my local Apple Store to replace the faulty adapter. When I asked the rep about Apple's lack of candor pertaining to this matter he told me that he was aware that this was the case but that there was nothing that he could do about it.

technology,SOPA - How The Taliban Do It,"**Note:** I was writing about this experience for an English course, then realized how applicable it was in regards to SOPA. It might be tough for some to see why SOPA is such a big deal, hope this helps.


As a soldier in Afghanistan I had the opportunity to experience many things that are uncommon to most westerners. My team and I spent several months patrolling a series of remote villages along a seasonal river in order to build a better relationship with the people in the area.

The area was one of the least visited by international forces. On multiple occasions I met nomads that had never seen westerners and some who thought we might be Russians (who had been there in the 1980's). I met very few people in the area that were able to read. Schools were found mainly in cities. It was rare for locals in these villages to travel much, with many individuals spending the entirety of their life in the same village of maybe a hundred people. During my time in these villages I did not once see a woman over the age of around 8 or so. The only source of electricity in the area was through running a power line off of a car or motorcycle battery, which would allow one to charge a cell phone or radio. There were no landlines, no internet access, basically no telecommunications. Hardly anyone can read and so there are very few books or newspapers. 

A national telecommunications company had tried to erect a cell tower in the area. The tower lasted only a week or so before local Taliban blew it up. Initially I wasn't sure as to why the Taliban had blown up the tower as they could benefit from use of the tower as well. What I soon came to realize is that what they feared was the knowledge that would come with cell phones.

After spending a considerable amount of time with the locals it became clear that their only source of information, of news, was by word of mouth. A majority of what they knew about the outside world came from travelers, and a significant portion of the travelers through the area were Taliban. The Taliban in the area were able to effectively control the incoming knowledge of the local populace as the only source of new information came from travelers (word of mouth). Additionally, the Taliban set up random checkpoints in and out of the area in order to control both the goods that were coming in and out of the area as well as the people and thus the knowledge.

From an outsider's perspective it was easy to see that the Taliban were controlling and manipulating the local population, to the benefit of the Taliban and detriment of the locals. They were effectively spreading propaganda against the central government and against international forces. The locals, however, had no way of knowing that they were being controlled and manipulated in a way that was detrimental to their own well-being.

This may be an oversimplification, but you don't know what you don't know. If you've never been exposed to a certain material, a certain set of knowledge, then you can know neither its validity nor its significance. It's been said that knowledge will set you free. For those of us that already have a good deal in the way of personal freedom, I'd say that knowledge is what will keep us free. 
     
The United States has been a worldwide leader when it comes to freedom of information. It's my assessment that SOPA is a step backwards, a step that will neither help the general public nor the majority of US businesses. Not everything regarding U.S. copyright bill is bad, but the manner of enforcement and the liability placed on businesses and individuals by this bill could be extremely detrimental. 

If you think it really can't be that bad go ahead and read it yourself:

**tl;dr** Went to Afghanistan, saw the Taliban blowing up cell towers and setting up road blocks to control information. Don't like my senators/congressman trying to shut down part of our most influential means of communication.
