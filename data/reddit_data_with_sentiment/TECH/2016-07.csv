technology,"Tell-all book alleges that Facebook is rife with sexism and run like a ""North Korean cult""","http://www.techspot.com/news/65429-tell-all-book-alleges-facebook-rife-sexism-run.html

&gt;It’s claimed that Zuckerberg had a tendency to explode and swear at staff, leading to them nicknaming him “the little emperor.” Martinez also claims that the CEO has a KGB-like internal police force called “the Sec,” which monitored every move staff made.

&gt;One of the more famous incidents in the book is when Zuckerberg declared “total war” on Google following the launch of Google Plus. He allegedly put the entire company on lockdown – stopping anyone from leaving the building – and started quoting Cato the Elder, one of his favorite philosophers. “‘Everyone walked out of there ready to invade Poland if need be,” said Martinez.

&gt;Facebook prides itself on being a modern, progressive company. So one of the most damning claims is that sexism is rife within its walls. The book alleges that human resource managers gave speeches to new female employees in which they were told never to wear “distracting clothes.” Any that failed to comply were “read the riot act.”",31,43,2016-07-03,TECH,0.1202317327260971,0.8584840297698975,0.021284207701683044

&gt; We’re writing to let you know that we will be trialing a new XFINITY Internet data usage plan in your area. Starting August 1, 2016, your monthly XFINITY Internet service will include a terabyte data usage plan (that’s 1,024 GB).

&gt; With 1 terabyte of data you can stream about 700 hours of HD video, play more than 12,000 hours of online games, or download 600,000 high-res photos in a month. If you believe you will need more data, we also offer an Unlimited Data Option.

&gt; Your average data usage for the past three months is 525 GB, so based on your historical usage, with this new plan you can stream, surf, game, download or do whatever you want online, worry free. Less than 1% of Comcast XFINITY Internet customers use a terabyte of data or more in a month.

&gt; Details of the Terabyte and Unlimited Plans:
&gt; 1 Terabyte (TB) included/month	If 1 TB is exceeded, $10 for each additional data block of up to 50 GB/month	$200 overage limit - no matter how much data you use
&gt; Unlimited Data	$50 per month	No overage charges — no matter how much data you use
&gt; You can also track and manage your usage so there are never any surprises about how much data you use. Here are a few tools you can use:
&gt; Usage meter – Monitor how much data you have used with our Data Usage Meter.
&gt; Data Usage Calculator - Estimate your data usage with our
&gt; Calculator Tool. Simply enter how often and how much you typically use the Internet, and the calculator will estimate your monthly data usage.
&gt; Notifications - Should you approach a terabyte of usage, we will send you a courtesy ""in-browser"" notice and an email letting you know when you reach 90%, 100%, 110%, and 125% of that amount. Usage notifications will not be sent to customers who enroll in the unlimited data option. Learn more about notifications here.
&gt; For the small percentage of customers who use more than a terabyte of data, we will offer them two courtesy months so they will not be billed the first two times they exceed a terabyte while they are getting comfortable with the new data usage plan. If you have any questions about the new data usage plan, please see our FAQs.

&gt; Thank you for being an XFINITY Internet Customer.

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; John Crowley
&gt; Regional Senior Vice President of Comcast’s Greater Chicago Region

&gt; Please note that this is a consumer trial. Comcast may modify or discontinue this trial at any time. However, we will notify you in advance of any such change.

technology,"Since you can be forced to unlock your phone with a fingerprint, Apple and Android Manufacturers should let users set up a ""killswitch"" fingerprint.","Kind of a technology showerthought, if you will.

The thought me and a friend had was you would set a fingerprint up as a killswitch. If you use that finger in place of your normal digit to unlock your phone, it would disable the fingerprint logon indefinitely until the PIN was used to unlock. Once the PIN is entered fingerprint unlock would be reinstated.

It isn't perfect, and there is the chance the you will be physically forced to use your pointer digit (you could always use a non-standard finger to normal unlock) but it still seems like it would a great security feature.

EDIT: To those who have concerns (which are valid) over something like this catching an obstruction of justice type charge, another thing I'd like to see is a timeout option. If the phone is locked for more than 1, 2, 3, etc. hours or minutes it requires a PIN.

technology,Samsung Galaxy and other Smart Phone Bloatware,"So this is just a topic I wanted to bring up to r/technology to see if others have experienced anything similar to this. We all know smart phone companies install bloatware on their devices. This is common practice not only in the smart phone realm, but home computing in general.

My problem was this, I have a Galaxy S5. I recently just updated to the latest version of android Samsung offered. With it came a myraid of other software previously not on my phone. Such as the abomination that is Samsung Plus. This stupid thing is like a hydra with a million other pieces of software that bogged my phone down to a tiny crawl. Samsung Plus stated it was ""fixing"" my phone and running ""diagnostics"", bullshit. It told me among other things my battery was ""dying"". Ok, I thought to myself I mean the phone is getting older and I use it a lot, but what I noticed is the life of my battery was cut in half after Samsung Plus was installed, and it kept throwing up warnings at awful times about battery usage, running out of space, running out of ram, ext.. 

I finally got sick of having to charge my phone at lunchtime because from 8 a.m. to noon I would lose about 80% battery life.  Of course I couldn't normally remove or disable Samsung Plus because me being the idiot I was, I enrolled in Samsung's Software account back when I bought the device, silly me thinking maybe this company might have something to offer...

Anyway the point is I finally rooted my device and went through the meticulous task of culling all bloatware from the device. Magically my battery functions again, the random lag spikes opening texts went away and my 2 something year old phone runs like the day I bought it. (Been on it all morning at this point and I'm still at 85% battery... wow). 

So why would Samsung intentionally put system software on a device that totally destroys the experience for the end user I thought? The only conclusion I've come to is to force you to want to buy a new phone. I've been getting letter after letter in the mail and emails about my upgrade time being ready to renew. That I should check out the new S7 and on and on... My curiosity is if within this software is something Samsung could use to systematically degrade devices it want's to ""stop supporting"" in an effort to make the consumer want a new device thinking theirs is ""dying or out of date"". That's some pretty shady dirty crap in my opinion, but wouldn't be beyond the realms of possibility. Has anyone else noticed this kind of thing on their older devices? Cause there was NOTHING wrong with mine, all my problems in performance stemmed from Samsung Plus. So unless Samsung is intentionally trying to make people want to hate their phone, why force it onto everyone's device if they know it cannot run the software? and has no reason too run it. And falsely claiming my battery was dying, cause it wasn't. 

Am I just being a conspiracy theorist or is this possibly a real, underhanded business practice they are employing to sell new phones? Let me know what you think. 

Edit: as this blew up and many have asked this is what I followed to root my S5. This is NOT my video, and had never done this before either. However it's pretty straight forward and only took me about 15 minutes to actually complete. Make sure you pay attention to your devices firmware, the wrong one will brick you phone. He goes over how to check it though in the video, it's very easy.

technology,"UPDATE: ""You CAN get rid of Cortana's presence entirely"" ""in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update""","Hey, /r/technology - I found this really interesting article you should all read: http://www.pcworld.com/article/3100358/windows/you-cant-turn-off-cortana-in-the-windows-10-anniversary-update.html

- ""Cortana works best when you sign in, but if you choose not to, you can still use her to chat, search the web and your Windows device,"" Microsoft told PCWorld. ""If you like, you can also easily hide Cortana and the search box in the taskbar altogether.""

- You can also take a few steps to limit Cortana's reach on your system. First, head to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Speech, inking, &amp; typing. Now click on Stop getting to know me and then select Turn off. This effectively makes Cortana deaf to the sound of your voice as well as blind to your typing history and—for stylus wielders— handwriting patterns. It also turns off system-wide dictation.

- On Cortana’s settings screen, disable every slider that can be set to Off, such as search history and device history. That helps prevent some data usage and tracking, but Cortana will still be working.

- ***You can even get rid of Cortana's presence entirely, as Microsoft said.*** To do this right-click on the Cortana search box, and select ""Hidden"". Doing so, however, apparently makes the Cortana box disappear without any obvious way of getting her back.

- If you’re still unsatisfied after you’ve crippled as much of Cortana as possible, **consider ditching it completely** and going with a third-party system search utility instead.

You just need to get past the headline of the article, because buried deep down past the first graphic is instructions that contradict the article's own head-line premise. It's like the editors just went for a title that was provocative to lure people into clicking on it.",230,606,2016-07-27,TECH,0.05541198328137398,0.9160335063934326,0.028554562479257584
