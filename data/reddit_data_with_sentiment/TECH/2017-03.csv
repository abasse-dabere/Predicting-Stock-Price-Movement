technology,"FYI: On the FCC, it's always the Democrats who fight to preserve net neutrality and to stop increases in media ownership concentration. It's always Republicans who fight the Democrats on these issues, working in favor of giant corporations and against the best interests of the public.","For those who aren't aware, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) works as follows: There are 5 Commissioners. These 5 people basically, on their own, determine the regulations that dictate how our media system works, including things like how many media companies own the American media, as well as whether or not we will preserve net neutrality. Whenever the FCC votes on new regulations, the majority vote wins.

Each new president essentially gets to determine who will take 3 of those positions, which means that each new president virtually has all of the power to decide the regulations that decide how our media system works for several years thereafter. In effect, if the President is a Republican then the Republicans on the FCC decide our media regulations. If a Democrat is the President, the Democrats on the FCC decide our media regulations.

Over the past 30 or so years, it has always been the Commissioners appointed by Democrats who have fought to do things like stop increases in media ownership concentration and preserve net neutrality. And it has always been the Republicans who have fought against Democrats on these issues.

Right now, the only FCC Commissioner who is truly committed to standing up to save Net Neutrality is the Democrat. There are currently 2 vacancies on the FCC, waiting for appointments, so for the time being there are two Republican Commissioners and one Democrat. Once the appointments go through, there will be 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. But as long as the Republicans have the presidency, the Republicans will hold power in the FCC.

Just thought you'd all like to know.

At a time when privacy has taken a hit from the republicans, and its becoming more and [more clear](http://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/abu-dhabi/privacy-more-important-than-security-interpol-foundation) how important privacy is - I think the tech giants need to be reminded why they should care more.  Please help pressure the tech giants as well, so that they care more about privacy - use competitors services. Every single one of us that does this puts some amount of real pressure on them, every little service we can replace in our daily lives. Even if it doesn't yield immediate political / privacy results it will be better for us as consumers, as they may improve privacy policies and products in response.

e2: sorry about the wording of the title, just to be clear: 

I'm not blaming the tech giants for the ISP law that the republicans just passed. I'm just saying the tech giants could care and do more about it.

I'm not saying this is about ISPs vs tech giants.
