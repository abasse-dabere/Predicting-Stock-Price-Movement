technology,"Comcast's Xfinity Mobile Is Now Throttling Resolution, And Speed. Even UNLIMITED Users. Details Inside.","TLDR: Comcast is now going to throttle your 720p videos to 480p. You'll have to pay extra to stream at 720p again. 
If you pay for UNLIMITED: You now get throttled after 20 gigs, and devices connected to your mobile hotspot cannot exceed 600kbps. If you're paying the gig though, you still get 4G speeds, ironic moneygrab.



Straight from an email I received today:

Update on cellular video resolution and personal hotspots
We wanted to let you know about two changes to your Xfinity Mobile service that'll go into effect in the coming weeks.

Video resolution

To help you conserve data, we've established 480p as the standard resolution for streaming video through cellular data. This can help you save money if you pay By the Gig and take longer to reach the 20 GB threshold if you have the Unlimited data option. 

Later this year, 720p video over cellular data will be available as a fee-based option with your service. In the meantime, you can request it on an interim basis at no charge. Learn more

This update only affects video streaming over cellular data. You can continue to stream HD-quality video over WiFi, including at millions of Xfinity WiFi hotspots.

Personal hotspots

If you have the Unlimited data option, your speeds on any device connected to a personal hotspot will not exceed 600 Kbps. At this speed, you'll conserve data so that it takes longer to reach the 20 GB threshold but you'll still be able to do many of the online activities you enjoy.

Want faster speeds when using a personal hotspot? The By the Gig data option will continue to deliver 4G speeds for all data traffic.",2586,37281,2018-07-02,TECH,0.03478415310382843,0.9313339591026306,0.033881884068250656
