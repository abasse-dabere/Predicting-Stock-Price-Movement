technology,Here's how to contact the FCC with your thoughts on net neutrality.,"**Contact the FCC by phone**:

* 1-888-225-5322 
* press 1, then 4, then 2, then 0
* say that you wish to file comments concerning the FCC Chairman’s plan to end net neutrality

**Or on the web**:

* https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings/express
* Under Proceedings, enter 14-28 and 17-108

**Suggested script**:

It's my understanding that the FCC Chairman intends to reverse net neutrality rules and put big Internet Service Providers in charge of the internet. I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.
