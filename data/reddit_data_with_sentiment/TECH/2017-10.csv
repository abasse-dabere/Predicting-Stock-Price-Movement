technology,"We have less than 24 hours left to get Ajit Pai fired from the FCC, if you can please take the time to message your senators to vote against him","We have till Monday until the Senate decides if Ajit Pai would stay as the chairman or be kicked out of the FCC. If he were to be kicked out, it would show congress that pulling Net Neutrality would be a big mistake for everyone. So please tell your Senators **NOT** to vote for him and tell them that we need Net Neutrality. Heres how you can contact them:

[Fill out a petition and send it to them here!](http://act.freepress.net/call/internet_nn_pai_fire/?source=twitter)

[Alternate site](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-your-senators-fire-ajit-pai-the-fcc-chairman-trying-to-kill-net-neutrality)

[Call and get in contact with Congress and the FCC here!](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?call=1)

* Once you put in your phone number, you will receive a call from FFTF and they will tell you to dial your zip code.
* After you dial your zip code, you will then reach an automatic voice call by your state senator.
* Depending on your senator they might tell you to dial 1 or a different number.
* If you manage to get everything right, you should then have to speak on why you want him to be fired and why you want to keep Net Neutrality. If you don't know what to say, you will get a message on Battle for the Net on what to say to them or you can just make up your own sentences for example like this: 

&gt; Ajit Pai should no longer be the chairman of the FCC because of his corporate stands against everyone in the USA. He was previously a lawyer for Verizon and became a favorite among them because he always looks for loophole in our current laws and finds a way around them. He wants to make the internet more expensive and inaccessible to people living in poor areas. If he continues to be the Chairman then he will do nothing but screw everyone else over while only benefits Comcast and Verzion. I also need the internet to help me with my future careers and for keeping me and my family entertained. 
The internet is a tool that everyone needs to use everyday. He should not be allowed to be part of government because he is only there to hurt everyone instead of supporting them. Every vote for him is a vote against everyone else in America.

technology,The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. This could be the last chance for Internet users to make their voices heard.,"Hey reddit, I wanted to give everyone a heads up that Ajit Pai, former Verizon lawyer and current chairman of the FCC, is expected to circulate the text of his rule and announce a vote to gut net neutrality protections on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving.

**[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22. 

**There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com**

**We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**

Our best shot at saving net neutrality is if we can get phones ringing off the hook in Washington, DC right NOW. It's a long shot, but it's our best shot.

**That means it’s extra important today that Congress gets flooded with phone calls from Internet users telling them to stand up AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon and defend the open Internet.**

**You can call your reps easily with just one click here: [battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

You’ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this: 

&gt;""I support Title Two net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.""

You can also just call this number directly and enter your zipcode to get connected to your legislators: **202-930-8550**

If you run a website, blog, tumblr, or forum, help spread the word by putting up a sticky post, or use one of these widgets, ads, or banners: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join

Ajit Pai is expected to circulate the text of his rule killing net neutrality on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving. Once that happens, it will move to a vote at the FCC’s open meeting in December, and it will become much much harder to stop him. 

**There are key members of Congress considering whether to step in and force Pai to slow down.

Now, Verizon (where FCC Chairman Ajit Pai used to be a top lawyer) [is lobbying](
