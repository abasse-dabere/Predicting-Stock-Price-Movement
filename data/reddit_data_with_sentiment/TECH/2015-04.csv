technology,Hi reddit! We are the Public Relations Department of the largest broadcasting and cable company in the world! Ask Us Anything!,"Hi reddit,

Judging from community response, there is a lot of interest for us to do an AMA here on reddit! 

About our company:

In 1963, Ralph Roberts and his partners, Daniel Aaron and Julian Brodsky, bought American Cable Systems for just $500,000 - we were only a small cable operator at the time. We've grown so much since then, to become the largest broadcasting and cable company in the world by revenue, after we changed to our current name in 1969.

We have a few people on staff who will be responding to this AMA, most of whom with the account /u/Comcast_AMA.

Here is a list of them in no particular order:

-  /u/Comcast_AMA - DC. David Cohen, [VP](/corporate/about/pressroom/corporateoverview/corporateexecutives/davidcohen.html).

-  /u/Comcast_AMA - R. Robert, PR Officer.

Thanks! We really appreciate your support as we continue to actively develop the best possible platform for our valued customers.

P.S. Thanks to the mods for all their help!",287,530,2015-04-01,TECH,0.01408638060092926,0.8849955201148987,0.10091812908649445

Here's what I found:

[Link to Netflix's terms of use](https://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse)

Article 6C

&gt;You may view a movie or TV show through the Netflix service primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such movie or TV show. The content that may be available to watch will vary by geographic location. Netflix will use technologies to verify your geographic location.

Article 6H

&gt;We may terminate or restrict your use of our service, without compensation or notice if you are, or if we suspect that you are (i) in violation of any of these Terms of Use or (ii) engaged in illegal or improper use of the service.

Although this is directed toward changing your location, I did confirm with a Netflix employee via their chat that VPNs in general are against their policy.

&gt;Netflix Efren

&gt;I understand, all I can tell you is Netflix opposes the use of VPNs

***

In short Netflix may terminate your account for the use of a VPN or any location faking.

***

I bring this up, because I know many redditors, including me, use a VPN or application like Hola. Particularly in my case, my ISP throttles Netflix. I have a 85Mbps download speed, but [this is my result](http://i.imgur.com/zOWJAki.png) from testing my connection on Netflix.  I turn on my VPN and whad'ya know [everything is perfect](http://i.imgur.com/qZMCKiT.png). If I didn't have a VPN, I would cancel Netflix there is no way I would put up with the slow speeds and awful quality.I know there's many more reasons to use a VPN, but not reason or not you should have the right to. I think it's important that Netflix amends their policy and you can feel free to let them know how you feel [here](https://help.netflix.com/help). 

I understand Netflix does not have much control over content boundaries, but it doesn't seem many users are aware they can be terminated for faking their location. Content boundaries would need an industry level fix, it's a silly and outdated idea. I wouldn't know where to begin with that.

I don't really have much else to say beyond my anger, but I wanted to bring awareness to this problem. Knowing many redditors using VPNs, many could be affected.",2222,4616,2015-04-06,TECH,0.10212519764900208,0.8757563233375549,0.02211848460137844

technology,"I recently contacted my state Rep David Jolly about Net Neutrality, here is the email to him and his response..","This is what I email (I sent this for my SO for a college assignment)

Dear Representative David Jolly,

I am sending this email to urge you to please allow the newly passed Net Neutrality guidelines to be passed by the US House of Representatives. This agreement is a large step in our country to allow for fair access to the internet. Per a Huffing Post online article, the US is ranked #9 in the world in average broadband speeds, while paying a large premium for these services. Allowing internet providers to charge for higher demand websites should NOT be allowed by the US government. All people who access the internet should be able to do it freely and not have a Telco providers be able to restrict which websites are accessed and placed in internet ""fast lanes"".

Also, pricing has become a huge issue with current internet providers in the US today, per HuffingtonPost.com, Verizon offers FioS service at 500Mbit download speed for 310 dollars/ month, while in Hong Kong, and the price for the SAME speed is only 25 dollars/month. In addition to Hong Kong, in Seoul (The capital of South Korea) they pay $30/month for that same 500Mbit download speed. The question I propose to you, Mr. Representative, is why in the US, it is seemingly ok for companies to price gouge its customers for access to the World Wide Web?

Per the FreePress.net, ""On Feb. 26, the FCC voted to define broadband as what we all know it is — a connection to the outside world that is merely faster than the phone lines we used to use for dial-up access, phone calls and faxes."" Please allow this to take effect, as it will have a profound effect on the future way that Americans access the internet. If this is the ""land of the free"", why should citizens be forced to pay more to visit higher traffic websites?

Also, per the PBS, the American Government was duped into providing up to 200 BILLION (yes, with a B!) in money to the telecommunications companies to gain higher profits while NOT upgrading the current infrastructure. Per PBS' article, ""Over the decade from 1994-2004 the major telephone companies profited from higher phone rates paid by all of us, accelerated depreciation on their networks, and direct tax credits an average of $2,000 per subscriber for which the companies delivered precisely nothing in terms of service to customers. That's $200 billion with nothing to be shown for it."" [By Robert X. Cringely]. This is basically a slap in the face to the Government as well as the citizens, and should not be allowed.

Again, please allow this act to be passed into a bill, so the US may improve its world standing in the broadband internet segment, which will do nothing but help the future of this great country. In the end, Mr. Jolly, I would like feedback on your view to Net Neutrality, as well as your decision as to if you support the new regulations under Title II or not.

#And this is the response from him:

April 6, 2015

Dear Ms. Durig,

Knowing of your interest in the current debate on net neutrality, I wanted to update you on recent actions taken by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which allow the agency to regulate the internet as a Title II telecommunication service, commonly referred to as a ""common carrier.""

On February 26, the FCC voted 3-2 to regulate the internet as a telecommunications utility using a law from 1934. As a Title II common carrier, the internet will be regulated under the Communications Act of 1934, which brings with it onerous regulations that are 81 years old. I strongly disagree with this decision, as it will hamper the innovation of the internet by regulating it as a utility.

The FCC arrived at this decision after prior attempts to regulate the internet failed beneath judicial scrutiny. Both in 2010 and 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down similar regulations, which used clauses under the Title I provisions. Having failed to enforce net neutrality rules under a less regulated Title I information service, the FCC moved to utilize the more restrictive regulatory framework of Title II to accomplish the same objective. Similar to the previous two rulings, this decision is also expected to be mired in judicial proceedings.

Americans have become accustomed to the wealth of information and entertainment that the internet provides them, and rightfully voice their concerns when this status quo becomes threatened. The FCC's most recent ruling establishes regulations that were never meant to be placed upon a service like the internet, using a framework from a time when such a service was inconceivable. We can do better. Congress must insert itself into this debate and create a modern legal structure that preserves the internet as it is and allows for continued innovation in this important sector of our economy.

The creation of the internet sparked a transformative technological revolution- one which our society only gets to witness every hundred years. While we are still in the early stages of developing the internet and utilizing its promise, I am strongly concerned that the FCC's ruling to regulate it as a utility will encumber and stifle further innovative efforts. Such a restriction will restrict the ability to further transform our economy and hamper the efforts to provide access to information for every American. As such, I support the consumer protections offered by the concept of net neutrality, but I only support a net neutrality framework that has been authorized by Congress, not through including the internet in an eight decades old statute which limits its infinite potential by regulating it as a utility.

I am committed to working with my colleagues to evaluate the balanced interests of all sides of this issue and develop a legislative solution that is appropriately tailored to the 21st Century. I have taken the liberty of sharing your thoughts with my colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over legislation dealing with net neutrality. I will be sure to continue to update you on any legislative updates.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact me. It is my hope that you will continue to keep me apprised of your interest in legislative issues important to you. Lastly, please visit my website located at jolly.house.gov and consider signing up for my weekly e-newsletter, which provides updates on issues in Congress.

TL;DR:

Basically, Rep Jolly seems to think the regulations that were passed are outdated for the internet in its current setup, and that it will stifle current improvement and businesses growth.

* To those asking why some sites want an ID: It's to prevent malicious and\or fraudulent changes to information. You can block out the ID number and photo, among other things, but only as long as a name and address is viewable.

* To those asking why this was posted: It's nothing more than useful information to those who want to use it or simply wish to have it on hand. Some people will use it, others won't--it's just an option.

* A supposed employee stating that [they must](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/31u84n/how_to_remove_yourself_from_most_background_check/cq5ff90) delete info and follow through with opt-outs

I'd like to start off by first saying thanks to /u/LawyerCT and /u/Pibbman. They both brought up this topic in their [own](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/j1mit/how_to_remove_yourself_from_all_background_check) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/j0enu/how_to_remove_yourself_from_the_background_check/) on /r/technology, but I noticed that opting out of these sites didn't exactly remove **ALL** of your information.



I decided to follow in Pibbman's steps and work on creating a list of various sites to opt-out of but ultimately it became too much. This is when I originally contacted some friends to help me work on creating this ""Master opt-out list"" which spiraled out of control into an anti-dox guide aimed at Tumblr using the name of [The Paranoid's Bible](http://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/), but I digress.



I'm not here to advertise this project, what I'm here to do is to provide you the opt-outs from our [Master Opt-out List](http://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/post/114108745259/opt-out-master-list) to thank /r/Technology, Reddit and its userbase for helping put me on the path to helping others remove their information.



Below this post will be the Opt-outs in the order they appear in the list. It will hopefully be organized, somewhat.



**Note:** I'm only including the ""Online Opt-outs"" due to the large quantity of links. All of the opt-outs and their instructions can be viewed at the [Master Opt-out List](http://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/post/114108745259/opt-out-master-list) link. I know many who're interested in anti-doxxing\self doxing would rather the entire list of opt-outs be placed here but, again, due to the amount I feel like I'll be spamming.I also am possibly forgetting one or two opt-outs on the online opt-outs, but I'm just dumping these so people are aware these opt-outs exist.

They asked that I add in text from an EFF link that I used to make my case, and said that I could also delete it and resubmit it with the edits due to the post's downtime:

&gt;All signatory countries will be required to conform their domestic laws and policies to the provisions of the Agreement. In the US, this is likely to further entrench controversial aspects of US copyright law (such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act [DMCA]) and restrict the ability of Congress to engage in domestic law reform to meet the evolving IP needs of American citizens and the innovative technology sector. The recently leaked US-proposed IP chapter also includes provisions that appear to go beyond current US law.

The [Trans-Pacific Partnership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership) is a multinational trade agreement that has been negotiated in secret since early 2010.  Representatives of many multinational firms have access to the full text of the TPP; however, politicians have not yet been given access to the full text.  Earlier this week, three senators introduce a bill to ""fast track"" the TPP.  One problem with fast track is that legislators would only be given [88 seconds apiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkOEFPxTN5I) to debate the TPP.  Another is that they'd have a maximum of 90 days total to pass the bill because of the mechanisms used to expedite the legislative process.  Because the bill is over 1000 pages long and because it is not yet fully public (what we do know about it comes from leaks, not announcements or press releases), what fast track would do is prevent the public from seeing the full text, analyzing it, and banding together to defeat it.  Fast track would also prevent opponents such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders from filibustering the bill as it's being rammed down our throats.

These are the issues with fast tracking the TPP.  Here is some more background information on the TPP in general:

**What you can do as an individual**


I've linked to this old thread before, but it's worth doing so again because it is my understanding that this is the best action we can take, as individuals, to affect the decisions of politicians:

* [How to get your senators' and representatives' attention on any issue without being a wealthy donor | Protip from a former Senate intern](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1os8rz/how_to_get_your_senators_and_representatives/)

If you don't feel as though you have the time or writing skills to compose a letter to the editor with which to call out your senators and representatives, then please, at the very least, call their offices to express your opposition to the TPP.

You can find the phone numbers for your senators' offices [here](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) and those for your representatives [here](http://www.house.gov/representatives/).

Also, work to inform others in your immediate peer group by talking about the TPP and ISDS when conversation turns to politics.

**What we can do as a group**

Let's start talking about direct actions that can be taken in real life to coordinate our opposition to the TPP.  Obviously, most people with full time jobs can't realistically drop everything and protest 7 days a week.  But why don't we pick a day--perhaps Saturday--and have weekly rallies around the country?

Feel free to amend these ideas or come up with your own, but here are some ideas that I've come up with so far:

* Coordinating online activism through /r/politics, /r/technology, /r/evolutionreddit, and a sub I recently created: /r/FlushTheTPP.

* Coordinating marches in DC every Saturday from the Capitol to the White House.

* Holding rallies every Saturday in major cities and capitols around the country.

* Organizing encampments full of labor union workers and other TPP opponents outside of senators' and representatives' private residences and state offices.  Film everything and refuse to leave until the TPP has been defeated.

technology,Sony emails prove that Sony/MPAA are actively lobbying governments to push the TPP/TTIP and are even helping to create 'criminal enforcement strategies' to enforce the draconian copyright laws.,"Today I stumbled across a post concerning the Sony email leaks that seemed too important to ignore, it contained the two following images.

&gt;http://imgur.com/a/tjzgT

These two images are absolute concrete proof that Sony/MPAA are lobbying governments to push the TPP/TTIP's extensive copyright laws. One part reads, 
&gt;""Finally, in regards to trade, the MPAA/MPA with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-IP trade policies such as TPP and the proposed EU/US trade agreement (TTIP)""

This here is concrete proof that corporations globally are pushing laws for their own profit at the expense of the people, this will be basically SOPA/CISPA on steroids. 

But wait there's more, they even said that they have formed an,
&gt;""MPAA/Studio working group to study and develop the next generation of criminal enforcement strategies to present to federal prosecutors"".

This is worse than we thought /r/technology, not only have the MPAA influenced and crafted some of the strictest copyright laws in the history of the internet for its own gain, they have been put in charge of implementing the punishments for breaking these laws.

This whole deal is completely beyond repair and needs to be shot down, but with the majority of the world economy on board, it seems like it will be a difficult task.

Bare in mind that the TPP not only includes copyright, but it will allow corporations to [sue governments](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/3/26/headlines/wikileaks_reveals_tpp_proposal_allowing_corporations_to_sue_nations) for 'cutting into their future profits' and to get the countries to repeal laws like environmental and food safety standards to maximise profits. As seen on wikileaks about the TPP:
&gt;...WikiLeaks has released the ""Investment Chapter,"" which highlights the intent of U.S.-led negotiators to create a tribunal where corporations can sue governments if their laws interfere with a company’s claimed future profits.

And as I'm sure it's a sensitive topic of discussion right now, the UK will likely lose the NHS as well since this also allows US pharmaceutical companies to sue governments.

For those who don't know about the TPP/TTIP, they are trade agreements between major world powers that are currently being negotiated in complete secrecy with corporations playing a big role. We only know most of what we do because of wikileaks: 

&gt;https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership
&gt;https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership
&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnC1mqyAXmw

It's also being [fastracked through congress](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/american-congress-reaches-agreement-fast-track-trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-1496853) so we don't have much time to stop it. 

Do WHATEVER you can to help raise awareness about this, this is a life or death situation for the internet and most of modern society. Call your representatives. Send it to your family and friends. Post it on social media. Show your dog.
&gt;https://stop-ttip.org/

We need to do absolutely everything we can to stop this monster of a treaty from taking the internet out of the hands of the people completely. Also, try to help organise efforts against it, we need all the help we can get.


Edit: thank you /u/jamescolespardon on /r/worldpolitics for [finding this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/335611/tpp_the_dirtiest_trade_deal_youve_never_heard_of/cqi070l):

&gt;[Here](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-114hr1890ih/pdf/BILLS-114hr1890ih.pdf) is a link to the 114 page, bipartisan, bicameral draft of legislation by former Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan, which would establish fast track status for this type of agreement. It was introduced two days ago. You may not have heard of it because Star Wars released a trailer for a movie in 2016. Or that Australia stopped an alleged ISIS plot. Or ISIL beheaded more people (did you watch the video yet? It's only 29 minutes... And you can skip to ~24:30 for the good stuff), or something something Hilary Clinton.

&gt;[Here](http://csis.org/files/publication/141223_Green_Pivot_Web.pdf) is a link to Pivot 2.0, a paper put out in January for the Center For Strategic &amp; International Studies, a Washington, DC based Think Tank with extremely notable members on their board and as trustees, including the CEOs for major defense contractors and other multinational corporations, as well as former high ranking members of the US Government, including Dick Army (my favorite name, by far, I mean come on!), Richard Armitage, and Henry Kissinger.

&gt;The first chapter is dedicated to the TTP/TTIP trade agreements, with a deadline of June of this year.

&gt;And Paul Ryan's bill will make it one step closer to reality.

&gt;So - let's see who votes for this bill. And who reads it.

&gt;...anyone want to read it with me?

By the way, before Sony or something tries to get me to remove this, I did NOT hack the emails (I don't even have the slightest clue on how to do that, find the real hacker, not me :)), so I am not responsible for these images, I simply found them are am relaying the message to reddit because it is INCREDIBLY important. If I didn't do it, someone else would have, these laws are incredibly immoral and need to have a proper public review. I do not condone hacking at all, but these emails are proof that Sony/MPAA are involved in something more sinister than hacking.

I've just put together and organised information that is practically freely available on the internet, I cannot be sued :) Speak to the mods/admins if you have a problem.

technology,This just went out to all Time Warner employees. Merger is not going through!,"I wanted to tell you personally that, moments ago, we formally and mutually agreed with Comcast to terminate our planned merger. I’m disappointed we were unable to consummate the deal, which we believed would have created great value for customers, colleagues and shareholders alike. 

But I’m also incredibly excited about our future.

When I began my tenure as CEO in January 2014, I committed to three things: making TWC a truly great company, delivering outstanding customer experiences, and maximizing shareholder value. I remain equally committed to those same three goals today. I am proud to say that during the past 16 months, we have greatly improved our Company’s operating results and the quality of our customers’ experiences. Those, in turn, are the essential underpinnings of long-term shareholder value. Today we are well positioned, thanks in part to the substantial investments we have made in our network and customer service, but most of all due to your hard work.

So now what happens? We continue to do what we do best: working together to serve every one of our 15 million customers better every day. We continue to invest to make our network and our products even more competitive. And we continue our commitment to making Time Warner Cable a great place to work for our 55,000 employees.

I am truly sorry for how the uncertainty of the past 14 months has affected each of you – I know it’s been difficult to make decisions about your careers and your lives. There will likely be some continued distractions in the coming weeks as we adjust to our new normal. However, you’ve already demonstrated a remarkable ability to serve our customers well and deliver results through it all.

Now is our time. Together, we will continue to prove that Time Warner Cable can and will create value for our customers, shareholders, each other and the communities we serve. I’m proud to stand alongside you and lead the way forward.

gadgets,"Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon: Nobody is really ""nailing it"".","TL;DR: Apple needs better web services, Google needs better Nexus hardware, Microsoft needs to make a regular laptop and a flagship Windows phone, and Amazon needs more than can fit in a TL;DR.

As we slide into the ""wearables"" age of smartwatches, etc., we get an increasing amount of benefit from choosing a single tech ecosystem of hardware, software, and web services, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon (if you're feeling generous) are the 4 companies providing the closest approximations to complete tech ecosystems. 

Let's start with Apple.  If you buy into the Apple ecosystem, you're getting: 

* top-notch hardware design
* non-fragmented software updates that come from a single source
* the promise of a tightly-integrated iCloud-based software suite that will ""just work"" across all of your Apple devices
* dedicated Apple stores that make returns and troubleshooting vastly easier in many instances
* An established OS for both desktop and mobile that has broad software support.

So all seems well in Appleland, provided you're willing to pony up for the experience.  And in fact all is well, as long as you stay within Appleland.  The major knock I have against Apple is that the moment you need to access Appleland through a non-Apple device, you're forced to use iCloud.com, and that is a very subpar experience.  Allow me to enumerate:

* email has no threaded conversation view.
* does not give you access to Messages.
* does not give you access to your iCloud keychain entries.
* Reminders lack location-based notifications
* does not have access to Apple Maps
* slow animations and outmoded design

What these and other cons amount to is that you cannot access all of Appleland from a non-Apple device.  For many this is not a big deal, but for myself and many others it's a major annoyance and the major reason I don't commit to the Apple ecosystem completely.

Let's move on to Google, and in particular contrast them to Apple. As I see it, the main pro to Google in contrast to Apple is the excellence of their web services.  Gmail, Google Voice, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Now, etc. are all truly exemplary web services that work perfectly both online and on Android.  Google also does a fairly admirable job of putting apps on iOS (they are often not perfect, but surprisingly decent and only limited by their lack of access to core hardware such as NFC for Google Wallet and Siri controls, for example).  If you use primarily web services and want them to work across many devices, Google may work just fine for all your needs.  So where does Google have room for improvement?  

* While Chrome OS is interesting, it is relatively new, and if you need to do any professional work that involves things like music/video creation/editing, coding, etc., Chrome OS does not allow for this and therefore you must go elsewhere and Google cannot provide you with an all-inclusive ecosystem.
* Google has yet to provide an all-around excellent hardware solution on par with Apple.  They have released the Chromebook Pixel 2, which by all accounts is excellent if your needs are served by it, but there is no Nexus phone that has been able to go head-to-head with what the iPhone can offer.  Prior to the Nexus 6, Nexus phones have never aimed at the high end of the market, and you had to make sacrifices in areas like camera quality and overall build quality if you wanted the pure Google experience.  With the Nexus 6, while Google made a step in the right direction with the camera and build quality, the screen size is automatically going to not make it for everyone, and it lacks a fingerprint scanner.  If Google can release a Nexus 5 this year with an excellent camera, build quality, fingerprint scanner, etc., then that will be most welcome, but so far every Nexus has been an exercise in compromise and frustration for many users.  Google is not a large-scale hardware making like Apple, and it shows in their failure to establish a Nexus program that gives uncompromising excellence in hardware and software for all the way that the iPhone is able to.  

Considering the negatives listed above for Apple and Google, Microsoft actually finds itself in a very interesting position.  Microsoft has an established desktop OS on which real work can be done, a suite of web services that work very well like Google's, and the ability to make  hardware with excellent build quality (Surface).  Microsoft is showing many signed of improvement, and I'll be very interested to see how Windows 10 pans out for them.  They lag far behind in the adoption and 3rd-party support for their mobile platform, but by all accounts Window Phone is actually a solid platform and there aren't any serious flaws with it other than lack or market share which drives lack of software support.  Also, the Surface is an interesting idea but cannot appeal to everyone.  Personally I find the Surface concept to be a bad idea.  I don't want to awkwardly touch my laptop screen, and I don't want a half-baked keyboard and trackpad.  In my opinion, Microsoft really needs to make a Macbook Air competitor: a laptop with excellent build quality with tightly integrated software support and zero bloatware.  That, combined with a first-party flagship Windows Phone, might actually make me consider Microsoft's ecosystem.  There is potential for Microsoft to give us software, hardware, and web services integration in ways that no other company is able, but as of now they're just not there yet...

Amazon is an interesting case, because Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the backbone of so many of the web services that we use (Netflix for example), so there is enormous web services potential within Amazon as a company.  However, Amazon does not have a desktop OS and their attempt at a smartphone was disappointing.  I don't really consider Amazon to be a serious contender in the ecosystem war, but they are an interesting company to follow and I look forward to what they might do in the next 10 years.  

That was certainly a long post.  If you made it this far, thanks for sticking with me.  If you're interested in what I do, I'm a Google services user with all-Apple hardware and a Windows work computer, hoping that someday I'll be able to commit to one of these ecosystems without compromise.
