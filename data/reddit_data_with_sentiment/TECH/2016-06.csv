technology,TeamViewer has been hacked. They are denying everything and pointing fingers at the users.,"TeamViewer has yet to leave a comment ~~on the issue~~ that's not in complete denial of the problem.  

Update: /u/TeamViewerOfficial has reached out.  Posted [here in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4m7ay6/teamviewer_has_been_hacked_they_are_denying/d3ufp8e), and sent a PM with [this post here in /r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4md95j/teamviewer_launches_trusted_devices_and_data/) ([and one at /r/teamviewer](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mcvp4/teamviewer_launches_trusted_devices_and_data/)). They also [announced an open letter to users](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer/status/738725855959101440) on Twitter ([archived here](http://archive.is/jED6k)). Link to the open letter [here](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/teamviewer-launches-trusted-devices-and-data-integrity/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=social%20&amp;utm_content=trusteddevices/dataintegrity&amp;utm_campaign=Social) ([archived here](http://archive.is/Githe)). Right now it looks like they are trying to mitigate the problem with a band-aid, excuses and new features.  

**Update 2016-06-06 (10th):** Got this in a PM from a user:    
&gt;They just admitted the basis for their assumption of password reuse. If your email address comes up on haveibeenpwned, they simply and blindly assume that you reuse passwords and that is the only possible reason your account is compromised.  
[In reply to a /r/teamviewer comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mq9a5/badly_worded_sentence_or_can_teamviewer_see_our/d3xu3gc) they seem to be admitting this.  

Right now, we still don't know how the unknown party have accessed the clients, even though it's been 4 days since the creation of this post.  
*****

Users are reporting breaches, and thousands of dollars have been stolen with the client, all over /r/teamviewer and at their [support Twitter account](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer_help/with_replies). TV is blaming users with reusing passwords, [yet users with 2FA](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m4a5n/psa_2factorauthentication_use_it/d3snp7k) and [unique very long generated passwords](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4jr9qn/hacked_trough_teamviewer_1800_spent_on_paypal/d3a5tcf) were hacked.  

Some also suggest that [their DNS servers were hijacked and the clients believed the fake server](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m3izy/teamviewer_dns_issues/), being the method of the attack.  

One of the main problems are that they are not taking responsibility: (quoted from /u/rich-uk)  
&gt;Teamviewer is being used as a vector of attack. This has happened on other sites where they had no critical information and within 48 hours everyone's logged in sessions were logged out, an email went round saying you had to click the link in the email (to verify ownership) and set up two factor auth as they knew they were being targeted.
Teamviewer must know they are being targeted, and the stakes are high as the software allows complete access to a trusted machine - it's basically a master key - and there hasn't been a single response with teeth from teamviewer.

Some info by /u/re1jo on the auth protocol [here shows that no password or 2FA would protect your machines](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4m7ay6/teamviewer_has_been_hacked_they_are_denying/d3ucnxk) (based on TV7, may have changed in never versions).  
/u/swatspyder also [found out that](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mbx7h/my_theory_on_the_teamviewer_contact_requests_that/) The TV Management Console page had a flaw that leaked users' names and their existences, may be fixed now. Also:  
&gt;TeamViewer has only stated that the DDoS attack on their DNS infrastructure is unrelated to concerns about their user database being hacked: [Statement on Service Outage](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/statement-on-service-outage/)
They have NOT specifically denied that their user database has been compromised.

I complained to the company itself and got nowhere, they were sorry but they couldn't offer anything higher than the 450 plan. Since they weren't any help, I took 5 minutes to write a complaint to the FCC. All I wrote in the description (along with my information) was, ""Data caps are unreasonable and unlawful."" Within two days, I got an email from my service provider saying that they had received the complaint and could offer me unlimited data for just $10 more a month.

Microsoft's push to upgrade users to Windows 10 [has](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mcdon/i_live_in_the_central_african_bush_we_pay_for/) - [been](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mi2yf/forced_windows_10_upgrade_shuts_down_pc_used_by/) - [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4moycq/credibility_and_trust_microsoft_blows_it_by/) - [hot](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mkp6z/microsoft_accused_of_making_windows_10_impossible/) - [topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mskpc/microsoft_has_resorted_to_malwarelike_tactics/) lately, and since /r/technology has been saturated with such posts in the last few days, a megathread for this discussion is warranted.

#Short summary

Microsoft has used increasingly aggressive tactics to ensure that users of consumer editions of Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 upgrade to their newest Windows 10 platform. As a result, users have mistakenly been upgraded to Windows 10, often without their knowledge or consent. While the free upgrade has worked well for some, other people have reported varying degrees of frustration with the upgrade, such as broken applications, slower performance, decreased usability, and privacy issues.

technology,Amazon Assistant = Spyware! AVOID!,"PSA: Soo... Amazon's super handy ""Add to Wishlist"" option? Love it. Use it all the time to add items from 3rd party websites to my wishlist which is really handy for consolidation. (99% of things are still from Amazon direct, but there are things they don't carry, or other places carry cheaper (more rarely), so still useful.) That's going away at the end of July. It was nice, because it was a very simple Javascript that sent the relevant info about the item in question to Amazon's back end server, and presto, it's on your list. Then it's job is done.

NOW, Amazon is phasing it out, in favor their shiny new ""Amazon Assistant"", which is a full-blown plugin for your browser, rather than a simple bookmark-triggered Javascript. Why, you may wonder? So it can monitor ALL of your surfing, of course, not simply add items to your wishlist. No, really. You read that right. They're literally logging every website you visit and what you do there.

Read the TOS. My recommendation is to pass on it (obviously?). They TRY to make big deal about being careful with data collection, and not tying it directly to your Amazon account, but don't kid yourself. You install this, you give Amazon the right to track EVERY WEBSITE YOU VISIT whether you are shopping or not, and whether it has anything to do with your wishlist or not. But don't worry, they're not associating it wit your Amazon account. Just your IP address and all sorts of other information that they COULD use at anytime. (It's trivial to match up their own records, after all) Or pass onto someone else. (like a vaguely referenced ""affiliate"") Bad form, Amazon. Bad form.

""Automatic Information: The Amazon Assistant may also collect information about the websites you view when you are not interacting with the Amazon Assistant, but we do not associate that information with your Amazon account or identify it with you except as required by law. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include a subset of your IP address; a domain name or full URL of the Web page you are visiting and any referring URL’s to the visited web page; general information about the visited web page, such as product search query or specifications; general information about your browser; general information about your computer's operating system; other identifying alphanumerical information enabling Amazon to identify your computer; and the date and time the above information is logged.""

It's almost easier to use my 4G to stream at this point as my wifi (5 bars) takes forever to play video. 

Literally 15 minutes ago I got passed watching a video start to buffer at an obscenely slow rate... talking 5 minutes of buffer for 5 Seconds of play time....

This is the last straw for me... been dealing with this shit for months, so I put my phone down (still buffering) and pull out my laptop. ... go to speedtest.net and I shit you not, the literal second I hit their website my phone buffers the remaining 23 minutes of video INSTANTLY, assuming it's fluke or coincidence, I try loading different videos... all run instantly. ..not buffer at all....

technology,"TIL that someone can change your Facebook email, password, and two step verification just by asking Facebook to turn off login approvals, and sending in a fake ID. (Happened to me lost all my business pages)","Here is a link to a screenshot of it happening: http://imgur.com/a/L0pTI

I'm obviously pretty devastated as that's a lot of years and money down the drain.

Edit: Also, just to prove this actually happened, you can visit the url in the screenshots for viewing the support ticket and it should show the exact conversation. The hacker also sent my fiance a picture of his genitals, at this point it's blatant harassment.

Edit: I would fly to their office if I could, but they don't allow visits that way. I also tried calling their publicly listed phone number, and it referred me to the help section on their website. I'm trying to communicate through the help section forms, but I keep getting different people, and they all keep referring me to the help section. Which I then go to, and submit the form, and get another person that refers me to the help section. Infinite loop.

Edit: u/lucozad3 informed me of this: ""FYI the attachment contains an imgur identification code, meaning anyone can look at your screenshots and find the fake id that the hacker used, here it is: (I was told by a reddit user that having this imgur link here could have this post removed because it displays personal information even though it's a fake ID, so I'm removing that for now)

You might not be worried about this but if the fake ID contains your personal information, like birthday and photo, you might be making yourself a further target.""

The ID isn't me it's a random black guy with my name, all other information is wrong, such as the birthday, etc, I don't even own a passport, and the passport that they used wasn't even signed 

Edit: I have the emails the hacker use to communicate with Facebook, but I'm unsure if I should post them here.

Edit: As requested I've added the link to me tweeting Facebook: https://twitter.com/yhuthere/status/747767804292530176

Edit: I am black, me referencing that it was a random black guy, was to say that's the only thing that I and the man in the fake passport have in common, all other information is different.

Edit: Since this keeps on being asked, the hacker didn't have access to my email or password, they just said they no longer had access to my phone number or email, and facebook allowed them to choose the email to lodge the support ticket from. The support ticket in the screenshot is them emailing facebook support from the email the hacker chose

Edit: Facebook just removed the hacked account from Facebook, but there's no news on the business pages yet. 

Edit: I just received contact from a Facebook employee informing they've secured the pages and account, and are working to restore access

Edit: We're just waiting on Facebook to restore access to the pages, I gave her an exact link to the pages that are still missing hope to hear updates soon. 

Edit: Facebook has restored a few more pages, there are 5 still missing, also upvotes are disappearing from this post which I find weird but thanks reddit, I don't know what would have happened without you

Edit: All but two pages have been returned, I'm expecting they will be back soon. 

Edit: Facebook returned each and every business page, and gave the Facebook account back. They really saved the day. I am going to see if there are anyways they can help me reveal the hackers, or pursue them through legal means, since they impersonated me and stole from my business. The power of social media is real, and even though this happened Facebook is still my favorite company on earth, I built my businesses and met my future wife all on Facebook. Thanks reddit!

Edit: I wanted to add my thoughts on a possible solution, as a final edit to this post. This hacker was able to submit this request and hack the profile in 4 hours, all while I was sleeping. I didn't even have time to see that someone was requesting this, there was no notification on Facebook, no notification on my cell phone, there was a notification in my email account, but it's not an email account I check daily. Given the severity of the theft of information if someone where to hack into your account, I think Facebook should freeze the account to see if the owner does eventually use the original email, or phone number to get back into the account. I'd say the account should be frozen for at least 30 days before they allow photo ID to be accepted. Yes this may annoy some people who actually lost access, but they can likely get access to their phone number or email faster than 30 days. Plus Facebook has post blocks that are 30 days so it's not like it's an unreasonable time span. I think this rule should also be applied to any request to turn off two step verification. Maybe even a text message/email should go out asking if it's you if that's requested. If the request is from a suspicious IP that seems unrelated with the normal IP of the account, it shouldn't be accepted. Allowing users to willingly file a copy of their ID (with blurred info) with Facebook in case of these sort of situations is an idea as well, so when something like this happens, the user has to respond with the ID they previously filed. Also, if trusted friends is added on the account, I feel like they should accept that over ID to verify identity. Just my 4am thoughts, going back to sleep. Thank you all.",1837,7083,2016-06-28,TECH,0.09259120933711529,0.8764965832233429,0.030912207439541817
