technology,Since so many people are plagued/affected-workflow by bad OS updates by Microsoft here's a friendly reminder,"Have a live usb version of Ubuntu/fedora or any linux distro for that matter.    
Most likely you can get the files you need out for the moment and continue working on another system if you have access.     
Plus for small editing works a Live Usb works magic, you can connect to the internet as well!   


I'd always encourage a dual partition tho. Much easier.   
And you always have a backup OS in case things go bad.

technology,"We need to make it clear to the FCC that we want uncapped Internet access, for innovation in an increasingly data dependent world and user protection.","Comcast's data cap policy is a flawed consumer control measure against those who would go without cable and a direct action against companies that have actually innovated over the past decade rather than sit pretty on a monopoly. 

**Why this is flawed:**


**There is no guarantee of accuracy or transparency:**

Regardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received [thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement](https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-FCC-Has-Received-13000-Complaints-About-Comcast-Data-Caps-135895).  Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth. 

**Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:** 

Data caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example [Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.

This isn't just for videos of course, people who use services like Steam will be hit just as hard especially as the size of games increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.  

**Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:**

The Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.

In any thread regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (""Save us Google Fiber!""). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment. 


**What we need to do:**

How do consumers collectively fight this when they have little recourse in their choice of ISP?
The FCC is currently investigating data caps as a practice. If we as consumers just accept data caps the FCC will have less reason to crack down so it is imperative that the public puts pressure on the FCC. We're back to the Net Neutrality fight all over again as data caps are just a proxy issue that allows Comcast to achieve the same thing it wanted with its draconian net neutrality rules. 

Some users may be currently exempt from data caps but this behavior will absolutely roll down hill to other ISPs once they realize that consumers will accept it. Then you'll have to deal with your own little small town version of Comcast with little recourse. 

Much like the behavior of the last Net Neutrality fight calling the FCC directly has a huge impact. 

FCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322

[If you can't call directly you can file an online form to register your complaint.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)

Like before we need to raise public awareness of this issue and flood the FCC with our complaints and input so we don't have to deal with a stifled internet. 

**EDIT 1:**
Some users have mentioned that the online forum and phone line isn't working out for them.
Another number that you can use to submit a comment or complaint.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000

This was also a number we used to contact in order to urge Tom Wheeler to stand for Net Neutrality once again we can call and urge Mr. Wheeler to stand with the internet once again. However please remember that there are real people on the other side of the line. 



**EDIT 2:**

**If you so choose to give the office of Tom Wheeler((202) 418-1000) or the FCC complaint line(1-888-225-5322) a call here's a handy script you can use. Feel free to add on or improvise on this:**

""I'm calling FCC Chairman Wheeler to urge him to stand with Internet users and pass strong, loophole-free rules against so called Data Caps. There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself [admitted](https://gizmodo.com/comcast-will-cap-more-peoples-data-because-of-fairness-1740913276) in [internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren’t about network congestion](https://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg). Instead, it claims these data caps are about “fairness,” but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there’s no argument that these caps are based on any “fair” costs that Internet usage causes. The real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast’s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to “cut the cord” even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. ""

Replace Comcast with your own local ISP or ISPs in general. 

*Script and sources shamelessly lifted from [Battleforthenet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?title-x-committees=1#top).


**EDIT 3:**

The key to this fight will sadly not be a single set of calls made to the FCC but rather a sustained campaign of public pressure and complaint. Long after this thread's karma decays and it falls off the pages people still need let their voices be heard. There will be more threads in the future to bring attention to this we wont go down without a fight.

technology,"Here's the stupidest thing yet that a politician has said about the mass DDoS attacks that took down ""the internet""","Ever since the mass DDoS attacks yesterday that took down ""the Internet,"" I've been trying to keep track of all the blatantly incorrect, misleading, fear mongering statements that members of Congress and other officials have made. (Disclosure: I work for [a nonprofit](fightforthefuture.org) that fights bad Internet legislation like CISA.)

It's been tough to choose, but there's one that stands out as the most ridiculous:

Tennessee's Representative Marsha Blackburn [went on CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-yJbac48m4&amp;feature=youtu.be) shortly after the attacks and implied that the Internet outage could have been prevented by a bill called SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, which you may remember because it was resoundingly rejected after [mass protests](https://www.sopastrike.com/numbers/) as TERRIBLE idea that would have lead to widespread internet censorship. It also had absolutely *nothing* to do with preventing cyber attacks. Even its proponents would agree that it was about copyright enforcement, not digital security. It certainly did nothing to hold companies accountable for improving the security of consumer technology products, which is what [actually would](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/double-dip-internet-of-things-botnet-attack-felt-across-the-internet/) prevent attacks like this.

Blackburn went on to blame free speech advocates for having stopped SOPA, and even went so far as to call us ... wait for it ... CYBERBOTS!!!

Do you care about free speech? If so, you're a cyberbot too. Cyberbots unite! Let's remember that many politicians barely understand how the Internet works. We can't let them exploit these recent attacks to push for bad legislation.
