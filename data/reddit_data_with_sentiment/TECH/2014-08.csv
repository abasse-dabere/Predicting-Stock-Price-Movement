gadgets,Looking for a quality multi tool. Maybe something specialized for IT work.,"I'm having terrible luck finding a quality multi tool. Probably because I'm cheap. My current tool is falling apart. 

I mainly use it in the office, working on laptops and such. At the moment, the blade and the pliers are the only useful parts. The screw driver attachments have always sucked.

My biggest complaint about the tool, though, is the fact that the various tools don't lock in place. If I try to use the screw drivers, they fold in every time.

Any suggestion would be welcomed. I am going to buy a complete tool kit, but, I'd like a multi purpose tool for when I need to go desk side.

Edit: Thank you for all of the suggestions. I ordered a complete kit as well as a multi tool. I settled on this one. http://tinyurl.com/mgva2px

technology,Facebook has become a serious threat to our privacy. It is time we show them we are not okay with this. Join me in a mass deletion.,"I am of the opinion sites like this should never be allowed to blatantly collect, store, and sell personal information on such a massive scale, and I have made the decision to leave Facebook by permanently deleting my account today. We have seen headline after headline documenting the sites abuses and invasions of our privacy, and the worst part of this is, we have chosen to let them get away with this for years. If you believe the same, join me in leaving them for good.

In order to start the deletion process, google 'how to permanently delete a Facebook account' (i would post a facebook link but it is against subreddit rules). keep in mind, this is not deactivation, this is deletion. The process involves a 30 day confirmation period, during which your account will still appear deleted, but you will have time to change your mind. You may also request a download of your Facebook information.

UPDATE:

In response to /u/Microphone926 's question, here are some exaples of the abuses I have talked about.

Most recently, probably still on the front page, was a story about the new mandatory mobile messenger service and all the abilities you have to give it in order to use it, things like storing identitiy information, calling and texting others on your behalf, being able to change your internet connection status, etc.

But while this is already quite disturbing, Facebook has been collecting and providing various law enforcement agencies with any data about you thet request. http://news.softpedia.com/news/Facebook-More-Willing-to-Cooperate-with-Law-Enforcement-Agencies-than-Twitter-137723.shtml

Another good example is how efficienly Facebook acts as a people search engine, If i wanted to find information on someone that I intended to harm or harrass in any way, it is very easy to create a profile based on their facebook account, you have pictures, freinds, family, location data, political views, favorite restuarants, emails and contact info, etc.

Also, if you have ever posted anything that a job interviewer or potential employer disagrees with, you can forget about you chances of getting hired by them.

-------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 2:

As mentioned to me in the comments by /u/-moose- , this AMA contains a comment that cites dozens of examples of facebooks invasions of privacy with citations.

It's especially frustrating with rap albums where every song's contributing artists are different and one album becomes sorted into 10 different artists.  Is there an mp3 app that sorts artists strictly by the album artist?  It seems counter-intuitive to do otherwise but I don't know why these developers can't figure out this simple thing.

EDIT: I found an app called GoneMad Music Player.  There is a free trial so it loses points for costing money but it is extremely fast on my 2 year old phone and has a great UI and sorts by album artist like it's supposed to.  Thanks for the suggestions.  I'll look into all of them at some point.

EDIT 2: So many answers here are just people saying what app they use.  I have tried most of the ones you are mentioning and they do not sort albums in the correct manner that I am asking about.  Please read the question before responding.

technology,Re: Comcast - My drafted letter to my state's representatives regarding consumer protection against large cable/internet providers.,"Hi folks, I just finished drafting a letter that I intend to send to my elected state representatives in Congress. The letter addresses the recent influx in publicized customer service complaints against Comcast and calls for political intervention on the matter. 

I wanted to get your opinions on the letter itself before I send it out to make sure I have covered all the important points and properly articulated the need for better consumer protection against such unethical practices. And hey, if you like my letter, you are more than welcome to copy it and send it out to your own members of Congress (just remember to swap out the placeholders).

Anyway, here's my draft. Let me know what you all think.


-------------------------------------------------------


Dear [congressman]:

I am writing on the behalf of millions of fellow [state] residents who currently subscribe to large cable/internet service providers like Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon FiOS and others. This message specifically addresses Comcast, a company who, in recent weeks, has been the subject of numerous outrageous customer service complaints. My purpose in writing to you is to raise awareness and concern regarding how such large companies mistreat their contracted subscribers in a market that offers very little choice or competition throughout the state.

I am sure you have heard of last month's highly-publicized ""call from Hell"" in which a Comcast customer service representative resisted a calling subscriber's request to cancel his service for nearly 20 minutes:  
http://gawker.com/hellish-comcast-call-sets-new-standard-for-shitty-custo-1605200994

Since then, two more stories have come out accusing Comcast of invalid service charges. This one documents a subscriber who was charged over $180 for a service call he had been told would be free of charge. When the subscriber followed up to have the charges reversed, the company representative refused to do so until the subscriber played back a recording of his original call in which he was told the service call would be free. 
http://consumerist.com/2014/08/10/comcast-tells-customer-the-only-reason-hes-getting-bogus-charges-refunded-is-because-he-recorded-call/

This most recent story, probably the worst of the three, claims a Comcast subscriber is now facing $360 in ""unreturned equipment"" fees despite presenting irrefutable evidence that the subscriber did in fact return his equipment to the company on time:
http://www.buzzfeed.com/dannfuria/definitive-proof-it-is-impossible-to-avoid-comcast-wji6
http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/

As a resident who pays good money for television and internet service, the sudden influx of such complaints against the company are very alarming to me. Cable companies have long been notorious for operating a near-monopolistic market, as well as putting priority on maximizing profits over customer satisfaction. When such companies lock their subscribers into multi-year service contracts that they cant escape without paying outrageous early termination fees, it leaves the consumers vulnerable to abusive and unethical practices like those documented above. Many subscribers cannot afford to pay fraudulent charges to their cable company, let alone afford an attorney to contest the charges in court.

What is worse, is that Comcast is apparently able to get away with such practices with very little repercussion. The negative media coverage of last month's 20-minute ""call from Hell"" seems to have had no impact on the quality of Comcast's customer service, despite promises of improvement from their public relations department. After all, when you are the only company servicing a specific area, bad publicity tends to have no affect on your hold of the market. Allowing companies like these to commit such unethical (and borderline-illegal) actions against their own customers, almost completely unpunished, sets a very bad precedent in a market that already heavily favors the companies over the consumers.

[Congressman], the bottom line is, the people of [state], and the rest of the United States, need better protection from cable/internet providers who dominate the market. Comcast and other companies like them should not be allowed to abuse, neglect, or defraud their own subscribers under the protection of lopsided service contracts and lack of direct competition. I am asking my representatives in Congress to investigate the claims against Comcast listed above, and to collectively take firm action to better protect U.S. citizens who feel they are at the mercy of these large, powerful cable/internet providers. Your response to this issue will affect how I vote in the upcoming elections, so I strongly urge you and your colleagues to take a stand and back the people that elected you.

Thank you very much for your time and I look forward to your response.",6.0,9,2014-08-14,TECH,0.2621842920780182,0.7150530815124512,0.022762687876820564

technology,Comcast’s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,"*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “Unreturned” equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast’s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast’s fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible &amp; overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, &amp; International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  

But believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls.",2253.0,7787,2014-08-18,TECH,0.12429914623498917,0.8536036908626556,0.022097164765000343

Currently I am using an Arcam receiver in my media room and only have that room wired for sound.  I am looking to put speakers in the ceiling of the main room of my house, the screened in porch and my master bedroom.

The master bedroom is 18x18 (324 sq ft)
The west porch is 14x25 (350 sq ft)
The main room is around 1500 sq ft and is mostly rectangular except for the entryway.

I am also planning on upgrading my receiver now because I need more HDMI inputs and multi zoning.

My budget for the receiver is &lt; $2000.
The budget for all of the speakers would be &lt;$8000.

Any advice on a receiver to pursue?
Also, how many speakers do you think I need for each room and what would be a good in ceiling speaker for that budget?

Thanks in advance.",7.0,9,2014-08-25,TECH,0.019610224291682243,0.9330912828445435,0.047298554331064224

I would dump a video file onto this, hand it off the the consumer, and it would simply play their video file when plugged in into their TV. The idea would be that these devices are cheap, so we can give them to the consumer permanently.

Why do this? I want to distribute HD video, but most people don't have BluRay players, despite having HDTVs. I can do digital downloads, but then it lives on the computer, not on the TV where it should be viewed.
