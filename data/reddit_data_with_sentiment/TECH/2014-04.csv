Hello /r/technology!

A few days ago it came to the attention of some of the moderators of /r/technology that certain other moderators of the team who are no longer with us had, over the course of many months, implemented several AutoModerator conditions that we, and a large portion of the community, found to be far too broad in scope for their purpose. 

The primary condition which /u/creq [alerted everyone to a few days ago](https://pay.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/) was the ""Bad title"" condition, which made AutoModerator remove every post with a title that contained any of the following:

&gt;#title: [""cake day"", ""cakeday"", ""any love"", ""some love"", ""breaking"", ""petition"", ""Manning"", ""Snowden"", ""NSA"", ""N.S.A."", ""National Security Agency"", ""spying"", ""spies"", ""Spy agency"", ""Spy agencies"", ""مارتيخ ̷̴̐خ"", ""White House"", ""Obama"", ""0bama"", ""CIA"",  ""FBI"", ""GCHQ"", ""DEA"", ""FCC"", ""Congress"", ""Supreme Court"", ""State Department"", ""State Dept"", ""Pentagon"", ""Assange"", ""Wojciech"", ""Braszczok"", ""Front page"", ""Comcast"", ""Time Warner"", ""TimeWarner"", ""AT&amp;T"", ""Obamacare"", ""davidreiss666"", ""maxwellhill"", ""anutensil"", ""Bitcoin"", ""bitcoins"", ""dogecoin"", ""MtGox"", ""US government"", ""U.S. government"", ""federal judge"", ""legal reason"", ""Homeland"", ""Senator"", ""Senate"", ""Congress"", ""Appeals Court"", ""US Court"", ""EU Court"", ""U.S. Court"", ""E.U. Court"", ""Net Neutrality"", ""Net-Neutrality"", ""Federal Court"", ""the Court"", ""Reddit"", ""flappy"", ""CEO"", ""Startup"", ""ACLU"", ""Condoleezza""]

There are some keywords listed in /u/creq's post that I did not find in our AutoModerator configuration, such as ""Wyden"", which are not present in any version of our AutoModerator configuration that I looked at. 

There was significant infighting over this and some of the junior moderators were shuffled out in favor of new mods, myself included. The new moderation team does not believe that this condition, as well as several others present in our AutoMod control page, are appropriate for this subreddit. As such we will be rewriting our configuration from scratch (note that spam domains and bans will most likely be carried over).

I would also like to note that there was, as far as I can tell, no malicious intent from any of the former mods. They did what they thought was best for the community, there's no need to go after them for it.

We'd really like to have more transparent moderation here and are open to all suggestions on how we can accomplish that so that stuff like this doesn't happen as much/at all.",965,794,2014-04-17,TECH,0.11344139277935028,0.8626584410667419,0.02390015311539173

technology,[Meta] Does anyone else think the new /r/technology is terrible?,"It has turned 100% into /r/technologypolitics

I guess that was what they were trying to avoid. Last night 23 of the top 25 posts were the same post about net neutrality. The other two posts were political also. It's basically the same now. 

I know I can make my own sub, and I know I can gtfo without anyone missing me, but it is my opinion that this sub very quickly turned into /r/politics and barely has anything to do with technology anymore (non-politicized technology, and politics has been the forerunner anyways, with ""technology"" on the backburner). 


Well, I don't like it. 

I'd rather hear about phones and computers and servers, etc. There's  so many places on reddit to do politics. And it has ruined this subreddit. I checked out /r/tech. Same shit. 


Edit: It's a pretty frustrating discussion. What I recommend is a stickied post at the top by the mods for the hot topics for however long they are relevant, rather than hundreds of links to the same or same-ish article. This is common in many subreddits to avoid such clutter. 

What I would also recommend is:

/r/politics 

/r/news 

/r/conspiracy 


And, no, it is not an insane idea that /r/technology discusses things besides US politics, and actually discusses things such as technology news. 

I think everyone should listen to /u/catmoon

technology,Meshnets: I have a funny feeling big ISPs don't know what might hit them if Net Neutrality fails.,"Darknet should be renamed as Lightnet or something positive (New_net?), which should prevail as the #1 way to connect to the internet. This method should allow every device to connect and contribute to the new_net peer-to-peer internet-network. All wireless devices, router or laptop, would help aid in the transfer and the freedom of information.

Given that ISPs only use about 2 cents / 1 GB, and charge us $1-2 for the same thing, it is becoming highly apparent that they will be greatly not needed in the future.

Imagine sharing files from your house, without having to ask permission from your ISP, or worry about a hefty ftp server charge / or ban. Imagine using your cell phone for free, without any service charges or agreements in well-populated areas.

Because the FCC isn't doing their job with equal rights regulation of the internet, and falling to lobbying, the government will adversely make it very tough to find criminals on the internet on their own. Because packets are decentralized, they would have to ask for individualized help to extract answers, instead of always spying on us. Hopefully this symbiotic relationship creates more trust between the people and their governments.

The current form of Internet already includes decentralized compatibility functions. Such as packet distribution through multiple points. It just so happens that all packets are largely routed with ISP-owned routers. With the possibility of your information being blindly passed on from your ISP to 3rd parties such as the NSA, MPAA, RIAA without your permission.

In the future, routers in houses/busineses will contribute to the New'net using load-balancing features. This will be based on how much CPU power the router isn't using at the time, and what signal strengths are available.

Initially, ISPs will fight the idea, but they started this process a long time ago when they started putting data caps on 50 $ a month plans (remember that 200 GB would cost them about 4 dollars). New'net will also alleviate everyones legal liability via anonymizing information packets. Information is free, and freedom of information should be as well (with only a very small electricity charge or zero with a small solar panel / battery) This method retorts humanity back into a positive mindset: that humans are generally caring of others, and they will do positive things if given the chance.

I'm personally in IT and am amazed at how supremely complicated the internet can get in its current form. This complication leads to blind eyes being granted, and backdoors being allowed. In this mesh-net scenario, the idea is to simplify and to take millions of cheap and simple devices and make them profoundly useful.

tl;dr - Internets can be taken away from ISPs and ^ is how it might happen.

technology,"Two Years Ago, We Got Organized And Beat SOPA. Now, We Need To Do It Again To Preserve Net Neutrality.","**FINAL EDIT: [The current top thread on r/technology](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/) is rallying exactly the brand of activism I hoped we might see. /u/Antoine3323's [excellent, comprehensive post](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/ch6j7v5) is a better resource than I managed to provide here for contacting the organizations we need to be reaching out to. Please take advantage of this and reach out! (Antoine3323's template is a great jumping off point, but I highly recommend taking a couple minutes to personalize your message and tailor it to your specific audience for a better shot at getting their attention.) That post was made on a thread that /u/SomeKindOfMutant kicked off with a [wonderful call to action](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/ch6e4mb). Everyone who has taken the time to advocate for Net Neutrality, thank you! Keep fighting!**

[The January 18, 2012 blackouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA#Protests_of_January_18.2C_2012) were critical in raising widespread awareness and action against SOPA. If we're going to successfully fight the FCC's new ""fast lane"" rules and preserve Net Neutrality, we're going to need to be able to form that kind of highly visible coalition again.


Free Press is organizing [May 15 protests](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-aaron/wake-up-internet-time-to_b_5207303.html) in D.C., to coincide with Tom Wheeler's scheduled release of the rule-change proposal. That seems like an opportune date for prominent sites to black out to draw attention to the cause (or at the very least, replace their logos with links to the Free Press site for their users to take action).


So don't stop at contacting your [Senators and Representatives](http://contactingthecongress.org) and the [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/contact-us) demanding that broadband be reclassified as a telecommunications service under Title II. Scan the list of participants in the 01-18-12 SOPA strike [toward the bottom of this page](http://sopastrike.com) for sites you frequent, and contact their admins imploring them to black out again on May 15 for Net Neutrality. If you can think of anyone else who's pro-open web who has a highly visible online platform, please contact them as well.


We know Google, Reddit, and the Wikimedia Foundation are all pro-Net Neutrality. If we can push any one of them to replicate what they did to fight SOPA, we can generate millions of petition signatures, as well as calls and emails to Congress and the FCC. Even contacting the writer of your favorite webcomic or high-profile blog has the potential to make a huge difference.


We can stop the internet as we know it from slipping away from us. We can force the federal government to keep it open and competitive. We just need to grow our coalition to get there.


**EDIT 1:** A lot of you are asking for sample letters to send to your elected officials. In addition to a petition you can sign, there are [sample scripts for phone calls to both Congress and the FCC](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do) on the Free Press ""Save the Internet"" page. /u/jkcsblue also provided a [concise sample letter](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4l3cy) if you'd like one.

However, my main hope in creating this thread was for people to go beyond contacting the FCC/Congress and try to tap into the broader audiences held by Reddit and other prominent sites. For instance, it would be incredible if we could get some calls to Netflix going (1-866-579-7172 is their customer service line) asking them to change their logo with a link to the [Free Press Save the Internet page](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do) on May 15. They're a huge player with a massive user base and they stand to lose a lot from this change.


**EDIT 2: [I'm starting a thread below](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4nkec) for people to post who they've contacted and any responses they've gotten. Thank you so much for your support of this cause!**


**EDIT 3:** Some great suggestions for action have been posted.

* /u/SomeKindOfMutant suggests writing a letter to the editor of your local newspaper [that mentions one of your Senators or your Representative by name](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4qnr5). Free Press has tips for writing a letter to the editor [here](http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/resources/letter-to-the-editor.pdf).
* /u/SuicidalImpulse explains [why the WWE would be a great organization to contact](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4rjgq), and /u/hodaza provides a [contact link](http://www.wwe.com/main-help/contact-us) for them. This is exactly what we're looking for--organizations with a sizable web presence that have a stake in this issue. Not everyone we go after has to be Google or Netflix (though it would be great if we could get their attention too).


**EDIT 4:**

* /u/majesticsteed points out [gaming companies](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4xgjf) stand to gain a great deal from Net Neutrality. Here's [Valve's contact page](http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php) if anyone wants to request that they put a link to [the Free Press page](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do) in Steam on May 15.
* Those of you pointing out that broader issues such as campaign finance are the real problem, you're not wrong. But eliminating big money in US politics (even just getting us back to a pre-Citizens United level of *relative* sanity), is going to be a vastly larger, longer fight and a free and open web will be an essential tool in that battle.


**EDIT 5:**

From the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/249xs6/the_fcc_has_offered_an_email_address_for_users_to/) currently right above us in this sub:

* Here's a [Whitehouse.gov petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/reclassify-internet-broadband-providers-common-carriers/4MrqLTlV) to reclassify internet broadband providers as common carriers. Please sign it, share it, and recommend that any sites you're contacting post it. Thanks, /u/Qlanger!
* Though the FCC has put up openinternet@fcc.gov as a dedicated email address for input on the May 15 rule proposal, [contacting the FCC commissioners directly](https://www.fcc.gov/contact-us) might be a better way of getting their attention. It certainly can't hurt to do both!


**EDIT 6: Upvoting this and joining the discussion here is great, but please, pick even *one* organization, large or small, that you think would make a good ally on this, go to their contact page, and call/write them asking them to join the May 15 protest. We have the potential to reach an enormous audience here if everyone is willing to pitch in a little.**

**Some suggestions:**

* Ask Netflix to change their logo on May 15 in support of Net Neutrality, and to provide a link to an action page such as [Free Press's](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do). 1-866-579-7172
* Ask [Google](http://www.google.com/contact/) to do the same (though they're more likely to link directly to a public petition), much like they did to fight SOPA.
* Ask [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us_-_Press) to go dark again.
* Ask the [WWE](http://www.wwe.com/main-help/contact-us) to black out their site on May 15.
* Ask [Wired](http://www.wired.com/about/feedback/) to go dark like they did in protest of SOPA.
* Contact [Gawker Media](http://advertising.gawker.com/about/#contact) requesting that they black out their sites or change their logos on May 15.
* Contact [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php) asking them to use Steam to draw attention to the issue. (Other video game companies have a huge stake in this as well--it wouldn't be a bad idea to try Blizzard, for instance.)
* Contact the writer of your favorite blog or webcomic, especially if they [participated in the SOPA protest](http://sopastrike.com).

**This is the future of the internet we're fighting for. Please don't just upvote; take ten minutes out of your day and reach out to someone!**

**EDIT 7:** For those of you wondering what Net Neutrality is, why it's in danger, and how it can be saved: [This page from Free Press](http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-resources), in addition to its calls to action, provides several helpful explanatory links--perhaps most notably [this overview](http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now).

**EDIT 8:** I've been getting questions about what non-US citizens can do to help. US public officials may not be overly concerned with non-citizens' thoughts, but the multinational corporations (such as Netflix, Google, and gaming companies) that are essential to fighting this issue may be receptive to the opinions of their non-American users. Please contact one (or many) of them!

**EDIT 9:** A huge thanks to /u/galenwolf for putting in the time to hunt down a [comprehensive list of contact information](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch5ub12) for video game companies that have a huge stake in Net Neutrality.

This isn't even including the [$2,644,678.00 in PAC spending](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00248716&amp;cycle=2014) by Comcast so far this year.  [(Where that $2m went.)](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cmte=C00248716&amp;cycle=2014)  For an explanation on why this isn't corrupting and why money is speech and why corporations are people I would encourage you to look up Citizens United vs FEC, 2011.

If you want to get money out of politics you have some options for getting involved:

Getting money out of politics ([and why it's important that we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kHACjrdEY)):

 * [Move to Amend](https://www.movetoamend.org/)  *""We, the People of the United States of America, reject the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United and other related cases, and move to amend our Constitution to firmly establish that money is not speech, and that human beings, not corporations, are persons entitled to constitutional rights.*""

 * [Represent.us](https://represent.us/) seeks to pass a law ending corruption in politics by way of ""[The American Anti-Corruption Act](http://www.anticorruptionact.org/)"" which would end lobbying, mandate transparency for PACs and SuperPACs as well as imposing spending limits on political action committees.  (**Thanks to /u/Battlingdragon for the URL correction**)
 
Tracking money in politics:

 * [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/)  *""OpenSecrets.org is your nonpartisan guide to money's influence on U.S. elections and public policy. Whether you're a voter, journalist, activist, student or interested citizen, use our free site to shine light on your government.""*
 
Electoral reform:

 * [FairVote.org](http://www.fairvote.org)  *""FairVote educates and empowers Americans to remove the structural barriers to achieving a representative democracy that respects every vote and every voice in every election.""*

------
I would suggest that you call up your representative and express your feelings on Net Neutrality (Even if your representative *isn't* on this list) and explain that you're a voter, you're politically active and how s/he votes and acts on Net Neutrality or the Comcast/TWC merger will effect your voting and donations in the future.
