Be weary of shady employees!,"My wife went to the local Verizon store to buy two iPhones (not even on her line, they were gifts for two members of our family) and had quite the experience. She isn't particularly up to date on technology news, but she just went in to pick up the phones and pay so I had no worries. However, in the store, the employee informed her that because she was purchasing a new smart phone, all of the people on our plan had to get rid of unlimited data and switch to pooled data. 4 of the 6 people on our plan *had* unlimited data.
     The employee told her, ""All unlimited data will be gone in June anyways, but it will be easier for you to do it now and pool your data."" Bless her heart, she caved in and now we have 8 people sharing 10GB/month.
     I myself would power through a solid 8-10gb a month. Now I am stuck at just over 2GB (assuming everyone shares equally).

BE WARNED! 

Verizon employees have been manipulative ever since the first time I dealt with them. This is the cherry on top. We are switching as soon as possible. 

I don't know the validity of his statement about eliminating all unlimited data in June, but regardless, Verizon is shady. Be vigilant.
