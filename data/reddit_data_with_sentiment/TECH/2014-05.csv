Is now a good time to upgrade my TV? I'm not even sure if I would notice the difference between 720p and 1080p to be honest. But I'm also thinking maybe I should wait for 4K to come down in price a bit more. I've seen seem selling for £1,500. 

How long do you think it will be until 4K TVs are selling for around the prices of HD TVs are now? Will the cheapest 4K TV give a better overall picture than a Full HD TV at the same price when a 1080p picture is being up-scaled? 

Are prices likely to drop much at any point in the next 12 months, or is now as good a time as any to make a purchase? I'm looking to spend around £500.

Are there any particular models or features I should look for?

technology,Welcome to the new /r/technology!,"This is just a friendly update from your [mod team](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/about/moderators) here at /r/technology.

First, we've implemented some new CSS. /u/awkwarddev, /u/preggit, /u/heckytorr, and I worked hard on it, so we hope you like it! If you notice any problems with it, please bring it to our attention and we will try to sort it out.

You may also notice that there is a new rule in the sidebar regarding links to mobile sites. We have decided that it would be best for submitters and the community that we only permit links to desktop versions of sites. This way, readers can more easily view the content, and the post will likely gain more attention. Additionally, please remember to flair your posts! This helps readers find them when filtering by topic.

We would like to keep a close watch on spam, non-technology articles, and editorialized titles. One of the best ways you all can help out is to click the ""report"" button on any item that doesn't belong here or breaks our rules. On top of that, we will always leave a reason if we feel the need to remove your post, either via a comment or link flair.

We want you to know that you can always feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechmods) if you have anything you would like to discuss, be it a post removal, suggestion, or just to say hi. We will be sure to get back to you in a timely matter. Moderating a large subreddit like this is often a thankless job, so we would love to hear from you every once in a while! :)

gadgets,Will mobile devices (smartphones &amp; tablets) become the dominant media for entertainment?,"Statistics show that we, the younger audiences, are increasingly turning towards the Internet for entertainment. We don't want to watch Game of Thrones when it's on TV but when it suits us: after the assignment, before the assignment or at 4 in the morning. We also want to choose where and how much of it we see: one episode or all of them. Fact is, we want the choice. 

In addition, almost all of us have mobile devices, smartphones and tablets, that we use in the bus, train or school and that we can connect with at more and more places.  ‘On-demand' meets 'on the go' and fits better into our flexible lifestyles. With Internet becoming increasingly omnipresent and new, powerful mobile devices being produced thick and fast, broadcasters are putting their feelers out to mobile entertainment. But do mobile devices have what it takes to become the No. 1 entertainment media? What do you think?",93.0,99,2014-05-26,TECH,0.02005644142627716,0.914738118648529,0.06520538777112961
