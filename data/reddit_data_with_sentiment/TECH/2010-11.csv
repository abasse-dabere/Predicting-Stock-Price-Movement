gadgets,My list of sites with free shipping and cheap gadgets. Please let me know if I missed one.,"**Clarification:** Not all redditors are from the US. I'm not. I will only put sites on this list that has free worldwide shipping on at least a large portion of the things they sell. You don't need to suggest sites that only ship to the US.

[DealExtreme](http://www.dealextreme.com/products.dx/top.sellers~r.66422016) - Has around thirty thousand articles. Has been around for a long time. Home of the infamous 78 cent [pig light](http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.1138~r.66422016).

[Focalprice](http://www.focalprice.com) - Also quite huge. Big competitor of DX. Also has the pig light for 78 cents. Mostly the same stuff that DX has, but there are differences. Ten thousand articles.

[Tinydeal](http://www.tinydeal.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;sk=1267084484YV) - Fairly new player, also sells on eBay. Has some hard to get stuff that the others aren't selling, like pepper sprays and electric shock pistols. Very generous bonus system, and the lowest prices I've found outside of eBay. Also has a nice assortment of Chinese cellphones.

[Kaidomain](http://www.kaidomain.com) - Started by old DX employees. Has a very wide range of flashlights and parts. Has used the Christmas theme since the Christmas of two years ago.

[Pandawill](http://www.pandawill.com) - Haven't tried yet.

[ePathChina](http://www.epathchina.com) - Haven't tried yet. Not everything has free shipping.

[AliExpress](http://www.aliexpress.com) - Simpler version of Alibaba.com, a global trading site. Has a search option to find things with free shipping. You can find real bargains here, but the site is very messy and the search function isn't very good.

[eBay](http://www.ebay.com) - Almost always has the lowest prices for simple things like cables and cellphone accessories. Just remember to search for items that are available to where you live (this gives you search results from eBay global and not only ebay.com).

EDIT: Some additions:

[Mertiline](http://www.meritline.com) - Haven't tried yet, but others seem to like it.

[BuyinCoins](http://www.buyincoins.com) - Haven't tried yet.

EDIT 2: Yay, first page! Some more additions:

[NDSCardsale](http://www.ndscardsale.com/~r.1288857858U28095) - Haven't tried it myself, but they have gotten good reviews by others. Has flashcarts for Nintendo DS, USB dongles for PS3 and other video game accessories.

[DinoDirect](http://www.dinodirect.com/?midd=10273) - Haven't tried it myself. Some good reviews, some bad. Wide selection.

[Brando](http://www.brando.com/) - Haven't tried it myself. Site looks pretty shitty, but they have some nice things.

[GoldenGadgets](https://www.goldengadgets.com) - Nice selection of flashlights and solar power gadgets and equipment.

EDIT 3: Found this one today:

[Pokydady](http://pokydady.com) - Wide assortment of pens and other stationery.

EDIT 4: Another new addition:

technology,Today I saw a man motioning at his cellphone wildly...,"I was on my way back from Seoul to my apartment outside of the city. As I was getting off the train and walking through the terminal, I saw an older korean man (60's at least) looking at an open cell phone in front of him in the same way one would look at a book. He was holding it with one hand and gesticulating with the other.


He was on video chat. It took me  a second of looking while walking before boom, I realizing he's using sign language to speak to another person. I don't know why this blew me away, but at that moment I realized that even though I found video chat to be a novelty, now this man can convey the way he feels over long distance in a language he knows. One could point out that the man could text before video chat, but that's not nearly as intimate. Not nearly the same as seeing someones emotions. Their smile. Their sadness. 


It was just a little humbling and I thought I'd share. Most of the time technology just brings us new ways to wank it, or show off our wealth. It was nice seeing technology in the wild enriching someones life in a way that one wouldn't normal expect or it was originally designed for.",976,1992,2010-11-04,TECH,0.030237438157200813,0.9144349098205566,0.0553276427090168

technology,Filevo.com data being held hostage by hosting company. Help?,"It's with a heavy heart that I write this - currently, all filevo data is being held hostage by our hosting company. To give a quick summary of how things went down;

around 48 hours ago, we received a DMCA request, as a user uploaded a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS4. We're no strangers to legal requests - filesharing sites, video sites, image portals etc etc; we all get a couple of DMCA notices per day. And we handle them in timely fashion - usually within 30 minutes of a notice being sent, we have the file removed from our servers, and a mail sent back informing the copyright holder of this.

The case with Adobe Photoshop CS4 was no different: We received the original DMCA notice at Mon, November 8, 2010 1:46 pm. The file was removed, and an email was sent back informing both our host's security company, our hosts, and the copyright agency in question at 2:08 pm. We received a response from our hosts at 3:02 pm on the same date, thanking us for our co-operation - usual DMCA response.

Yesterday, at 1.30pm, our server went down. We raised this with our host's support team, who were unsure of what the problem was. They cited a possible datacenter issue. At 2:17 pm, we received an exact carbon copy of the DMCA notice involving Adobe Photoshop CS4, stating that we have 72 hours to remove the file, otherwise we will be subject to an IP Block. We then got word from our support team that an IP block had been put in place.

After sending a mail back to the security team, informing them that the file had already been deleted - they responded by stating that we need to log in by VPN to remove the file. I responded again quoting our previous correspondence in dealing with this file, and reminded them that the file was already removed.

They responded by simply saying I hadn't provided enough information to them. I probably deal with a minimum of 20-30 DMCA notices per week through filevo, and have never heard any complaint regarding this before. I went under the assumption that they wanted details on the uploader - which we are not legally obliged to divulge. I sent back an email relaying all the above, and quoting our previous mails once again.

Following this and a phonecall to their support team, they seemed to have a change of heart - and stated that they will get us back online. They then sent back a reply stating that the only way the security team will allow us back online is if we wipe every bit of data we have with them, and reload our OS. They refuse to allow us access to back up any of our source code, database, or any file whatsoever. When I requested why this was, they simply replied that due to the severity of the issue, I had to be disconnected immediately rather than granted the DMCA safe harbor 48 hours.

This is not exactly what I asked - but I then responded with a mail stating that this cannot be true, as the infringing file in question was already removed around 24hrs~ before the carbon copy mail was sent. I received a canned reply again stating that all data will need to be wiped.

I've sent on another reply going into the legal logistics of this, and how it is completely outside the DMCA to hold our data hostage when we have been fully compliant in all requests - and are being held on the grounds of a file that didn't exist on our servers when the current abuse ticket was opened. The mail has been ignored.

I've no idea what to do here - I've never been in a situation where a hosting company has held data hostage over a file that does not exist on my servers. We currently push out around 1TB of data per day, and have several paid customers. The company in question is Midphase, and their security company is Softlayer. We had already previously taken steps to ensure that our users cannot be identified, by ensuring IP's are never stored. Would anyone at Reddit be capable of providing any advice on what we can legally do from here to protect both our users, and our users' content?",20,61,2010-11-10,TECH,0.14236845076084137,0.8361058235168457,0.021525749936699867

technology,"Knowledge about ""Super-secret debug capabilities of AMD processors"" ( 9C5A203A ) is at least five years old.","The ""Super-secret debug capabilities of AMD processors"" that was supposedly just discovered is old news for us CPU hackers.

IIRC, I first started hearing about the Knowledge about the magic 0x9c5a203a / 9C5A203A value around ten years ago. Here is a five year old post that discusses it:

From http://www.overclockers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=403019&amp;page=2

""There's a few interesting things on first glance. AMD claims in the datasheets that the THERMTRIP MSR (C0010043) has been deleted, but it still very much exists with correct data in your dump. Secondly, the range C0010030 -&gt; C0010035 are still used for the processor name string (semi-documented by AMD). In addition, two more registers (C001003E and C001003F) have appeared in the same approximate area, compared to the K7. They're filled with zeros, though, so who knows what they do. Less interesting are the semi-documented MSRs 00000000, 00000001, and 0000008B.

Then we get on to the juicy ones. AMD actively hides the C0011xxx MSRs by requiring a register (edi) to contain a 'magic' value, otherwise the register will appear not to exist. Of course, this value was quickly found when people disassembled BIOSes (as there are some uses for these registers to fix bugs) and now it is semi-common-knowledge umong people interested in these things. Good to see that AMD hasn't changed the magic value Basically, nothing is known about the C0011xxx registers. All that is known is that you can do some really low-level tweaking of the CPU through changing them. AMD uses them to modify the operation of the CPU to fix bugs, but won't tell you anything about them. For example, eratta #110 can be fixed by writing a 1 to bit 32 of MSR C001_1005h. Doesn't tell you anything about what this particular bit does, or what the register does, but you can get a few ideas by reading the eratta details.

Sometimes they slip out a few more details by leaving in the register name and bit name: 'In MP systems, set BU_CFG.WbPfSmcChkDis (bit 45 of MSR 0xC001_1023).' From this, I'd say that MSR C0011023 is the bus unit configuration register, though the bit name doesn't provide much information.

Similarly, there are many 'reserved' bits in the documented registers which actually do things. You can notice these through careful cross-checking of the eratta sheets and the documentation, and through BIOS disassembly. Unfortunately, neither gets you much information on what the bit does, and in 99.9% of cases, flipping the bit will either do nothing visible or lock the machine up.

OK, that's probably enough rambling on MSRs. As I mentioned just before, they aren't of any use in this case, but it's still some interesting numbers to look through ""

I mean, thats not to say they were ever high quality, but at least it was fun geeky stuff to read all the time.  It started going downhill when Jesus and Rosa began posting.  Its not too often they post anything relevant to tech, and when they do its ignorant bitching and ranting.  Then, when Gizmodo readers call out the article in any way, they go off on their readers.  When the readers get angry and post that a blog post has nothing to do with technology, Gizmodo writers go off on their readers.  Same when a reader may call out a Gizmodo writer on being outright wrong.

Theres also the all-too-common blog posts about how they hate constructive criticism and trying to teach their readers how to comment.  

Back on the topic of how Gizmodo isn't really a tech blog: do they NOT realize they have the whole Gawker network?  I don't care about food posts, they don't belong in a tech blog.  Fit them in to your other niche blog. 

So to my question - what tech blogs does Reddit read?  I know of Engadget and Techcrunch, both of which are ""meh"".  I don't hate them, but I don't love them.  Techcrunch is also guilty of having writers that are notorious for posting useless crap that doesn't belong anywhere in a tech blog.
