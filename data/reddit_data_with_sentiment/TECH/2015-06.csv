Help get to the bottom of this.","**TL;DR: our anti-TPP political website [stopfasttrack.com](https://www.stopfasttrack.com) got blacklisted by Twitter, Facebook, and major email providers as malicious/spam even though we have done nothing wrong. If you received spam with this domain name, or have any idea what could be going on, please private message me.**

Hi, I'm Jeff Lyon, CTO at [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org). We're the non-profit activism group behind [Battle for the Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com), [Blackout Congress](https://www.blackoutcongress.org), and [Stop Fast Track](https://www.stopfasttrack.com)—a campaign to fight the secret Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal.

The last time I brought some [very shady activity](http://www.reddit.com/comments/2psxh9/) to reddit's attention, I had good, solid facts. Unfortunately, right now I have only questions and speculation, but clearly something nasty is happening.

In the last week, our [Stop Fast Track](https://www.stopfasttrack.com) website has been flagged as malicious and blacklisted from Twitter, Facebook, and [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/), an anti-spam filtering company. This means that, over the last week, nobody could post our website on social networks, or send any emails with our URL. The major email providers check SpamHaus' [Domain Block List](https://www.spamhaus.org/dbl/) to identify malicious URLs, so any email containing the stopfasttrack.com URL was automatically flagged as spam and blocked from being delivered.

It's worth noting that we have not sent unsolicited emails to anyone, and there is nothing malicious on the domain. We follow industry best practices for our mailing list and immediately unsubscribe anyone who wishes to unsubscribe. Our sender reputation is over 98.5%, which basically means that our supporters are happy with our emails and we have not been doing anything shady or spammy. In short, there is no reason our domain should have been blacklisted.

The timing of this is very interesting. In the last week, we've focused our activism efforts on the House of Representatives, where the TPP faces an uphill battle. According to inside sources, the trade bill would _fail_ if it were brought to a vote today. Obama and the TPP's corporate supporters have pulled out all the stops to lobby the House. This is a crucial time to stop the forward momentum of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and it seems like we actually have a chance to kill it. It's also the worst possible time for our site to go dark.

The stopfasttrack.com website makes it really easy to contact your lawmakers. There's a phone tool on it that calls your phone and connects you directly to your lawmakers in the House and Senate, and we also have an email tool that lets you send a letter to all of your in-district lawmakers with one click. This type of direct action has been hugely effective in our campaigning around [net neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com) and [mass surveillance](https://www.blackoutcongress.org), and could really tip the scales on TPP, too. Unfortunately, this will not be possible if our web site is basically banned from the Internet.

This is not the first time our site has been blacklisted. Last year, right before a huge campaign day on stopfasttrack.com, the site was flagged as malicious by antivirus programs, and anyone with these installed couldn't visit the site.

**We need your help finding out what happened.**

Since we found out about the blacklisting, we've reached out to all of the networks involved and had the bans lifted. But nobody will tell us anything about _why_ the site was blocked in the first place (the companies seem to have policies against sharing this info). So we need help getting to the bottom of this.

One obvious reason for the blacklisting could be that someone actually sent spam or phishing emails with the stopfasttrack.com domain in it. I don't know whether this happened or not, but if anyone on reddit received such an email, I would really like to know about it.

It's also possible that someone with the power to influence Spamhaus and major social networks was able to pull strings and simultaneously ban our site from all of these networks. I'd really like to believe this is not the case, because it would imply that crucial anti-spam infrastructure could be abused to effectively censor any political web site with which a powerful actor disagrees. This would be an absolute worst case for freedom of speech on the Internet. Again, I'm not saying that's what's going on, just flagging it as a possibility.

If you have any idea about what could have happened, please chime in!",615,5988,2015-06-05,TECH,0.0961100310087204,0.8813217282295227,0.022568274289369583

technology,"Did you know that your privacy rights are currently under threat? ICANN* – the overseers of the Internet’s domain name system – are considering introducing a rule that would impact all netizens. If you care about your online privacy, this is a big deal.","[What's Happening](https://www.respectourprivacy.com/)


Under new guidelines proposed by MarkMonitor and others who represent the same industries that backed SOPA, domain holders with sites associated to ""commercial activity"" will no longer be able to protect their private information with WHOIS protection services. ""Commercial activity"" casts a wide net, which means that a vast number of domain holders will be affected. Your privacy provider could be forced to publish your contact data in WHOIS or even give it out to anyone who complains about your website, without due process. Why should a small business owner have to publicize her home address just to have a website?

We think your privacy should be protected, regardless of whether your website is personal or commercial, and your confidential info should not be revealed without due process. If you agree, it’s time to tell ICANN.

To view the new proposed rules, visit: [Privacy &amp; Proxy Services Accreditation Issues Policy.](https://gnso.icann.org/en/issues/raa/ppsai-initial-05may15-en.pdf)

technology,Reddit is selling ad space to a doxxing website,"I'm only posting about it because I've seen this advertisement many times:

http://i.imgur.com/6HguIyh.png

Anyone else seen these ads? 

Blurred the site name out because I don't want to give them publicity. You probably know the one, anyway. 

It's one of those sites where you put in a name and it pulls up matches based on public records and social media accounts. I searched my name on it. Luckily, it didn't find me... but it found about 100 other people with a similar name to me and their criminal records, court records, divorce records and every possible embarrassing detail of their life... accessible at the click of a button. The reports cost money... up to $19.99 each. But when you say something controversial online and someone digs up your name... who's to say $20 is going to stop them? 

Additionally, they have this special going on where if you search someone and claim that it's you, they'll offer you a ""trial"" report for $1. What's to say I can't pose as someone I hate--whose name is public--and dig up every embarrassing detail about their life? For less than the price of a bottle of soda, even? 

But the real white elephant to me is: reddit explicitly *does not allow* this behavior. If you even make a sound like you're *going* to doxx somebody, that's a shadowban. Rightfully so. 

Yet, bizarrely, they're selling ad space to this company that, for a small fee, allows you to doxx people. It's contradictory... and *very* disturbing. 

Edit: Now in all fairness, it could easily be a mistake. I imagine it's difficult to monitor all ads coming in. But the reason I wanted to talk about it is that I've personally seen this ad on multiple subreddits. I figure *somebody* up there's had to see it.

Edit2: got lots of disagreement. Strained for time so I will just add this:. That's OK. You don't have to agree with me, but just entertain this thought for a moment: this website bans you for digging up dirt on somebody and posting it around... Then turns around and advertises a website like this. Can you see where that's a *little* contradictory?",881,3076,2015-06-28,TECH,0.05444389209151268,0.9219757914543152,0.023580269888043404
