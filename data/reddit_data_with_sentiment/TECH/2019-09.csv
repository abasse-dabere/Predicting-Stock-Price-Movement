technology,[Mod Post] Proposal banning pay walls and capped visit sites. Looking for input.,"Reddit was created as a way to foster discussion; /r/technology is no exception to that.

Yes, we know that there are work-arounds, but that also works around the purpose of this move. We, the mods of /r/technology, hope that we can encourage websites to allow access to their content for others to enjoy without cost to visitors.
