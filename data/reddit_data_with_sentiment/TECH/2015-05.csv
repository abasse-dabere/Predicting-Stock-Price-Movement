technology,Why did EFF just side with the NSA? They endorsed a toothless NSA reform bill that would extend the Patriot Act to 2019 and derail real reform.,"**TL;DR:** EFF [just endorsed the USA Freedom Act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done), a bill that would extend Section 215 of the Patriot Act until 2019, extending the NSA’s surveillance authority for years. At the same time, EFF is calling for an end to Section 215 of the Patriot Act: [fight215.org](https://www.fight215.org). Given the great work EFF has done on surveillance reform in the past, this is really disappointing.

This year’s USA Freedom Act is a significantly watered-down version of last year’s bill, which itself [didn’t go far enough](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/nov/19/how-usa-freedom-act-failed-on-all-fronts) to limit mass surveillance. Now, EFF has thrown their weight behind a bill that would do little if anything to prevent the NSA’s bulk surveillance of American citizens. They’ve thrown real privacy activists under the bus, just so they can get a meaningless reform bill passed and claim a PR victory.

**The USA Freedom Act will not stop NSA mass surveillance, even if it says it does.**

From what I can tell, the bill is supposed to look like reform, but in reality it reauthorizes the dragnet under new procedures that could make it even more invasive of our private lives. The authors of the bill claim to be reforming surveillance, but the reforms are gutted by caveats that seem to nullify every reform offered. 

This is how the sponsors of the bill and the NSA make it seem like reform: The government would have to use keywords to target individuals, accounts, or devices for surveillance, and they would be limited in what kinds of information they can collect from those individuals.

This is how they make it a dragnet: The government can then spy on all people who are connected to the primary targets in any way, and for these “second hop” targets they can collect much more personal information, including location data, smartphone activity, and more. The government can simply select primary targets that they can piggy-back on to give them broad access to personal information on millions of people.


Companies that hand over data, and they don't have to do it in ""good faith"", would be paid by the government and rewarded with special protections from lawsuits for violating user privacy (That’s why companies like Google and Yahoo have already announced their support).

The special advocate that gets to see FISC decisions doesn't get to see it when they decide there is reason for them to not see it. 

**USA Freedom is fake reform, and EFF just came out for it.**

EFF knows this bill won’t be effective. They are practically holding their nose throughout [their endorsement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done) of it, but it’s been almost two years since the Edward Snowden leaks, and they are so desparate for any kind of win on surveillance reform that they’re willing to endorse a bill that is nothing more than a slap on the wrist to the NSA.

Unfortunately, EFF’s support of this bill could derail any meaningful reform on NSA surveillance. Politicians will be able to say “look, we already dealt with mass surveillance, and EFF supported our bill.” EFF will be able to say “look, we passed some reforms on the NSA”, and the NSA will be able to continue doing whatever the hell it wants.

I’ve been a big supporter of EFF’s past work, but what is going on here? They shouldn’t settle for this watered-down USA Freedom Act and neither should we. As citizens, we have the ability to speak out and tell Congress that we won’t stand for mass surveillance any longer.",65,438,2015-05-04,TECH,0.06763934344053268,0.9018117785453796,0.03054887428879738

As the Lib Dems are now gone, it's up to us to prevent the [""snooper's charter""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_Communications_Data_Bill) that Theresa May wants to pass. Ideally, send those representing your constituency an e-mail and tweet them about opposing the Communications Data Bill. I will provide a link to the Parliament website in which you will be able to find your representative and their contact details.  It's time to stop making white noise and start making an effort to protect what we care about.

There's even some talk about organizing some events in Belfast to oppose the bill.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

David Davis, a Tory backbencher is [known to have issues](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/david-cameron-tries-to-convince-backbenchers-he-has-changed-leadership-style-in-attempt-to-head-off-rebellions-10238999.html) with the bill and is our best chance at gaining support from within the Tories.  With the support of you, the electorate, he'll have justification to further oppose and garner support.

David Davis - david.davis.mp@parliament.uk /

Michael Gove, the newly appointed Justice Secretary is rumored to be pushing the bill forward.

Let him know that you dissaprove of the bill at office@shca.org.uk or michael.gove.mp@parliament.uk

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The House of Lords is another great target.

A particular member, Lord Paul Strasburger is on our side and also wants to prevent such a bill from happening.  Let him know that you support him, and agree with what he is doing.

**[Lord Paul Strasburger has replied to our campaign on Twitter!](http://imgur.com/gBVyUav)**

A lord that hasn't been so agreeable with our views is Lord Blair of Boughton, who is one of the key players in moving the bill forward within the house of lords.  Let him know that you don't agree with the bill.

**If you're unsure of what to say in the e-mail to your constituency representative, here's a template;**

Dear (MP),

Firstly, I would like to congratulate you on being elected to Westminster. As a member of your constituency, there has been a growing concern with the new Conservative Government. It has come to my attention that Theresa May is planning to move forward on the Communications Data Bill, which I view as a massive infringement of privacy and civil rights. I was hoping that you will be opposing this bill in Westminster.

Yours Sincerely,

(Your name)

A lot of information has come through.  

If your local MP agrees or refuses to oppose the Bill, let us know here!

/u/retronewb has suggested hitting the streets to get signatures and support the old fashioned way.  

If you can get a group of people together in your area to hit the streets, please do so!

A friend of mine that is a low-level member of the Conservative's, standing for them in local elections had made me aware that this will most likely cause ruptures within the Government, and may be the first bill to fail under the Tories.

George Hollingbery, [a Tory, is in support of the bill.](https://twitter.com/GHollingbery/status/597358322778509312)

/u/IPhoneorAndroid has had a reply from Lord Strasburger;
&gt;You are correct that I oppose any legislation that is unduly intrusive and/or repressive. Now that the Commons lacks a large liberal voice, it will be up to the Lords and concerned citizens to resist security-at-all-costs proposals.

&gt;I have long been an opponent of the Communications Data Bill and (without the insertion of judicial approval) will continue to oppose it.

/u/Illgiveyouthekey has received a reply this morning from their parents Conservative MP - John Glenn, Salisbury. &gt;Quite impressed with the turn around, although he did spell my name wrong:
&gt;Thank you for writing to me about the proposed Communications Data Bill.
&gt;I have taken note of your concerns but at the present moment, the text of the bill has not been published so I &gt;cannot comment in full. I can however reassure you that, when the bill is published I will scrutinise it carefully &gt;before voting.
&gt;Additionally any bill passes through several stages of scrutiny within both Houses and within committees so I am &gt;confident that the legislation process will not be rushed and any concerns will be addressed fully. Any bill is &gt;properly scrutinised and I am confident, when the text of this bill is published, it will not threaten our hard won &gt;freedoms.
&gt;Thank you again for taking the time to write to me. If you have any further concerns once the detail of the bill has &gt;been published, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
&gt;Warm regards,
&gt;John

**/u/Inworkthrowaway has received a reply from Nick Hurd, MP for Ruislip, Northwoon &amp; Pinner.**
&gt;Thank you for your letter regarding the Draft Communications Data Bill.
&gt;I have noted your concerns and have raised them with The Rt Hon Theresa May MP. I have requested an official response which I will ensure you have sight of.
&gt;In the meantime, should you have any further queries or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The work you have all done over the period of a single day is absolutely outstanding, I would have never thought that this amount of people would be involved so quickly and most importantly, passionately.

You **must** keep up the pressure.  With senior officials, including the prime minister wanting this bill to pass, this will not be an easy fight to win.  Conventional means of online campaigning will not make them budge on this.  As such, we need to not only continue personally contacting our local MP's, but physically visiting them too.  Get together a group of friends, canvass your local area and attend advice surgeries (local meetings) of your MPs, which should be available on their personal website. Confront them on this issue, don't let up. Post their meeting times here.

Don't let them think for a second, that we're not committed, that we're a fleeting online passion.  

**If we get comfortable with sending out tweets and taking a few seconds to sign petitions, we will fail.**

**[The anti-SOPA and PIPA campaigns were fought and won through pressuring their representatives.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrydownes/2012/01/25/who-really-stopped-sopa-and-why/)**

They will ignore us unless we put in real world effort.  When they stop ignoring us, they'll twist the argument against us.  When that fails, and it will, we will have achieved what we set out to achieve.  Don't let them win.

gadgets,"thinking of buying a 4K TV, need advice","Hi!
I'm thinking of buying a 4K TV, about 55"". My budget is 2000€, and I'm looking for the best possible image quality on that price point. I don't really need 3D or smart gimmicks (as I can add an Apple TV or chromecast later). It has to have (at least one) HDMI 2.0 and digital audio out. I live in Portugal, so anything from Vizio is out of the question. I'm thinking of buying the Sony KD-55X8505C (comes out in June, I think).
Do you think I'm doing the right thing? Is there any other TV you recommend? Am I forgetting something? I really need all the help I can get :) Thanks!
PS:I found several references refering to apparently the same TV set, and I can't tell the difference between them. Any ideias?:

/u/bakabakablah found the cure for the Android app staying on your phone. (S)he says that you should clear your cache and explain how to do it **[HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/37z25i/more_proof_that_holaorg_is_using_your_internet/crrdqfc)**. For my phone (HTC One M8) I had to turn off the phone then hold down the POWER and VOLUME DOWN button until a screen appeared. After that I selected ""RECOVERY"" and was redirected to a new screen. The penultimate step was to select ""wipe cache partition"" and finally hit the ""reboot system now"" button. Thanks again to /u/bakabakablah for their assistance in the matter!

I recently mentioned to my tech savvy Dad that [Hola](http://Hola.org), a service I have given much praise to is in fact a [botnet](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/37xlgo/). My Dad was sceptical at first and I tried to give him proof but when I told him about the P2P aspect of Hola he suggested that I uninstall right away. I did but being a curious person I looked at the running processes on my phone using Developer Tools and found that the process org.Hola was still running, even though I had uninstalled it. Even worse, it had an uptime of 99%, meaning that anyone could be using my internet to do illegal activities. [Here's the proof that I could find.](http://imgur.com/a/gfSis).

As it's only been about half an hour since I 'uninstalled' it I can't be positive that it is still on my phone, but the fact that it has a 99% uptime shows beyond reasonable doubt that Hola was using my connection as a botnet.

I shall update this post as I get more information. I will be posting this to other subreddits such as /r/Netflix to raise awareness.",98,536,2015-05-31,TECH,0.03612721338868141,0.9267299771308899,0.03714276850223541
