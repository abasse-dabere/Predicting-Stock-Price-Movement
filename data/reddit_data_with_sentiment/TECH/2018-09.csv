[Censored] who live at [Censored]. His previous arrest history-public disturbance and was jailed for [~] days.

At 2018/9/9 around 16:00, at [address], the said person ‘went over the wall’(yes, they used the word ‘翻墙’) and used a foreign website ‘twitter’ to criticise the party and nation leaders. Due to the serious nature (of this incident), he was placed under arrest.

The above is confirmed by [evidence and other stuff].

Based on [some bullshit law but do they even need a law to arrest people anyways?] he will be jailed for 10 days.

[more bullshit bureaucratic stuff i don’t bother to translate]
