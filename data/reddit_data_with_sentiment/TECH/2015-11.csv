technology,How did I find out my ISP account suddenly has a data cap? Comcast/Xfinity blocked a site I was visiting and said I had reached my limit and usage fees would apply.,"This is really how I found out. No letter in the mail. Nothing on our bill about how much data we're using. I never thought I needed to know but not sure now when our plan rolls over. I live in Florida and must be in one of those ""data usage trial"" areas. Guess they're gauging how far customers will take their complaints. Well, I will be complaining with them (politely) and I will be complaining with the FCC as well. They said our limit was 300 GB. My daughter enjoys streaming from youtube kids on a daily basis. Not sure if I should be reasonable about the data cap since we do use the internet more than others but the way they are handling it?

Edit: they to the

Edit: Thank you all for your input. I will be calling customer service tomorrow (Monday) and documenting a complaint with them, the FCC and the FTC. I watch as much TV as I want and I don't believe I should be told how much internet I should use versus others by the same company.",1739,5641,2015-11-01,TECH,0.04498942196369171,0.9267017245292664,0.028308777138590813

technology,Leak of Comcast documents detailing the coming data caps and what you'll be told when you call in about it.,"Last night an anonymous comcast customer service employee on /b/ leaked these documents in the hopes that they would get out. Unfortunately the thread 404'd a few minutes after I downloaded these. All credit for this info goes to them whoever they are. 

This info is from the internal ""Einstein"" database that is used by Comcast customer service reps. Please help spread the word and information about this greed drive crap for service Comcast is trying to expand

~~[Documents here](http://imgur.com/gallery/7IHyH)~~ Got DMCA takedown'd afaik

Edit: TL;DR Caps will be expanding to more areas across the Southeastern parts of the United States. Comcast customer support reps are to tell you the caps are in the interest of 'fairness'. After reaching the 300 GB cap of ""unlimited data"" you will be charged $10 for every extra 50 GB. 

Edit 2: THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE THIS DOWN. New links!~~(Edit Addendum: Beware of NSFW ads if you aren't using an adblocker)~~ Edit: Back to Imgur we go.Check comments for mirrors too a lot of people have put them all over.

technology,"Dell ships laptops with rogue root CA, exactly like what happened with Lenovo and Superfish","I got a shiny new XPS 15 laptop from Dell, and while attempting to troubleshoot a problem, I discovered that it came pre-loaded with a self-signed root CA (Certificate Authority) by the name of [eDellRoot](https://i.imgur.com/DBromxS.png). With it came its private key, marked as non-exportable. However, it is still possible to obtain a raw copy of the private key by using several tools available (I used NCC Group's Jailbreak tool). After briefly discussing this with someone else who had discovered this too, we determined that they are shipping every laptop they distribute with the *exact same root certificate and private key*, very similar to what Superfish did on Lenovo computers. For those that aren't familiar, **this is a major security vulnerability that endangers all recent Dell customers**.

Surely Dell had to have seen what kind of bad press Lenovo got when people discovered what Superfish was up to. Yet, they decided to do the same thing but worse. This isn't even a third-party application that placed it there; it's from Dell's very own bloatware. To add insult to injury, it's not even apparent what purpose the certificate serves. At least with Superfish we knew that their rogue root CA was needed to inject ads into your web pages; the reason Dell's is there is unclear.

If you have recently bought a Dell computer and want to see if you are affected by this, go to **Start -&gt; type ""certmgr.msc"" -&gt; (accept on UAC prompt) -&gt; Trusted Root Certification Authorities -&gt; Certificates** and check if you have an entry with the name ""eDellRoot"". If so, congratulations, you've been pwned by Dell, the very company you paid for your computer!

Here is a [link to the certificate, private key, and PFX file](https://mega.nz/#F!kwgAQB7K!K6g2PSLyNmpWhQxne5NLfw) for the certificate I found on my machine. The password for the PFX file is ""dell"". (The certificate itself is in the eDellRoot.crt file. Do NOT import the PFX file unless you know what you're doing. I just included it for convenience.) If yours came with the eDellRoot certificate, its thumbprint will probably be:

    98:A0:4E:41:63:35:77:90:C4:A7:9E:6D:71:3F:F0:AF:51:FE:69:27

And its serial number:

    6b:c5:7b:95:18:93:aa:97:4b:62:4a:c0:88:fc:3b:b6

It's upsetting that Dell would do this despite the backlash Lenovo experienced from its customers and the [US Department of Homeland Security](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-051A), and I really hope they quickly do something to correct this. The more people that know and speak up, the faster it will happen.

---

**UPDATE:** I've been reading that a lot of people are skeptical in the sense that this CA can't actually do anything because the CA has no capabilities. I did some more research and found out that this CA *can indeed* sign server certificates. I've updated the list of files above to include a certificate issued by the CA with file name ""badgoogle.crt"", which you can also see in [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/T9CnRy6.png). For those that are unfamiliar with how this works, a network attacker could use this CA do sign his or her own fake certificates for use on real websites and an affected Dell user would be none the wiser unless they happened to check the website's certificate chain. This CA could also be used to sign code to run on people's machines, but I haven't tested this out yet.
