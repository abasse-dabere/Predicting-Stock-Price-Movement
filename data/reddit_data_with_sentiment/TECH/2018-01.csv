technology,"We have less than 24 hours to stop the NSA’s illegal mass surveillance program, and these lawmakers are key:","On Thursday Congress will vote on whether to codify into law the unconstitutional, mass electronic surveillance of all Americans without a warrant or probable cause, for the first time in U.S. history. 

They’ll do this despite the backlash of millions of people who called for an end to these illegal programs in the years since they were first revealed, and despite the security and intelligence experts who have said these programs make us less safe. 

And, this single move would definitely make us a less free and less safe society, by taking down the privacy and security rights that set open societies apart from repressed regimes. 

**The good news is that a 43-member, bipartisan group of lawmakers are gearing up to [stop the NSA's illegal surveillance program](https://reason.com/blog/2018/01/10/amash-paul-and-others-trying-to-stop-con).** 

Just fifty or so lawmakers can make the difference in this fight to bring our spying programs back within the limits of the US Constitution. 

These lawmakers, who are listed below, voted to end unconstitutional surveillance powers in the past but have since abandoned our rights to privacy and security for various reasons. That means, these representatives can be convinced to once again get on the right side If they get enough calls and emails in the next day and a half. 

**But we have to make sure this outcry happens as quickly as possible and reaches as many lawmakers as possible.** 

On Thursday, January 10th, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on expanding or ending the bulk of the US’ illegal surveillance of Americans through Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, ahead of its expiration on January 19th, 2018. US government agencies use Section 702 to justify the warrantless domestic surveillance of Americans, something also known as the “backdoor search” loophole. Through this loophole, the NSA, FBI, and CIA can monitor, collect, and illegally search through the data of Americans without a warrant. 

The House of Representatives has a choice to reauthorize Section 702 for another 6 years, without any reforms to rein in the government’s admitted and unconstitutional spying powers or end the backdoor search loophole. If they do the former and vote for the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017, they  would [expand](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/groups-line-meaningful-nsa-surveillance-reform) the government’s authority to conduct warrantless surveillance.

With Section 702’s expiration right around the corner, this is the moment we’ve been waiting for to hold lawmakers accountable to their promises to uphold the Fourth Amendment and reverse the government’s admitted illegal violation of our privacy rights.

These mass surveillance programs are [bad for our security and safety and make us all less free](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/07/18/too-much-surveillance-makes-us-less-free-it-also-makes-us-less-safe/?utm_term=.16fdf09294ca).  

**These are the lawmakers who need to hear from you.** They switched their position from a “yes” to a “no” on closing the backdoor search loophole between 2015 and 2016, and can be convinced to vote to end it now if they get enough calls, emails, and tweets. Call or tweet them now. Here’s what you can tell them:

*Defend the Fourth Amendment. Oppose the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 and any attempts to expand the government’s warrantless surveillance powers. Support amendments that end the backdoor search loophole and reinstate warrant protections for government surveillance programs.*

technology,"Last week, AT&amp;T ran a series of ads and tweets claiming to support net neutrality. This was really an attempt to gain support for bad net neutrality legislation that offers very few of the protections we had under Title II. We need your help exposing this astroturfing effort. Details in the thread.","Last week, AT&amp;T [took out](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/370472-att-urges-congress-to-pass-internet-bill-of-rights) full-page ads in a number of major newspapers nationwide claiming that the company supports net neutrality, and calling on Congress to pass legislation, a so-called “Internet Bill of Rights.” This comes just a day after year-end disclosures [show](http://variety.com/2018/politics/news/lobbying-spending-2017-1202673664/) AT&amp;T spent more than $16 million lobbying *against* net neutrality and Internet privacy protections last year alone.

At the exact same time that the ads went live, Congressional staffers reported that they started getting flooded with [mysterious tweets](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%22not%20a%20CRA%20that%20can%27t%20pass%22&amp;src=typd) using the hashtag “#netneutlawnow,” with a message reading: “We need real net neutrality - not a CRA that can't pass. Please pass a permanent net neutrality law!”

If you just search Twitter for the hashtag “#netneutlawnow,” you only find a few tweets, like [this one](https://twitter.com/ppi/status/954429304850472960), from the Progressive Policy Institute, a “think tank” that’s been partly [funded](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141203/09083129312/attempt-to-undermine-title-ii-support-broadband-industry-pretends-to-be-worried-about-your-soaring-broadband-bill.shtml) by … you guessed it: AT&amp;T. If you search for the phrase that’s tweeted, you see large numbers of identical tweets, which appear to be generated through a paid hashtag campaign geo-targeted at people’s lawmakers.

Astroturf efforts like these are just the latest in a [long](https://www.alternet.org/economy/corporate-interests-are-stealing-online-identities-and-faking-public-comments-repeal-pro) and sordid [history](https://theintercept.com/2017/05/23/net-neutrality-ncta/) of campaigns funded by big telecom companies attempting to create the false impression that there is grassroots support for their terrible positions on net neutrality and consumer privacy.

The purpose of these tweets is to spread misinformation. The ISPs’ plan has always been to use the “crisis” they created by gutting the FCC rules to ram through bad legislation that permanently undermines net neutrality while claiming to “save it.”

But this latest campaign just comes off as a bit desperate. It shows that AT&amp;T’s army of lobbyists is scared. The “CRA” that the tweets mention refers to the Congressional Review Act resolutions that are gaining momentum in both the Senate and the House thanks to the [overwhelming](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/4/16846978/net-neutrality-internet-donald-trump-ajit-pai-fcc-democrats-advocates-election), cross-partisan public support for net neutrality rules, and the massive backlash to the FCC’s repeal of them.

The CRA allows our elected officials in Congress to block the FCC’s decision with a simple majority in the Senate and House. We’re currently just one vote away from winning in the Senate, and there are already more than 110 co-sponsors for the CRA in the House.

It seems that the giant ISPs that spent millions lobbying to kill the FCC’s net neutrality rules are getting nervous. But lawmakers could be easily fooled by this latest astroturf campaign, so it’s more important than ever to [**contact your Senators and Representatives**](http://battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf) and tell them not to fall for it, and instead to support the CRA resolution and restore the net neutrality protections that should never have been taken away in the first place.
