technology,"After learning my Senator (Thom Tillis R-NC) was one of the senators who helped create HR 1212 which will ultimately do away with Net Neutrality, I sent him an email. I got a response today.","My email: 

&gt; Mr. Tillis,
&gt; 
&gt; I want to strongly urge you to not support the ""Internet Freedom Act (HR 1212)"". Doing so will ruin the Internet as we know it. Without Net Neutrality companies like Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon will be able to control what websites you and I get to see. 
&gt; 
&gt; The whole idea behind Net Neutrality is that all internet is treated equally, that is true internet freedom. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you pass this bill you will effectively allow Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon to control the internet. They will no doubt put profits ahead of customers. This bill would allow ISPs to limit the amount of bandwidth going to websites unless they pay a fee. 
&gt; 
&gt; This will greatly stifle the growth of small business, especially those who do a great deal of business on the internet. 
&gt; 
&gt; I voted for you last election and was so proud to say I had voted for you. But I am afraid that if you vote to pass HR 1212 or a similar bill, I will not vote for you next election season and will make sure everyone knows you voted to give control of the internet to big corporations. 

[His response](http://i.imgur.com/BhyZggN.jpg)

Text of his response: 

&gt; Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding net neutrality.  I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.
&gt; 
&gt; Net neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISP) will be required to treat all data traveling over the networks equally, rather than allowing ISP's to customize service offerings with their users and compete for more customers on the basis of quality and price.  It essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the Internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the Internet, which is why federal courts have already slapped down the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) twice before when attempts were made to impose net neutrality mandates in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; As you may know, the FCC recently voted in secret to adopt net neutrality mandates and reclassify broadband Internet access services as ""telecommunication services"" under Title II of the Communications Act.  This would allow the government to regulate the Internet under the same rules designed for ""Ma Bell"" in 1934, which hampered innovation and growth for more than fifty years.
&gt; 
&gt; I support a governing framework for the Internet that allows more competition, more innovation, and more freedom of speech.  I believe that less government regulation, not more, provides for the best opportunity for the Internet to continue to be a major source of innovation and economic growth for the United States and the rest of the world.  When the issue comes before the Senate, I will carefully consider everything you have said in making a decision on what is best for North Carolina and the rest of the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me.  It is important to hear from citizens themselves on issues that affect the state and the nation.  Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other important issues
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; Thom Tillis
&gt; U.S. Senator

TL;DR: If you have puush.daemon.exe located in your AppData/Roaming/Puush folder, delete it and scan your PC.

Edit: Puush.daemon.exe is also located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Puush, delete that as well, and make sure to go to your task manger, processes, and kill anything that has puush in it.

Edit 2: Puush has released a new update that removes the malware.
