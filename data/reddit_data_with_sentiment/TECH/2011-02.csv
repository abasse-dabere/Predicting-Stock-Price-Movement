technology,"Reddit, the dealership told me that pirated music (played via iPhone and auxiliary cord) had corrupted my car stereo system. How is this possible?","Note: I'm not the owner of the car, I'm writing on behalf of them..
I immediately told the owner this was impossible, but in the face of having to pay for it, I needed someone to back me up (happened while the car was in my possession).


I've used my iPhone and iPod many times before in the car with an auxiliary cord. We have Sirius satellite radio, which is accessible by pressing [AUX] three times (as you cycle through the three satellites). If you press it once more, the ""Line In"" mode comes on. I left it on Line In for about a week or so without touching the satellite radio, and then found that when I pressed [AUX], it would not leave Line In, and nothing would happen. 
The dealership asked me if I had used an iPod with pirated music, and said that the pirated music likely contained a virus which had corrupted my car's computer for audio, disabling satellite radio. 
How is it possible to transmit anything other than audio via an auxiliary cord?
The system needed to be taken apart and 'cleaned and reprogrammed'. 

Edit: They are clearly screwing with us, taking advantage of older, even less tech savvy people than I.

-I've told them to put the diagnosis of the problem and their summary of their work in writing.

-I'm considering reporting them to the BBB.

Anyone with a relevant background have any idea what could be wrong? It is just the satellite radio that is having a problem, and Sirius has been contacted but they need us to set it to a certain channel in order to resend the signal, and the satellite options won't even appear. The only abnormal thing which occurred recently was that the battery died in the cold overnight last week..



Update 2: 

Spoke to a manager over the phone (with the owner present in the room with him) (who knew nothing of the technical sort, and insisted for a short time that I did in fact transmit the virus from my iPhone via aux..)
He got a little bit soft-voiced and told me that the original technician (who had provided him the information) had gone home, and that I could speak to him tomorrow if I liked.


He backtracked and stated that I could have transferred the virus via USB...I told him that a USB connection wouldn't allow me to play my iPod, and wasn't relevant anyway because I had used an auxiliary cord..
I'm going in tomorrow to talk to the original technician. 


Update 3:

I've now been told that the original estimate was $150, and the invoice we received was for $282..Not impressed.
The write-up said that a virus was transmitted via USB, and in person they've indicated the area to the rear of the gear shift which houses the AUX plug-in and stated that it was from an iPod.




Update---Friday Feb/11


The manager (whom I was told was in charge of putting the job in writing and pricing everything) was not in. I spoke to the original technician who said that what he says goes straight into the report on the invoice, but when I showed him mine, he said it was not what he had found. 
Service summary reads (sic) (will post picture when I get home):
Report cause of satellite inop 

After USB port used

Diagnose removed virus from system reprogrammed ok

Labor: $249.88 

($130 higher than original estimate)

The technician stated that Fords run on Microsoft, and the antivirus is programmed to freeze when it detects a virus in a foreign object (ie song or picture on my phone), and that it detected this through the Aux cord when it ""communicated with and read my phone"".
He claims there was no virus in the system but that I ""could imagine how bad it would be had it not frozen and let the virus in"". Also told me this is very common and in fact he had two in today.
I asked him for a print of the test he ran when he plugged into the system and for a copy of the error code/statement and he said there was none because the aound system didnt communicate with him at all. I asked him how he knew what was wrong and he simply stated because he does it all the time, and he knows. 

When I asked him what was done, he told me that he had ""disconnected and reset the APM and then reprogrammed"". I found it weird that the OS's antivirus would only deactivate the satellite radio and not the line-in capabilities, after it supposedly had detected a virus via the aux input. 

I've been told to return on Monday and speak to the manager. Sorry for typos, I'm writing this from my phone.

You're wasting bandwith and I'm wasting time. It's a win-win situation for both of us! :D

**EDIT**: It seems a lot of people would like this to be an option. Reddit has voiced its opinion once before and thanks to this community the developers over there listened to us and we now have the Stop Downloading button.

Maybe they read this and decide to let registered users select what resolution they want all their videos to appear in.

The point is to have this built in, I'm aware of third party extensions.

Until Youtube fixes this, I've temporarily bitten the bullet and downloaded Firefox Beta 4 and installed GreaseMonkey + this script: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13333

technology,"Last week, a group of Redditors came to D.C. to lobby for Net Neutrality--the same week the House voted to repeal the FCC's Net Neutrality rules. So, this is the part where we ask for your help.","Gathering some kind-hearted volunteers, a few beers, and 15 pounds of construction paper, the members of the Open Source Democracy Foundation (OSDF) assembled [the Valentines messages **you** gave us](http://www.flickr.com/photos/58668334@N06/sets/72157625956140765/) to support Net Neutrality--you may recall the idea from [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fchoc/al_franken_has_cosponsored_a_bill_introduced_by)  The next day we met with the offices of Senators Al Franken, Maria Cantwell and Kay Bailey Hutchison to tell them how important this issue is to Reddit, the OSDF, and anyone else that uses the internet (read: everyone). All three very receptive and welcoming, but Franken’s staff truly LOVED the Valentines and assured us that the Senator would be reading a number of them. It was great to have a chance to talk with their offices and let them know we exist and that we care, but we know we can’t stop there. We know now that there is the potential for movement on this issue, but we have to get active and we have to get loud. There is much work to do and we need your help.

**Looking Ahead:** 
Maria Cantwell and Al Franken have [introduced a bill](http://cantwell.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=330533) that would go a long way toward keeping control of the Internet out of the hands of the ISPs, and beef up the FCC’s Net Neutrality rules, [which we believe didn’t go far enough](http://mashable.com/2010/12/22/reddit-pac-net-neutrality/). This bill will only pass if we can show support for it, and make our voices, not just the voices of Comcast or AT&amp;T, heard.

One of the things Franken’s staff mentioned to us was that they don’t get a lot of calls about Net Neutrality. We need to change that. We need help spreading the word about this issue. [An article last year](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/net_neutrality_opponents_outspending_proponents_mo.php) mentioned that Net Neutrality opponents were outspending our side by a margin of 4-to-1. There's been some [dubious polling](http://www.fair.org/blog/2011/01/03/bogus-net-neutrality-poll/) about Net Neutrality, which isn’t helping, either.  And just last week, the House [voted to de-fund the FCC’s enforcement of Net Neutrality rules in the 2011 budget.](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/144959-house-passes-amendment-to-defund-net-neutrality)

We also need to get businesses on board. The end of Net Neutrality means that a handful of companies will be able to dictate which sites we get to access, forcing us into an Internet caste system. If you run a web-based business and aren't able to pay an ISP’s toll, you will not get access to users.  These concerns aren't theoretical, [they're already happening (pdf)](http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/NetNeutrality_report_20101019.pdf#page=9). It’s not enough to have to have the support of people like Franken and Cantwell--we must be loud and enthusiastic of their actions and this cause. We cannot let them be voices in the wilderness.
