gadgets,Amazon's amazing customer service,"I won't frame this in a ""It's shit like this Amazon"" kind of way, nor will I post a funny comic about it. Call me dull. I just want to share a very positive experience I had with Amazon customer service. 

I spent this spring in the US, where I bought a Kindle DX (from Best Buy, not directly from Amazon). After moving back home to Sweden, the joystick stopped working, so I called Amazon customer service. After 5 minutes of waiting (when was the last time you got through to customer service that fast?), I got to talk to a customer service representative. Here I was expecting all kinds of trouble (warranty not valid outside US, having to ship the unit to the US to have it fixed, having to send it to a friend in the US and having them go to Best Buy with it etc). However, after less than 15 minutes on the phone, they put in an order for a brand new Kindle DX to be sent to me, in Sweden, with priority international shipping, no charge at all for me (they even pay the import fees, which are fairly high in Sweden!), leaving me very, very impressed!

I wanted to share this because I believe this level of customer service should be rewarded with positive word-of-mouth.

TL;DR: I bought a Kindle DX in the US, it broke in Sweden, Amazon will send me a new replacement free of charge, by priority international shipping. They even pay the import fees.",212,894,2011-09-06,TECH,0.0715227797627449,0.8848824501037598,0.04359472915530205
