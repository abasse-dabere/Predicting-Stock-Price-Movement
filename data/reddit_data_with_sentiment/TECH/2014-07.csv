gadgets,Best noise canceling headphones under $300?,"I will be taking a roadtrip from Chicago to DC (roughly 25 hours round-trip) with my dad later this summer for a family funeral.

Unfortunately, his girlfriend (think Sally Field's ""you like me!"" Oscar speech narrated by Miss Lippy) will be accompanying us, so I need something to help me forget she's in the front seat.

I'm looking for something not by Dr. Dre and under $300 because that's how much a round-trip plane ticket costs.

Edit #1: Whoa, thanks for all the info and ideas, everyone! Clearly I have a lot of comparison shopping to do this summer:)

Edit #2: I just realized that talking about a funeral in future tense is a little weird. My great uncle passed away recently, was cremated, is being buried at Arlington and my family decided to make a vacation out of it. He enjoyed traveling and always partied hard when he and my great aunt came to visit, so it seems fitting to do so in his honor.",341,366,2014-07-01,TECH,0.0433424636721611,0.9165350198745728,0.04012246057391167
