technology,The lifespan of a bullshit Wikipedia article.,"In January 2005 a friend of mine created a bogus Wikipedia entry in my name to be funny. I didn't find it funny since I did not want my name associated with Wikipedia vandalism, so I quickly used the intended form at Wikipedia to request a deletion, as one is supposed to.

My friend then created the same bullshit entry two days later, only this time he altered my name to give it an Italian ring to it. This time I couldn't be bothered to respond to his pranks, so I just left it there.

The article consisted of only a phew phrases of this made up person's life and career, it was both poorly written and chronologically unrealistic.

During 2006 it received one modification, a Wikipedian added a 
""biography of a dead person""-template on it.

In 2007 another person added a ""this article does not cite or reference any sources""-template.

In 2008 a Wikipedian added a link to the article on a page listing notable people with this surname.

In 2009 nothing happened.

This month the article was deleted by a mod with the reason ""Attack page or negative unsourced biography of a living person"" despite the article was clearly none of those.

The contents of this article is now spread greatly across the web on multiple pages describing notable historic Italian people and the like derived from the very limited content in the article.

The name is still listed on the ""notable people with this surname""-page.

So in conclusion, the lifespan of one insignificant, random bullshit Wikipedia article is 5 years. I wonder how long would it have been if one had put just an ounce of effort into it?",25,27,2010-08-05,TECH,0.06779765337705612,0.9094431400299072,0.0227592084556818

technology,The Google/Verizon proposal: the Hive Mind is wrong on this one.,"I'm getting frustrated with the lack of critical thinking going on when discussing the Google/Verizon proposal. I'm repasting the text of a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/cz5dz/today_google_announced_an_agreement_with_verizon/c0wdk3u) I posted in another thread, because I really think this perspective needs to be heard:

&gt;I think we have a lot of Chicken Littles reacting to this news.
&gt;
&gt;All the articles that speak out against this agreement are mostly just laundry lists of no-network-neutrality doomsday scenarios, and are not even attempting an unbiased discussion of what this proposal is actually saying.
&gt;
&gt;The proposal explicitly solidifies network neutrality for wired services, which is good. But it's true, this proposal does not cover wireless service: ""Because of the unique technical and operational characteristics of wireless networks, and the competitive and still-developing nature of wireless broadband services, only the transparency principle would apply to wireless broadband at this time."" Those last three words are important. This proposal is not advocating for wireless service network neutrality, but it also is not advocating against it. And perhaps most importantly, this proposal explicitly leaves the door open for discussing wireless service network neutrality in the future. So I think we should be able to accept this as a first step, then afterwards continue to advocate for similar practices to be implemented for wireless service as well.
&gt;
&gt;It also suggests that ISPs be able to have content and services specific to their subscribers, as long as it does not ""threaten the meaningful availability of broadband Internet access services or have been devised or promoted in a manner designed to evade these consumer protections."" I suppose people can be up-in-arms about that, but I think that's a reasonable target: ISPs can do what they want as long general internet access is not compromised.

People like jumping on the bandwagon when it comes to denouncing companies' policies on net neutrality, but it's leading to everyone freaking out over this proposal, while not bothering to think and talk about what it actually says.",110,141,2010-08-10,TECH,0.02975953184068203,0.9344711303710938,0.03576933965086937

gadgets,An idea: Instantly cool down your car before you get into it in hot weather,"Today its 103F (40C) in Texas.  One of the least pleasant aspects of this is getting into a car that has been sitting outside, it takes minutes for the air conditioning to get the temperature under control.

So I had an idea.  Connect a solar panel to an air compressor and an air tank and let it pump air into the tank while the car sits idle.  Then, just before you return to the car, release the air from the tank into the car interior.

Because of the sudden decompression of this air, it will come out of the tank very cold, hopefully cooling down the interior of the car rapidly.

Anyone have any idea whether this idea can work?  Questions:

* Will the trickle of power generated by the solar panel be able to drive the air pump (in the knowledge that it will have several hours to build up sufficient pressure in the tank)?

* What pressure, and what size of tank would be required to drop the temperature inside the car from, say, 110F down to 72F?

*update:* Many people have suggested that some cars, like the Prius, will run the AC using power from solar panels.  From my research this is incorrect, all they do is circulate air, which means that the internal air will be no cooler than the ambient external temperature.  It may help, but the goal of my proposal is to lower the temperature down to well below the ambient external temperature.",141,38,2010-08-15,TECH,0.018942467868328094,0.9277617931365967,0.05329567939043045
