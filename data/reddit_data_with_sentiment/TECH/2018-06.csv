Full statement [here](https://zenmagnets.com/public-releases/6-2018-6-years-of-battle-ends-in-victory/)

 Context: [reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2cntud/we_will_fight_until](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2cntud/we_will_fight_until_the_end_zen_magnets_is_now/) and [reddit.com/r/technology/comments/xinx7/zen_magnets_caused_0](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/xinx7/zen_magnets_caused_0_injuries_is_now_the_second/)

It's been a minute since our last update, so here's a summary: we sell shiny ultra-precise neodymium magnets balls that are fun, but are [bad for your health](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2012/cpsc-sues-zen-magnets-over-hazardous-high-powered-magnetic-balls-action-prompted-by-ongoing) if ingested. 

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission was bent on getting Zen Magnets and Neoballs off the market because they are a hazard to children, even though we never sold them as kids toys. We got sued for a mandatory recall, while at the same time the CPSC banned the entire product category nationwide for all ages. Every other US company settled or stopped selling, including the [Buckyballs](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/business/last-maker-of-strong-magnets-deemed-hazard-to-children-fights-safety-ban.html) company. 

As a rule of thumb, brawling a deep pocketed Federal Agency is an exercise in futility. ""Fuck it, we'll sleep with less regret,"" or so we thought. Because magnets are perfectly safe if not ingested, and the right to read warnings was worth standing up for. Oh, and the [CPSC lied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLwR81UyceE) about the injury data. (Worst case scenario, [f]unemployment means the steam library gets more attention ~_~) Admittedly, [](http://www.westword.com/news/shihan-qu-fights-the-feds-to-save-zen-magnets-9920778)really wanted to see the CPSC lose. 

Three [simultaneous](http://www.westword.com/news/shihan-qu-fights-the-feds-to-save-zen-magnets-9920778) lawsuits, multiple near-insolvencies, 500 pounds of [oven burnt magnets](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shihan-qu-zen-magnets-cpsc_us_599216a4e4b08a247276b0ea), and a blizzard of legal motions later, we've come out the other end scathed but alive - and as enthusiastic as ever. We've had more success fighting the CPSC than any company in 33 years by a long shot, and have made it this far in no small part due to the redditors that have supported us financially and morally, for whom we feel *so much* appreciation. THANK YOU!!

technology,Many AT&amp;T customers may have been defrauded.,"Wall of text warning ahead. 

TLDR: If you shopped at an AT&amp;T store between August-December of 2017, you may have been charged for a service in which you did not ask for or authorize called DirecTV NOW. 

In November of 2016, AT&amp;T unveiled a streaming TV service called DirecTV NOW. Fast forward to the end of summer/early fall of 2017. The product was not doing well and AT&amp;T gives their reps a coupon code to apply to give the customer the first month of service for $10. The way that the subscription flow in AT&amp;Ts system worked, reps could sign customers up for up to three DirecTV NOW accounts per card. After learning this, managers would have reps discount down products to offset the price of DirecTV Now and have the rep sign up the customer without their knowledge. The rep was then expected to keep the log in information and cancel the subscription before the second service month commenced. If the reps refused, they would be threatened with discipline for not matching expected numbers and some were threatened with termination. 

In December, an email was sent out to reps stating that the company was aware of what was going on and that they would not tolerate it anymore. It is now that I would like to remind you that the behavior was taught to reps by management and that the reps were coerced into this practice. After receiving that email, All reps, to my knowledge, abandoned the practice due to fear of being fired. We all thought it was over until investigators started dropping by stores in January. In March, reps who were slated to go on a trip to Florida for having stellar numbers the year before were terminated. Shortly after that, reps were told by union reps as well as AT&amp;T management that the investigations had seemed to be over. However, as soon as the Time Warner deal went through, reps across the board were fired. The only management fired were reps when the investigation started. Hundreds of employees have Either already been fired or are slated to be fired within the coming days. Those who were not fired were given final written warnings. Given the severity of firings you would think AT&amp;T would have notified customers of this, but you would be wrong. **ATT DID NOT NOTIFY CUSTOMERS THAT FRAUD MAY HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THEIR ACCOUNT** 
**THIS COULD EFFECT THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS**
