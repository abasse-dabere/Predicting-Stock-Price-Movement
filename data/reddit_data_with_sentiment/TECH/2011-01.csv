technology,"Why am I required to pay for both text *and* data, when all text is is a very small format of data-sharing? Is it a scam?","Textual messaging is more popular than voice calling these days. According to my intensely-researched wikipedia sources, the maximum possible text message size is less than a single kilobyte. So why the heck can't data and text packages be integrated into a single package? Why should data users—some that pay upwards of 25 bucks a month for *2 gigabytes* of data that they *may or may not use*—be forced to *also* buy a text plan, when if they send and receive 3,000 text messages in a month, the total amount of data transmitted is less than 6 megabytes (&lt;0.2% of their 2GB package)??

I know the obvious problem is that roughly 80% of cell phone users don't have internet accessible smart phones, so they're ineligible for a legitimate data package. But what I'm saying is why can't the pricing and data package size be revamped? Why can't there be a 500kb data package (for non-smart phone users) for 500 messages per month, a 2mb data package for non-smart phoners for 2,000 per month, and then a 200mb or 2gb data package for smart phoners *wherein text messaging is **included***??

Is it that the general public is simply too ignorant to realize/care that they're being scammed, *if only by paying just 10 dollars per month*, into sending and receiving mere megabytes every month, while data users pay only 2.5x more and are able to access 2,000 megabytes? And, conversely, why must the heavy data users be required to buy a text package as well, when their current data plan represents more than enough to cover the amount of data that they'll send via text?

Or is it just that I'm not well enough acquainted with the inner workings of text messaging to realize why it has to cost as much as it does? **I'm simply and truly curious about all of this, and, although my post is biased towards a scam, I'm definitely open for fair discussion and new knowledge.**

Thanks!

gadgets,Could I get some honest iPhone advice,"In my small town, Alltel is being bought by at&amp;t so I need to switch to a phone that is att compatible.  As of now, they are offering that you can get an iphone in march and I'm thinking of getting a 32gig iphone 4.  Now, this being the internet and all, and everyone likes to rip into iphones but I just bought a macbook pro and I'm thinking that the compatibility would be nice (maybe even get a mobileme account - if that's even a good idea).  My ipod also took a dive this summer so i was looking at an ipod as well, so this way my phone can just be my ipod (good idea?).   

I really don't mind not having flash and i don't think i'll surf the internet that much on my phone so i really don't mind it not being 4g.  I'd mainly be using it for the occasional app, texting and calling, and an ipod.  Now could i get an honest response on if i should get a droid or an iphone? i hate to say that i'm a fan of apple products, but they are just really user friendly.

Edit: already expecting downvotes for the word iPhone

Edit 2: Ok, i talked to at&amp;t today and they said I can get a free phone for now and then when the iphone 5 comes, I can switch then.  Thanks to everyone that replied, I honestly would have bought the 4 and then had to make a f7u12 comic when the 5 came out.  thanks again",218,54,2011-01-16,TECH,0.01880747638642788,0.9042905569076538,0.07690197974443436

technology,"IPv4 address space is depleted; IANA is working on the press release now.  The internet as you know it is ""full"" and the age of IPv6 dawns today.","Throwaway account.

I am a network engineer at a large ISP or hosting company you've probably heard of.  I have an inside source at IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  

Background:

IANA has IP addresses.  They give out huge blocks of 16 million IP addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (RIR's), which then dole them out inside their region (ARIN for the US and Canada, RIPE for Europe, APNIC for Southeast Asia and Pacific rim, etc).  These huge blocks of IPs are commonly referred to as /8's.

Once IANA hits 5 /8's, it triggers a doomsday allocation - one /8 to each RIR, and then the ipv4 internet (the internet as you know it) is ""full"".

Each RIR estimates 6-9 months reserve IPs after IANA is out.

Anyway, tl;dr: 
**that day... is today.**  Say goodbye to the IPv4 internet.

And if you're not IPv6 ready, you should look to that.  World IPv6 day is June 8th.",256,246,2011-01-21,TECH,0.039590444415807724,0.9327217936515808,0.027687791734933853
