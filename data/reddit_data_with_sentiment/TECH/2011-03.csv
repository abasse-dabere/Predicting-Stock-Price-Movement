technology,Twitter seems like 1 good post and 9 random responses taken out of context.  How can that be understood?  What am I missing?  How do you use this crazy thing?,"I've been a computer programmer for 30 years, love Facebook and Reddit, and I pick up new technologies pretty quickly but I don't understand how to use Twitter.

Here's a few sentences from Twitter's help pages:   ""Twitter contains information you will find valuable...reading Tweets and discovering new information whenever you check in on your Twitter timeline is where you'll find the most value on Twitter.""

I can't find anything valuable about Twitter.  I'm currently following 7 people and every now and then I see a witty observation but 9/10 posts are things like this:

@asdsdfg  Dude!! That's so funny!!
or
@qweqw3e  Sorry man, there'll be another time.


These seem like pieces from a thread... but why would you sort a forum thread by speaker?  I've seen forums on the Internet since the early 80's - that's fine, I get that.  But to dislodge the comments from their thread and display them without context just seems like random gibberish.  It doesn't at all match the description that Twitter promised in their help pages.

Is there a button I'm missing called, ""Show this in Context"", or something?  What good is twitter if 9/10 posts are not understandable?  I understand the ""one off"" observations, but I don't understand how people have conversations on Twitter.  I'd really like to hear how people are successfully using Twitter.

EDIT:  Thanks everyone.  I actually get it.  My primary mistakes were viewing other people's profiles (wondering wtf is going on) and not using the search tool which I assumed was for rare situations but actually seems to be a core function.",37,34,2011-03-02,TECH,0.046769704669713974,0.9223626852035522,0.03086761012673378

technology,I bought a WP7 device 3 weeks ago. I have never seen so much hate in my entire life.,"I bought a Samsung Omnia 7 phone. The deciding reason for me was the price as the phone had lost more than 40% from the original price (at online stores). I checked it out at a normal store and was impressed. Really liked how it looked and felt, so I bought it. That was 3 weeks ago... since then I've been under attack. People directly laughing at me, mocking me for being totally lost in the tech world, telling me what a huge mistake I have made and that I should give it back. EVERYBODY is explaining what a shitty product it is... forget the iPhone owners, even dumb phone users are schooling me... I feel like I work for Microsoft everytime I try to suggest that I actually like the thing and that it works fine for me, especially as I paid 50% less than what I had originally planned on spending on a smart phone.

I can't believe this shit. What the fuck is wrong with people these days? Can someone remind me, why everybody hates Microsoft so much?!

It's the same thing today where people aren't as outraged as they should be about these caps. 250gb is a lot? first of all, not really...if you watch a lot netflix and rent HD movies then you might be closer to pushing your limit than you think.

But again, just imagine if those 10gb caps had been in place a decade ago...would we even have netflix instant watch? would we be able to download games on steam so easily? would we be able to rent streaming HD movies? would the iPad even exist the same way it does?

If you were hoping on 1080p streaming being released by netflix you can already kiss that goodbye...but where does it end. Now that these caps are in place can the web really go up from here or have the ISPs forced us to a peak?

**EDIT:** Ok the attention is on them, lets go in for the kill. Should we start a facebook group of people that are AT&amp;T customers that will drop their DSL and Uverse services the day that the caps are implemented.

Lets really get moving on this, we have enough time to let our voices be heard before this shit starts so lets get organized.

Step 1: Let's come up with a good name for the facebook group...short, simple, gets the point across and says ""Fuck You"" to AT&amp;T in a polite (wont get banned or deleted) way.

once we have a name for the group i'll create in on facebook and make the graphics. from there we can start gathering support, i'm willing to even put in some ad dollars to get the group onto people's pages.

(Best TV + Best Phone + 35/35 internet) = $115/month (really good deal, as it's all bundled)

(Best TV + Best Phone) + 50/20 internet = $250/month (sucks since only the TV and phone are bundled)

(Best TV + Best Phone + 35/35 internet) X 2 = $230/month

Don't use a throwaway address because you can't presently change it within Diaspora.  Alternately you could use a [temporary address](http://mailinator.com/) and invite your real address after creating a dummy account.  If you want to be tidy about it, you can close your dummy account in settings.

**2.**  Everyone who receives an invite turn it around and **invite at least two more commenters**, then **reply to their comment** to indicate that the invite has been sent.  

**3.** In your [profile](https://joindiaspora.com/profile/edit), you can set **You: in 5 #tags**.  Make one of them #reddit.
