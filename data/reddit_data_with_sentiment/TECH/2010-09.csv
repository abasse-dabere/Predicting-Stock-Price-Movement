gadgets,I want to start an online comparison site for smartphones that's focused around features instead of specifications. Yay or Nay?,"Hi reddit.

I've been playing with this idea for a couple of weeks now and thought it would be a good idea to ask your opinion.

The idea is pretty simple. Smartphones are becoming more and more common, and people are moving from 'dumb phones' to smart phones by the masses. These people mostly use their phones for calling/texting/camera and that's perfectly fine when you own a $100 phone.

But what if you decide you're buying a $200+ phone with a huge contract attached to it? Consumers today have to choose between iPhones, blackberries, androids and windows mobile phones. All with their own pros , cons and applications. For example:  

* Someone needs to use his phone a lot in public transport; which smartphone has me the quickest/best application to look up departure time.

* Someone sends a lot of group text messages; which phone handles this in the best way.

* What phone has the quickest gps application so I can navigate easily when going from client to client?

* I'd like to control my server from my phone; which phone handles the most protocols?

You get the idea. It's easy to think of hundreds of other features people would care about before buying a (new) smartphone. 

The idea behind the website would be that anyone can submit a question they'd like to see compared on different phones. Other people can vote on these questions and the most voted on feature get's filmed the next day and uploaded to the site the same night. 

*But here's the catch*: People can submit any question they like. For example; I am cheating on my girlfriend and don't want her to find out, which phone allows me to put a password on my texts/emails/ims? Or, I just made a few nude shots of that hottie I've been dating, what phone has the easiest send-to-my-friends capability?

I believe this could play a huge role in the popularity of the site, seeing as people could ask stupid questions, have their friends vote on them thus leading a lot of people to the website.

That's the idea in a nutshell, ask me anything you'd like about the idea and I would love to hear your feedback!

**edit:** Something else I would want to implement is a like/dislike button that will be displayed underneath each feature-video. Users could than log in to the site, watch a video or 2 and like/dislike certain features. Over a certain period of time, the data collected could provide the user with a good recommandation for their next phone. 

**edit2:** To clear things up, I would film the features in 720p and all in related areas. For example; a shopping list application would be filmed in a supermarket. Want to check the daily traffic? Hello camera in a car in traffic.

**TL;DR: I want to start a smartphone compare site that let's people submit their own feature requests and let 's other people vote on them. The most requested feature(s) will be filmed and explained the next day and uploaded the same night. Any advice/criticism?**",89,64,2010-09-10,TECH,0.03412441909313202,0.9374645352363586,0.028411008417606354

I've spent 3 years working for a small computer shop doing repairs, and frequently needed a reference like this. There seemed to be no major effort on the internet to concatenate this information anywhere for free, so took it upon myself to go on the hunt. A year later I've moved on to another job with less hands-on work, and my enthusiasm and spare time available for this project has started to disappear.

I did this for people like you guys, and now it's time to ask for serious help. Reddit, help me share this with as many people as you can! And if you know of or have service manuals that I haven't been able to find, share them with me and I'll make an effort to add them to my site for all to have.

**Edit:** Holy crap, popular much? You guys took my site down! That's never happened before. :)

Tons of interesting questions and comments, I'll reply to as many as I can in between work today. Thanks to everybody for the votes, the comments, and in some cases new content :)

**Edit 2:** Thanks again to everybody for the support! I have quite a few manuals to add now and will sort it out as soon as I've got some time. I've had a fair few people ask about the best way to send me more - if you upload it to [Rapidshare](http://rapidshare.com/) or [PipeBytes](http://host01.pipebytes.com/) or [Megaupload](http://www.megaupload.com/) or somewhere and PM or email me the download link I'll get right on it.",212,1137,2010-09-15,TECH,0.061685122549533844,0.9086083173751831,0.02970663644373417

I was checking a few websites and ran across focalprice having a $99 tablet which had a bunch of bad reviews.  I sent it to my friend since when I mentioned it he asked where I saw it.  He then sent me the link above for a different tablet $1 more.

So, I'm not much on tablet technology, but $100 feels like there should be something wrong with it.  I figured if this was an awesome buy I would have already seen posts about it, but since I haven't, I'm a little bit worried.

Can someone tell me as to why this is selling for so cheap?
