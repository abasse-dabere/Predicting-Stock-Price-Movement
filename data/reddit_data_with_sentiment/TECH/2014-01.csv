gadgets,TV Help? | Non-Smart | LED | 40+ inches | 60/120Hz | &lt;$800 | Decent Audio | Recommendations very much appreciated!,"Happy New Year!

I know this has been asked, but I cannot seem to find convincing answers. I am searching for a new TV and plan to use it predominately for:

1. Video games on PS4
2. Netflix/Amazon Instant (via PS4)
3. Streaming video/music (via HDMI connected computer)

My preferred specs are:

- Non-Smart (to save $)
- LED
- 40+ inches
- 60/120Hz
- Less than $800
- Decent audio (I also have good speakers to hook up if needed)
- 2012 model or newer

I am not loyal to any specific brand and will not be mounting it on a wall. The PS4 eliminates my need for a Smart TV, but if you think I should get a Smart TV then please elaborate! Also given how I will use the TV, do you think I should go for 60Hz or 120 Hz (I know PS4 runs 60 frames/sec). Finally, can you recommend a specific brand/model that fits my spec criteria and will provide the optimal TV experience for my usage behavior?


I certainly appreciate your help. Please let me know if I should provide additional details!",12.0,8,2014-01-03,TECH,0.016503572463989258,0.9109741449356079,0.07252230495214462

gadgets,Logitech revue cam,"Background:

I bought the logitech revue and [web cam](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-HDTV-Widescreen-Video-Cam/dp/B0040QE98Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389416632&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=revue+cam) for my parents some time ago for them to be able to contact me from their living room (they don't really use computers) when I moved away. The revue used logitech's own video chatting software that was recently discontinued, leaving the webcam as a defunct product. Logitech was nice enough to offer a [replacement program](http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Revue-and-Accessories/Notification-of-Change-to-Logitech-Vid-Video-Calling/td-p/1015807) this year in which you could get a skype tv cam. Neither my parents nor I ever got an email about the program which ended on September 5th, and it wasn't until we were trying to use it this past Christmas that we discovered the camera no longer worked and found the program from a search. When I called logitech, they said that I could only get support for the product through email, so I initiated contact:

12/26
&gt;Our family purchased the logitech tv cam for revue specifically for being able to use it to communicate with family during the holidays. After finding on christmas that the service wasn't working, we researched the issue and found that the product was discontinued and there was a program to replace the camera.

&gt;We didn't receive any communication about this replacement program, and it seems the camera is still being sold online.

&gt;While outside the replacement window, I'm hoping to be able to have our camera replaced since this is now a useless product for us.

Their first response on 12/29:
&gt;We understand that you were not able to avail of the Logitech Vid - TV Cam for Revue Exchange Program. My apologies for the inconvenience that this may have caused you. My name is Zach and I will be more than glad to help you with your concern.

&gt;Evan, the exchange program details are as enumerated:

&gt;- Logitech Vid will no longer be available as of July 1, 2013.

&gt;- We recommend customers using Logitech webcams to switch to other free video calling solutions such as Skype.

&gt;- Customers using the Logitech TV Cam for Revue can exchange it for either the Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 or Logitech TV Cam HD, both of which are compatible with Skype, at no additional charge before September 5, 2013 via this online form: http://www.logitech.com/support/vidtvxcam


&gt;Unfortunately, as of September 5th, the TV Cam Exchange Program is now closed. I regret to say that as of the moment I will not be able to provide any guarantees with regards to getting the item replaced or refunded. However, I am still reviewing the case and will be seeking the assistance of a superior for appropriate intervention.

As of 1/2, I had still heard no follow up for the ""case review"" so I pinged them again:

&gt;Per Zach's update, he was ""still reviewing the case and will be seeking the assistance of a superior for appropriate intervention."" Still waiting for an update on this.

On 1/3, I got an update:

&gt;Evan, my apologies for the delay as having the case reviewed again does not come easy. As much as I want to reconsider, I was actually informed that the end date for the TV Cam Exchange Program was until September 5th only and is unworkable. I certainly understand your concern as you have mentioned that you've had the product for quite some time now. I do not want to simply deliver the bad news as I hate to see good customers go but I am afraid as of the moment the best I can provide are these special offers. My sincerest apologies.

&gt;Special Offers:
&gt;http://www.logitech.com/en-us/special-offers

&gt;We hope you have found this helpful. If you have any further questions please feel free to reply to this email and we will get back to you shortly. Thank you once again for contacting Logitech Customer Care.

My response on 1/3:

&gt;Zach,

&gt;Thank you for being upfront about the circumstances and suggesting the alternative (though glancing at the special offers page, I'm not seeing anything that is relevant to my issue and if there is anything available, a direct link to the product would have been nice.) While I don't want to direct any hostility toward you as a support rep, I would like you to relay to whomever was involved in this decision the extent of my dissatisfaction:

&gt;I have been a loyal consumer of logitech products for well over 5 years. I am currently typing this email using a G15 keyboard and mx518 mouse (the second one I've owned.) I have two squeezeboxes (another discontinued product), have given one as a gift, have a logitech joystick, headset, headphones, universal remote (have also given this as a gift), and the list could go on. As I work in the tech industry and frequently converse with others about tech products, I take any opportunity (of which there have been many) I can to recommend logitech over other vendors.

&gt;I bought the revue and accompanying camera as a gift for my parents the christmas before I moved away from home as a way of being able to stay in touch with them during the holidays. This was a very special and meaningful gift, as I have always been the ""tech support"" go-to of the family, so using my knowledge to give them an easy way to get face time with me and my siblings had special significance for them and myself. To be honest just writing about it makes me somewhat emotional.

&gt;This season I was actually lucky enough to be home for Christmas, but my sister, who was celebrating her first Christmas with her newborn daughter, was 2000 miles away. My family was very excited to be able to witness the newest member of the family enjoy her first Christmas; only to get an error message when we tried to initiate contact.

&gt;But never mind the sob story; let's just look at this from a business perspective. I have an account with logitech with an associated email address. I'm not sure if this product is registered to my account or one I made for my parents since I don't see a way on the site to check registered products. This should be irrelevant though; for an action by logitech that would render a product purchased for ~$150 utterly useless, a proactive communication should have been sent to all logitech account holders regardless of their notification settings. What's more, as previously mentioned, the products is still being sold on amazon and perhaps in other stores (http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-HDTV-Widescreen-Video-Cam/dp/B0040QE98Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388779480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+revue+cam) so it seems there is no ongoing effort to truly recall the product (I wouldn't be surprised if there were several purchasers of the webcam this holiday season who are SOL due to the confines of the replacement program's limitations.) For something that gets as infrequent use as a webcam to have its replacement program advertised by something as subtle as a forum post and have an arbitrary replacement time-frame appears to be nothing more than logitech's attempt to replace the minimum number of devices necessary to maintain the illusion of loyalty to its customers.

&gt;On that note, I will not be purchasing any of the products on your linked page (which, after a second examination, has nothing relevant to this ticket and was just a further waste of my time.) Furthermore, I will make a point of never purchasing a logitech product again, and will consider it a service to friends and family to warn them against their own investment in the logitech brand.

&gt;Thank you for your time and assistance. You may close this ticket.

&gt;Best of luck in the new year.

It wasn't until just today (1/10) that they responded again:

&gt;Evan, thank you for your patience with the product. I do understand where you are coming from totally respect your decision. Though I am saddened with the outcome, I would still like to know if there is anything else that I can do to be of service? I understand that this has not been a pleasurable experience but if you have further concerns in mind, please do not hesitate to let me know as I am as eager to help.

gadgets,Looking for advice on a wireless keyboard (and other tips) for my dad.,"Hello!
My brother and I are upgrading my father's computer. He got out of a bad divorce about a year ago, and moved to our college town about five months ago and loves it here, but he spends most of his time at home with our aging dogs. My brother got him a phone with tethering ability, and I'm doing the computer upgrade, where I'm going to connect it to his TV and add a harddrive with his old music, movies, and tv shows that he lost (schizophrenic mother burned everything of his she could). Anyway, I'm looking for advice for a wireless keyboard (preferably bluetooth) that would be easy for a farsighted person to see, and hopefully have a trackpad or something to replace the mouse. Preferably, it would also be cheap (my job is starting 2 months late this year because of lack of snow). 

I'm also looking for any other tips that could be useful, if anyone out there has done upgrades like this, such as an OS that could be good for youtube/webbrowsing, media playback, and.. well, I think that's about all he'd do, but I don't want to just throw on any linux distro without recommendations (my brother doesn't know linux, and he visits more often than I do). 

Thanks ahead of time!

TL;DR Need advice on a low priced bluetooth/wireless large key'd keyboard with trackpad for farsighted dad, and also a tech-illiterate friendly OS for web browsing and media playback.",4.0,8,2014-01-17,TECH,0.041612591594457626,0.9184077978134155,0.03997965157032013
