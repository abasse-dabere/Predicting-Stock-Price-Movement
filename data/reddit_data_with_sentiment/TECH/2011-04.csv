I've seen fake virus scanners before, but I was quite impressed by how well it's made. I know that curiosity killed the cat, but I was kind of intrigued where this would lead people who are fooled... I have Windows 7 64 and Security Essentials, both with the latest updates. So I downloaded BestAntivirus2011.exe and scanned it. No result. So how bad can it be, right?

**It holds your PC ransom and prevents the execution of ANY other program until you pay for it!**

Security Essentials got killed off, couldn't even launch the task manager!!!

More information / screenshots: http://www.2-viruses.com/remove-ms-removal-tool

I eventually got rid of it thanks to Safe Mode with Networking and Malwarebytes, but how many % of the average internet user would manage this? I think many would just pay up...

There's more things that I don't understand:

- How come Visa / Mastercard don't ban such a company?

- I've since scanned it with Virus Total and it didn't get identified by ANY Anti Virus software...

A penny for your thoughts, Reddit...

gadgets,"My mom thinks shes being spied on, is this stuff possible?","She has complained for awhile about this guy spying on her. But some of the things she says are really hard to believe, for example.

- Sees light flashes in her room at night, sometimes on or around her like someone is controlling them.
- Claims to see shadows/figures moving about out of the corner of her eye, or things in reflections moving (shadows/figures on a cell phone reflection for example).
- Says light reflections from lamps/light fixtures change because of cameras.
- Claims little nicks out of the corner of a wall look like his house so he must have done it.
- All of our windows and doors are bugged

This guy she claims has all this setup is a guy who asked me if I had a spare PlayStation cable, and by that he actually meant an Audio/video cable. He did go to college, so I'm not saying he's dumb, but it was for diesel stuff.

We have an alarm system setup, even painted the house. Everything I try to tell her she tells me I don't know what I'm talking about and she gets frustrated, I've even seen her cry because I didn't believe her. Even when I try to talk out loud to her about it she pulls the ""SHHHH, he is listening to everything your saying"" thing. 

That's why I'm asking the good people of reddit. Does this seem crazy? What should I do to help her?

Several times she comments that she is being watched and it seems like every little thing wrong everywhere in the house is some kind of high tech spy technology. Now I took some IT classes and I'm by no means stupid with technology, I just know nothing special about updated spy gadgets.

I understand OLED to be more efficient ect, but in regards to thinness a regular LCD laptop screen is much thinner! For example, you can buy a 15 inch LG OLED tv for around £1,300 that's 4.3cm thick, but a 17 inch HP laptop display 1-2cm thick will only set you back around £100? Obviously a more bulky base will have to be integrated for all the inputs ect, but that's also the case for OLEDs!

technology,Why do record labels do this with digital distribution?,"**Worldwide release discrepancies.**

This is just fucking stupid now. I live in the UK. We're not a **completely** backwards little country. Yet we get all manner of entertainment products woefully late. An example:

- I see a single due to be released April 12th by an artist I like.
- Now, I still buy CDs of albums I like, but for a single in 2011 that is overkill.
- I think ""okay cool, let's buy this digitally"". I check out several different music stores and see dates between April 20th and May 20th. WHAT.
- At this point, I'm at a break. I either wait for an extra one to four weeks knowing that a pirated copy of this single *will* be floating around online, or I pirate it because I want to hear it.
- I tend to opt to pirate it. Once I have a digital copy I find it difficult to remember or even consider paying for it - especially as it's the distributor who dicked around that will get most of the money.

These are **DIGITAL FUCKING FILES**. They do not take weeks to manufacture and ship around the world. Do these people not know that if they don't get their shit together, their product will be pirated before they've even had a chance to make a sale?",51,89,2011-04-10,TECH,0.03822813183069229,0.9286154508590698,0.03315639868378639

https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IreeBoKzfMoq24FHad79DA?feat=directlink

Hey reddit,
For my senior project I decided to built a CNC router. I've always liked technical things and I thought this would be a cool project for me to do. My high school requires every student to complete a senior project prior to graduating. The project can be either community service, curriculum extension, or career exploration. I chose curriculum extension and extended on my Materials Processing and Machine Programming course.


The machine is built using the Joe's 4x4 Hybrid CNC plans. (http://www.joescnc.com/themachines-hybrid.php) Check out both machines he has designed, they're pretty cool.
I have used it to work on a few projects, so I haven't had a chance to work on it in a while. I just wanted to share my project because I put a ton of work in to it and I thought someone here might appreciate it.

I received a lot of help from the internet community on this project. The designer of the machine gave me a free set of plans, and shipped all of the aluminum extrusion (~$300 + shipping) to my house. Other users from the Joescnc forum sent me motors, the HDPE motor mount parts, and other various elements of the project. I could not have done it without these guys! They made my dream come true and helped me work on something I was truly passionate about! I really hope that some day I can pay forward their generosity.
Anyway, I hope you guys like it!",21,49,2011-04-25,TECH,0.017721382901072502,0.9161244630813599,0.06615413725376129
