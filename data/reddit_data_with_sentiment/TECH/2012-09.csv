gadgets,Logitech customer service,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I just want to mention my recent experience with Logitech.

I bought a G9x mouse quite a while ago and used it for a good long while. It began having issues. I eventually figured out that it works perfectly on wood, but it fails on a mouse pad. 

I wrote to them asking if it's a setting or something and asking for instructions on how to fix it.

They sent me a new mouse, free of charge. Remember, this is a $60-70 mouse.

A year or so later - I notice that the replacement mouse is starting to have issues with the scroll wheel. Finally, the wheel just completely detaches. I send an email asking for advice on opening and fixing the problem. 

My new mouse is in the mail.

Even before my mouse issues, I've nearly always bought Logitech because my experiences with them have always been good and their equipment has always been fantastic. I've seldom had to deal with their customer service because their stuff generally doesn't screw up for me.

When I finally get faulty equipment, they prove that their customer service is amazing. I'm not happy, or course, that I had to use their customer service, but their response makes me love them even more.

I may be sounding like a fan-boy, but when a company goes this far out of their way to make my experience perfect, they deserve it.",128,310,2012-09-08,TECH,0.03624570369720459,0.9092080593109131,0.05454621464014053
