gadgets,"Hey, r/gadgets, you guys turned my random little invention into a full-fledged business a year-ago, which I now run full-time even though I'm just a 23-year-old drop-out -- so I'm really grateful. There've been a lot of changes to my product/business/website recently, and I'd love your feedback!","[Here's the original thread in /r/gadgets from 10 months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/saqvb/so_ive_invented_and_am_selling_fullsize_5/)

[Here's the crappy website to which it linked.](http://oldv1.rgft.net)

**[Here's the new less-crappy website!](http://www.thenoteboard.com)**

Within a week of that going up Noteboards were featured on TechCrunch, I'd gotten an offer from ThinkGeek, and I was scrambling to establish a legal business in order to not get in tax trouble, whereas the week before I was happily working a unrelated full-time HR job for a non-profit, expecting to maybe sell a few hundred Noteboards in a year, rather than a thousand in a week.

Last July, I was able to quit that full-time non-profit job and start doing Noteboards full-time. Since then, I've started selling them internationally, and have sold about 14,000 total. I'm still working all by myself from the basement of the house I rent with three other guys, and have learned a **lot** about business, taxes, patents, and all kinds of other crazy crap.

Now Noteboards have square-inch, square-cm, and hexagonal-inch grids on one side which makes them great for D&amp;D-type games — so just last weekend I went to a Con in southern Virginia to try selling Noteboards in-person for the first time.

Over the past few weeks I've completely overhauled the site (again). You can see the previous versions here:

* [Version 1](http://oldv1.rgft.net) -- the original, where this all began
* [Version 2](http://oldv2.rgft.net) -- not very different, but I was proud of the ""buttons"" on the side
* [Version 3](http://oldv3.rgft.net) -- tried pretending I was some legitimate business, instead of just a 23-year-old in his basement
* [Version 4](http://oldv4.rgft.net) -- a more Noteboard-focused version. I really like bright colors.
* [Today!](http://www.thenoteboard.com)

**ALSO**, now I'm donating a Noteboard to a good cause for every order I receive through TheNoteboard.com, which is what I really wanted to do from the start but couldn't afford till now. I've got 4 recipients so far ([you can see them here on the order form](http://www.thenoteboard.com/buy.php)), and hope there'll be more -- suggestions welcome!

I'm posting here again in case anyone has questions about Noteboards, or the experience of creating a business by the seat of the pants, or anything else. I'd also love some tips on how to draw attention to the new charitable-giving component. As an education wonk, I'd really really really like to see Noteboards going to schools and education programs, but I still can't afford to just give a bunch away.

TL;DR /r/gadgets got me a full-time job, and I'm extremely grateful.

EDIT: Massdrop's doing a deal where they're selling Noteboards for cheap! It used to be the main Tweet on the front page of my site, but I replaced it with the Tweet about sending Noteboards to charity. The deal's active for another 18 hours:
