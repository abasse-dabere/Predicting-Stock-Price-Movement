In February 2015, the FCC proposed a plan to reclassify fixed and mobile broadband internet as a “telecommunications service.” This new classification gave the FCC new authority to regulate broadband internet service as a public utility, thus, allowing the FCC to supervise broadband providers and take action if providers’ policies or pricing do not preserve the idea of a free and open internet. Then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said that his proposal would keep providers from blocking content, slowing delivery of select sites, or charging content providers a premium for faster delivery than other traffic. Allowing broadband providers to charge for speed could jeopardize this principle and allow a few large companies to squeeze out the startups, nonprofits, and consumers who cannot afford to pay an extra fee to have their services delivered at a faster speed.
 
The rule faced legal challenges from internet service providers and related trade groups, but on June 14, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the rule.
 
New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has now proposed a rule, entitled Restoring Internet Freedom, which would re-classify fixed and mobile broadband internet service as an “information service,” reverting to the classification that was in place before the 2015 rule change. This re-classification would eliminate the FCC’s authority to regulate certain aspects of broadband internet services, thereby eliminating many of the protections established by the 2015 Open Internet rule.
 
Ohioans increasingly live their lives online, and some communities have only one option for their broadband service provider. As consumers, we expect that the broadband services we pay for will provide unfettered access to an open marketplace of goods, services, and ideas. Chairman Pai’s plan would allow service providers to throttle back internet speeds and offer better connectivity to the highest bidder, restricting consumers’ choices and the ability for small businesses to compete. In an industry where consumers’ choice of provider is already limited, we must take steps to ensure that our access to content is not controlled by the service providers they are forced to rely on.
 
The FCC is accepting comments on the new rule proposal until July 17, 2017. If you would like to comment on the proposal, you can do so online at: https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=17-108&amp;sort=date_disseminated,DESC .
 
I will continue to closely monitor the FCC’s deliberations and should legislation related to net neutrality come before the Senate, I will keep your thoughts in mind.

[Here's a screencapture for cellphone data plans in México](http://imgur.com/yYobj7x), which show how carriers basically discriminate data use based on which social network you browse/consume.

I wanted to post this here because I keep finding all these mockups about how Net Neutrality ""might look"" which -albeit correct in it's assumptions- get wrong the business model end of what companies would do with their power.

Basically, what the mockups show... a world where ""regular price for top companies vs pay an extra if you're a small company"", non-net neutral competition in México is actually based on who gives away more ""free app time"". Eg: ""You can order 3 Uber rides for free, no data use, with us!""

Which I guess makes more sense. The point is still the same though... ISPs are looking inside your data packets to make these content discrimination decisions.
