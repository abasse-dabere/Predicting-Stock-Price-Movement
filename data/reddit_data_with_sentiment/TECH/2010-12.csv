I've been pretty upset about this ever since and wonder why they haven't gotten slammed for a truth-in-advertising violation. I feel that it is blatantly deceptive. Am I alone here?

edit: A few things

1. sorry I'm such a whiner

2. I would actually pay more if I had the option for a truly unlimited plan

3. I'm okay with the way T-mobile does things with regard to high consumers of bandwidth, its a tough solution to a sticky problem. I just wish they did a better job of disclosing the limits throughout their marketing materials. AKA I have no beef with the policy (mostly) but I definitely have one with the contradictory messaging.
