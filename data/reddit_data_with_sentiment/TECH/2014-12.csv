I login and back out a few times this morning while conducting some business. After a little while I open a new chrome window and start out at google.com. I notice that one of the 8 little website thumbnail previews that chrome generates (I assume based on the sites you visit most often) is paypal. The site says paypal.com but instead of a thumbnail from the page itself, it's a still image of me in front of my computer. I reset my browser and visited the site again. Closed it out and again then went back to google.com in fresh Chrome window. The same thing happened again, there's a thumbnail that says paypal.com but the image is a still shot of me. I'm not sure if there's some strange glitch going on or if PayPal is up to something fishy.

I am in no place to talk about politics or things like this. However, it's situations like these that we need to be discerning and must share. I have no idea how many people will see this post. I also have no idea what the future holds in store for us. The bill already passed the senate and the house, and now it's up to the president to veto the bill.

If anything else, please help sign the petition.

gadgets,[CONSUMER WARNING] LG 55UB8500 not as visually advertised,"Hey all, Looking for a place to put this and I've seen some discussion on this sub about 4k TVs so I thought you all might want to know about this. 

I've gone through the process of researching and purchasing a 4K TV recently and I have an issue with product in terms of what was advertised vs. reality. 

I bought the LG 55UB8500 UHD 4KTV off of Amazon for $1299.00 (the price has since risen to $1399.00, you can see the link [here](http://smile.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-55UB8500-55-Inch-Ultra/dp/B00II6VY6C/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418657982&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=55UB8500&amp;sa-no-redirect=1). Most notably, the images on Amazon show a TV with a very thin bezel approx. 2-3mm thick left, right and top. However, when the TV came, it had a much wider bezel of 10mm thick left, right and top. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/urlYDEA.jpg). Even the box it came it was slapped with the same ""bezeless"" [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/FLwqcXe.jpg) from the promotional material.

Now, I've called both LG customer service and Amazon technical help about this issue. 

For LG, pretty much everyone I talked to had no idea what a bezel even was, and when finally they understood, they looked at their own spec sheet and said that the bezel of this unit is spec'd at 10mm thick. Low and behold, when asked to locate that information on their website, everyone said that it was not listed. 

For Amazon, they at least sort-of knew what was going on and told me that yes, I was correct, and the visual material were not consistent with the delivered product. The only thing they could do about it was return the TV. They also say that they've flagged the page as needing an update. 

I have two theories about this discrepancy:

1. LG actually did a production run of the unit as shown with the bezel super thin and the coinciding promotional materials at the MSRP of $2,299.00 (listed on their website). Then, to drop the price drastically for sales etc. they did a second production run with the cheaper, thicker bezel, but neglected to change the promotional materials. 

2. A not so smart graphic designer took the promotional shots of the TV in its off state [seen here](http://imgur.com/a/NoNfr) and photoshopped the homepage content into them without the pertinent info on the bezel size. 

Other than this surprise, the TV overall is fantastic. Picture looks great, resolution is as promised, blacks look very good and off axis is very good in a dark room setting (glare from a window or light can make the off axis impossible to see).

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this issue or if they have any advice. But first and foremost I want to let people know about this since there doesn't seem to be adequate information online about it. 

Thanks a lot, if you have questions, I'll answer them as best as possible.  



**EDIT: So it seems like this is getting a little bit of attention so I'd thought I'd clarify a few questions overall:

1. I am currently able to get a full refund for the TV and have it returned to the Amazon seller free of cost. The questions for myself is whether to keep the TV as is, or go to a retail store to look for a replacement in my price range.
2. I have yet to find out if any products in this LG line were made with the extremely small bezel that they show. If anyone has any pictures or evidence, please post them or PM me. 
3. I am not rich. I do fine, and prioritize my spending. One of my priorities is having a top quality display in my living room, especially since I work in entertainment. I'm not really sure what this questions has to do with the original post, but a lot of people are asking so here I am.

I've been working today so I apologize if I've been slow responding to questions. Thanks for everyone's help and suggestions.",390,990,2014-12-15,TECH,0.04381568357348442,0.9234302043914795,0.032754071056842804

gadgets,Help? Sprint is keeping my iPhone 5S hostage.,"Hi all!

So I bought a Spring iPhone 5S last year with a 2 year contract. 

I decide to move back to Iceland about half a year after this. Now I realize this is a pickle when it comes to phone contracts and such, so I call Sprint and ask them what the best way for me to do this is. They tell me I need to pay $450 to get out of the contract and be able to use the phone in Iceland. They assured me that this was all I needed to do, that there would be no problems for me. I remember them being puzzled that I wanted to leave Sprint, but alas, there is no Sprint in Iceland. The lady on the phone understood this. I paid the fee, and then moved to Iceland.

When I tried to turn on the phone in Iceland, it just didn't work, the SIM was locked. It wouldn't connect to a network in Iceland. I called Sprint again and told them this, they said that I was wrong, that I wasn't doing things correctly. After a few very expensive phone calls, they tell me that I actually have to bring it to the store to be unlocked. But I already paid my way out of the contract? Doesn't matter. But you assured me that I wouldn't have to take further action? Doesn't matter!

This is all quite frustrating, but luckily I have someone coming to visit me from the states 3 months later, so I buy a shitty Nokia for the equivalent of $20 and go dumbphone for 3 months. I'm getting excited to get the iPhone back, and when my visitor arrives *3 months later* they have less than riveting news. 

They took the phone to Sprint, and the guys there said that the only way to unlock the phone was to connect to the Sprint network. The only way to do this, they said, is to sign another contract, with all the associated fees, unlock the phone, and then break the contract, with more associated fees. They're basically holding a phone **I already paid for** hostage until they get more money out of me! 

Does anyone have any advice at all to give? Someone suggested jailbreaking/unlocking but it's apparently impossible with Sprint phones. My iPhone is basically an iPod, and Sprint are not being helpful at all (to say the very least).

Help me Obi-wan-reddit, you're my only hope.

Edit: tl;dr Sprint promised to unlock my phone and made me pay a buttload of money. Didn't unlock phone, refuse to do so now, I don't have a phone anymore.

So I did get an unlock code from Sprint when I called them first, I maybe forgot to mention that. The unlock code was ""000000"" and they told me to take it to my local service provider and they could unlock it. I went to their IT department and they basically laughed at this unlock code, said they couldn't do anything, and that I should talk to Sprint. 

A Sprint employee contacted me through PM, and after a bit of back and forth, here is his/her final reply:

*The MSL code is all 0's. 000000. At this point since you no longer have Sprint service, Sprint would unable to assist any further. The other carrier would have to attempt to unlock it to work on their service. You can see Sprints policy at sprint.Com/unlock*

There doesn't seem to be a solution to this problem, and I'm out $450.",452,838,2014-12-17,TECH,0.06782414019107819,0.8987352848052979,0.033440615981817245

Earlier this week, Sunlight Foundation [released a study](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/12/16/one-group-dominates-the-second-round-of-net-neutrality-comments/) claiming that anti-Title II comments from a group with ties to the Koch Brothers “dominated” the second round of FCC commenting, beating out comments from pro-net neutrality groups like EFF and Fight for the Future. Now, [anti-net neutrality groups](http://www.americancommitment.org/content/conservatives-opposed-internet-regulation-won-fcc-comment-period-landslide) and [journalists](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/dirty-data-why-the-4-million-public-comments-on-net-neutrality-might-not-be-what-they-seem/) are seizing on this report to try to make it look like the public is against Title II net neutrality. The problem is, the FCC’s data was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments, and I can prove it. To make things worse, Sunlight’s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment while systematically ignoring pro-net neutrality comments. It’s a mess.

**Full disclosure:** I’m Jeff Lyon, CTO at Fight for the Future, a pro-net neutrality group responsible for driving 777,364 pro-net neutrality comments through the Battle for the Net campaign. I’m posting this here, along with all of our evidence, with the hope that Reddit can help us verify these claims.

**The FCC data dump was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments.**

The raw data [the FCC released](http://www.fcc.gov/blog/fcc-releases-open-internet-reply-comments-public) and that Sunlight used for its study was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments sent from Battle for the Net. I noticed this and emailed the FCC’s Chief Enterprise Architect, who confirmed via email that, of over 525,000 comments we submitted via CSV, _at least_ 244,811 were missing from the data that the FCC released (**[screenshot of email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/fcc_email_redacted.png)**). As of right now, the failure point is still unclear: did the FCC simply fail to export these comments, or did they actually fail to process them in the first place?

Worse, of the comments the FCC _did_ include, Sunlight found that 95,000 of them were duplicates—the same comment showing up multiple times, and this means an additional 95,000 of the unique comments we sent are missing. (I verified we did in fact send unique comments by examining reference numbers attached to them, can’t exactly prove this without violating our privacy policy)

Taking 244,811 + 95,000 gives us _at least_ 339,811 pro-net neutrality comments that are provably missing from the data. This is alone is enough to unseat Sunlight’s (methodologically-flawed) conclusion that anti-net neutrality comments “dominated” the second round, and the total number of missing comments is probably much higher.

Sunlight analyzed 1,674,385 comments and determined a 60 / 40 split between anti- / pro-net neutrality comments. They didn’t specify, but if we conservatively assume that 0% of the comments were undecided or ambiguous, then this amounts to 1,004,631 anti-net neutrality and 669,754 comments. Adding in the 339,811 proveably missing pro-net neutrality comments gives us 1,009,565, shifting the dominant group in favor of net neutrality (this margin would be increased if we assumed more than 0% of comments were ambiguous, and if Sunlight’s logic wasn’t completely flawed [more on that soon]).


**There are probably many more missing comments.**

The total number of missing comments is probably much higher than the number I’ve (thus far) identified. To help establish this, it’s useful to examine the different ways that people could submit net neutrality comments to the FCC, as well as the precise approach I used to determine these numbers.

In the beginning, there was [ECFS](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment_search/execute?proceeding=14-28), the FCC’s online commenting system. This system is over a decade old and melted down from the hundreds of thousands of comments sent through Battle for the Net and by fans of [comedian John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU) during the first round of net neutrality comments. (I believe on good authority that the FCC has just one server running the entire ECFS web site :)

The FCC soon realized that ECFS wasn’t working, and [started accepting comments by email](http://www.fcc.gov/page/fcc-establishes-new-inbox-open-internet-comments). However in September, right before the second net neutrality commenting deadline, the FCC made it possible to submit comments in bulk using CSV spreadsheets. Given the sheer volume of comments we were collecting through Battle for the Net, this option made the most sense in order to ensure timely delivery to the FCC.

Unfortunately, it seems that CSV option was unreliable. Over half the comments we submitted via CSV were missing from the FCC’s final data, and in Sunlight’s study, no comments were attributed to some other big companies that participated with Battle for the Net and submitted CSV comments on behalf of their users. If the FCC actually failed to process comments from these groups, the total number of pro-net neutrality comments would be even higher.

It’s also worth noting, the technique I used to determine the missing CSV comments is simplistic and only establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for the possible total missing. Here’s what I did:

* Battle for the Net submitted 527,952 unique comments via CSV to the FCC between the dates of September 12 and September 15
* Of these comments, 525,189 contained the phrase ‘We are writing to urge you to implement’ (people were signing onto an open letter from Senator Angus King)
* If all of these were counted, we would expect to see at least as many occurrences of that phrase in the [raw data](http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/R-14-28-02-SOLR-RAW.zip ) released by the FCC, but instead there were only 374,421 occurrences.
* Of these, 374,421 occurrences, FCC’s Chief Enterprise Architect confirmed via email (**[screenshot of another email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/emails.png)**) that 92,645 were from comments submitted through the FCC’s email address, meaning that 281,776 is the maximum number of comments possibly from the CSV files in their data, and they were missing at least 244,811.
* We only did a basic text search to arise at this number. If other people submitted comments with the phrase ‘We are writing to urge you to implement’, it would mean that _even less_ of our CSV comments made it into the final data.
* And of the 374,421 matches that were in the data, Sunlight confirmed that at least 95,000 were duplicate records, meaning that at least another 95,000 of the comments we sent are also missing.

We still don’t know whether comments submitted via ECFS were properly reflected in the FCC’s data. I’m running a full analysis, comparing our data to theirs, but it will take some time to complete.

**To make things worse, Sunlight’s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments**

The Sunlight Foundation studied the FCC’s data and concluded that comments from net neutrality activists were eclipsed by anti-regulatory comments from American Commitment, a known astroturfing group with ties to the Koch Brothers (they sent paid emails with misleading messages, but that’s [another story](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-conservative-anti-net-neutrality-movement-that-wasnt)). However, Sunlight applied a flawed sampling methodology to a flawed set of data, and drew conclusions that are impossible to make with any “reasonably representative” certainty.

In particular, of the 2.4 million comments released by the FCC, they ignored 800,000 comments that they couldn’t parse, and assumed these comments maintained the same distribution of pro- vs. anti- net neutrality comments. They’ve said the 1.6 million comments they did look at were “reasonably representative” of the whole group, but have provided no evidence to support that claim.

I’ve looked at the data myself. It’s extremely inconsistent, with comments in a multitude of formats, some plaintext, some XML, and many simply as concatenated strings with no delimiting characters separating them from one another. It’s generally very difficult to parse. However, it’s extremely easy to pick out and parse the email comments, as they tend to follow a consistent format.

The group of commenters that “dominated” the second round of comments (in Sunlight’s words) could have simply been the one organization that–due to the technique it used for submitting–didn’t get all its submissions garbled. In fact, it looks like that’s what happened. The FCC counted _all 92,645_ of the comments we sent via email, and failed to parse comments we sent via CSV. On the other hand, _all 777,364_ anti-net neutrality comments from American Commitment were sent via email, present in the FCC’s data, and counted in Sunlight’s study.

What this means is that, after Sunlight threw 800,000 comments away, half of their remaining sample pool of 1.6 million comments are easily parseable emails from American Commitment.

It is erroneous to assume that you can throw away a third of your data and that the distribution of the remaining data will be unaffected. Taking this further, Sunlight has publicly acknowledged a non-trivial difference in how they counted some comments from pro-net neutrality groups like Free Press versus comments from American Commitment.

All groups were effectively collecting signatures on a letter. American Commitment submitted them as a barrage of identical comments, while groups like Free Press submitted them as signatures on a single letter. The FCC says it recognizes and counts both. But Sunlight Foundation admits they chose to treat them differently, excluding multiple signatures on a single letter from the count.

This further confounded the result of their study in favor of anti-net neutrality commenters.

**TL;DR:**

* FCC failed to process hundreds of thousands of net neutrality comments
* Sunlight Foundation based a study on the FCC’s data, counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments. Concluded that anti-net neutrality “dominated”
* Political pundits and journalists are spinning this to say that the public is against net neutrality
* I wanted to get the facts out in the hopes that Reddit verify this, further analyze the FCC's data, and help figure out what's going on.",1704,7210,2014-12-19,TECH,0.10957265148560207,0.8668548067410787,0.023572544877727825

[Chicago City Data Meetup LINK](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoCityData/events/219239942/)

Chicago Public Libraries are one of the largest providers of free Internet access through its 80 locations in Chicago communities.   A center for digital literacy and 21st century workforce skills, they are a focal point for the city’s goal of making every community a ‘smart community’ in which everyone is able to fully participate in the digital economy.

All of this requires data.  And all of this produces data.  Please join us on January 7th to learn how the Chicago Public Libraries do both.  

**We will be Live Streaming this event from the Microsoft offices in downtown Chicago, IL.  All are welcome to join us.**

Chicago and Cook County represent nearly half the population of Illinois.  A large demographic out of three million people rely on CPL internet services to access the world... The decisions made by these librarians reflect the future of government, freedom, and privacy.

**Librarians have a strong reputation for promoting privacy.**  
Speaking alongside the CPL Data Manager and government officials from Cook County, we are excited to find out how one of the largest providers of free internet is planning to defend our rights and continue providing services that protect our privacy.",26,847,2014-12-28,TECH,0.01590071991086006,0.9139387607574463,0.07016047835350037

EDIT:
I spoke with someone from Comcast Executive Customer Relations. He wanted to discuss my complaint, but refused to be recorded. I record all of my calls with creditors so that I won't be promised something that is never delivered. As I found out yesterday, it might not even matter if the call has been recorded. Luckily this thread got some attention today, so I might actually get help with this issue. He assured me that I would change my mind about Comcast after speaking with him but I declined to continue the conversation. I've obviously learned my lesson today about keeping accurate records, and I don't want to hear anymore crocodile tears or pseudo-promises.
In any case, he said he would email me details of our non-conversation, which I will place here:

--
Hello /u/sweetlethargy, I regret not being able to consent to your recording our conversation due to  the nature of the reasons or possible intent that you may have for the recording. In reviewing the original and unedited version of your initial call, the agent gave you correct information on the service plan and promotional services at the time of the call. This is the product and service that you spoke about:

Internet Plus 09/06 - 10/05 69.95

Includes Limited Basic, HBO, Streampix, a
Standard Definition Digital Converter and
Remote For The Primary Outlet, and
Performance Internet.

Service Discount -19.96

Total XFINITY TV $49.99 plus taxes and fees

Franchise Fee 1.42

Utility Tax 2.00

PEG Access Support 0.28

State Sales Tax 0.16

FCC User Fee 0.09

Total Taxes, Surcharges &amp; Fees $3.95 (these vary slightly per month and are only collected by Comcast)
 
Docsis 3 Owned Mdm 09/06 - 10/05 0.00

Blast! Internet Svc 09/06 - 10/05 11.00

Service Discount -11.00

Total XFINITY Internet $0.00 (this was added after your conversation with the agent as a bonus) which may have caused this confusion

We have extended this promotional offer as a gesture of good will for an additional 12 months as long as you understand that at the end of that term if you wish to keep it, it will be billed at its standard rate.

It seems that they aren't accepting responsibility for anything, but they are offering me something. Here is my response. (All I want is what I was quoted):

--
Bottom line: do I have 100mbps down, 25mbps up, no contract, at $53.85 total per month including taxes and all other fees for 12 months?
--

Im waiting for a response.

For people who were asking, I used the android app Automatic Call Recorder by Appliqato. Everyone should record conversations with their creditors to keep them accountable.
(18:24PST)

**FINAL UPDATE:**

Just spoke with an ""Executive Customer Relations Supervisor"" who apologized for the actions of the two customer retention reps, as well as the Executive Customer Relations rep who refused to be recorded yesterday. She was very polite, took full responsibility for Comcast's mistakes, and allowed me to record our conversation. She explained that ""both representatives you reached were freshly out of a training class"" and they ""should've placed you on hold"" to get more information. This is strange, since I could clearly hear the second rep being coached on what to say... 

In any case, the Executive Customer Relations Supervisor said she would credit me a month of service as a sign of good will. She also explained that I would be receiving the promotional rate through August 15th 2015, however, due to the fluctuation of taxes and fees, she could not guarantee my final cost of $53.85. This month the final cost would be $55.55, for example. I indicated that all I wanted was the out-the-door $53.85 cost that I was quoted in August. I agree that the dollar amount is negligable, but all I've wanted is the price I was quoted when I agreed to keep the service. She agreed to credit my account $5 every month so that at no time I would be expected to pay more than $53.85.

Today I Learned that if Comcast pushes you around, the best course of action is to expose them on social media. I can honestly say that this has been easier, less time consuming, and less stressful to make and post the video than it would've been to dial 1-800-COMCAST again. I hope these Comcast horror stories continue to get posted so that something might change one day. Proper competition is the only answer to this solution, and I personally feel that public utilies should also operate as ISPs.

Everyone should be recording their interactions with creditors, as it is obviously the only way to keep them (somewhat) honest. It's sad that I was granted my simple request only after my video had been posted to the Consumerist, Techdirt, BGR, Gawker, yahoo, etc, etc... I realize that most people will simply never receive help with their complaints.

Good luck to all of you who are dealing with similar situations.

**tldr; I'm now getting what I was quoted: 100mbps down, 25mbps up, through August 15th, no contract, for no more than $53.85 per month.**

I had a conversation with support about this issue and they claimed that in my last billing statement, which I paid through their automatic payment system, on page 4 out of 10 they notified customers of the price increase. I think this is a clear price gauge with NO notification to their customers. I'm posting this to warn other about this price increase and urge them to file a complaint with the FCC.

Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions in my [last post](http://ud.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2qrj40/comcast_horror_stories_i_have_recordings_of_a/).

EDIT: Added link to previous post.

EDIT 2: tl/dr (sort of) upon request.
Basically, I called to cancel my service after already making preliminary arrangements for an install with ATT. A Comcast retention specialist then offered me what I thought was a deal too good to be true - 50mbps internet (for which I was already paying $59.99/mo) for $39.99 for 12 months. They were also going to cancel my bundled TV service since I didn't really use it anyway.

I grudgingly accepted the offer, called ATT to cancel their install, and waited for the Comcast confirmation e-mail I was told would arrive within the hour. It did not arrive.

I called back. The 2nd rep had no record whatsoever of the deal that was made on my first call. I informed them that I had recorded the call, so on to another retention specialist, who claimed to be able to match the original deal. I, again, grudgingly agreed. At this point, I was 2 hours in &amp; just wanted it to be over with.

After this, still no confirmation e-mail, and after doing a speed test, I saw that my internet speeds were now maxing out at less than 30mbps.

I called back.

The 3rd rep had no record at all of *any* of the previous calls. In fact, they showed me as being enrolled in a plan that was  **more** expensive than the one I had originally. So...over to another retention specialist. This one offered me the 50mbps internet for the aforementioned $39.99...BUT I had to bundle it with a TV package including basic + HBO.

I finally get off the phone after almost 4 hours, my speed tests are good, a confirmation e-mail finally arrives all seems well. I go to turn on my TV...no service.

I did not include this part in the video (though I do have the recording), but I called again and was told that my original cable TV box had been de-authorized when the plan was upgraded/changed/whatever, and that I need a whole new box. They offered to either ship me one, or send a technician to my house to install a new one. I declined both of these offers, as I simply do not trust that I will not be billed for these services. 

So, in short, several phone calls, several lies, several hours. Finally got working internet at the right price but the TV service is still not working, and I am so wary of rocking the boat and having them screw up my account again that I haven't authorized them to correct the TV issue...I simply don't trust them to not screw it up further.",93,629,2014-12-31,TECH,0.049101389944553375,0.9211183190345764,0.029780326411128044
