There is a lot of controversy over the, self admitted, crappy title I put on this post. I didn't expect it to blow up, and I was researching him when I figured I'd post this. My highest submission to date had maybe 20 karma.

I wish he didn't commit suicide. No intention to mislead or make a dark joke there. I wish he saw it out, but he was fighting a battle that is still pertinent and happening today. I wish he went on, I wish he could have kept with the fight, and I wish he could a way past the challenges he faced at the time he took his life.

But again, I should have put more thought into the title. I wanted to commemorate him for the very good work he did.

Company, I will call them ComRoad, owns all roads and charges consumers use of the road.   ComRoad notices that Toyota cars are the most common car on the road.   ComRoad also determines that if it was not for their roads why would anyone buy a Toyota.   They feel it really only makes sense that the Toyota motor company should be paying ComRoad directly for the cars that they sold consumers to have access to the road.   

ComRoad has also decided that they will have fast and slow lanes on their roads.   The use of the fast lanes will be determined based on how much money the company that made your car pays to ComRoad.

New car manufacturers can create the most innovative car ever thought of but if they don't have deep pockets and pay ComRoad then consumers really do not want the new car.",107,501,2014-11-18,TECH,0.014204882085323334,0.9069432020187378,0.07885191589593887

**-- “Comcast Trolls America Part I: How Comcast Grinds You Down” --**    
In October of 2014, legal counsel for Conal O’Rourke (a California resident) sent Comcast a letter stating that Mr. O’Rourke had [“simply requested, for the twentieth time, that Comcast stop overcharging him and correct his erroneous bills.”](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309785-20141002-orourke-reply-letter-final.html).  I (a Pennsylvania resident) have previously noted my own timeline of events detailing [25 unsuccessful attempts](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) to get Comcast to address problems with my account.  **From coast to coast, Comcast customers have been ground down in humiliating fashion.**


The purpose of CCTA Part 1 is to further depict the already well documented phenomenon by which Comcast customers are repeatedly passed from agent to agent, given conflicting information or misinformation, left on hold, hung up on, transferred to the wrong departments, all the while knowing that even if we possess the visceral fortitude to remain on the line for 30 to 120 minutes, we likely won’t get any resolution to our problem(s).  I created a video project to illustrate what I mean by “Comcast grinds you down” – Youtube link: [How Comcast Grinds You Down](http://youtu.be/WyqhBl7Lbv0).

* Amazon does not sell your data to anyone, it is only used internally to improve Amazon's services.

* Amazon never uses this data to advertise directly to you (i.e. no ""we heard you complaining about X, would you like to buy a new one?"")

**Comcastration:** Financial castration suffered at the hands of Comcast.
Can also be used as a verb: *“I can’t make my rent this month because I just got Comcastrated by $600 in bogus charges.”*


During the summer of 2014, when massive media attention highlighted how harrowing it can be for consumers to extricate themselves from Comcast, BGR’s Brad Reed quipped: [“Comcast’s brilliant new way to retain subscribers: Refuse to let them cancel”](https://bgr.com/2014/07/15/why-is-comcast-so-bad-4/).


Like [Ryan Bock](https://soundcloud.com/ryan-block-10/comcastic-service), [Aaron Spain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uoWzMOp8fQ&amp;feature=youtu.be), and countless others, I was confronted by a punishing Comcast cancellation process.  Even though I had already tried 15 times to get Comcast to address my non-working service, Comcast employees Ashley on 6/24/14 and Melissa on 7/4/14 insisted that if I cancelled my account, I would be charged a $960 Termination Fee.  At the time, I didn’t know that Ashley and Melissa were actually “Retention Agents”, expertly trained to carry out Comcast’s evil-genius *Refuse-To-Let-Customers-Cancel* scheme by which both the customer AND the Retention Agent suffer if and when an account is successfully closed.


Three weeks later, Comcast Executive Dave Watson [wrote in a memo to employees](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5926565/comcast-leaked-memo-reexamining-retention-call-policies) “I have tremendous admiration for our Retention professionals, who make it easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast.”  In light of my Comcast experiences, I find Watson’s comments to be disturbing.  What Dave Watson unsettlingly characterizes as making it “easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast” is in reality strong-arming consumers with heinous ~$1000 Termination Fees and then promptly delivering their bills to Collections, ravaging credit scores in the process.  Dave Watson – Comcast’s Chief Operating Officer - appears grossly unaware of how Comcast operates, or perhaps he is just openly proud of a coercive and reprehensible retention system.


**Being forced to agree to pay a $960 Termination Fee - for cancelling service that wasn’t working – was beyond demoralizing.  The next step in my separation from Comcast was equally disconcerting.**  As documented in my 8/13/14 [“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”] (http://redd.it/2dibwq) front page Reddit Post, I recorded myself returning all Comcast equipment, I got a signed &amp; dated receipt from a Comcast Tech, I was later charged $360 in unreturned equipment fees, I then spent 115 minutes on the phone unsuccessfully fighting the equipment charges (with Erica on 7/16, Joy on 7/21, and Dawn on 7/22), and then even after all that I received bills in the mail for the $360 in unreturned equipment fees on 7/30 and 8/6.  My “Comcast’s Notorious Fees” post generated 5000 comments on Reddit, many of which told accounts that were remarkably similar to my own Comcast Equipment Fees experience.


**Also noteworthy, [The Full 13 Minute Recording of my Comcast Equipment Return](http://youtu.be/B-sjjaz-CoM) suggests that Comcast employees are aware of Comcast’s propensity to wrongly bill for “Unreturned” Equipment AND to send bills to Collections.**    
**Point #1:** [During 10:55 through 12:45 in the recording](http://youtu.be/B-sjjaz-CoM?t=10m55s	), Comcast Tech twice suggested the possibility that I might be falsely billed for the TV &amp; Internet equipment, also advising me I should hold on to the TV &amp; Internet equipment receipt. Interestingly, by stark contrast, Comcast Tech felt confident stating that I would not be falsely billed for Home Security equipment: “You don’t need to worry about these [the Home Security Equipment]... that’s all gonna get turned in and just get removed from your account.”  Comcast Tech’s statements proved to be dead accurate: I **WAS**  repeatedly billed $360 for “Unreturned” TV &amp; Internet Equipment but I was **NOT** ever billed any fees for the Home Security Equipment (even though I returned all TV, Internet, and Home Security Equipment at the same time).    
**Point #2:** [At 6:50 into the recording]( http://youtu.be/B-sjjaz-CoM?t=6m50s), Comcast Tech very briefly made a reference to the unfortunate prospect of having a Comcast bill sent to Collections. I didn’t think much of his comment at the time, but I later read that for many years Comcast customers have been complaining furiously about terrible battles with collection agencies.  Comcast Tech’s passing reference to Collections is curious, especially in the context of compelling anecdotal and other evidence from customers (just google “Comcast collections bill” and/or read about Gary O’Reilly and Conal O’Rourke).


**During the past year, there have been [more than 160,000 comments about Comcast on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=comcast&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year).  The 160,000 comments TL;DR version: “We pretty much all f*cking hate Comcast”.**  The endless stream of extremely well documented nightmare experiences depicts practices that have gone on for years. Comcast’s behavior is so thoroughly systematic that Comcast customers like me began en masse to record and document all Comcast transactions in an absurdly arduous effort to not get screwed over.  Many in the media have suggested a “document everything and you should be OK” approach to consumer self-protection - but even that isn’t entirely accurate.  I had more documentation than any consumer could reasonably be expected to have – a signed receipt and 2+ hours of recordings – yet that was still not enough to avoid Comcast’s fee-generating system, nor was my documentation good enough to later get the equipment fees removed from my account.


**Comcast Fees and Collections are a vicious one-two punch.**    
-- I encourage The Verge to run another “Comcast Confessions” series to find out what Comcast accounting/billing employees can reveal about Unreturned equipment fees, Termination fees, and other miscellaneous fees.    
-- I hope someone or some organization might try to discern how much revenue Comcast generates from Unreturned Equipment fees, Termination fees, and other miscellaneous fees.    
-- I also hope someone will attempt to estimate the average and/or median income of Comcast customers, to show the context of how unconscionable it is for customers to be crushed by these fees.  (For example, someone who earns $30,000 annually would have to work roughly 100 hours at their job in order to pay off the $1320 in fees I faced after cancelling my Comcast account).    
-- And last, I applaud the ongoing effort by those who are currently investigating what I think might be **the most villainous phase of the Comcast system: wrongfully sending bills to collection agencies.**  Comcast has long devastated its customers’ credit histories by sending them to collections for bills that the customers don’t actually owe.  At this point, it would strain credibility for Comcast to claim that they are unaware of serious flaws in their accounting and billing practices. In light of mounting evidence that Comcast has neither the means to decipher which customer charges are erroneous, nor the ability to effectively resolve said erroneous charges, I call on Comcast to immediately suspend sending bills to collections until Comcast’s accounting and billing practices can be thoroughly investigated, audited, and then massively reformed.  The fact that Comcast continues to wrongfully send customers’ bills to collections agencies is extraordinarily callous and reeks of morally bankrupt leadership.


The Comcast system isn’t merely negligent and unethical - it’s downright vicious.

**Comcast Trolls America Part 3: Reddit’s Magic Wand**


I have great news for suffering Comcast customers – Corporate Comcast can totally fix your problems.  All you have to do first is get tormented so terribly by Regular Comcast that your story goes viral.


I and [Gary O’Reilly from Chicago](http://www.inquisitr.com/1504720/comcast-home-security-customer-service/)
 have similar Comcast stories.  We were both hit with a nearly $1000 Termination Fee for canceling Comcast’s Home Security.  Both O’Reilly and I first attempted repeatedly to get Comcast to fix service issues and when it became clear that Comcast was incapable of providing us with working service, we insisted that Comcast remove their service from our homes.


O’Reilly refused to pay his $1000 Termination Fee.  Comcast sent his bill to Collections which dropped his credit score more than 150 points. Even after Chicago Tribune got involved to help O’Reilly, Comcast still refused to remove his $1000 Termination Fee or restore his credit rating – unless he signed back up with Comcast’s service.  Ouch.


I, on the other hand, agreed to pay my Termination Fee (mine was $960) in order to get Comcast to cancel my account. Huffington Post later accurately quoted me as saying “I essentially agreed to pay $1000 just to not have Comcast.  How insane is that?” Insane indeed – and thoroughly disheartening when you consider that many customers cannot afford to pay such a prohibitive toll to escape from Comcast.  Even more preposterous, in addition to my $960 Termination Fee I was repeatedly billed for $360 in fake Unreturned Equipment Fees, which I have [previously written about]( http://redd.it/2dibwq).  **This means that when Comcast lost me as a customer, they instantly generated $1320 in revenue for themselves.  I remain both in awe and terrified of whatever evil genius concocted a plan by which Comcast generates enormous revenue by losing customers.**


Despite the obscene handling of my account, I was fortunate compared to many other customers: after enormous social media and news media attention, Comcast removed all fees from my account.  In the meantime though, Comcast’s protocol seems clear: continue to relentlessly punish those who aren’t fortunate enough to wave Reddit’s magic wand of justice.


**And thus the main purpose of this post:**    
For all the suffering Comcast customers who are not fortunate enough to make the news, here is something you won’t get to hear: Youtube video: [Five messages from Comcast Corporate in 18 hours – aka Comcast Pretends To Care Only After My Story Went Viral](http://youtu.be/dirB3GER-EM)

**Comcast Trolls America Part 4 - Non sequitur: Comcast Math**


**What They Say vs. What We See**    
In November of 2013, Comcast Corporation chairman and CEO Brian Roberts suggested in an interview that Comcast customers get a bad customer service interaction [“one-tenth of one-percent”]( http://consumerist.com/2013/11/22/comcast-ceo-blames-bad-customer-service-reputation-on-sheer-volume-of-calls) of the time.  In April of 2014 David Cohen, executive vice-president of Comcast Corporation, told The New York Times that Comcast does a [“great job on way more than 99 percent”]( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/business/media/comcasts-real-repairman.html?_r=0) of its service calls.


On DSL Reports, Karl Bode [promptly called Cohen and Roberts out] (http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Comcast-99-of-Customers-Love-Our-Customer-Service-128627) on their baffling claims, writing that “[Comcast] tries to pretend that they simply have so many customers, it's a small vocal minority of complainers that are to blame for the company's bad reputation, not the company itself:”


**Comcast Math:**    
I like math and I crunched some numbers using David Cohen’s estimate that
“Comcast does a great job on way more than 99% of service calls.”  By Cohen’s estimate, Comcast does a Not-great job on only 1% of service calls.  For simplicity’s sake, I’m going to refer to a Not-great service call as a “Comcast Fail”.


According to David Cohen’s numbers:


The probability of a Comcast Fail is 1 in 100.


The probability of [three consecutive Comcast fails] (http://bgr.com/2014/09/24/why-is-comcast-so-bad-20/)
 is 1 in a million.


The probability of [six consecutive Comcast fails]( http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/comcast-incompetence-inspires-more-painful-tales-from-customers/) is 1 in a trillion.


And the HOLY SH*T probability of my own Comcast experience – [25 consecutive Comcast fails](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) – is 1 in 100 quindecillion (a 1 followed by 50 zeroes).


*To recap, according to Comcast executive David Cohen’s publicly stated estimation, the odds that someone could ever have a Comcast experience like mine are 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000*


Has anyone ever experienced Comcast screw up more than one time in a row?  Please do share.  And if you’d like to crunch the numbers yourself, just calculate 100 to the power of N (where N is the number of consecutive Comcast fails).  For instance, if you’ve been through 4 consecutive Comcast fails, 100 to the power of 4 equals 100,000,000 (therefore the probability of 4 consecutive fails is supposedly only 1 out of 100,000,000).


**Mr. Cohen &amp; Mr. Roberts, unless you are actively trying to insult or antagonize your customers, the media, or really anyone who hears you speak, you should probably try a tiny bit harder when making up completely bullshit statistics about Comcast service calls or customer satisfaction.**


I like Math.  And I dislike your fictitious statistics.

**Comcast Trolls America Part 5: The non-apology apology**


* **Comcast, 2008:** “We are working hard to increase customer satisfaction.” [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/V3dCqBI), [Original source (Youtube video)](http://youtu.be/1a2R8wKfmHM?t=3m17s)


* **Comcast, 2014:** “We are working hard to make real improvements across the board.” [Source] (http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/a-public-apology-to-conal-orourke)


**From “We will do better” to “We’re going to get to the bottom of this”, Comcast’s stock responses have devolved from inadequate to abjectly insincere.**  After what we’ve learned about Comcast during the past year, their PR responses seem like a not-so-coy way of saying “Hey, it’s time you get the hint ... we really, really don’t care”, like they are irritated **at us** for forcing them have to pretend to apologize so much.


**On 9/9/14, Comcast Corporate sent me [this letter](http://imgur.com/J0lsZEc) confirming my account was closed and my $1380 balance was now magically $0.**  No explanation was provided as to why Comcast removed my $960 Termination Fee, my $360 in bogus Equipment Fees, or a $60 partial-month charge that I owed. My honest gut reaction?  For Comcast Corporate to arbitrarily drop the Termination Fee for one customer who made the news is to make a mockery out of every single customer who is stuck paying his or her cancellation fee.  Likewise, for Comcast to remove the Equipment Fees from just one person’s account is to make a cruel joke of every single customer who has to pay his or her bogus Equipment Fees or face a collection agency. If Comcast executives believed in the moral character and integrity of their company’s fee-generating policies, they might stand by those policies rather than frantically sweep them under the rug anytime the truth comes to light.


**Comcast Corporate’s 9/9 letter also noted “We would have preferred to speak with you live but please know that we are sorry for your unsatisfactory experience”.**  I genuinely feel (and I don’t think I’m alone) that the only thing many Comcast executives regret is that experiences like mine become public. As long as the company continues to treat customers in an obscene manner on a daily basis, Comcast’s “apologies” should only be defined as what they are - that most awful type of self-serving, empty apology that most human beings generally find to be enraging – the equivalent of saying “sorry” while simultaneously repeating the exact same bad behavior you’re pretending to be sorry for.


**And yes, Comcast, we all would have “preferred to speak to you live”.**     That’s why I tried 25 times. It’s why Conal O’Rourke tried 20 times.  It’s why Doug Dixon tried 6 times just on one phone call, and it’s why Aaron Spain waited on hold for 3 hour and 22 minutes, to desperately try to speak with Comcast.  It’s an exercise in futility that all too often sounds like these:    
*1.Youtube 1 (audio): [7/16/14 - Comcast Erica fails to remove my fake unreturned equipment fees - 42 minute call](http://youtu.be/w92f5ebZby0)    
2.Youtube 2 (audio): [7/21/14 - Comcast left me on hold for 15 minutes and then hung up](http://youtu.be/SRWAp85JVB4)    
3.Youtube 3 (audio): [7/21/14 - Comcast Account Executive Joy fails to remove my fake unreturned equipment fees - 43 minute call](http://youtu.be/893yS7rFrf4)    
4.Youtube 4 (audio): [7/22/14 - Comcast Supervisor Dawn fails to remove my fake unreturned equipment fees - 13 minute call](http://youtu.be/efgMV-KocFs)*


**Conclusion:**    
In a matter of months, Comcast has been declared “Worst Company in America” by The Consumerist, referred to as “obscene” by Glenn Beck, and “an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness” by Slate Magazine.


And every time we think it can’t possibly get any worse, it gets worse. We have now learned that Comcast contacted the employer of the now-fired Conal O’Rourke immediately after O’Rourke complained about [massive issues](http://imgur.com/xjY1LSQ) with his Comcast account. The prospect of Comcast calling our bosses is pretty much horrifying, especially considering that tens of thousands of us have complained about our accounts.  In October, Mr. O’Rourke’s legal counsel responded by seeking a court injunction barring Comcast from “Retaliating against consumers.”  That very same week, Gary Rosen -- a Worcester, MA city council member who opposes Comcast taking control of his city’s cable service – remarked **“Maybe we can’t stop it, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t speak out.”** Mr. Rosen’s words left an impression because they echo my own sentiment regarding so many forms of injustice, while summing up my thoughts on Comcast exactly. Maybe we can’t stop it, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t speak out.

technology,Be sure to check your COMCAST bill!,"I did not read mine carefully enough and in October I noticed that there was a $9 charge for an 'in-active modem'.  I went and checked previous bills and saw that it started in early 2013 at $7 and 4 months ago it went up to $9.

I did not have any Comcast internet equipment, I own my modem.  I have a bill from January 2013 that does NOT list the 'in-active' cable modem, then months of ones that do.

When I reported their error they told me they could only refund back 60 days.  NOT the year + that they charged me for something I didn't have.  They claimed that accounts are 'audited' and they added the charge when mine was.

My guess is that 'audited' means 'Let's just put a random charge on there and see if he notices'.  I am usually better about paying attention to details, but I missed this one.

Edit:  Sad to see more than just me have fallen victim to this scam.  I thought it might be Comcast's way of getting me back because their installer did a shoddy job installing whole house DVR and the dangling splitter he left on the back of the house got struck by lightning and destroyed a TV and some Nics.  I took photos and recorded the tech who came out to check it, and when he said ""He should not have left it this way"" I knew I had them.  (recording is legal in my state).  

I figured this charge was Comcast trying to get their $937 dollars back.
So I get a measly few dollars back and they pocket over a hundred.

technology,"We need to make it clear to the FCC that we want Uncensored Net Neutrality, for user privacy and true net neutrality","**We need to make it clear to the FCC that we want Uncensored Net Neutrality, for user privacy and the free flow of information and ideas.**

The whole idea of only allowing ""lawful"" content in the current thinking of net neutrality supporters is flawed. 

**Why:**

ISPs will use things like [Deep Packet Inspection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection) to scan every bit of data for ""illegal material"" which can be exploited by large corporations filing copyright claims  on stuff they do not own and locking down what data your allowed to see. No more WikiLeaks, BitTorrent, or Pirate Bay ever again for Americans.They could also employ [proxy filters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Monitoring_and_filtering) and other technologies to accomplish their goals. The [MPAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America) is probably cheering like giddy school girls because of this. Corrupt trigger happy copyright organizations like the IOC and FIFA along with American companies will be able to censor almost any information they want.


To ensure privacy and protect the spread of uncensored information. Data from around the world passes through the US, so restricting the free flow of information will be a significant blow to freedom of speech worldwide. To protect the principles of a modern liberalism that our democracy is based on, information control must be decentralized and not in the hands of a powerful few. 

**What we need to do:**

We need to tell the FCC we don't want net neutrality for ""lawful"" content. We want it for all content to ensure decentralization in our democracy.  

We need to also tell the FCC that we want net neutrality to apply to all data transmitting companies including mobile providers, backbones, ocean cable operators, and ISPs.
