technology,"So what would we need to implement an open, decentralized alternative to Facebook?","We're sick of Facebook. We have a right to be: reneging on privacy promises, asserting ownership of our individual data, refusing to let us archive our own data or scavenge our friends' data. It's a big problem.

So why did we gravitate toward Facebook in the first place? Well, before Facebook, our ""online identity"" model was the Geocities model: simply create a website. But Facebook offered some great advantages over this model, such as:

* Standardized profiles - information is put in the same places on everyone's profiles.

* Searchability - a very easy ability to find someone's profile by name, city, etc.

* Centralized news feeds - this is Facebook's killer app, really: the presentation of a single page featuring status updates by all of your friends, and the ability to handle status responses in a threaded manner

* Metadata - the ability to tag friends in photos (and have those photos aggregated into albums for each of your friends), to ""like"" statuses, to tag friends in notes and to republish others' notes, etc.

* The ability for non-technical users to create an account and an entire page in an extremely easy-to-use and non-technical way

And... well, that's about it, really. Other innovations (Facebook apps, in particular) are neither new nor particularly interesting or useful.

In view of these advantages - what would we need, really, to build a decentralized model of Facebook? How do we implement the advantages of Facebook - discoverability, standardization of information, message delivery, and a clean and easily prepared presentation - in a way that we control?

I propose the following:

* A standardized personal information representation - probably an XML schema that holds all of a user's personal information in a standardized way. With the right renderer, the presentation of this information can end up looking exactly like Facebook's. But even better, the viewer of the information - i.e., the visitor of the user's profile - has complete control over the layout of this information, and can render it in a more pleasing way if desired. Better still, the standardization promotes automation - e.g., the automated synchronization of each user's contact information with your contact info database. (No more ""my cell number changed, please update your records"" email messages!)

* A centralized database with pointers to user profiles (e.g., to the XML files of various users posted at various points on the net.) This really needs to be *one* registry. However, it serves a very specific and narrow purpose: if you want to find the guy named Joe from Ypsilanti who you met at an event last week, it needs to point you to his representation (if it's public.)

* A security mechanism. Look, this one's much easier than anyone thinks. We've had RSA for over 20 years. Identifying certificates, and techniques for encrypting select pieces of information for access only by specified individuals, are quite well-conceived. We just need automated protocols that incorporate these techniques. If done well, this model vastly surpasses Facebook's security models - you have exquisite privacy control over *every* piece of information: every post, every piece of identifying information - and you can revoke it from anyone at any time.

* An information delivery mechanism. This one's a little difficult. Sure, every individual can have an RSS feed containing all of his or her statuses, and we can probably weave posts together in a ""post X is a response to status Y"" model. But if you have 500 friends, does your computer have to retrieve all 500 news feeds from each of your friends' representations? That's awfully inefficient. We will need a push mechanism: when you post a message, like a photo, etc., the information needs to be pushed into message boxes of all of your friends. It's definitely achievable in a standardized and decentralized manner. Hell, we could just fall back on email, with automated parsing and weaving to generate your news feed based on the received messages.

* Easy deployment. This is also easy - just sign up for a service that will help you create your representation and then host it for you.

In other words - we can ditch Facebook for a decentralized model. It will be complicated for a while, and compatibility issues will definitely arise - but the end product can easily have all of Facebook's advantages, and many more, with none of its intrusive and abusive practices.

All we need is the motivation. And Facebook is giving it to us with their terrible business choices.",651,1124,2010-05-09,TECH,0.04675232246518135,0.9267778992652893,0.026469746604561806
