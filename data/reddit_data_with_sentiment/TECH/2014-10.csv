gadgets,The Transition from iPhone (5) to Windows Phone (Nokia 1520),"So, first of all, I would like to say I'm writing this as a review of how I felt my device transition went. I'll summarize why, and my pros and cons, and my 'result'.

Why: I had the iPhone 5 for a good long while. I mastered that freakin thing. My phone history goes like this - Flip Phone &gt; Pre-iPhone Samsung Smart Phone (Samsung Monte) &gt; Blackberry Torch (&lt;3)&gt; Blackberry Storm (blegh) &gt; iPhone 4 &gt; iPhone 5. I missed the openness of doing-whatever-the-hell-I-wanted of my Blackberry. iPhone made me feel locked in as I watched my friends Miracast, manage files, and do whatever the hell they wanted with their respective devices. ""FREEDOM,"" my digital self cried. So then I researched.

I knew I wanted a bigger screen - I don't think I understood what I meant by that though. What ended up happening is I walked into a store and wanted to touch everything and see how it felt. I looked at the new iPhones (which didn't feel 'new' at all) and ended up looking at two phones specifically - the HTC One M8 and the Nokia 1520. They didn't have the windows version of the HTC in the store, so I just had the android to look at. It was nice, but I just wasn't into it for some reason. I think it was the Android operating system - I've just never liked the way it looked or handled. Windows Phone OS has always piqued my interest though, so I sat there for fifteen minutes playing with this giant 6"" screen. I even made the guy get me one out of the box in the back so I can see how it fit in my pocket (if you're a man, it fits). I walked out of that store with a gigantic Nokia 1520 and enjoyed my first week of it thoroughly. 

PROS: 

* Using and customizing the Windows Phone made me realize how limited I was with iOS in terms of how I wanted to look. It didn't give me so much freedom, however, that it pushed outside of the Windows Phone branding - which I actually appreciate. I WANTED it to look like Metro. I know it's a feature of Android phones to do whatever-you-want-with-them, but I wanted a semi-walled garden experience.

* File management. Oh man, I missed this. I plugged this thing into my PC, and dragged some files into a folder I created on my phone (Orphan Black episodes) ... and they were there! No iTunes syncing. This was glorious.

* OneDrive. 30 gigs of storage because I have a Windows 8.1 PC as well. This was fantastic and worked super smoothly. It was like having a huge Dropbox that I didn't have to install. A lot of apps manipulate OneDrive as well, which made it really handy. (A gig of X-Men Comics available to view through an app named Comicana - this was great)

* Dat Screen. More device specific than OS specific, but still worth saying. I wasn't used to the screen size at all. Six inches?! I was coming from my iphone 5 which FITS IN THE SCREEN of the Nokia. 

* Settings - I was surprised at how many things I could fiddle with. It was wide open! Again, coming from my walled garden experience with iPhone made this really pleasant. 

* Live Tiles. You don't know you want them till you have them. :)

* Also a suite of useful features - Data Sense! Battery Conservation! NFC! Oh how I have needed these things.

* Syncing across devices. Apparently with Windows 10, this will get even better... it's great right now. My computer and my phone are one being.

* Cortana. CORTANA. ...cortana. (Edited this one in because I forgot!)

CONS

* This one only kind of counts - it's too big. And actually it wouldn't be so bad if the Nokia 1520 didn't have sharp corners! ...Though it has been fun to poke my friends with.

* The apps were pretty terrible. OneDrive integration cannot overshadow the poor quality of the apps on this device. I was used to immaculate iOS apps, only to be thrown in with the sea of mediocrity that is Windowsland.

* The LACK of apps is pretty terrible - want Google Wallet on your Windows Phone? Too bad. Apparently they're having petty disagreements and Google has yanked it's quality apps from the device to some extent. Also, even if there were 'versions' of the apps I wanted, they were usually independently developed or in beta. They either didn't exist or were mediocre. 

* Everything is Harder - Hey, I got a text from Lauren! Well... to answer it I have to open the screen, go to messages, and then open the message. Not a big deal right? It was real annoying in light of what I did on iPhone - swipe the message to open it. The size of the phone multiplied my plight - one-handed walking use was impossible due to a lack of shortcuts. This ""Everything is Harder"" issue applies to a lot of things - little functional use-all-the-time apps suddenly became hidden behind a wall. Calculator. Flashlight. Messages. Do Not Disturb mode. Etc.

* App refresh in the background. For some reason I can't get this right. Everything seems really delayed - I've toyed with a bunch of different settings but nothing seems to be working out. Huge bummer... I feel like I'm always opening apps and checking on things when I used to just wait for something to pop up.

* Got an Xbone? It's not that great in terms of working with your windows phone. I've been unimpressed thus far - even streaming from your phone to your xbox isn't REALLY supported all that well. 

* Weird wifi problems - my phone doesn't liked the wifi I have at work or at home, but it's snappy and great on my friend's. Why, WP, why. 

CONCLUDING

I'm actually still within the return policy timeframe and I'm debating taking this thing back for either an iPhone 6, HTC One M8 WP, or ... some random Android device. The tradeoffs are a bit too much in terms of what I lost going to WP. It's been a nice change, and if it was a bit bigger I'd keep it as my mini tablet and go get another phone! But sadly it just doesn't seem to be working out.

EDIT: I went back to iPhone.",60.0,91,2014-10-06,TECH,0.06866621226072311,0.9004411399364471,0.03089263290166855

technology,Don't like your ISP? Run a high-volume tor node!,"Tor nodes can be configured to consume enormous amounts of bandwidth, so configure yours to be juuuuuuuuuuust under your monthly bandwidth quota. Every month. To the kilobyte. If they call you to complain, act like an idiot and tell them you must have a virus on that old dell which you have sitting in the corner for running quick-books when tax time comes around. Bonus points if you live with a small child, a very old technophobe, or a drama major, let them field the call. Get creative, stall by trying to sell them time in a tahoe time-share. Start hiccuping and tell them that you have to get off the call. Complain that you're getting ""the fear"". If you smoke, take smoke breaks during the call. Don't actually get off the phone, just say, ""Bob, sorry, listen, I'm having a smoke, could we just table this matter for a few minutes."" Try to find out a little bit more about Bob. Maybe he likes the same football team as you, maybe he is also a huge Mork and Mindy fan. By the end of the call you and him will be like old friends, and he'll just shitcan it and let you run that tor node forever.

This might make your connection a little slower, but they shouldn't be oversubscribing you anyways, so whatevs, and you'll be contributing to internet freedom, privacy, and be fighting censorship.

PS Don't run an exit node without taking proper precautions: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node-minimal-harassment

PPS Don't run a node at all, or perhaps run a node in bridge-only mode if you have a connection with less than 1mb to spare. I recently learned that such nodes can do more harm to tor than good.

technology,Will the Trans-Pacific Partnership create a world where secret security clearances will be required of everybody with an Internet job?

See [""The TPP Would Enroll More Online Spies""](http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/10/the-tpp-would-enroll-more-online-spies.html)

I ask because its clear to me that pending FTAs.will lead to a great many existing jobs in developed countries going elsewhere.  Even as growth stagnates in developed countries, the markets in developing countries will continue to grow for at least the next two or three decades, according to projections.  That is why the firms in developed countries want desperately to get into those markets but they lack the kinds of leverage they would like to have. A way for them to get more leverage is by having jobs to put into play as bargaining chips. See [Sanya Reid Smith, Legal Advisor and Senior Researcher, Third World Network - discussing TISA, the Trade in Services Agreement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_pPqnbXpA4) 

 (TTIP and TISA wlll result in large numbers of jobs of all kinds being privatized [following the GATS rules](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11103-2013-DCL-1/en/pdf) on [services privatization](http://www.iatp.org/files/GATS_and_Public_Service_Systems.htm),  the next step, will be for them to become part of the world trade system, in order to increase the trading leverage (""water"" its called) - lots of IT will be off-shored, shifted to low wage countries, also TISA will mandate that corporations be able to move employees around at will which will push wages in developed countries down by forcing many formerly public service jobs (such as teaching jobs) into a new globalized procurement and bidding system, leaving mostly core government jobs- where security clearances and security related matters justify their remaining in the US or EU. 

Looking forward a few years in Western society, particularly the US, with the exponential growth in technology limiting the numbers of jobs, I see that means of determining who gets the remaining jobs will be important for the maintenance of hierarchy. Having good credit and a advanced degree will be all important, as will having a security clearance, even for jobs as mundane as low level Internet workers.

Is that what society wants? Creating a surveillance state where everybody is afraid to have opinions of any kind (because that will economically threaten their means of livelihood- because  they will come into contact with surveillance software development, (since it will be pervasive in Internet software, devices and technologies) We should be aware that TPP, TISA and TTIP are leading us into a world where to get a decent job one will need a security clearance and the loss of freedom of expression and ability to participate in democracy that will entail.

We should do our best to speak up now, to avoid that outcome because its inconsistent with democracy and the functioning of civil society.",1.0,8,2014-10-17,TECH,0.05314233526587486,0.9146570563316345,0.032200563699007034

technology,Mayor &amp; County Administrator open to municipal broadband...,"Now what? I approached both of them today, separately, and discussed possibilities of municipal broadband. Both said we need to sit and talk. County Admin says he would love to offer all residents an alternative to the poor choice we have  locally (my post history will divulge that). 

My question is, can someone point me to a viable model for a public Wi-Fi net over a suburban municipality or incorporated town? I don't think laying copper or fiber is viable for our area, at least not to cover the county, but what about a network of WiFi repeaters blanketing neighborhoods, and interconnected at nodes that are wired to a central hub? 

Anyone know of any financial studies or something that I can keep watering the seed with? They're open to talk about it, I need something to get them a little bit further than interested, but nothing trying to sell them on it because that's for later (after they're so interested that they're ready to take action and spend political capital).

Dont get me wrong, I am a stunden and have only a small budget.

Also I don't need all these great home automation features (well I d love to have me, but no money for that)
I am looking for those kind of things that will make life easier, look good and don't cost a lot of money.

Here are a few examples of products I might get. All of them are simple, not super high tech, but add functionality or modern design to basic things.

technology,Why do carriers (US) give Wifi calling a bad rap?,"I used to have T-Mobile years ago and the killer feature for me was UMA, which was calling over wifi.  It was so clutch, I bought specific phones just to use it.  But that fizzled out for some reason.  ATT has their poorly implemented MicroCell, which is brilliant in concept.  It is the absolutely perfect technology, and yet gets no attention, no support, and barely works. ATT might actually get around to a proper Wifi calling rollout next year, but I'm not holding my breath. 

Everytime I see an article about this, the feedback is that by having Wifi calling, a carrier is admitting to their own shortcoming in their service coverage.  Why does this idiotic attitude persist?  Is this a lie being told to try to avoid rolling out this technology, or do people actually believe this and the carriers are ""afraid""?

Does this technology come with some kind of additional cost or complexity?  Are carriers afraid of having to tech-support someones bad Wifi connection when calls get dropped?

If you have a below grade basement in a house, or your house is buried in a heavily wooded area, your reception is going to suck and no outside cell tower is going to fix that.  Is this really the fault of the carrier?  I get full strength outside my house, but lousy coverage in my house.  Why would I NOT want to have Wifi calling?  

Why don't carriers understand that?  Or am I missing something?

That just seems so ridiculous compared to where the US stands technologically and culturally (internet usage wise) as this point.  100Mbps should be the standard ""basic"" internet by now for home. Heck, 1Gbps should be standard in all schools (some have 100s of people sharing much less than that)!   I know it's been talked about before, often, but wow, still irks me because it's so ridiculous.

technology,PSA: OpenDNS randomly censors the internet for anyone with a dynamic IP address,"**To anyone who has been using or recommending OpenDNS: If you have a dynamic IP address (you probably do), or if you use a VPN service, your browsing could be censored at ANY TIME.**

I've been recommending OpenDNS for years, and I've been using it myself for longer. It *seems* like a good alternative to spotty ISP DNS servers, and is less likely to go out if I ever switch providers for any reason.

However, I've recently learned that it will apply sweeping censorship to entire swaths of IP addresses, without the vast majority of users' consent.

The heart of the problem is that OpenDNS has a **parental control feature**. While this *may* sound like a good thing -- barring the fact that it can be easily bypassed by any kid with half a brain these days -- the issue is that it **applies by IP address with nothing but a free registration, and will never stop applying to that IP.**

In other words, let's say Overprotective Parent X decides that little Billy's development is being harmed by all those porn sites. And any site that hosts any adult content, even if it's user-submitted and not the intent of the site as a whole. And SFW sites about sexuality. And while we're at it, websites about video games, politics, religion, dating, shopping, and *news*. [These are all categories that OpenDNS allows you to block.](https://community.opendns.com/domaintagging/categories)

First, O.P.X. registers a free OpenDNS account, [right here.](https://store.opendns.com/get/home-free) It requires even less personal information than the likes of Google or Microsoft accounts do these days, which means they might as well be Anonymous V. Anonymoose for all anyone will be able to tell later.

Then, later, O.P.X.'s home IP address changes, because dynamic IPs exist. This likely happens frequently, *especially* if O.P.X. uses a mobile network. The settings are *still* on the old IP, and cannot be disabled or changed without contacting OpenDNS support personally, which in my experience, takes **days** to respond to such tickets. Now some other poor sap has O.P.X.'s previous IP *and* parental control settings.

Of course, O.P.X. is as persistent as it is stupid, and upon finding that the settings are gone, they set them again. But this time, **they install a dynamic IP sync tool, which automatically applies their settings to EVERY IP ADDRESS THEY'RE EVER ASSIGNED.**

The end result is that the parental control settings of a single user will *spread like a cancer through the entire IP range of your provider*, and anyone using OpenDNS within that range will **be unable to uncensor the web unless they can figure out what's going on *and* wait out a multi-day support ticket from OpenDNS.**

Which, by the way, might not solve the problem, because **OpenDNS will RE-apply the settings if O.P.X. ever gets that IP address *again*.**

**TL;DR: OpenDNS parental controls are assigned by IP address and enforced on ALL OpenDNS users with that IP. Can't be disabled by anyone but tech support, which takes days to respond to requests. Can prohibit innocuous websites just as easily as porn. Can be set up with a dynamic IP client to spread the settings like cancer to EVERY IP the user EVER gets, automatically.**

I've switched to [OpenNIC](http://www.opennicproject.org/) myself. It seems to work well as an alternative so far -- and *doesn't* have a parental control feature.",11.0,8,2014-10-31,TECH,0.0713183581829071,0.9076222777366638,0.021059397608041763
