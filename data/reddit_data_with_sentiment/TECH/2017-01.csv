As technology improves there's no doubt that this kind of technology will become more developed and more widely available and delve into audio mimicry and the ability to use someones likeness to recreate video footage with almost indistinguishable resemblance to an original/authentic source. 

How are we going to reconcile with the fact that this could be used for terrible evil? Perhaps not today, but in 50 years when this kind of thing has been more-or-less perfected, what's to stop a political candidate from paying an audio/video engineer from creating damning video/audio evidence of their political opponent? Or if someone in an industry (sports, entertainment, etc.) wants to discredit an opponent or competitor, from creating damning evidence against them committing crimes or saying terrible things.

technology,Comcast Responds to my FCC Complaint regarding 1 TB Data Cap,"I filed a formal complaint with the FCC and I just got my letter back from Comcast with their official statement regarding the 1TB Data Cap. Quoting from that letter directly:

*""In certain markets, Comcast has implemented a usage-based billing approach that relieves users who use less Internet data from paying the same price as heavier end users, while enabling those heavier end users to continue using as much data as they want without being subjected to a hard cap.""*

Taking a look at this statement from Comcast; let's digest this.
 
This statement from Comcast implies that people that use more Internet Data impose a burden to those that don't use that much Data. Stated Proof: ""...relieves users who use less Internet data from paying the same price as heavier end users...""
Comcast is now inflicting a double-standard and Data Gouging (#DataGouging) its users. Stated Proof: ""...while enabling those heavier end users to continue using as much data as they want without being subjected to a hard cap."" Here's why this is Gouging; We (consumers) were already able to use as much data as we wanted, without a hard cap. The only way we can continue to do this is to pay up to $200 a month. (I'll cover this later)
 
*""This pro-consumer policy helps to ensure that Comcast's customers are treated fairly, such that those customers who choose to use more Internet data can pay more to do so, and those customers who choose to use less, pay less.""*

The two statements above conclude the first paragraph. Let's digest this one now. First, Comcast states that this is pro-consumer; meaning that it has to be anti-business if it's pro-consumer. However, this is indeed false. These changes are not pro-consumer as it results in their consumers paying more for something they already had. Secondly, consumers that end up using 'less data' do not receive any kind of compensation for using less than the Data Cap. Thirdly, there is no Data Plan Option to have your cap set lower and pay a lower price; it just doesn't exist. The current Comcast Internet Plans are all set by your Bandwidth desire. If you want a higher download speed, you pay more for it. All their plans are Subject to the same 1TB Data Cap. (Go look - They all state the same ""An XFINITY Internet Data Usage Plan may apply."" terminology, and that ""Xfinity Internet Data Usage Plan"" states 1TB Data Cap) If it were a true pro-consumer plan, then we would earn credits for unused data (Like Google Fi Cell Service), we would be able to choose Bandwidth Speed separated from Data Cap. Meaning, we would choose a Bandwidth (speed) of our Service, and then a Data Cap. They're attempting to make their Data reflect the same of Cell Phone Service Plans which is a completely different commodity
 
*""Our typical XFINITY Internet customer uses only 60 GB or 6 percent of 1 TB per month.""*
 
First, there's literally no data to back up this statement from Comcast. I've requested it numerous times from Comcast and I'm never answered. However, now that I have a FCC Case open, I'll be responding to this letter via the FCC to request that information to prove this statement. I implore everyone here to do a small scale survey within your friends and family to see if this is anywhere near the truth. We all have a Data Meter we can check now, so you should be able to see what your using all the time now. I personally know 8 different people, some with familes and others living on their own, that always hit the 1 TB cap every month. Why? Because they stream from Netflix, XFINITY, Hulu, Amazon, and so on. A single mainstream video game is well over 60 GB, and they even go over 100 GB now. That's 10% of your Data Cap by purchasing and downloading one video game on your Console or Computer.
 
*""Those very few customers who wish to use more than 1 TB per month will be provided additional buckets of 50 GB for $10 each, with a total overage charges capped at $200 per month, or if they prefer to avoid unexpected overages, they can sign up for an unlimited data plan for an additional $50 per month.""*

This statement here is the one I have the most problem with. This literally states that I can have unlimited data (what I used to have) for another $50/mo. This is called Price Gouging and is illegal in the United States of America. Definition: Price gouging is a pejorative term referring to when a seller spikes the prices of goods, services or commodities to a level much higher than is considered reasonable or fair, and is considered exploitative, potentially to an unethical extent. (Source: Wikipedia) Why is it considered price gouging? Because my service is not being changed or improved to warrant the increase in price. Instead, they are restricting my service and then charging us more for the same thing we used to have for no fair reason. The amount of Data we use as consumers has no ill effect on someone else, or someone using less. 
 
The second issue with the statement above is that instead of Comcast stopping the 'overage charge' at $50 (the Unlimited plan fee), they'll exploit your overage and charge you up to $200. This is somewhat like bank overdraft fees; the business makes a considerable amount of profit here.
 

Words that are *italic* are official statements made by Comcast. If you disagree with any of these statements then I urge you to contact the FCC which is your right as a United States Citizen.",143,485,2017-01-21,TECH,0.041732532903552055,0.9227360188961029,0.03553145378828049
