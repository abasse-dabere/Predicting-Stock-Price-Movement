technology,Facebook and Google say they are joining the massive net neutrality day of action on July 12,"Representatives for Facebook and Google [have told](https://www.inverse.com/article/33835-google-joins-net-neutrality-day-of-a) multiple [reporters](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/06/tech-companies-to-join-day-of-action-protest-to-protect-net-neutrality/) that the web giants plan to participate in the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www,battleforthenet.com/july12)** scheduled for July 12th to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal foundation for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Vimeo, Private Internet Access, Mozilla, OK Cupid, Imgur, PornHub, Medium, and hundreds of other major sites are also participating.

We at Fight for the Future, one of the main groups behind the protest, have not heard directly from either Facebook or Google, but we’re glad to hear that these companies are listening to their employees and Internet users and will speak out for net neutrality with the rest of the Internet on July 12. In previous years these companies have often been on the sidelines of these fights, so we hope that they plan to do something meaningful in the spirit of the protest and educate their users about what’s at stake if we lose net neutrality protections that protect our online free speech, and give them opportunities to take action.

In the end, though, this fight will not be won or lost based on the participation of giant web companies. It's up to all of us to do our part and make our voices heard. **[Learn more about the protest and how you can get involved here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**",87,2238,2017-07-06,TECH,0.039380960166454315,0.9276525378227234,0.03296654671430588

A bunch more high-traffic websites just announced that they are joining the [Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com) on July 12. That's awesome! But you don't need to be a big company to make your voice heard on this day.

This post contains everything that you need to participate, whether you’re an ordinary Internet user, a video creator, or you run a popular website, app, or online community.

July 12 is a day when all of us will use every ounce of our online reach to educate as many people as possible about this important issue and how it affects them, and encourage them to take action.

Michael Beckerman (/u/Internet_Association) and Evan Engstrom (/u/EngineOrg) here.

Internet Association and Engine advocate for internet and tech policies that ensure the internet remains the amazing, free, and open place it is today.

Internet Association [represents](https://internetassociation.org/our-members/) leading internet companies. We like to say that if there’s an app on your phone or a website you visit often, they’re probably a member. We advocate for policies that foster innovation, promote economic growth, and empower people through the free and open internet – which is why we’re here today.

[Engine](http://www.engine.is/) is the voice of startups in government. We work with a community of innovators and entrepreneurs throughout the country to ensure that policymakers in Washington support the high-tech, growth-oriented startups that are driving our economy. Considering how many startups depend on the Internet to connect with customers and grow their businesses, protecting a free and open web is central to our mission.

Of late, that means we’ve both spent quite a bit of time preserving [net neutrality](https://netneutrality.internetassociation.org/action/). It’s hard to overstate how important net neutrality is to the internet ecosystem. If ISPs gain the power to become content gatekeepers and privilege their content over the rest of the internet, it could very well mean the end of the internet as we know it.

And so we can’t thank all of YOU enough for taking a stand yesterday during the Net Neutrality Day of Action yesterday. 

IA and Engine also work on a whole host of other issues like defending encryption and fighting back against patent trolls.

We’re here to answer your questions about net neutrality, tech policy, and of course, anything else on your minds.
