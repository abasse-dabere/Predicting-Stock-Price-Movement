gadgets,First impressions of my new Simple Nook Touch.,"It is noticeably wider than my Kindle, but quite a bit shorter.  The rubberized back and side bezel feels very good in the hand.
The touch screen works very well for everything so far.
There are three ways to turn pages.  Swiping or tapping the screen and yes there are physical button on the left and right bezel.  The buttons are barely raised ridges in the rubber and require a solid push to click.
The screen does not turn black at every page turn, the letters fade away and the new letters fade in.  About every ten pages or so it will do the full black page turn.
I honestly can't tell much difference between the screens.  The sharpness, contrast and level of glare is about the same as my Kindle.
The memory card slot has a dust cover which is flush when closed.  I like that they added this feature, but I'm not sure I will ever need additional storage.
Most importantly I already like it better.  Primarily because of the form factor, rubberized texture and of course the touch screen.

So before jumping back in the band wagon and getting a new one, I thought i'd see what other suggestions there might be? 

I'd want one that definitely has same functionality as an ipod touch.  I saw the Creative Zen Touch 2, looked pretty interesting, quite a bit cheaper and has GPS (which would be really cool to have).  But heard some not so great reviews on it. 

Anything i should be looking at? Thanks guys very much!
