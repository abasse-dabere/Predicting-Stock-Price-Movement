2013-08-11,EBAY,"FastCompany: AmazonFresh a ""Trojan horse;"" 20 more markets expected","In a cover story on Jeff Bezos and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FastCompany's J.J. McCorvey observes the company's new AmazonFresh grocery service (offered via its $299/year Prime Fresh free shipping plan) is a ""Trojan horse"" meant to give Amazon's broader same-day delivery efforts needed scale.
Amazon is also hoping its same-day infrastructure (replete with Amazon trucks) will increase its appeal to 3rd-party sellers (now responsible for 40% of unit sales) by lowering delivery times. Merchants already cite access to Prime as a reason for outsourcing fulfillment to Amazon (and giving a ~20% cut).

EBAY could prove a formidable same-day rival. Instead of building its own soup-to-nuts infrastructure, eBay is relying on dozens of offline retailers (inc. major national chains) to help handle fulfillment. Google is also dipping its toes into same-day.
Currently available in L.A. and Seattle, AmazonFresh is expected to expand to 20 more markets, including some international ones. SunTrust recently predicted an NYC launch will happen in 2014.
Also mentioned by McCorvey: Amazon is now able to ship items less than 2.5 hours after an order is placed; and wants to further lower than number; Prime now covers 15M+ items (up from 1M in '05); and Amazon is still ""evaluating"" how to use Kiva's robots."

Auctions -23.3% vs. June's -17.2%, but fixed-price (now a majority of sales) +20.3% vs. +18.9% and Motors +26.6% vs. +27.8%. ChannelAdvisor thinks eBay's new search engine (Cassini) is helping out. Are recent fee changes also helping?     Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) numbers were a mixed bag. Same-store sales tied to search ads grew only 0.6% Y/Y, down from June's 5.1%. But comparison shopping (inc.

2013-08-15,EBAY,eBay losses pared following TechCrunch report on Facebook's plans,"Down as much as 4.7% earlier today, eBay (EBAY
-2%) finished with losses only a little worse than the Nasdaq's after TechCrunch provided its own report about Facebook's (FB
-0.3%) mobile payments product.
Like AllThingsD, TechCrunch reports Facebook's product won't offer payment-processing for now, but will rather focus on auto-filling billing info using data already provided to Facebook (the new Google Wallet functions in a similar manner).
But while AllThingsD argued Facebook's service amounts to a PayPal rival, TechCrunch argues this isn't the case, and that Facebook's primary goal is to collect data about user buying activity that could be used to improve ad sales/targeting. Facebook has already made some moves in this direction.
The truth may be in between. Though a lack of payment-processing (for now) prevents Facebook's offering from being a soup-to-nuts PayPal alternative, a product that allows billing info to be quickly auto-filled could still lead to more mobile transactions being processed by PayPal rivals. That is, provided Facebook is more successful here than Google Checkout/Wallet."
2013-08-15,EBAY,Facebook working on PayPal rival; eBay shares slide,"Facebook (FB
+0.4%) confirms to AllThingsD it's testing an online payments product. A launch is expected in the next month or so.
Sources state the product, set to compete against 800-lb. gorilla PayPal (EBAY
-2.4%), will ""allow online shoppers to make purchases on mobile apps using their Facebook login information,"" and (like PayPal) will allow them to avoid having to constantly re-enter their billing info.
However, for now, the test is focused on simply ""creating a better mobile checkout experience,"" and doesn't tie in payment-processing (as PayPal does).
Facebook already handles payments for in-app game purchases and its Gifts product (among other things), and the enormous reach of its social sharing tools could allow it to quickly reel in many 3rd-party apps and (if it chooses to expand further) Web sites.
But PayPal has stared down competition from Internet giants before, and the network effects stemming from its 132M active users and many thousands of merchant partners make it a tough company to seriously disrupt. PayPal expects to handle $20B in mobile transactions this year, up from $14B last year."

+1.1%), no stranger to well-publicized complaints from disgruntled merchant partners and payers, has unveiled a multi-pronged initiative called Customer First it hopes will yield higher user satisfaction.
Among other things, PayPal is adjusting its risk models to result in fewer payments to trustworthy merchants being held up - an exec refers to this as ""[catching] more sharks and less dolphins"" - and is implementing a ""no fault construct"" for small buyer complaints regarding counterfeit goods. The latter move will result in PayPal absorbing $2.5M/year in claims.
PayPal also says it's giving employees more autonomy to tailor policies for individual customers, and is asking execs to ""spend a week on the front lines at our call centers to hear and deal with issues first hand."" PayPal claims its existing efforts have led to a 40M Y/Y drop in customer issues thus far in 2013.
PayPal chief David Marcus has been busy shaking up how the online payments giant does business since taking its top job in March '12. The latest moves come with PayPal facing competition from upstarts such as Stripe, and perhaps soon Facebook."
2013-09-05,EBAY,"PayPal revamps apps, adds new payment tools; reviews mixed","A major update to PayPal's (NASDAQ:EBAY) popular Android/iOS apps adds a slew of new features.
Among them: the ability to quickly place an order from a store's menu while waiting in line, and to view and pay a restaurant bill before a check arrives; a Shop tab that highlights nearby stores that accept PayPal, and allows users to ""check in"" and open tabs at them; offers from local businesses; and the ability to apply for Bill Me Later financing for purchases made through the app.
PayPal exec Hill Ferguson: ""Thatâs the thing that matters the most to [users]: if you can replace all the utility that a physical wallet has in the cloud â¦ thatâs the goal for us.""
""Powerful but baffling"" is how The Verge's Casey Newton describes the new app. While granting it may be ""the most fully featured payment app to date,"" he also criticizes UI inconsistencies and a confusing navigation bar.
Newton: ""Until the developers who are building digital wallets can make them simpler than physical ones, most of us will keep buying our smoothies the old-fashioned way.""
ReadWrite's Owen Thomas is more positive, arguing the app's offline payment tools have the potential to reinvent how PayPal is seen and used. ""The point of the app is no longer to complete payment for an eBay auction on the go: It's to get you to walk into a store.""
PayPal is already a mobile payments giant: it expects to handle $20B in mobile transactions this year, up from $14B last year. But it faces offline payments competition from Square, Groupon, and others.

Braintree has scored some high-profile clients, such as Uber, Fab, LivingSocial, and Airbnb, and is now handling $10B/year in transactions (PayPal handled $42.8B just in Q2). Last year, the company spent $26.2M to buy mobile payments/digital wallet platform Venmo.

2013-09-09,EBAY,"PayPal launches Bluetooth solution for swipe-free payments, check-ins","Beacon, a dongle that plugs into a standard electrical outlet, uses Bluetooth to communicate with retail point-of-sale systems from the likes of NCR and Micros (both of whom are PayPal partners), as well as to automatically check in store visitors who have downloaded a PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) app on their smartphones and opted in to the system.
PayPal foresees Beacon enabling in-store promotions, payments that require nothing more than verbal confirmation (a user is sent a receipt later), and the potential for retailers to act behind the scenes (one example: a drugstore filling a user's normal prescription after he/she walks in).
To address privacy issues, PayPal users are able to decline a check-in immediately after walking in, in which case no info is shared.
Square is trying to address this space via Pay With Square, but its solution isn't as seamless (yet).
Beacon has the potential to address a frequent complaint levied at PayPal's current card-free offline payment solution, which requires typing in a phone # and PIN: that it simply isn't as convenient as swiping a credit/debit card. However, old habits often take a while to change.
Last week, PayPal overhauled its mobile apps to give them a much stronger offline focus. And in May, the company revamped its PayPal Here mobile card reader/cash register solution."

Moreover, all major U.S. carriers will now be supported (instead of just Sprint), and a spokesperson suggests Google wants to bring Wallet to the iPhone.
Wallet is also adding the ability to send money to anyone in the U.S. for free via e-mail. Like the Gmail money-attachment feature announced earlier this year, the feature serves as competition for PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY), though it shouldn't affect the payments giant's merchant transactions. Also added is a loyalty card/coupons feature a bit like Apple's Passbook.
Bloomberg observed earlier this year Wallet had seen less than 10M downloads, even though Google had spent $300M to buy startups for it. The latest changes should lead to a pickup in downloads.
As part of its efforts to be carbon-neutral, Google is buying 240MW of power from a Texas wind farm, with plans to sell the energy on wholesale markets and to retire the renewable credits obtained. Google is now committed to buying 570MW of wind power altogether.
Jean-Baptiste Queru, the Google exec in charge of Android's source code, has left for a position at Yahoo. Queru is the third key Android exec to leave the team this year, after VP Hugo Barra and division chief Andy Rubin.

TechCrunch reported at the time Braintree was asking for $1B, a figure it considered ""unrealistic.""
Though Braintree's $10B/year transaction run rate is much smaller than PayPal, the company has been growing quickly and claims big-name clients such as Uber, Fab, Rovio, LivingSocial, and Airbnb.
Braintree also owns a popular mobile payments platform in the form of Venmo. Venmo's iOS/Android apps try to differentiate themselves through a focus on social sharing."
2013-09-23,EBAY,"Facebook launches payments autofill tool; PayPal, Braintree on board","As previously reported, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) mobile payments autofill solution won't handle payment-processing on its own, but will simply autofill billing info for 3rd-party sites/apps with the help of data already provided to Facebook (via Facebook Payments, should a user have relied on it). Payment processors take over from there.
PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the processors acting as a launch partner. So are two of its rivals, Braintree and Stripe. The WSJ just reported PayPal is close to buying the former.
To the extent the service makes it easier for mobile users to pay through a PayPal rival, it could still serve as an indirect threat to the online payments giant. That, in turn, arguably bolsters the case for acquiring a company such as Braintree.
For now at least, Facebook's main goal with the product appears to be the gathering of additional purchase data (previous), which it could later use to deliver targeted ads."

A merchant can apply for another loan after its balance is paid off.
PayPal says it will initially offer loans to ~90K merchants, and wants to limit the service to businesses with healthy cash flow. PayPal exec Darrell Esch: ""Our experience with the sellers gives us a great vantage point to make solid decisions.""

The service is aimed squarely at PayPal (EBAY

PayPal has fought off competition from Google and other big Internet names. However, Amazon has 215M+ active customer accounts it can leverage to make a dent, and (judging by the company's description of its service) might be able to offer better on-site integration than PayPal.
Meanwhile, PayPal, which added several new offline payment tools and features to its mobile apps last month (I, II), has just announced one more: the ability to pay by having a QR code scanned.

Accelerating growth - Q3 rev. growth of 24% topped Q2's 22% - and ongoing gross margin improvement - Q3 GM rose 240 bps Y/Y to 27.7% - are getting attention. Global media revenue ($5.03B) +9% Y/Y in Q3 vs. +7% in Q2, EGM ($11.05B) +29% vs. +28%.
Amazon's total Q3 paid unit growth was 29%, even with Q2, and 3rd-party sellers still made up 40% of unit sales. Active accounts +9M Q/Q to 224M after rising by 6M in Q2. Also, North American ""Other"" sales (dominated by AWS) rose 56% Y/Y to $1.01B.
At the same time, Amazon's aggressive spending isn't letting up. Fulfillment spend rose to 11.5% of revenue from 10.5% a year ago, and tech/content spend to 9.2% from 7.8%. TTM capex +$320M Q/Q to $4.59B.
Interestingly, eBay (EBAY
-1.6%) is lower even as Amazon soars. When contrasted with Amazon's figures, eBay's Q3 Marketplaces numbers and Q4 guidance point to further share losses on a relative basis.

But the firm also believes U.S. mobile e-commerce sales rose 26% to $5.8B. That's a pickup from Q2's 24% clip, and gives mobile an 11% share of total U.S. e-commerce spend. comScore thinks mobile sales will be near $9B (+25% Y/Y) in seasonally strong Q4, and have ""an outside shot of hitting $10 billion."" 62% of Q3 mobile spending is believed to have come from smartphones, and 38% from tablets.
Recent industry commentary has been mixed. eBay (EBAY

-5.1%), which sold off in July following a report about the U.K. test, is diving again.
For the time being, only service providers are able to sign up. It looks as if eBay wants to do a gradual launch in an attempt to address the chicken-and-egg problem eBayHire is bound to initially face. Like Angie's List, eBay plans to let service providers establish profile pages were they can list services and provide rates, and also plans to sell ads that will appear alongside search results.
As eBay itself can definitely vouch, unseating an incumbent online marketplace with a large installed base of buyers and sellers is no easy task. But even moderate success could be enough to exert price pressure on Angie's List. Angie's is only six weeks removed from doing a membership price cut test."

eBay has created screens measuring 10' by 10', and recently set up three units at a San Francisco Westfield mall that sell products from Sony, Rebecca Minkoff, and Toms. Westfield says it could install the screens at other malls (it has 100 globally).
eBay, for its part, is looking to place the screens inside retail stores, and has filed patents related to the concept. It receives a cut on sales made through the screens, and also gets paid whenever a shopped clicks on a product.

comScore forecasts U.S. holiday season e-commerce sales (both PC and mobile) will be up 14%-17% Y/Y, even though retailers have six less days to work with (26 vs. 32) than in 2012.
Amazon plans to cope with the shorter season partly by starting its Black Friday promotions a day early. eBay, meanwhile, plans to waive the $5 delivery fee normally attached to its Now same-day delivery service, and to also offer longer hours for delivering Now orders made with retail partners."

Cyber Monday sales are tapped to see +20% Y/Y sales growth.     The ongoing channel shift away from brick-and-mortar becomes even more pronounced when auto, restaurants, and gas are backed out of retail sales tallies. Apparel sellers are forecast to be the hardest hit, although on-trend names such as Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Macy's (NYSE:M), Gap (NYSE:GPS), and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) should outperform.     The strong Cyber Monday rush could hurt foot-traffic reliant chains such as TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), Ultra Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA), and DSW (NYSE:DSW) - according to some trends dug up by Placed.com.     The positive read on e-commerce sales bodes well for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Retailmenot (NASDAQ:SALE), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Overstock. com (NASDAQ:OSTK), and Blue Nile (NASDAQ:NILE) - although high expectations are already likely factored into share price.

2013-11-29,EBAY,"IBM, PayPal report strong mobile e-commerce growth on Thanksgiving","IBM estimates mobile devices accounted for 25.8% of U.S. Thanksgiving e-commerce sales (up 49% Y/Y), and have accounted for 21.5% of Black Friday e-commerce sales thus far.
Given mobile accounted for an even larger share of e-commerce traffic (42.6% and 37%, respectively), its conversation rates still notably lag PC levels. But the weakness entirely lies with smartphones (9% of Thanksgiving sales vs. 26.6% of traffic) rather than tablets (16.5% vs. 15.3%).
Google (GOOG
-0.3%), which has been trying to strengthen its tablet search ad prices via Enhanced Campaigns (requires joint PC/tablet ad campaigns), is probably happy to see that.
On the other hand, Google is probably less happy to see that Android accounted for only 12% of of e-commerce traffic and 4.6% of sales, compared with 30% and 21% for iOS (NASDAQ:AAPL). Monetization figures such as those are a key reason why many developers still write for iOS first, in spite of Android's burgeoning market share lead.
Meanwhile, PayPal (EBAY

Foot traffic for both days grew 2.8% to over 1.07B store visits.    Online sales +20% on Thanksgiving and +19% on Black Friday, says IBM.    Mobile traffic accounted for almost 40% of all online visits on Friday. Mobile sales rose to 26% of total online sales on Thursday and were around 22% on Friday.    Increased store openings on Thanksgiving seem to have eaten into sales on Black Friday, while online transactions again took business away from physical purchases.

The average consumer spent $407.02 over the whole weekend, down 3.9% from last year.    The number of shoppers increased to 141M people from 139M.    The fall in spending came after retailers warned of a difficult holiday season and was due to the aggressive bargains on offer, a trend that is expected to continue.    However, the NRF maintained its forecast that retail sales will grow 3.9% for the whole holiday whole season.    Online sales climbed 17.3% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, ComScore estimates, noting that the latter day attracted a record $1.2B in spending. The research firm expects Internet sales to  rise 16%  for the whole of the holiday season.    The most visited sites on Black Friday were those of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Target (NYSE:TGT).

In addition, the transaction fee charged to the latter group will double to 2%.
Amazon has already carried out a string of fee hikes for its on-site fulfillment services. But while merchants have griped, the hikes haven't yet halted Amazon's share gains against EBAY and other rivals. 3rd-party sales accounted for 40% of Amazon's Q3 paid units, and are a relatively high-margin business.

2014-01-16,EBAY,Twitter reportedly partnering with PayPal rival; Stifel starts coverage,"A source tells re/code Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is close to a deal with online payments upstart and PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) rival Stripe to allow it to handle credit card payments from its ~250M monthly users.
The deal could allow Twitter, which entirely relies on ads and (to a lesser extent) data licensing to monetize its platform, to open up a new revenue stream. With many top brands and retailers already advertising on Twitter, there are also opportunities to link marketing campaigns with e-commerce. Chinese microblogging leader Sina already supports online payments.

TechCrunch reports Twitter also considered using PayPal before deciding on Stripe, and is looking to build an e-commerce marketplace similar to the one offered by fellow Jack Dorsey company Square.
Though still the 800-lb. gorilla of online payments, PayPal is facing stiffening competition from Stripe, Amazon (previous), and others when competing for the business of e-commerce sites not named eBay.
PayPal acquired rival Braintree for $800M last September, and more recently addressed an age-old customer complaint by updating its checkout process to fully integrate with merchant sites.

Perhaps not coincidentally, eBay has also authorized a new $5B buyback, which raises its total authorization to $5.6B (good for repurchasing 7% of outstanding shares).
Q1 guidance is for revenue of $4.15B-$4.25B and EPS of $0.65-$0.67, below a consensus of $4.3B and $0.72. 2014 guidance is for revenue of $18B-$18.5B and EPS of $2.95-$3.00, largely below a consensus of $18.5B and $3.12.

2014-01-22,EBAY,"More on eBay: Company opposes PayPal spinoff, trumpets mobile growth","Though Carl Icahn is pushing EBAY to do a PayPal spinoff, the company insists shareholders are better served by the status quo, and justifies its view by pointing to the ties between PayPal and eBay's e-commerce ops.
Icahn's likely reasoning: PayPal is growing faster than the rest of eBay, and its online payments dominance would probably yield a premium valuation in the current environment. PayPal almost certainly accounts for over half of the $70.4B valuation eBay possessed as of today's close.
In Q4, PayPal's revenue rose 19% Y/Y (even with Q3), and accounted for the lion's share of the $1.84B in Payments revenue produced by eBay. Payments volume rose 25% Y/Y to $52B, fueled by 31% growth from non-eBay merchants (boosted by Braintree). Registered accounts rose by 5.2M Q/Q to 143M.
Marketplaces revenue rose 12% Y/Y (also even with Q3) to $2.23B, with GMV (exc. vehicles) rising 13% to $21.5B; the division has been losing share to Amazon. Fixed-price sales now make up 73% of GMV. Enterprise (formerly GSI Commerce) sales fell 2% to $392M.
PayPal and Marketplaces respectively produced $27B and $22B in 2013 mobile transaction volumes, beating prior guidance of $20B. 40% of Marketplaces' Q4 GMV involved ""a mobile touch point.""
$254M was spent on buybacks in Q4; that figure might grow in Q1. Opex rose 9% Y/Y, slower than revenue growth of 14%.

Icahn has told the WSJ that he's prepared to fight a proxy battle in order to win two seats to eBay's board and force the company to spin off PayPal.

Jennifer Bailey, who managed Apple's online stores, has been given the job of building the company' payment business, while  iTunes and App Store chief Eddy Cue has been talking with relevant industry executives.    The report follows Apple patent activity related to mobile payments. With iTunes having 575M registered users, the potential looks rather interesting and the service could pose a serious threat to the likes of PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Square.    Meanwhile, the NYT
reports on an interview that Steve Jobs gave in November 1983 to then Rolling Stone reporter Steven Levy, who's publishing the transcript of the conversation to celebrate 30 years of the Macintosh.

-2.3%) and NCR (NCR
-2.6%) are also lower.
The report left some major questions unanswered. A big one: Will Apple's service only cover transactions taking place in physical stores, or will it also cover mobile e-commerce transactions?
The latter would be a much larger threat to PayPal, which handled $27B worth of mobile transactions (largely e-commerce-related) in 2013, but for now only has a small presence in the offline payments realm (the company is trying hard to change that).
Given Apple's history, an Apple payments service is unlikely to support Android. That could limit merchant interest in regions where Android has a dominant smartphone share (the EU, Latin America, parts of Asia), assuming Apple plans to take the service overseas.

Carl Icahn mentioned payments as a major growth opportunity for Apple last week, highlighting the company's ability to leverage its 575M+ iTunes accounts, fingerprint sensors, and iBeacon.
Analysts expects Apple to report FQ1 EPS of $14.09 (+2% Y/Y) this afternoon, and revenue of $57.46B (+5.4%). Gene Munster believes the Street expects 56M-57M iPhone sales, 24M-25M iPad sales, 4.6M Mac sales, and a gross margin of 37.5% (at the high end of Apple's guidance range)."

Altogether, eBay had $14B in cash/investments at the end of 2013, and $13.4B in debt.
Donahoe reiterates his opposition to Carl Icahn's call to spin off PayPal, but suggests he could eventually change his mind. ""If and when synergies run their course we will be rational in the same way we were rational with Skype.""
For his part, PayPal co-founder/Tesla CEO Elon Musk has told Forbes (in a cover story about PayPal) he backs a PayPal split. ""It doesnât make sense that a global payment system is a subsidiary of an auction website. Itâs as if Target owned Visa or something.""
Forbes' story highlights the culture clash between PayPal and eBay, as PayPal chief David Marcus tries to make the payments giant more agile and mobile-focused. Marcus: ""Itâs a 13,000-person company where weâre changing everything and rewiring the whole culture â¦ At large companies you always find someone with reasons not to do something.""

Icahn, still calling for a PayPal split, notes Andreessen's VC firm was part of an investor group that ""bought 70% of Skype for less than what eBay had paid to acquire it,"" and that it would later be sold to Microsoft for ~3x eBay's sale price.
He also claims Andreessen has made investments in at least five eBay competitors, four of which are PayPal rivals, while on eBay's board.
Icahn observes director Scott Cook is the former CEO of Intuit (INTU - a mobile payments rival to PayPal), and remains on Intuit's board. He also claims a ""pending DOJ complaint"" exists regarding a no-hire pact between eBay and Intuit.
eBay has responded to Icahn's letter. The company: 1) Defends the Skype sale, and says Andreessen was ""recused from all decision making"" related to the deal. 2) Says Andreessen isn't up for re-election to the board. 3) Calls Cook ""an enormous asset"" to eBay's board, and insists the product overlap between eBay and Intuit is small.

-1.1%) has seen a 33% drop in search traffic thanks to Google's (GOOG
+1.3%) new Panda 4.0 algorithm update, and InterActiveCorp's (IACI -1.1%) Ask.com a 50% drop.     Moreover, David Kim, the CEO of SEO firm Wordstream, has done an analysis that suggests eBay has ""lost around 75%"" of its keyword terms from Page 1 of Google's results, and 80% of its more specific (i.e. long-tail) keyword results.     Kim blames the falloff on the fact eBay's search traffic tends to involve doorway pages with ""very little content,"" rather than actual product pages. ""Iâm surprised that Google has allowed these shenanigans to go on for so long.""     He thinks Google's move has the effect of forcing eBay to buy Google's increasingly popular product listing ads (PLAs) to reach search users. eBay is already a PLA client, but (like Amazon) is less dependent on Google ads (and Google traffic in general) than many smaller e-commerce firms.     The algorithm tweak follows changes to the display of Google's AdWords text search ads that lead them to blend in more with organic results, and thus potentially make them more likely to be clicked.     eBay and IAC are underperforming amid Panda-related worries, but they're faring much better than RetailMeNot."

eBay doesn't intend to compensate customers or provide free-credit monitoring, asÂ  the company hasn't detected any fraud, Wenig said. That's despite New York AG  Eric Schneiderman calling for eBay to offer such services.

Facebook claims 200M+ active users for its Messenger service, and recently took the drastic step (in the name of creating a better experience) of requiring mobile users to download a standalone Messenger app to use the service.
As with many other products, Facebook has been cautious with its efforts to monetize Messenger. Marcus' hiring could signal a strategy change.
Marcus won't be running WhatsApp. Facebook has promised WhatsApp will be run independently; co-founder Jan Koum is currently its CEO.
Marcus has been trying to change PayPal's once-cautious culture since becoming head of the online payments giant in 2012, as well as expand its mobile footprint and improve its customer service (often a target of criticism). He admitted earlier this year a culture clash has formed between PayPal and eBay as he pushed ahead with his changes.

The site observes Now has already seen a string of setbacks: eBay's local commerce chief and East Coast operations head have both departed, and some early retail partners such as Best Buy are gone.     CEO John Donahoe downplayed eBay's same-day efforts in February. The company was more upbeat in 2013, promising to bring Now to 25 cities by the end of 2014 with the help of U.K. acquisition Shutl.     Today, eBay only says it's ""focused on supporting"" Now in its 5 current markets, and isn't ""announcing any new market expansions at this time.""     Amazon (AMZN
+1.9%) must be happy to see the report. Unlike eBay and Google (just expanded local delivery to the whole of NorCal), Amazon is relying on its own fulfillment infrastructure (replete with AmazonFresh vans) instead of 3rd-party retailers for same-day. Its strategy has higher up-front costs, but could also allow for more efficient delivery.     eBay continues to trade lower following news of PayPal chief David Marcus' departure.

+0.6%) has struck deals with major Bitcoin (COIN, OTCQB:BTCS) payment processors Coinbase, BitPay, and GoCoin to enable Bitcoin payments for digital content through the PayPal Payments Hub. The Payments Hub allows digital content providers to quickly handle payments via PayPal, credit cards, and other payment types.
Notably, the deal doesn't cover PayPal's own widely-used digital wallet, and also doesn't involve PayPal processing Bitcoin transactions itself. In addition, pre-sales (i.e. payment for a product/service to be delivered later) won't be supported.
PayPal has taken a relatively cautious approach to Bitcoin, even as a number of major firms (inc. Dell, Expedia, Dish Network, and Newegg) have embraced the virtual currency. However, the company's independently-run Braintree unit threw its weight behind Bitcoin earlier this month.
Bitcoin prices, under pressure in recent weeks, have rallied thanks to PayPal's move. Coinbase currently shows a bid-ask spread of $427.29-$427.61."

eBay remains sharply higher, albeit off its premarket highs.

With Marketplaces making up 27% of PayPal's Q2 transactions, overlap between the businesses is deemed ""manageable.""

SunTrust thinks eBay is worth somewhere between $55.72-$88.74/share on a sum-of-the-parts basis. Re/code notes an independent PayPal could have an easier time recruiting talent and battling with upstarts such as Apple and Stripe; the latter has recently scored deals with Facebook and Twitter."

Reason two: Fundamental trends are weaker-than-expected. ""Payments segment appears very top-line strong (especially in the key Merchant Services area), but the investments required to drive this growth have been greater than we anticipated. And Marketplace segment growth is clearly deteriorating, and we are concerned that competition may soon become an acceleratingly difficult challenge.""
Third: ""We believe that EBAY (both the Payments and Marketplaces segments) is entering what may be a sustained investment period with both material marketing and product development spend. Given rising competitive challenges (Apple Pay, Amazon Same Day Delivery, International marketplace competition), we think these sustained investments are likely the right move. But the uncertain payoffs will likely create a pause for most eBay investors.""

Loeb likes how the ""substantial network effect"" that exists for Alibaba's marketplaces both creates a strong moat and allows the company to obtain ""an unrivaled amount of data on Chinese consumers.""
However, it's the ""under-appreciated"" value of Alibaba's other assets, such as its Alipay stake, the Aliyun cloud infrastructure platform, and the China Smart Logistics JV (48%-owned, handled 38% more packages than UPS in FY14) that intrigue him the most. At current levels, Loeb thinks he's effectively getting free call options on these businesses.
Following a near-20% gain on his Sony (SNE

2015-03-17,EBAY,Facebook adds payments support to Messenger,"Facebook (FB
+1.7%) is updating its PC and mobile Messenger apps to allow users to send cash (via debit cards) to friends. A user sending money simply has to tap a $ icon, enter an amount, and tap a Pay button; a PIN can be created to provide security.
Facebook is less than a year removed from hiring ex-PayPal chief David Marcus to run Messenger. Mark Zuckerberg, for his part, has suggested for a while payments will be a part of Facebook's efforts to monetize Messenger, which has 500M+ MAUs thanks in part to Facebook's decision to remove messaging functionality from its core apps.
Many think WhatsApp, currently monetized in some markets via subscription fees, will eventually join rival messaging platforms in supporting payments. Facebook has promised it won't run ads on WhatsApp, and has more broadly argued ads aren't a good way to monetize messaging apps.

Volume (11M shares) has exceeded a 3-month daily average of 8.5M.
Unlike PayPal, Facebook doesn't plan to charge transaction fees for the time being. Mark Zuckerberg has suggested he isn't interested in monetizing Messenger until it hits 1B users.
Though P2P money transfers are a small portion of PayPal's transaction volume, Facebook's service could substantially grow the number of payment card numbers it has on file. The company is in the midst of testing (with the help of PayPal rival Stripe) a Buy button that lets users pay for advertised items without leaving Facebook's site/apps, using previously-saved card data.
Buried within a Bloomberg column about Facebook's payments launch: Facebook says it now has 700M Messenger users. The company reported having 500M MAUs back in November."

The solution takes aim at Stripe, which has often been praised by merchants for offering better and easier integration with their sites than PayPal, as well as providing better management tools and customer support. Stripe, valued at $3.6B in a recent funding round, has a customer base that includes OpenTable, Salesforce, and Rackspace; it has also struck deals to handle payments on Facebook and Twitter's sites/apps.

SunTrust's Bob Peck ($45 target) estimates PayPal's current B2C e-commerce addressable market is worth $45B+, and that its ""stretch"" addressable market (includes remittances, B2B e-commerce, and in-store payments - a lower share has to be assumed) could be worth ~$500B. ""PayPal has 165M active users (including 10M merchants), operates in 200 countries with a support staff of 8,000, and is highly credible as it relates to international (48% of TPV), cross-border (24% of TPV), and global security and regulatory compliance ... PayPal has >$6B in cash ($2B U.S.) and capacity to raise ~$5B in debt (easily maintaining investment grade rating).""
Baird's Colin Sebastian ($45 target): ""PayPal is setting the global standard for online payments with trusted consumer brands and significant scale and reach. Now free from eBay, we believe PayPal can also accelerate newer initiatives beyond its core wheelhouse business (e-commerce).""
Evercore's Ken Sena ($36 target), echoing past remarks, remains worried PayPal could lose share/see margin pressure on mobile, as payment platforms from tech giants that often have access to their users' card data (Apple, Google, Facebook, etc.) gain traction. Nonetheless, he admits Q2 payment volume ($66B, +20% Y/Y) was 3% better than expected, and that the Braintree/Venmo unit is giving a lift to mobile growth.
Meanwhile, when asked in an interview about a potential deal with traditional eBay rival Amazon, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman left the door open to one. ""We have the flexibility to work with any potential merchant partner across the globe ... I donât really like to comment specifically [on potential partners.] Weâve had a wide array of discussions with various partners across the globe.""

2015-07-27,EBAY,"eBay shuttering Now same-day service, three mobile apps","A little over a year after reports surfaced that EBAY plans to shutter its Now same-day delivery service (in test mode), the company has officially done so. An eBay spokeswoman states her company concluded same-day works better for items such as groceries and diapers than for many of eBay's core Marketplace offerings (collectibles, used goods, etc.), and that the logistics of managing same-day deliveries for 3rd-party sellers proved difficult.
She adds eBay continues to ""explore a variety of delivery options such as buy-online-pickup-in-store,"" and that in-store pickup will still be provided at retailers such as Best Buy and Guitar Center. Now had been launched in NYC, Chicago, Dallas, and parts of the Bay Area.
Also getting axed: A Brooklyn pilot program offering same-day deliveries from ~80 local merchants, and eBay's Motors, Fashion, and Valet apps. The company attributes the latter move to a desire to focus on its core app, and eliminate user confusion about which app should be used.
eBay's same-day exit comes as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues rapidly expanding its same-day footprint. The company recently began providing free same-day services to Prime subs in 14 metro areas. Google, meanwhile, continues to invest in same-day services provided for retail partners.
eBay closed down 0.8% today, following markets lower."
2015-09-03,EBAY,"Piper upgrades eBay, calls bad news/business challenges priced in","Believing its valuation now ""suggests limited downside,"" Piper's Gene Munster has upgraded eBay (EBAY
+1.8%) to Neutral. His target is $30.
In spite of the upgrade, Munster still expects further share losses to the likes of Amazon, is critical of eBay's shopping experience, and argues secular e-commerce trends have been working against the company. He thus considers ""a return to general industry growth levels"" unlikely.
Munster: ""While historically consumers have used the internet for price discovery and comparison, we believe that eCommerce has matured such that consumers are more intrigued with eCommerce as a convenience method of shopping. This is disadvantageous to eBayâs experience, which requires some level of hunt-and-peck shopping. Consumers have also come to appreciate the consistency of models like Amazon and retailers, who often have set order, shipping and return policies that give consumers comfort and ease of transaction. Finally, the conciseness of the leading eCommerce experiences are making the full process of hunting for items, checking terms & conditions, and ordering relatively less appealing to consumers.""
Shares are higher on a day the Nasdaq is up 1%."
2015-09-11,EBAY,eBay launching Amazon Prime-like shipping service in Germany,"The eBay Plus shipping service, previously in test mode, will cost â¬19.90 ($22) per year in Germany, and (like Amazon Prime) provide free 2-day delivery for select goods. Free returns are promised for 30 days following a purchase.
VP Carl Gish says the service could be expanded beyond Germany, but hasn't made any promises. Thousands of German sellers are said to have signed up for it.
eBay's (EBAY
+0.4%) lack of an internal warehouse/fulfillment infrastructure similar to Amazon's poses a challenge for its shipping efforts. Amazon, which has been outgrowing eBay in the U.S. and elsewhere, has been estimated by CIRP to have 44M U.S. Prime subs as of June, with a 95% renewal rate."

The bank is still laying out how to play the hike when it invariably comes.    
Strength in balance sheets is what you need, it says, noting that those companies outperform (by an average 5%) in the three months after a rate-boosting cycle begins. In Goldman's ""High Quality Stock"" basket: CMG, DLTR, PEP, KMI, BLK, GOOG, AAPL, PCLN, ORCL, WFC.

Metrics: GMV fell 2% Y/Y in Q3 to $19.6B (it was up 6% excluding forex), after dropping 3% in Q2. U.S. GMV +3%, international GMV -5% (+7% exc. forex). Active buyers +5% Y/Y to 159M. eBay Classifieds and StubHub are said to have delivered ""strong quarters.""

Financials: Cost cuts contributed to the EPS beat: GAAP operating expenses fell 5% Y/Y to $1.09B, thanks to a 9% drop in sales/marketing spend to $565M. R&D spend fell slightly and G&A rose slightly.

2016-10-27,EBAY,Holiday e-commerce sales seen hitting $92B,"There's some mind-blowing numbers out on e-commerce as part of the 2016 Adobe holiday season forecast.
E-commerce sales are expected to increase 11% this year to $91.6B. Though the pace is slower than what was seen in some recent years, it still triples the overall growth rate in retail.
Cyber Monday is set to be the largest online shopping day of all time, with $3.36B in sales anticipated.
Large retailers are seen outpacing smaller retailers by a wide margin, 17% growth vs. 7% growth. That means more market share for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), Best (NYSE:BBY) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) in comparison to chains which already have a harder time leveraging their shipping costs.
Adobe says hot gifts this year will include virtual reality devices, Pokemon, Barbie, Lego, Hot Wheels and Frozen toys.

2017-04-10,EBAY,U.S. teen trends to watch,"Piper Jaffray surveyed U.S. teenagers to see what's hot and what's not.
Positive trends were reported for Apple (previous coverage), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- while Pandora Media (NYSE:P) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) didn't hold up as well in this year's polling.
Food consisted of 24% of a teen's budget to top the 19% spent on clothes. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chick-fil-A both held double-digit ""mindshare"" in the new survey. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) snagged the third place position for favorite restaurant chain. Piper analyst Nicole Regan Miller says McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) remained ""generally strong"" - while Five Guys and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (NASDAQ:RRGB) moved up.  Forget about fashion, say teens. Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Michael Kors (KORS), Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX), The North Face (NYSE:VFC), Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL) and Vineyard Vines all lost relevancy compared to a year ago. In perhaps a surprise, Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) shot up over the last year in teen footwear mindshare in comparison to Nike (NYSE:NKE), scoring especially well with young women.
Heads up GameStop (NYSE:GME) as the highest percentage of teens ever said they plan to download games digitally.
Not a shocker to parents, but Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) topped out the list of favorite ways for a teen to consumer video and Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) was the top ranking social media platform.

2017-05-08,EBAY,Live from Ira Sohn - updates here,"The Sohn Investment Conference is getting underway. Seeking Alpha will donate to charity any subscriptions to SA Pro made through the conference. Up first will be some macro chatter, with Stan Druckenmiller introducing former Fed Governor and current colleague at Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office, Kevin Warsh.

Warsh: The last time he's seen the sort of uniformity of thinking he's seeing now was right before the financial crisis hit. Central banks are behind this current ""gilded age,"" he says. It's been great for the balance sheets of corporations and those individuals and families wealthy enough to even have a balance sheet. Whether it's been good for everyone else and whether it's sustainable is another question.

Warsh: I see risk as highest when market measures of risk are their lowest. Investors should take little comfort from a VIX of 10.
Up next is Corvex Capital's Keith Meister.

Meister: It sounds like he's returning to a telecom infrastructure investing idea (he recommended LVLT at a past Sohn conference). The pitch is for CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL). After the close today, Corvex is going to disclose a position in CTL north of 5%.
Key to his bullishness is the merger with Level 3 - it's a gamechanger, securing CTL's 9% dividend for the long-term. It enhances the EBITDA outlook, including growth through cost synergies. Corvex's base case is 40% upside (including that fat dividend), with 50-70% on the upside.
The best players need to be on the field - he wants CTL's Glen Post and LVLT's Jeff Storey teaming to Â lead the combined company, with Post gradually transitioning out of the company over a period of a few years, and Storey eventually taking charge. When you buy the New England Patriots, you're going to want to be sure Tom Brady is still going to be QB, he says.
Next up is Debra Fine from Fine Capital Partners. Fine runs a highly concentrated portfolio of value names with holding periods measured in years.

Fine: First up is DHX Media (NASDAQ:DHXM), (DMQHF). Kids programming doesn't age, says Fine, and DHX buys old kids shows (think Teletubbies). It's currently trading just north of $5 in Toronto, and Fine thinks it could be worth 4x-5x more.
What's the market missing? Repricing of these old kids shows is underway and will need to take into account advertising parity with kids and adult programming. This is going to fall to DHX's bottom line.
Scheduled for 1:25 ET is Bill Ackman.

Ackman: Wants to talk about the ""risky"" land development business. If you want to find good investment ideas, says Ackman, go to the Forbes 400 and find out where folks in that group made their money. Donald Bren - owner of the master-planned community of Irvine - may be the richest man you've never heard of. But how can we invest in MPCs?
Fans of Bill Ackman won't be surprised to learn the answer is Howard Hughes Corp. (NYSE:HHC) - a company Pershing has been invested in for years (since spun out of GGP in 2010), and in which Ackman happens to be the chairman.
Typical valuation metrics don't work, says Ackman. He prefers a back-of-the-envelope approach. At the current stock price just above $120 per share (and rising since he started talking), investors in HHC are getting major developments in NYC, Hawaii, and 37M square feet of other future development for free.
Breaking until 2:20 ET.
Next up is Palihapitiya Chamath of Social Capital (who last year hit a home run at Sohn with his Amazon pick).

Chamath: He's got a controversial pick, he says ... Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). After noting the remarkable achievements, he takes note of the ""bad,"" i.e. the massively capital-intensive investments the company is planning on. Totally ""unmodelable,"" says Chamath.
He compares what Tesla is set on doing with what Apple did for the cell phone - they completely redefined the market for mobile phones and then mobile computing, and became a 10-bagger.
Is Tesla doing same in the auto business? Yes, argues Chamath. Like the iPhone 3, Tesla's Model 3 will break down the final barriers.
Chamath, however, isn't recommending the common equity, but instead the 2022 convertible bonds. They protect the downside, but capture 95% of the upside if Musk pulls it off. Stand shoulder to shoulder with this generation's Thomas Edison, concludes Chamath.
Next up is David Serra from Algebris Investments.

Serra: The United Kingdom is really the Divided Kingdom, he says, calling the U.K. a broken growth model - dependent on imports, weak public finances, high household leverage, stagnant productivity, growing social imbalances.
The takeaway: Go short long-dated Gilts, which currently yield more than 200 basis points less than 10-year inflation expectations. Then there's the cost of Brexit - 7% of GDP over the next few years.
Notable U.K. ETFs: FXB, EWU, OTC:GBB, EWUS, FKU, DXPS, DBUK, QGBR, HEWU

Next up is Clifton Robbins from Blue Harbour Group.

Robbins: Blue Harbour now owns just under 10% of Investors Bancorp (NASDAQ:ISBC). There are multiple ways to win with the stock, currently trading at just 1.35x book value - a signifiant discount to peers at more than 2x book.
Loan growth has been speedy, but at the same time, credit quality has been better than competitors. In addition to being a well-run bank, this lender stands to benefit more than most from lower corporate taxes and regulatory reform.
There's also excess capital (12.9% tangible capital ratio vs. 9% for peers). The bank, says Robbins, is sitting on $1B of excess capital - money that can be used to grow the business and buy back stock (Blue Harbour has board representation). One more catalyst - ISBC makes for an attractive acquisition target. Robbins thinks this $13 stock could be worth $18.50 based on recent comps.
Coming up - Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn.

Einhorn: Core Labs (NYSE:CLB) is the pick, but it's not sounding like he's long. The company has been mistakenly hyped as a secular growth story, says Einhorn. If secular, than why the sharp slowdown in earnings?
Reading the company's annual reports is like reading a time capsule of whatever happens to be trendy at the time, he says. Core, he says, is riding the exploration capex cycle just like everyone else. Where there is opportunity (low margin shale) is not in the area where Core can make a lot of money - deepwater drilling. Far higher oil prices are necessary for that to come back.
The stock is all over the place as Einhorn's initial comments led folks to believe he's bullish, but now - after the day's most entertaining presentation - it's crystal clear he's short. Shares areÂ down 2%.
Jeff Gundlach is on tap for 4:15 ET.

Gundlach:Â His early comments suggest he's about to shoot a hole in the passive investing mania. He notes the large majorities of active managers that have failed to hit their bogies, and the massive flow of cash into passive strategies. Passive investing is a myth anyway, he says. It's just turning investment decisions over to a committee at S&P, for instance.
U.S. valuations, he says, have gotten out of whack, and markets have already begun to catch on. His recommendation: Go long emerging markets (NYSEARCA:EEM), and go short the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY).
Sohn idea contest winners coming now.
Wharton student Dylan Adelman is the winner. Introducing him, David Einhorn says he was so impressed with the idea, he wanted to buy it right away. His pick is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).
Next up is Brad Gerstner from Altimeter Capital.

Gerstner: The ""online-travel king"" sounds like he's making a bullish call on the airline industry (NYSEARCA:JETS), noting years of investor skepticism and low valuations despite a material change in prospects. What's happened? Dramatic consolidation. With consolidation comes an end to destructive price wars.
After falling on an inflation-adjusted basis forever, ticket prices are actually on the rise. Airlines have trimmed the fat so much that they'll stay profitable even if prices fall.
His long idea: United (NASDAQ:UAL) - new management (which Gerstner had a part in) is making all the right moves. He sees a $135 stock in 2020 (80% upside) on a base case, and even higher in a modestly bullish case.
Next up is Josh Resnick from Jericho Capital.

Resnick: His pitch is a short of Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR). Why short a $1.50 stock that down 70% Y/Y? Because there's a 100% return to be made, he says (he's been short for five years).
The company, he says, is going bankrupt. Step one is the elimination of the dividend (it's already been sizably slashed). Step two will be the breaking of covenants.
Next up and last is Larry Robbins from Glenview Capital.
DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC), FMC Corp (NYSE:FMC), and Quintiles IMS Holdings (Q) are his picks. All three are reasonably valued - about 12x earnings - despite big moves higher of late. In DXC's case, the stock has doubled over the last year, but the earnings power has grown even more - the stock could double again."

""During our time as shareholders of eBay, it has become increasingly clear that the current Board has had difficulty making the critical decisions that the Company has needed, as evidenced by the delay in making a CEO change that seemed inevitable after sustained underperformance, acceptance of a subpar operating plan following an eight-month-long Operating Review, as well as the delay in the Strategic Review of eBay's non-core businesses.""
""We are primarily focused on the CEO search process and the development of an improved operating plan. In our view, the CEO search process and the development of an improved operating plan are directly and inextricably linked.""
""We strongly believe that eBay should be focused on identifying qualified external candidates in order to hire a new CEO that will bring a fresh perspective and energy to the Company after its prolonged underperformance.

Analyst Justin Post crunches the numbers - ""If we assume Classifieds is sold at an 8x 2021E Revenue multiple, a premium multiple considering the high margin profile (30%+ non-GAAP operating margin), we would get an $8.3bn valuation for the segment, in the lower half of the reported possible bid range at $8bn to $10bn. An $8.3bn value for Classifieds would imply a 21x multiple on our 2021 profit estimate of $389mn (segment profit is referred to as a non-GAAP operating margin, which could be close to EBITDA). We think a 21x segment multiple could be in-line with the higher end of recent transactions in the classifieds space.""

Markets have been rocked by volatility in recent sessions as fears of a second Covid-19 wave and a slower-than-expected reopening weigh on markets. The S&P 500 has lost 4.8% over the last five sessions.
Inflation expectations have also eased in recent sessions, with the yield curve flattening.
Bank of America ran a screen looking at stocks whose performance is negatively correlated to inflation. If a less inflationary backdrop materializes, these ""anti-inflation"" stocks could be well positioned.
We used Seeking Alpha's screening tools to sort Bank of America's top 20 ""anti-inflation"" names based on their Seeking Alpha quant rankings. Here were the top 5:

Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)
Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)
The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX)
Jack Henry & Associates, Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY)

Seven out of 10 of the most negatively correlated stocks to inflation on the Bank of America list were in the Consumer Discretionary sector, suggesting elements within the segment provide an element of security in a lackluster growth environment.
Broadening the scope, and using Seeking Alpha's screening tool, the following stocks in the consumer discretionary sector with the highest quant rankings included:

The firm outlined its bullish views on some key tech holdings that drove the quarter's outperformace:

PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL): Shares posted their best performance since the company was spun out of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) as COVID-19 boosts demand for digital payments. Wedgewood expects PYPL ""will continue to enable more merchants to quickly shift their offerings to an online or contactless payment experience, in the face of dramatically changing consumer behavior.""
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): Generates enormous operating cash flows to fund multi-billion R&D and capex budgets, while returning capital to shareholders. AAPL is ""one of the rare companies that excels at accretive earnings per share buybacks,"" the firm said.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): The position remains a meaningful overweight, as it offers growth and a reasonable valuation multiple, currently a rare combo.
Wedgewood Partners also cited some healthcare and value-oriented stocks as key detractors to performance over the quarter. These included Bristol-Myers (NYSE:BMY), Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) and Alcon (NYSE:ALC).
But outside of stock picking, Wedgewood also outlined the centrality of the Federal Reserve over the last quarter in a section titled ""In Fed We Trust.""
""The mind still reels given what has transpired during this fateful year,"" the investor letter said, noting that it was remarkable the S&P 500 held up as well as it did.
""The Federal Reserveâs omnipotent liquidity firepower has thus far easily trumped the social and economic devastations wrought by the pandemic,"" it added."

The decision gives a surprise boost to a bid from Norwegian online marketplace Adevinta ASA (OTCPK:ADEVF), which offered a mix of cash and stock and would leave eBay with a significant stake in the combined business.
It would also lessen the chances Prosus N.V. (OTCPK:PROSY) will win the hotly-contested auction  after submitting the highest, all-cash offer for the entire unit.

2020-07-21,EBAY,eBay sells classified ads unit in $9.2B cash and stock deal,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is selling its classified ad business to Norway's Adevinta (OTCPK:ADEVF) for $9.2B in cash and stock, making the latter the largest online classifieds company globally.
As part of the transaction, eBay will receive $2.5B in cash and approximately 540M Adevinta shares - representing 44% ownership of the pro forma company and a ~33.3% voting stake - and making it the biggest shareholder of Adevinta.
The deal is expected to close by Q1 of 2021 and is forecast to create estimated annual synergies of $150M-185M within the next three years.
Adevinta is majority owned by Schibsted (OTCPK:SBSNF), which has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction and will acquire eBay Classifieds' Danish entity.
The deal is the culmination of a process that began in March 2019 when the company agreed to a review of its classifieds business and StubHub, as activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value pushed for a focus on eBay's core business to improve profitability.
eBay completed its sale of online ticket broker StubHub to Viagogo for $4B in February, but it has been flagged by U.K. regulators for further review.
eBay wanted to keep a stake in its online classifieds business, which includes Gumtree in the U.K. and Kijiji in Canada, putting Adevinta in pole position for the deal. Rival bidder Prosus was reportedly reluctant to to agree to a minority stake.

2020-12-04,EBAY,Global eCommerce retail transactions jump 30% from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday,"New benchmark data from ACI Worldwide
(NASDAQ:ACIW) revealed a 21% Y/Y increase in eCommerce transactions globally in November, driven by strong consumer demand for household items and services, especially those providing shipment, remote education and training, and insurance for consumer electronics.
The retail sector saw a significant increase of 30% over the five-day period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday in 2020 compared to 2019.
The Saturday after Black Friday experienced the biggest increase at 47% Y/Y.
The average ticket price on these peak days declined by 3% Y/Y from $136 to $132, as consumers are attracted to free shipment and sales.
âThis yearâs holiday season is looking very different from previous years with many merchants starting sales much earlier, as well as continuing promotions beyond the traditional peak days of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The result is a substantial increase in eCommerce transaction volumes prior to Black Friday,â said Debbie Guerra, executive vice president, ACI Worldwide. âIn addition, many merchants expanded their buy-online-pick-up-in-store and free next-day delivery options, which attracted many consumers.â
Fraud attempt rates by volume increased slightly to 1.7% by volume and 3.4% by value, similar to prior holiday seasons and Non-fraud chargebacks increased by 15% Y/Y in October.
âAlthough fraud rates have increased only slightly, merchants and consumers do need to be vigilant. Consumers should avoid leaving packages on their doorsteps for long periods of time to avoid porch piracy, as this has been an area of growing concern over the years. As the buy-online-pick-up-in-store channel continues to experience fast growth driven by the pandemic, it is providing greater opportunity for fraudsters,ââ Guerra concluded.
Global eCommerce transactions increased by 20% YTD.
Travel and ticketing continued to see a significant dip in November due to the pandemic, declining 60% and 85%.
